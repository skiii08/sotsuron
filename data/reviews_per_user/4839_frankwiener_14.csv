Vertigo," In Circular Motion
","From the very start, Saul Bass's innovative introduction, reportedly the first ever to use computer graphics, sets the film's overall circular motif in motion. The physically debilitating condition of vertigo, which is triggered by the central character's acrophobia, is the engine that generates all of the events that follow.Several reviewers here focus on this film's status as 'number one' among at least some lists devised by critics who actually dare to rank movies, and these same writers spend an inordinate amount of time and effort challenging its high position. For what it's worth, I have created a list of my favorite 150 movies of all time, and 'Vertigo' is right there along with seven other of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, but I personally find the numerical ranking of movies, including the best of them, to be all but impossible. How could I rank the movies that I love the most? I find it interesting that Bernard Hermann based his remarkable, ever changing musical score on the Wagner opera, 'Tristan and Isolde'. Although I am not an opera expert, that music has always suggested a circular motion much in the same way that Hermann's score, especially the opening theme, creates the dizzying sensation that the physical condition of vertigo produces in its victims. James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes are excellent in their roles, especially Stewart, whose character, John (Scotty) Ferguson, experiences a wide range of powerful and complicated psychological conditions, which could not have been easy to portray. Regardless of how Hitchcock was reported to feel about her performance, I believe that Novak brings just the right amount of mystery, intricacy, and physical beauty to both Madeleine and Judy. Lana Turner, also considered for the lead, would not have offered the same depth and complexity to the role. I also appreciated supporting cast members Ellen Corby as the cautious and peculiar apartment house manager (did she know more than what she appeared to know?) and Henry Jones as the anal retentive trial official who publicly humiliates Ferguson in a devastatingly cruel way.In addition to the excellent direction, musical score, and acting, the magnificent cinematography of Robert Burks, who maximizes the photogenic setting of San Francisco and its picturesque surroundings, and the intelligent screenplay by Samuel A. Taylor have kept 'Vertigo' on my own list of favorites after nearly six decades and many repeated viewings. Just don't ask me to rank it.",9,5,7,8 January 2017
Dead Poets Society," I Not Only Seized the Day, I Became an English Major
","My best teacher in high school and my favorite professors during my first couple of years in college taught English. Even without their heavy influence on my highly pliable mind at the time, English was my favorite subject, so I not only 'seized the day', but I seized the whole subject as my major. That was a much greater commitment to the dead poets than the highly privileged young men at Weldon Academy ever even dreamed about. Coming from a lower middle class family and completing twenty years of formal education entirely in the public system with virtually no connections anywhere, I decided that I didn't want to teach or pursue the law profession, and the world decided that I didn't have the talent to earn a living as a writer or even as an editor of actual, able writers. I had seized much more than the day, but where the heck was I in terms of the 'real' world, especially when those pesky bills started arriving for food, rent, insurance premiums and the like?I am in no way defending the narrow-minded oppression and rigidity of education at Weldon Academy, but having experienced what I have in life, there is something to be said for a practical education that prepares one well for the cold reality of what follows the world of classrooms and blackboards. There must be a middle ground somewhere. Just don't ask me where it lies. If you passionately love science, math and information technology, you will never understand what I'm even talking about. Lucky you! In the end, I was forced to pursue another degree that was easier to utilize in the world in which we live, whether we approve of it or not. That having been said, I loved my years as an English major, and I obtained an education that no other subject could have provided me. The problem was landing on my rear end on the day after graduation in an economically wounded post-Vietnam War era when no one was even remotely interested in my essays on the works of William Butler Yeats.As one who seized far more than just a day, I truly appreciate this film. I can't recall any movie featuring Robin Williams that I ever disliked, sometimes only because of his presence and not because of the rest of the movie. There is no need to describe the terrible circumstances of his end, which are so very sad to all of his fans, including me. In order to appreciate this film fully, one had to be alive in the highly conformist world of 1959, the year in which it occurred. I so despise the character of Mr. Perry, Neil's status obsessed father, not only because I have unfortunately known so many men and women like him in my life and because he alone drove his son to his tragic end but because he failed to acknowledge for even a moment his own responsibility in Neil's death and instinctively shifted the entire blame to the school and specifically to Mr. Keating, his unfortunate scapegoat. Who hasn't painfully witnessed this despicable behavior in real life? Kurtwood Smith played the part perfectly, as did Hitchcock veteran Norman Lloyd in the role of the headmaster, and all of the actors who played the young men were also good. I credit the overall performance of such a young cast and much more than that to director Peter Weir ('Picnic at Hanging Rock', 'Gallipoli', 'Witness', just to name a few). The sequences of the guys moving through the fields in and around the real St. Andrew's School in Delaware were beautifully filmed.",8,2,2,18 April 2020
The Best Years of Our Lives," The Battle After
","This film, expertly and passionately directed by William Wyler, is a captivating glimpse of America immediately following World War II when scores of veterans returned home from dangerous and distant battles overseas. The story is centered on three servicemen who had each endured combat, respectively on land, at sea, and in the air, and who find themselves back in their fictitious home town of Boone City, which is patterned after Cincinnati. Having dreamed on the battlefront of reuniting with those they love in the familiar, peaceful environment of civilian life, are they adequately prepared for the transition from one world to another? Each of the men carry their battle scars, both physically and mentally, from the war to the 'peaceful' existence of Boone City. As the superbly directed, explosive drugstore scene indicates, the sad reality is that post-war Boone City, as a microcosm of America itself, is anything but peaceful.Aside from Wyler's outstanding direction, the screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood is very perceptive and often very touching. As moved as I am by the exchanges between Homer and Wilma during the film, I didn't realize just how powerful their dialogue is until I re-read the words in the 'quotes' section on this website. I'm not ashamed to say that I bawled like a baby when I read at least some of these genuinely heart-rending words, and that is not a frequent occurrence for me.I can't praise the cast enough, both the leads and the support, especially the three men who play the vets, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and, last but never least, Harold Russell, a non-professional actor who managed to nail two different Oscars for his very credible portrayal of disabled Homer Parish. I also agree with the one reviewer who states that of the three leading men, the best performance comes from the guy who didn't win an Oscar at all, Dana Andrews, in what may be the best role of his lifetime. That having been said, March's drunken speech before the bank bosses at the Cornbelt Loan and Trust is one of the movie's several 'high' moments, and initially made me as anxious as his wife, played by Myrna Loy, but all's well that ends well.The three leading women, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, and Cathy O'Donnell are excellent as well. While this very important role launched O'Donnell's all too brief career ('They Live By Night', 'Ben-Hur'), it was eventually stifled by producer Samuel Goldwyn only because she married the older brother of director Wyler, with whom Goldwyn was feuding, before she tragically succumbed to cancer at the young age of forty six.Virginia Mayo fought for the role of Marie Derry, the selfish, unlikeable wife of Fred (Andrews), who had not fallen in love with Fred as much as the uniform that he wore. I'm glad that Mayo landed the part because no one could deliver Marie's nasty, sneering lines as well. 'There are drugstores everywhere!' Ouch! You sure know how to hurt a guy, Marie, especially one who sacrificed so much for your freedom, and you sure love your freedom, sweetheart.",9,1,1,27 November 2017
The Caine Mutiny," The Strawberry Affair
","Although this movie has a few serious flaws, it manages to overcome them, thanks to an outstanding cast, a, snappy script, and the very serious subject matter surrounding the mental stability of a military officer. Another solid attribute is Max Steiner's score, especially the muscular themes that so magnificently accompany the sailing ships at the beginning and the end, a moving and meaningful tribute to the US Navy.The movie, to me, is rather sluggish for the first half hour until Bogey finally appears as the enigmatic Lt. Commander Queeg. If you're a fellow Bogey fan, you can count on another one of his many outstanding performances to maintain your interest to the end.The sub-plot involving Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis) and May Wynn (the actual name of the actress is also May Wynn) is not only unnecessary but goes so far as to degrade the rest of the film, preventing it from being the great work that it otherwise would be. Although 'I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me' is a sweet, little ditty, couldn't Ms. Wynn just sing the song as a nightclub act without all of the rest? And is the excursion to Yosemite merely a deliberate attempt to offer viewers relief from the claustrophobia of the dilapidated ship or a promotional ad by the National Park Service? Notice that there were no mobs of tourists and exasperating traffic jams at Yosemite back in 1954. It must have been nice, but I wouldn't know.No wonder that Bogey fought for this role and agreed to accept reduced compensation for it. He was undoubtedly drawn by the challenge of Queeg's complicated character and circumstances, so, in response, how could we as viewers not appreciate his captivating portrayal of Queeg? He also receives strong support from Van Johnson as Lt. Steve Maryk in one of his best performances ever, from Fred MacMurray, as the pompous, cynical, and gutless Lt. Tom Keefer, from Jose Ferrer as Maryk's reluctant and conscience stricken defense lawyer, Lt. Barney Greenwald, and, last but not least, from Tom Tully as Queeg's dedicated but sea weary predecessor, Commander de Vriess. Do you remember Tully as Ginger Rogers' kindly, understanding uncle in the very melancholy 'I'll Be Seeing You'? These two memorable and widely differing roles demonstrate the depth of Tully's overlooked acting ability. On the other hand, Francis is painfully out of his league with this seasoned bunch.I don't want to reveal too much about the military trial to those who haven't seen the movie, but no matter how psychologically unstable Lt. Commander Queeg may be, especially at a moment of crisis, the question of a possible combat disability inevitably arises, and it's up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. Should an officer's disability be ignored until he becomes a very real threat to his ship and to the lives of his men? The answers to the questions raised here are not simple, and the lack of clarity at the end adds to the movie's thought-provoking depth.And what of Lt. Tom Keefer, the derisive and disdainful novelist-intellectual who instigates the humiliating campaign against Queeg but then lacks the 'guts' to stand up and to take responsibility for his actions? I couldn't help from wondering whether the original novelist, Herman Wouk, questioned his own position as a writer who hides from the line of fire behind the safety shield of a typewriter. See this one for the intelligence of its challenging content, for its hard hitting dialogue, and for the exceptionally talented cast, at least for the most part, who successfully bring a powerful script to life.",7,1,1,29 April 2019
North by Northwest," Mr. Thornhill's Thorny Ordeal
","Wedged between the making of two very serious, psychological suspense films, 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho', director Alfred Hitchcock created a very different kind of thriller, one consisting largely of comedy, both subtle and obvious, thanks in part to the talent of scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman. Hitchcock and Lehman started with three seemingly unrelated ideas, (1) a mistaken identity, (2) a chase scene through the United Nations, and (3) a spectacular finale at Mount Rushmore. They then wove these three events into one cohesive story, a fascinating creative process by itself.As to the acting, I have seen Cary Grant in many movies, including a number of mediocre items and even worse than that, but he provides the perfect Roger Thornhill with his dry, natural wit and suave, elegant appearance. Whenever I am faced with life's adversities, I only need to recall how Roger would approach the situation with his coolness and muted sense of humor. The fact that Grant did not understand Lehman's script only authenticates his genuine state of confusion as he is pursued from New York City to Rapid City, South Dakota by way of Chicago and some very dry Indiana cornfields. As the mysterious Eve Kendall, Eva Marie Saint is a very different woman indeed from her Oscar winning performance as Edie Doyle in 'On the Waterfront', and she never ceases to intrigue us as a woman who is far more independent and sexually assertive than we would normally expect in 1959. And who could deliver those caustic, cynical lines as well as James Mason in the part of the deceptively 'respectable' villain, Philip van Damm? Grant and Mason are an outstanding match, and they bring this film to a high level (no pun intended when you consider the ending) that it may not have achieved without their dynamic interaction.Throughout the film, subtle undercurrents flow beneath the surface, including Thornhill's curious relationship with his undermining mother (Jesse Royce Landis), which may by itself explain his previous two divorces. Then there is the quirky jealousy of van Damm's assistant thug, Leonard (Martin Landau). When I first viewed this film at the innocent age of ten, I didn't appreciate the symbolism of the speeding train through the tunnel at the end, but I was nevertheless very impressed by the overall visual power created by Hitchcock, not only here but in many of his other productions as well.There were many memorable cinematic moments in this film, including an extraordinary aerial shot of Thornhill escaping from the United Nations building, a sudden showdown involving a man, a speeding oil tanker, and a menacing crop duster, and several, breathtaking shots from atop Mount Rushmore, both real and manufactured. As was the case with the Statue of Liberty in 'Saboteur', the power of the monument is enhanced even more by the director's dramatic camera angles as it stands as an invincible symbol of the freedom that the evil elements in the film want to destroy.The success of 'North By Northwest' is shaped by a combination of winning attributes, including a very gifted director, a sharp, snappy screenplay by Lehman, superb cinematography by Robert Burks, an effectively moody musical score by Bernard Hermann, and some first-rate acting.",9,6,8,1 January 2018
Judgment at Nuremberg," The Bright Line of Guilt, Blurred
","In spite of the outstanding cast, their captivating performances, and the expert direction of Stanley Kramer, this film is very disturbing for many different reasons. I sat down and listed at least a few of the reasons. 1. It reveals the indisputable fact that so many high level officials in the Third Reich eventually were allowed to enjoy the carefree lives of retirement from which their millions of victims were deprived by the most cruel and inhumane means imaginable. In fact, how many of these high level Third Reich officials were even tried in the first place? We should not expect any true sense of justice in our world, which is very unsettling by itself.2. Defense Attorney Hans Rolfe, played forcefully by Maximillian Schell in an Oscar winning role, is correct. The guilt for the genocide that occurred in Europe during World War II extends far beyond Germany alone. The human race itself is guilty not only for directly committing unspeakable acts of cruelty against itself but for allowing others to exercise such brutality when it was clearly known by so many all over the world at the time. The situation exists today while hundreds of thousands of people, including many innocent civilians, are dying in the Syrian civil war, for example, while certain so-called 'leaders' of the world not only refuse to stop it but consciously support and promote its barbarity. We're not talking about the distant past in this case. It's happening today.3. As the established laws of the Third Reich were in themselves cruel and inhumane, how much should we expect from the average person in any official position when the prevailing law of the land is intrinsically evil as well as enormously powerful? When I look around me today, how many respectable Americans in the place of Ernst Janning, played brilliantly by Burt Lancaster as a renown legal scholar of his time, would actively resist such a formidable system of malevolence? Who among us would be strong enough to fight such an overwhelming, sinister establishment without fear of dire and deadly consequences? Ernst Janning surely did not resist the Third Reich as he willingly and knowingly carried out its despicable laws.4. In spite of the huge sacrifices of so many Americans on and off the battlefield of World War II, many Americans also believed, as Judge Curtiss Ives (Ray Teal) did, that these high German officials, in this case very influential judges, were 'merely' applying the prevailing laws of their government as they were supposed to do, regardless of how nefarious those laws were, and therefore should not be punished at all. Chief Judge Dan Haywood, the no-nonsense and often very blunt Mainer, played very sagaciously by Spencer Tracy, reminded Ives that mere logic and the professional duty to enforce evil laws did not overrule the need to do what is right before an even higher authority or to one's own conscience. Unfortunately Ives, who obviously resented the inconvenience of his appointment to the tribunal from the very start, totally rejected Haywood's prudent observations. Was he even listening to Haywood? If Teal, the actor, was supposed to annoy me to such an extreme, he certainly succeeded.5. The war caused immense physical and psychological suffering, not only to the brutalized victims of the Third Reich but to the German people themselves. If they had starved and deteriorated as a society to such an extent following the first world war, wasn't there another path to their recovery than the one that they had consciously chosen as a nation?The fact that Nuremberg was the site of huge, enthusiastic rallies led by Adolph Hitler never escaped the mind of the director, Stanley Kramer, and he very effectively reminded the viewer of this irony. Kramer also emphasized that Schell's and Lancaster's speeches were the most important in the courtroom by dramatically zooming in and out of them. Under the circumstances, I wonder if this technique was even necessary.Aside from the first-rate performances of Schell, Lancaster, and Tracy, I was especially impressed by Marlene Dietrich's portrayal of Mrs. Bertholt, the refined widow of an executed German officer. To me, Mrs. Bertholt, of noble stock, effectively symbolized a shattered, post-World War II Germany in more ways than one. As she sat in the frozen silence of the last scene, what could have been passing through her embittered mind as the phone continued to ring unanswered? Although Mrs. Berthold felt an unbearable, personal sense of injustice as a result of the war, did she even begin to understand her own responsibility as an upstanding German citizen while atrocities on a mass scale were being committed in her name and from every direction around her? Did she not know or did she choose not to know about them? For Ms. Dietrich, who actively opposed the politics of the Third Reich but never abandoned a deep love for her native country and culture, this was a very important and emotional moment in her career. I could feel her quiet intensity, veiled in social correctness, throughout her performance.Not all great movies have happy endings with clear resolutions. This movie, truly a great one, may not have had even one genuinely happy moment within it, but it must be seen by all who seek to understand the circumstances behind one of the most traumatic periods in human history. If there are no clear answers, we still need to ask the many, necessary questions. If we don't ask them, we risk repeating the mistakes and the horrors of the past.",9,1,2,21 August 2016
Gone with the Wind," A Film of War Produced During Anxious Times
","Since I initially wrote this review on July 8, 2016, there have been no less than 135 additional user reviews of this film in only three years and six months. Some of these reviews are good and some are terribly written with no actual explanation of the writer's rating or opinion. On the 'helpful' list, this review appears as 'number 60', at least at the moment, so I have no idea how any IMDb reader will ever find this addendum. At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary 'The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind', directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself. As I state below, my one criticism of the film is its unnecessarily long duration, especially the disappointing second half which fails to sustain the drama and spectacle of the first half.In my view, this movie is primarily about a catastrophic war, specifically the American Civil War, and it illustrates how this war so seriously impacted not only two extended families but an entire region, the American South. It is particularly significant to me that this movie, about the horrors of a major war, was made in 1939, a time when much of the world had already been thrust into another major war, World War II, and when many Americans must have been considering the consequences of our country's potential involvement in that war upon their own lives, upon their own personal situations. The world had become a very frightening place in 1939, and, although the United States had not yet entered the war, many informed, educated Americans must have been very concerned and even anxious about the very real possibility that the raging conflict overseas might one day arrive on their doorstep, including all of the uncertainty, disruption, and physical danger that would inevitably follow.Some viewers may appreciate the love scenes and the soap opera aspects of this cinematic epic, but what I find far more compelling is the dramatic circumstance of the characters who are suddenly immersed, some willingly and others involuntarily, in the middle of the bloodiest and most traumatic war ever to occur on American soil. I agree with other reviewers who wrote that the movie is too long. I believe that at least one hour could have been cut from it without destroying any meaningful continuity. After the explosive action of the first half, the second half appears somewhat anti-climactic and even boring for me.This movie is dominated by the central character of Scarlett O'Hara, so powerfully played by a stunningly beautiful Vivian Leigh. All of the other characters, especially the males, seem to pale in comparison to her with the exception of two of her slaves, played marvelously by Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who both manage to upstage Scarlett herself, which was not an easy feat. I realize that these were indeed tough times for the State of Georgia, and one had to be strong and determined in order to survive in such difficult circumstances, but did Scarlett have to be ruthless to the extent that she would steal her own sister's beau, a man she did not even love but decided to marry only on account of the economic potential of his hardware store, including its promising lumber business? Some may say that she only did this so that Tara could survive. Would that alone justify her callous, almost inhuman, behavior?The scenes of beaten, war ravaged Atlanta are very impressive, especially for their time, and must have been a daunting task for the director, Victor Fleming. Although the music and frequent scenes of blazing sunsets behind dead trees have become clichés in time, I think that they were much more effective before 'Gone With the Wind' became such a widely familiar cinematic classic to us. In many regards, 'Gone With the Wind' has become a victim of its own huge success in the way that its most famous scenes, music, and characters have become too familiar to us and the object of constant spoofing, satire, and even derision. What a shame.To me, this is a 'must see film', not only for Ms. Leigh's remarkable performance but for the historical drama that is so effectively portrayed as the South becomes tragically victimized by the very war that many had initially glorified so unrealistically. The reality of war's horror, conveyed so convincingly in this film, is its most important message. A world in a state of peace and prosperity must never be taken for granted. No one would agree with this more than Scarlett O'Hara herself, a casualty of a major conflict that she never wanted in the first place. Of course, Ms. O'Hara would never allow herself to be victimized by anything or anyone for very long. In any case, 'she's not going to worry about that today. She'll worry about that tomorrow.'",8,9,13,8 July 2016
The Elephant Man," I am a human being!
","Even before I realized that David Lynch directed this film and was specifically in charge of its sound design, I immediately recognized his trademark background effects, which reminded me of the constant drone of old industrial machinery, from 'Eraserhead', which he had directed three years earlier. Although my unfavorable review of the earlier film has received a mostly 'useless' response from IMDb readers, I am not here to win any popularity contests, and that review stands exactly as is. To this day, thanks to 'Eraserhead', a film I admittedly couldn't understand or appreciate, I can't look at a roasted chicken in a supermarket without wanting to throw up. Perhaps this was Mr. Lynch's deliberate intention. At any rate, what a difference three years makes as my reaction to this film was totally the opposite. That producer Mel Brooks had the vision to select Lynch as the director here was a stroke of genius. Brooks could see what I could not. That explains his success and my sitting here at a keyboard as a washed-up old geezer passing judgment on the actual, creative achievements of others. Although the subject matter and atmosphere of this film is as bleak as that of 'Eraserhead', the visual depiction of Victorian England and the impact of the industrial revolution on the nation as a backdrop was fascinating, as was the unique and compelling story. While the true story of the real Joseph Merrick was fictionalized for the film, I had no problem viewing it as a work of fiction that was based on factual circumstances. It wasn't the first, won't be the last, and no one pretended otherwise.At one point, Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick's physician, asks his wife, 'Am I good man or a bad man?' This is one of the key questions of the film. Once he 'discovered' Merrick and began medically treating him, was Treves more interested in the well-being of his extraordinary patient or in his own professional or social standing. If his priority was on himself, how were his motivations different from those of evil Bytes, Merrick's original captor, even if Treves did treat Merrick far more kindly and introduced him to British royalty and high society along the way? While Treves found comfortable shelter for his patient at the hospital, what good was that accommodation when he could not guarantee Merrick's safety from the torment of the night watchman and eventually of the very real threat by Bytes himself. It was almost as if Treves set Merrick up for disaster by failing to protect him from the terrible sequence of events that followed Merrick's admission to the hospital. In answer to Treves' question, I would say that the jury is still out, Doc. I'm just not sure about you or your motivations, dude.The cast was high caliber, but I felt that Hopkins and Bancroft, one of the most talented and versatile actresses of her time, were wasted in their muted roles, preventing them from demonstrating their true potential. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller, two very experienced veterans, were excellent. Although the Oscars don't sway me one way or another, I will have to view 'Raging Bull' again to understand how John Hurt lost out to DeNiro in the category of Best Actor. My memory is shot.This is a film that very effectively illustrates just how cruel humans can be to each other and how even the best intentions can result in disastrous consequences. While humans did not create John Merrick's horrible condition and while some acts of kindness at least partially compensated for overwhelming meanness and selfishness, he deserved much more compassion from us. Now let us go outside and practice in real life what we have learned today. Be kind.",8,1,1,30 October 2017
A Clockwork Orange," Ouch! My Hurting Eyes
","After seeing this generally disagreeable assault on the senses, I need a rest now, possibly even a rest home for a while.I last saw this turkey when it was released in 1971, the year that I graduated from college. I couldn't appreciate it at the age of 22 and still don't like it at the ripe old age of 67. I decided to watch it again because I had just viewed Kubrick's outstanding 'Paths of Glory', one of the best films that I have ever seen on the subject of war and the arrogant abuse of power, and I was very curious as to why IMDb subscribers rated this film a stunning 8.3, which is very rare for any movie and ranks it as one of the top 100 movies of all time. After my second viewing, I'm at an even bigger loss about this very high rating and ranking than I was 45 ago.I believe that the often unbearable level of intense brutality in this movie is enough to provoke actual, real-life bloodshed in persons who are already inclined to be violent, specifically against women and defenseless elderly people. As my country, the USA, is currently experiencing a very dangerous epidemic of horrifying, violent incidents, including several recent mass murders, movies such as this, are not at all helpful to our present situation, which has become a national crisis. I can't see a single benefit of this violence to me as a viewer or to my society as a whole. That having been said, I still believe in the first amendment and in freedom of expression, but after seeing this relentless display of viciousness, most of which seems to be merely for its own sake or perhaps fulfills a desire to shock viewers and for no other purpose, I find myself struggling with my own deepest convictions.I read several of the glowing reviews of this movie by others on IMDb. Many described this as a 'masterpiece' and an 'extraordinary work of art' without clearly explaining why and without the use of adequate, specific examples that support their high ratings and adoration.Personally, I could not relate to the central character, to his vicious gang, or to any other of the movie's unlikable or weak personalities in any way. During the 'rehabilitation' phase of the movie, I could not understand what society or government, today or in the future, would elect to employ the methods that were used. The future world that was created, consisting of ugly, vulgar works of art and interior designs, abandoned theaters, perverse behavior, uncontrollable sex drive, constant physical abuse, disorder, neglect, filth, and general disrespect for anything and everything, was just too creepy for me to want to experience for even one hour, let alone two hours and seventeen minutes. Another major offense was the inappropriate use of Beethoven's magnificent music as it accompanies the most unpleasant visual images conceivable. It's too bad that deceased artists have no say as to how their works are used after they are gone, but who ever said that life was fair? I gave this movie a rating of four out of ten only because it did manage to produce a response of utter revulsion from within me, but I can't think of any other accomplishment. Not my cup of tea.",4,5,10,11 July 2016
Psycho," Not Just Any Mama's Boy
","I was eleven years old when 'Psycho' was first shown at theaters in 1960. My mother absolutely prohibited me from seeing it, so, naturally, I was soon headed by bus to the Ritz Theatre in downtown Elizabeth, New Jersey by myself so that there would be no witnesses. I was so shocked after the first half hour that I don't think that I had a clue as to what followed, even if I could understand it at the time, and I couldn't.From the opening pan shot of 1959 downtown Phoenix and the subsequent zoom into the intimate hotel room of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin), this movie never fails to maintain my interest even after many viewings over the past 57 years. It's just that good. No viewing, however, will ever have the same, terrifying impact of the first.As talented as Alfred Hitchcock is as a director, and this movie ranks among the best of his many brilliant works, I do not believe that 'Psycho' would have the same shocking effect without Bernard Hermann's extremely tense score, which consists solely of nerve-racking string instruments. In addition to the outstanding direction, musical score, and photography by John L. Russell, I thought that the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were exceptionally good. In the case of Leigh, I have followed her career from her earliest films of the late 1940's (The Romance of Rosy Ridge, Act of Violence, etc.), and I believe that this is among her best work. The handling of the resolution of Marion's inner conflict at a critical moment while she dines with Norman is especially effective, and her entire portrayal is Oscar worthy, even if she does only appear for less than thirty minutes. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his depiction of Norman Bates was so iconic that he could not easily be identified by audiences as anyone else. In his small but notable role, Frank Albertson as the fat cat who actually owned the $40,000 was quite memorable, and he seemed to relish his role as he flirted with Marion, a much younger woman. Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, as Marion's colleague at the real estate office was also very amusing, as she was in her father's 'Strangers on a Train'.The one major flaw for me, as well as for other reviewers here, is Simon Oakland's awkward monologue at the end, which I found not only unnecessary but harmful to the film as a whole. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still annoys me as a senior citizen today. Norman seated in the padded cell with the very creepy voice-over and the haunting, subtle superimposition over his image doesn't require Oakland's tedious explanation at all. What makes it even worse is the psychiatrist's odd gleefulness as he confirms Marion's horrible fate to Sam and Lila. As this is such an impressive film overall, I never allowed this awkward ending to ruin the rest of it for me.",9,0,1,7 January 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The Forest From the Trees
","Many of the most negative reviews about this film object to the alleged falsification of history by the creators. Although I was disappointed with this latest viewing of the movie, I don't agree with these reviewers. The film is a work of fiction that is loosely based on a true, historical event, and that is how it is to be viewed. I recently watched 'The Best Years of Our Lives', another film, much more to my liking, that is also centered on World War II but focused on an entirely different aspect of that war, the challenge that adjustment to civilian life poses to combat veterans in a world that is supposed to be peaceful but isn't. As in the case of this film, that product is a work of fiction based on true experience, but neither film was ever intended to be a factual documentary or a work of non-fiction. The actual combat disability of actor Harold Russell in 'Best Years of Our Lives' is very real, but he doesn't portray himself or his own, personal story in the movie. In this case, no one is denying that Allied prisoners were treated much more harshly by their Japanese captors than depicted here or implying that the real colonel, upon whom the story is based, collaborated with the enemy as the fictional Colonel Nicholson did.While the film opens with a very dramatic battle of wills between Colonel Saito and Lt. Colonel Nicholson and ends with an even more spectacular finale, I found very little action in between. Although the scenery of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the movie's actual location, is quite spectacular and the Siamese (Thai) women are very pleasant to behold, much of the dialogue is dull and even banal.Alec Guiness, who was very reluctant to take the role of Nicholson, creates an intriguing portrayal of the officer in charge of the Allied prisoners. Sessue Hayakawa is equally as good as his counterpart, the Japanese officer in charge of the prison camp. Many notable actors, including Charles Laughton, refused the role of Nicholson because they didn't understand his motivation, a view which should be appreciated. Others believed the material, based on that of a French author, to be viciously anti-British, which is also a reasonable interpretation. I was unimpressed by the rest of the cast, and I consider myself to be a fan of William Holden. His exchange with the bribed Japanese guard, for example, is nothing short of ridiculous. In general, Bill doesn't seem to be emotionally involved in the lame dialogue and may have even found some of it embarrassing.As a result of the commendable performances of both Guinness and Hayakawa, the beautiful cinematography by Jack Hildyard, the film's trademark whistling of 'Colonel Bogey's March', and an unforgettable ending that is worth the long wait, I rate it a 7 out of 10. I strongly disagree that fighting the Japanese and the Germans in the most effective way possible during World War II amounted to 'madness' as this film seemed to suggest at the end. That is just wrong.",7,1,1,29 November 2017
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Got the Burgundy Blues
","As much as I tried, I couldn't even make it through the first thirty minutes, and I can't recall that happening in a long, long time, so I don't know if it ever improved during the last hour. I doubt it. I admit that I rarely watch films produced in the twenty first century, and now I understand why. How did this total loser ever get a 7.2 rating from IMDb subscribers? The writing was inane and infantile. So was the pathetic attempt at comic acting. I have seen Steve Carrell in some funny roles, but this just wasn't one of them. This movie didn't make me laugh. It made me very sad. I don't know why I even punished myself by sitting through the first half hour. Shame on me.",1,4,6,4 October 2016
Paths of Glory," In War, Don't Expect Fairness
","Although 'Paths of Glory' certainly makes a powerful statement about the horror, misery, and insanity of war, specifically the hellish conditions of the World War I trenches, it addresses an even broader theme concerning the arrogant abuse of power by extremely flawed individuals who sometimes occupy positions of authority that control our very lives.The 'powers that be' demand that Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his men 'take the anthill no later than the day after tomorrow', and the generals don't want to hear any ands, if, or buts about it. From the response of Dax, who seems able and reasonable, and other officers on the ground, we soon realize that the order by the distant and detached generals is all but impossible under the current conditions on the battlefield. The generals have barked their commands but appear indifferent to the suicidal nature of the mission. They dine and dance in palatial magnificence far away from the difficult and inhuman conditions of the foul and filthy trenches and then break for a few minutes to plan for the sure slaughter of their own subordinates without the slightest concern for the impact of their decisions upon the very lives of other human beings.Filmed in stark black and white, Kubrick very ably recreates the maddening and terrifying conditions of the World War I trenches unlike any other film that I have ever seen. As Colonel Dax passes through his weary and injured troops, who line both sides of the narrow, fortified passages, a constant barrage of enemy explosions and whizzing missiles threatens them from all sides. What could Dax be thinking and feeling as he is about to lead his men beyond the trenches into an even worse hell of the open battlefield and toward the anthill beyond? We observe an undeniable look of terror in his face that is camouflaged by the strength and resolve that is required to lead in battle. To me, this sequence is one of those very special, unmatched moments in cinema, and, as to its intensity and complexity, who could deliver it better than Kirk Douglas?When the predictable outcome of the mission is reported to the distant generals, that is, as soon as they find a moment to break from their perpetual partying, imbibing, and gorging, they decide to hold responsible one individual from each of the three companies for the failure. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is selected by his cowardly, drunken lieutenant only because he witnessed the same superior officer killing a subordinate in order to escape from a dangerous assignment, therefore conveniently avoiding his own court martial trial. Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel) is selected merely at random from the drawing of lots. Private Fierol (Timothy Carey) is chosen only because his superior took a personal disliking to him as a 'social outcast'. 'Me a social outcast?' Fierol asks in outrage and disbelief. As in 'The Killing', Carey is a special kind of an actor who portrays his characters so realistically that you feel as though you've met them somewhere in your life, but you can't recall exactly when or where. Was it in high school gym class? Homeroom? Afterschool detention?As a perpetual, lifelong fan of 'Blackboard Jungle', produced two years earlier, I take special note of the drastic conversion by actor Emile Meyer from gruff vice principal Halloran ('Shaddap!') to the compassionate and totally appalled priest here. This guy could probably play anybody, and play him well.Rather than revealing the results of the trial, I'll skip to the final scene in which Dax's remaining troops are celebrating their fortuitous survival at a local bar. The proprietor introduces a very reluctant, captured German girl (played by Christina Kubrick, the director's wife!), who is forced to perform before the rowdy and raucous group. As she slowly begins her melancholy song, the camera shifts to the individual faces of some of the men who have suddenly quieted down as they listen to the music. The tune sung by the terrified, tearful girl somehow moves them to stop their noisy celebration and to focus instead on their own inner thoughts, perhaps of the lives they left behind or of their ability to survive the war. The men then start humming to the girl's nostalgic song as she finally succeeds in composing herself on stage. The camera then shifts to Colonel Dax who has paused in front of the bar to listen to the singing men, absorbed in his own most private thoughts. A sergeant arrives to tell Dax that his men must return to battle. 'Give the men a few more minutes,' replies Dax, fully aware of how very precious those moments are.",9,0,1,24 June 2019
From Here to Eternity," Trouble in Paradise--And It Only Gets Worse
","This is a film which still endures the test of time as it dramatically depicts the lives of a small circle of military personnel on the island of Oahu in Hawaii just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which suddenly plunged the United States into World War II. At the beginning, Sergeant Warden (Burt Lancaster) stands at Schofield Barracks before a wall calendar prominently displaying 'December 6, 1941'. As viewers we are immediately struck by the circumstances of people caught up with their everyday problems at the very moment when the Japanese are finalizing their surprising and devastating attack, the most serious strike on U.S. territory by a foreign government since the American revolution, right where these people are stationed.As much as I love Audrey Hepburn, I do not understand how she was able to beat Deborah Kerr's portrayal here for an Oscar in 'Roman Holiday', a film that failed to inspire me in any way whatsoever. That's show business. In its depth and strength, Kerr's performance here was as close to perfection as they get. Mix that with outstanding work by Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, and Donna Reed, as well as top notch direction and screenwriting, and you have the makings of a great film. Director Fred Zinnemann once remarked how the lead actors, particularly Clift, who was known as a perfectionist, established a very high standard for the entire cast. Frank Sinatra believed that this was not his greatest performance and confessed of his dependence upon Clift's valuable guidance in this picture.As good as the acting is, much of the overall credit goes to director Zinnemann for another superb product to add to all of the others, including 'High Noon', 'Man For All Seasons', 'The Search', 'Act of Violence', 'Oklahoma', 'Nun's Story', and 'Julia', just to name a few.I very much appreciate the film's location of pre-statehood Hawaii and observe how much of the movie seemed to be produced at that magical time in the evening before the sunset. 'It's the most beautiful place that I have ever seen,' observes Karen Holmes (Kerr) in the final scene, and I quite agree with her on that point. The darkened light and shadows convey a very special time at the end of Hawaii's day, enhancing its beauty in glorious black and white, which contributes authenticity to the 1941 atmosphere. These elements also suggest, somewhat ominously, the catastrophic event to come. Although James Jones, the original novelist, did not appreciate the final adaptation of his work, credit should go to screenwriter Daniel Taradash, who successfully condensed a very long book into two action packed hours while satisfying the censors and retaining much of the story's potency at the same time.",9,2,2,4 March 2018
