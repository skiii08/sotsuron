The Blair Witch Project," A must see...
","I was frozen to my seat.  My heart was beating fast and my eyes started to water.  Never has a movie gripped me, terrified me, drawn me in, and managed to make me laugh.  The acting was superb and was very realistic.  A few times I had to actually ask whether or not it was in fact real footage material.  I went to see it with 4 other people and afterwards we sat around anaylzing it and freaking each other out even more.  Two of us are going to see it again!  The best part of the movie is that it leaves a lot to your imagination and allows you to draw your own conclusions.  I am glad that I didn't read any message boards before I went to see it, I think that would have spoiled it slightly (especially if I had read the ending).  I hadn't seen any previews.  All that I knew was that 3 students mysteriously disappeared and a year later their film footage was discovered.  The funniest part is I actually stayed up later doing truth/or not research on the movie in order to get some sleep!!!  I'd rate it a 9 out of 10.",Null,1,2,18 August 1999
