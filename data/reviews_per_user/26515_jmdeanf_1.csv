The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," interesting, and quite prophetic
","The Double Life of Veronique is not Kieslowski's best, but it's an interesting piece of work.  The lighting is invariably beautiful, shot in sepia tones which mirror Tarkovsky.  Of greatest interest, though, is its influence on 'Amelie'.  The theme of a young girl drawn inexorably towards her destined lover, achieved through a series of bizarre, improbably (indeed, supernatural) events is present in both and there are similarities in appearance and personality between Irene Jacob here and Audrey Tautou in Amelie.Maybe this is far-fetched, but I also detected what might be a precursor to Spike Jonze's films (scripted by Charlie Kaufman).  'Being John Malkovich', along with 'The Double Life..' carries puppetry as a central analagous idea, both films featuring puppets of the main characters.  Also, the notion of one of the main characters writing the story of the film within the film (which we see in 'the Double Life...') is obviously the central premise of 'Adaptation'.'The Double Life of Veronique' is therefore definitely worth a look considering that 'Amelie', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' all seem to borrow heavily from it.",Null,3,5,3 May 2003
