It," Great movie. What horror aspires to.
","I have tagged with spoilers because I have read the book and watched the movies multiple times so I forget what can be spoiled. I love the book this is based on. I have read it 3 times all the way through and other times just to revisit the creepiest moments. It is truly a masterpiece, and to try and capture all of it in a movie is unthinkable. What this movie does well is it maintains the most important aspects of the original story and focuses on the friendship formed by the Losers. It cuts out the additional world-building that is in the book (I can't stress enough that is it a strong point of the book) and streamlined the tale to focus on the children rather than Derry as a whole. Cinematically, this is brilliant and well executed. A terrifying movie and well done. Jump scares are sparingly used, as it should be for a movie that does a good job of building a terrifying ambience. I can not recommend enough if you love horror!",9,1,1,28 October 2019
