Mission: Impossible III," very good
",i think that this mission impossible movie is the best out of all three because it has the most action. The reason i did not give it a ten is because i did not like how they show part of the end of the movie at the beginning that kinda gave it away. i really think that the scene in the vadicain wall ( the part were he is pretending to be a priest) was very cool i just thought that it was very interesting. I think that the movie was very unrealistic though because the part were they made the mask of Davine was fake just as the part were Ethan jumped off the building was unrealistic because he would definitely died. but my favourite part of the movie was the first part were Davine has Ethan's wife chained down and he is threatening to kill her that really got the old adrenaline going. overall though i really liked it.,9,0,2,7 May 2006
