The Hangover," If that's a hangover,i'll never get drunk again!
","I've seen a trailer for this movie when i went to see a Terminator 4 and i instantly liked it.However i still had a doubt that this movie will turn out to be something like 'What happens in Vegas' with Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz which is not a bad comedy but nothing special either,just an average movie.I must say that i'm glad that my doubt's did not come true.The Hangover is a great comedy.One of the best.It's as funny as it could be.It's even intelligent in some sort of weird way.Tod Phillip's has chosen a dream cast for this film.The cast is really excellent.And not only because the characters are great.Writing is excellent too.They've managed to write a comedy that at no point is a cliché and that at no point is predictable which is a great plus in my book.The only man who managed to do that in this genre in the last couple of year's is Judd Apatow.Too short the story this movie is great.A weird and perverse fat man,a fancy guy,a geek and a missing bachelor will make you laugh from beginning until the end.Go and see this movie!You wont regret it!!!",10,2,4,11 June 2009
In Bruges," Great.Excellent black humor comedy.
","I have to say that i wasn't expecting much from this movie.I thought it will be just another failor of making a good black humor comedy...However i was wrong.This movie is excellent.It's followed by pretty depressive atmosphere which gives even more humor into the movie.Especially when you find out why they've been sent in Bruges(old medieval city). Collin Farrell was great.His acting is great.He did an excellent portrait of depressive,i don't give a damn criminal.Brendan Gleeson is even better an Ralph Fiennes acted this role so strange that you cant recognize him.Good but strange. Anyway i wont write anything else,all i can say that you should watch this movie.If not for the cast than for the movie it self because it's great.Good directing,acting and screenplay are making this movie as good as it is.And it has one of the best endings ever. Enjoy!!!",10,6,10,10 January 2009
The Big Lebowski," Very intelligent on a dumb sort of way!!!
","This movie's just great! Jeff Bridges was brilliant and he definitely deserved an Oscar for The Dude! I'm usually a fan of Coen Brother's ever since they made their first movie, Blood Simple, and they haven't disappointed since! Sure they've made a couple of average movies but never a bad movie! Not so far, at least! John Goodman was also great if not the funniest character in this movie! His character is just brilliant! A guy that turned Jewish since he's married his wife who left him, always talking about Vietnam and about how he saw his friends with their faces in the mud even when they're talking about potatoes for instance, and so on... and so on... I can't find any mistakes in this film except that i would have really loved to see a bit more of Steve Buscemi! The script and the directing are also great as expected from Coen Brothers. Violence is just in line. Not overdone and not underdone. And the music is just brilliant!!!! This is a well packed, very well written mix of black comedy and a thriller that's way too intelligent to be dumb and way too dumb to be intelligent! A masterpiece!!!",10,0,2,17 June 2010
Star Trek," 97-th on 250 list!?Is this a joke?
","I went to see Star Trek the first day it came to cinemas and i can't say it was a bad movie but i can't say it was a good one either.There are so many sf movies that are much better than this one an that didn't get not even as close of attention that this one did.Star Trek is an average movie that could be a lot better and that's not even as close as good as the TV series.Screenplay is basically simple,direction is good an the acting is average.The best thing about the movie are special or should i say visual effect's.They are phenomenal.If you're asking me does this movie deserves all the attention it got i say no,if you ask me is it a bad movie i say no,if you ask me does it deserves to be on any list an not only IMDb's 250 list i most definitely say no!!! Star Trek is a highly overrated movie and there is no chance or way that it's better than Dances with wolves,Gladiator,Out of Africa,The Deer hunter,Braveheart,No country for old men,Sin City,Ben Hur,Platoon,Gandhi,Gone with the wind,Scarface,Manhattan,Mystic River and many,many others....Don't believe the rating's.This movie doesn't deserves to be on 5000 list an barely on 250 list!!! Just another average movie.Not bad but not good either!!!",6,6,11,23 June 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare In Love wins The Best Picture a.k.a 'You got to be kidding me'!
","Okay,here is the thing.There is no much to say about Shakespeare In Love.It's a delightful and sometimes funny and charming movie that you will enjoy watching but that you will forget in a year.This movie actually won The Best Picture Oscar against Saving Private Ryan.Give me a break,will ya?It's a good movie that has a few moment's and that's it.There is nothing special in it!A tons of movies like this one are made every year.If you want to watch a delightful movie that has humor in it then i recommend you As Good As It Gets.It's five times better.I can understand it won some Oscar's for it's technical aspects but to award this movie with the best screenplay Oscar when La Vita E Bella and Saving Private Ryan are it's competition is just sinful.It's a sin.Just as it is a sin to award it with Best Picture or The Best Actress In A Leading Role!!! Shakespeare in Love is a fine movie that is nice and relaxing to watch!But to call it a masterpiece is just 'Stupid'!!!!!!!!",7,0,0,14 April 2009
Oldboy," Even if you don't like it, you have to admit, it's One Of The Most Original Movies Ever!
","Stunned! Old Boy is one of the best and most ORIGINAL movies ever. Not in the last decade or two but ever. It's simply brilliant! And as i said in many of my other comments, Academy really sucks! Old Boy wasn't even nominated. It should have been nominated in , at least, these categories; Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Movie, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Leading Actor (Min-sik Choi). I didn't mention The Best Director because the competition was really good that year. At least in directing! An for the Best Foreign Language Film category, it definitely should have won in that one! This movie is something that you don't see every day. Sheer brilliance. Completely original, fresh, exciting, smart,... With one word, simply great! A pure masterpiece. This is a 'must see' for everyone. In my eyes, this movie instantly made it's way to my personal favorites. This is an instant classic! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!!And i just want to say that i'm really glad Steven Spielberg didn't decide to make an American remake after all! It would just ruin it. You can't make it better than it already is. Besides, i never really understood what's the point in making remakes of movies that are already good or great as this one in the original! My recommendation to absolutely everyone!!! SUPERB!!! CLASSIC!!!",10,1,6,15 May 2010
The Others," If not the best than definitely one of the best Horror movies ever made!
","This movie is brilliant! Combine SCARY with DRAMATIC and add some INTELLIGENCE to it and this is what you'll get! Simply amazing! 90% of the entire movie is happening in the house and i don't know how, but it's never boring. You're always expecting something that never happens. Brilliant! And i really liked how Alejandro Amenabar has tried and succeeded in adding a lot of drama to the movie. That really made the mood a lot better.I also really liked his directing. Almost the entire movie's been shot on dark places around the house with no light to it than the one of some candle or something. That candle or candles is what's, actually, giving you the chills when you hear voices or something in the movie. You always wonder what if the candle goes out.Nicole Kidman was brilliant. Ever since she started pumping her face with botox or whatever, even though she is a great actress, i just can't find any sort of emotion in her performances. But that's not the case with this one. This role demanded Nicole Kidman. She was just amazing. Sad, angry, calm, scary - all at once. This role really fits her. She freaked me out in this movie.I almost forgot to mention, the music is excellent! It really gives a lot to the movie! And the ending! The ending is perfect! More than perfect!!! It's what, in my eyes, made this movie one of the best horror's ever!!! Do not miss this movie! It's brilliant!!! This movie is the best that you can get out of a horror movie!!!! It's got everything! It's just great! Watch it and see for your self!!!",10,0,3,15 August 2010
Troy," I just had to write a comment on this film after i read some other comments!
","I watched this movie the first day it came to cinema.I expected it will be great...and i got what i expected.I just cant listen people who say that this is a bad movie only because its not made correctly by the Iliad and because its not epic enough.I mean come on people!What did you expect.Its not Ben hour or the gladiator but its a great half action half epic movie.I think that we should see more of this kind of movies.Its epic on its own personal way,not like Ben hour,gladiator,brave-heart,Spartacus,el Cid...Its epic like Troy.There is a lot of epic in this movie the only problem is that people think that what makes epic movie is that you have to cry enough tears to make an ocean at the end of the film.Well i gotta a news for those people...its not.An the fact that this film is not made correctly by the Iliad don't makes him worse.It only shows the vision of how would it be if it was of a person who wrote it.And by the way Braveheart had some historically inaccurately things in it but he turned out to be a great film.Troy has a million elements of what makes a good movie.Like for examples:1.Brad Pitt was great as Achilees. 2.Eric Bana was as good as it gets. 3.Peter O'Toole was great. 4.Direction was pretty good. 5.Production was perfect. 6.Visual effects were great. 7.Sound effects were great. 8.Battle choreography was one of the best in history of film making. 9.Dialog was magnificent. 10.Relationship between a king who needs a warrior which he hates and opposite is great.There are so many things in this film that are great which some people refuse to see only because they read Iliad or god knows what.This movie is a great filled with action,epic romance that you must see. I just have to give him ten because it don't has to be Ben-Hur to be a great epic movie. If you haven't watched it,watch it an if you have watched it,watch it again.",10,4,7,22 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," The worst movie i have ever watched
","When i was going to cinema to watch this movie even though everyone told me that its really bad i was very excited because i didn't expect a great movie anyway but i expected movie full of action,special effects...,a good fun anyway!But...i should of listened to my friends.This movie is probably the worst movie i have ever watched.The biggest potential in this movie are special effects but they are not often too see expect for the ones they used on spider-man.Where the hell is venom?I was most excited to see him anyway but unfortunately you can really see him only at the end of the movie(FOR COMFORTATION HE WAS MADE PREETY GOOD).Now the second problem!There is no excitement in this movie.There are only few action secvencens and even those are really short and boaring.If there is any movie that should be filled with action its this one but again unfortunately its not.Now the third problem!Tobey Maquire!An actor with a great potential but in this movie he used none of it.Perhaps its directors fault but all in one he is very irritating in this part of spider-man trilogy an especially when he becomes bad because of the venom's suit.That part of the movie i want even comment. Kirsten Dunst even i don't like so its pretty hard for me to say this was that one leg that held this tripod together.Now the fourth problem!Dialog,dialog,dialog!Dialog was between the top five worst dialogs ever.I don't get it,how can so expensive movie be this bad when it comes to that matter.The characters in this movie are really speaking things that have no sense.I could speak about why is this movie so bad the whole day but i really just want to forget about it. Anyway the movie had a potential but he turned out to be as bad as it could so if you want to sleep tight don't watch it.",1,2,4,25 May 2008
Yes Man," Not enough real Carrey in it.
","MAYBE ONE TINY SPOILER!I don't know is it about the directors or Jim but he is just not what he used to be. I mean the movie is really funny and its pretty good but it's not an old Carrey we used to watch. Like Ace Ventura for example where he does all kind of faces and stupidness. In the past couple of years his acting became kind of serious. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty good but his movies are just not as funny as they used to be. Even though there are some scenes in this film where he does the faces like for example when he get's drunk and fight's that big bold guy.Anyway the movie is very funny and i will watch it at least a couple more times but i'm giving it eight because there should be more Jimness in it. Don't miss it, go and see it. Enjoy.",8,2,3,10 January 2009
The Prestige," A good movie,maybe even great but still very overrated!
","Prestige is a great movie.Christopher Nolan once more proved him self to be a great director.The acting is also very good an the best thing about it is probably the screenplay.However this movie most definitely doesn't deserves to be on eighty third place on 250 best movies ever made list.There are probably a hundred to two hundred movies that are better than this one.How can Prestige be better then The Deer Hunter or The Gladiator or Braveheart or Dances With Wolves or Meet Joe Black which is one of the most underrated movies of all time.There are also 2001: A Space Odyssey,Once Upon a Time in America,Full Metal Jacket,The Sting,Sin City,The Green Mile,Ben-Hur,Gone with the Wind,Gandhi,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Mystic River,Good Will Hunting,Rocky and many,many other's.I can't really say anything bad about The Prestige except that it's overrated.Maybe it's not even overrated,i just think that there are definitely more than eighty movies that are better then this one.And even though it's a very intelligent,tensed and surprising movie that's not predictable,not one bit,i still think that it shouldn't be on the eighty third place! Sorry,i just don't! However,all i all,It's a good movie that you will surely enjoy watching.You will probably watch it more than once as i did.But still don't expect it to be the best movie you've ever seen cause it's definitely not.Enjoy!!!",8,1,2,28 March 2009
Shutter Island," A good movie with an ending that lacks some imagination.
","The movie alone is good. It's not great but it's good and well worth watching. The script is well structured and the story really draws you in. The characters are well placed and the entire course of the story development is nicely done and it definitely keeps your interest going all the way until the end. Unfortunately, the ending makes it way too usual and clichéd. We've seen it a hundred times before and obviously we'll see it a hundred times again. The movie would have been worth a lot more if the ending was done with a bit more imagination. I mean, really, what where they thinking? The entire movie is brilliant and than they ruin it just like that. Come on! As i said, it's seen a hundred times before and i really have no need to see it again.Martin Scorsese, contrary to everyones suspicion, again prooves him self as a director that can direct any genre and make it look good. I would dare to say that this is one of his best directed movies. Not one of his best movies but one of his best directed movies. He manages to keep the mood going and it really works with the audience. I also liked the lighting. It was brilliant. He achieved the great atmosphere with this one. That's really what i liked the most.Acting was good, though, i believe the star of this movie wasn't Leo DiCaprio but Ben Kingsley. I really enjoyed his creepy performance.All in all, this is a good movie that would have been great if the ending was different and more imaginative. But it's still, definitely, well worth watching.",7,1,3,22 July 2010
Armageddon," A propaganda movie i can't help but like! I feel guilty for it, but...
","I feel a bit disappointed in my self for liking this movie, since it's one of the biggest propaganda pictures of the last twenty years, but i just can't help it. It's a non stop action flick that puts a few A-listers and some best of the best B-listers in some very interesting situations happening in outer space.Directing and cinematography are music video like, as they always are in a Michael Bay movie, but music makes up for all of it. Aerosmith at it's best. Also, editing is quite good. The entire movie is well crafted and it's so hard not to like it weather you agree or disagree with some of the statements it presents. And writing, no matter how unoriginal it is, really takes the best from dumb science fiction movies and does a good job at putting it all together. Armaggedon is a big pile of overused Hollywood stuff, but the writer did a very good job with it and for that the movie is never boring or irritating in any way. And yeah, like i said, this is one of the biggest American Propaganda films of the last twenty years, but with all it's qualities i just can't help but love it. Even if those qualities are nowhere near to being original or fresh.As for the acting, the actors do quite good with their roles. Yes, even Ben Afleck. But the star of the film is still, as he is in any movie he's ever been in, Bruce Willis. He just looks natural in these bad guy with a heart of gold kind of roles. All the others did quite good as well, but like i said, Bruce really stands out. Even in a cast that's filled with good and popular names.American propaganda, yes! American propaganda at it's best, yes! I love it even though i hate all it stands for. Well, not all of it, but... I have nothing against patriotism, but i do have everything against movies that put one nation, America, in the savior of the world part and put it above everyone else. But i guess they tried to cover it up with a good hearted crazy Russian guy so i'll be forgiving this time and just enjoy the movie as interesting as it is, no matter what it's flaws are. And yes, you heard me right, the Russian guy is actually a good guy instead of a terrorist or anything like it. And he wants to come back to his Mother Russia as a hero! :)",8,3,4,4 October 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Ten is only because it's a HP movie. I had a lot of fun but....
","First i wanna say that this is not the best Harry Potter and that the only reason i gave it ten is because it's a Harry Potter movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a whole lot of fun and also the most faithful adaptation so far. Unfortunately, that's the problem right there. I'm not sure it was such a good idea to make two movies out of it. They found a part in the book that could be suitable as an ending and they decided to make two movies instead of one. That way they make more money and that way they stay more faithful to the material. However, that part they found good as an ending didn't work well as one. I would say that the only person to blame for this is David Yates. Even though i usually like him as a HP director and i appreciate and am very found of that dark tone that he brought to the series, with this one he made a big mistake. The final 'fight' scene was way too short and way too simple to be a 'final fight' scene. The entire movie would have been a lot better if it was made a bit differently. All needed to be done was to make it a bit slower, and by doing so longer, and a bit more with an attitude, so to say. The entire movie, because of it, really left a hollow impression. Either you read the books or not, you can just tell that it's not finished-that there's something missing.--- Another thing i was disappointed with was Raplh Fiennes. I usually think he's brilliant as Voldemort, but in this movie he was way too silent and he wasn't imposing his character enough. I just didn't see that Voldemort's scary leadership in this movie as i did in HP 4 and 5. I don't know, once again, he was just too silent and unimposing to leave any sort of scary impression on me. --- All in all, the movie was good and i had a lot of fun, but it think it would have worked a lot better with a bit more attitude.",10,1,4,19 November 2010
Doctor Zhivago," Worth of all the attention it got and more! A true classic!
","A month ago I've seen Doctor Zhivago for the first time after around ten year's. And i think now just as i thought before, it's simply brilliant! Dr.Zhivago is a great, epic movie. One of the best. And it's shameful academy didn't award it with best picture Oscar. I don't know what they were thinking because it totally deserved it.I usually like Omar Sharif. I find him like a peoples person. Somehow he adjusts to the audience an that's a big quality if you ask me.I also like Julie Christie. I think she is one of the most beautiful actresses that ever lived. I don't know, i just think she kind of blind's in into every single scene. She is the best part of this movie. Not only her as an actress but her character as well. And she definitely deserved to, at least, be nominated for the best actress.This movie is my recommendation to everyone. At my opinion, this is a movie that can't be hated. It's simply perfect. Well made in every aspect. Directing, acting, writing, CINEMATOGRAPHY!!!...Watch it under any cost and rate it with ten under any cost because it deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list and every other ''movie list'' there is!!!",10,1,2,1 April 2009
Pearl Harbor," Disappointed expectations!
","Pearl Harbor is a disappointment.I mean come on.The entire movie should of been sad and tragic story about two friend's and their unbreakable friendship.But it wasn't.It was planed to be but it wasn't.Rafe McCawley who is played by Ben Affleck and Danny Walker who is played by Josh Hartnett are two best friend's that dreamed to be in the air-force for their entire life's and when it comes true it all goes to hell.They start complaining about everything and they fight and argue about anything.Evelyn Johnson who is played by beautiful Kate Beckinsale is the worst character in the entire movie.She first hook's up with Rafe McCawley who she loves more then her self.Then Rafe goes to war and his plane is being crashed which hurt's her so much that she sleep's with his best friend Danny Walker who gave his best to comfort her.I mean...He was Rafe's best friend for his entire life and then he get's over his death in like two day's.Anyway he fall's in love with Evelyn and everything is perfect until suddenly Rafe comes back.What am i supposed to cry on this.It's so typical American war heroes story except there were much better ones.Evelyn is supposed to look like a virgin Mary in this movie an she end's up to be like some girl from Red Light District. Relationship between Rafe and Evelyn and Danny and Evelyn should have been more described and better realized.Then the movie could worth something.Like this it all happen's too fast and all the character's look like some moron's. The movie wasn't directed badly as written badly which is quiet surprising since the screenplay was written by Randall Wallace.Where are the Japanies in this story.They look like nothing but a terrorist's.They had innocent's dying too but in this movie only American's have lost their loved ones.This is supposed to be something like Flag's Of Our Father's and Letter's From Iwo Jima,then it would be worth of something.Like this it's nothing but a wasted three hour epic story with some fun in it. All the acting talent was wasted in this movie.It's worth watching it just too see how epic movies can turn bad.It has some fun in it but there are better way's to waste three hour's of your life.",7,0,1,22 September 2008
Tropic Thunder," My opinion on the movie and all those 'Communities' complaining about it!
","Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies ever!Period.I have to admit that i had a very high expectation's for this movie since some of my very,likable actor's are acting in it!Such as Nick Nolte,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,Robert Downey...Oh yeah,Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey too!Just take a look at the cast.Would those actor's really acted in some movie if they'd thought it's not worth it?I don't think so!The cast alone tell's you how good movie this is! I must say that i was really surprised by Robert Downey.If there weren't Heath Ledger,he would of won the Oscar.This is Robert Downey's best role so far.He was even better then in Chaplin.He acted this role better then Denzel Washington him self,would of! Nick Nolte was also great.As alway's of course an i want even speak of Tom Cruise,who was truly excellent.Too short the story,everyone was great! Another thing that's great,maybe even Oscar nomination worthy,is direction.Ben Stiller really did it this time.He really outmatched him self.I must say that this is not the kind of movie everyone will like.This is a kind of an intelligent comedy.Don't get me wrong,i'm not trying to disrespect anyone or say that i liked it because i'm smart or something,it's just that some people want comedies too be simple.To be something like the way to relax their mind for an hour or two.Now,i've noticed that some black communities were protesting about Robert Downey playing a black man.That is a white man playing a black man.Well i think that those communities are overreacting and that those communities are insulting their selves.What Ben Stiller tried to do by writing such a role where the white man is playing a black man is to make fun of Hollywood.To show how stupid Hollywood really is.I mean come on...Would you really be surprised if one day in some drama movie,a white man would actually be playing a black man.I sure wouldn't.That's Hollywood.A kind of a sick world in which nothing can really surprise you.I also noticed that some war veteran's were protesting about how this movie is making fun of them.Well i must say 'wrong' again.It's not making fun of patriot's or anything like that,it's just making fun of all the people who make money by making a war movies and saying that they don't make them for the money but because they are patriot's.Like a tribute to the country.Well that's bullsh_t!Most of those guy's who make those movies haven't seen war.Not a piece of it.Most of them weren't even alive at the time.I mean,OK,maybe Oliver Stone.But don't think he's making those movies because of the patriotism either.I'm not trying to judge some people with this comment or anything like that.Frankly,i don't give a damn since i'm not American but what i'm trying to say is that there are alway's some communities complaining about some movies in America.To those communities,no matter which,gay,black or veteran or any other communities,i just want to say that they should finally understand the fact that those are only movies.No point in complaining about 'em when they're gonna be made anyway! Just one more thing.I've noticed that some people were complaining that this movie is insulting mentally challenged people.Well,once more 'totally wrong'!This movie is just showing how in Hollywood every second actor built's his career and win's Oscar's for those role's.I mean let's face it.Almost every actor who portrayed mentally challenged person won an Oscar or at least was nominated.Toma Hank's,Dustin Hoffman, and so on...Even Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for portraying Christie Brown,who wasn't mentally challenged but sick.However he looked like he was mentally challenged.That brought him an Oscar.And he deserved it,definitely,just as both of those actor's i just wrote.But that's not the thing.The thing is that they haven't portrayed those roles out of charity but because of their own benefit.-----And that's just what this movie tries to show us,how really sanctimonious Hollywood is!----- Anyway,to end with my comment.Tropic Thunder is a smart and brilliant movie that shouldn't be taken to easily.It's a movie that's very funny but still not just another comedy! I definitely recommend it!",10,3,7,27 March 2009
District 9," Fresh and original.A real surprise!
","As soon as i've seen the high rating's on IMDb's 250 list and after i read some comment's about how good this movie is,i instantly concluded that this will be just another overrated garbage such as Star Trek!But luckily i was wrong.This movie is great.Great, original idea turned into a good script and brilliant directing are making District 9 as good as it is.Among all thing's that are great in this movies such as visual's,direction,battle choreography and many other's,i must say i was quite surprised that acting didn't suck.I mean it wasn't something brilliant but still pretty good.The only noticeable mistake i could find in this film is the ending.There are two mistakes about the it.1.More should have been explained about the leading character.Neill Blomkamp probably tried to make Wikus a bit more mysterious but when you're doing that you have to make the character's personality that way,which at my opinion he failed.2.The last fourthy five minutes are nothing then bang,bang.And even though the action is made brilliantly,that just ruin's it for me.The entire movie was very serious and realistic considering what it's about,then why turn it into an action flick in the end.Conclusion:Even though it could be better,it's still good and interesting movie who's story is surprisingly original considering the fact that in the last ten year's there were only two or three movies with original story.If you like good sci fi action flick with little more to it, then this is your kind of movie.",9,0,1,26 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia here we fail again...!
","First i must say that i didn't expect much from this movie in the first place.I thought it's just another piece of crap that comes from Hollywood and makes a lot of noise for nothing!And i was right!!! Mamma Mia is nothing more but an overrated cliché that has nothing to offer except a few nice shot's of a sunny beaches and a few very good actor's which ruin their own reputation by acting in a bad movie like this one.I can't believe Meryll Streep acted in this movie.By doing that she spat in her own face or should i say on her own wonderful carrier.The same thing i can say for Pierce Brosnan and a few more actor's.This movie is very,very irritating because there is no originality in it.Not one bit.I wont even speak of how predictable it is.I knew the entire movie at the very beginning.I am not planing on writing a story about it here because i don't think it's worth it.I mean i can't say it's not watchable,it's just that it's definitely not worth of attention it got or the money it earned.It's nothing more than nicely packed Hollywood piece of crap.Mamma Mia is definitely not my recommendation for anyone.Not even for Abba fan's.All they can see or should i say hear in this movie is Pierce Brosnan and the crew ruining some classic song's of Abba.Do not watch it!Avoid it!There are better way's to spend your free time.Much better way's.If you like musical's go and watch Moulin Rouge,Sweeney Todd or The West Side Story or Singing in The Rain because Mamma Mia is a pure waist of time!!!",3,4,8,18 March 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An outstanding piece of art!
","This movie is amazing.It radiates with excellent performances and it's own unique geniousity.There is no flaw in this movie.The screenplay is great,acting is great,direction is great,acting is great,production is great,....I really can't find the flaw in it.All i can think of writing is what's good in it so i'll just say what's the best thing in my opinion...It's character developing.The character developing is masterfully written in screenplay and masterfully portraited by actor's,especially by Brad Pitt and Casey Afleck!The entire movie actually follow's the story of Robert Ford and his fear respectful obsession with Jesse James.Now as we can see at the beginning of the movie it's clearly that Jese is his personal hero.He believes that Jese is the best gunfighter ever and that frightens him since he asumes that Jese is gonna kill him and the rest of the gang so they couldn't turn him in.The same opinion the other's share.Anyway,Jesse takes him under his wing and that's when the real trouble start's because pretty soon Jesse start's to believe that they might try to kill him even though he still hold's on to his cold blooded look.To short the story...This movie is not a regular western movie like bam,bam everyones dead.No,this is as i already said a piece of art.Which means that it goes really,really slow.It's mostly based on the mental condition of Robert and the rest of the gang since they assume that the best gunman ever is planing on killing them.They start to panic,they can't sleep,they always threat each other's,...and so on....Another great thing is that you don't really know,until the end is Jesse really trying to kill them all or not.That's one of the many thing's that will keep you on the chair through this movie.I watched this movie for like thousand times already and it's a masterpiece if you ask me.However it's not for everyone.Just like There Will Be Blood for example.It's the same kind of movie.If you like one of them,you like both of them.Anyway to end with my comment on this movie i will just say that i think that it's a movie that has to be watched,if not for the movie it self then because of the cast!Enjoy!!!",10,2,4,12 January 2009
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best directed movies ever!
","I cant believe this movie didn't get the Best Picture Oscar.It's ten times better then Shakespeare in Love.I wont even mention that it's one of the best directed movies ever.The direction is simply perfect.Even though i don't usually like Steven Spielberg because he direct's a lot of science fiction movies but a got to give it to the man,he really can direct.I think he should hold on to the themes like this one.You know,World War-II and so...Every movie he made on World War-II is a masterpiece.Just look at Schindler's List for example!It's a masterpiece too.Just like Saving Private Ryan.This movie has the most realistic war scenes ever.The camera is shaky all the time and it fit's great to the movie.The battles are so...Wow!Really great.A truly remarkable directing Spielberg did.Remarkable!I think you have to be a very skilled director to make an extraordinary epic movie out from a screenplay that's written in ninety present action.Don't get me wrong,the screenplay is great too but the director is mostly responsible for this movie turning out to be so good.I also have to mention that the acting was very good too.I was mostly surprised by Giovanni Ribisi.He truly acted great in this film.Afcorse there was also Tom Hanks who is alway's great and so on...There is only one thing that i didn't like in the movie and that's the end of it.Not the complete ending but the part when they find Ryan and when they tell him that his brother's are dead!I don't know,his reaction was just too normal.I mean i would be thinking about a suicide an he barely cried!!!But what a hell,the movie is still excellent.Anyway,this is a movie that i recommend to everyone.It's great in every aspect.Just turn it on and as soon as you see the first war scene on that beach,you will be amazed!A-m-a-z-e-d!!!10/10.",10,1,2,8 March 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Very good but....
","I watched this movie for the first time maybe three year's ago and i liked it.Peter O'Toole was great,Omar Sharif was great,Anthony Quinn was great,Alec Guinness was great...Everyone acted great.Especially Omar Sharif if you ask me.The movie is a great epic adventure,there is no doubt about it.It's just that i thought it was far too long.Especially the part when they're going through that desert through which no one ever went through and survived.That part was way too long.For twenty minutes we see Lawrence and the rest riding through the desert,not saying a word.It's just too long.Even though it's a really good movie i still think it could be better.And the obvious reason i think that is that at my opinion it could be shorter for thirty to forty five minutes.Maybe even more.But don't take this comment on a wrong way.It's still a great movie that's definitely worth watching.Direction,production,acting,cinematography and some other thing's are making it as good as it is.I just think it could be a bit better!If it was shorter i would definitely gave it ten but like this it's eight!",8,0,5,13 February 2009
The Lives of Others," A perfect writing and a brilliant movie!
","This movie wasn't even nominated for Best Picture or The Best Screenplay! Are you fuc*ing kidding me? This is one of the best movies ever to be made! I guess the Academy think's that a Foreign Language movie can't be better than the American movie! And this is not the first time they made such a mistake! I could count at least a hundred movies through-out the history that deserved at least to be Best Picture nominated! The Lives Of Other's is a cinematic masterpiece! Perfectly well written, directed great, acted great,... It's impossible for me to explain how good i think this movie is! Simply outstanding!Watch it under any cost! And give your best to find and read a script because it's one of the best screenplay's you're ever gonna read!!! Simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !-!-!",10,4,5,18 June 2010
Schindler's List," Best portrayal of death camps ever! A lot of credit to the producer Branko Lustig for it, who was an Auschwitz survivor!
","All the people say about it is true! Schindler's List is simply remarkable! No other movie has never shown the horrific thing's that the people in death camps, including not only Jew's but everyone, were witnesses and part of every single day! Very well done! And i give a big credit for it to a producer, BRANKO LUSTIG, who was an AUSCHWITZ surviver when he was a little kid. I'm sure, as Spielberg sais, that he had a big influence on this movie.------------------------- The directing is amazingly beautiful and this is one of the best directed movies ever. I like how it was shot in black and white. It gave a lot of dept to certain scenes and the whole movie. I especially liked the certain part's such as the one when we see a little girl in red coat in the distance and everything except her coat is in black and white. That was a beautiful scene. It really seals in your memory! As does the other part when we see the little girl in the red coat. I also liked the part at which a couple of Jews are praying around the candle and everything except for the fire of the candle is in black and white! Such a great scene! You can really sympathize with them! -------------------------- Writing is just great! The best part about it is characterization! I like the way Schindler was shown. How he was nothing but an idiot in the beginning and didn't care about anything or anyone except for his own pocket which he later on completely emptied in order to save the lives of his workers which were brutally killed every single day. I especially loved the character of AMON GOETH! What a great portrayal of a sick and evil man that's even kinda charming at times. I really loved his character. Simply perfect! It belong's to the movie history. As does the entire movie! And Ralph Fiennes was excellent! Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley were also great. Though, Ralph steals the show here!!! ---------------------------Another thing i must mention is music! John Williams composed something beautiful! I'm usually a big fan of Rock'n'Roll but i just can't stop listening to this song or a score, whatever it is! It's really beautiful and i'm sure it will be remembered and listened in two hundred year's from now because it's just outstanding!!! The violin sound's like it's crying! Beautiful!!!! ---------------------------- A perfect movie that deserves to be remembered and that, i'm sure, will be remembered just as the event's it show's and all the people that been through 'em! WATCH IT UNDER ANY COST!!!! SIMPLY GREAT!!!!",10,9,13,19 June 2010
The Mist," The ending is 90% of the movie!
","Mist is a fine movie.Frank Darabont is a good director,Stephen King is a good writer.So when those two come together you expect something extraordinary.And even though i can't say they delivered something extraordinary,i can say that they delivered something pretty good.The movie is followed by more or less a usual story.Alien's and all...That,i think is it's main flaw.The flaw that makes it only good.It has nothing new to show us.We've already seen alien's.However,the ending of this movie is just perfect.One of the best ending's in the history.The movie is not bad generally but the ending of it is,i ensure you,literally,90% of the movie.It's just so perfect that it makes you wanna watch it again and again and again! Stephen King is a great writer so i expected a bit more complicating story from him.However the story is too simple for movie to be great.One more thing that wasn't very good in this movie is Thomas Jane's acting.He was just...Not very good! The only reason i rated this movie with eight is it's ending.So i recommend you to watch it because it's ending is something you just have to see!!!!!!!",8,1,4,31 March 2009
Kick-Ass," If your 'instincts' tell you not to go see it - 'Don't Listen To 'em'!!! Kick Ass is not a masterpiece - it's The Masterpiece!!!
","I still can't believe how much a movie can surprise you! Even though a fear was present that it will turn out to be something unfunny like Hancock, which i'm glad it didn't, i still expected and hoped it will be great! Well... It's not! IT'S BRILLIANT! More than brilliant! Original,fresh and extremely funny and entertaining in every single aspect! This is not just a movie you'll like seeing, this is a movie you'll like seeing again and again and again...Considering what i wrote above, i really don't think i should write anything about how good directing, acting, writing and even Nicholas Cage, are!!! Not to mention that HIT GIRL is the best, the most original, the most dangerous and the funniest kid character even to be seen on movies. If it was me, i'd give Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl) an Oscar for this role. Magnificent!Kick as is a bloody, and literally 'a bloody', classic!!! If there is an ideal action movie, or an ideal comedy movie, or both of those together - THIS IS IT!!! Go see it before they raise the price on ticket's, which they would, could and should do considering what you're getting with this movie!!! I can't explain how surprised i am with this movie!!KICK ASS KICKS ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,3,12,15 April 2010
Meet Joe Black," One of the best movies i've ever seen!
","This is shameful.Meet Joe Black is not on IMDb's 250 list,you have got to be kidding me.This is one of the best movie ever an it's rated with 6.8.I can't believe this.It wasn't even nominated by the Academy.This movie is a proof that Oscar's mean nothing!Just as IMDb's ratings.Does anyone actually believes that Batman Begins or Kill Bill are better movies than this one?!I mean those are good movies,great movies but they're not even close to this one.Meet Joe Black is a well directed,brilliantly acted and perfectly well adapted movie which is just one more movie in the row that deserves to be called a classic but isn't.If you think i overreacted with bragging this movie,that may be true,but i just can't see why someone wouldn't like this movie.Meet Joe Black is most definitely my recommendation to everyone who did not see it and to everyone who did see it.At my opinion,this movie is a masterpiece!!!",10,5,7,12 June 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great even though could be excellent if the 'Ending' was different !!!
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie,not only because i'm a fan of Brad Pitt but because i thought the story is great.I can't really say that i was disappointed by the movie but i expected it to be a little bit better.At least the ending.Ending ruined the whole movie for me.It was really an excellent movie until the end.The ending is really far too long and far too stupid.I mean,OK i get it.The entire movie is about how he goes younger and all but i expected an ending to be a little bit more surprising and shorter or sudden.I don't know,perhaps i'm wrong but i think that they should of killed Benjamin when he was looking like he was twenty or something because it's just stupid that someone disappears.At my opinion he was supposed to die in an accident or anything but naturally.That is if you can call the way he died naturally.And if they would of killed him while he was looking like twenty the movie would definitely be more memorable.Everyone would be asking their selves what would of happened if he didn't get killed in that accident or whatever.And it would give a bit more mystic in the movie.Anyway the movie is very well directed and acted and the story is great.But i just can't explain how much i think that movie would be better with the different ending.If the ending was different i would give it ten but like this i give it eight.Watch it and enjoy.",8,1,2,9 February 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Some thing's i can't understand!
","Okay,i don't get it.How come that Kill Bill is on IMDb's 250 list an Dances with wolves or Legend's of the fall are not.It just don't makes any sense.I think Kill Bill is a great action movie.It has a large amount of fun followed by good directing,production,choreography and dialog but it just can't be as good as Dances with wolves is.It's far from it actually.Or let's say Gandhi.Gandhi is on 165'th place on 250 list an Kill Bill is on 136'th!It's just not possible.I mean it obviously is but Gandhi is a real masterpiece an it has a lower rating than Kill Bill.I can't say that Kill Bill don't deserves this place or this rating in his genre but comparing to Gandhi or Dances with wolves or Legend's of the fall it's nothing but a piece of crap.Some people will say that i don't like Tarantino because i wrote this but actually it's absolutely opposite.I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino.I really like his movies.Especially the older ones such as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir dog's.Those were the real masterpieces but Kill Bill...You can call it a masterpiece if you want but i can't believe that his rating is higher then rating's of the movies i mentioned earlier.Especially than the one i didn't mention an that's The Deer Hunter...Or for example Ben hur,Gone with the wind,Manhattan,Mystic river,Barry Lyndon,Doctor Zhivago,Life as a house,Meet Joe Black,Seven year's in Tibet and so on...and so on...Kill Bill is a movie that guarantees you'll have fun watching it.There is no doubt about it.But comparing to some other movies it don't deserves rating this big.That's why i think that IMDb's 250 list is a bit idiotic.You can't put Drama and kill everyone you can see kind of movie on the same list.You just can't! Anyway it's a fun movie and you should watch and enjoy but don't expect anything more than fun!!!",9,0,1,25 January 2009
Saw II," What's wrong with the world when so many people pay money to see movies about torturing other people for no reason?!
","The original Saw was OK. It had more or less an original premise at the time and it actually focused on at least some story and not only violence. Saw 2 on the other hand is just terrible. Bad acting, bad idea, bad script, bad directing and w whole lot of blood for nothing. Who would pay to see this c-r-a-p? I can't believe i payed to see it. Okay, i paid for the different reasons. I've seen all the Saw movies, not in theaters, and every last one of them sucks. Except for the first one that's at least watchable. The reason i've seen them is because i don't like to criticize something i don't know anything about and because so many people seems to like them. Which is just another proof of where the society is going when people are ready to pay their hard earned money to see movies about people being tortured by some psycho that the writers give their best to show him as some sort of a 'ocassionaly makes sense' kinda guy! Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against violence in movies. But i don't see why so many people want to see a movie that's about nothing but violence. Braveheart, The Deer Hunter, Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, even Kick Ass... Those are all violent movies. Some of them don't even have a message that speaks against it! And i don't mind that. I am not searching for a message when i'm watching a movie. I'm searching for a good movie. But Saw is a movie with only one storyline-violence. That's what i don't like about it. It's about nothing but violence! The worst thing is that they made a whole money making series on it. That's something i will never understand! Violence is OK - movies that hurt peoples intelligence are not. This kind of movie belongs to that group. And how in the world did it succeed to make that many fans??? I guess i'll never know!? Hostel, for instance, at least has some story. Saw is just terrible! ONE OF THE WORST SERIES EVER TO BE CREATED!!!!",1,3,5,15 November 2010
The Dark Knight," Brilliant but doesn't deserves the rating it got!
","If you ask me Batman is and always has been one of the greatest comic books.But what about the movies.Was it one the greatest movies based on a comic book?Now i can say for sure,yes!!!Forget about Spider-man,Superman,Hulk,Flash,X-men and so on...You have The Dark Knight now.I've waited for this movie so long that i almost had a heart attack and i must say it was more than worth it.This movie has everything.Excellent background,production,direction,music,visual effects,atmosphere,dialog,fighting sequences or choreography and above all acting.Heath Ledger was brilliant.He was so good i ask my self Nicholson who.Jack Nicholson had only one thing when he was playing Joker...an extraordinary acting gift.But Heath Ledger had it all for this role.Style,gift,sensuality,looks,...everything you can name and more.Even though i think that Nicholson is much better actor then he is,i must admit that when it comes to this role,there is no doubt that Heath is superb.He really was the main leg of the tripod in this movie.In fact all i wanted to see in this movie is him...The Joker! I also must say that Christopher Nolan made a great thing as a director and exspecially as a screenwriter.He showed us how would the real,not materialistic,psychedelic criminal mind looked like.Like in the scene when the mafia gives all that money to the Joker an he burn's it.Really amazing work. Enough about the Joker because i could write a book about him.Now...the bad thing's in this movie.I can name only three of them!An those are: 1.Harvey Dent was the most honest,the best person through this entire movie and that's why i ask my self...How could he become almost the worst one in around two minutes of talking to Joker.I think that Christopher Nolan should of put some more work on building his character.If i was the director,i wouldn't kill him on this part of Batman but i would make another part about Harvey Dent and about how he turned bad which for sure wouldn't be out of the blue sky! 2.Harvey Dent again.I can't really say that his face was made badly but i would of tried to make it more realistic.I mean in reality his eye would of felt out,his mouth wouldn't look like that in fifteen second's of burning and so on...but this is a movie based on a comic book after all so...i could be wrong! 3.Maggie Gyllenhaal!This is a Batman movie.I thought his girl or what ever she is should be as pretty as she possibly could be an they find probably the ugliest actress they could to act Rachel Daws!Honestly i was praying that she get's killed.I was hoping Batman won't catch her when The Joker droped her out through the window.Even though i think that The Dark Knight definitely doesn't deserves such a high place on 250 list,it's still an excellent movie.And it's suitable for everyone.It has drama,action,mystery,thriller,horror and even some black humor comedy in it so it's definitely one of the best if not the best movie in 2008!!! Enjoy!",10,5,11,30 July 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Theatrical Version -- Average! Director's Version -- Perfect!
","Once Upon A Time In America is, as Leone hoped it will be, his best movie! It's perfect! Many of you might wonder why this movie wasn't present at the ACADEMY AWARD'S. It's because of the producer's and Warner Bros, who ordered Leone to cut more than one hour of the movie for it's theatrical(original) release. It really ruins the movie. My most honest recommendation is that you see the ''director's version''! That version of the movie is simply magnificent! The director's version is the biggest rival The Godfather has and will ever have! It's simply perfect! True, it is long! But the movie is so good that the time will just fly! Trust me! I've seen it more than ten times and i'm still not bored. It's simply perfect! Not that the theatrical version isn't good, it's just that it's not even as close as good as the director's cut! And literally, not as close as good!!! It takes away the movies structure and leaves a lot of holes in the script! It ruin's it! It's still good, but it's no longer brilliant! I don't think it's necessary to say anything about acting! Just look at the cast!This movie is for everyone out there. This movie is a brutally honest story of a couple of friend's growing up together in a society that gives 'em no other choice but to become gangster's. Also there is a beautifully written love story in the background which comes to most unexpected twist. And i have to mention characterization! It's flawless! Simply perfect! -- Just as the entire movie is in the director's version!",10,6,10,11 May 2010
Avatar," Very 'influenced' and filled with 'cliches' but still a great movie with the best visuals ever seen!!!
","I must say that even though i really wanted to watch this movie,i still expected it to suck!I think that in these days,big budget movies are usually being eaten by great visuals.By that i mean that visuals oftenly distract you from holes in the script.And i can't say that,that's not the question with this movie too.Avatar is definitely not a movie that shows us something new in the way of storytelling or even the general idea!It's pretty obvious that it's been highly influenced by such movies as Dances With Wolves!To be completely honest,the only thing that's flawless in this movie are visuals!And they are so,so great.Especially in 3-D.But still,i really can't find a reason that would make me hate this movie.Maybe that's because i didn't expect it to be as good as James Cameron said it will be,i don't know.Avatar is a very interesting and tense movie with a predictable plot and bad character development!And even though i gave it nine,i still must admit that it DOESN'T DESERVE IT.At least not for what was said it will be because if you judge it by that,you will definitely be disappointed.It's a classic story with a classic ending and everything else except for the revolutionary visuals!But it's still very,very enjoyable to watch.And even though the characters were very shallow in a way that they're not complexed enough or maybe even at all,they're still quiet lovely and interesting and you will definitely care for them.Just as for the entire Na'vi civilization which is pretty well described in the movie but also obviously influenced by the native Americans or should i say indians!I can find a large number of mistakes that this movie has.I can also name at least ten movies that obviously influenced James Cameron to make this one.But i wont.Instead i'm just gonna take it for what it is and enjoy it's thousand times already seen but still beautiful story!This movie is definitely my recommendation to everyone.Just don't expect it to be what James Cameron said it will be because you might and probably will be disappointed.Except for the visuals!",9,5,11,17 December 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Influenced on many film makers today!A masterpiece!
","What to say about Clockwork Orange?There isn't really so much to say because it's reputation speak's for it self.And i can say that it's justified on that matter.This movie is just great.It's excellent.Direction and production are at maximum in this film.I wont even speak about acting.Malcolm McDowell portrayed one of the most sealed character's in the history of movies in this film.If you watch new Batman,The Dark Knight you can clearly see that Heath,even though his acting was superb,based his way of acting The Joker on Malcolm McDowell's Alex.Don't get me wrong,i'm not saying that McDowell acted Alex better then Heath Ledger did the Joker,he probably didn't but Alex from Clockwork orange is a cult character.McDowell had no one to look by when he was acting in this movie while Heath did.Even though he looked after McDowell,it don't means that it made it easier for him.It just helped him in the way of imagination because he didn't have to figure out the entire character's behavior for him self.Enough about McDowell and his character,let's talk about Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick is one of the best,most admirable director's ever.Not only that he made one masterpiece but he made them plenty.Too bad he died,i'm sure he had many more trick's in his hat to show which would come in handy to the other director's and entire Hollywood.He was a true master.There are classic movies and there are classic figures of film makers.He is between those on the top.There is nothing bad in his movies.For example...If you take a look at his other movies an especially Full Metal Jacket you will see that no matter what the story is,he never takes the political sides.His movies and him self are independent!!!Period!!!That's why his movies are for everyone.No matter are you English,Scotish,Irish,American,Russian,French,Croatian,Serbian or anyone else,his movies will not insult your nation's history in any way.I wont say anything else except that Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece that will be loved through generation's.A work of a master director.Watch it under any price.No matter what anyone says he/she can't explain the originality and brilliance of this movie.No word's can't!An if someone says to you that it's a bad movie,don't listen to him because he is lying!!!!!!!!!",10,1,3,28 January 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," A highly entertaining visual treat! One of the biggest surprises i had in a long time.
","Definitely one of the best cartoons i've ever seen. I haven't been this surprised since The Lion King. Within year's, as i grew up, i have definitely lost an interest for the cartoons. My interest was won back again with Wall-E but since this years or should i say last years, at my opinion highly overrated UP, i lost it again. Than a week or two earlier, i took my young cousin to see How To Train Your Dragon. I was quite skeptical about it. I thought it will be very boring and completely childish. And it is childish. But still, there is something about it that makes it more than just watchable for the adult's, too. I really, really liked. The story is beautiful but simple. The voice over's are great and the Dragon's are characterized brilliantly. All in all, this is a brilliant cartoon that i'm definitely gonna see again, with or without my cousin! I recommend it to everybody. And literally everybody!!!",10,2,5,22 April 2010
Limitless," Could've been a lot better with this premise!
","I liked the idea of a drug that makes your entire brain work. Though, i'd rather make it just a tiny part because with all, if we'd use all of our brain, we could probably move buildings and stuff... Or so they say.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I think it would've been way better if the entire thing was taken more seriously. I mean, the guy makes more mistakes than any regular guy probably would. And he's doing it while he's on this drug. For instance, this is just a tiny ---------------SPOILER---------------, don't you think that a guy as smart as he is when he's on that drug would make sure that the door of his sanctuary, where he wants no one to be able to break in, are made of steel?! There is also the part where he drives very fast and risky which i highly doubt a guy this smart would do, and so on........ This movie should have never been an action movie. This was supposed to be some crazy, super intelligent film written by Charlie Kaufman or someone such. Than it would be great i think. I mean, i never read the novel so i don't know if the movie is much different, but if it's not, even though it's highly entertaining, that would mean that the plot is really waisted.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Bradley Cooper was all right, i guess. I just couldn't escape the impression that he was uninterested. As weird and stupid as that might sound, that was just the impression i had. An Robert De Niro was... Well, what to say? He couldn't be bad if he tried to. Cinematography was okay, at times too Britney Spears Music Video like, but eye grabbing at times, as well.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It was an interesting movie, very fun to watch, but nothing more than a popcorn flick. Unfortunately, because i think the story was good enough to make a lot more out of it. But still, if you want something to kill your time and even think about, i'd definitely recommend this. Good!",6,1,3,25 May 2011
The Descent," It might be because i wasn't in the mood for a horror film when i was watching it, but i didn't find it that scary!
","A small group of friends get trapped in an unknown cave and encounters some monsters that are something like vampires only without all the sunlight and biting and stuff, and now they have to find their way out. That's pretty much all that the movie's about. There is some tragic background story and stuff, but it really doesn't matter.From the moment the movie started, even though i read some good reviews, i really didn't think it will be any good. A, caves became like the biggest horror cliché in this last decade, B, when the entire story is set in a cave there is really not a lot of things that the movie can be about other than people trying to find their way out, and C, there's been far too many movies in the last couple of years about people trying to find their way out. We've seen that kind of stuff over and over again in movies like The Cave, even Pandorum and even some new ones like Sanctum and so on....But even though i got tired of these kind of movies, considering all the good reviews it got, i decided to give it a shot anyway. And like i said in the summary, maybe it's because i just didn't feel like watching this movie at the time, but i just didn't find it that scary. Not scary at all, actually. There are certain scenes that got a bit out of me, but that's about it. It uses the same formula as any horror movie. Sudden appearances, light going on and off and so on... Since the reviews were so good, i at least expected it to be a bit fresh and innovative. It wasn't. Like i mentioned earlier, when the entire story is set in a cave there is really not a lot of things that the movie can be about other than people trying to find their way out.And the ending is missed. When there is only a few of you left, i wont say how many because i don't wanna spoil anything, i don't think it would be a good idea to do what certain somebody did at the end of this movie. It would be completely illogical and no matter how crazy a person might be i highly doubt it that anyone would do it given the circumstances.And why do certain characters, one or two, have no problems killing a whole lot of monsters through out the movie, but than at the ending they have trouble with killing only one, for instance?!? That's one of many irritating things(clichés) about The Descent.It's not boring or dreadful, it has some fun, but there is really nothing more to it at my opinion. Just another horror film with nothing new to offer.",5,1,3,18 September 2011
Pulp Fiction," Excellent
","At the very beginning of writing my comment on this movie i must mention that's it's a perfect movie which will be remembered for a long,long time.Usually i like Quentin Tarantino very much.I think he has that line that makes him stand out from the other director's.Something like Kubrick had.You know,his own style of film making.In Pulp Fiction there is no main character.Everyone is the main character in his own story.And the story of those people come together at one point of the movie.The decision of one character influenced on the life of another character.And so it goes from one to another.This movie is directed great,acted great-especially by Samuel L. Jackson,shooted great and the most importantly written great.I was on a drink with my friend the other day and he said that he think's that Tarantino suck's.I told him that he's stupid and i asked him why he think's that.He said that Kill Bill is a piece of overrated crap.I said OK,that's your opinion but what do you think about Pulp Fiction or Reservoir dog's.He said he didn't watch them.I mean how can someone say that Tarantino suck's only because he watched one of his movies which is probably his worst movie.I'm not saying that Kill Bill suck's i'm just saying that it suck's when it's compared to this one.Anyway i own all the Tarantino's film's so i borrowed him Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dog's.The day or two after he returned me the movies and he said that he liked them both but that he think's that Reservoir dog's is a better one.I wont comment on that because it might be true.They are equal in my opinion.To come back to the subject you don't have to like Pulp Fiction.But you can't say that it's a piece of crap just as you can't say that Tarantino is a shitty director.His movies have style and he has style as a director.Period.Another thing i want to say is that he is the first one that started with making these kind of screenplay's.The movie start's with an ending than it comes to the middle and than at the end we see the beginning.Or something like that.Anyway,his way of writing influenced many film maker's and screenwriter's today.I'm not saying that they copy him i'm just saying that he had influence on them just as John Woo or Ringo Lam had influenced him.But that doesn't mean's he copies them.To short the comment i think this movie is a masterpiece that deserves the reputation it has.I think it will alway's be remembered and watched.It brought so much in the new period of film making,from dialog to story that it can't be called a bad movie.A must see film.Anyone who likes movies and who think's he know's something about movies has to see this film!!!!!!!",10,1,2,9 May 2008
Titanic," Great but far away from being the best!
","In 1997 when i was a kid,my mother took me with her to watch the Titanic.Boy,what a stressful experience that was.I'm there,sitting,surrounded by the whole bunch of grown up's crying the world out of them selves while Jack's giving the speech to Rose about how she's gonna die old in a warm bed,with a whole bunch of kid's and everything!I was so confused i didn't know should i laugh at 'em or should i cry with 'em.Back then i liked this movie.I found it to be among the only drama's that didn't beat me to death with boringness.Maybe it's because there is actually a lot of action in the film.Maybe not gun shooting action but a whole bunch of people running all over the ship in order to save them selves.Anyway,a couple of year's later,i've seen it again.In that timeline between the first time and the second time i've seen it,i became a huge movie lover.I really started to watch movies.And then when i saw it the second time,i still thought it was great.Far away from being the best one but still great.In the mean while,i talked to some people about movies and some of them,not many but still some,told me that Titanic is by far the best movie ever to be made.Man,that irritated me so much that i really started to hate Titanic.And since that time until two month's ago i never seen Titanic.When someone would mention it i'd instantly freak out.Then a couple of month's ago,i talked with this guy about some thing's and we came to the subject of movies.We generally agreeded with each other,he is a man that saw many movies and know's what he's talking about so it was a pleasure talking with him.Anyway,he mentioned Titanic.I instantly freaked and said that it suck's!Then he said that it's a great movie,not the best but still great and that i should rent it.I instantly refused.Then one day,i was at this store that was about to close in a couple of day's and i've seen some movies were selling at a law price.I instantly went home and took some money and then i came back to the store.I bought my self a whole bunch of movies.Though,only a few of them was left because the prices were lowed a couple of day's earlier an i didn't know.Anyway,movies i bought were mostly from the twenty first century because all the classics were sold.However,i accidentally spoted Titanic and i thought,what a hell it's cheap,why not give it a shot.And so i did.I bought it and i've seen it again.After i've seen it,i must say,i was surprised.I really liked it.Even though,it freaked me out at certain part's such as the ending because it just wasn't logical.Couldn't Jack and Rose switch so that he would be on the raft for a few minutes and then she again and so on...That way,they'd both stay alive.Another thing that bugged me is that i honestly doubt that Jack would be willing to give his life for her when he knew her for no more then ten or fifteen day's.If i was Jack,I'd push her of that raft so i could be on it.Jack saw it first,anyway! To bring conclusion to my comment,Titanic deserves to be on 250 list considering that Kill Bill and many other's are on it too.However,it's still far away from being better the such movies as:The Godfather,Pulp Fiction,The Deer Hunter,Braveheart,Schindlers List,Seven Samurai,Lotr,Dances With Wolves,Forrest Gump,It's a Wondefull Life,Ben Hur,Goodfellas,Reservoir Dog's,Gladiator,Hannah And Her Sisters and so on,and so on.....",10,0,4,17 September 2009
Thor," Fails with certain things, but still highly entertaining!
","First thing i need to say is that i'm not very familiar with Thor as a character. I heard of the comic books and everything, but i've never actually read one. With that being said, i can't say whether the movie is faithful to it's original material, but i can say that as a movie it works. It's got that fine line between science fiction and fantasy that in a way makes it stand out from all the other 'SUPER-HERO' movies i've seen. I like all the mythology behind it and all the interesting perspectives of looking at, or at least comparing science to magic. And even though i think that the beginning is too sword and sorcery like as far as the dialogue goes, the rest of the movie works fine in that matter. There are even some good jokes made of it when Thor comes to earth.As surprising and admirable as it is that Kenneth Branagh, who is considered a highly artistic director, directed this movie, i must say that i think that it was the wrong choice. I just don't think he has an eye for action or for a spectacle as some directors like Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer and Zack Snyder do. I'm not saying that directing is bad, i just think that certain action sequences could've been done way more exciting and simply more cool, which would fit this kind of movie. However, i also think that he brought some goods to the movie as well. And also, now that i think of it, i'm not so surprised that he decided to direct this movie. It has that Shakespearean quality about it. All the family like friendship's and family relationships and betrayals, which were quite predictable by the way, give this movie that tragic undertone which Shakespeares work always had.That is one of the main problem's i had with the movie, it's too predictable and certain things just don't work and are very poorly done. Like for instance, the relationship between Thor and Jane. It happens so quickly and so structurally bad that it's barely noticeable. Don't be surprised if by the end of the movie you ask your self, when did these two fall in love!?! The two characters were not given enough time with each other, or they did even too much but none of it being a romantic time, and even though they were seeing each other through out the movie i never, not once, had a feeling that they took it to another level or that they were even about to. Well, the camp fire scene near the end looked like they were about to, but guess what, they didn't! Another thing i didn't like is that the only character in the entire movie that is somewhat characterized is Thor. All the other characters are completely ignored and barely anything that happens has anything to do with them. That stands especially for characters from earth.I'd recommend the movie, but with a note that if the things i mentioned were done better, the movie would've been a lot better. Very interesting and entertaining, but....",8,1,2,16 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," A masterpiece that's not made for everyone!
","As i already wrote on my The assassination of Jesse James by the coward Robert Ford title,this is an artistic movie.It's a movie that radiates with perfection and life.When you watch it look more carefully and you will see that it's a very realistic movie.It's Like Jesse James,a psychological movie that studies a mental condition of the certain person or person's under the different term's of life.For example through the movie you can clearly see how he slowly start's to be more and more greedy and what kind of pathetic meat sack he really is which you definitely couldn't see in the first hour or fourthy five minutes of the film.And that's what i think that's very,very skilled made in this film because at my opinion one of the hardest thing's in screenplay writing and directing is character development!...Which is perfectly made in this movie.In the first hour of the movie Daniel Day Lewis or Daniel Plainview look's like the most carrying father and the most decent person that tries to make it in oil business so he could give his son a great life.However as you watch the movie you start to notice that it's nothing but an illusion.Or better yet that it's a lie.The first time it get's obvious that he is a moron is when his son get's deaf an he gives him alcohol so he shouldn't watch over him.I mean what kind of a person you need to be to get your son drunk just so you could get him off your back.I wont write anything else of the character development in this film because no matter how many thing's i write about it,it wont really matter because you have to see it your self.However i must say a few more thing's about acting.This movie is one of the best acted movies ever.Not only by Daniel Day Lewis who gave one of the best performances ever in this film but also about Paul Dano who was surprisingly worth of at least being nominated.In this movie he proves how stupid the Oscar's can be.He definitely deserves at least a nomination.He was brilliant as a frustrated,fanatical,lying and sick priest who believes to be a prophet.The relationship between his character and Daniel Day's character is best to be described as a fuel that wait's on that one spark to light it up.The tension's between the two of them are followed through the entire film.An the best part about it is that they are both the same greedy and sick kind of men.Actually on the second thought Paul Dano's character is worse because Daniel Day's character at least never said for him self that he's not what he is.Another thing that's great in this movie is directing and the story it self.The story get's incredibly good at the very ending of the movie because then all the thing's come together and because then you actually see what's the movie about.I'm not saying that the story isn't good through the entire movie but that the ending is the best part of it.The directing is also great because it gave the artistic and realistic atmosphere to the movie.It's not directed on a usual way so everyone could look the movie and enjoy because a lot of people will think it's a very boarding movie but on the way so a certain people as my self could watch it and exam,with satisfaction the art of film making.There is nothing more to say about this movie but that you should watch it carefully with patience and see that it's a great movie worth of a few more Oscar's.At least at my opinion.But as i already said it's not made for everyone even though i personally think that it's a masterpiece.Enjoy!",10,3,5,17 January 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Definitely the best Vampire movie ever to be made!
","This movie is so great.It's perfect.Simply beautiful.Many people are sceptical when it comes to this movie or any other movie that includes vampires and in some hand i can understand them because most of the vampire movies do suck,but not this one.This is a horror movie that's actually a love movie.Many horror movies have tried to be a horror movie with a love story in 'em but that's not what this one tries.This is a love movie with a horror story in it.There is so many thing's that make this movie as good as it is so i'm just gonna name some of them.Garry Oldman is brilliant as Dracula,Keanu Reeves actually wasn't irritating,Winona Ryder was excellent as a woman who's fiancé has been kidnapped by the same man or should i say the same thing that kidnapped her fiancé,direction is great as expected since this is Francis Ford Copolla's movie,production is great,dialog is magnificent just as the screenplay generally,cinematography is simply perfect,costumography is great....To short the story this movie is great in every technical and every other aspect.On the second thought there is just one thing that could be better.Anthony Hopkins character better known as Van Helsing.Now,don't get me wrong here,Hopkins was great as Van Helsing,it's just that his character has no deep background that such a character deserves.At least not at my opinion.I forgot to mention one more thing that's brilliant in this movie which is rarely,an that's atmosphere.The mood.It's creepy,scary and heartbreaking in the right moment's.Especially at the beginning when Garry Oldman stab's a sword in that cross and when it start's bleeding.All i have left to say to you guy's who haven't watched this movie is 'watch it' an to you guy's who have watched it 'watch it again'.I know i will.Oh,yeah,just one more thing....Screw you Academy for not even nominating this movie for 'the best picture' or Garry Oldman for 'the best actor'!S-c-r-e-w you!And i must say that it's also shameful that Watchmen or The Prestige or many other movies,which are also good or some even great,are on 250 list an this one's not!!! Bram Stoker's Dracula is my recommendation to everyone because it's a wonderful movie that deserves much more attention then it has gotten.At least more than Mamma Mia and other stupidities that are earning a whole lot of money for nothing!!! Enjoy!10/10!",10,0,3,24 March 2009
The Wrestler," Just what i expected and more!
","This comment maybe contain's some spoiler's.I watched the wrestler the other day and as i expected it was great.The entire movie is based on the main character Randy The Ram Robinson.There is no screwing around in this movie and that's what i like.Through the whole movie we know what kind of person he is and what kind of person he was.In some way's good in some way's bad.He is a wrestler that's getting too old for his job but he don't want's to make piece with that fact.Anyway,as he find's out that he has a heart problem's and that he can't wrestle anymore,he begin's to understand what he throw away for his career and he tries to win it back.So he contact's his daughter after a long time and tries to restore the relationship with her.Beside that he start's falling in love with a stripper.As the time goes and as he makes a better relationship with his daughter he still can't accept the fact that his wrestling career is over.So the question is will he throw his career away for all the other thing's in life including life it self or will he go back to wrestling and risk having a heart attack.Some people will say that this movie has many subject's but i think it doesn't.It's only subject is that he has to choose between having a normal life or not.And under that subject belong's the relationship between him and his daughter too.It's a great movie that don't sniff's around but it say's what it has to say and that's it.And that's what i like about this movie.However when i watched it my friend said that the ending ruined the entire movie for him.That he don't understand's what happened next but i think that that's the best part about it! I also have to mention that the movie is followed by great acting from Mickey Rourke which was inexpressibly good and of course from Melisa Tomei which was also great as a single mom who work's as a stripper only so she could feed her son.She really was good too but Mickey was the best generally,not only in this movie but generally this year.I think the reason for it is because he wasn't really acting,he was more him self in this role since he had similar life as Randy The Ram Robinson.Among the million thing's that are great in this movie,one stand's up an that's The Ram as a character.He is just so realistic and weird.He lives a lonely life and he is only happy when wrestling.One of the better scenes in the movie if you ask me is when he call's that nine or ten year's old kid to come and play Nintendo with him.That was absolutely brilliant description of having a lonely life.Absolutely brilliant! One other thing that's great is camera,the way the movie was shooted.It's just so great and realistic.It don't changes angles so much but it more kind of follows the character through the room which gives so much realism in the certain scenes and the entire movie.Really great achievement.I wont write anything else about the movie,i will just say that this movie i recommend to everyone because it is one great movie.Maybe even the greatest in 2008 and i think it's shameful that it didn't receive The Movie Of The Year nomination.S-h-a-m-e-f-u-l!!!The academy should be ashamed of it self.This is a must watch movie.Watch it under any cost!!!",10,1,2,12 February 2009
Inception," The most intelligent action movie ever made!
","I really had high hopes for this one. As a writer, i can say that it wasn't an easy job to write this. One, because it's hard to keep the structure straight and two, because the story is quite original and innovative so it takes a lot of talent and imagination to turn it into a script. A good one at least. I was really afraid that this will turn out to be an action movie... as it did. Though, i must say that i wasn't disappointed one bit. Even with all the mindless action sequences and all the twists that were going on through the film, it managed to stay intelligent and surprising. All the credit to the writer for it. Once again, it wasn't an easy job.-------------------------------Usually in Nolan's movies i really don't see a lot from actors. With this one i was blown away. I hope and think that DiCaprio, Ellen Page and Marion Cotillard should all, at least, be nominated for the Academy Award. As should Christopher Nolan for The Best Script and maybe, i'm not so sure, for The Best Director. Also, i have to mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt who was also great in his role but still, the role it self didn't ask too much so i doubt he'll get any credit for it. The same for Tom Hardy.-------------------------------Even i think the movie is very intelligent and ultimately brilliant, i still think that it would work even better as more of a drama than action. I think it would be taken a lot more seriously by voters and that in that case it would be able to show it's true potential.------------------------------- However, that doesn't stay in my way to call Inception a masterpiece in it's genre. I hope the action movies will go this direction from now on and be more intelligent.-------------------------------Inception is a great movie that you will be thinking about days after you see it. I've seen it only once but i'm planning to see it again. Three or four times, at least. I really think it has to be seen a couple of times to see it's mistakes and possible holes. Like this it's impossible to spot any because the script is so well crafted with a whole bunch of thing's thrown in it that could possibly be there to distract you from the very things i mentioned. All in all, it's a great movie that you will definitely enjoy watching more than once!!!! As i said, a masterpiece in it's genre and the best action movie in the history!",10,3,13,22 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A brilliant movie but it's still far away from being the best one!
","Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie.It's directed good,acted good,written good and it definitely deserved a few Oscar's.There is no doubt about it.It also deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list,as it is.However,i must say that it's very,very overrated on IMDb.Even though it's a great movie,it's still far,far away from being the best one!All of you who haven't seen this movie-should see it.But please don't believe in IMDb's rating's!If you do you might be disappointed because even though this is a great movie it's still not even close to being the best one!

Ben-Hur," Worthy of all the hype around it!
",Ben Hur is one of the best epics in the movie history and at my opinion the best of all the great movies William Wyler has made. Simply brilliant in every single way. William Wyler's directing in this movie is so ahead of it's time and the screenplay is just so brilliant and well interpreted that i'm simply amazed with how good this movie is. This movie's got it all. It's filled with brilliant action and heartbreaking moments that are never irritating or unnecessary. It's really hard to make those two thing's work so good together but William Wyler did it all with such style and perfect timing that it's near four hours of running time just passes by you.Anything i say about this movie is completely unnecessary since it really speaks for it self. All the Eleven Oscars it got are well deserved and i'm just sorry that it didn't get the one for best screenplay too.Watch this movie! It's brilliant! If not for the movie it self than at least for the chariot's scene! It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!,10,0,2,23 July 2010
The Deer Hunter," What's wrong with people?I repeat,What's wrong with people?
","OK,but seriously what's wrong with people? This movie definitely doesn't deserves to be on a hundred and thirty eight place on 250 list.It deserves to be in the top ten if not five on any list!!! The Deer Hunter is one of the best movies ever to be made.It's a sin to rate this movie low.Not only low but with nine or eight,too.This movie deserves a ten from everyone.I am not planning on writing about how good direction,acting,screenplay and a lot of other thing's are in this movie!I'm just gonna say that if you haven't watched it,you should make it your top priority to do so.That should be the goal of your life.This is definitely one of the best movies in the history of film making.Which mean's that you should watch it.I am proposing a revolution on IMDb.It's called 'We want The Deer Hunter in the top ten or five'.With one word we want it where it belong's.My recommendation to everyone.Everyone.'When i die the only thing i will feel sorry for is that i wont be able to watch this movie again'!!! Watch it under any cost.W-A-T-C-H....I-T!!!",10,2,5,27 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of the trilogy, the best in it's genre and one of the best movies ever!
","LOTR 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the Oscars it got were completely well deserved! In fact, i would add a couple. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and Bernard Hill all deserved a Best Actor nomination. And i would also mention Sean Bean who's performance of Boromir in the first part was completely underrated! It was a great performance and i can't believe he wasn't nominated! I am usually a big fan of the book's. I've noticed that some people complain about Peter Jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. It's true. He did do that but i think it's actually better this way. Don't get me wrong, the book's are magical. It's just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. Peter Jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. I'm glad he did! Visual's are revolutionary for the time and great for today, writing is great, directing is great, acting is great, cinematography is great, make up is great, costimography is great, fighting choreography is great,... and so on... and so on...All in all, this movie is just brilliant!!! One of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in it's genre. Deserves all the award's and all the hype it got!!! A TRUE MASTERPIECE!",10,1,2,19 June 2010
Jackie Brown," A good movie but not as good as it's director's reputation!
","Jackie Brown is a fine movie.Well adapted,well acted and well directed.It's interesting and not predictable,which is most important.However,i do feel that it misses that Tarantino's style.As we watch it it's obvious that this is not Tarantino's original work.His original screenplay.There are no dialog's and scenes which mark Tarantino as an outstanding director and a writer.It's a good movie,there is no question about it.It's just that...I don't know.It's just very noticeable that this is not his original writing.That's the main flaw in this movie.It just doesn't look's like it's his.But here is something to cheer you up,Robert De Niro was great as usual!He was really brilliant in this movie.I can tell you right now that you wont regret watching this movie.At least not as long as you forget the fact that it's Tarantino's!7/10.Enjoy!",7,1,2,27 March 2009
Gangs of New York," Chicago won The Best Picture over the Gangs Of New York!Can somebody please rewind the time back in 2002 and blow up the Academy!Thank you!
","The 2002 Oscar incident a.k.a Academy votes for Chicago remind's me of another incident back in 1998 when Shakespeare In Love won the best picture over Saving Private Ryan!Back in the 1998 i hoped and prayed that a mistake like that one will never happen again!But,unfortunately,i was wrong!It happened again in 2002 when Gangs Of New York lost The Best Picture because of Chicago which is not a bad movie but also not that good movie to be better than this one.I must say i am honestly doubting in the professionality of the Academy because they've made so many big mistakes that it is impossible to believe in their judgment! As we all know,Gang's Of New York were nominated for ten Academy Award's including those for best screenplay,best costume design,best director and best actor in a leading role(Daniel Day Lewis).The reason i mentioned only those is that beside the best picture nomination,this movie deserved those the most an it didn't get them.And as i said before,i will say for a thousand times more,'Shame on you Academy'!!! To all of you who haven't seen this movie,yet,all i must say is that you should because it's a top notch movie that deserves all of your attention and it definitely deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list but as before,IMDb prooves once more that it suck's sometimes!!!",10,2,4,13 April 2009
Braveheart," A historical nonsense but one of the best movies ever to be made if you ask me ! ! !
","I really can't see why would anyone, except for English, hate this movie! They are the only ones that have the reason to because it really is a historical nonsense but i still think that they're overreacting when they say that it's anti-semitic or something! Quite soon, people will say that Lethal Weapon is anti-semitic only because Mel Gibson is in it! ----- This is definitely one of the best movies ever to be made! And no matter do you like it or not, no one who knows something about movies cannot say that directing, cinematography and acting are not good! They're great! Especially the directing! But don't get me wrong, acting is at the top too. Mel should have won a statue for Best Leading Role and Brendan Gleeson should have at least been nominated for Best Supporting Role along with Patrick McGoohan and Angus Macfadyen. This is really a well played movie! And the cinematography is flawless.----- I was definitely expecting it to win all the Oscar's it got but i must say that i was quite surprised when James Horner lost for best music! The music is just brilliant! I really can't believe it! -----The script is beautifully written but way over-exaggerated in a way that it's a complete historical nonsense so i guess that having that fact alone in mind, it didn't deserve the Best Script Award after all!-----All in all, this is a brilliant movie with the saddest ending ever! The only movie i actually cried at! If it wasn't about Scot's and English and if it was a fantasy about two imagined nations in a imagined world, everyone would like it! Even English! For some people it's hard to ignore a whole bunch of historically inaccurate thing's that this movie has, which i can understand in some sort of way, but if you can do that than this will be one of the best if not the best movie you ever saw!!!!!

","Slumdog millionaire surprised me in every aspect.It's a really good movie.Very enjoyable and interesting!The crew is good,the directing is great,music is great,the screenplay is great and the story is original.There is one more thing i was very surprised by in this movie an that's cinematography.There are only few flaw's in this film but they are not relevant so i'm just gonna say one that is.That flaw is that the movie is forgettable.Even though it won eight Oscar's i don't think it will be remembered in fifteen year's from now.It's personality is just not as strong as it's technical aspect's and the movie it self.I don't know,maybe i'm wrong but i just don't think that it will be remembered and called a classic one day.For example when someone mention's Gone with the wind or Dances with wolves or Braveheart or Gladiator or Forrest Gump or Clockwork Orange,i instantly remember every part of them and i remember those strong scenes and dialog's that on some way marked the history of film industry.And that's something that i don't see in this one.When someone says to me that some movie doesn't deserves the Oscar's it got i always say to that person that you have to look at it competition.If the competition wasn't very good then he deserved them.That's why i think that this movie deserved the Oscar's it got because it's competition wasn't that hard.Well,actually on the second thought i think that there are two movies better then this one this year an those are The Wrestler and The Dark Knight.So i think that it didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar.But when i think again those two movies weren't nominated for Best Picture so it did after all.Just one more thing i have to say an that's not about this movie.It's about the Wrestler on which i already wrote a comment an i don't want to change it so i'm just gonna write it here.I think that it's shameful that Mickey Rourke didn't get the Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar.Don't get me wrong Sean Penn was great in Milk but he wasn't even close to Mickey.He gave one of the best performances ever in the Wrestler and i think that 'Academy' should be ashamed of it self.Anyway,to come back to Slumdog Millionaire,it's a great movie that's definitely worth seeing but it's also a movie that definitely doesn't deserves a 38'th place on IMDb's 250 list.",9,0,5,26 February 2009
Born on the Fourth of July," Beautiful redemption story with much more to it!
","Born On The Fourth Of July is a great movie! One of many masterpieces that are not completely recognized as such! Ronnie Kovic is a young man living in a small town in the time of the Vietnam War! All filled with pride and honor he decides to go to war and fight for his country! The story is basically centered on that point on! War changes his entire life and he must face the fact that he was, as many other's, tricked to go to war and fight against so called '' communism disease ''! The story follows his path of redemption towards accepting that everything he believed in and fought for was not as pure and sacred as he thought! And also about him dealing with some thing's he's done that are his burden ever since!------------------------------------- The movie is directed great, written great and acted great! This is my favorite Oliver Stone movie and this is definitely Tom's greatest performance!!! Tom Cruise was just brilliant and it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for The Best Leading Role!!! Just as it's a shame that the movie didn't win for The Best Picture and The Best Screenplay!!!-------------------------------------- Watch this movie!!! It will make you feel a lot better and see thing's much clearly! This is a masterpiece!!! --------------------------------------- And to end my comment, i will quote Ron Kovic,'' I am the living death, a Memorial Day on wheels. I am your Yankee Doodle Dandy, your John Wayne come home, your Fourth of July firecracker exploding in the grave. ''",10,0,1,26 June 2010
