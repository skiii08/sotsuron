Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Movie
","There are some people that might not like this movie. People who like science fiction or is an avid Starwars fan will love it... anyone who hates Sci-Fi or the sad sad folks who hate SW will hate it. The FX are amazing, I have never seen a movie with such great FX. This movie may not break Titanic record, but like anyone cares. Watch this in a theater... it will suck on video. You know what I mean by that.If there is one bad thing about this movie is it is too short and there is little plot. Hopefully Episode 2 will be longer and have more plot. Enjoy the movie folks!",10,0,0,6 June 1999
