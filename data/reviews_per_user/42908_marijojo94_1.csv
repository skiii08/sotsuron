Howl's Moving Castle," It rocks!!!
","I love this movie. It really rocks. I love all the Hayao Miyazaki movies, specially this one.If you like magic and really amazing stories you should see it. It is about a woman that is cursed by a wicked witch. She turns into an old lady. I don't want to say anything more because I want it to be a surprise.Im sure you will like it. Its one of my favorite movies . I also recommend you to see Porco Rosso, Spirited away and Mononoke princess, all of them are Hayao Miyazaki's films.Enjoy!!!",10,2,3,9 February 2007
