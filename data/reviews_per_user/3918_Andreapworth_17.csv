The King's Speech," As wonderful as everyone else has said
","First of all, I have read 2 or 3 biographies of George VI and was a little leery of the film. HOWEVER, the movie was so faithful to so many aspects of his life that I was very impressed. In fact, I was blown away. The script even worked in the fact that Elizabeth did, indeed, turn George (Bertie) down twice before she finally accepted his marriage proposal.And the script brilliantly worked in when and why George's stuttering began, which is based on fact. And film emphasized how totally he was in his brother's, the Prince of Wales' shadow. And it brought out how literally besotted David was with Wallis Simpson. And how his heritage was tossed away to be with her.Every cast member was simply wonderful, or 'spot-on'. Bonham-Carter was simply wonderful and believable. You could truly feel her love and devotion to George. Will have to buy this one to watch over again. Truly the only thing I can say against it is that Geoffrey Rush didn't receive the 'Best Supporting' award. He was so great.",10,0,0,2 April 2011
That Thing You Do!," Fun musical romp
","As many people have said, it's an homage to a simpler time. Love the small visual nods to 'A Hard Day's Night' with the boys running through the simulation of the states. Also the hint of the same thing that happened to Lennon with the 'he's engaged' posting on the monitor. Of course, Lennon was actually engaged, if not already married!I truly don't get tired of this film. Just a feel-good movie. Also liked everything I read about how Hanks insisted that the actors learn to play their instruments well enough to look good in the film. Some of them practiced several hours a day.It's fun to see his wife pop in as a waitress where there's good jazz. Such a seemingly fun woman - but what else would you expect from Tom Hanks' wife? No, it didn't win any awards. But it's a 'keeper'. Watch it. Such fun!",8,0,0,27 July 2013
The Terminator," A dozen times, and it never gets old
","And some of that is James Cameron's directing, but some of it is just a good story. Much better story, in some ways, than the one when the Terminator could morph into whatever shape he wanted, but that film had some good, scary scenes. And the end of that Termninator is really good film editing. But I like THIS one, before things got complicated!I know that part of the reason I like this, original one is that my oldest brother loved Arnold and would frequently say 'I'll be back'. And I suppose that's the line everyone remembers. And everyone remembers 'you are terminated'.My brother is no longer with us, but I think about him whenever this film comes on cable. Worth watching, if for no other reason than it's also the beginning of Linda Hamilton's career.",9,4,5,17 November 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Mind-blowing
","Mathew Mc. obviously deserves a bit of a salute. His efforts to slim way down brings to mind, obviously, Christian Bale. Not bad company to be in!But the REAL STAR is Jared Leto. I know his other work and kept reminding myself that he/she was really a transvestite. And so sad to see the drug use (shh). And he/she was truly pretty. Of course, in real life, he's s a gorgeous guy. So,I hope the Academy will take note!Also interesting to hear of the Interferon drugs talked about. Now THAT'S something I know about. I have M.S. and inject myself once a week with it. It slows the progression of the disease Too bad the movie doesn't mention the other druga now available. Perhaps they weren't around then.I'm not a doctor, just more familiar with some of the drugs - would be great if I weren't!",8,27,49,10 November 2013
Enchanted," Fabulous, Wonderful and truly enchanting
","Just read all the other appreciative reviews! This movie was the best thing I'd seen in a long time.Once you get to the New York scenes, it's really funny. Several times people in the theater with me laughed loudly.Patrick Dempsey's daughter is just right. Loved the line and scene when she tells Giselle that if you can't find a fairy godmother, then the credit card is the next best thing.Also the little parts with the chipmunk are SO cute. Can't remember his name (Pip?), but he is great. And it makes you think about trying to communicate using eye expressions and sign language, or animal sign language.Go see it! It's money well spent.",Null,1,2,7 December 2007
Remember the Titans," Don't know how ANYBODY cannot love this movie
","Let me start by saying that Denzel should have won the Oscar for THIS PERFORMANCE. When he runs/marches everyone to the Gettysberg graveyard, his talk to all the players sums everything up so beautifully.All the actors are spot-on, from Gary ('Superman') to the quarterback from California ('Sunshine'),to Rev, and the first role cutie Ryan Gosling. The film accurately portrays the race tensions of the time, summed up by when Gary's girlfriend won't shake hands with Junius. And when Gary's mother doesn't WANT to get to know Junius.I've seen the movie so many times, but I never tire of it. Truly worth watching.",10,2,5,16 October 2009
The Princess Bride," See it again
","Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.Several years ago I worked in a great company where the 'art' department wouldn't even talk to you unless you knew all about this movie. So many parts of it are so great, not the least of which is the fencing that Rob Reiner insisted that they practice over and over. I once read that Mr. Reiner kept telling the actors - throw the lines away - this isn't theater. They're funny, so keep going! And it shows in the movie. We would all swear that Mandy Patinkin was a world-class fencer. Just a great actor, I'm afraid.So many of the lines are so memorable, like 'inconceivable!' With the follow-up line of 'you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think means'.And of course the part with Billy Chrystal and Carol Kane and Peter Falk. If you've never seen this movie, get out from under the rock and see it. You will see what you've been missing all these years. Inconceivable!",10,1,2,19 November 2012
Schindler's List," It needs to be seen
","I feel really goofy trying to write anything about this film. It's all been said on this site and most of it is true.The first thing to underline is that Ralph F. should have won best supporting actor in a supporting role. I was so stunned that he did not. He is so good that for months I didn't know he wasn't German. And his character is truly vile. Read up on the real Amon Goeth and you will see what an evil man he portrayed. He probably didn't care, but good golly.Secondly, having dated an observant Jew for a long time, I can attest to the Talmud quotation. My boyfriend believed and lived that precept.No, this film is not earth-shaking, but once you see it, please remember that some of the people who made the film with Spielberg were, themselves, survivors. If you remember that Oscar ceremony, you might remember that one man got up to accept the award and gave the numbers that he had tattooed on his arm. It really happened!",10,28,47,22 February 2013
Wimbledon," 8
","Fun movie, especially if you play tennis, which I have. Betthany showed his movements competently, as did Dunst.The real fun for me was watching Evert and McEnroe do the commentary. So enjoyable after all the sports people have commented on their many wonderful matches. Loved the part where Chrissie asked John if he knew all about the questions about a line shot - in or out, and how labored the questioning of it got. Funny, when your remember all the shenanigans McEnroe used to put officials through.No, its not a great sports movie, or even a tennis movie, but thoroughly enjoyable. Again, the key is if the audience has ever followed the tennis world and better yet, played it.",8,1,1,2 June 2012
Pride & Prejudice," Didn't match up to the A&E miniseries
","Sorry, but I much prefer Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, as well all the other actors in the television series, which I thankfully recorded.Nobody in the film version was anywhere as good as the A&E version, with the notable exception of Dame Judy Dench. Her part was beautiful, of course, And this is grousing about acting styles, but NOBODY could be better as Darcy than Colin Firth, and McFadyen was a poor second. And the mother in the television version was simply marvelous, as was the embarrassing Kitty. And Wickham was perfectly cast as a deceiving but charming scoundrel.Plus the character of Jane in the television version was perfectly portrayed. And of course, Jennifer portrayed Elizabeth wonderfully.And I can't forget to mention Crispin Bonham-Carter, from the renowned family of great actors! And many other 'supporting' roles. All beautifully portrayed.I almost put Robert Hardy in this mix, but then remembered he was in Sense and Sensibility. He has such a long and distiguished acting career that it's easy to imagine him in any notable role. But not in this series! Golly, I'll have to get the tape out and watch tomorrow!",6,3,9,25 August 2009
Singin' in the Rain," A GREAT musical treat
","What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly.The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal??The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.",10,0,2,17 June 2013
Les Mis√©rables," Know your history and enjoy
","I'd been warned that I might cry. Well, tear up I did.But I was proud that I did not sing out loud to some of the music. Just mouthed the words. As I was with a close theater friend and we've both sung on stage, I thought this was a great accomplishment! If you've never read the book or seen another production, get yourself educated.As we walked out of the theater, some people were saying 'I didn't know it was about the French revolution'. And I had to stop and ask them if they didn't read the words at the very beginning of the movie. Not very politic, but golly, hello! Loved Anne Hathaway tremendously. No wonder she has such short hair now. She so much like a waif, but she can truly sing. What a surprise to me.No surprise about Hugh Jackman. What an actor! And the Thenardier's were fabulous, too. A real history lesson about hard financial times.At the end of the movie, the entire theater clapped. Haven't experience that since 'Seabiscuit'. Everyone was enthusiastic, needless to say.",10,0,1,21 January 2013
The Untouchables," One of the best
","Pretty much what has already been said covers it all. Fantastic film by De Palma. Great performance by the wonderful Connery.So many parts that you think 'oh, yeah, this is a good section' and continue to watch it! The part where they are in the train station and there's the woman with her baby in the carriage. Golly, there's just so much to that scene. When it becomes vital that Ness can trust Stone's aim.I just know that when I saw it recently and discussed it with my oldest brother, he mentioned that exact scene and said 'it doesn't get much better than that'. Which is everything in a nutshell.And of course, the wonderful period feel to much of the outdoor shots. Yeah, I know it's on a set somewhere, but it makes you feel like it's the 20s. And of course the fabulous line of 'it's not the Chicago way'.",9,0,0,31 July 2013
The Holiday," Fun and very good
","Saw this at the movie theater last Christmas and enjoyed it then. Just rented from my service and enjoyed all over again and am thinking about buying my own copy. It's truly that enjoyable.Kate Winslet is wonderful, as usual. I was surprised how good Cameron Diaz was. No, she'll never be on the level of Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, but she was fairly solid.Jude Law was also very enjoyable and I got a kick out the scenes with his kids. Jack Black was a delight! I can never watch 'Driving Miss Daisy' withoutthinking of the scene in the video store.And, last but not least, Eli Wallach was super. A real joy.Wouldn't was to move to L.A. but I'll take that house in England any time!",8,0,1,12 April 2007
The Blind Side," Delightful and thought-provoking
","Saw it at the theater, and when it hit DVD release, thought 'why not?' And I'm glad I saw it again. Missed a few things the first time around.As other commenter's have said, it is a true story, told well and in a touching manner. You can almost feel Micnael's disbelief when he is asked to spend the night with the Touhey family. And you can definitely feel the bonds of the family coming together around him.Perhaps the best scene, and probably what pushed Sandra to the Oscar, is the speech she gives to Michael on the football field, helping him to see his key role on the team. And the scene, towards the end in which she 'confronts the thugs' where Michael used to live. Her delivery of 'yeah, and it shoots well the other days of the week, too'. You don't see it coming and it has a little extra impact because of it.The comparison of the family members football players' slots was so moving and well-scripted. That's the scene that I will play over in my head until the next time I rent the movie! Stay strong Sandra, like you were in this movie!",8,0,1,19 May 2010
The Queen," Helen Mirren is magnificent
","Helen Mirren is truly a wonderful actress and portrayed the Queen in a full, complete fashion. Although the movie brought painful memories of Diana's death and even some tears to my eyes, it was a great movie.The actor portraying Tony Blair was right on target. He may not be as attractive as Mr. Blair, but he's close. And he portrayed the dilemma in advising the Queen to speak to the public about Diana.James Cromwell was solid as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings was right on target as Charles. However, the woman that portrayed the Queen Mother was less than enjoyable. Everything I've ever read has indicated that she was very sympathetic to Diana All in all, a good film. And Helen Mirren should be nominated and win an Oscar. Even though she 'cleaned up' at the Emmy's, she should get the acknowledgement for this movie.",9,0,1,5 November 2006
Apollo 13," Never, ever get tired of this film
","I saw this movie with a good friend. We were SO IMPRESSED that we left the movie saying 'vote for Opie'.As many other people have said, we know the end (safety for the crew). But even when I get a copy of the film, I am still glued to the screen.Many actors were SO good in this film, particularly Gary Senise, working so hard like the astronaut that he is, until he finally gets the 'right' sequence for the return of the guys in space.Again, so many good performances by all of the actors. Loved when Ed Harris was so touched when the ship was in the ocean and his effort to keep his face straight and brush away any tears when he faces the rest of his crew.Also, the funny part when Jim Lovell's Mom is glued to the television and Marilyn Lovell brings in some people do distract her. When she introduces them as Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, and the mother turns to them and asks them if they hope to be in the space program. What a hoot!Ron didn't get any award for this wonderful movie, but it will live in the minds of everyone who has ever seen it.",10,3,4,11 October 2013
