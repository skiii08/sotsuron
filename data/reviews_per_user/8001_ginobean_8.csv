"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," basic premise was flawed
","I liked Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, so I saw this movie.Halfway through the movie, I realized I didn't want him to get the girl (the Thandie Newton character). That pretty ruined the movie for me.It didn't make any sense -- if you're an attractive, successful woman like Odell (Thandie Newton), do you : a. go for the loser who can't seem to get his life straight; b. go for the financially successful, handsome guy ?For most women, I think this is really a no-brainer.Acting wise, Pegg and Newton and Azaria were fine. I think the failure was in the script.",3,1,2,15 March 2009
Skyfall," fairly mediocre and a little boring in the second half
","Not sure why this film has such a high average rating. I thought it was a fairly mediocre, boilerplate Bond film. First hour was fairly interesting and well paced, but then the second really dragged on and I thought the pacing was really too slow. They could probably have taken out at least half an hour of footage without detracting from the storyline. Not quite I got the Bardem character's motivation. Basically, he was an MI6 agent who was caught and then his suicide capsule didn't work, so he did a complete 180 and became a villain ? That doesn't make any sense to me. It's like if Superman decided to become a villain because he had a really bad day. Craig is a very good actor, but the problem with Bond films in general is that it's already so over the top that unless you're able to find just the right balance, it comes off as machismo buffoonery. By the halfway point, I had mostly lost interest in the storyline and watched it mostly to find out what eventually happened. The story itself seemed fairly boilerplate and not terribly creative or well done. As a side note, the female lead, Berenice Marlohe, was both stunningly gorgeous and a superb actress.",6,5,12,5 April 2013
Oldboy," Very enjoyable thriller
","Very nicely done with neat twists and turns in the plot ! Visual effects were pretty well done.Very well acted and paced.One gripe was the main character gets a bit overly melodramatic at times throughout the movie, but I think this is a form of Korean machismo, and I've definitely seen this type of Korean machismo firsthand. So I guess it's true to life.This movie reminds me of the mathematical object -- the Mobius strip. Watch the movie and I think you'll understand what I mean.I think one fight scene should have been reworked by the director to make it more believable (the one involving the hammer). The last scene -- I didn't see it coming, but it fit the movie perfectly.",9,9,80,14 September 2005
Remember the Titans," enjoyable, but a bit too melodramatic
","When I started watching this movie, I thought to myself, 'this is an important movie'. This is a movie about discrimination and racism in the early 1970s and the courage it took to deal with it.And the movie was fairly enjoyable and it was clear who the good guys were and who the bad guys were. Denzel gave a stellar performance. And the actor portraying the football captain did a great job as well in capturing the nuances and subtleties of his character. But it seemed overly melodramatic. I find it inconceivable that the Board of Education would have appointed coach Boone with the intention of firing him after his first loss. It just seemed a bit much and overblown. And then one of the referees started intentionally calling bad plays against Boone's team -- I thought it was highly improbable that this happened the way it was depicted in the movie. And then I started wondering what really happened. Frankly, I would have preferred something closer to reality than what was depicted. It was all a bit too melodramatic and fanciful and not grounded in reality, so much so that I felt fairly cynical toward the movie and wondered if anything outside of the basic facts was even true -- the basic facts being that Boone was hired to coach and his team won the state championship the first year.As a comparison, imagine a movie where Abraham Lincoln uses his magical powers to sway the course of the Civil War in the right direction. Would it have added drama to what actually happened ? Yes, but then it becomes a piece of fiction and starts to bear little/no relevance to our society.Similarly, I think there was so much dramatic license taken that, instead being an important biographical work, the movie ended up being a sappy melodrama that bore little no relationship to what actually must have happened. As a piece of fiction, it's fairly enjoyable and dramatic. As a biographical/historical piece, it's a fairly empty and unsatisfying piece of work.In sum, it's like junk food -- it tastes good, but it's not really good or healthy for you in the long run...",6,0,0,14 April 2013
Mr. Nobody," pretty to watch but seemed fairly pointless
","The special effects were pretty cool, and overall, the technical elements seemed fairly well done. And the story seemed to flow fairly well. The big problem for me was in trying to determine what the story was. There seemed to be multiple parallel tracks that the protagonist seemed to have taken simultaneously. So he's married to three different women in three parallel tracks. Confused ? Mystified ? I certainly was.And then, near the end, we're given an explanation for what happened. But this explanation doesn't make any sense. The sophistication of the worlds we're presented with is way beyond the ability of any child, no matter how precocious. And herein lies, I believe, the fundamental flaw to this movie. Interesting things happen simultaneously in three parallel tracks, to the protagonist, but by the end, one pivotal scene pretty much negates everything that happened earlier in the movie. The deeply flawed and nearly incomprehensible story eclipsed the movie's special effects and excellent technical elements.",4,2,6,5 April 2014
Lincoln," incredibly boring
","Before I saw this movie, I actually had already read the 944 page book, 'Team of Rivals' by Doris Kearns Goodwin, that the movie was purportedly based on. I actually enjoyed the book immensely and was actually regretful when I had turned the last of the book, because there were no more pages to be read.So, I started watching this movie with great anticipation. And was utterly shocked at how slow and boring it was. Daniel Day Lewis seemed off, like he was acting with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn't seem anything like the Lincoln I saw portrayed in Goodwin's biography. To be fair, he was probably basing his performance on the screenplay, which was most likely a horse of a different color.After watching it for an excruciatingly LONG 15-20 minutes, I finally gave up with a mixture of disbelief, sorrow and disgust. disbelief, because I couldn't believe that Spielberg actually directed such a poor movie. sorrow, because I had hoped for a faithful translation to the screen. and disgust, that the screenwriter did such a lousy job of translating the fidelity of the book. This was probably one of the most excruciatingly boring movies I have ever watched.",1,2,6,9 June 2015
Brave," excellent animation, but muddled and mediocre story
","Frankly, I'm shocked that this won the Oscar for best animated feature or was even nominated. The story was fairly muddled and mediocre. Part of it involves the Queen forcing her daughter to marry against her will. To me this is a no brainer -- when you force someone to marry against their will, you're basically creating an untenable situation for them. It's not rocket science.. And it all goes downhill from there. When you put someone into this type of situation, it isn't called love, it's called imprisonment. At this point, I felt antipathy for the Queen and thought she was being totally unreasonable. The graphics and animation are excellent, but for some reason, I found it hard to really get into the story much at all. Maybe because the story was such a yawner -- it wasn't that interesting or compelling.If I were to grade the story on a letter scale (A-F), I would give it a D. D for dumb, misguided, muddled and uninteresting.",4,2,4,27 February 2013
The Imitation Game," not true to the book
","When I first watched it, I thought it was pretty good. Then, I read the book upon which it was supposedly based and was fairly surprised in a negative way. Aside from the names being the same, the screenplay seems to have taken a left turn into fantasy and fiction. 1. Hugh Alexander would never have punched Alan Turing and did not have cause to punch him. 2. Alan never called the descrambling machine 'Christopher'.3. Turing's boss, Denniston, was not actively trying to get rid of him -- that would have been pretty insane of him to even try, given the value of Alan's intellectual genius. 4. It was not a case of Alan's smart approach versus everyone else's stupid, brute force approach -- that's fairly insulting to the rest of the cryptanalytic group who were generally extremely bright and talented as well. 5. Alan did *not* take over leadership of the cryptanalytic group from Hugh Alexander -- interestingly, Hugh, due to his superior management and people skills, eventually took over the group from Alan (which was probably for the best, since Alan was not really suited to head the department). So the idea of Alan taking over the group from Hugh was a complete and utter fiction.6. Although Alan liked to work alone and, in that sense, was a loner, socially, he was fairly gregarious and had numerous friends and friendly acquaintances. This is, of course, quite different from the movie/screenplay, which rather depicts as a guy with fairly poor social skills and a bit of a loner.I realize that a screenplay, can, at best, be a condensed version of the book. But, in this case, it looks to me like the screenwriter butchered the story. Basically, the screenwriter copied the names and a few facts and then constructed an elaborate fiction which bears little/no resemblance to what actually happened. And this makes me suspect that the screenwriter may have simply skimmed the original book, instead of actually reading it. The screenplay is just so off and so inaccurate, it's laughably wrong.",6,11,14,12 May 2015
