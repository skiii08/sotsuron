The Avengers," What a cheesy movie.
","I am not a fan boy and have very little knowledge in the history of the characters. But it seemed to me like a real hodgepodge of mismatched heroes and no real problem in the movie. Thor cant die, hes a God. Iron Man is sort of impenetrable. The Hulk cant die. Captain America is just a douche bag the entire movie. Why start saving like 5-10 innocent people when the entire world is at stake? I really didn't feel this movie or the heroes. Scarlett Johansen at least made some sense in this gang of totally invincible heroes as she had some brain at least. (not to say iron man didn't but he also has tons of firepower) The one really astonishing actor in this movie was Loki he really made a realistic and hate able characther. A movie worth watching just for him.",1,5,11,4 April 2013
The Hurt Locker," Boring and tasteless
","It is the kind of movie that people who loves dull, inaccurate and artsy movies love. The movie is supposed to be realistic, but gives little to no real picture of the strict hierarchy in the US military. It seems like the author thinks that Bagdad is a playground, where a guy with a 9 mm gun is dangerous. They would have popped his ass long before walking around the corner. And why are they always 3 guys driving around? Clearly a war movie made by a person not familiar to war. Also Jeremy Renner is a bad actor, you really don't feel that he is a person in the action, just a guy trying to act. He shows no real emotion and the script does not help his shallow acting skills either. Its beyond me what all the hype about this movie was, It was not worth watching. Three thumbs down.",1,5,7,30 September 2013
