Alien 3," terrible - it trashes the movie 'Aliens'
",Just a horrible movie if you liked 'Aliens' (Alien 2). This movie starts out by saying all the heroics and sacrifice in Aliens was a waste of time. This movie starts out by killing the surviving space marine and little girl from Aliens.  Why was that necessary? Beyond that there is a big plot hole in that this all is necessary to get an Alien to be used as some kind of weapon. In 'Aliens' we saw that a platoon of human space Marines could kill off hundreds of the creatures with limited weapons. A simple shotgun was enough to kill one. So why go through all that trouble?  But putting that aside there are still other problems. The action takes place on a prison planet where the convicts were given the choice to leave or stay but this group volunteers to stay due to a new religion. However within minutes of seeing Sigourney Weaver most of the staff turn into rapists. Huh?  If they wanted a woman that bad why did they stay behind?  Sigourney hops into bed with the local doctor which would to her have been about the day after the events in 'Aliens' took place.  Why was that?  If you set aside all that it still boils down to people with bare hands in a dark setting against an Alien predator. It was done before and better in the original 'Alien'. This is a waste of time and energy.,2,485,521,19 August 2002
Ali," Hard to believe but they made Ali a boring movie
","Some great parts - the 1st fight with Sonny Liston, the fight scenes with Joe Frazier, but too many long scenes of Will Smith looking pensive while dramatic music is playing.  They put in several of his wives and with each there was a sudden jump from Ali being in love to apparently losing all respect for them. I love Ali the man and the boxer but it was hard to sit still for this movie. After starting it and turning it off several times I had to force myself to make it through an entire viewing. After a great first 15 minutes there are occaisonal high points but mostly it's bore-ring.",3,1,1,14 March 2003
United 93," Good, but not really just about united 93
","The movie was good, I did enjoy it. I was expecting a movie about the people on the United 93 flight with some small parts about what was going on in the rest of the country. What it turned out to be was a movie about the air traffic controllers, local, military, and national who were struggling to try to understand what was happening. The parts of the actual united 93 flight seemed almost tacked on. It did make me want to read more about what happened there, specifically about the people on board. A couple of the passengers really had just a few minutes to figure out what was going on an come up with a plan. Who were they? What had they done in their lives that suggested that type of character? The most moving parts were the brief scenes of a few of the people calling home - it seemed most got answering machines - to say good bye. I assume they only showed those that got answering machines because then they got the actual words being spoken. It was almost a documentary with regard to the air traffic controllers as many of them were not actors. It's a movie I would encourage everyone to see, just don't come in with an expectation that you will learn even the identities of the people on board the flight.",7,1,4,2 May 2006
Empire of the Sun," Another Spielberg wonder-kid
","On the plus side - the movie is great to look at. Some of the images created are very good, a simple one with a Mustang pilot waving for example. Malkovitch is very good but that's his usual. Has he ever given a bad performance? So there are a couple of good things going for it. On the bad side, Spielberg just can't resist making the 14 year old boy the wonder-kid, who can through a crowd and without stopping for a breath, immediately understands how to defuse a potentially deadly situation with some guards. The adults just stand around while the kid doesn't need to think. Sorry but this type of thing just detracts from the movie. It's the kind of movie you want to lose yourself in, forgetting you are watching a movie - then somethings like that are thrown in and you are jarred awake, oh yeah this is just Spielberg being Spielberg. It's funny how the kids are so smart in his movies, at one point do 14 year old boys become stupid adults? When do you lose your spark of intelligence? I know, this is a bit overstated but it's like Peter Pan in a Japanese prison camp, it just doesn't fit.",3,11,22,25 September 2006
Saving Private Ryan," I don't understand the hype
","I am a big fan of WWII movies and was looking forward to this movie. I had heard so many great things about it. I was very disappointed. The actual photography and special effects were great. The actions of the people involved to make little sense. The opening at Normandy was well done but I didn't understand mixing the humor with the gore. But it was good at showing the brutality. Now the men at the center of the action were experienced soldiers. We see them using their wits in using mirrors to look around corners, not exposing them selves to enemy fire, etc. Everything is fine. Then comes the set up, trying to find the one private in the sea of humanity. Okay, so they look and finally find him. Now the logic seems to completely desert the men and they act so stupid which is a complete 180 from how they acted at the start of the movie. If they had no combat experience that is one thing but to start the movie showing how smart they are, then wind up the way they did just was too much for me.Okay, I accept the decision to stay and fight for no real good reason because things like that happen. But then they start running out in front of tanks, stand still while tanks point their guns at them, sit on their butts when they run out of ammo, and to not even try to find out where the bridge was in relation to the army? As it turns out if they had not lured the Germans into their 'trap' their fighters and the whole column would have been up to deal with them without any pointless fighting. Okay well that could have been a stupid decision but to have the men act they didn't have a clue about war, they didn't just go through the brutality of the invasion, was just so contrived it was too much for the suspension of believe normally called for.I really don't understand why so many people liked it. It seems like the fact that Spielberg directed it gives in an extra 4 points. Obviously I am in the minority here. Maybe I watched too many episodes of 'Combat' growing up and my expectation were too high.",3,1,4,13 July 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Can't believe Ratner did this!!!
","Jean Grey kills Scott Summers?? Does Ratner know any thing about the X-men comic? Why did they let some one who doesn't know the characters direct this? So would he have had Superman kill Lois Lane? How about Scarlet blow Rett's brains out? Then she kills Professor X? I can't understand what the thinking is here? If he had Lord of the Rings he would have had Frodo kill Sam and Gandalf. As for the rest of the movie it did not make much more sense. Why did they have the boy completely unguarded? There were a couple hundred guards but none with the boy. Why didn't the army think to have sniper rifles to target the main mutants? I really really felt let down. I just don't understand why they would destroy a franchise like this. Maybe Ratner can have James Bond kill M and Q, then receive a pardon from the PM just as the president seems to have pardoned the mutants. What a terrible, terrible, waste of time, money, and opportunity. I hope Ratner retires with his millions and never directs again!!!!!",1,3,6,30 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I was disappointed
","After seeing the movie I am astounded by the number of people rating this a '10'. The last 5-10 minutes were good when everything was being wrapped up but before that, I was having a hard time maintaining interest. For the sake of drama all the high Jedi's weren't able to tell who the Sith lord was in the 1st 2 movies and that doesn't change here even though he is right in their laps. Beyond that I didn't have any problems with the plot as it fit into the logic that exists in the star wars universe. If this was the actually first movie I might have appreciated more but the ending is a foregone conclusion so there is really no tension about what the possible outcome is.I didn't find the CGIs particularly well done and that was a disappointment. Quantity wise there are a lot but quality, it seemed they were a little too in love with CGIs. There is still a lot to be said of using real objects in some cases versus everything created 2 dimensionally. Yoda in particular seemed not very well done, he seemed very flat. I think they made a mistake in the clone war movie (the previous installment) when Count Dooko wasn't even breathing hard when he fought Yoda to a standstill and got away clean. I had just thought Yoda should be above the level of others but this movie re-enforces the fact that he is not.I might watch it again when it comes on HBO but I won't pay to see it again.",4,2,4,26 May 2005
Casino Royale," plenty of action but too many plot holes
","From the write ups on this movie I was thinking it was going to be closer to the novels. It looks like it started out that way but they wound up putting in so many holes into the plot in order to have a particular action scene they lost me. Some big and some small. Here are some examples: 1. Bond kills the suspected bomber in the African embassy then blows it up. Next action but at the start of the scene they made a point of saying they wanted the guy alive. Why couldn't Bond just get out then try to pick him up again later? This one is a small point and could be written off as poor judgment or maybe he didn't want him alive so badly after all. It would seem that he was a lot closer to escaping earlier in the sequence and Bond never thought about shooing him then.2. The top bomber was being hired to drive a gasoline truck into a parked airplane? And a giant airplane to boot? Why did that need a top agent? I think the people in Iraq have shown it doesn't take a lot of skill to deliver a car bomb. If they wanted a top guy couldn't he have used a rocket or a remotely controlled vehicle? It seems to have been done this way just for the Indiana Jones type fight in the truck cab.3. A big one - the CIA was going to pick up Mr One Eye. Felix Leiter tells Bond it's set. The next thing we know Mr One Eye is not only free from the CIA but has his crew of thugs able to kidnap people and take them away without any CIA tail. I guess you could write this off to incompetence on the part of the CIA but that is pretty bad. I had a real problem with this.4. One-eye wants both the bank code and the password so needs the woman and Bond alive. However they leave the woman in the road where Bond could run over her and or kill himself in a crash getting out of the way. It made for a nice scene but a few minutes later when we found out the bad guys needed them alive it made no sense at all. The whole point was to get the account number and password, if one or both of them were dead how would they be able to get the money??5. Bond is being tortured and at the last second the old man with the gun comes in and blows One-eye away. So the old man can track down the bad guys but Felix Leiter is still back asleep in the hotel? Okay so the CIA is incompetent but why did the old man kill one-eye so quickly? The airplane bomb-plot just failed a few days ago and rather than wait to see if one-eye can come up with the money he is just killed outright? What is the point of that? It's obvious that the old man doesn't have any trouble tracking down one-eye so why not at least try to get the money back? If the old man wanted the girl to give him the money that is okay but why let one-eye off the hook? If the money is that important why not break one of his legs or something. I don't think many loan sharks would stay in business if they killed someone the 1st time they said they asked for a few days extension. 6. So right after Bond goes through hell the girl decides to screw him over because someone (the old man?) has kid napped her old boy friend? At this point she didn't trust Bond enough to let him try to help? MI-5 sent her on this mission with $15 million and she was being blackmailed? So they are incompetent too? And their man on the scene turned as well? Or did Bond screw that up? Between the CIA and the MI-5 screw ups you have to wonder what is the point? It seemed like I was back in the Roger Moore days by the end of the movie. Daniel Craig was good but I really don't think James Bond should be the sort of man that goes to the gym to work on his pecs. I thought he would look with disdain on puffer body builders.",4,26,49,18 December 2006
The Deer Hunter," It sucks
","A bunch of 35 year old men decide to quit their jobs, join the army in order to fight in Viet Nam. All wind up in the same Army outfit. All are somehow captured.  Lucky enough to survive a game of 50-50 Russian roulette and escape. If you can swallow all that then I guess you will think it's a good movie.  If a movie is a fantasy like Star Wars I will cut them some slack. If it's supposed to be a serious-message movie at least try to base it in the real world. Maybe the message was too deep for me.",2,17,31,25 February 2003
