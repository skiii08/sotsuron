The Incredible Hulk," political correctness
","This is the most politically correct action film of the last 5 years. There is no story. The American army is evil. All the villains are men who wear medals and ribbons. It is an anti American film to the extreme. They throw in a British army villain because they Hollywood liberals hate the fact that we are allies with London.No adventures here in this film. Scene after scene of hospital stuff and close ups of bruises. If you like medical scenes than this is the film for you. The film goes down hill fast after a decent Brazil opening. It is obvious that the film is anti military and wastes our time. We thought the new film would not waste so much time on medical stuff like the one a few years ago. This one is worse.We also get the soap opera father daughter problems. The female lead is a phony sickening sweet annoying person. I seldom criticize female leads but this one is terrible. Lines like 'its OK, I like it' and her switch from sweetness to her profanity laced tirade against a cab driver are pathetic. She condescends constantly and has an air of knowing all things which is horrible. My least favorite lead in a decade. The best part of the film was Ed Norton's acting and a decent fight scene at the end. Not enough. The television show was so good and had meaning. The villains are wimps and all soldiers are portrayed as evil or stupid. I am sure that people in other countries will believe that the American Army is truly evil. This is a shame when our real soldiers are nothing like this. This empty hate America film is depressing. Hulk is my least favorite film of last three years.",1,14,37,17 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," psychobabble, just don't listen too closely to the dialogue
","(mild spoiler) This film had great cinematography and fine acting. The bare story had great promise which is a rancher trying to get a slick outlaw to the train to prison with a gang of outlaws hunting them. The film starts great with a stagecoach robbery with Gatling gun verses outlaws. Unfortunately, the film turns to soap opera. We must endure scene after scene listening to motivations and psychological analysis. This film must have been written by doctors or social workers.The wife and family are a very unfriendly bunch to the father. He is blamed for not making enough money and a missing leg. With friends like these you don't need enemies. All the characters turn out to be no so good. Even the hero father seems to be saying he is just trying to set an example for his son or even just trying to impress his family. He ultimately blames the US government for his problems with his old war wounds. Even the actions of the boy made no sense near the end. This was in a sense an anti war western,So much of the violence is gratuitous with graphic for the sake of graphic. Unlike Apocolypto or 300, there is absolutely no reason for the graphic closeups other than to say the world is brutal. Why some viewers believe redemption in any film is out of place is beyond me. This film has little of any point. Change and twisted new ideas just to be different does not improve film. This movie is better if you don't listen too closely. This film had potential but fails.",1,6,11,23 September 2007
United 93," Sold less tickets than the revolting RV
","It is a sad day when United 93 sold less tickets than true garbage RV (which was another self hating America's attack on itself.) Flight 93 is not selling very many tickets and shows what a short memory so many people have. This is why I give it only 2 stars because it is not being given the sales by Americans.This men and women were heroes in the truest sense. This film is tough, tight, but very respectful to the people of that monumental day in world history. I have read the Todd Beamer story called Lets Roll which is a great book about one of the passengers who was heard saying 'lets roll' on a cell phone just before a major incident in the movie. The movie though is about all the passengers and also covers other events of that day. Also, I took my 11 year old to see it and I believe she was old enough for the film. There was a little swearing and the violence fit in to the story. Certainly a parent could have their kids look away during a few moments of violence if they wanted too but I did not need to.This film is extremely important and should be seen by everyone. Lets start taking kids to the right films. She remembered 911 and she was only 7 at that time. Now she understands it far more. By the way her best friends are Arab and this movie is not anti Arab but it is clearly anti terrorist. It does portray passengers as heroes which they truly were.",1,12,49,3 May 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," New low
","This film finds a new rock bottom. The theater was unfortunately full. The buzz from this film was very effective in bringing millions of people to spend money on this film. How do slime films like this manage to make so many people between fifteen and twenty five think they have to see it. This film is full of gross stuff that is degrading to the audience and degrading to this country. Of course, it will also degrade worldwide audiences.This terrible streak of nasty, gross, immoral, and despicable comedies began around the time of the sleazy American Pie. This idea of comedy is to keep pushing the envelope further and further into absolute decadence. Hollywood has convinced movie viewers that each one of these movies is extremely important to see. But these films are worthless. The bottom has fallen out in film comedy and sleaze and bad taste is now the norm. Comedy has now become a tragedy.Occasionally a comedy is decent like Drillbit Taylor. In general, Hollywood thinks that we are sleazy idiots. This is surely the darkest review I have written. But this film has hit rock bottom. A reviewer once stated that comedy allows Hollywood lowlife to push garbage more than any other genre. It wont be long before Hollywood release another destructive film.",10,6,16,21 April 2008
The Last Song," good
","Don't like any of the Hanna Montana songs or her early career. So went to this film expecting the worst. the film actually turned out well. Not a chick flick but more of a drama. Miley Cyrus did a pretty good job considering her goofy early dramatic and music work designed for popular appeal to certain kids. This film is actually interesting with good acting by the brother, father and the rest of the cast.This film had an interesting story and is the kind of film I would not have even gone to had there been anything in the theater I had not already seen. it actually could be liked by any age. I, personally, think that Miley Cyrus may change direction in her career. She recently took her real fathers name in an official name change. I expect that Miley will not follow in the footsteps of other Disney losers like Britney Speers and Lindsay Lohan. This film is a step in the right direction but her recent American Idol appearance was pretty bad. The film is worth seeing.",9,7,14,30 April 2010
The Town," You are suppose to like it overrated
","This is one of those films that you are suppose to like. There is a buzz going around that tells everyone this is a good film. There a quite a few brutal scenes. And a couple of love scenes which are quick and well these are boring people in that department. All of the characters are mean in one way or another. The lead actress seems like she has a sinus condition. The acting is suppose to be great and dramatic but not in the same planet as Shutter Island acting wise.There is a lot of meanness which doubles as realism. Johhny'y Depp's Dillinger film was far more interesting. In this film the bad guys almost are suppose to be good but they still are quite mean. Of course we have graphic scenes of where people are shot or close ups of beatings. That is the new realism. In the end there seems to be no point. It is in some ways TV like. Shows such as the Sopranos dwell on psychology and soap opera stories. Even the vaunted God Father was mostly talk. These films are not in the same league as the old Jimmy Cagney, Bogart, George Raft gangster films. Affleck is not in the same league as DI Caprio or Johnny Depp.This film is way overrated.",5,5,11,25 September 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," great action, solid film, wrong villain
","(There may be a mild spoiler later in the review.) This film has superior action sequences. It is a return to the gritty action of From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and the French Connection only in this film it is non stop. The fight between Bourne and an assassin is very similar to the great briefcase fight scene in the classic Bond film: Russia With Love.Some people have complained that the action makes them dizzy or disoriented. But in a real car chase the riders would be dizzy. The film and camera work are fantastic.The only weakness in this film may be the villains. U. S. government agents are the ones chasing Bourne. Although this film may clarify that these U.S. government agents that are chasing Bourne are rogue agents, it also has many regular agents involved. In real life I am sure many agents would begin to question orders although there is a slight moment of truth late in this film in regards to that.It is a fact that the best and brightest in our society join national security agencies, the C.I.A., the F.B. I. and the military. The finest minds and physically trained men and women join to protect you and this country.One good point that can be derived from the film is that in a democracy and republic like ours, we have an open society. Even spy methods, interrogation techniques and and procedures can be discussed in the wide open in which the the whole society is aware of controversies. For example the discussion in our society of whether terrorist should be given Geneva conventions even when these terrorists have killed entire schools of children, beheaded reporters and murdered red cross workers is a wide open discussion. This film does not enter anything heavy like this but it does touch on the subject.One more thing about the villains. In the real world the C.I.A. probably has more of a problem with left wing infiltration in which the CIA is made to be downsized and less effective and believes we have no enemies. Of course America has many enemies and 911 was not another American Government conspiracy. In real life terrorists in the Middle east, Africa, Asia, and South America prey on the innocent. The Bourne story ignores this. This film is more like James Bond in which Bond's own British secret service is after him. Hopefully there will be a sequel in which freedom's real enemies who are terrorists and thugs and warlords who are the villains. Hopefully, the sequel will be as well made as this film.All and ail this film has the feel of From Russia with Love and the classic Michael Caine film Ipcress File.",6,1,4,18 August 2007
The Last Legion," Honor
","Excellent film. In the league of 300. This film had a great story line that is historical. It shows the ending of the Roman empire but the legacy of that empire. This is not the roman empire of the Jesus's time but 400 years later. Sure it is a legend but that is the whole point. This shows the beginning of Great Britain and the attack of the Goth barbarians from the North. It is against tyranny.This film is a great action film that is really about courage, honor, loyalty and bravery. It is that simple. It is driven by the story and has very little gore but plenty of action. It is like a classic Errol Flynn swashbuckler but modern film making. The acting by Colin Firth is not wooden it is steady and shows a real man of great honor instead of whiny self hating nerds. The boy is great. the supporting cast is strong and Ben Kingsley takes acting to a high level. The film can be seen by any age. It would not be liked to much by the jaded, anti-American anti-western civilization types who giggle like babies and are obsessed with politically correct issues. It is old fashioned adventure with themes of honor which make it timeless. A main character says the most important thing is 'seeking truth.' Good point.",10,6,12,18 August 2007
Watchmen," mean, awful soap opera
","This film is a mean film pretending to be a comic book movie. This long movie seems like it will never end. All of the characters become unlikable except for possibly Rorschack. This film is a violent soap opera. Obviously this fits into the hate America films completely. I will just mention a few of the bad points. The North Vietnamese are portrayed as victims of America and those scenes come straight out of the North Vietnamese propaganda films that the North Vietnamese released during the war. Of course, in real life, soon after the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, millions of people were slaughtered by the North Vietnamese. This movie may pretend to be conservative at moments but that will only affect those who do not know why they are conservative. The movie is anti everything to the core. This film has scene after scene of having to look at one of the main characters naked. The other characters are mostly jerks. The film is unrelentingly depressing with not one moment of real action or adventure. The only action is just brutal gore. One unfortunate growing trend in some films is to show good guys with flaws. To basically say that good guys do not exist is to say that nothing really means anything. It is the opposite of what Americans have believed for centuries. It is a mental head game. In many ways it just celebrates darkness and makes everyone weaker. This film takes this to the utter extreme. These good guys are killers, rapists, impotent. or weird. It makes you want to run from the head games of this film. There is nothing real here. It is just one big dark head game. Stop the head games and get real.The one good line comes from when one of the characters put into prison with convicts he was responsible for having arrested says 'I am not trapped in here with them, they are trapped in here with me.' One line in almost three hours of a boring violent, misleading, depressing and pointless film. This film is the opposite of The Dark Knight. That film had moments of darkness but was a good film. Watchman is dark with nothing else to it. Scene after scene of undressed people, love scenes, soap opera mentality, boredom, and moronic moments make this in my top twenty worst movies list.",3,7,15,9 March 2009
Over the Hedge," left wing hatred of humans
","Again we have a politically correct film that attacks humans and must really play head games with the kids watching. After all, kids are human and everyone they know is human. It must blow them away to watch the human race be attacked and hated and made to look like total jerks. what are we doing to these children. Put yourself in their place. This is total madness. Suburban parents march their kids off to one politically correct film after another. At least Ice Age was a little better than most. Curious George had no agenda and was super. But Over the Hedge was agenda driven. It is full of contempt for people. I walked out with my daughter after the praying to food scene. Don't be a sheep. Dump these left wingers and their insanity.",10,3,11,1 June 2006
Salt," audience cheered
","If you are looking for total realism stand at a bus stop for two hours. It's free. Seriously, I remember one of some well known critic's favorite films was of watching someone paint a painting for three hours. If you are looking for a film that is more James Bond than James Bond with a little Bourne thrown in then see Salt. But you will have to wait and see how this film turns out and who the real heroes are. The film is nothing like Shutter Island or Inception which were good but were psychological and mind bending films and are not thrillers. It is certainly nothing like Toy Story either which is a kid's film. There is no point to try and compare it to films that are not in the same genre. This is not a film for people preoccupied with gender, age, always trying to make a new concept or other things. It is a film full of imagination and excitement. It is great to see a film directed with no CGI. It is just done better, more interesting and was a surprise. Also, It is also interesting that a major Russian spy ring was broken up in the US this last month.Jolie starts slowly and picks up speed like a railroad train. She is the best actress, hands down, of the era with films like this, Changeling, Mighty Heart and Beyond Borders. Jolie could get nominated for this film. She is completely versatile and pulls viewers with imagination into her films perhaps the best in Hollywood history over her career. Amazingly there is a major physical appearance change she makes in the film that I believe even her physical appearance at the Hollywood premiere was supposed to be slightly deceptive and made the movie physical change even more interesting. There was a point where I noticed early in the film that Jolie's face seemed so much slimmer than usual and not her usual self. After a scene regarding teeth, you will be surprised at a physical appearance change, . Then there was even another change later in the film. The film rocks and rolls and is quite the opposite of the image of mindless American girls on their cell phones 24/7 who have no individuality. In reality, this is an inspiring action packed performance. There is so much depth to her character, intensity, mystery, and excitement. It is written that way but only Jolie can bring it to life.A subtle look from Jolie can mean so much. I believe it is Jolie's intelligence, knowledge of world affairs, and experience in foreign countries and war zones in real life that allows her to be so much more intense and interesting than most actors.Great action thriller. The director did not feel the need to try and be falsely realistic by forcing lots of awkward swearing, pointless disturbing images or other phony realism that many modern films put in. This is not an art film, it is an action film, and an excellent one. Don't know if there will actually be a sequel. It had an exciting ending and could have kept going. It certainly could have a good sequel. I expected a lot going in and it was great. There is also a fine supporting cast. It is worth seeing on a full screen. I am not going to give away any twists and turns for those who have not seen this excellent movie. Man, it was like being there.",10,19,38,25 July 2010
The Butterfly Effect," 14 nose bleeds
",If you like 30 second closeups of nosebleeds then this movie is for you.  If you like dogs being burned this film is for you.  If you like babies being blown up this is for you.  Or possibly gross homo activity in prison is for you.  We also have a 400 pound lover  boy and a child porn pedophile dad.  This film is disgusting beyond belief.  The plot might have been good if we were not forced to witness one graphic disgusting scene after another.  This film is hateful of all things and fits right in with the sick super bowl half time show.  Will it ever end.  Thankfully I was alone this day cause it would have been embarrassing to be sitting by my wife or anyone else and we surely would have left.,2,6,18,3 February 2004
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," never forget
","Accidentally or not, this film is not about lost innocence. It is terribly tragic, sad and even depressing but it is not about lost innocence. It in many ways celebrates innocence in the most horrible of circumstances. Whether that is what the writer intended, I do not know. But that is the result. I had life long studies of the Holocaust. This is certainly an excellent film concerning the Holocaust. The goodness of the characters is stunning amid the horrible darkness of the Holocaust. Both children retain there innocence through every moment of the film and even hold hands at the worst. They play and have fun no matter what the circumstances. They don't need money, cell phones, video games, big houses or mountains. They have they innocence and imagination that all people are meant to have. This is clear in the scene in which one of the boys is offered a chance to leave the area. He refused to leave. This seemed to bewilder some of the people in the audience. But the boy had a great friend and had great fun on a daily basis with his friend. He refused to even consider leaving to go back to his great world in a nice city or anywhere else. This reminds me of the way kids can play in the worst refugee camps in the world and still have fun. It is not how long you live but what is in a person's heart that matters. This is another deep meaning of this film.There are a number of fine people in this story who show their goodness as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The worst and best of humanity is often seen in real life in war or genocide. The mother is a fine woman who rejects her husband's involvement in the Holocaust. The Grandmother is another who rejects the evil philosophy of the Holocaust. Pavel is a very good man as the slave houseman and shows incredible decency. In contrast, we see the worst in human nature in the father who is the commandant of the death camp. Also the immature and pure mean young Nazi soldier is a cruel man. This film also illustrates the importance of empathy, sympathy and the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes. There is also the 12 year old daughter. The 12 year old daughter is copy cat entirely brainwashed by Nazi propaganda. She is the utter opposite of the historical figure Ann Frank. Even this girls affection for the mean Nazi soldier is nothing like the genuine affection by Ann Frank of a teen boy in the tremendous old film Diary of Ann Frank. The young German son of the Nazi commandant slowly comes to terms with the evil system of the Nazi's. He is, in effect, an 8 year old member of the German resistance without even knowing it. He also has the ability to know when he is wrong in the scene in which he apologizes to the inmate boy for not telling the truth about something to the mean soldier because of fear. He is also blessed with the ability to see truth. His young rationality allows him to see through the lies that Jews are somehow not human. He comes to see that his father is consumed by evil. Yet, he balances his enthusiasm with truth. We also, see the great respect the prisoner boy has for his own father. Power, status, and money mean nothing to these children.Ultimately, this film is terribly tragic. It reminded me of Anne Frank who was a real life person who maintained her strong heart in the midst of terrible circumstances. It is this belief that sustains good verses evil. As long as someone believes in this spirit these people were ultimately victorious. The old saying of 'never again' can also include 'never forget' these individual people who had so many tragic stories and so many moments confronting incredibly powerful evil forces.",9,7,13,16 December 2008
Prisoners," a good film
","I first must say I am going to give a major spoiler later in this review but I will try and keep that a little vague. I seldom put spoilers in reviews but this film is complex and I must bring up the turn of events. As far as acting goes this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film. He is excellent throughout and the most human person in the film. His character is certainly who I identified with. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting progressed and was superior in the last part of the film.This is certainly not a liberal film and not conservative either. The ending was clear and I do not see any ambiguousness in the ending either. It was obvious what was happening in the last 30 seconds. Further even the small comment early in the film about being against deer hunting when we sit around eating hamburgers at McDonald's with industrialized slaughter to feed millions is absolutely a good point about society's hypocrisy. But I don't want to deviate from the plot. This was just one tiny early sentence in the film.I do believe the film could have been just as good with a little less brutality. I am especially referring to the water part which was not needed. In the middle I wasn't sure if I would like the film. But ultimately I would say it was a top film. The acting and the story was fine. The religious angle actually changed as the film played out. Now for a major spoiler. Who would ever believe that the priest may actually have been correct? Was this a war against God? I will say no more about that. Ultimately, this film could not be entirely judged to be dark. Certainly the cop was intense and believable. There was some deserved justice delivered even for the brutality. Although the legal penalties were not reached and i will leave that vague. The final 10 minutes was riveting. And even some fast car scenes were very effective because of the depth of the plot. i have tried to be somewhat vague for those who have not yet seen the film. And the ending was very clear to me.",8,2,5,21 September 2013
The Dark Knight," Bad Expectations
","I went to Dark Knight expecting the worst. I had read on this site that this film was overwhelmingly dark, negative and depressing. Many reviewers acted like they liked the film because it is so dark and pessimistic. I personally don't like dark films. I loved Journey to the Center of the Earth and rank that as the best film of this year as well as a Chinese orphan film and the under rated Kit Kitredge. But II hate pointless and depressing stuff like The Sopranos and I never liked The Godfather series because they were boring and dark with dead horses being major moments. Its true that Dark Knight has been ranked higher than The Godfather, Citizen Cane and Apocalypse Now. But those films were terribly over rated. You want great mobster films than check out Cagney's White Heat or Angels with Dirty faces or Humphrey Bogart's great gangster films not modern soap opera mobster films like Bugsy.This Dark Knight was hyped to be gory and grim so I almost did not go. The first 30 minutes of the film did have some gratuitous violence and I would have cut a few of the Joker's violent attacks but the film survives that. The great film Rambo is far more gory. The beginning of the film seems more like a mobster and crime film than an action film but that is OK. But then the film seemed to build. In my opinion this is not a film about flawed heroes or that good and evil does not exist.It is really a film that is about Batman against the Joker. The joker is truly evil. The film has very little psycho babble. At first the Joker explains that his evil father is why he grew up to be evil. But later we see that the Joker is a chronic liar with a different lie about his ex-wife and cannot be analyzed. The Joker's past is not important. The Joker (also called the clown) exists to destroy the world. He also exists to change good people into bad people. Everyone has encountered the kind of people who want to change you in real life. Each one of us has had to deal with people like the Joker.But who will go bad. Will Batman go bad? Who will go bad? Remember Anakin went bad in Star Wars. This film is essentially about endurance against evil. The acting in this film is excellent. The supporting roles with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are excellent. These are the two finest character actors of out time. Michael Caine has been around a long time dating back to his early films: The Ipcress File and No Time for Heroes. The other actors did fine. The female lead was fine and not as bad as some reviewers say. Ledger did a great job as the Joker. At times he seemed like the insane Jack Nicholson in the Shining and even Harpo Marx. Batman himself did a fine job. The Batman series has been OK for me but not in my top movies. This Batman is far superior to the others.Batman and Bruce Wayne are both interesting characters and better than the wimpy Iron Man when he was not Iron Man. The special effects also work and the Bat Bike would work great in James Bond. The ending works but as some have mentioned the last few seconds could have been after the credits. This is a surprising Thumbs up for Batman, The Dark Knight. The person with me mentioned that the music from the Batman TV series should have been played. That would have been a good thing to put in the credits at the end. This is a surprising thumbs up for Batman, The Dark Knight putting it in my top five films of the year.",10,4,9,24 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," gory, innocence gone, adventure gone, soap opera not for kids
","I have always been a fan of star wars and star trek. It started to slip in clones because it was too soap opera like. This one is extremely dark and all the adventure is gone. We get to see a disgusting scene in which Anakin is burned and mutilated going on and on.The coughing cancer victim bad guy is quite revolting and the closeups of dead woman is nasty. We have reached a new low with Anakin's slaughter of children and of course we see the dead children's bodies.This is not for kids or the young at heart. Obviously Lucas has gotten old and jaded and it shows. I only give high ratings for special effects and great music which divert from this dark film, not at all for kids. Go Luke!",10,3,9,31 May 2005
1408," builds
","This is the best scary film since the original Haunting with Julie Harris. At the level of the Ring, Legend of Hell House, the Others and Dark Water. 1408 has its own style and got quite a good reaction from the leaving crowd. The film builds and turns very intense. Some incredible vertigo dizzy scenes and a tremendous mirror scene as well as genuinely scary scenes.The underlying story is excellent and is woven into the plot through the end of the movie. The following sentence is a super spoiler. The last shot and recording that confuses some viewers was brilliant. The recording pounds home that something was real. There may be some other interpretations but I believe it is clear.I highly recommend this film which has no agenda. The film has very little swearing or gore with no love scenes. It is actually OK for most ages and the terror is not brutal or cruel. It is old fashioned scare fest with good acting. Sam Jackson gives his usual good performance in a small role. I only give it one star because the film is so classic and good and seems out of place in the large amounts of trash films recently. This is a great film with a fine ending that is not a set up for a sequel.",1,2,10,10 July 2007
Casino Royale," Bond bad role model, ( with very mild spoiler, no story given away)
","Bond is not a very nice guy in this film. He shoots unarmed people. He goes after married women. Bond laughs or smiles when looking at dead people. The blond hair is not the problem. He seems almost like a villain at times. There is no feeling of adventure in this film. It has too much torture. There is no one to like in this movie. There are no good guys. The two female characters are jerks. one brags about cheating. The other girl is like a feminist psychologist. Her and Bond engage in endless conversation about ego. Yes, ego. Like to much self ego. There are some good action sequences with bond running and wild jumps. There is way too much talk. The last scenes have no action but revolve around death and sadism. This is a film that everyone is mean in. There are no decent people. The villain is pathetic and sad and not a worthy foe. . This is depressing film that has some good action. The best scenes are the card games in the casino. Those are good. All and all, the reason to see the film is if you are a Bond fanatic who wants to see all of the films. This one is by far the darkest.",10,1,4,19 November 2006
Munich," All Nuts
","Let us see here. We have an equal treatment of terrorists who kill olympic athletes and those who hunt terrorists down. We make those who hunt terrorists down seem bad somehow. Why not make a film that puts Hitler on par with his victims of ten million of the Holocaust. Or Charles Manson deserves equal treatment with his victims. Or school bus bombers equal to parents. Political correctness taken to utter madness. The old 911 revision that U.S. just as bad as bin Laden. It never ends. There is no evil? Speiberg throws in a little sex and mixes violence in the oddest creepy way just like Schindlers list. This is the total moral collapse since his great debut Duel. I forgot. Even ET had the U.S. as the bad guys. This is shameful. Weirdos always try and flip the world upside down, just read the reviews. Underline it, people who kill athletes and wear suicide vests are sick monsters, simple. Hitler was a pig and so are these other maniacs.",9,1,6,29 December 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," not bad
","Slumdog millionaire is an interesting film. Apparently the Millionaire show is shown in other countries with different hosts. The film begins in the slums of India and follows the growth of some kids. The center piece and structure of the film revolves around the game show. When the main actor becomes old enough to be on the game show he is not in the extreme poverty of his youth but he is still struggling. The show may be a ticket to a better life. This is a driving force of the film. The viewer gets to see flashbacks and real time scenes but it is not difficult to understand.So much of this film seems to be something i can relate to. Some viewers will find they have more in common with these people from India than they do with some of the middle class Americans portrayed in some comedies. It would be easy to identify with the characters in this film for some people. You will have to decide which character you like the most. There was another fine film made in this area of the world: City of Joy with Patrick Swayze.The characters in this Slumdog Millionaire think out of the box and some present situations to show honor, betrayal, or loyalty. The film is a drama and adventure. Yes the outhouse scene was revolting and the one short gross scene per movie convention is unfortunately in this one too so I will only watch the film once.. But ultimately, this is a very good film and worth seeing. It is appropriate for mature kids.",9,1,3,16 January 2009
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Pig like movie written for pig like mentality.
","This movie is made to make people laugh like pigs oink. I can only say that jokes like 'I spread my butt cheeks' are written to appeal to some imbeciles in the audience. It is sad to see American comedy sink lower every year. This film is slime as is most of what is on comedy channel. The lowest form of human nature and bully mentality is exploited in films like this. I think parents who take their kids to see this are freaks, total moronic freaks, I give it 10 cause it reveals how bad things are. Skip this garbage, for fools only.Enough is enough. Dupree and me was far better. Great comedies like It happened one night, 3 stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Bob Hope, Bill Murray and many others. This one is for freaks.",10,1,4,18 August 2006
