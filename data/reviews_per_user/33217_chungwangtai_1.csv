First Man," Good but not Great
","It found interesting to present Armstrong in this angle. However it should spend more time to build up the relationship between Armstrong and his daughter. Shakey cam is a fun way to present situation inside rocket and plane but it is over use and I cant see the detail. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy did a great job here. All in all, it is a good film to watch but it is not as good as Whiplash and La La Land.",7,0,0,29 October 2018
