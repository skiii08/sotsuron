The Blair Witch Project," Don't insult me with this
",This 'film' has made 300.000% profit and shows us why we all need to be carefull of what critics say.When this 'film' came out it gained huge support from the media for this incredibly low bugeted 'film'.Now don't get me wrong just because a film is low budgeted doesn't make it god awful but the blair witch project has 0 for thought and how on earth the media got away with the push for this 'film' is shocking.This 'film' is meant to be a horror and I honestly couldn't tell from watching.I admit the idea of campers going into a forrest with a cam corder only to get lost and spooked may sound like the ingredients for an average film but what exactly am i suppost to be afraid of? very tame the most unimaginetive script ever. Watching this 'film' I felt like I had been cheated because the script could of been done better by an 8 year old.The script consists of teenagers getting into heated arguments with one another.It's like something you would get from your own family accept your paying to watch it.Sounds wonderful.Finally onto the execution or the lack of it and i'm not going to go deep into it because if i continue to ramble on and on about it then i'll be here on all night but the film seems to pride itself on laziness almost as if it's deliberately laughing at itself and you for that.This 'film' may have fooled people a while back but now it should be revealed and shamed,2,0,3,20 February 2008
Avatar," 3 words: Repetitive Eyestrain Injury
","Synopsis-An Alien planet is under attack by a human corporation who want some resource (no specifics as to why), located in the alien's home land and who are reluctant to move from their natural and mystical habitat so the corporation send a marine in alien form (avatar mode), to reason with the aliens only for the marine to conform with their way of life and join the resistance. You probably know what happens as it's a predictable plot with a ton of clich√©'s.Visuals- Complete and utter pain for your eyes. The 3d glasses makes the screen seem darker and so loses the sharpness of picture and what's worse, gives you a headache because your eyes just can't take the strain, anyway the 3d effects aren't all that impressive. Without the glasses, the graphics are astonishing but because it's intended to be 3d, there is a noticeable blur that is very noticeable.Plot- This is where even a multi million pound budget cannot save a film. The film seems to be split into 2: Avatar mode and Human form. The film switches between the 2 and this is bad because human form is boring and drags the film. Every time there is a high in Avatar mode such as riding dragons; it is killed by the exiting of Avatar form to the tedious human form.The film just doesn't have any substance. If you took away the graphics, then you are left with a very predictable plot (Wall-E?). You know it's inevitable that their will be romance, that the undercover marine will turn sides, that there will be some cheesy deaths to add motive etc. The dialogue would make the pope weep (line from American Movie) the worse easily being 'you're not the only one with guns bitch'...(shudders). There are also parts of the films where only average movies or poor movies would get away with such disbelief i.e. being able to escape from an army base so ridiculously easily.Overall the film is eye candy if your eyes can take the strain but the plot is an equal let down that offers nothing new and is another piece of clutter in the top 250 along with Requiem For A Dream.",1,1,7,1 January 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Entertaining yet forgettable
","Expectations were obviously very high for this following the Dark Knight so putting that aside I've tried to review this objectively as if I hadn't seen the excellent predecessor. Well the performances were all good. Baines voice wasn't as incomprehensible as the backlash from the trailer had made it out to be. He was also a worthy villain for somebody who looks like a bad guy pro wrestler. Hathaway portrays a very credible cat woman and everything is well produced as you would expect from Chris Knolan. So where does it fall down? Well put simply it's pretty forgettable. Seeing the Dark Knight just once I can still recollect many scenes particularly with the Joker. I can remember the body swinging off the window with a thud. I can remember the frightening home made video tape with the Joker and the pencil to the eye. All great stuff. This film I have the feeling that I wont remember anything. There's nothing wrong with it. The pacing is fine, the acting is fine and the story is fine. It's just not that remember-able. The acting scenes are a little bland and some of the dialogue a little pretentious. Despite not reaching the top notes otherwise it's a well shot and entertaining film.",8,1,5,27 July 2012
The Simpsons Movie," 7.8/10 really??
",Well don't get me wrong this is not a bad film but it's clear that fan support flatter the score.I'm a simpsons fan myself and watched the week it came out but despite some luaghs in the cinema it felt polite and out of respect.The jokes are just down right pathetic and just too slapstick trash comedy.The trailer pretty much shows the better ones or the least worse ones anyway.Spider pig? what were they thinking???? and the plot in general was a disappointment reflecting the weaknesses that the show has had in the last seasons.An example of this neglect was Mr Burns easily the most popular non Simpson character and yet he is barely mentioned which is just bizare considering he's a natural villain.On the positive side the animation is amazing and I cant remember the last time seeing a cartoon movie as most seem dominated and flooded by cgi.Overall the film just played flat and a non simpsons fan may be bored as this film struggled to fill the 87 minuites and it shows.,6,1,2,20 February 2008
