Blade Runner 2049," Oh dear...
","What a disappointment, so much hype and, therefore, expectation but this is no more than a competent sci-fi film, certainly not a worthy successor to the original. I could support a 163 minute run time if there was plenty of content but at times it felt like the actors were moving and speaking slowly not for effect, but to fill in the gaps. As for the plot, everything revolved around the ability or otherwise of replicants to breed. If you have the technology to grow a human body from scratch and implant whatever memories you want I'd have thought introducing the mechanics of reproduction wouldn't be difficult. I could go on but really, this film isn't worth the bother.",6,210,392,9 October 2017

","I wasn't going to review this because it's not a film that you can be ambivalent about - you're either going to get it (and by that I don't necessarily mean immediately twigging the whole biblical back story) or you're not. The acting is outstanding and the concept is stunning, but that won't make people like it. I'm hoping that the reviewers on here who thought that this was about a couple living in a house missed the beginning and either left half way through or fell asleep before the end... Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticising the people who don't like this film, but you need to accept that just because you don't like something it doesn't mean that it's bad and that everyone should feel the same way. This film doesn't exploit anyone, and it certainly isn't just another excuse to show violence against women - if you accept that it's allegorical and that mother and the house represent Mother Nature and the planet we live on then the violence makes sense. To sum up, a great film worthy of 10 stars but one that at least half the people that see it are going to hate. It's a pity there isn't a separate Oscars category for the most divisive film, this would win hands down!",10,8,24,16 September 2017
