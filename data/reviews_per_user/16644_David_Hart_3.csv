Casablanca," The best hollywood movie of all-time
","When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, I just say 'Casablanca'. It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to 'I Know Where I'm Going!' which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as 'An Affair to Remember', 'Sleepless in Seattle' and even the most recent animated 'Sinbad' movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or anti-hollywood.",10,6,9,8 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than the second not nearly as good as the first
","This is the most reluctant seven I think I could ever give. The screen play is worth a two, the technical achievements of the movie our worth a ten so the average comes up to a six. I entered seven on the rating but I'll see if can change that. While I comment on this movie it is impossible to talk about this movie without talking about the second Reloaded since they feel like just one movie split into two.Revolutions has some of the most amazing special effects ever made and good performances (with lousy dialog). It also doesn't have the embarrassing rave/sex scene in the second movie.However, it suffers from poor dialog and spending too much time in Zion (a place dreary at best). The dialog seems mostly to be reiterations from the second movie. Unlike others I don't see that free choice is a bad idea concept of basing the movie on, but it never gives a good idealogical reason why free choice is important.The problem of the movie still relates to the dreary design of Zion. Words do mean things and Zion is the mount to where the Temple of Jerusalem was placed; the word Zion also is often used for the Jerusalem and Israel itself. With the technology at their disposal why couldn't Zion seem something like Hobbiton: a true alternative to the dreary Matrix skyscraper world and reality of how the earth now exists. Instead we are given a world that seems inferior the skyscraper construct of the Matrix and makes us think that Cypher's choice in the first movie wasn't illogical while highly immoral.The two Matrix sequels seem to be afterthoughts. Instead of thinking about a world that most people would want to save (Zion) we instead are fed the most basic sort of philosophical ideas and excellent special effects. Characters are given limitations (Oracle and Neo) that seem to just be created so give us a chance to have sequels, not to improve the story. Does anyone think that Neo would seem to be as super-powered as he was if there were a sequel intended?What the creators of the Matrix don't realize is that people fight for what is behind them: their families, friends, towns and country, not what is in front of them. The first Matrix movie could get away from this because we could imagine Zion as a wonderful place. However its reality makes it a much difficult to imagine people wanting to fight for it. There is a scene in this movie where we are drawn into Merovingian's club which seems amazing like the rave scene from Reloaded and you wonder: why do I think that these are the villains and the citizens of Zion as the heroes?A sequel (and there are few) has to give good reasons to why there is  a sequel. Aliens dealt with the problem of all those eggs left on the surface of the planet we saw in Alien. The Godfather II let us see what made Corlone into the monster that we saw in Godfather I. There is no reason that the resolution given in this movie is superior to the original resolution in the original Matrix and that is what makes this movie sad: for it has reduced the importance of the ending of the one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, The Matrix.",6,0,0,6 November 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The worst of the series
","The fight with Agent Smith and flying scenes are amazing. The special effects are wonderful. Now if they only spent more time with the story, the movie would be much better.Dialog is better than the third since the third just reiterates comments from the first. But this movie has to be judged by its three major flaws:1) limitations put on Neo (he doesn't seem as super-powered as as it was suggested in the first movie) 2) the rave/sex scene 3) the dreary design of ZionThe first problem is due to the fact that while ending given at the end of the original Matrix made it sequeable, the problem remains on how do you sequel a movie with the powers that Neo is given. Its the same problem that Superman faced and the results seem as unsatisfying as Superman II but without the comedy. The problem is that Superman always had some limitations (Kryptonite, Magic, etc.) while Neo is given none of these in the first movie. So in order to there to be some conflict, his powers seem to be initially less than in the first.The second problem just is an editing problem. This long scene was unnecessary, makes the Zionites look like just a bunch a hedonists. Contrast that with the first movie's implied view that hedonism was a construct of the Matrix to keep control and a seduction even those who know it is illusion. The violence of the first movie was more of a video game violence and the movie could be shown to children under the age of seventeen with caution. However, it is obvious that this movie should not.However, the third and worse flaw of the movie is design of Zion. Words do mean things and Zion is the mount to where the Temple of Jerusalem was placed; the word Zion also is often used for the Jerusalem and Israel itself. With the technology at their disposal why couldn't Zion seem something like Hobbiton: a true alternative to the dreary Matrix skyscraper world and reality of how the earth now exists. Instead we are given a world that seems inferior the skyscraper construct of the Matrix and makes us think that Cypher's choice in the first movie was immoral but understandable.What the creators of the Matrix don't seem to realize is that people fight for what is behind them: their families, friends, towns and country, not what is in front of them. The first Matrix movie could get away from this because we could imagine Zion as a wonderful place. However its reality makes it a much difficult to imagine people wanting to fight for it.",5,0,0,6 November 2003
