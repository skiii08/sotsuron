Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mixed feelings
","I guess I'm required by international law to immediately state how let down I was by this film, and to some large extent, I was, but there were things about it I liked.  I think a problem with this film is that it had some great individual parts, but they never came together as a whole.  I also got the feeling the film was just focused-grouped and test-marketed to death, in a vain attempt to be all things to all people.  In the back of my mind, I could never shake the thought that the main purpose of this film was to sell toys.  I would enjoy the Star Wars films a lot more if it wasn't so big of a franchise.  I found Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element to be a more satisfying and honest sci-fi adventure, and I like the fact that it will most likely be sequal-less.  I also liked the fact that it took itself much less seriously, and didn't have the weight of an entire franchise on it's shoulders, which I think was a major problem with The Phantom Menace.I think a big problem was the casting.  I didn't like the performance from the kid who played Anakin (let me state that I do feel a little uncomfortable criticizing child actors, even when a lot of them just aren't very good, which is understandable.  It seems like good child actors are often non-American).  Natalie Portman, best known from Luc Besson's film Leon, gives a passable performance, given what little she had to work with. Liam Nesson had a 'what am I doing here?' look throughout the film.  I never really bought Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.On the other hand, a lot the visuals are pretty stunning, like the 'New York City planet' Corsucant, and the light saber duel at the end was pretty cool; but overall, I got the feeling I was basically watching the original Star Wars re-tooled and test-marketed for late-90s consumption, and a lot of the things I liked about Star Wars were missing.",Null,0,1,10 December 1999
Akira," 'Without their bikes, they're like fish in a meadow!'
","I could go on about how amazing and groundbreaking this film is, but you've probably already heard it before.  That having been said, it is an amazing film.  It has some of the best animation I've ever seen, it has a very realistic look and feel, while having a distinctly animated style, if that makes any sense.  Despite being almost 12 years old, it still looks very fresh.  The film has some very impressive action setpieces, like the opening battle between biker gangs, famous among anime fans.  Anyone who's a fan of 80's style 'body-horror' films is sure to like this one.One thing the film is notable for is direction by the creator of the comic that it's based on (Katsuhiro Otomo), which is pretty rare.  Sure, it's not uncommon for a comic's creator to be involved with the film version, like co-writing the script or producing, but for the original creator to have this level of control over the film version is unusual.  Just imagine if Frank Miller wrote and directed a Sin City film.  The only other example of this I can think of off the top of my head is Hayao Miyazaki's film of his manga Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.On top of all that is the excellent musical score composed by Shoji Yamashiro and performed by the group Genioh Yamashirogumi.  The score ranges from both dynamic pieces for the action scenes to very spooky, otherworldly music.  Vocals (including Buddhist chanting), instruments, and synthesized sounds are combined perfectly.  Unfortunately, this is the only film project Genioh Yamashirogumi has done.If you can, watch the subtitled version of the film (of course, that's true for most non-English films, but particularly advisable for this one).  The Japanese voice actors do a much more professional, less 'cartoony' job than the American actors.  You also have to take into consideration that the actors' performances were recorded before the animation was produced, to better match up the voices to the characters' lip and facial movements.  Needless to say, this effect is ruined by the English dubbing.  Not only that, I really prefer the translation of the subtitles to Carl Macek's 'adapted' script.  After having seen the subtitled version, I find the dubbed version painful to watch.For all the fancy visuals, the plot isn't bad either, despite suffering a little from being condensed from a fairly lengthy manga series.  I've seen few other films to present a near-apocalyptic world so compellingly (George Romero's Dawn of the Dead comes to mind).  It also has a healthy dose of satire mixed in, which is appreciated.  The scene with the council meeting around a circular table evokes the War Room in Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Many other reviews have made comparisons between Akira and 2001: A Space Odyssey, with it's mystical ambiguous ending.It may not be the 'ne plus ultra' of anime that some people have described it as, but I would still say it's indispensable for anyone interested in science fiction or animation.",Null,0,3,3 January 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Mediocre script saved by great visuals
","1997 was a really good year if you wanted to see sci-fi movies by non-American directors (the directors of this film and The Fifth Element are French, the director of Starship Troopers is Dutch (but lives in the US), the director of Mimic is Mexican).  It's interesting to see the sensibility brought to the films by these directors.  I think it's really interesting to see the style of Jean Pierre Jeunet, director (with Marc Caro) of Delicatessen and City of Lost Children, both visual wonders and among the best films of the 90s (up against some stiff competition); applied to an Alien film.  I think it's interesting how  all the Alien films have different directors, and the series is kind of like that game children play where one writes the beginning of a story, and another writes the next part, and so on.  Of course, a lot of series fans don't like this, and were upset by the unfairly maligned Alien 3 after the slam-bang actioner Aliens.In a lesser director's hands, Alien: Resurrection would probably be the worst of the Alien films to date.  The rather hackneyed script by Joss Whedon doesn't help anything.  What saves the film is the remarkable visual style of Jean Pierre-Jeunet, along with the photography of Darius Khondji, one of the best cinematographers working today.  Some of the action scenes are good too, like the long underwater sequence (I think underwater scenes are a Jeunet and Caro trademark).  John Frizell's score is serviceable, but far from the eerie Jerry Goldsmith score for the original film by Ridley Scott.  I would've liked it if Angelo Badalamenti had been retained from City of Lost Children.I think the film has a very French, avant-garde style to it, much like HR Giger's designs (Giger is Swiss, I know); and has has a similar Gothic feeling to David Fincher's Alien 3.  The script and some of the performances (like those of Dan Hedaya and Brad Dourif [not that I don't like them]) lend the film a slight tone of camp, which feels a little incongrous with Jeunet's direction.  Sigourney Weaver is good as usual, and I enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinion, from Delicatessen and City of Lost Children (his line 'who were you expecting, Santa Claus?' is from City, although it was Miette who said it, not him); I probably would've cast someone other than Winona Ryder in the role of Call, though. Even though this is the first Alien film with a European director, the series has had a European connection from the first film, with Giger's designs, and much of the first half of the film being inspired by Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.  I think if Dario Argento directed an Alien film (that would go against the pattern of the Alien films being helmed by fairly new directors), it might be a little like this one.Another complaint I have is that the screenwriter doesn't really explore the possibilities of the technology that must have developed during the 200 years between Alien 3 and this film.  I know it makes for an interesting horror film concept, but why did they have to kidnap people in hypersleep to infect with the aliens?  You'd think they'd be able to clone humans by then or do something else.I think Jeunet was a really interesting choice of director for this film. I nominate the Wachowski brothers to direct Alien 5 (with Bill Pope as DP, of course).  This film certainly isn't as good as Ridley Scott's classic Alien, but still a worthwhile entry into the series.",Null,0,1,13 December 1999
The Fifth Element," Possibly my favorite sci-fi film of the 90s
","I've heard more than one person compare this film to Blade Runner (one [out of several] of my favorite sci-fi films of the 80s), despite the somewhat similar settings, it's hard to imagine two more different films.  This colorful sci-fi action spoof is also a marked contrast to Besson's previous films La Femme Nikita and Leon (known as The Professional here in the States), but does share some similarities with them.  Much like Nikita and Leon have a distinctive French style to them (even though the latter is set in the U.S.), The Fifth Element takes a lot of stylistic cues from French and Japanese comic books, both of which I'm a fan of, particularly Moebius (who contributed some designs to The Fifth Element) and Shirow Masamune (speaking of which, watch for a volume of the excellent Yakuza (Japanese for gangster) comic Sanctuary in Korben Dallas' apartment).The film isn't set so much in the future, more of a futurized comic book version of the world that Nikita and Leon are set in.  I always find futuristic worlds that are still grappling with contemporary problems more interesting, maybe that's part of why I've never found the utopian world of Star Trek very interesting.From my understanding, Besson wrote an early draft of the story in high school (along with an early draft of the under-appreciated The Big Blue), which I think is cool, since I can relate, because in school, I had (as of yet, unrealized) dreams of being a filmmaker, and I would often draw cartoons or write stories to help relieve the tedium of high school.  Of course, most of them were crap, and have no chance in hell of ever being made into a film.Besson has a wonderful visual style, here, it's very interesting to see him apply that style to a sci-fi world rather than a contemporary world (as in his films from Subway to Leon) or a bleak post-apocalypse world (as in the lesser known than it should be Le Dernier Combat).  Of course, credit is also due to production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (Arbogast's cinematography was one of the few redeeming features of the dismal Wing Commander).  Along with John Woo, Luc Besson is my favorite action director (they may have a three-way tie with the Wachowski brothers if they make more films like The Matrix). Eric Serra's excellent musical score is also worth mentioning.  I really enjoyed seeing Gary Oldman repeat his villain role from Leon, although in this film, his character is more cartoonish than evil.  I also really like a lot of the visual humor Besson included, like the cigarettes that are 3/4ths filter, and the well-edited sequence when the jet is taking of for Flosthon Paradise.A couple of complaints though, I would've liked to see Jean Reno play Korben Dallas, not that Bruce Willis did a bad job.  I wonder if Reno was originally cast for the part, but backed out.  Reno is one of my favorite actors, I could really imagine him in the role.  Another thing, I've never found Milla Jovovich's fight scene very believable, maybe I'm just spoiled from having seen so many kung fu movies, particularly the newer ones, like with Jet Li.  There are also a few plot holes and lapses in logic, but I choose not to worry about them too much, this isn't a film to take seriously or over-analyze.  I say if you can't enjoy the occasional silly action flick (like this one, which succeeds admirably on that level), you're taking life too seriously.",Null,1,2,7 December 1999
My Neighbor Totoro," If only there was more animation like this
","Sure, I enjoy hyperviolent John Woo and Brian DePalma-type flicks as much as the next guy, but films such as this one are a nice change of pace.  I really wish Hayao Miyazaki's films were more readily avalible in the US, I've yet to see a less than amazing film by this master animator.  I really hope the theatrical release of the masterpiece Princess Mononoke (which I've only been able to see on video) causes people to check out this and other Miyazaki films.  The film contains some wonderful, hilarious moments like when the Totoro discovers how to use an umbrella, and the 'catbus'.  The score by Joe Hisaishi is very good too, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto (The Last Emperor), Akira Ifukube (Godzilla), Masaru Sato (Yojimbo), and Toru Takemitsu (Ran), Hisaishi is my favorite Japanese film composer.I highly reccomend this film for both children and adults, if I had children, I would definitely show it to them.  I would show them there's more to animation than cheesy 30 minute toy commercials.  If we were living in a more perfect world, this is what would be showing instead of Pokemon: The First Movie.  And adults, don't feel silly renting this for yourself. Even though i'm an adult, I never for a moment felt silly watching this film.  The same goes for other very good animated films that are supposedly for kids, like Toy Story 2 and Nick Park's wonderful Wallace and Gromit shorts.  The Fox/Streamline English-dubbed version is very good, way better than most English dubs of anime.  This version is good to show to younger kids who may have trouble following subtitles.  Still, I really hope this film gets released on DVD someday and has the original Japanese language track.  This film will come as a real surprise to anyone who thinks all anime is gory sci-fi, not that there aren't some films in that category I like.",Null,0,1,9 December 1999
Barry Lyndon," Pure Kubrick
","I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie, I watched it recently, and my mindset going into it was was 'well, it'll be well-photographed and have the usual interesting Kubrick thematics, but it'll probably feel kinda long, and you probably won't have a big urge to rewatch it anytime soon, sort of like Eyes Wide Shut'.  Thankfully, I was wrong, I wouldn't call the 18th century costume drama my favorite type of film, but I found this one to be very absorbing.  Even though it's a bit over three hours long, it never feels 'slow' or 'boring', there's a lot that goes on in it.  Like all Kubrick films, there's a lot of different layers to it, and you probably have to watch it more than once to get everything out of it.  The famous duel scene toward the end of the film is one of the best I've ever seen, right up there with the climax of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (even though they couldn't be much more different).  The more ominous 'duel version' of the film's main theme that starts before the actual duel and goes on for what feels like about 20 minutes (I didn't time it) works almost like the audio equivalent of Chinese water torture and helps to bring the tension to a nearly unbearable level.  A great film, worth the investment of three hours.",9,1,2,1 September 2000
Léon: The Professional," Luc Besson at his best
","A common theme throughout the films of Luc Besson is that his characters are like Charles Bronson in Once Upon a Time in the West, 'They've got something inside, something to do with death,' this theme had certainly been explored before in The Big Blue and La Femme Nikita, but I think it reaches it's peak with this film.The three leads (Reno, Portman, and Oldman) are just perfect in their roles, I have a hard time imagining anyone else playing them.  A lot of child actors aren't very good (which is understandable), but Portman gives a great performance in this film.  I really wish Jean Reno starred in more films, it seems like he only has supporting roles in all the other ones I've seen him in.  Gary Oldman turns in one of the great villian performances of recent history.As much as I enjoy Hong Kong action films by directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam, it's nice to see an action film done in a different style like this one is.    I haven't seen much French action other than Besson's films, most of the European action I've seen are Italian films from the 70s and 80s like with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, and Maurizio Merli.  Some are good, a lot are pretty forgettable.  Leon kind of puts me in mind of a modern-set spaghetti western, like a lot of Italian actioners (a lot of which were made by people who got their start making westerns, like Enzo G. Castellari).  I think Leon really stands out from other European-made actioners, and I also think it's a really unique film in the action-crime genre.  Granted, the basic concept of the story may not be unique, but it's what Besson does with it that makes it unique.As I've said in other commentaries of Besson films, I think he has a really great visual style.  When you talk about the look of the film, production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast definately deserve credit, both of them also worked on La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. The music by Eric Serra is very good too.*****Possible Minor Spoilers in next paragraph********If you're really interested in this film, do yourself a favor and seek out the extended version.  With a lot of directors' cuts, the additional scenes are interesting, but not essential to the plot, and you can see why they were cut to streamline the film; but this one is different.  I think the American version of the film (under the really lame re-title The Professional) is damaged by the absence of the 20 minutes of footage that was cut from it.  With the possible exception of one or two scenes, I think everything that was cut is essential to the story.  What's possibly my favorite sequence in the movie (when Leon takes Matilda on a series of assignments, and she puts gum over the peepholes of the apartments they go to) was cut from the American version, I think it's interesting that part of this sequence foreshadows the ending (I won't say how for those of you who haven't seen it yet).  There's also an explanation of what Tony meant when he said that Leon had gotten in trouble over a woman before, which also explains why Leon doesn't return Matilda's sexual advances (I really dislike how the American version leaves the issue of their relationship unresolved by the absence of this scene, and I think having them wake up in bed together without this scene is just sloppy.)  Still, this is far from the worst American tampering with a Besson film.The climax of the film is just an incredible piece of filmmaking, comparable to the Peckinpah-style church shootout at the end of John Woo's The Killer. Even though Besson's other films are very good too, I think this is his masterpiece to date, and just a great film any way you slice it.  It's one of my top ten favorite movies.  Go rent it right now if you haven't already, If you have a DVD player, go rent the DVD, Leon, like all Besson films, simply must be seen letterboxed, much like Sergio Leone's films.  Besson's brilliant shot composition is just ruined by pan and scanning.",Null,0,1,10 December 1999
The Evil Dead," One of the great horror films
","I think the first Evil Dead is my favorite of the trilogy, even though everyone I know says 2 is the best.  Strangely enough, the first time I watched the trilogy, I watched the films in reverse order, having been introduced to the series by Army of Darkness, then watching Evil Dead 2, and then (after some searching, this was well before Anchor Bay's re-release) Evil Dead.  I think the reason it's my favorite of the trilogy is that it's a horror comedy that puts equal emphasis on both.  Evil Dead 2 would lean more toward the comedy aspect, and Army of Darkness essentially became an action comedy with monsters.An incredible film when you consider it was made by a bunch of college students.  Some very innovative camera-work, including the now-famous 'Raimi-cam', as Joel Coen calls it.  Has some rather low-tech but still effective special effects, some of them are a little creaky compared to the effects in the sequals though.  Being a big fan of stop motion animation, I really enjoy the stop-motion special effects.  I can see why a lot of Asian horror movies, like Hong Kong's Chinese Ghost Story series and the Japanese Evil Dead Trap (the sequals are in name only, and have less of a supernatural element) are influenced by this film.  The acting is a little amateurish, but it gets the job done, and is appropriate to a film like this.  We get a feeling that the Ash persona hasn't quite developed yet in this film, a lot of Evil Dead fans complain he comes off as kind of a wimp in this film, I think that's appropriate though, and important to the development of the character.  I think overall, this is a very different film from the two sequals (which I like very much, but prefer the first).  In this film, the violence comes of as a bit more graphic, and not as slapsticky as in the sequals.  It's hard to measure, but I think this is the goriest of the three.  The sequals may be much more polished and technically accomplished, with excellent cinematography by Peter Deming in Evil Dead 2 and by Bill Pope in Army of Darkness, but The Evil Dead has a certain raw, original quality the sequals tried, but failed to recapture.  I think the sequals are both very good films in their own right, but I think The Evil Dead is the best of the trilogy.  One of the all time great horror films, along with Dario Argento's Suspiria, George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, Peter Jackson's Braindead (Dead Alive in the U.S.), and many other great films I don't have room to list.",Null,0,0,8 December 1999
The Big Blue," Beautiful film
","Anyone expecting an action film similar to Besson's later films La Femme Nikita, Leon (aka The Professional), The Fifth Element, or Joan of Arc (aka The Messenger) is bound to be dissapointed, but this is still required viewing for anyone interested in the films of Luc Besson (well, actually, I'd say all of his films are).  I just love Besson's visual style, here aided by Carlo Varini's excellent cinematography.  From La Femme Nikita on, Besson would use Thierry Arbogast as his DP. Some incredible location shooting and underwater photography, the diving scenes of the two main characters are simply stunning.  I wonder what kind of training these actors had to go through.  Jean Reno, one of my favorite actors, gives a great performance, as always.  Overall great film.  Definately try and find the original European version, the American version is missing about 40 minutes, has different music (Eric Serra's music is a major component in Besson's films, changing it would be like replacing the Ennio Morricone score for a Sergio Leone film or the Bernard Herrmann score for an Alfred Hitchcock film), and has a more Hollywood-like ending.  Also definately try and find it letterboxed, some films are watchable pan and scanned, this is not one of them.",Null,0,1,30 November 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Disappointing
","I went into this film with somewhat low expectations, but hey, it's John Woo, I would probably go to a sequal to a movie based on a Saturday Night Live sketch if he was the director.  It was kind of what I was afraid a neutered PG-13 John Woo movie would be like.  Face/Off gave me hope that a good compromise could be reached between mainstream Hollywood action filmmaking, and John Woo's peculiar brand of 'heroic bloodshed' cinema.  You can occasionally see a little bit of the John Woo we know and love trying to get out, but mainly this is a showcase for Tom Cruise's ego.  You get the feeling that the producers were keeping Woo on a short leash.  There were sequences in the movie where I thought to myself 'I know this is supposed to be an exciting sequence, but I'm just not excited'.  Good actors like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames are given fairly useless roles where they have nothing to do.  Robert Townes' cheesy script makes me think Chinatown being good was due more to Roman Polanski than him.  A far cry from Woo's classic HK films like A Better Tomorrow I&II, The Killer, A Bullet in the Head, and Hard-Boiled.",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
A Bug's Life," Good, but not great
","Of course, comparison between this film and the superior (my opinion) Antz is inevitable, but I think other than the fact that they're computer animated and have to do with ants, they have very little in common. They're completely different stories, if Antz is Metropolis, this film is The Seven Samurai (or The Magnificent Seven if you prefer).  Not to say this film is a Seven Samurai remake, other than the concept of a besiged village hiring warriors, it really doesn't have anything in common with Kurosawa's film.I really did like the fact that Antz was PG, and had an 'edge' to it, I'm really glad that people are starting to see that animation need not be just for kids, in Europe and Japan, this is not a new idea.  A Bug's Life is much more of a kid's film by comparison, but that didn't keep me from liking it. I do have some complaints though, I didn't find Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) to be a very strong lead character, I thought Woody Allen's Z was a much better lead.  Another thing I didn't like was the character designs, much too 'cute'.  Why are the ants blue?  I have never seen a blue ant, or a four-legged one (actually, these are more two-armed, two-legged).  The world of Antz had a real sense of danger to it, that I think was only hinted at in this film.Technically, the film is flawless, I think the quality of the animation is one area where Antz and this film may tie.  The animation in this film is very good, some of the characters almost look more like very smooth claymation than CGI.  I think computer animation really does it's job when you don't think about it coming from a computer, and I had moments of that feeling watching this film.  As to be expected from a digital-to-digital transfer, the DVD looks beautiful.  The two sets of 'outtakes' during the end credits are pretty clever, if you watch the film for the first time on DVD, watch the movie before you watch they outtakes, they're funnier that way.  The short 'Geri's Game' that precedes the film is a real gem, too (I enjoyed Geri's cameo appearance in Toy Story II).This film is definately worth seeing if you're a fan of computer animation, but don't expect Antz, I really wish the two films had been released further apart.  Also, if you like insect movies, also check out the French documentary Microcosmos.",Null,0,1,18 December 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," possibly my favorite gangster film
","I have a hard time deciding whether I like The Godfather I and II or this film better.  I do lean a little toward this one though.  I look at this film as a kind of cult alternative to the Godfathers.  It's directed by Sergio Leone, best known for his 'spaghetti westerns' with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef.  From what I've read, Leone had this film in mind since the mid-60's, but the studio wanted another western, so the brilliant Once Upon a Time in the West was made, then the flawed but very interesting Mexican revolution epic A Fistful of Dynamite, and then Leone produced, co-wrote, and directed a few scenes (uncredited, Tonino Valerii was credited as director) of the lesser-known-than-it-should-be Western Comedy My Name Is Nobody.  I think the way Leone directs his first (and unfortunately last) gangster film is interesting to contrast with those of Francis Ford Copolla and Martin Scorsese.The film has the feeling of a guilt-ridden, drug-fueled nightmare; few films have been able to capture this feeling so effectively.  The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli which creates a very dreamlike rather than realistic look, and the excellent haunting score by the great Ennio Morricone (a grade school classmate of Leone and his regular composer from A Fistful of Dollars on, interestingly enough, the score was composed a whole seven years before filming began) contribute a lot to this feeling.  Morricone would later borrow from himself a little when composing the score for Brian DePalma's film The Untouchables.  The first time I saw this film, it stayed with me for days.  The structuring of the film is very unique too, jumping from the 1930s to the 60s back to the 20s, none feels like 'the present', they all swirl together.A very unique film, don't let the almost-four-hours running time scare you off, I've watched it several times, and it doesn't feel like almost four hours.  The film is structured so elegantly, I can't imagine cutting a minute.  (definately only watch the 226 minute version, the original theatrical release was re-edited and shortened signifigantly, which, needless to say, was quite damaging).  Of course, when I watch it on video, I do feel the need for the occasional intermission. I would be thrilled at the opportunity to see this film in a theater, but it would definately strain my bladder.  This definately isn't a film for those who think of movies as disposable fast food entertainment, and think 90 minutes is an ideal running time for all films.  90 minutes may be just the right amount of time for some films to tell their story (of course, some only require about 10 minutes), but not this one.",Null,0,1,10 December 1999
The Matrix," Cyberpunk kung fu at it's best
","The Wachowski brothers follow up their excellent neo-noir film Bound with this visually amazing cyberpunk action flick.  I can't believe this is only the second movie these guys have made.  The Wachowskis wisely retained several team members from Bound, including cinematographer Bill Pope, composer Don Davis, editor Zach Staenberg, and actor Joe Pantoliano (here in a smaller role than Bound).  Keanu Reeves isn't as annoying as he tends to be, and pulls off his fight scenes surprisingly well.  All the actors do, thanks to rigorous training by legendary Hong Kong action director Yuen Woo-Ping.  I've always said that American action directors should take a lesson from their Hong Kong counterparts, possibly the best directors of action on the planet.  Hugo Weaving is a great villain, I think the only other movies I've seen that he was involved with are Babe and the unfairly ignored Babe: Pig In The City (he did voice work for both, only briefly in the latter), but I'm already a fan.The film takes it's story from many disparate elements, including crime films, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese anime, and kung fu movies, all of which are things I like.  The stylistic influence of directors such as John Woo, Tsui Hark, Mamoru Oshii, and others are evident in many scenes.The cinematography by Bill Pope is also excellent, as usual.  Wheras Bound had a great film noir-style 'b&w in color' look, everything in the Matrix seems to have a sickly green computerish color, as if everything is shot under fluorescent light.In some ways, the story makes me think a lot of the story of Bound, both are about a journey to freedom, and the majority of the film being set either in the Nebuchanezzar or The Matrix reminds me of Bound being set mostly in two rooms.  With only two films under their belts, the Wachowski brothers are already a major talent to watch for, I eagerly await their upcoming Matrix prequel and sequel (I wonder which is going to be made first).",Null,0,0,9 December 1999
Princess Mononoke," Classic of animation
","I cannot possibly say enough good things about this film.  I'm really dissapointed Miramax isn't giving this film a wider release.  More people need to see this.  Even only having seen it on video (and a less than perfect copy at that), I find it to be a much more satisfying adventure than the last Star Wars film or the last Disney animated film.  I can see why this film is the top-grossing film to date in Japan.  I don't put this film in the same category as your usual 'Japanimation', because I really don't see myself as a big 'Japanimation' person, I just look at it as a very good animated film that just happens to come from Japan, much the same way I look at Miyazaki's other films, Akira, and the films of Mamoru Oshii.The film is written and directed by master animator Hayao Miyazaki, from whom I have yet to see a less-than amazing film.  The artwork and animation in this film are beautiful, and the film has a much more 'cinematic' feeling than a lot of animation, Miyazaki could direct a great live-action film if he wanted to (some anime directors have also directed live-action films, like Oshii and Otomo).  One thing I like that that the CGI was used sparingly and effectively, not obtrusively like in a lot of animation these days.  The film also makes me think a lot of The Thin Red Line in it's depiction of nature balanced with violent conflict.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is simply beautiful, I personally think it's one of the great film scores of all time, right up there with Ryuichi Sakamoto's score for The Last Emperor (which Hisaishi's score for this film reminds me of a little in parts).In short, an incredible film, if possible, see it in a theater, or, failing, that, video.  Just see it!  I'm purchasing the DVD the day it's released.",9,0,1,10 December 1999
