Spartacus," Starkly realistic. Visually stunning
","Contrast. Kubrick applies it in this story, making use of the dictatorial might of Rome revealed in Crassus (Olivier) and the longing to be free, as portrayed by the slave Spartacus (Douglas). Although we may understand Crassus's maniacal love for Rome, Kubrick allows us to recognize through Spartacus, our own rational passion for freedom.Story telling aside, imagery is also used to contrast ideas. A casual discussion between Roman dignitaries in the foreground, coldly indifferent to gladiators fighting to the death in the background, contrasts adequately both human decadence and desperation. More importantly, since our attention is on the fight, their inattention is accentuated, defining cool depravity. Throughout the film, decency and depravity are displayed. The love affair between Spartacus and Varinia is among the most passionate I have ever seen on film, with little, if any, sexual innuendo. Evil is manifested in casualness: As two Roman women sip on wine, they coolly select the men that they will watch try to butcher one another. It is as if Kubrick possesses the desire to present on film the fundamental nature of an idea, or perhaps, the very best example of it. He certainly had the ability.Spartacus ends with bittersweet imagery. As an eleven-year-old, it was difficult to see the hero die, crucified. But now, when I study the pain-staking attention to cinematic perspective that places the climax of the story in the background where all my attention is instinctively focused, I realize that I was not only influenced by emotional story-telling, but by remarkable visual imagery",10,4,7,1 June 2007
Coraline," Has a European Aura
","The stop-action is a little jumpy, but the concept designs were brilliant. The story is interesting and moves along at a clip. Visually, it stands alone within its genre. The same story could have been achieved with actors, but not the intended mood.And it is the mood aspect that will probably not find its way into the senses of most American audiences. Its aura is foreign. It embodies European-Gothic impressionism with dancing, marionette-like characters. It is dark and somewhat macabre. Even the music sounds foreign, though some of it is haunting and helps to provoke mood.Coraline is a masterpiece. It is not, in my opinion for kids under 8, but it really depends on the kid. As for adults, the film has the same entertainment value that can be found by mixing Toy Story with Cirque de Solei. If you enjoy these, you'll have a good time here.",10,4,10,14 February 2009
The Babadook," Fantasy Horror vs Disturbing Subject Matter
","'The Babadook' appears at first to be just another slice of horror for those who enjoy the genre. Indeed, not only horror, but, as was 'The Shining', a disturbing psychological study of a mentally ill mind. And, as such it works well. But, the average horror buff isn't going to be satisfied here. It is obvious that there was no intention for 'The Babadook' to do so. One can draw an easy conclusion of why the writer-director Jennifer Kent would labor at such elaborately abstract images to exact such a story. Perhaps to allow us to come face-to- face with evil without the graphics - thankfully - although there are some images that are very disquieting. In today's world of high school shootings, decapitations, and massive carnage, American society doesn't like dealing with its own dysfunction. We let politicians do it. We seldom seek counseling from those that might give us insight. Even when our youth are gunned down in our own neighborhoods do we refuse to negotiate even halfhearted contemplation about the potential evil that exists in the human psyche.",8,3,11,8 December 2014
Burn After Reading," The Coens entertainingly preach to the choir.
","The Coen's are creative at conjuring up absurd stories to fascinate us. However, I personally feel that Blood Simple and Fargo are still the best examples of their genius.Burn After Reading is darkly humorous, sarcastic, and, as usual, nihilistic. We clearly understand an underlying premise to the story during the end credits when 'CIA man' is blurted out in raucous song to celebrate the agency's supposed ineptitude.It is easy to recognize a liberal slant (not surprising) in the Coen's endeavor to proselytize. In the beginning, a principal character is accused of having a drinking problem. He recoils to his accuser, 'You're a Mormon. Next to you everyone has a drinking problem.' My first thought: How much more that would have gone over if Mitt Romney had been chosen as McCain's running mate for president. Hollywood is now a 'vatican' for liberal dogma. My philosophy teaches that to change minds, you should not be afraid to step on everyone's toes. The Coens only preach to the choir.Burn After Reading is full of cultural satire, but lacks universal appeal and is arguably less believable than the lunacy found in Dr. Strangelove: a film just as comically stark yet more appealing to young and old audiences.In any case, this film takes us for an enjoyable ride, but only while it lasts. At the end we want more.",8,4,10,14 September 2008
Bridge of Spies," Subtle Propaganda swings both ways.
","Propaganda plays out in this latest Spielberg effort. At the start we see a Russian spy arrested by the FBI. He is a most pleasant fellow played by Mark Rylance. Evidently typecast for the part, he is as soft- spoken and sincere as he was in 'Angels and Insects'. With a pleasant, Scottish brogue, he exhibits a spy with profound integrity. The depiction of the American response to his escaping the death penalty is embarrassingly sophomoric (Actually, as I can remember as a teenager, there was little or no public outcry at the sentence). The incompetence of American military intelligence is also depicted (70,000 ft wasn't high enough for the U-2 spy plane to avert being shot down). But military incompetence has always been an easy target, especially to a liberally biased Hollywood. Nonetheless, it is well-crafted and enjoyable. And, propaganda evens out as we see the Berlin Wall erected, and the consequent brutality of Soviet tyranny.",7,1,3,26 October 2015
No Country for Old Men," Symbolic doomsday, message film
","And I thought Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was a kick in the teeth. Apparently the Coen bros have become so sophisticatedly successful as film makers that pleasing American audiences is of little concern to them. All the basic formula gimmicks are shattered and we are left with an ending as disturbingly fatalistic as that found in the opera Rigoletto.Symbolically the film's story might have something to say. What happens when a fortune in loot becomes an obsession to someone hunted down by a relentless psycho? What happens to a country obsessed with materialism when religious psychopaths long for its demise? The hero certainly represents most of us. We all desire wealth and are basically good. Our hero's mistake is being human; he attempts to help someone who asked for water. It's too easy to define this film as just a wild depiction of modern day, American Gothic. If that were the case, the ending probably would allow the same kind of satisfaction we experienced in Blood Simple or Fargo. Instead, we are purposely let down and Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get the bad guy. The law fails to protect and exact justice and surrenders to a world of increasing hostility. Even his dream recounting in the final scene reflects America's hypocrisy, or inattention: Who cares? 'Dreams mean little to other than the dreamer.' We want the tangible . . . now, not a dream, not a meaninglessly slow ride to oblivion, not a fade-to-black. Whether you are young or an old man, this country in film is hard to appreciate. Without doubt, the script should be nominated for an Oscar, as well as the cinematography.",9,6,12,23 November 2007
District 9," dismally unoriginal
","One of the first sci-fi films I ever saw was a story of a space craft that lands just outside a small, country town in England. When it is discovered, the town's people, who are very superstitious, eventually greet their visitor (a very old, human-like alien) and then proceed to beat it to death. . . the end. That film's premise is the gist of District 9.English subscripts for alien-speak reminded me of Star Wars. Star Wars didn't try to be provocative. District 9 did, but failed. It is too common for film makers today to treat their audiences as immature. Such gimmicks remind me I'm watching a movie and that the film maker took the easy way in story telling. Communication of ideas can be achieved with imagery alone. The alien mentioned above never said a word, but we understood him nonetheless.(Have since actually seen the film. Much better than I blindly conceived it to be. And I understand the productions logic for using subtitles. Much more original than I believed it to be.)",8,3,9,16 August 2009
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time . . . . . . .
","Thanks Q.T. for writing this period piece. I was in the Army in 1969. It does homage to a well-known, historical truth by changing it. I almost left the theater half way when I perceived the subject. If it had been depicted I would have walked out. Instead, I can reflect on the truth without the details.",10,29,44,15 August 2019
The Theory of Everything," A Romance of God, Science, and a Physically Stricken Genius
","Basically it is about the relationship between the physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife. It is based on Jane Hawking's book. For this I was disappointed. I wanted more his intuitiveness concerning the structure of the universe than his domestic life.However, some of his philosophical perspectives are brought to light. He believes that an equation linking quantum mechanics with relativity can reveal the mind of God - perhaps, but such is purely speculative. Also, his assertion that belief or disbelief in God is inconsequential for legitimate scientific inquiry reveals his scientific/theological perspective, and it is one in which I agree.At the heart of the film is the story of an absolute genius stricken with a catastrophic disease. A scene in the film brilliantly displays his rationale concerning a question given to him regarding the existence of God. The Holy Roman Church promoted scientific inquiry hoping to substantiate scripture, or more precisely a interpretation of scripture. Data didn't substantiate a geocentric universe so to hell with science. Centuries later, Christianity still demonstrates the arrogance of humanity by relying on science (creation science) to prove the existence of God. This, while they decry scientific findings that are contrary to, once again, a interpretation.Atheists are no less biased regarding science and theology. My philosophy suggests that if man, through his own reason, can prove or disprove the existence of God through science, then God isn't enough of a mystery to even consider.",7,1,3,2 May 2015
2012," Monotonous Effects Fizzle
","I dislike criticizing movies, especially ones that I know are not to be taken seriously. This film starts out fine, but crescendos into disappointment. It struggles too hard to out-do itself from one scene to the next and its climactic final writhes in predictability. What should have been exciting to watch becomes tedious. I actually began to nod off three fourths of the way through. The effects are great, especially in the beginning, but the story fizzles with the generic divorced-dad-saves-ex-wife-and-kids gimmick. Can the hero ever be happily married? Yes, it's just a popcorn movie, but unless the popcorn is really delicious, this flick just ain't worth 3 hours, advertisements and coming attractions included.",4,3,6,14 November 2009
Avatar," More fantasy than good sci-fi
","All the special effects money can buy cannot override a soulless script. It exemplifies why the French consider American films sophomoric and vacuous. The same story could be sold to a Saturday morning, cartoon show for the infantile. Maybe it was intended just for kids. The effects were great, but the sci-fi elements were mostly mere fantasy. Pandora is a moon-planet apparently in orbit around a Jupiter-like planet which can only mean substantial time in pitch black darkness. Didn't Cameron consult anyone knowledgeable in science? It looks pretty to the eye but it embarrasses reason. Since so much attention to detail was shown regarding the technology used to project the neurological soul to an avatar, why any less detail given to celestial mechanics?Nonetheless, the beginning scene depicting hyper-sleep technology almost caused a lost of bowel control, it was so awesome. A Man Called Horse is a far better story of whitey eventually recognizing the far, far, far, far, far nobler characteristics of indigenous people. Maybe Avatar is today's representation of that idea. If so, it sure cost a lot more to get the same idea across. The ceremonial dance by the natives reminded me of a MGM musical. About 2 hours into the film I closed my eyes for a short break.",7,2,5,23 December 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Very Scary Sex Story
","Eyes Wide Shut is more of an educational experience than entertainment. There is no classic protagonist to win us over, nobody triumphs and nothing is resolved, except that evil wins the day. Demonic worship clearly represents evil in this film. It is revealed midway with no forewarning. How this ties in to human sexual behavior is for the viewer to conclude. However, the storyteller pulls no punches as to his intention. The enticement sparked in men when they see a beautiful woman (Kidman's nude expose) contrasted to men that hide their identity behind grotesque masks as they seek sexual gratification is just another take on a very familiar theme. Maybe the incentive for this film was to reveal the exploitation of women by a monstrous cult. However, whether Kubrick knew of such a cult is inconsequential. That women are forced, even young girls, into sexual slavery is a sad reality that needs more exposure in an apathetic world steeped in depravity.I don't know how Kubrick died. I believe the film was released after his death.",10,5,10,6 August 2006
Zombieland," ...and Johnny Cash didn't sing a tune. . .
","Since 'Night of the living Dead', zombies have really learned how to move. But they are still dumb and easy to outwit. I felt dumb and outwitted half way through when the cast visits Bill Murray's supposed Beverley Hills mansion. Embarrassing, it seemed like a prolonged out-take. Murray play-acted as in a TV sketch. His portrayal of himself wasn't honest. It became apparent that the makers had a good-o-time developing the story as they went along.However, the fun-park segment at the end saved the film . . . barely.The television ads for 'Zombieland' had Johnny Cash's music. Cash's vocals would have adequately provoked the dark humor this flesh-eating, Southern-Gothic nightmare attempted to impart. Obviously, they used Cash's music as a draw. But his voice was never heard.False advertising and a substandard script will make this film easy for me to forget.",5,15,30,3 October 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese's 'Eyes Wide Shut'
","'The Wolf of Wall Street', Martin Scorsese's new bio pic about a 'get- rich-quick' stock broker is also a commentary about the influence money has on people. It is not un-like Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' in that it is more objective than it is propaganda. Many of the types of scenes used to entertain in other films (specifically sex) are instead used here as a form of documentation. Whether the viewer is entertained is of little importance to the filmmaker. Scorsese can get away with this. He is perhaps the most brilliant motion picture director of our day. He has 'license' to do so, as did Kubrick. His name alone prompted me to see this film. Some have characterized this film as propaganda. They see it as an attempt to display the evils of corporate greed, when, at present, socialistic theory is becoming a reality in American economics. Their case is justified. Hitler did the same with film - as did Stalin. And, when understanding Scorsese's very liberal politics, one can easily come to the conclusion that the incentive to make 'The Wolf of Wall Street' was to influence en masse. If that be true, then one can also make the assertion that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a docudrama about America's obsession with material wealth, sex, and drugs. This would be a more logical assumption. And, it falls back on the accusation that Scorsese doesn't care so much about entertaining as he is about informing. Like 'Eyes Wide Shut' it is an accusation and a mirror: a secular attempt to make immorality unpleasing. As well-made as this film is, the story will not be appreciated. With all of its nudity, sex, and reckless depictions of drug usage, it can easily be described as a tragic story about one man's destructive obsession with making money.",9,1,6,29 December 2013
Inception," Better than average 'Dream Gimmick' movie
","'Inception' has already been defined by its makers as a mixture of James Bond and 'The Matrix'. I was hoping that it would be more, and it was, but not as much as I would have liked it to be.Conceptually it was fascinating. Dreams are fascinating in themselves, and the idea of being able to enter and manipulate the sub-conscious has been around for awhile in movies: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Dreamscape', 'The Cell', and 'What Dreams May Come'. The best of these is 'The Cell', which spins a horrific tale. Yet, as a dream-concept film it is the most visually interesting because it gives us the kind of abstractions that are associated with dreams; abstractions that can make sub-conscious sense, particularly to the dreamer. 'Inception' initially depicts some dream abstractions, but conveniently overrides this by introducing the 'dream architect' whose job it is to make the dream as real as possible. As a result, as our actors jump through dream levels, in which there are four (psychology has determined there are primarily two sub-conscious levels) we observe commonsensical realities - for the most part. Although this is significant to storyline development, it unfortunately means that we are left with familiar visuals (chase scenes and shoot'em- ups) that merely differ from level to level. Soon we find ourselves watching two to four recognizable action scenarios that are implied to be transpiring simultaneously.Since this can present the possibility of confusion for the viewer, the film often becomes visually redundant and subsequently monotonous. This was the major flaw of the film, so much so that I almost nodded off. Myself. Yet, the concept of the film overrides this flaw, and much of the imagery is particularly stunning.",8,14,28,26 July 2010
Moon," Moon Clones go 'Luny'
","The film had difficulty making its mind up what it wanted to be: Sci-fi, clone story, or 'evil corporation' movie, or maybe an unintentional mixture of the two. Could have been improved easily: Court room drama, with flashbacks to operations on the moon. The makers obviously tried to tie up loose-ends at the very ending. As our clone re-enters earth's atmosphere, a brief voice-over indicating a supposed, courtroom battle is suggested. Would have been wise to leave that off. Otherwise, the film implied the immorality of cloning. Only trouble with this is the lunar backdrop. We are more interested in the futuristic aspect than with moral questionings. 'Outland', a more entertaining sci-fi film, was also more effective at using moral injustice as an antagonistic platform.",7,0,7,3 August 2009
The Social Network," Style over Story
","The brilliance of this film rests more in its masterful, cinematic story telling than in the story. It is exceptionally well crafted. The editing, screenplay, and direction will most likely be winners at the Oscars.As for the story, one can sum it up quite easily. A Harvard computer-application genius is rejected by his girl friend so he channels his sex drive by denouncing the female race through blogging and hacking Harvard's internet system. This generates 22,000 hits in just a few hours and he becomes famous, but is promptly put on academic probation. From there he uses the school's website as framework for Facebook in which he questionably violates numerous ethics, and eventually law itself. The legal inquiry is meshed throughout stunningly. In the end we see the youngest billionaire in the world sitting alone with a lap-top, sending a Facebook 'Friend Request' to the girl he had revengefully humiliated in his internet blog at the beginning of the film. One can associate this to becoming a victim of one's own creation.The film runs for two hours, but seems like 1 1/2. As suggested above, this is more likely because of style than story - except for the possibility that we all use, and are also likely victims of Facebook.",10,1,2,6 November 2010
From Here to Eternity," Peacetime army in Hawaii
","This film is another reason 'Pearl Harbor' seems so silly. 'From Here to Eternity' is indeed filled with romance, but 'Pearl Harbor' can only be categorized as a chick-flick, schlock fest, mercifully interrupted by a Japanese air raid. Both films have to do with the attack on Pearl Harbor, but, 'From Here to Eternity' does it with an unanticipated, left hook. The victims of Pearl Harbor were never prepared. Perhaps the several, very involving plots in the story were contrived to make us unprepared. The attack by Japanese planes on the army barracks is realistic, even on the emotional level. But, the scene that will forever stand out for me is the knife fight between Pruitt(Clift)and Fatso(Borgnine). Shot through a dark, Honolulu alley, with the music of bars and dance halls in the background, and with very little camera action, we can only imagine and wait, mesmerized in anticipation. This scene sold me on film as a valid art form. It illustrates the vastness of technique that is possible within film to portray any given idea. In this duel to the death scenario, the idea was masterfully depicted without the graphics that would predictably be used today as an attempt to enhance the same idea.",10,2,2,19 August 2006
V for Vendetta," Adolescent and boring
","This film plays well to those of us who have already made their minds up concerning current events(that certain governments are evil). So what? Government gets away with all kinds of bad things, no matter who runs the show. Aside from this, this movie reminded me a lot of 'The Trial of Billy Jack' in its negligent desire to reach a more mature audience. I am tired of 'R' rated films for adolescent mentalities. Young minds are easy to propagandize, especially with easily digestible, non-thinking, fiery slop. Since the story comes from a comic book, maybe it is just for the the intellectually lazy. There are better films that portray similar ideas. 'Brazil' and '1984' are such endeavors. They are far more frightening in their depiction of evil police states. But ideas can be whispered and still change the world. 'V for Vendetta' came close to putting me to sleep, not only because of its naive storytelling, but also because of its tired imagery. Entertainment is what it's all about, and this isn't that much fun to watch.",4,10,18,17 March 2006
