E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Great Film
","This film is about a boy who meets an alien, E.T. In the film, first, E.T. is left alone on the earth and meets the boy. Second, they establish an emotional bond and are one flesh. Finally, E.T. is taken by scientists, but the boy takes him back and helps him to return to his native place. I like the actor of the protagonist because he acts very well. Especially, I think he is good at making his facial expression. It is not too much say that he is a genius child actor. Then, I also like this film itself. This is because I feel this film teaches us that we can establish an emotional bond with even aliens. I don't know whether they really exist or not. However, if they do and we can get on with them, that would be a good thing. Since this film gives us a dream, I think it is a good film.",8,0,2,24 August 2015
500 Days of Summer," Interesting Story
","This film is about a man who believes a fateful love. In the film, first, the man falls in love with the heroine at first sight and makes an approach to her. Second, he gets along with her, but he finds he is just a friend for her. Finally, their relationship ends and each of them takes their own path for the future. I like the editing of this film because it is easy to understand. Although the film shows 500 days of the couple, the story doesn't progress along time series. However, before the story of a day starts, it is shown when the story happens. Therefore, we aren't confused about time series. Then, I also like the actress of the heroine since she is very cute and acts an appealing woman well. I feel the protagonist has no choice but to fall in love with her at first sight. I really enjoyed watching this film throughout the whole.",9,0,0,24 August 2015
The Graduate," This film shows a youngster's uneasiness and fear.
","This is a romantic film about a young man who graduated from college. In the film, first, at his graduation party, he meets the mature woman who is the wife of his father's business partner and has an affair with her. Second, the man's parents suggest to him that he should date with the young woman, who is the mature woman's daughter. Finally, though the man and the young woman are attracted to each other, the mature woman tries to separate them. I like the scene where the man takes the young woman away because it shows he loves her very much. In contrast, I don't like the scene where the man is having an affair with the mature woman. This is because I'm not favorably disposed toward an affair between a young man and a mature woman. I recommend youngsters who have uneasiness for the future to watch this film because it shows a youngster's uneasiness and fear for the future. By watching this film, youngsters can know how uneasiness and fear make their behavior incredible.",7,0,0,7 October 2015
Groundhog Day," Good Comedy
","This is a comedy about a man, who is a popular weather forecaster. In the film, first, he goes to a country town to report 'Groundhog Day.' Second, he notices he spends the exact same day over and over. Finally, he decides to make use of the situation to be a respectable person. I feel it is funny that the man fails to make advances to the heroine over and over. Taking the ending into consideration, we can understand she doesn't like his self-centered attitude. In contrast, I don't like the scene the man tries to kill himself. This is because I wonder whether he really needs to do such a thing. In my opinion, the director can show his feelings by using another way. Anyway, I really enjoyed watching this film throughout the whole. Therefore, I recommend every people to watch it. The structure of the film is simple and easy to understand, so I think every people would enjoy watching this film.",8,1,2,23 August 2015
Some Like It Hot," My favorite film
","This film is about two male musicians who disguise themselves as women to flee the state. In the film, first, two men see the incident and are chased by the Mafia. Second, they disguise themselves as women to belong to an all women band and flee the state. Finally, they love the same woman, a member of the band who plays the ukulele, but they are found by the Mafia. I like the cast of the main characters in this film because they all act very well. Especially, I like the actors of two male musicians. I think it is difficult that actors act as women, but the actors of two male musicians act well and make the film very funny. Then, I also like the actress of the heroine, Marilyn Monroe. In this film, she has some scenes where she sings. Therefore, we can listen to her song and voice. In my opinion, though she doesn't sing well, her unique voice attracts us. When I watched the scene, I listened attentively to her song. This film has a lot of point worthy of note. This is the funniest film I have ever seen.",10,1,2,7 October 2015
When Harry Met Sally...," Nice Romantic Comedy

In the film, first, the hero and heroine meet at the first time, but they don't have a good impression about each other. Second, they meet again after a long time and become best friends. Finally, they have a quarrel, but thanks to it, they can get the answer about their doubt. I like the music which is used in the film since it is apropos and gives the film a good effect. Then, I like the theme of this film because it is interesting. Some people probably have a same doubt as the hero and heroine of this film.

Blade Runner," Amazing Science Fiction
","This film is about a man who hunts replicants. In the film, first, the man begins to investigate replicants which return to the earth. Second, he gets the information and hunts them one after another. Finally, he fights the boss of the replicants and knows why they return to the earth. I like the concept of this film because it makes us think about the relationship between humans and robots. Robots are often created to help humans, but they don't complaint because they don't have feelings. However, if they have feelings, what would they do? I feel the answer is in this film. I don't like a violent action scene, so I shut my eyes while such a scene is shown in this film. However, in order to show the concept of the film, such a scene is needed. This is because it shows robots' feelings for humans. Robots, which are created to help humans, would be angry for humans if they have feelings. This film makes me think about that deeply. I think this film is a good science fiction.",9,2,4,24 August 2015
The Breakfast Club," Nice Comedy
","This film is a story about protagonists who must go to school to take a lecture for problem children on Saturday. In the film, first, their teacher tells them to write an essay about what you are. Then, in spite of the instruction, the protagonists don't follow and try to probe into their secret each other. Finally, although they have a quarrel, they can understand each other and finish the lecture on Saturday. There are five protagonists in the film. I think all these actors and actresses act very well. Especially, an actress who acts a mysterious character is great. This is because she plays a difficult character to act well and succeeds in expressing the atmosphere which the mysterious character has. While I watched the film, I was never bored because the story of the film developed at a quick pace. Sometimes we don't like such a film, but I think most people are never bored while they watch this film.",10,0,0,19 July 2015
