Hereditary," Not a bad movie...
","It starts out rather convoluted. By the time it gets interesting, it doesn't take long to figure out witchcraft is involved. However by the end, it feels rushed and like the ending was just slapped together last minute. The poor ending totally takes away from the movie. Not to mention it is never explained why the females of the family lose their heads.",6,1,2,12 September 2018
The Witch," Period movie about a family who is isolated near a forest and sinister events ensue.
","I consider myself a horror movie buff. I have seen nearly every horror movie out there that has been made in the last 30 years. However, in regards to this particular movie I could not have been more disappointed. From the majority of the reviews I had come across on various websites related to this film I began watching with the expectation of a good scary movie. But boy I could not have been more wrong! Between the Older English dialogue and the inconsistent volume of the actors' voices it was difficult to understand what was being said, if at all. The actual 'story', and I use this term loosely, was practically nonexistent. There was one, only one, scene that was startling, in the sense that it could make you jump. All in all this movie was a waist of time and money. Huge let down!",2,2,4,25 June 2016
