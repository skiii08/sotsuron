Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Every millimeter is pure Star Wars!
","If I were made of celluloid, I'd dream of being used for Star Wars - Part II.I'd be the happiest celluloid strip in the world, and I'd have a whole bunch of medichlorons in me, that would be so cool...I enjoyed The Phantom Menace not for the classical story-mix of 'blockade, war, fight and victory' but for the new perspectives it gives us on the old trilogy. Who would have thought I'd ever consider Darth Vader a lousy sword fighter? After seeing Dart Maul fight I do.As Qui Gon says: 'There is always a bigger fish!'",9,0,0,20 May 1999
