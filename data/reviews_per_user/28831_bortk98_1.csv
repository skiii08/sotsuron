The King's Speech," good movie!
","I can't remember when I've enjoyed a drama on the big screen - since 'The Straight Story' by David Lynch, as much as I have enjoyed this particular film. Every shot and shot were masterpieces by themselves, as oil paintings on canvas, the editing made these 'oil paintings' into sheer poetry on film, and the magnificent sound was just the topping on this delightful cake... The script is eloquent (no pun intended!) and conveys a simple story, yet with all meaningful complexities of soul and mind. Magnificent casting, impeccable directing and acting. I heard it was excellent and it even exceeded my expectations. This movie definitely gets both my thumbs up! Highly recommended for lovers of the fine art of film-making.If anyone wants to discuss this movie with me, feel free to add me on MSN: bortk98@hotmail.com Love, Linda",8,0,0,2 April 2011
