It," It's time to float!
","I waited months to see this movie, and after seeing It, I can say it was well worth the wait. The acting was great, the pacing was good, and the story was fantastic. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough Pennywise.This It makes the original TV miniseries look like childs play. Bill Skarsgard nailed Pennywise. Tim Curry was great, but I think Bill did it better. Every time Pennywise was on screen, I could just feel it. He played the comical yet terrifying clown to a T. Which is why I wish there were more of it.The kid actors were perfect. Jaeden did great as the stuttering Bill, Finn did great as foul mouthed Richie, Sophia did great as misunderstood Beverly. The bullies made me hate them. Everyone did great. Especially Bill as Pennywise.Overall, I was very impressed. Georgies arm being bit off, Beverly being showered in blood. I enjoyed It.",10,13,27,8 September 2017
Toy Story 4," Great, but not better than 3.
","As soon as Toy Story 4 was announced, I said that the third one was going to be hard to beat. And after seeing the fourth entry, that statement is still true.This film should not be considered as a continuation of Toy Story 3. It takes place two years later with Bonnie finally entering Kindergarten. Woody, to his dismay, is one of her least favorites. He gets left in the closet, and even has his sheriff badge torn off only to see it being placed on Jessie. He still cares about Bonnie, and sneaks into her backpack to see how she does at kindergarten orientation. Without realizing it, he essentially helps Bonnie create Forky, a plastic spork that she now considers her favorite toy.Is it a good film? Absolutely. The story itself is good and the animation is top notch beautiful. Does it capture the essence of the previous films? No. Which is why I think it shouldn't be compared to the other three. This Toy Story focuses on the new characters while the original characters, aside from Woody and Buzz, get left in the dust. Rex, Slinky, Potato Heads, Hamm, Bullseye, and Jessie are hardly seen in the movie and the only time Jessie is relevant is when she makes the tire on the RV go flat. I realize they had to make room for the new characters, but they could've made the original characters have some relevance instead of having them stay inside of the RV the whole time. Especially since they've been, for the most part, crucial characters in the previous films.Now, the ending. It was emotional, but it did feel kind of rushed and out of character. The whole reason Woody didn't go to college with Andy in TS3 is because he didn't want to leave his friends. And the reason he didn't go to Japan in TS2 is because he didn't want to leave his kid and wanted to stay with his friends. In this one, he abruptly decides to leave Buzz and the rest of the gang so he can travel the world with Bo Peep, who he hasn't seen in 9 years. This film takes place over the course of a day. Woody even mentions loyalty in this film. You call that being loyal? For once I have to disagree with Woody. You're gonna leave your friends that you've known your whole life for a Toy you haven't seen in nine years? I realize, if he went with Bonnie, he just would've been thrown in the closet again. It just seems out of character for Woody to make that kind of decision in such a small amount of time.I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the quick flashback at the beginning followed by You've Got a Friend in Me. I'd rank it the third best. 3 2 4 1. Thats how I rank it.",8,1,3,23 June 2019
It Chapter Two," Pales in comparison to the first
","For one, IT (2) feels more like a comedy than a horror. I found myself actually laughing in some of the scenes that I think were intended to be frightful. A prime example is when Beverly visits her old apartment that is now occupied by Mrs. Kersh. Suddenly, this sweet old lady transforms into a tall zombie woman that chases her through the halls. Another is when they are sitting around the table at the restaurant and their fortune cookies start hatching with monstrous creatures. It was laughable and so was the CGI.Also, where was Pennywise? One of my only complaints about the first one was the lack of screen time for Pennywise but in the sequel he has even LESS. He randomly appears a couple times during the three hour film and when he does, it's very brief. Except for the dragged out ending where he becomes a ginormous spider. Apart from the ending, a scene with Richie and one scene with Bill, the clown has pretty much no interaction with the adult members of the losers club.Henry Bowers? His character was literally useless and irrelevant in the movie. I honestly don't even know why they brought him back since he was believed to have died in the first one. He was only there to try and kill the main characters who ultimately kill him. No relevance to the plot. How did he even know where everyone would be? Oh right, he was being drove around by his zombie friend in a car.Overall, it was a decent sequel that fails to live up to the first. The opening scene with Adrian Mellon being murdered was by far the best scene in the film. That scene alone was very intense, brutal, and felt like a good opening to a horror film. Unfortunately, after that, it turns into more of a comedy.",5,4,6,8 September 2019
