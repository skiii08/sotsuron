Miracle," This Movie is Awesome
",Wow Miracle in my opinion is the best movie of the year! It was so well done I cant say that enough. The guys were so hott in this movie I had butterflies all in me. I love this movie it made me cry made me laugh (cone heads). My favorite scene is the Herby scene (again) it just brought the team together. My other favorite scene is when the team is in their locker room and Herb ask Ramsey who we are playing (Sweden). Then looks at Mac and they just start yelling at each other and Herb gets Mac all worked up and says that will get him going. I love that I wish Herb lived to see this awesome movie. Kurt Russell did an outstanding job. So thats all I have to say but if you haven't seen Miracle you should b/c if you love hockey you feel like one of they're teammates like your right there with them.
