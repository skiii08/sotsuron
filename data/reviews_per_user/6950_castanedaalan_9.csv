The Blair Witch Project," Chilling.
","It was pretty chilling but to be completely honest I didn't like it the first time. However, upon some research and a second time watching it, I ended up liking it and appreciating it more. There was no music but it strangely made it better. The acting was phenomenal too.",8,0,2,17 January 2019
Aquaman," Best DCEU film to date.
","The cinematography and the CGI is the best I've seen. Mind blowing stuff. The acting and the fight scenes were also fantastic, however, I disliked the music choices for certain scenes but I get that they were trying to make a 'fun' film not a 'dark' one. The acting was decent. This and Wonder Woman are very good!",7,3,7,24 December 2018
Bird Box," Way overhyped.
","While the cinematography and the music was alright, the story itself was decently interesting but chaotic. I found that most of the characters were annoying and stupid. This film had a lot of filler content that didn't need any explanation. We didn't need the relationship between the female protagonist and Tom. And we certainly didn't need an entire subplot for how Girl was born/adopted. Overall, this film was extremely overhyped. It is mediocre at best.",5,2,5,9 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Amazing and nostalgic!
","The voice-over acting, the music, the cinematography, the humor, the plot/story was good. VERY good. The antagonist felt real and genuine, and so did the wonderful characters and the protagonist, Miles Morales. The humor didn't feel weird but genuine as well. The comic booky animation made me feel nostalgic, making me remember when I first started reading comic books.",10,4,7,6 January 2019
The Exorcist," One the best horror films of all time.
","While the eeriness and horror aspect of this film does certainly deliver, it is more than just a movie that will give you the spooks. This film is about the absence of faith, and what can happen the moment you doubt or refuse to believe in God. (Still an atheist though haha). The cinematography, the acting, the iconic music, and the screenplay is simply perfect.",10,0,0,21 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," One of the greatest action-superhero films of all time.
","While a tiny bit of the CGI looked odd, the rest of the film was incredibly stunning. The screenplay and overall flow of the story and plot was very good. The handling of over +50 characters blowed my mind. The antagonist, Thanos, is arguably the best villain the mcu has so far. The cinematography and acting was amazing. I enjoyed the humor although sometimes I disliked it. Nonetheless, this was amazing.",9,0,3,6 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One Of The Best Films Of 2019.
","The story about a fading superstar and his stuntman wanting to revive their careers in the last moments of Hollywood's golden age is an awesome one. The cinematography is amazing, probably the best I've seen this year. The acting and music was amazing as well. There are a lot of scenes which may feel long and unnecessary but the payoff is well deserved. We're so conditioned as the audience to believe that action or something of significance needs to happen in every single scene in a movie, all while significantly rushing it, but this film shows that you can have slow-entertaining buildups with good execution. Sure, the scenes with Margot Robbie's character felt like a waste; it's really the only thing I disliked. The duo between Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth was amusing, natural, and overall dope. And man that ending, that ending was sick.",9,15,23,8 August 2019
The Witch," It was okay.
","The cinematography was good, the acting was fantastic, and the music was okay. And that's what this film is: okay. I enjoyed it and was entertained to a certain extent but I felt like it needed more. It was just tension building to scenes that didn't really pay off. Nonetheless, this film was worthy enough to watch.",6,1,1,24 December 2018
Joker," Masterpiece.
","This is cinema, forget what the Oscars have to say. I won't even get into the comparing game between Joaquin Phoenixs's take on the Joker vs Heath Ledger's. This film is living proof that a comic book character and story can dive deep into the psychological aspects of the human mind, all while telling the story of how the human psyche can deteriorate due to unfortunate accounts and circumstances. The cinematography has excellent composition. The acting is out of this world.
The music is haunting, gloomy, and dark. I've never thought that comic book (adaptation) films are just for entertainment. I'm a firm believer that with good storytelling you can make any comic book character interesting, relatable, and serious. I also couldn't help but to get a nerd-gasm when the little kid said his name was Bruce, and his parents' murder at the end of the film. This is a must watch.",10,1,1,11 October 2019
