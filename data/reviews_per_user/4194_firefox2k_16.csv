The Avengers," THIS is what an action movie should be like!!!
","I just LOVE this movie. A great action movie that will keep you on the edge the entire time. It was one heck of a feat to make sure all of the characters got enough time on the screen and they did this wonderfully. I am going to say this, do yourself a favor, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! bring the family too.I do have 2 problems with this movie. the first is the 'conflict' that is supposed to exist between the characters. From my view there was much of a 'conflict', just a difference of techniques or views. Second problem I have with the movie is that it was too short and there wasn't any cameos of any other characters that could have been involved with the film. (no spidey or wolverine or fantastic four involved in taking out an invading force?) Picky I know, but so much was great with this film, trying to find something bad with it was much harder.",9,4,9,7 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," set sail for bigger, more and better.
","The problem with creating a hit movie, is that people evidently expect you to create a sequel, which in turn create a new and unforeseen problem, where do we go from here?? Well in this sequel, I am grateful to say, that they had A lot of material to use and give people more of what they need to quench their thirst of what made them want more in the first place.This movie has its great points. more jokes, insane action, and over the top sequences. The most important aspect of the movie, it does have EXCELLENT content for plot, and great writing. Which allows for twist and turns, back story, and future productions.I have seen this movie 2 times, and each time i noticed something I didn't notice the first time around.I will give the movie a B+. some old gags and over the top antics kind of ruined it for me. But the story just grabs you by the throat and wont let go, I can't wait to see how it ends. ( I just wished they had Blackbeard or Cortez in the movie to increase the story)",8,0,1,9 July 2006
Justice League," Please, make the pain stop
","After dealing with months of speculation about how good or even great the potential of this film could have been, I am glad we have finally arrived at the moment I had predicted. This movie is OK, but no Avengers. The film seems like a bunch of scenes filmed separately and then put together to resemble a movie. The plot is weak and the villain is a CGI mess. Once again they gave Henry Cavill very little to do or say in this movie as well. Three movies into playing Superman and he has a total of about 60 lines. The good things I can say about the movie is that the individual characters were pretty decent. (However Ben's Batman leaves something to be desired. It seems he was just there to get a paycheck. Glad he is leaving the role.) There is a good fight sequence with the Amazons, and Ezra Millers Flash was entertaining. Do yourself a favor if you are reading this review and have not seen the movie yet, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE for this film.",5,1,6,18 November 2017
Man of Steel," Heroic, but not so Super. - warning spoilers
","I went to see this movie and something occurred to me during this what seems like 30 minute fight sceen towards the end of the movie. When you make a movie, and the protagonist has actual antagonist to deal with, you have to make the antagonist not be superior to the protagonist. It is a very delicate balancing act. We are talking about the strongest, fastest, and most powerful being on the earth, and we are supposed to believe he has an equal. Well he doesn't, if that equal is from earth. so what do you do, to create that fight and struggle, make sure the protagonist is from his same planet, and with his same powers. In the story, which you already know so well, Superman gets sent from his destroyed home planet to earth. Afterwards, the bad guys that were banished from his planet find him on earth to seek him for something they need. In one of the scenes in the movie, they send 12 of them to earth. 12, and yet, there is only 3 of them Superman has to deal with. WHY? Wouldn't you send all the might and power you had to destroy him and be over with it? Secondly, after this grand long-drawn out battle, the leader General Zod, dies in a very unimpressive, unheroic way. Which leaves people to say....ALL OF THAT fighting, and for what? Superman should have done that in the first place. I will give the movie 7 out of 10 stars simply because of the urgency to make it seem like superman has an real trouble or issues.I do like however a slight hint, or Easter egg planted in the movie during the fight scene. When Superman throws General Zod through a LEXCORP oil tanker. Good set up for the next movie.",7,0,1,16 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A decent beginning for a spectacular ending
","I just came from this movie and thought to myself, 'I wonder why they didn't take this approach in Goblet of Fire?' personally we ALL know this is for a money-making aspect and has nothing to do with, 'not being able to tell the story in one movie.' If they actually cared about telling the story correctly they would have made G.O.F into 2 movies.The movie was rushed, and it seemed that they literally took the best parts from each of the beginning chapters and threw them together. Many lines from the movie were taken from the book word for word, kind of a stretch for the other movies, when they tried to stress the point that it is a movie and not a book.I personally thought the casting or at least the makeup part of the many of the characters were done poorly as well. The Minister of Magic looked nothing liked the description in the book. Supposedly he was a built rugged looking man with a lion manned hair,but they made him a tall scrawny guy who needed a meal or two. Mundungus Fletcher, Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf,not a reject from the sex-pistols. Bill Weasley is stated as tall ruggedly handsome and athletic, not thin skinny emo rocker.I love the ideal of filming in the 'real world' however the sets left something to be desired. they seemed very small, crowded and not realistic to be taken as a 'real world' Gordics Hollow looked like a sound stage, as well did the Lovegoods and Malfoy manor. They could have at least rented a nice mansion in Louisiana for Malfoy Manor.I have to give the movie a 6 out of 10. I have to be more critical of this due to the fact that they should have all of the aspects down by now after all these movies. I will say as far as all the movies in the series goes, this one would be in the top 3...so far...not as good as Order of the Phoenix or Sorcerers Stone but better than Goblet of Fire, depending on how it ends.",6,1,2,20 November 2010
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A movie for movie lovers
","This movie is an experience to be enjoyed by people who love movies and a great over-all experience.
The traditional 2D animation mixed in with computer animation and cell shading technique is something that you have possibly never seen before.
The story is easy to follow because they explain it as the movie goes along, so you do NOT have to know about the comic books or much about this particular version of Spider-man.
Do yourself a favor and try to see this on a big screen such as IMAX. I saw it in 3-D and I can say it does add to the experience.
This movie is definitely in the running for not just best animated movie, but best movie of the year.",9,10,25,14 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Where is the magic? not in this movie!
","This will be the definitive review for the movie.When doing a movie based on a book, you should make the movie follow the book as close as possible. granted you can not put everything in the book in a movie, but you do have to remember that a movie should and DOES tell a story. 4 crucial points which are VERY important to this movie being part of a 7 part series. A movie is plot, dialog, shooting, editing, wardrobe, scenery and most importantly supposed to stand alone. The first 2 movies by Chris do that. People say they were long, boring, and had no imagination. BUT they were the best movies made from a book. ( except LOTR and silence of the lambs )1. Who are the marauders? What is their importance in the next 4 movies? 2. Who is Prongs? what role does he play? 3. Why is hermonie's 'cat' important ? 4. who are cedric diggory and cho chang?Watching the movie, those will be things you can NOT answer. Being a reader of the books, you can. Why is this important? because they ALL play BIG ROLES in the next 2 movies!!The movie was sliced, diced, and minced. It looked like a stage play. or a rehearsal for a movie that wasn't finished. The edits were bad, the camera shook.It was a great creative art film, with great actors, and a nice LOOSE interpretation of the book. But as far as i am concerned, not a movie that should be considered part of the series. ( kind of like the second parts to the Wizard of Oz, or Gone with the Wind...LOL)P.S. - noticed the quotes around the word 'cat'... HINT! HINT! Do yourself a favor and read the books if you want to know how much you REALLY MISSED, and well as the director.",1,2,4,10 June 2004
Ghost Rider," A Fun time and feel good story
","I had my reservations about this movie. it was in the works for a long time and i was really surprised when they finally put it together. I had my reservations about Nick Cage playing the lead, but he really pulled it off. The special effects and story were good, and solid, to make a good comic book movie. ( MUCH BETTER than x-men 3 and the HULK )This is a good movie i would recommend to anyone to go see with some friends, just to have a good time. It has a good flow, the depth of the story is good, and the action is well done.I would like to see a sequel, which obviously will happen with the great opening it has had. I just hope they spend just a little more time with the villains, and a tighter storyline.",7,2,3,18 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Mutants can be mortals too
","I, like everyone who was a great fan of the first 2 movies, was very nervous when noting the change of director for this movie. When this happen it is usually a sign of disaster. This time, it was NOT the directors fault, it was the writers fault in the horrible completion of the trilogy. They had absolutely NO IDEAL how they wanted to end this. As my definitive movie review continues, I will rate the movie as a movie and try to explain the movie as related to the comic book. The movie was OK, I will give it a C, and I am being VERY nice about that rating. The beginning was good, and the original baseline plot for the movie was good as well, then things get really out of hand. Too many mutants doing too many things, and not enough focus on ONE plot. During the middle of the movie it jumps around and you feel like they rushed it, in which they did. According to official time the movie was only 1 hour and 44 minutes long. Exactly the same time as the first x-men movie, which was excellent, however they needed to focus the story and should have made it at least a 2 and a half hours, to tell one story correctly. Now, as a movie translation based upon from the books, It gets an F. I purchased x-men number one, and numerous spin-off x-men comics. The movie takes 'The Phoenix Saga' and mixes it with 'The Coming of Apocalypse'. Those who know and love the comic know what I speak of. The Phoenix Saga is arguably the best-written saga ever for a comic book series. For those of you who have NOT read this, please do so for a MUCH better explanation of part of the movie they were trying to create. If you decide to go see this movie, do yourself a favor and read the comic saga first, then judge the movie fairy, you wont be able to fault the director on this one.",3,1,2,27 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Compelling tale, very refreshing movie
","The definitive review is back! Yes folks, here we are again, and once again i have to tell the story in 2 parts. First for the people who have read the book and the people who will just go watch the movie, but never read the book.First for the people who have read the book. This movie was made just about as good as you can make it. Phoenix is the largest book in the series, and possibly the most boring read of all the books. i think the movie would have been better had it been 20 minutes longer. the scene i most wanted to see was omitted which was the scene in the book involving neville and his parents in the hospital. but aside from that they pretty much crammed just about everything in by performing 2 lines from each character on each page.For the people who just will watch the movie. The tempo was nice, but felt a little rushed. the set design was good, and it is good to see the actors improve a little more each movie. ( i am thinking still that Emma Watson is still the strongest actor of the trio) the interaction between the rest of the cast is nice, however all the adult actors roles have been limited to small bits and pieces, the kids pretty much have the movie.Overall, as a movie it was a B-, as a book to movie translation i give it a B- as well.",9,0,5,11 July 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The laughs and adventure pumped up by 10!
","Greetings! Just came from a double-feature showing of the Guardians movies, Volume 1 and 2 together. In doing this I got to compare the first and the second movie with them both freshly in my mind, and I will say Vol 2 is the BETTER of the two movies. The first movie did introduce us to this universe and these characters, so therefore you will hear some people 'professional critics' complain that Volume 2 isn't as 'fresh' and the first movie. Well they are idiots for saying that because the first movie was the introduction to characters most people have never heard of. Remember when the first trailer came out and many people were like 'who the heck are these people? is Marvel pulling our leg?'. Volume 2 gets to get right into the action and the story without having to re-introduce all the characters again. The movie has bigger and better laughs and some very touching moments. The stand out characters in this film are definitely Yondu and Nebula. You find out what drives them and what shapes them and their life. The only downside to the movie is although it is 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it seems to go by way to quickly and I would have loved for it to have 20 minutes longer.",8,5,12,4 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," A great book and a wonderful movie.
","There comes a time where people's beliefs and perceptions come into question. There also is a moment in life where ideals are challenged and any questions of an objectionable nature are considered bad, evil and immoral. If you think I am talking about the Da Vinci code movie, you are correct. If you think I am talking about if the statements and ideals for the book are based on facts or fiction, then you SERIOUSLY NEED HELP!! I will put a disclaimer on this review, which will be, for all you religious nuts out there, Dan Brown's book is listed in the FICTION section of the library or bookstore. Now, back to my original train of thought. When I first heard about the book being made into a movie, I had seen the trouble that was to come along with it. I knew religious people would bash it, critics would hate it, and even fans of the book might rebel against it. I was glad to see that Ron Howard would be making this great book into a movie. I was disappointed to have Tom Hanks playing the lead role, because while I was watching the movie, all I kept seeing was Tom Hanks. It would have been even better if they had cast an unknown or little known actor for the role, because many people didn't actually SEE the movie, they just WATCHED the movie. So my definitive review of the movie goes as stated. As a movie to book translation, it was an: A-. The lighting was great, the music was great, the set design was great. They kept the movie just about exactly as I pictured it reading the book. (note to Alfonso Curon who did that piece of crap Harry Potter movieTHIS IS HOW you make a movie based on a popular book.) The only thing that kept it from being an A-plus, was casting a big star in the lead role. It was very hard watching this movie without saying, 'look it's Tom Hanks' As a movie just for people to watch and enjoy, I give it a: B. it reminded me of Raiders of the lost Ark. Sure it didn't have the dramatic, unrealistic adventure scenes, but the movie REALLY grabs you when they explain about 'the holy grail'. I am TRULY glad I didn't listen to all the critics ( who never saw the movie. Honestly if you call yourself a critic or are on a committee who is voting for an award of some type GO WATCH THE MOVIE before 'reviewing' or 'casting ballots' ( personally I am still raving mad over the idiots who thought Brokeback Mountain was a good movie. Crash won best picture for a reason. A better movie, and not a call or cry for gay people to try an speak out. )",9,0,1,27 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Magical memories should not be rushed but savored
","Harry Potter and the goblet of fire, happens to be what most movie fans care to see when going to a movie based on a book. Mind you it is NOWHERE near perfect, but a GREAT and WONDERFUL delight to the HORRBILE, and devastating catastrophe that was created last year. Thank god Warner Brothers has possibly stopped hiring third rated independent directors to film a franchise movie series such as this. For people who have just tuned in to join us, my last and wonderful review helped a lot of people. I write my reviews for the non-potter lovers and followers. people who have yet to read the wonderful books, and thought that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie.P.o.a., or as i think it should be named, ( a LOOSE interpretation of Harry potter. or P.O.S. for short.), was by far the worst movie made last year. Why you may ask, if you can answer these two questions you will know why there was a great , and tremendous task lying ahead of Mike Newell for this far better film. 1. who is Cedric Diggory, 2. who is Cho Chang. These are all questions that should have been answered but were totally omitted in the last film! So, Mike Newell has a tremendous task to catch us up to speed on the answers to these questions.Daniel Radcliff gives us a much better performance, only to have it highly topped by Emily Watson, who shined like a jewel. I cant wait to see these 2 in there upcoming non-potter films. Ruppert Grint gives us an OK performance, only due to bad writing all he pretty much gets to say is( 'bloody hell', and 'no way') Michael Gambon was dramatically better as Dumbledore in this film. No longer a bumbling biker dude but a true headmaster.The one gleaming highlight that i love about films like these is the need to find new people to play new characters who will fit in great with the older cast members. we have the introduction of Stanislav Ianevski, who plays the Bulgarian quidditch star and student of Durmstang, as Viktor Krum (has all of 6 words in the movie). next we have Robert Pattinson who plays the charming and likable, Cedric Diggory( cant wait till he gets a lead in a movie, i see him as the next Pierce Brosnan, 20 years from now the next James Bond actually.)((2009 update - i see Robert already has great career with Twilight, glad to see my predictions coming true!)) Then there is Clémence Poésy who plays Fleur Delacour, Ron's big crush from Beau Baton Academy( she has all of 20 words ). Last and not least of the newcomers of the younger cast, Katie Leung , who plays a delightful Cho Chang, Harry's first crush and opposing house quidditch team seeker. For the adult cast we have the extremely talented Miranda Richardson (her part should have been extended to show the torment she had in Harry's year). last but not least we have the chilling, Ralph Fiennes, playing 'the bad dude'. (he was very well at playing Lord Voldemort, but once again, his scene was rushed and should have been extended)The cinematography was MUCH better than POA( which looked like one long art-house film/ gap commercial. microphones and other flaws seen throughout the film.) The set design was excellent.( even thought they use then NEW style of Hogwarts from POA, which in POA looked more like a church graveyard than a castle of grandeur) They should revert back to the older Hogwarts in the next movies. Although the use of colors is extremely apparent in the film. Even in the Hogwarts uniforms ( YES! they actually wore the uniforms in the movie, no more gap jeans and t-shirts like POA) which made it much easier to feel like Hogwarts.The other bad part of the movie, was the mispronounces of some of the magic words and names that they use in the film. my suggestion would be that they should have the actors NOT say the words, and just point their wands, and let the action happen.( as a potter fan it makes me cringe when magic words or names are mispronounced. plus as a rule of magic, that can lead to terrible results. LOL)For a book to movie translation, i give this one a C-. Much better than POA, but nowhere as good as the first two movies. The movie was rushed, and should have been extended for and hour more. or as was first presented to Warner brothers two separate 2 hour movies. ( if your going to do it, do it right. ) there were no Dursleys,which would have been funny as hell to see the Weasleys meet the Dursleys. They could have show that, and would have made the movie 5 minutes longer. absolutely NO QUIDDITCH, from the world cup?!? what is going on here?!? THAT would have been something people would have talked about for weeks. And the omission of Ludo Bagman from the movie?!?! what gives?For a movie for people to go watch for entertainment, i give it a B- . This movie really, truly had the potential to be a movie of the year type film. Once again, TOO RUSHED. everyone will agree to this once you see the movie. Also you never get a chance to get into the characters. or the intensity of the storyline (why cant more people take a hint from Lord of the Rings?!? 11 Oscars isn't BAD, since it was only nominated for 11) millions of fans, moviegoers, and critics CAN'T be THAT wrong.",7,0,1,18 November 2005
Inception," Some dream are really nightmares, like this movie
","I am sorry i was forced to see this film. ( i was on a date and they were 15 minutes late for the movie i wanted to see.)The story is is predictable. the ending is very predictable if you pay attention to the first 6 minutes of the film. The one thing you never do in a mystery books is let the reader get ahead of you, same goes for a movie. The viewer should never know the ending before the movie barely begins. The acting in this film is fine, most of the actors really shine in this movie BUT Leo. I use to love Leo when he was 13, but now he is an adult, and his acting hasn't dramatically improved in all these years.I would say this is going down as one of the worst movies I have seen so far this year, but there were 2 other movies that would win that title.I would recommend for anyone wanting to see this film to wait for DVD or Cable. It just isn't worth the time.",5,7,20,17 July 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," A Dark Knight rises above the others!!
","Sometimes, when you hear a sequel will be made to an excellent movie,you dread the worst, and it makes your body cringe in fear. You say to yourself 'WHY, WHY, WHY...run the risk of messing with perfection'. Then the sequel will come out and it actually is really good, possibly better than the original. This movie, BY FAR, is better than it's 2 previous films. The acting is superb, the action scenes suspenseful, and the drama unfolds like origami figure. They do a great job of telling each characters story to where you actually can feel and relate to everyone in the movie, even the 'bad guy'. This movie is one of those must see films. I have to give it a 9 out of 10 due to the MASSIVE 3 or 4 plot holes, but hey, this is fantasy and we sometimes can allow for certain gaps in storyline.",8,4,9,21 July 2012
300," I am spartan...hear me roar!!
","Here we are again. the definitive review is back.I have been salivating to see this movie ever since I saw the teaser for it on the apple quicktime movie trailer site.It was well worth the wait, so much in fact, I have seen the movie 2 times, and am going back for a 3rd. The first was a plain old movie theater. the second was at a state of the art theater, in DLP surround sound. Next THE IMAX....OH YES!!You will walk into this movie going, what is this about, but when you leave the movie, your chest will swell, your arms will pump, and you will scream at the top of your lungs ' I AM A SPARTAN, HEAR ME ROAR ' and you will get a rush of invincibility about you.The camera angles put your pretty much right in the movie and involve you. at some points you feel like the actors are speaking to you.The plot of the movie is based on history and legend with a twist of carnival side show. you will understand when you see some of the army members in the movie.The flow of the movie changes, it speeds up, slows down, and pauses. the best thing of the movie the MUSIC and SOUNDS. this movie WILL WIN the Oscar for sound hands down. it is an excellent piece of work.I have been reading about how they showed the movie in Sparta, and some people were offended at the violence, and complaining that the movie shows the Spartans as blood-thirsty warriors, with no care for life. This is total BS, it is a movie our Marines would be proud of. Honor, glory, love, courage in the face of death. protecting your love ones from slavery, and oppression. I know it may not be nominated for anything but the scientific subjects, light, sounds, costumes, art direction, etc..but it will be a masterpiece many would love to own, and will own in their ultimate DVD collection.",10,1,6,10 March 2007
