The Blair Witch Project," I'm Impressed
","It takes a lot to impress me. I have been doing local and school theatre for years, so I know what it takes to get into a role. The cast in this movie was excellent. From their actions and words and movements, you felt as if it was happening at that moment and you were right in it. People said it was scary, 'scary movies' are like Scream and IKWYDLS, because they use sudden actions and loud and flashy effects to scare the audience. This movie was frightening. Frightening is an overall effect that comes from a movie that is consistently and thouroughly depicted to give the audience that feeling inside that that sends a shiver up your spine. I know this movie got mixed reviews, mainly because people went into the theatre telling themselves that this could not scare them. Anyone can make themselves unafraid in a movie, it's the people who go into it thinking that this could very possibly scare them that truly appreciate the film. If you give the movie a chance, you will have pleasent, or rather frightening, experience.",9,1,2,6 August 1999
