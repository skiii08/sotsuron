Casablanca," old world charm
",Have watched this movie at-least 10 times and always a delight to watch. Now I have watched it so many times that I skip over not so great moments and jump to moments which make it what it is.One thing which stands out is the aristocratic or etiquettes which the characters display is old world charm. The representative of Nazis meeting Laszlo in such courteous manner. Similarly exchange between Rick and prefect in such terse one liner dialogues. No abuses or cuss words just genteel threats.,10,0,0,31 March 2020
