United 93," 'It's Time'
","Some people question if this movie is 'too soon.' The first line in the movie, stated by one of the terrorists, is 'It's time.' I believe this depends on the person. Certain parts of the movie were difficult to watch because I didn't want to sob in front of other people. Usually, I can go to that place in my mind and tell myself, 'It's only a movie.' That little trick can't be used in this film because it's about truth . . . and remembrance. If I saw this movie 10 years from Sept. 11, 2001, instead of last Saturday, I'd still react and feel the same way. It was thought provoking and long after the movie was over, it was still on my mind. For me, this movie turned Sept. 11th into more than a day of terror. It turned Sept. 11th, 2001 into a day of heroics. I was filled with sadness, anger, respect and pride. I will make this film a part of my Memorial Day, every year.",10,1,4,9 May 2006
