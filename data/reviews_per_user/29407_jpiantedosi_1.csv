Hereditary," Not the ending I expected, in a bad way.
","I honestly thought this was going to be a movie about schizophrenia. The opening scene has us looking into the miniaturized version of Annie's world, like we're looking at the world she created rather than reality. Then we learn about her family history of DID and schizophrenia. And, in the end, it turns out to be just another movie about cults and satanic worship? I don't understand the hype. What was a good movie lost it for me in the last 20 minutes or so.",3,3,10,22 June 2019
