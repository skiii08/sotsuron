The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Breaking Dawn - Disappointed.
","I like Breaking Dawn, the book! Read it like a gazillion times. I was waiting for the movie for a long time, I am not a 'Twiheart' but, I enjoyed the books and the movies, so far. But... What was that?? I mean..Writer Melissa Rosenberg ruined the movie for me. I was waiting to see Charlies reaction when Bella & Edward told him that they are getting married. Nothing! It was one of the scenes I wanted so much to see! (I love Charlie) She didn't add crucial scenes, like the one Edward is the man who burns in frond of Jake, and he asks him crazy stuff to save Bella, the real bonding of Liah and Jake, Jake tries to Inprint on the first girl he sees in that park, to forget his love for Bella. He was supposed to 'shine' in this part, honesty, didn't see that. And the part that he claims the Leadership, to be the Alpha..My God it was so Cheesy and cartoon like! The imprint, I liked it, but I was so simple! Didn't like also that the Pack attacked the Cullens, that doesn't happen! One last thing I hated, was Bellas burning. In the book, she hang on, thinking of all the people she love, but all we see in the movie is blood, cells and probably, the venom! If you haven't read the books, and you will see the burning scene, you can't understand what the heck is going on! The point of splitting one book, in two movies, is that you can give the fans all that they anticipated. Yea, didn't happen for me. The stuff I actually like, have nothing to do with the awful writing of Melissa Rosenberg. It was the part of Bella looking all skinny and fragile, and the scene that she turns. Her face turned gracefully. Props to that, very good job. Hope Part 2 is better than the first one.I wanted so much to like it, but unfortunately I didn't. Thank you for reading it, tell me what you think!",3,7,8,12 December 2011
