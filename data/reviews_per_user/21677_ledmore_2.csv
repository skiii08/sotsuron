Alien 3," Watch the directors cut please...
","It's David Fincher. And a really good cast that got railroaded by the execs. I was a little disappointed in '91, and glad a directors cut came out. Bravo, great addition.",10,5,8,15 August 2018
Armageddon," It IS entertainment
","Man, I hope some of you yahoo's read this.  Armageddon is a great film.  And I know I'm blowing wind up your skirt now, with all the baloney's coming my way.  First of all, I want to say cheers to the many who agree.  And now my why: It is an entertainment movie.  For all of you who have seen this and expected something serious, and Oscar worthy, Buuuu!  That is your folly. This movie is great action, well placed humor, interesting settings and scenery, great special Fx, and some good jokes/messages about life of today. How else can mankind tackle an astronomical problem but with the help of all the world?  Yeah, some flag waving, but if this movie was made in Italy, I'm sure they would have the right to display their tricolor as well. Did I say anything about great acting?  No.  But I will say actors like Buscemi, Patton and Stormere deserve kudos. Plainly, this movie is fun.  It can be watched over and over.  It has good emotional value, and Michael Bay's style of directing is at times misunderstood.  At first, I found the pacing and quick cuts distracting, but that is exactly what this movie underlines; the quick time frame it all takes place in.  It is a trademark of Bay's, noticible in other films, that give this film and others their pace.  He is precise and curt, but manages to add in the subtle (upsidedown flag on Mir, the little skull head on the Armadillo's stick) points and views that make this a great film.So go ahead and rip on it, refuse to watch it.  Your loss. This is not the best film ever, but it is well done and good entertainment.",10,1,2,27 April 2004
