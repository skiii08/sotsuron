The Ring," Not bad, somewhat derivative
","Can style make up for weak material? Only so much. Basically, it's a junior high campfire story done up as a 'Sixth Sense' wannabe, with a dash of 'Blair Witch' and some throw-away Hitchcock references. I give the movie credit for using scary atmospherics instead of continual gross-outs and 'Boo!' moments, but sometimes it was just plain slow. It also dragged on too long, and I was tired of the movie and checking the time before the movie finally decided to call it a day.The Hitchcock references gave me a chuckle of recognition, but at the same time they seemed like an overly self-conscious display of style, just like the odd coloring throughout the film.If your standard of horror consists of slasher flicks, this movie is going to look pretty good, a cut above the rest. If your standards are higher, this movie will probably seem like an also-ran. The movie tries hard, but it also has too many copycat elements.",6,0,1,1 June 2003
Erin Brockovich," Not bad, some flaws
","The movie started off very slowly. I was wondering when they'd get around to an actual story. Once the main plot kicked in, the movie hung together pretty well.Positive Stuff: Julia Roberts and Albert Finney did pretty well. I was glad when they showed (in Ed Masry) that Erin wasn't the _only_ person with any competence.Negative Stuff: First, how many unemployed bikers do you know who are polite and gentle, handy around the house, and good baby-sitters to boot? And then their biker friends just vanish? This all seemed awfully conveeeeenient. Then the movie trotted out the cliche that corporations are evil and that an in-your-face attitude is worth more than an education and practical experience. Basically, the movie tells a very one-sided story.Underutilized Actress: Conchata Ferrell, who showed a lot of promise way back in the TV series 'HOT L Baltimore,' but who always seems to wind up in minor roles.",Null,0,1,3 September 2000
Memento," Cleverly done, but not 9th greatest
","As I write this, Memento holds IMDB's 9th spot on the IMDB Top 250 list. This movie is NOT the 9th-greatest film ever made. It's a gimmick film, cleverly done with nice atmospherics and several plot surprises, but still a gimmick film. This seems like a case of 'IMDB Syndrome' -- a tendency to vote at the extremes for recent movies, especially the gimmicky or culty movies. IMO, the voting on any movie in IMDB is not to be taken too seriously until at least two years after the movie's release.The movie's not bad, basically a brief scene at the beginning with a chain of flashbacks until the movie stops. Though the setting is different, the premise is very much like the Gene Wolfe novel, Soldier of the Mist.Few questions are answered (deliberately it would seem), so if you like nice tidy endings, this isn't the movie for you. If you like movies that require that you pay attention at every moment and that make you reconstruct storylines in your head while you watch, you'll probably like this.The movie did a good job of presenting the POV of someone whose memory is perpetually slipping away, and who can never be sure of what's going on around him.Eventually, the series of flashbacks was starting to get a little old, and I found myself thinking, 'Isn't it about time for you guys to wrap this up?' The movie was starting to feel padded.But overall, not a bad movie.",7,0,2,20 October 2001
Zulu," 'Hookie'
","Others have already described the movie's good use of sound, its willingness to portray the Zulus as something other than a pack of ignorant savages, and its ability to create tension.I'll add one more comment. I couldn't help but think that Private Henry Hook ('Hookie'), as portrayed in the movie, was actually Harry Flashman in disguise. ;-) Flashy would have been older than that by that time, but hey. (For those not familiar with Harry Flashman, dig up the series of novels by George Macdonald Fraser starting with _Flashman_. _Flashman and the Tiger_ touches on incidents related to this movie, portraying Flashy in his later years.)",7,1,8,17 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Better than a terrible kung-fu movie
","I was astonished to see that nearly half the voters on this movie gave it 10/10. Or maybe I shouldn't be astonished. I never trust IMDB scores on recent movies, because there seem to be IMDB junkies out there who immediately declare whatever movie they just saw the greatest thing they've ever seen, 10 out of 10, or the worst thing they've ever seen, 1 out of 10.I will grant that the fight scenes were nicely done, and the film _looked_ very nice. But it still had quite a bit in common with cheesy martial arts movies -- secret identities obvious from the start, disguises obvious to everyone except the characters in the movie, the outlaw who was coarse and manly but also kind and who didn't really want to be an outlaw anyway and he was in love with a rich girl, the clownish oafs you know are about to get creamed, and a nation where it seems every living breathing person is a martial arts expert to some degree.I read one review that mentioned the convoluted plot twists. What twists?? The movie barely had any discernible plot. The ostensible bad guy (Jade Fox) seemed like a minor character -- no buildup, no establishment of why or how she was so bad, no demonstration or even explanation of how the antagonism developed between her and the heroes. There was the extended flashback that was waaaay too long, and didn't contribute to the overall story. I suppose it was supposed to say something about the character Jen, but all it said was that she had a peculiar but unexplained obsession over an everyday object that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie.There was the death scene in which the character involved (I'll avoid a spoiler here) proclaimed the 'last breath' had arrived and flopped over. Dead? Naah, still alive. Then there seemed to be another final moment. Dead yet? Naah, still going. This time? Naah, still there.There was the other death that looked frankly silly. Seeing that character with the blade mounted on his forehead seemed fake and comical, not tragic or horrifying.I wasn't bothered like some over the lack of realism in the fights -- running on walls, flying, and all that. It was a fantasy, okay? That aspect didn't bother me.Overall, this movie was indeed better than your basic cheesy martial arts flick, but that's not saying much.",5,0,0,16 June 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Noisy, cluttered, unengaging
","This movie was awful. It had the non-stop noise of a bad cartoon. The rehash of past songs wasn't clever or hip, just second-hand and out of place. The 'actors' didn't act, they postured and mugged. The movie used the shallow and unfocused techniques of a run-of-the-mill music video and extended them to movie length.I was ready to give up on the movie roughly 10-15 minutes into it, but I kept trying to hold on, hoping that something good would appear. No luck. I finally bailed out, apparently not long before the movie would have ended anyway.Terrible waste of time.",3,0,2,26 February 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Oz? Diversity?
","This movie wasn't what I expected, and I wound up enjoying it far more than I expected. The non-stop humor and the surprise-a-minute action were great fun. All the references to The Odyssey were fun, especially the teasers where they led you to think one thing would happen (to follow The Odyssey's story), then gave it a twist to keep you on your toes. I never expected to enjoy 'old-timey' music that much either. All the characters were done well, and you really got the impression that almost every actor in the movie was having an awful lot of fun.The Klan scenes seemed awfully reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz (the oh-wee-oh guys etc.). It seemed like a deliberate reference.I was also struck by the amount of racial tolerance displayed in the movie. So often, movie-makers paint a picture that suggests everyone in the South before the civil rights movement either was a Klansman or supported the Klan. This movie bucks that stereotype by making the Klan into a disliked lunatic fringe.Anyway, the movie was great fun!",9,0,0,8 October 2001
