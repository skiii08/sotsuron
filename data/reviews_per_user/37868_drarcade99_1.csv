Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great story, poor execution really...
","I'm giving this a 6 out of 10. I had to really consider my review as I graded it. The reminder for the reader is that the 6 of 10 isn't inherently bad and some of the criticisms might not really matter to you so feel free to add #'s to my value.I had the privilege of reading the book prior to the movie release. I have to emphasize that the book really is fantastic and well-written. The author's sense of pace and fluidity is great!That being said, the movie tries to mimic some parts of the storyline but naturally misses a bunch of major plot elements. While I know all book-to-film adaptations suffer this issue, I feel the movie's plot is a bit nebulous due to some elements being left out. What really sticks out in my mind is the reason why Abe returned to wed Mary after Josh Speed emphasize that he cannot let his distaste for Mary's father's business. Instead, they removed that component entirely and it ends up making Mr. Speed's character a little odd in the movie. I had a hard time understanding exactly what he's doing?Another really major component I felt the movie missed was the real explanation of why the vampires aligned with the South. In the book, it was a rather grotesques scene where a vampire purchased 'undesired slaves' at a slave auction and took them to a barn to dine on between the vampire and his buddies. The book almost added a complexity to this by Abe's noticing that the vampire would only bid on 'lame young boys or elderly women' to dine on. I just feel the movie really didn't set the situation up to understand what really drives Abe's later actions as President. Similarly, they relegated Henry's rather charismatic character in the book to what seemed to be a troubled counter- revolutionary vampire? Now that I criticized the movie for its content, I would definitely say the movie is, in itself, an enjoyable one. The fight scenes were a little unbelievable but frankly if you're concerned of the believability of a fight scene when one of the parties is a vampire, then it's fair to say that you're being unreasonable. In themselves, the fights scenes were fun and 'kick-ass' if I may. I saw the 3D version... it was mediocre.This movie might be better suited as one you'd buy and watch at home from time to time for some mildly silly but kinda inspirational period action film.The acting was actually pretty good. I feel the director fumbled on this one. In conclusion, I will say, I recommend everyone definitely read the book if you liked the movie. The book is quite fantastic and adds several layers of complexity to the story. I give 6 out of 10... not because it's a bad movie... but it took on too much. P.S. As a final note because I read it in a fellow reviewer's comment: this movie is absolutely not racist in the least. In fact, the movie diluted more frank talk in the book of racism that pervaded the south. That statement by a fellow reviewer is complete poppycock.",6,3,5,24 June 2012
