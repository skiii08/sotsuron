Requiem for a Dream," Words are not enough
","'Requiem for a Dream' by far, is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. This film is a must see for all people who are or have struggled with addictions or who know someone with an addiction. Being a person of the former, I have never been able to put to words my  memories of such indescribable torments that have plagued my inner most mind and soul. This film captures the essence of the hell we call addiction and it does it with such accuracy that it made me feel like I revisited that place, again.This is film making brilliance and a true work of art.",Null,0,0,13 January 2003
