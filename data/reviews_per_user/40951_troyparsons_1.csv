Scarface," Great film!!!
","Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around.Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great.Even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time (not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct) it is still easy to follow along. But you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. Personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it is really just that great!Enjoy the film and make sure you post your review here too!",8,0,2,17 August 2012
