Insidious: Chapter 2," Great sequel, even if it doesn't completely live up to the first one.
","While the first 'Insidious' took a much more chilling and slow way to get the scares, the sequel is a tad bit different in that sense. Don't get me wrong, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is great horror movie fare. I just feel it could've been scarier.The sequel keeps the promise of it's title (something many movies in our time fail to even do). The movie starts off right at the end of the first one and it continues the story of the Lambert family. Things seem to be calm now, life is finally back to normal for them. However, things get weird when the noises start up again along with some violent outbursts from some unfriendly guests. Yet this isn't even the worst of their problems. One certain family member seems to be losing his mind as he mutters to himself while acting completely out of character. Is something wrong with dad? One of the few things I had mixed feelings about in the first movie was the place called 'The Further.' It was definitely something of a new element compared to other recent haunted house movies, however, I just felt they didn't expand on the idea as much as they could've in the original. Happily though, they fix that in this movie. 'The Further' is made as a much bigger part in this movie and the potential it has was finally used. You get to see some very interesting things (makeshift breadcrumbs for being lost, finding a world among the dead never seen before, and even answering questions you never realized you had). All in all, I was very happy with the much better use of 'The Further.' Also the acting was fantastic. The actors were definitely pushed to take their characters to new places. The father becoming insane (almost 'Shining' like), the wife becoming a fighter, and the son (comatose for most of the first movie) becoming the kind of 'man of the house' while his father is losing it. So having great acting was definitely a nice plus. After all, how many horror movies can say they had actors who could hold your attention without any sex scenes? Sadly, there are some negatives. Maybe I'm just biased in favor of the original in this circumstance but I feel this movie was not as chilling as the first one. The first movie was very chilling so the standards were already high but I can't help but feel disappointed. However, there were some nice scare scenes that you would not see coming as well as an intense climax that will take your breath away.Over all, this is a very fine addition to the inevitable franchise that is to come. Usually sequels to horror movies are terrible but this one actually did very well. It might not have been as scary as the first but it made up for that with great acting, nicely written script, nice atmosphere and intense climax. Enjoy this movie while it lasts (after all, it won't be long before we have 'Insidious: Book 4 Chapter 6' along with 'Paranormal Activity 20').",8,1,2,17 October 2013
Gravity," One of the Best Movies of the Year!
","In a society where the success of media is determined by how much money is gotten from the overuse of 3D, it can be very refreshing to find a movie that has 3D but does not let it take over. This is probably one of the greatest strengths of 'Gravity.' 'Gravity' takes place in (you guessed it) space and it surrounds the experiences of two astronauts (Sandra Bullock and George Clooney). When disaster strikes they find themselves stranded in the middle of space and must find a way back to Earth.Sounds like a simple idea, but that is the genius of it. There is nothing complicated about the story, doesn't try adding some deep message about politics, society, or anything like that. No, the message is skillfully present in the movie without feeling forced because the filmmakers let the story play out. I am sure there was a great temptation to make the moral of the story as obvious as the sun in the middle of the day but they didn't. That alone is worthy of praise.Another thing worthy of praise must go straight to Alfonso Cuaron. He is without a doubt one of the best directors of our time. He masterfully created a film with spellbinding beauty mixed with awe-inspiring terror. All the while he didn't lose focus of what this story is really about, the will of the human spirit.Yet much of the credit must go to the leading actors: George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Both did fantastic jobs but it is Bullock who should get most of the praise. This was definitely her best performance to date. She portrayed the vulnerability, strength, and pure terror of a woman trapped in a situation where hope is gone. Such a role demands an actress in the highest of standards and Bullock proved she was deserving of the role. At this point she is a deadlock for the nomination for best leading actress and I will not be surprised if she wins. She was absolutely phenomenal.Yet there is one aspect that this film is almost guaranteed to win at the Oscars: special effects. Watching this movie made me feel like I was truly in space and experiencing every feeling these characters were feeling. Rarely have I ever been absolutely star struck by just the visuals of a film. The last time I felt this immersed in a film was when 'Avatar' came out but I didn't see that in 3D. I am one who views 3D as nothing but a gimmick. However, when I saw 'Gravity' in 3D I knew there was still hope for it. This was one of those rare times where 3D added to the experience of seeing a movie and not detract from it. Absolutely gorgeous movie on every scale.So in the end, 'Gravity' takes a simple idea and shows how sometimes the simplest idea is the better way to go. This was all thanks to masterful direction, fantastic acting, beautiful visuals, and wonderful writing. A great testament to the will of the human spirit; I will not be surprised if it wins Best Picture.",10,3,6,25 November 2013
Coraline," A beautiful masterpiece in every sense of the word.
","Coraline brings back Henry Selick (director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach) to direct this amazingly scary enchantment. Coraline is full of wonders that you wouldn't expect to see in any ordinary movie. It is exciting, fun, somewhat scary but for all its worth an amazing thrill ride. Coraline is a movie where you truly have to appreciate art. For Coraline you have to use your mind to understand some of the visionary art that is used in this movie. For example, in this movie you will see a mouse circus. That doesn't sound like much, but when you see it you won't believe your eyes. Coraline is a movie that little kids probably wouldn't want to see (probably because of the scary scenes). But it is still a great movie that just about anyone could enjoy (espically with the 3D). When it comes down to visionary art, great story, an amazing cast, and something thats a little dark so adults could get into it. Then watch Coraline, with Henry Selick being the director he won't let you down. Like I said earlier Coraline isn't any ordinary movie its better.",10,1,3,7 November 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron Man isn't rusty.
","You know summer has begun when studios release the first summer blockbuster of the year. Iron Man 2 is off to a great start with starting summer. The film is deeper in the story, the characters are as funny and charming as ever with the edition of some new characters, and action to keep you happy and satisfied through-out the entire film.In this film we see how Tony Stark is now a big celebrity and has helped bring what seems to be world peace. However, he has enemies on the move and are going to try and show the world that even Iron Man can bleed. So now with time running out and new mysteries about his own past to solve, Tony has a lot to do for this exciting follow-up to the 2008 blockbuster.The film has everything the average summer movie-goer wants to see in a film, great action, beautiful special effects, well-written script, and characters that you just have to love. Iron Man 2 in my opinion is better than the first and is probably one of the best superhero films ever made.",10,4,6,8 May 2010
The Hunger Games," May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor. And they certainly are!
","The odds are definitely in The Hunger Games favor in terms of box office and reception. I am a huge fan of the book and when I heard about the movie I just got excited as anyone could possibly get. Of course I still had some doubt. Every time I heard someone say it would be the 'next Twilight' my heart would drop because Twilight is by far not anywhere close to the standard set by The Hunger Games. However, I went into the movie with an open mind and was absolutely blown away.The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace that made me completely buy her as being Katniss and could not imagine anyone else as the strong heroine. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was. And Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow was absolutely terrifying in the role. He brought on the same aura of malice and hatred that the character was easily able to create in the books. This is just the first movie and I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table in future installments. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true. Everyone brought something great to the table but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie very high up. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome and done just right so that it didn't go overboard but was faithful enough to the book that the violence wasn't undermined. The outcome of having Suzanne Collins (author of The Hunger Games) work with director Gary Ross to write the script for the film version was probably one of the best things to happen for this film. It is superb filmmaking at it's finest.In closing, The Hunger Games is a faithful film adaptation to a great book that is superbly written, performed, and directed to create what will probably be one of the best films of the year. The action and suspense will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the film as well as surprise those of you who have read the books. This film is about two-and-a-half hours long but the pacing matches that of the book so that when it's over you'll feel like its only been an hour-and-a-half. It never drags on but is always on the move to something more exciting than the one before. This film will stay with you for years to come and will make you think a little more about what direction our society is going in.",10,4,15,25 March 2012
Beauty and the Beast," This film captures the true essence of what animation should be.
","From the time we could walk we would all hear about films such as The Little Mermaid or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and how they changed film-making forever. These films helped bring animation to life (Snow White being the first animated film and The Little Mermaid reviving the genre after it had almost died) while there are films which keep it alive. Beauty and the Beast is one of (if not) the best work of animation there has ever been.The story is about a girl named Belle who wants to have a better life than the ordinary one she got stuck with. In the beginning we learn of the prince who got turned into a beast for his heart was cold. And if he couldn't find anyone to love and love him in return before the rose he was given had wilted then him and all of the people who live in the castle (turned into house ware items) would remain the way they were forever. And that is where Belle comes in, as she goes in search for her father who went missing she finds herself at the Beast's castle and her father as well. In exchange for his freedom she would remain there and never leave again or see her loved ones again. So now a chain of events has been set into motion that will determine the fate of the Beast and all who inhabit his castle.Beauty and the Beast is obviously one of the most romantic, funny, charming, and enchanting films ever made. The characters are funny, loving, and beautifully made. The music is perfect along with the animation. Because of the animation we can see many charming characters do things that hasn't been done before in animation. The choreography moves everywhere and leaves us all just wanting more. This film is an instant classic filled with beautiful animation, great choreography, timeless music, and a love story to make your heart melt. Beauty and the Beast is one of the most enchanting films ever made, people will want to watch this over and over again.",10,5,6,13 May 2010
Brokeback Mountain," An Epic Love Story on the Same Level as Titanic
","Every generation has that defining forbidden love story. For Shakespeare's time it was 'Romeo and Juliet,' a story about two teenagers from different families but from the same world. 'Titanic' is from the 90's and is also about two young people falling in love except this time they're both from very different worlds. 'Brokeback Mountain' is the forbidden love story of our generation and this time both lovers are from the same world, sadly, that is the problem.The film focuses on two young cowboys in 1964, Ennis and Jack, who are working together for a summer herding sheep. During their time together they become close, so close they fall in love. Instead of living together they go their separate ways to live their own lives. They both get married, have children, and have decent jobs. However, they never forget each other and every chance they get, they get together on Brokeback Mountain to spend time together in anyway possible.I am one to openly state that I do not like western movies. I personally feel that the characters are unrelatable and stiff in western movies. And this is not just from watching one western, I have tried watching more than one an they all feel the same. However, I was completely engrossed in 'Brokeback Mountain.' This was a movie filled with fascinating characters and a story that made them as relatable as any real person. We have all been to a point in our lives where we fall for the person we know we can't have. The bad boy or the good girl, vice versa, and that is how they treat the characters in this film. Both of these men love each other wholeheartedly and there is a sense of melancholy surrounding their relationship because you know it will not end well for them. Watching them made me feel like I was watching 'Titanic' again and that I was looking at this generation's Jack and Rose.Of course, this would not have been possible if it was not for the fantastic performances of the leading cast. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal gave some of the best performances of their careers in this movie. Heath Ledger was heartbreaking as the obviously distant and maybe even hollow Ennis. A man who detached himself so much it was as if he was not even alive. That is until he was around Jack (played wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal), then he would light up with such a joy you would believe this man had never experienced joy like this before. And of course Jake Gyllenhaal also gave an equally powerful performance as Jack. A man who was willing to give up everything for Ennis, risk his life and future because he was madly in love with him. Yet, this also makes him equally as tragic. A man who cannot hide his feelings as well as Ennis and ends up trying to be himself while holding onto the life he has now. This movie would not have been what it was without these two amazing actors. Such fascinating characters.In fact, I was so utterly fixated on their characters I (even though tragic love stories have taught me differently) was hoping that they would find a way to be together in the end. That they would find the happy-ending they deserved. And that is why it works. If a tragic love story does not make you hope the best for the couple in question then it is not doing it's job. Even though I've watched 'Titanic' a hundred times, I root for Jack and Rose, I want them to find their happy ending because I am that invested in the main characters and their love story.I keep going back to 'Titanic' because I feel that 'Brokeback Mountain' is our generations 'Titanic.' We have ourselves one of the most beautifully told love stories in years that makes us root for them even though we know it will not end well. That is the beauty of this film. It makes us believe in true love while showing us that sometimes it isn't enough. Sometimes people need to change for love to live on.Also, I cannot forget the magnificent performances of the supporting cast. Michelle Williams gave a fantastic performance as the wife of Ennis. A woman who is definitely in love with Ennis but heartbroken by the truth of their relationship. The same can be said of Anne Hathaway and her riveting performance. She starts out as young woman in love with Jack but soon she realizes just how distant he really is from her. It is powerful to see her go from a young woman full of life to an older woman filled with bitterness. Both women are fascinating. And the filmmakers show us that it is not entirely anyone's fault when things fall apart. It's the fault of the fear of what's different, fear deep in a society.This is the type of movie that will open people's eyes to the truth about love: it is universal. It doesn't matter if the relationship is heterosexual or homosexual, love is the driving force in relationships. However, it is a reminder that society is the main force that can tear relationships apart. Whether it be because of social class, feuding families, or even whether it be of the same-sex. As a society, we must learn to accept love for what it is.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to find a great romantic film to watch. 'Brokeback Mountain' gives one of the most honest portrayals of a homosexual relationship to ever hit the screen. With such an honest view it made the issue all the more universal and relatable. On that note alone I commend the fantastic team behind this wonderful movie. With wonderful performances, sensitive direction, and a beautifully written script; 'Brokeback Mountain' soars to it's proper place among classics such as 'Titanic.' Bravo.",10,6,7,30 January 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best Marvel Movie Since 'The Avengers' and 'Iron Man'
","Considering we are now several movies, one mega-sequel to them all, and some direct sequels into Marvel Phase 2; needless to say there was a great amount of hype attached to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. So did it deserve the hype? Did it live up to the high bar set by movies such as 'The Avengers' and 'Iron Man'? The only thing I can think of is wow! This movie lived up to them both and then some.We find Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) two years after the battle of New York from 'The Avengers' and he is working with SHIELD now. While on a mission with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) he discovers that some things are not quite right deep in the ranks of SHIELD. On the run, he must uncover the conspiracy going on within SHIELD and deal with his greatest adversary yet; the Winter Soldier.While I enjoyed the first 'Captain America' I have to say this movie went above and beyond what I was expecting. Not only do we get a deeper look at one of the greatest superheroes of our time but we get a look at the ideals that have shaped our country into what it is now, and even leaves us pondering if what we are is something good or not. This message is loud and clear especially when Steve Rogers begins questioning everything he ever stood for. One line in particular stood out to me from the movie. In a conversation with Nick Fury, Rogers states 'We fought for freedom, this is fear' while discussing new weaponry being used by SHIELD, to which Fury replies 'We do things for the world we live in, not the one we dream of.' Most likely I messed up the wording in there somewhere but that is the gist of the conversation. This conversation really surprised me because it was showing that Marvel has no problem taking on deeper ideas when the time comes for it. I applaud them for it.However, the ideals being used would mean nothing if it wasn't for the fantastic performances by the leading cast. Scarlett Johansson reminded us why we love Black Widow. She brought the right amount of flair, depth, and even humor to a character that proves women can be just as tough (even tougher) than men. But Chris Evans is the heart and soul of the film. His portrayal of Steve Rogers really showcased why he is the best person to be the leading man in this series. He took on Rogers patriotism, heroism, fears, and even questioning with elegance in every stride. He made us love a character even more when we already did.This is without a doubt the best Marvel movie since 'The Avengers' and 'Iron Man'. Instead of a regular superhero movie, we got a 'Jason Bourne' type of espionage spy thriller with Captain America as the main character. Filled with intense, inspired action while also being a surprisingly intelligent film with fantastic performances; 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' soars above and beyond expectations with shocking twists that will be felt throughout the entire Marvel cinematic Universe. I am still in awe of it.",10,2,4,7 April 2014
Tangled," May I present the next addition to the Second Disney Renaissance Era.
","While some may not be familiar with the name 'Disney Renaissance', it was a sort of Disney Golden Age starting with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ending with Tarzan in 1999. The last ten years has mostly been nothing short of the type of animation you would find on Disney Channel or Toon Disney (now DisneyXD). Disney, for some strange reason, had lost it's creative ability but now these last few years has set the pace for Disney's redemption. Pixar is what has saved Disney's film industry but now thanks to the new Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter, who also worked closely on many Pixar movies, Disney is finding themselves making movies that in a few years time will rival Pixar. Now The Princess and the Frog began this new Renaissance Era and it seems to continue with Tangled.Now this is also a different rendition of the classic fairy-tale. In Tangled Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and hidden in this tower by an evil woman. Her hair actually has some kind of special power that makes her so coveted. Now Rapunzel is growing up and doesn't want to stay in the tower any more. When a thief hides in the tower she knocks him out and hides his prize. She makes him promise to take her out of the tower for a day and then she'll give him back what he wants. Of course something will happen between the two and there is always this climatic battle between good and evil. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. I found the characters real and charming. The songs were definitely catchy and I can still hear them in my head to this day.There has been much controversy over how the film was made. At first I was skeptical about leaving behind the use of animated drawing but the use of computer animation was maybe the better idea. They make the animation come to life and it pulls you into the movie and that's without the story or characters.Now as for the story that was, once again, another controversy proved to be a good idea. The filmmakers take the story to new heights and even asks questions only a Pixar film would dare to ask using animation. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider) are perfect as the leading characters. They bring humor as well as wit to roles in the most unexpected ways.Tangled isn't just another animated fairy-tale, it is a statement that Disney is back on there long-awaited top form. The title might be Tangled but Disney's return is as straight-forward as it gets. They've made their statement 'we're back and that is that.' And I can't wait to see what else they bring to the table.",10,9,11,12 October 2011
Shrek Forever After," Not better than the first two but a nice end to the series.
","Shrek one and two were some of the best animated films ever made. Filled with an all-star cast, great animation, and an original story with a well-written script perfect for its great cast. While the third one didn't live up to the expectations of the first two the fourth one is in ways an improvement.Shrek has always been visually stunning and the characters have always been loving so that isn't the issue. It is the script that could be a problem. While the third one showed a lot of promise it wasn't able to do much with it. However the fourth movie starts showing the promise in it and ends the film series on the right note.Here in Shrek Forever After Shrek is now a domesticated family man who seems to be living the dream. But things start changing when his seemingly perfect life becomes to predictable and boring for him. Now on his children's first birthday he loses it and wishes he was a regular ogre for just one day. Then Rumpelstiltskin comes and says that he can give Shrek what he wants and to get the day he has to give a day. In other words he has to give up a day in his life and what Shrek doesn't realize how it will change his life. Now he finds himself in an alternate reality where Rumpelstiltskin rules and the only thing he can do to change it is to get true loves kiss and break the contract.The story matches up to the better films of the Shrek franchise. It even has some good laughs and action as well. Mixed with 3D making this a fun installment in the Shrek film franchise. However it doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws. Maybe if the film was a little longer you could have more feel for Shrek when he goes to the alternate reality. It begins showing how miserable he is except it doesn't give us the time to get reacquainted with these great characters. Maybe that's its greatest flaw and that keeps us from truly enjoying the film like we enjoyed the first two films. While it did better than the third film it wasn't able to live up to first two. The 3D makes this film a treat to the eyes while the moments it has can keep you happy throughout the film making this a nice finale to the series about every ones favorite ogre.",8,2,8,23 May 2010
The Lego Movie," Funny, surprising, and absolutely charming.
","I think it's safe to say that most movies based off of toys never really end well. So that brings up the question: does 'The Lego Movie' fall into the same sad category such as the 'Transformers' series and 'Battleship' or does it break that problem that has plagued toy adaptations for years? The answer is, happily, the latter.'The Lego Movie' is about the journey of one tiny Lego figure named Emmet. In an ancient prophecy it was foreshadowed that a mighty hero would come and save the Lego Universe from a terrible villain who planned on gluing the entire universe together.Just like the toy that inspired it, this movie was brimming with imagination from top to bottom. From the Lego city that Emmet lives in to oceans of the Lego Universe this was imaginative all the way through. And honestly, that alone is worthy of praise. Many films now are mainly just recycled ideas without any true inspiration put into them. However, this was not the case with 'The Lego Movie'. Watching this movie you can tell the filmmakers had an absolute blast going into such an imaginative world. The possibilities were endless and that is really what made the difference.On top of imagination, this film is also filled with an intelligent (and even satirical) look at everyday life and a look at the role of the government (and our roles included). Just having a look at Emmet's life in the city you could tell this made fun of ordinary life, not in a mean way but an honest way. We wake up everyday and go throughout our daily lives greeting people, working at our jobs (whatever they may be), going home to relax for the next day alone or with people we care about, and getting up the next day. This sequence was exquisitely done, from the first scene of the President giving a vague, yet threatening, message to his people being undermined by the plain brainwashing of his people to the overall idea of being who we truly are. Wonderfully done.A lot of this is due to the excellent work by its A-list voice cast. Chris Pratt did wonderful work as Emmet, with him portraying the poor naivety of the Lego piece and his transition to someone willing to think for himself. The same can be said of Elizabeth Banks (hilarious as Wyldstyle), Will Ferrell as the villain, and Will Arnett (as Batman who ironically enough became the funniest character in the movie). Thanks to the great cast these characters will definitely be remembered for a very long time.So adults, I just want to remind you that this is a movie that you will enjoy, maybe even more than your children will. Not only is it a smart satirical look at government and everyday life but it also has a self-aware humor mixed with pop culture references that will have you rolling on the floor laughing. A prime example of this is Batman and the wonderful way they play to his cynicism. In the movies and comics we know Batman as the cynic he is but in such a colorful world there is just so much material to play off of it would've been a miscarriage of justice to ignore it. Well done Lego.In the end, this is a wonderful way to start off animation for 2014. Already at a stronger place than animation was this time last year, 'The Lego Movie' has definitely raised the bar where toy adaptations (and maybe even animated movies in general) are concerned. Wonderful storytelling mixed with great characters, beautiful visuals, plenty of humor to spare, and a great message about finding the hero in all of us; 'The Lego Movie' has proved that there is life for toy adaptations after all.",10,1,5,9 February 2014
Inside Out," Pixar Has Returned!
","For the past couples of years we have worried Pixar was losing it's luster. With the over-reliance of sequels it appeared Pixar was on a road to no longer producing gems but coal. However, 'Inside Out' proved Pixar's 'gem making business' is not over yet, not by a long shot.The movie deals with a girl named Riley and her move from her hometown in Minnesota to San Francisco. However, the story is mainly told from the perspectives of her five emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness. They all work together to keep Riley normal and work even harder to do this once she moves. However, as is expected, something even worse happens leading to a huge adventure throughout Riley's mind.Pixar has not just created another enticing adventure for us but also an engrossing coming-of-age story. Yes, it is brightly colored and filled with hijinks of epic proportions but in the end this is actually a very intimate story of a girl leaving childhood. We all remember those days when we realized our childhoods were ending, and those days were incredibly difficult.As we grow older we find things changes, some small and others big. And the simple truth is change is scary. In fact, it can be pretty terrifying, and that is what Riley deals with in this movie. This is not some story of a girl being spoiled and throwing a temper tantrum, this is the story of a girl finding everything she ever believed in disappearing.Watching this happen from inside her head makes the adventure all the more thrilling. Throughout the movie we watch as both Joy and Sadness work together to get back to Riley and save her from whatever catastrophe that lies ahead. To do this they find themselves in some very amazing locations such as Imagination Land and (a very inspired setting) Dream Productions.These locations add even more layers to the story being told here. Slowly we watch as Riley goes from a happy girl to a child falling into depression. It is very dark, serious subject matter for a kids movie to deal with. In fact, if it was any other studio I doubt they would've had a chance to tell this story correctly.Thankfully Pixar had this story and they knocked it out of the park. They tell the very simple, yet important, truth that it is important to feel all of our emotions. We watch as Riley numbs herself from the pain of what's happened and that takes her to places she would not have gone otherwise. It makes very complex notions easy enough for children to understand while still maintaining the complexity. A remarkable feat for any movie to do.Of course the movie would not be half as enjoyable if it was not for the wonderful voice cast. Amy Poehler was born to play Joy. It would be very easy to make Joy incredibly annoying because of her perky attitude. However, Poehler finds the right balance to make her very charming. The entire cast was also fantastic. Phyllis Smith was perfect as the downer of the group, Sadness. Of course I cannot forget Mindy Kaling (Disgust), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger), or Richard Kind (Bing Bong) who were all so wonderful.'Inside Out' was the return to form everyone has been waiting for. Pixar has always been known for greatness so when they have a story that jumps out even more so than usual, people tend to take notice. This is no doubt one of Pixar's very best features and it will go down as an instant classic. With a wonderful message about feeling our emotions instead of numbing them, 'Inside Out' goes beyond expectations to create an incredibly mature movie going experience for everyone. Yes, the movie deals with these five emotions, but upon leaving the main ones movie goers will feel will be joy and a little bit of sadness.",10,18,56,13 September 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," 'The Empire Strikes Back' for the 'Dragon' Trilogy!
","In a squeaky voice I hear Hiccup screaming to the top of his lungs 'ARE YOU READY BUD?' and I end up replying in a soft whisper, 'Not sure yet.' The shivers of anticipation and fear trembled throughout my body. The fact is the first 'How to Train Your Dragon' was so amazing (then again, that is opinion but mine stands) how can it possibly be topped?! Well I found the answer to that question and to Hiccup's question after walking out of the theater. Boy I wasn't ready for it but 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' brought it big time. Needless to say, I was in awe with how fantastic this movie was.We begin five years after the first movie ended. Hiccup and his friends are living the good life with dragons for pets being the new norm. However, this new paradise seems to disappear with the emergence of a vicious enemy who aims to create a dragon army for the sole-purpose of world domination. Then of course comes along a mysterious dragon rider causing all types of trouble (if you've seen the previews then this will not be a shock but I shall be kind just in case you have not). Hiccup ends up working with Toothless once again to bring down this enemy and in the process change everything they've ever known.The way this film builds upon it's predecessor is by simply doing the one thing most sequels do not like doing; continuing the story in such a way that it could stand on its own as a stand-alone film. This film is not the first film, in fact it dives even deeper into the story and world the first film brought us.A sequel, a great sequel knows how to broaden the story and mature it as it goes along. And that is exactly what they do here. We find Hiccup realizing that maybe he has been naive with certain ideals he carries, he realizes maybe it is time to grow up. Now-a-days coming of age stories are almost ubiquitous, but 'Dragon 2' knows how to make it feel fresh. In the first one Hiccup was trying to find himself, he is still doing that here but it is more from a desire to find his place in a grown up world than to be accepted for who he is. The transition between the Hiccup we met in the first movie to the Hiccup of this movie is very well done and completely believable.And just as Hiccup has grown, the story grows with him by becoming darker and more mature with it's themes. Here we deal with a new form of family discord not really seen in animated films. We find teen romance on the bloom. And the idea of diplomacy over war. This film deals with such complex issues that it can be easy to forget this is a kids film about dragons.Which leads me to comment on the visuals of the movie. The animation is absolutely breathtaking. From the very first scene showcasing the dragons on Berk to the final epic fight sequence. This is a film of the highest caliber in regard to how animation should look. The clouds mixing with the red and orange of a setting sun, the mountains that touch the sky, and even the giant ice fortress that looks like something from a far away dream. This movie is huge on spectacle but it never forgets the heart of the story.The characters are just as endearing as they were when we first met them. Some of them have grown up some considering the time-span but this is to be expected. Jay Baruchel is, as always, fantastic as Hiccup. This time he brings a maturity to the role while keeping him goofy and good-natured. The same can be said for the rest of the all-star voice cast. Gerard Butler, America Ferrara, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, and even new cast member such as Kit Harington (Game of Thrones) are all fantastic.Amazingly, they manage to keep all of these different factors under control when it could have so easily gone wrong. Once again this films backbone (just like the first) is the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. This simple, yet vital, relationship could've been lost in the franticness of the plot and the wide range of characters. However, Director and Writer Dean DeBlois nimbly moves around these issues as if there was no problem at all. It is expert filmmaking to the highest degree.'How to Train Your Dragon 2' put my fears to rest by giving us a story that is darker and more mature than the first. They expanded on the world from the first movie and gave us even more wonderful character moments. Filled with great, sly humor and breathtaking visuals. This movie is filled with spectacle but it never forgets the quiet, tear-jerking moments that made the first movie such a hit. Since both movies are so great there is room to debate for either one. Both have valid points for being better than the other but I would have to say 'Dragon 2' is better than the first (as hard as it is to believe). This is 'The Empire Strikes Back' for the 'Dragon' Trilogy and even (as of right now) the best animated movie of the year. Kids and adults will both be walking away saying one thing 'Can we go see it again?' and I'm sure you will.",10,5,12,21 June 2014
Insidious," We have just witnessed that horror isn't dead.
","Now I think everyone can agree that the last decade of horror movies has just been one remake and gross-out after another. Nothing has lived up to the expectations of the originals as well as nothing original has come out. It's usually something we've always seen before, however it really isn't the fault of the use of dilapidated old houses or mansions every now and then. It's more from the clichÃ©s and no feelings for any characters because the filmmakers have been mostly trying to gross us out instead of trying to make time to create people we care about as well as to do what horror movies should do, and that is to scare us. Yet it was in 2007 when Paranormal Activity came out I caught a glimpse of the future of horror. It replaces Saw as the Halloween movie to see and now we are at last getting something good from these places called 'film studios.' Drag Me to Hell definitely kept things going in the right direction in 2009 and now we have Insidious. Horror movies are finally (as well as unbelievably) getting better. And Insidious is just another reason why we shouldn't give up horror movies.The story is pretty straight-forward. A family moves into this old house then strange things start happening as well as their son falling into coma. Of course you would think the haunting has something to do with it but you never know with these movies sometimes. At first it looks like the same old kind of horror story you find from the Masters of Horror series but it progresses from that into a full blown horror movie that made me jump, squirm, and even almost scream. Even though I didn't scream I still said 'Oh my God!' maybe a hundred times. This definitely went beyond my expectations.But it's hard to find the perfect movie for its genre and there are a few minor problems. One being that the strength of the film kinda lightens up in the last act but still maintains some of the eeriness of the rest of it. My last complaint is that when the last act starts coming to an end you can pretty much guess how it's going to end. Now with any other movie these would be the problems that could possibly destroy it. And actually those rules don't apply to Insidious. The film is held up by its eerie atmosphere that grabs you from the very beginning and the talented actors to relate to you by being normal people.The film is actually a collaboration from the creator of Paranormal Activity and the creators of Saw, you would think that such a collaboration would be disastrous but it actually was probably one of the smartest collaborations since Wes Craven worked with Kevin Williamson on the Scream movies (first two and the fourth). There is no gore (which surprised me considering the Saw creators were in on it) or even any blood at all. The movie does what scary movies should do and that is to scare and not gross-out. So while there are some problems, Insidious is probably one of the scariest movies of the year and helps create something original out of the so frequently used ghost stories with haunted, old houses. And that's what is so good about Insidious. It shows that most of the time it's not the setting or the story that makes horror movies bad, it can be the filmmakers and no inspiration put into it. So I just hope that this can be a model for other horror movies and show that there is originality in what was once an almost dead genre.",9,2,3,10 October 2011
Frozen," Charming Addition to the Disney Movie Canon
","The questions have been far and wide concerning the highly anticipated 'Frozen.' Is it just an icy version of 'Tangled?' Does it live up to the hype? Is it the best movie since 'The Lion King?' Well the answers are in order as so: no, yes, and debatable.'Frozen' is the story of a young princess named Anna. She has spent most her days in the seclusion of her castle for the sole purpose of keeping her safe from the terrifying secret of her sister, Elsa. Elsa has the power to create snow out of nothing. Once her secret comes out there is no stopping her power. So when Elsa runs away Anna goes off to find her along with some new allies. All in the hope of making things right again.This is a completely different story from 'Tangled' and it proves this with some very nice twists in the whole fairy-tale scheme of things. And it also does a great job of living up to the incredible amount of hype set for the movie (fantastic songs, great voice-cast, beautiful animation, and great writing). However, the statement that it is the 'best movie since 'The Lion King'' is a very bold one at that. 'The Lion King' is a classic film that very few films in general can match in caliber. Though I will say 'Frozen' is a classic in it's own right.The songs for the movie have a deep sense of nostalgia, going all the way back to the Disney Renaissance Era. There were several numbers where I felt transported back to classic musical numbers such as show-stopping numbers like 'Be Our Guest' and triumphant, powerful songs like 'Circle of Life.' While watching this movie you will definitely feel the intent for this movie to become a Broadway musical. For those who live in New York, be on the look out because this should be one great time at the theatre.Of course the movie would have fallen flat if was not for the wonderful talent of the leading cast (pretty much the entire cast are Broadway vets, hint anybody?). The wonderful innocence, naivety of Anna was portrayed so well by Kristen Bell. When she spoke there was a sweet charm about her and her singing felt more angelic, light. This was a great contrast with the powerful, belting vocals of Idina Menzel as Elsa. Her role as the conflicted queen was perfect for her (also her background with roles like this in 'Wicked' made her the perfect choice). She brought a certain maturity to conflict Anna's innocence while giving us show-stopping numbers ('Let It Go' was probably one of the best songs of the year). Their chemistry was great.The rest of the supporting cast did fantastic jobs as well. Jonathan Groff was great as Kristoff (still angry they didn't let him sing much at all). So was Santino Fontana as Hans, but it was Josh Gad as Olaf out of these three who had the best scene-stealing moments. Even though I loved seeing Anna and Kristoff banter back and forth, I felt myself smile even wider whenever Olaf was on screen. He was charming, funny, and just too adorable to ignore. Though I couldn't help but feel bad for laughing while he sang 'In Summer,' a song about how he'd be doing what a snowman does during summer (dark humor in a Disney movie, love it).All-in-all, this was a great addition to the Disney movie canon. We got ourselves some original and fantastic songs, tons of memorable characters, a wonderfully written script, and some nice (much-needed) twists on the fairy-tale ideas. Even though it is hard to match up to 'The Lion King' this is still a great Disney movie that the whole family will enjoy and I will not be surprised if it wins the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.",10,6,16,6 December 2013
Stardust," Fun, exciting, funny, and just an amazing adventure!!!
","Stardust is the movie fantasy fans have waited for. It is a truly amazing spectacle of special effects, story, great acting and more. It is like the ultimate chase in the fantasy world. When I first heard how in the movie villains would be constantly after this woman who is actually a falling star to where once you eat her heart you can become young again. I thought it wouldn't be so good. But after I saw it I just can't stop thinking about it. It is something I would watch over and over again. It has an all star cast making it great, Michelle Pfeiffer plays the villain amazingly then Robert De Niro is hilarious in his role as a gay pirate. Watch this movie if you want something truly amazing to place your eyes on. If you want to see a movie full of thrills, fantasy, comedy, and an amazing adventure then see Stardust.",10,1,2,22 October 2009
Clash of the Titans," Nice story and special effects, just doesn't have the character's developed enough.
","While 'Clash of the Titans' has a good story with a nice setting and special effects the characters just don't give any reason to like them. The movie is around two hours long and even if it took another hour just to actually get to a point where its fun watching the characters (and like them) then my seven dollars would have actually been worth it.'Clash of the Titans' is the story about the son of the Greek god Zeus and his battle to try and make peace between the mortals and the gods. When the gods have become mistreating of the mortals they begin to rebel. It is the prayers of the mortals that give the gods strength so with no where else to go Zeus turns to his brother Hades for help. Zeus tells Hades to unleash the Krakken a powerful creature created by Hades himself onto the humans in ten days if a sacrifice is not made to please the gods. However Hades has his own plans, which involve taking over Olympus. So its up Zeus' son and others to try and stop them before its to late.While the action sequences are enjoyable you can't feel the suspense of the fight because the characters just aren't that likable. I have seen some of these actors in other films and they are a lot better than they are in this movie. The roles could be good for them, but the way the script was written it was like the film-makers didn't want there to be any emotion at all. The characters are just plainly boring and not likable at all, end of story. Another thing is mostly action and not enough of the story (while it is nice the story can't truly be seen through all of the action).If I could I would give one star for a good story and nice setting, two stars for beautiful special effects and great action, and two and a half stars for characters being boring and not likable.",6,1,2,14 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," A crazy delight from the master of inventive and creative film-making.
","Alice in Wonderland is one of those movies which shows Tim Burton still has what it takes to survive the world of cinema filled with huge special effects and action in almost every movie. It has the usual dark tone which is seen in just about every movie Tim Burton makes while also being a fun and creative kind of crazy (even for Alice in Wonderland).I guess you could say it was kind of a sequel to the story of Alice in Wonderland we've all heard. It's been 13 years since Alice has been in Wonderland, she is now 19 and thinks that Wonderland was a nightmare she had as a little girl. Like her father she is a thinker of things that seem impossible. Alice is being told what to do by everyone to where it seems that her voice has no matter in her own life. After being proposed to by a man she has no feelings for she once again falls down the rabbit hole. When in Wonderland she learns that there are many things she has to do to try and stop the Red Queen's reign of terror once and for all. She meets up with some of her old friends along with new on this amazing new concept for the classic story.Burton has done it again with Alice in Wonderland. There many very talented actors playing roles that are almost perfect for them. Even though I haven't seen it in 3D I already know that it would be a lot of fun to see it that way from what I saw from the 2D version. This is one of those Tim Burton movies that you would just love to see over and over again with the fun characters, amazing special effects and great battle sequences, Burton has done it once again.",9,14,23,15 March 2010
Avatar," Splendid!!! A remarkable achievement in the world of cinema!!!
","Avatar makes the best out of CGI in this live-action, emotional, putting you on the edge of your seat film of extraordinary proportions.Just like James Cameron has done in the past he has brought something new to cinema. He has directed some of the most influential and amazing films of the last twenty years some examples being The Terminator and Titanic. Avatar has now come to take it's place in such high rankings.Watching Avatar is like being on a roller-coaster ride that you just do not want to get off of. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking about. With all of the action, sorrow, romance, and the fight to just be there is absolutely no way that you can't enjoy this movie.Avatar tells the story about a man named Jake that lost his legs while on duty in the military. Now he travels to the world Pandora on a mission that could help him get his legs back. He is on a mining world where what they are digging up is worth a lot of money. However, the natives of Pandora are called the Na'vi and their home is on the site of where they're trying to mine and that is where Jake comes in. His mission was to get them to relocate but in time that starts to change. He uses an avatar (a body that looks like him and Na'vi as well) he uses this body to communicate with the Navi. While he is under their care he falls for the princess of the Na'vi. As he feels more at home with them the sooner he realizes that he must make a choice to side with the humans or the Na'vi and find his true place in life.Avatar is probably the most amazing film of not just the year but the decade. This is a film that you would love to see over and over again.",10,40,66,2 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Amazing!!!!! The best horror movie I've seen in years!!!!!!
","Drag me to Hell is the most clever, fun, and scary horror movie to come out in years. It is smarter than the cult classic Scream, more fun than Final Destination, and scarier than The Grudge.Before Drag me to Hell came out I had lost all faith in all future horror movies. I was beginning to think that there would never be anymore good horror movies but Drag me to Hell has re-newed my faith.If you are a horror movie fan and you feel the same way I felt well then see Drag me to Hell. Its like a ride that never stops. Also scares come out at every scene making this the perfect Halloween movie.A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th have nothing on this movie. Some of the worlds best ghost movies can't compare to this. I can not wait for Sam Raimi to make another horror movie. Scary, original, great acting, and just plain fun to see makes this a great horror movie.",10,7,14,14 October 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Surprised me on every level of film-making!!!
","'How to Train Your Dragon' is a surprisingly great film. It has emotional story-telling, a great cast, beautiful animation and a story which can excite any movie-goer.When I first heard of 'How to Train Your Dragon' I think we all had the same thought, another cheesy dragon film that is just another excuse to make a movie about dragons. Now lets be honest some the more recent dragon films haven't been what any one would call 'good'. However this movie isn't like the others. It's kinda like a talent show you always save the best for last and I'm guessing that's what the film-makers did. I was strangely moved by this film which truth be told no film has ever moved me like this one before. When I took my nephew to see it I had no idea I would be walking out from a truly beautiful film.In summary the story is about a boy named Hiccup who wants to be a dragon killer like his father and the Vikings in his village, however he isn't really the fighting type in the eyes of his people. So now he wants to prove himself to his father and his people by killing the most powerful dragon to ever cause trouble for his people. When he succeeds in capturing it he couldn't kill it. So he learns from it and other dragons that all is not what it appears to be. The only problem is convincing his people of that and learning what mysterious threat is causing the dragons to act the way they are and hopefully start a new and better age for the dragons and his people.This film dives into the commonly used element of father and son, we all see how he wants his father to see him as a Viking and someone great and the way it comes out is surprisingly heart-touching. It doesn't matter whether its in 3D or not. I haven't seen it in 3D and I don't care about it because I enjoyed this film a great deal without it. So no matter what you see it in you will enjoy this movie. Thanks to moving story-telling, a great performance by the actors, and beautiful animation fire has been breathed into the once almost dead dragon movie genre.",10,2,4,6 April 2010
Titanic," One of the most beautiful films ever made.
","When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven't seen the movie yet you will) you'll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.Just about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn't really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I'm one of those people. For those of you that haven't seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.This is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn't love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.This is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990's. A must-see for all movie goers.",10,3,5,24 January 2010
WALL·E," Goes beyond the confines of space and beyond the confines of any ordinary animated film.
","Wall-e is purely innocent fun that anyone will just love. This is a movie that can stimulate a child's imagination while getting through to the young at heart.In Wall-e we meet a robot whose job is to clean up trash. It's several hundred years into the future and Earth is void of all human life. As the world became more devastating by pollution, what remained of human-kind left Earth on an intergalactic cruise ship. For hundreds of years Wall-e has been cleaning up waiting for the day that his curious mind can be settled. He watches old videos and musicals which gets him to think about something more, love. Then a probe named Eve comes down from the ship looking for something and then they both meet. As Wall-e shows Eve how fun it is to be a free spirit she leaves. As Wall-e follows her into space they both go on an adventure that could change the fate of mankind forever.Seeing this movie is almost like seeing a modern day silent film. The main characters in the movie don't talk (except for the noises they make) which makes the movie even more fun to watch. The Wall-e character is so funny and adorable you just can't help yourself but to say ah from how cute he is. Even when he's getting hit by something you just can't help but to laugh and say ah while feeling bad for him because he's such a lovable character. This is the movie families, children, adults, even teenagers can love without feeling any kind of regret.",10,0,1,7 February 2010
The Conjuring," Reminds you that a creaky door can still be scary.
","It has been a long time since a truly terrifying film has come out. While I do think 'Insidious' is a nice scary treat for haunted house stories, 'The Conjuring' blew me away.'The Conjuring' is based on the true story (then again, Hollywood would say a movie about talking toys is based on a true story if it sold more tickets) of a family haunted by some unknown entity in the new home they got. The film is based off an old case-file investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life married couple who investigated the Amityville Horror. However, unlike other films based off their exploits, we get a film where they're actually main characters. So now it is up to the Warrens to help save the day for this family of seven.Something else that is very surprising about this film is that it actually makes you CARE about the characters. Most of the time in horror movies you have to deal some dumb kids having sex before Jason Myers or Michael Voorhees comes along and puts an end to our misery. However, that isn't the case with 'The Conjuring.' Vera Farmiga gives a fantastic performance as Lorraine Warren, a woman who won't let anything get in the way of protecting her family or doing what is right. Patrick Wilson also gives a great performance as Ed Warren, a man who would do anything to protect his wife. Lili Taylor also gives a fantastic performance as a mother trying to protect her family. Basically what I'm trying to say is this is a horror movie with great acting! I know, I was shocked too.Now James Wan has truly grown since his days directing 'Saw.' There is little to no gore in this movie, just pure terror. Wan makes you care about the characters before beginning the truly scary stuff. After all, Wan is under the insane notion that things could be scarier if we actually care about what happens to the people in this movie. I wonder where he got that idea? No matter how much you prepare yourself, however, you will never be ready for the mounting dread that will haunt you from the beginning of the film. From the very first shot to the last moment you will be on the edge of your seat wanting to yell at the screen 'Hurry up I can't take the tension anymore!' But you will take the tension because that is what this movie does. It builds the tension to the absolute highest and scares you to the point of screaming way out loud. There may be a couple jump scares here and there but the true money is when James Wan decides to show you what real fear is. Sure it might not bring anything new to the genre but it does remind you why classic horror is always the way to go. Wan proves that not all the blood in the world can outmatch a good olé fashioned creaky door in the middle of the night.In the end, 'The Conjuring' is an extremely well done film with a great cast, fantastic direction, and clever script. You will be jumping out of your seat one scene after another. Just pray that the creaky door at night is just because it needs to be oiled.",10,1,3,23 July 2013
Toy Story 3," Enchanting, loving, and emotional. Toy Story 3 lives up to high expectations and more.
","I've been watching Toy Story as long as I can remember and now its hard to imagine this great trilogy come to an end. Toy Story 3 delivers beyond what we were expecting. It has great comedy, wonderful performances by its all-star cast, probably one of the most emotional stories made by Pixar, and a climax so suspenseful it makes the ending all the more emotional.Toy Story comes from an older generation of films. By now everyone who saw the films when they were younger is grown or just about grown. But it doesn't stop Pixar. Toy Story was one of the first animated films I had ever seen. Then Toy Story 2 came out and that film helped keep me fixated on Toy Story for a long time. Now I'm older, but it doesn't stop me from loving Toy Story and its great sequels. In a way I think its the filmmakers saying goodbye to the older generation of kids who first saw Toy Story and the other great Pixar films and welcoming a new generation. However you look at it there is still an obvious message in the film. And the message is simple but like all Pixar movie messages are they are also smart (especially the way its executed), but I think I'll let you find out what it is on your own.The film is about Andy leaving for college and now the toys are worried about their future. Then one thing leads to another and they end up at Sunnyside (a daycare) where they meet some new toys like the leader Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear and at first they think its great until they learn that they were put in the toddlers playroom. After being tortured by the kids they learn Andy is looking for them so they decide to break out of there. However they learn that Lotso isn't as nice as he seems. So now with time running short before Andy leaves they have to break out and learn what it truly means to be a toy.I found this film to being darker than the previous Toy Story films. In the first film Woody and Buzz are afraid of being alone on the side of the road or being trapped in an evil kids house. In the second one Woody's afraid of being sent to Japan. But in this film the toys are afraid that they're going to die. And the darker element I have to say is great. It helps build for a more suspenseful climax and shows that Lotso is probably one of the most evil and insane villains created by Pixar. Especially since at first he seems nice and lovable but when he shows how cruel he is you know the toys are in trouble. And the darker element got me thinking about Up and Wall-e. Both of those movies were Pixar's move out of their comfort zone. Wall-e being a post-apocalyptic film with a message about the future of the world if people don't change and Up taking on serious elements like marriage, life, death, and learning to let go. And now Toy Story 3 does something different as well, it has a much darker tone for a Pixar film which really works. There might be a couple scenes where younger kids might be scared but nothing that should terrify them beyond the point of seeing this film.And a little warning, this film is a tearjerker. The end practically had me tearing up and a couple times I felt a tear run down my cheek and I could see it in the faces of the rest of the audience as well. The film is meant to be bitter sweet. Because of that tears are pretty much guaranteed.This film brings back some of the most beloved characters in film-making history and even brings back its audience from more than a decade ago. There are so many memories in the Toy Story films anyone who loved them when they were a kid can't help but see this film and shed a few tears for their old childhood friends. And who can blame them (including me) for doing so, Pixar has proved time and time again that animated films are for more than just children and that the emotional aspects of the films can even be better than some of the best live action dramas that have ensured tears from their audience.My love for animation has proved to live on again in the new Toy Story film. Ladies and gentlemen what we have here is sure to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Film this year. I thought it wasn't possible but my high expectations were met when I saw Toy Story 3. It has beautiful animation, loving characters, a great and emotional story, and a finale fit for the toys who have enchanted our lives for more than a decade. Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story from the trilogy and is yet another Pixar masterpiece.",10,8,11,22 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'A New Hope' for a New Generation
","Ten years ago we never even dared to dream of finding another 'Star Wars' movie hitting theaters after 'Revenge of the Sith' ended. In fact, many probably hoped/prayed there would never be another opportunity to ruin 'Star Wars' again. Then Disney bought Lucasfilm and a new age dawned.Needless to say the anticipation (as well as anxiety) has been high. For the first time since 1983, there is an actual SEQUEL to the original 'Star Wars' trilogy. However, the prequel trilogy left quite the bad taste in people's mouths. This meant it was top priority for Disney to make this movie one of the best they possibly could. Now if they just wanted to make money off of this then making a bad movie wouldn't have mattered much. This movie was gonna make money either way. But it is very clear they wanted this movie to kick-start a new franchise that will live on throughout the ages.I will refrain from giving any of the plot away because that could detract from the experience of it. Going into this movie completely blind to what you'll find is one of it's many joys. I will say this movie gives us what 'Star Wars' fans have been craving: a 'Star Wars' movie with the joy, thrills, emotion, and (arguably the most important aspect) fun of the original trilogy.I will speak very briefly (by briefly I mean a lot) on the huge mount of talent on screen: the entire cast is fantastic. There is not a single weak-link among this wonderful ensemble. The original cast bring a sense of nostalgia with them while the new cast represents the torch being passed down to them. Daisy Ridley is one of these new actors and she is perfect for the role of Rey. As soon as you meet Rey you can tell she is going to be a hero worth rooting for. She is the new Luke for this generation (young person longing for a life of amazement). Throughout the entire movie she gives you reasons of why you should love this character. A great new addition to the cast.Of course John Boyega is also fantastic as Finn. His charm and humor makes him someone easy to cheer on as well. He is truly a great persona to have on-board. Of course there is Oscar Isaac, Gwendoline Christie, Domnhall Gleeson, and Andy Serkis in great yet limited roles. Their characters are so interesting I cannot wait to learn more about them down the road.However, out of the new villains introduced, Adam Driver steals the show as Kylo Ren. This villain is almost the exact opposite of Darth Vader in every way. In fact, as a character, you could say he's even stronger than Vader ever was. Driver is able to give Ren a sense of tragedy and pain that never shined through in Vader (mainly because Vader was always meant to be imposing to the very end). Even though Ren does terrible things, you cannot help but feel sympathy for him. However, he is still incredibly imposing, not as imposing as Andy Serkis' Supreme Leader Snoke though. You can tell this being is the big bad of the series now and he is a terrifying figure. Another intriguing character I cannot wait to learn more about.However, if any character was the heart and soul of this movie it would have to be Han Solo. Harrison Ford is back and I cannot tell you how wonderful it was seeing him back in this iconic role. He brings a sense of weariness and scruffy charm Han never had before. He is the biggest tie to the original trilogy and it is wonderful seeing him again.The action is also very impressive. JJ Abrams use of practical and CGI effects blends beautifully to create an intense and wonderful feeling throughout the movie. It feels like classic 'Star Wars.' Overall, this is the movie we have been waiting for. Filled to the brim with intense action, emotion, humor, and heart. Also populated with fantastic characters both old and new (with great actors in these roles). 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' reminds us (while showing new viewers) why this series is so beloved while giving us greater hope for the future.",10,5,27,18 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Best Movie of the Summer and one of the Years Best! Fitting End to such a Grand Story!
","Ten years ago Harry Potter began and now, ten years later, it ends with a beauty and majesty that is unmatched by any other film in the series. Here is where everyone went all out, both in performance as well as artistic wise. Our beloved three main actors; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, put on on the performances of their careers in this final Harry Potter. They unleash an emotional side of themselves that we haven't seen before in their movies while also showing the strength of their characters unlike we've ever seen in any other Harry Potter. However, alas, it is still nearly impossible for any actor in the movie to stand by the imposing figure of the scared and angry Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) as well as the intimidating and secretive Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); who also has an almost Darth Vaderish feel about him in this movie, and not be out-shined. Either way, besides the outstanding performances, the special effects team worked the most amazing kind of magic for the climatic final battle of Hogwarts. The posters show that Hogwarts is in ruin but seeing how it got there just sets an almost tearful mood for decade long fans (and even non-fans shall be tempted to shed a tear for the painful sight). The technical aspects of the film will blow anyone as much as the performances will. Altogether it will cause your eyes to blaze with the power from this film.In this final Harry Potter film the secret of the 'Deathly Hallows' will finally be revealed as well as what secret Dumbledore had kept from Harry all these years. The great battle for Hogwarts will begin and Harry most face his toughest challenge of all. It all comes together and of course we all know that it could've ended either good or bad but, happily, it was not the latter. The story takes a hold of you and will keep you firmly grasped until the very last powerful scene of the film. It's ending is a fitting end to one of the greatest film franchises in history, bringing about emotional power that will finally make the restraining tears burst through.In this film you will laugh, cry, and even applaud as the final reel ends. As Harry Potter comes to a much anticipated close the feeling will be bitter-sweet, after all, it's not easy seeing everyone's favorite wizard leave the big screen for the last time. But, the wonderful cast and crew who worked tirelessly on this decade long project will definitely have a bright future in Hollywood. Me, personally, cannot wait to see what else they do and 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2' has my vote for Best Picture of the Year at the Golden Globe Awards.",10,0,0,11 September 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A worthy middle chapter in a surprisingly mature teen franchise.
","It is has been over a year now since the first 'The Hunger Games' took the box office (and audiences) by storm. Now after much anticipation, well marketed hype, and a year of below par sequels (mostly); 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is finally here. So is the verdict. And the verdict is very glowing indeed.'Catching Fire' is all about the consequences of Katniss' victory in the last Hunger Games. She tricked the Capitol and President Snow wants revenge. So while she tries to appease President Snow she must also deal with the fact that she is the reluctant symbol of a rebellion beginning to emerge in the Districts. Things get even worse for her as she must decide how she will keep her loved ones safe as the next Hunger Games come closer, and these Games will have a twist that will change things forever.The sequel does a fantastic job of diving deeper into the thought-provoking ideas of the books. We find deeper themes concerning totalitarian government, the one percent versus the ninety-nine percent, violence in our media, and beginnings of war. It is based off of a young adult novel but it is much smarter than your average teen story.All of this is mainly due to the wonderful new direction the film was taken into by Francis Lawrence (new director). While I did enjoy the controversial shaky-camera of 'The Hunger Games' I will admit there is something refreshing to get a clear look at the action this time around. However, Lawrence was smart because he kept the dark tone set by Gary Ross in the original and he even expanded upon it. Usually there is fear of a change in directors so suddenly can lead to jarring tonal shifts with films in a series. However, Lawrence did an excellent job of making the film his own while building off of the world we had seen in the first movie.While Lawrence did add something new and exciting to the series, the fact is 'Catching Fire' would fail if it was not for the fantastic actress that was placed in the lead. At this point it is cliché to say that Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic but it is very true. From the very first shot of the film she has you trapped in her gaze. Her down-to-earth persona makes Katniss very relatable. Also, Jennifer made the smart move to show the thing in Katniss that makes her relatable to almost everybody, the desire to protect her family and loved ones. They could not have found a better actress to portray the endearment, strength, love, and vulnerability that is Katniss Everdeen.Of course the rest of the cast do fantastic jobs as well. Josh Hutcherson portrays Peeta's broken heart with finesse as well as the strength (and even pain) he has gained from being in the Hunger Games before. Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time around and he does a great job with it. We know Gale loves Katniss (but also confused on how to deal with this situation) and this time that is explored more in depth which is a nice focus. Then of course there is Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravits, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, and new cast members; Jena Malone, Sam Claflin, and Philip Seymour Hoffman who all do fantastic jobs. It is hard to find such a reliable cast in a brand new movie series.One final note concerns the love story in the film. While the love story is not the primary focus of the series I am happy to see it get more time to expand in this movie. The chemistry between Lawrence/Hutcherson and Lawrence/Hemsworth is clearly much more distinguishable in this movie. We see a teenage girl who is in the middle of a revolution while dealing with normal teenage girl problems in her home. And I am happy that the filmmakers were careful in their portrayal of the love story and did not make it feel forced or cheesy. The chemistry and the story itself did all the work.All-in-all, this is a very fine addition to what is probably one of the smartest franchises to come out in a long time. With fantastic performances, great direction and writing, intense action sequences, and a deeper sense of the thought-provoking themes from the novel; 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' soars above and beyond expectations to set the stage for the two-part final act to come.",10,3,25,22 November 2013
