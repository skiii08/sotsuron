First Man," More of a drama than a heroic/technical movie
","The setting and characterization of the movie are great, although the profundity and splendor of the idea of the First Man steping on the moon were marginally presented.",9,2,7,13 October 2018
Gone Girl," Perfectly plotted with a tiny loophole
","I loved the plot development and the characterization. It made me have mixed feelings for the characters all the time, and I hardcore enjoyed it.
However, taping Amy as she confesses to the crime she committed might not be a tall order for Nick, if he really wants to put an end to a marriage life with a murderous psychopath. I think having a baby doesn't necessarily justify his staying.",9,1,1,2 December 2019
Room," Amazing Plot with a little downside
","I enjoyed watching this movie characterizing a horrific real-world problem. I could literally imagine living like them and realizing how I'd feel like being suffocated in this situation. However, characterizing a little struggle or escape plan in the past 7 years from 'Ma' would exhibit a better sense of hope and want of freedom.",8,0,1,2 December 2019
