National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Nonsense production for an audience without expectations.
","I had seen the previous National Treasure, and armed with that memory and the knowledge that this was a Disney movie, I watched its sequel without a great deal of expectations---predictable adventure drivel, Indiana Jones with more modern special effects, is what I expected. But this movie manages to disappoint even fairly modest expectations such as those.In the end it really comes down to two problems: (1) It doesn't make any sense. (2) The acting is awful.On (1), I really don't mean to nitpick on historical minutiae---hell, I'd be happy to suspend disbelief for two hours on stuff such as Lincoln's assassination, Mayan treasures, Mount Rushmore geography, and all that other nonsense. No problem there. But the point of a treasure hunt movie is the ability to follow the main character in his struggle, perhaps struggle with him, see him figure things out and perhaps guess with him. For this to work, the universe of the movie doesn't have to be consistent with the world we live in, but it has to be consistent with itself. But the universe of this movie is like a great big fairy tale, with the central character pulling white rabbits out of his sleeve whenever he needs them. Yes, the movie tries its hand at some drama, but it just doesn't work. Things go pretty smoothly for the most part---into the Queen's office, out of it again, oops, we are being chased, heck, let's take a photo, oh no camera, ah, there is a traffic camera, yep and by the way, can you just hack into the computer and download the pic, and on to the next event (same thing with the oval office, then kidnapping the president). While the hero thus McGyvers his way through an increasingly preposterous story, the whole thing just starts to feel stale, and you get the feeling that it might have been better if he had not stolen the Constitution in part 1, so the writers would not have to top this. The villain is lame and for the most part useless, not to speak of somewhat incoherent ('I am not going last, so I might as well go first'---say what?).None of the story really makes the slightest bit of sense, including the motivation of the hero (to clear the name of his great-great-grandfather---that's why he risks his life, the life of friends and loved ones, not to speak of his own good name by kidnapping a president!). It's all just a steaming pile of nonsense aimed at people who really do not give a damn about story and stuff, but who just want to see a lot of movement/action, high-tech gobbledygook, explosions, and cheap patriotism.However, as bad as the story was, (2), the bad acting was even worse. Everybody in this movie was disappointing, even a non-actor like Kruger. Her career should end with this movie, over, out, finito. She cannot do it, and it's not been for a lack of opportunity. If you had a consistent record of failure like hers in any regular job, you'd find yourself with a lot of spare time very soon. But even the real actors here just make you cringe---Greenwood, Harris, Mirren, Voight, they all deliver horrible performances that seem to betray their lack of passion and their paycheck mentality. We know they *can* act, we have seen it before, but they just don't in this movie. Keitel comes away without much harm---his part is so tiny, there just isn't a lot of opportunity to screw things up too badly.Why oh why do they keep making this fluff? Because for some reason we attend it. We go there, drop our cash, and watch this nonsense. I am guilty as charged. But if you haven't seen it, you and your money can still make a difference. Watch a good movie. There are plenty out there.",2,106,162,26 December 2007
The Hunger Games," Battle Royale minus humor plus cheese
","I do not know the book this movie is based on, but I sincerely hope that it is much better (and have been told that it is) than its adaptation. As it stands, the movie is a PG13 version of Battle Royale, with a hint of Running Man, a touch of Truman Show, minus any irony or humor, with a lot less gore (to keep it PG13 no doubt), and a lot more cheese.The one thing that might have set it apart from its many predecessors would have been the political and social background story which is hinted at in the brilliant but short performances of Tucci and Banks, but gets drowned out by the tedious, incoherent, and unconvincing attempts at action and cheesy teenage romance of the Twilight variety.Even though the 'action' is clearly intended to carry the movie, given the amount of time devoted to it, it is largely vapid PG13-type stuff, where the heroine MacGyvers her way out of a tight corner by dropping a hive of waspy insects onto her assailants --- who, in spite of being in a fight for their lives, guard her, and themselves, by collectively taking a nap at the foot of the tree their opponent is trapped in. Common sense isn't the strength of any of the contestants, which gallivant unguardedly and noisily through woods they know to be full of people out to kill them, and spend quite a bit of time publicly (and noisily) emoting when disagreeable stuff happens. Gimmicks abound, many of which easily predictable as they are introduced hamfistedly one by one during the preparation and training phase.Movie making is a business, and much of the revenue comes from young people, and there is every reason to believe that this movie is successfully catering to their tastes and preferences. Unfortunately for the rest of us, this means that all the interesting commentary on our own lives and societies that the source material might have contained is only a small subtext to a teenage drama that has been done before, better, sharper, and more convincing. The scenes with Tucci (equipped with dental enhancements that accentuate everything he does) and Banks (also in magnificent costume) are the highlights of this film, degrading the main action to mere filler for the teens. Unfortunately, for more than two hours, that's just not enough.",3,51,74,5 August 2012
Ice Age: The Meltdown," I tried to like it, but failed.
","No, I did not like this one. I liked the first---it wasn't necessarily the best animated movie, both technically and otherwise, but it had likable characters, it had soul, and it had a rhythm. Its sequel still has the characters (although it adds some that I found difficult to care about), but the rest... It becomes rather preachy in a lot of places, and too many of the lines that were intended to be funny just bombed, sometimes due to bad timing, sometimes just because the humor is awkward and contrived. That hurt the rhythm of the movie, which kills a comedy.On the positive side, the visual humor was up to the original. In fact, it had its best moments in the scenes with Scrat, the squirrel and its indefatigable chase for that elusive nut, which involved no dialog at all, but relied completely on the visuals, and the movement. That paradise scene is just absolutely hilarious, easy the funniest moment of the entire movie.I seems as though Scrat occurs much more frequently in the Meltdown than in its predecessor---perhaps the makers realized that their strength was animated slapstick rather than story and dialog.So, unfortunately, the sequel ends up being a number of very funny Scrat sequences interrupted by a mostly dull and occasionally outright annoying main storyline. I'd say that if you really liked the first, like I did, you will probably want to see The Meltdown nonetheless, just to have news from Manny, Sid, and Diego---and judging by the other comments here, there is a good chance you will like it.It's just, I didn't.",4,3,4,17 May 2006
Disturbia," Teenage pulp version of Rear Window.
","For some reason, Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is not listed in the 'movie connections', which seems more than odd, given the fairly obvious parallels in the plots---even the Netflix sleeve identifies it as a 'modern retelling' of RW. Respinning a tight masterpiece such as Hitchcock's original is a tall order, and even the best could be excused to not live quite up to it.Alas, the best weren't involved in this dud, and 'not living quite up' to the Hitch's standards really doesn't quite say it.It starts with the 'tightness' of the script and the setting. RW is claustrophobic, we get to see the world from the confined perspective of the protagonist, hardly ever leave the small room, see the rest of the world only from the titular window. By contrast, Disturbia starts in the great outdoors by establishing some father/son relation (only to crush it seconds later), and we roam the house and the neighborhood with that annoying kid and his useless friends. as for the script, where RW tells one story, this modern teenager turd throws in all kinds of target-audience compatible subplots and side stories, none of which contribute much to the main thrust.SPOILER ALERT.Then there are the characters---where RW had the socialite and the roaming photographer, Disturbia has a bunch of lame-brained teenagers. The protagonist's main problem is his need of a good parental spanking to aid his attitude adjustment. The next door hottie inexplicably falls for that numb nuts, and his friend is a completely useless and utterly unfunny individual. It's quite impossible to really care for these characters, and if the killer would not have murdered other people, you'd most likely side with him if he only makes these people go away.END OF SPOILER.But the worst, the WORST, part of this movie are the actors. All three teenage actors aren't great, but in ascending order of acting incompetence we have, at 3, Roemer, who is pretty but essentially not much else (and even on the pretty scale she is no Grace Kelly). LaBeouf, who is apparently groomed to be a modern version of the young John Cusack, comes in at 2---Cusack could act better even if he were drunk and in a coma. Whoever had the idea of giving this guy a leading role in a major production? At 1, though, the unrivaled Razzie champion of this movie, Aaron Yoo, who is the worst actor I have seen on screen in a while (and that includes Bill Pullman in Independence Day, as per a recent review). Boy, was he bad. There is not one appearance on the screen that does not make you cringe. He is a bad actor even if he just needs to stand around and do nothing. I kept hoping that he might get killed quickly, although now I am sure he would have been a bad act even as a corpse.In summary, it's an ill-conceived approach to retelling/remaking/ripping off one of the best suspense pieces of all time, written by someone who could have written American Pie (but instead wrote Buffy, Xena, Tarzan, and Animorphs), and acted by incompetents (nods to Moss and Morse, who did what they could---better luck next time with picking a script, folks).There must be something better that one can do with one's time. Watch Rear Window again, for instance.'When General Motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.'",3,0,2,22 September 2007
Independence Day," Mindless drivel.
","Boy oh boy. After a long time I saw this movie again---several years ago I watched parts of it on TV in a hotel room, and all I remembered was my incredulity at (SPOILER AHEAD) the president actually getting into a fighter plane himself to personally face the aliens. Lord almighty. Anyway, the thing was sitting on a disc somewhere, and I thought I'd give it another try, maybe it really wasn't that bad after all.Boy was I wrong.It actually turned out to be WAYYY worse than I even remembered it. I suppose watching it out of the corner of my eyes while preparing some talk slides or whatever I was doing made me miss the truly horrible acting and the absolutely preposterous screen writing of this cinematic monster turd. Bill Pullman's career should have ended right there and then. He is a pretty lame actor, but this was beyond bad---I have honestly seen better performances in middle school plays. The rest of the cast was mostly rubbish, too, although it's difficult to say because their characters were laughable. But nothing hurt as bad as Pullman's baby face affecting toughness, and failing. He is not alone, though, even the extras overact in ways that oscillate between really annoying and outright laughable.Another reviewer here explains the score of 'only six' by assuming that most people here saw the movie on TV, when it should be seen in the cinema. I suppose that might be true for someone who is mainly interested in special effects, grandiose camera movements, and lots of explosions---there is lots of those in this movie, and they are most likely better enjoyed on a larger screen.From my perspective, a score of more than six is hugely overrating this nonsense production, which is not best viewed in the cinema but rather not at all---at least for those of us who enjoy actors acting, and who think that 'suspending disbelief' does not mean shutting any brain activity whatsoever.Good things? Some visuals were okay, I like Goldblum (don't know why, I just do), and Will Smith was so-so. Save your time on this one, you deserve better than this. Anybody does.",2,29,58,11 July 2007
Twilight," Vampire mambo-jumbo for lame-brained teens.
","An ill-considered promise led to my ending up seeing this movie. Having discussed the novel series with the teenage daughters of some friends, I expected it to be gimmicky, vampire-themed teen trash, which it was, but even given that, it isn't very good.For one thing, it does not really work as horror, since the vampires aren't really particularly frightening, they are simply Marvel heroes with an awkward appetite. Sure, given their strength, you wouldn't want them to get angry with you, but neither would you like to antagonize the Hulk. As a matter of fact, most of the vampires are actually rather nice, some have teeny attitudes, others are brats or plain nasty, others are quite chipper and BFF material (well, not really 'forever', unless you manage to get bitten by one of them, which---unlike most of their cousins in film and literature---many seem to be rather reluctant to do). They are even pretty good-looking, in a Rococo makeup kinda way, and snappy dressers, too. The interior design of their abode has also come a long way since the count Vlad Teped in Transsylvania, and even though their sleeplessness has led them to do away with beds, their lack of appetite for, shall we say, regular fare luckily did not keep them from installing a kitchen---apparently on the off-chance that they'd befriend a doughy-eyed mortal chick. As a result, we get to see a gaggle of vampires cook dinner for our protagonist in their designer kitchen, and then go out for a round of baseball. The Prince of Darkness has arrived in 90210 and become the Brats of Twilight, and Mr. Stoker is rotating in his grave.Well, okay, so it's not a horror movie, but maybe it is a romance? Not really. Dull teen chick falls for equally dull teen vampire, and vice versa. He does not want to bite her, cause he and his vampire colleagues are, and I am not making this up, 'vegetarians', and he explains his plight by talking about how vegetarian food, while filling you up, somehow cannot, obviously, really satisfy. I wonder what they do with this part of the dialog in India... Obviously, living a really, really long time does not mean you learn anything. Besides the laughable premise, the fundamental problem with the romance angle is that, well, there really is no character arc. Both see each other, Cupid strikes, a little bit of high-school back and forth, and then it takes her five minutes of ham-fisted Web searching and a book order to figure out the 'big secret' (and, remember, she is definitely not a rocket scientist). From then on it's 'Hey, I know you're a vampire, let's get together shall we? Sure, come on over for dinner, meet the rest of the crowd.' Two teens having a crush on each other, only one of them happens to be a vegetarian vampire. No big deal.If you think that Hammer trivialized the vampire theme, you ain't seen nothing yet, specifically not this movie. Here, the whole vampire thing has nothing dark, nothing about good or evil, hell, God, Satan, sinful immortality, a painful existence in permanent darkness and seclusion, powerful at night and brittle and helpless by day, loss of identity in death---none of that. In fact, it seems positively attractive to be a vampire. Gone the Gothic feel of especially the early Hammer works and some later variations on that topic. The vampire theme is a gimmick, and because the old staples (cross, stake, water, sunlight etc.) weren't good enough for the iPod generation, these iVampires come with a whole new set of gimmicky attributes that no doubt dazzle the kids and have certainly been the focus of many middle-school discussions.Okay, so no horror, lame romance, maybe it works as a drama? Alas, for that it would have needed better actors in the leading roles. Stewart and Pattinson simply cannot act, their performances are flat, which is not helped by the fact that their parts lack any depth whatsoever. Ironically, this is best documented by Stewart's voice over which is probably intended to add depth to the acting by making explicit thoughts that are not evident from what is happening on screen. In this case, however, the narration reveals that Stewart's character has just about as much depth as the acting led us to suspect, i.e. not much. It also does not help that Pattinson really does not look that part of a heart throb---I guess it must be that vampire-magnetism thing, but it sure isn't his looks (even with a tan), or his elegant charm.Is there anything good about this movie? Not much. Burke and Clarke deliver decent work in their small roles. The technical work is mostly okay, but some of the special effects in the action sequences are 'Crouching Tiger'-laughable---they may have edited out the wires, but you don't need to see them to know that they are there. No, unless you happen to be a middle-school girl, you must have something better to do with your time. Come to think of it, even middle-school girls should find something better than watching this dull trash.",3,3,7,2 February 2009
The Mist," Horror for grown-ups: monsters + Lord of the Flies + On the Beach + Alien +, yeah, The Fog
","In a nutshell: One of the best horror flicks I have seen in a long time.Not knowing the book, and being generally only medium-impressed with Mr King's oeuvre, I started watching this without great expectations. A Fog rip-off with monsters is what I thought. Which is, at some level, what this is---a mist moves into town, brings a bunch of rather nasty creatures with it (very well done creatures, by the way), people get killed.But it is so much more. For one thing, in spite of how well done and terrible the creatures were, and in spite of the body count they racked up while going about their business being movie monsters, the true horror depicted in this movie, the one that sticks with you after the credits roll, has only tangentially to do with them, and in fact those creatures are nowhere near when it happens. At its core, this movie is not really about them, they are a plot device, almost a MacGuffin---to experiment with the question: How do you isolate and scare the living daylights out of your ordinary supermarket crowd, and what happens if you do? In themselves, the Mist Creatures do, of course, provide some good (and usually gory) entertainment. But then they trigger the Lord of the Flies/On the Beach storyline, and that is where this movie rises above the slasher/gore-fest genre. For one thing, it provides opportunity for some incredible acting, most notably by Harden, Sadler, and Braugher (in that order). Harden in particular shows another facet of her ample acting talent, in a performance that could easily among her best work so far---no small praise. Sadler probably has the part that has the broadest range, and he delivers the goods. The performance of the leading man is solid, too, but his character gives Jane a lot less to work with.The expose explaining the creatures is flimsy, quickly dealt with, and remains mostly irrelevant. That seems to be good judgment on the part of the filmmakers---focusing on the people at the expense of monster-effects makes the experience much more real, and it provides room for some plot that lesser horror movies would have invested in graphic violence and complicated exposes on the adversary. These monsters here come (SPOILER, if you want to call it that) somehow from another dimension, the military of course had to do with it, and that was that---who cares. The important things are happening in that supermarket away from giant spiders from another dimension.No matter how well done the creatures are, it is the story of that grocery store crowd that will stick with you after the movie is over, it is that story that makes this movie a must-see.",9,1,4,11 March 2008
Gran Torino," Forgettable and sanctimonious
","Eastwood's movies have to have a 'message', that is nothing new. Over the years, however, it seems that the message has become increasingly predictable, more boring, and its delivery hasn't improved either.The story itself is very ordinary: old man with several regrets and a few serious chips on his shoulder makes up with life, which in this case comes to him in the form of Asian neighbors. Confrontation gives way to friendship, which sets the stage for tragedy and a poetic resolution. Tons of clichés and no surprises are the hallmark of this film. At the very end it apparently intends to surprise the audience, but anybody who has paid the slightest bit of attention to the character arc of the protagonist can see that there is only one resolution left.To be sure, there are good moments. Eastwoods character is hilariously politically incorrect, casually filling his speech with racial epithets, and getting a number of funny lines out of it (obviously, folks who are easily offended will find it difficult to summon the required humor). Then there is a hilarious scene that Eastwood has with his barber, expertly played by the otherwise underused Lynch. It turns out to be the highlight of this movie.Much of the movie is sanctimonious and preachy; it obviously wants to tell us something about ethnic prejudice, and even inserts some expose about the Hmong people, for no apparent reason, as whatever would follow from it does not matter to the narrative. The transformation of Eastwoods character from bitter old man who despises everything foreign (including the foreign cars sold by his son) to cheerful participant at Hmong barbecues and confidant of and matchmaker for Hmong teenagers is ludicrous, and neither the script nor Eastwoods acting can make this believable. That is too bad, as it is the anchor for the rest of the story.Sanctimony is personified in the character of the preacher, whose offers of 'spiritual' support are originally rejected by Eastwoods character, but then gradually accepted, for no apparent reason other than that this guy just won't take no for an answer and even stalks the old man to his social gatherings. The protagonist, who otherwise has no problem defending his privacy (and his lawn) by pointing a loaded rifle at an offender, reacts to this outrageous behavior by inviting the 'padre' to a drink and shooting the breeze about life and death, revealing that neither of them had much to say about either of those two things, and resulting in one of the lamest simulations of 'philosophical depth' on screen in recent memory.But slushy messaging, sanctimony, and superficial dialog aren't even the worst offenders in this stinker. That distinction goes to the two key supporting acts, Vang and Her. Neither of them has the slightest clue about acting, remaining uninvolved throughout as in a middle school play rehearsal. That is bad for Eastwood, since their characters are supposedly what is melting the stony heart of his character, but it is really difficult to see how these two dull teenagers could possibly accomplish this. One of the reasons for Eastwood's lack of believability is the emptiness of their performances, particularly that of Her.And so the story moves to its predictable finish. We even get to see a 'resolution scene' showing how the old man deals with his greedy granddaughter in his testament, which feels like the closing scene in a 70s/80s TV series, when everybody gets together to share a good laugh about the final resolution.At the time of this writing, the movie's 8.5 rating has propelled it into Top 100 territory, so obviously people like it. To me, it wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen by a long shot, although it certainly is among the worst Eastwood films.",4,13,24,14 January 2009
Shrek the Third," As good as it gets, for the third in a series.
","There is good things and bad things about this movie, but I'd say that to its credit the main problem with it was unavoidable---it's the third in a series, and the main idea has been used twice already, is familiar to everyone, and the freshness of it is gone. For some franchises, the pain starts already in the second (Men in Black comes to mind, or Analyze That), when really nothing is added to an original (and initially surprising) premise, and it is merely milked for what it's worth, with usually sad results.I don't think that was the case with Shrek 2, and neither is it with The Third---the writers still find enough interesting and original ideas to weave into the story, they use the old characters to good effect and add interesting new characters to provide some novelty. The dialog is up to the (high) standards of its two predecessors, and the animation is stunning.All in all, even though it won't set new standards for animated features like the original Shrek might have, Shrek the Third is an entertaining movie that delivers what it promises---a good time with the titular hero and his friends (and family), nothing more, but also nothing less.",7,7,11,20 May 2007
The Dark Knight," Overlong, overfunded, overstaffed, overrated---merely okay.
","I suppose many people might be offended by the simple suggestion that this movie could be anything less than 'the best movie ever' or perhaps just 'the best movie of 2008', that it was merely okay, for superhero action drivel.But to me, that's what it was. It's the old good vs evil thing, the good billionaire dons latex suit to fight the evil for no apparent reason other than that he's the good guy, and the bad guy being ridiculously-over-the-top so, with a similarly solid rationale. Then there is the another good guy who has to experience a biographical kink in the form of a girlfriend blown to pieces and some cosmetically challenging facial events, and he becomes the semi-good guy. Lots of explosions, pseudo- technology, vehicles driving above the speed limit, lots of fighting, the end.I never really understood the appeal of the Batman franchise, which turned a unremarkable set of comic books (uh, 'graphic novels') into an unremarkable series of movies. Yet, many people seem to love it, and consequently another one of those hit the streets, bigger, better, more expensive, and this time with an IMDb rating that even made me curious.To be sure, there are many interesting and impressive aspects of the movie. The director, for one---I very much enjoyed Memento, and give Nolan a lot of credit for it. The cast of The Dark Knight is nothing short of impressive, with certified talent such as Caine, Ledger, Oldman, Bale, and Eckhardt. And, of course, the special effects are great, the fights are well-choreographed and fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent, and so on. It is, no doubt, a technically well-executed action flick, which I suppose is all that it wants to be, and probably all most of the people seeing it in the cinema expect it to be.But it is also other things. Overlong, for instance. The trivial comic-book plot does not sustain 150 minutes of interest, its self-indulgent repetitiveness becoming boring quickly, the little character development happening in cartoonish hit-you-over-the-head-with-hamfisted-symbolism style, the rest being fights, battles, destruction, and some more fights. The range of excellent actors that make up the cast remains woefully underused, although we do get so see some excellent acting, most notably from Ledger and Oldman. Ledger's Joker, in particular, does not require a very broad range, but it's far out in the crazy and psychopathic part of the spectrum, and Ledger manages to turn a fairly ridiculous and cartoonish villain into a three-dimensional and utterly creepy character, which is testimony to his acting ability. By and large, however, one does get the feeling that performance per talent ratio isn't a very good one, and that this crowd could have been put to better use in a more grown-up production with less of a focus on expensive action sequences.Overall, this movie is way over-hyped for what it is, it's not among the top ten movies of all time in my book, but then neither is 'Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Empire Strikes Back'. It does have its moments, though, but it could easily be cut down to 90 minutes.",5,20,40,26 August 2008
Green Street Hooligans," The elephant in the room.
","First off, I don't mind if a movie does not have a 'message'---I don't think it needs to, and frequently very good movies don't.That said, I cannot help feeling that this movie tried to convey a message, and that that message is complete and utter nonsense.An innocent intellectual American kid gets involved with a bunch of British hooligans, and learns a number of character lessons, stuff about standing up for yourself and knowing when to walk away etc. So far so good.But what about the biggest lesson in all of this, the big elephant in the room that does not seem to get a lot of attention from either the movie nor its main character---viz. that these people are hurting, maiming, and killing each other for no reason whatsoever, other than their misguided fanaticism for groups of entertainment millionaires, an adolescent sense of pride, and apparently an utter lack of anything actually worthwhile to do with their time and energy instead? As I said, I didn't necessarily expected the movie to go on moralizing about this, but seeing it glorify this total waste of time, energy, attention, and life was somewhat annoying. Senseless, idiotic violence perpetrated to the tune of fast-paced pop music? I am afraid this ain't no A Clockword Orange, and Lexi Alexander ain't no Kubrick, either.The scene that to me sums up the intellectual failing of this movie is the following. One guy, who 'raised his son to be a pit bull', who brought that teenage son to these fights with other gangs of hooligans, and whose son got killed in one of them, harbors this deep grudge against the leader of the gang they fought while his son got killed. I guess everyone here would see some suboptimal parenting skills as at least partially responsible for the young man's fate---had he not been born to this moronic thug whose main pastime was getting into fights with others like him etc.At some point, another character points out to him that his son's death is his own fault. You think: 'Finally someone says it.' Unfortunately, he then follows it up with his personal analysis of the father thug's failing---he did not protect his son enough during the fight. Sigh.Anyway, despite the somewhat inadequate central thesis that seems to underpin the movie, it's actually quite enjoyable. The acting is great all around, but to me Charlie Hunnam absolutely steals the show. Not only is he stunningly good-looking, he plays the role of the gang leader with incredible charm and complexity---if you had to be beaten up by a hooligan, it should be one like that. The film-making is more than adequate---screenwriter, photographer, and director do their best to make the actors shine, as is their job. From that perspective it's a decent movie, in spite of its other shortcomings.",6,0,0,5 July 2007
Grindhouse," You have to be tuned into this one in order to enjoy it.
","This movie (or movies) is an odd beast. There does not seem to be an obvious (to me at least) 'point' to it, so everyone looking for a message or closure will likely not get much enjoyment out of this one. Neither will those that insist on a tight narrative, or complex character studies. That's just not what this is.But what is it? Maybe it's like Kill Bill, but without the plot. It's a lot of action, a lot of self-aware and reflective toying with genres and viewer expectations, a lot of violence and gore, a lot of references, and a thimble-full of plot and characters. That's kind of what this is. Twice. With trailers.And, of course, it's done very, very well. Technically and artistically. It's original, inventive, visually striking, funny, gross, exciting, sexy, etc. etc.But is it good? That is, as always, in the eye of the beholder, but it seems to be even more true for this work than for most others. I loved it, chuckled, laughed hard, indulged in the visuals, and basically enjoyed this the way I would enjoy a roller coaster: you never know what's around the corner or past the dip, but you are prepared to have fun with it whatever it may be.My company did not. I suppose if you tend to sit in a movie with specific expectations, whatever they may be in this case, and measure the movie by the degree to which it manages to fulfill them, you are bound to be disappointed by ¨Grindhouse¨. Oddly, I find it difficult to say that it is a ¨good movie¨, not so much because it isn't good, but because it really isn't a ¨movie¨ the way a roller coaster ride is not transportation---it kinda is, but transportation is not the point.So I guess that's really the best way I know how to describe it---as a cinematic roller coaster ride. If you are in the mood for something like that, go and enjoy, otherwise maybe not.",7,2,7,7 April 2007
30 Days of Night," Could have been worse.
","So I ended up in a vampire movie. With Josh Hartnett. That certainly has all the potential for making one's blood boil and one's toes curl.Alas, it actually isn't such a bad movie. Sure, it's a vampire flick with a pretty boy as the star, but if you can get over that initial realization and the associated horror, and just go with the flow, there is a good chance you might enjoy yourself.There is some decent acting from a fairly interesting cast, there are some pretty scary and reasonably original undead, there are great visuals, obviously involving quite a bit of well-done gore, and even the script isn't all that bad. It's perhaps not an all-time horror classic, but it decent enough horror entertainment that could have been a lot worse.I even like the ending---some might find it a bit overly melodramatic, and it probably is, but it has original plot elements and also some nice visuals. Pretty good overall.",7,5,10,19 October 2007
Casino Royale," Actually, a pretty decent movie.
","To say it upfront: I am not a Bond fan. Haven't been since I was maybe 14. I find the old movies bad, horribly acted, badly scripted, with corny unfunny jokes, unbearably stereotypical characters etc. etc. The newer ones aren't much better, a bit more modern, better effects, but basically the same predictable super-agent drivel as the old stuff. Most of all, I tend to find those over-hyped discussions about who is going to fail to act in the role of this inconsequential Bond character most tiring.So it did come as somewhat of a surprise to me that I found myself in a screening of the latest installment of the series. I had not planned to watch another one of those in the cinema.However, what was even more surprising was that this one was actually a pretty decent movie. Not bad at all. Quite enjoyable, as a matter of fact.Much of that is due, of course, to the somewhat different Bond character. This will doubtless anger many fans of the series, but the latest Bond is a more believable character, almost human-like in its complexity, a character that engages in what might pass for actual relations with fellow characters in the context of this genre. Being quite fed up with the slick super-agent featured in the rest of the series, I found this was a welcome change.Craig does a respectable job at pulling off that role, and so does the rest of the cast. Obviously, the roles aren't of the great dramatic type, and the range required for them is no challenge to a fairly high-caliber collection of actors. Nonetheless, they do their jobs well, which is not something one can say about every action movie.In spite of some changes in the basic ¨flavor¨ of the movie, there are still enough of the other Bond attributes to satisfy any but the most fanatic fans: high production values, some great photography, beautiful women (also perhaps in somewhat more complex roles), fancy vehicles, a good dose of action, and lots of references, some of which outright hilarious (the scene in which he orders his martini rendered me helpless with laughter for a good minute or two). Gone is practically all of the corniness, the bad jokes and the lame-brained stereotypes (beyond, of course, the basic good/bad categories).What is left is a pretty decent spy/action flick, solid entertainment, beautifully photographed and professionally executed. If you could at all enjoy that type of movie, and if you are not someone who has firm a priori views on what actor should be playing Bond or how, or what elements ¨define¨ a Bond movie and therefore have to be present, I see no reason why you should not enjoy this one.",7,2,4,27 December 2006
300," Good visuals, simple story---rather boring, actually.
","I won't criticize the movie for being historically inaccurate. There probably is no 'accurate' account of these events anyway, the graphic novel it is based on took license with previous material without pretensions to historical accuracy, and so does the movie. I have no problem with that. Incidentally, I think that the ways in which the movie (following the novel) most obviously deviates from what is likely historical fact (such as the depiction of the Persians and Xerxes, for instance) are very original, and they make this a better movie.On the flip side, I also do not give the movie any particular credit for being an accurate representation of its source material. For one thing, I do not know the novel, but even if I did, I think the movie should stand on its own. If it can only be properly appreciated in reference to the graphic novel, it is a failure in my eyes.That said, I find the movie lukewarm, and certainly not deserving of the hype and the incredible IMDb rating it has received as of this writing (rank 186 in the Top 250). The visuals are excellent, there is a lot of gore and action, and it's executed brilliantly, with some stunning photography.However, the plot had me looking at my watch. There hardly isn't any. Basically your brain goes into screen saver mode while your eyes indulge in the graphic atrocities that audiences these days seem to enjoy feasting on. There really isn't much happening in this movie, other than a bunch of skilled brutes (skilled in being brutes, mind you) fighting against a much larger bunch of less skilled (and generally less attractive and less well-spoken---all the catchy one-liners are for the Spartans) brutes. If you know about the Battle of Thermopylae (how come we only ever get to hear the English translation of that name in the movie??), you even know how it all turns out, so it's not even a question of who is winning.Then what is it, apart from dismembered pieces of Greeks and Persians flying through the field of vision, that is supposed to keep your interest? Maybe it's the heroism. Chest-thumping machos in skimpy attire fighting for all kinds of things, including the continuation of Western civilization. If you like that sort of thing, I guess that would do it for you---there is certainly enough of it going around in this movie. I just could not care for the cartoonish (and that's no reference to the nature of the source, but to the quality of the characterization) characters and the boring and stereotypical views, speeches, and actions.Of course, the movie is not entirely without merit---the action is well done, the acting is not great but adequate for the purpose of providing the basic simplistic motivations for the massacre, photography/special effects are excellent. I'd say it's okay for what it is, i.e. a sword-and-sandal battle epic, but it's way over-hyped for what a lot a people make it out to be. It's certainly not #186 of all time.",5,12,24,19 March 2007
