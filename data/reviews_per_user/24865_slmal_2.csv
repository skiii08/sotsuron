The New World," divine journey
","OK sure, you know that the film goes for well over 2 hours by the time you leave the cinema but gees what a stunning piece of film. the characters are played down to a tee and the brutality of both side (natives + English) is explored and portrayed as they should be. i waited 5 months for the film to be released in Australia and saw it the day after it was released, it was worth the wait. and it's good to see some aussies in it...has the directors cut been released on DVD? i know that a lot was cut in the race for the 2006 Oscars. wonderful film, breathtaking scenery and excellent acting...i don't know why 'The New World' was nominated for more at the academy awards, it deserved a lot more...",8,1,4,19 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," media destroyed da vinci
","as someone who did not read the entire book (only the opening chapters). i still found 'The Da Vinci Code' enjoyable to watch. i tried to keep an open mind and not get expectations up too high because of the media attention surrounding the opening. in fact that's why i believe the reception for it has been so divided, the media truly destroyed this film. if it had of been kept a secret up till its release it would have received a much brighter opening. Tautou however i must say was amazing in my opinion as Sophie. i though she approached the part well. I was though a little let down by Sir Ian, i'm a little sick of him after LOTR & XMEN. a brilliant actor but i think someone like Michael Gambon may have suited it a little better, in my opinion. 'Da Vinci' is a good film, just keep an open mind, don't expect big things and you'll enjoy it more than you think.",6,3,8,19 May 2006
