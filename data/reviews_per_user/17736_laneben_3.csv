It," Absolutely hilarious
","I watched this with a friend at around 1 in the morning. I don't know if it was the movie or lack of sleep from the night before, but we laughed our asses off throughout this movie. There were one or two instances where the movie actually got a tiny bit scary, but that didn't last for more than 30 seconds each. After the semi-tense moment passed it was followed by some penny wise scene that was comedy gold. One time he jiggle ran at a kid and another he literally started bouncing side to side. I get this movie was aimed at a child's perception of fear, but my god this isn't what id call a horror movie. We constantly laughed throughout this movie (mostly at pennywise's shenanigans), and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Horror movie: 1/10 horror spoof comedy: 10/10",7,0,0,12 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," My favorite movie of 2019 and my 5th favorite of all time
","Pitt and Leo were awesome together in this movie. At times it was slow, yes, but the ending was well worth the wait. For those of you that don't know, this is a 'spoof' of sorts on the horrific Charles Manson cult murders in the late 60's. My family didn't know that going in and they were quite confused throughout the movie as to where it was leading to until the end.",10,14,19,22 November 2019
V for Vendetta," My favorite movie of all time
",V is my favorite character of all time. I can quote almost all of his lines in the movie and have watched this movie a dozen times. The movie shows the strong message that if we leave government unchecked what can happen. I feel as though people see this as a slam towards only the right wing politics. However this couldn't be farther from the truth. The government in the movie may be fascist but V is a freedom fighter. He believes in the truest forms of freedom. Left unchecked on either side of the political isle you will get Stalin or you will get Hitler. V's message is that we the people should not cower before our government but that our governments should cower before us so that we ensure freedom prevails over tyranny,10,0,0,17 April 2020
