The Ring," The Ring Lite is still Heavy!
","I've seen quite a few horror movies in my time, most I giggle through, some I gasp at, and then there are the handful of films that terrify me. The Japanese original made me lose sleep for days. The American version is slightly less shocking to anyone that has seen Sadako shake and jump toward the viewers, will find Samara a little less intense. I gave The Ring a 9 out of 10, only a few problems, that most American audiences will never notice, prevented the perfect score I gave the original.Though still incredibly scary and slightly reprocessed through the American film machine. The Ring still packs a punch. We as moviegoers should be ready to see a wave of American/Japanese remakes, as I believe that maybe now Western Filmmakers have realized the 'goldmind' of awesome movies and stories that only a select group have been privy to seeing. I only wished that the American Producers would give the credit due to the Japanese masters that they are working from!",10,0,0,28 October 2002
Memento," ... Remember Sammy Jankis ...
",This film is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie follows a classic Film Noir detective story with a modern take. You are taken backwards through the events in Leonard Shelby's life as he searches for his wife's murderer. He lives in a world of strangers and the only thing he can believe are the notes he leaves himself. I thought it was a very intriguing movie that has twists and turns throughout; and finishes with an ending that is just as mysterious as the revenge seeking Leonard. ....
