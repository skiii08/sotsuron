Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An instant classic
","As if we needed it, we have yet another existence proof that movie critics are stupid.  There are no major flaws in The Phantom Menace, only manufactured ones.  The only possible shortcoming I found is that the Gungans' dialogue is sometimes hard to understand.  If you liked what made Episodes 4, 5, and 6 great, you'll like TPM as well.For people who have seen the movie and want more, I recommend the book 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' by Terry Brooks.  Based on the George Lucas screen play, you can at least read about scenes that you won't be able to see until the Star Wars collector's edition is released with all 6 episodes in 2006 (or around then).",10,0,0,23 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park: The *&%@$! Musical
","Is it worth paying $7 to watch an extended South Park episode that doesn't have the cursing bleeped out of it?  That's the question that you'll have to answer before forking over your hard-earned money to watch this movie. Sure, there is some of the twisted humor that's given South Park it's cult following, but not really any more than a standard 30 minute episode that you can watch every Wednesday on Comedy Central.  Some of the musical numbers are pretty good, others seem like padding to get the runtime up to 90 minutes.  Bottom line:  If you're a South Park fan, don't miss it.  If you aren't, don't bother.",6,1,3,8 July 1999
