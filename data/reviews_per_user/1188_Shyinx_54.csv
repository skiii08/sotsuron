But actually they've done.Now this movie has cons also. Captain America's as* jokes and fat Thor was not good actually. They thought If Thor is beat Thanos in Infinity War and we need a weaken Thor. Actually they chose a bad way I think. Thor is real old character but we are not searching logic in these movies. So 5 years without fight was enough for a weaker Thor.

This is not the reason why the movie is good. We waited for a good villain for a real long time. Okey The Avengers was just the beginning and that movie was real good. Ultron can be much better villain but it didn't. The story of first and second Avengers movie was not so good. Second was even worse than the first one.

And also I know there is no better movie for a true Middle-earth fan. This movie is the best movie of the all time. This movie is the best movie of the future also. I am not talking about all of the people must love and say this movie is the best of all time.This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.'You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.'
<ul><li>Saruman</li></ul>'Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.'
<ul><li>Gandalf</li></ul>Both dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit.",10,3,3,14 June 2019

The story tells the truth about British in their language. Pay attention this movie. They killed more than 100 million people around all over the world. I'm so sad about Ireland and Scotland but they are not the only ones who have suffered. They killed, enslaved, torture but not in just Europe but also in Africa, Asia, America.I'm actually not talking about British people I'm talking about Kingdoms, Rulers, States, Governments. They are guilty but not the people are. Everyone needs to watch this movie. This is untold true story.",10,5,8,17 June 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Good contents but weak logicless storyline.
","I rated 7 because Acting, Cinematography, VFX, SFX are good but the script has logicless things. Water will never be gone from this planet. Water recycling is not a untrue thing. Did they even think about this? Even if water will be gone with some way, can it be gone in only 40 years later? It is impossible even we had The Great Nuclear War we can't see anything like this. Okey in this movie doomsday came out and all the water is gone. But wait how the cars are working? What kind of doom is this? All the waters is gone with heat or something? Then why the vaporized waters are not going back to them with rains? If the heat was a really big then how did they survived? As I sad bad story but good content.",8,4,7,10 July 2019
