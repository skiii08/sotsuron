The Blair Witch Project," Nothing happens
","The Blair witch project is the story of three student filmmakers who disappeared in the woods while searching for the Blair witch.That's it really, the film is 80 mins of three students wandering round the woods and nothing happening. The film is a rip off of the 1979 Italian cannibal film 'Cannibal Holocaust' but where 'Cannibal Holocaust' had a plot and characters, 'Blair witch project' has nothing.Nothing happens in this movie, there is no plot, no characters and after 80 mins the film just stops with no ending.Many argue that what makes the film scary is that so much is left to the viewers imagination. However this film has so little substance to it that you might as well just write your own film.I would advise that anyone looking for a scary film to avoid this one. However if you need a cure for insomnia, this is the film for you.",1,2,4,19 August 2012
