The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Better book in the series, worst movie in the saga.
","If you liked the book, then stay clear of this movie! I wouldn't say that I am the biggest Twilight fan, but I appreciate and loved the books as well as the first couple movies. However, I was GREATLY disappointed with this rendition on the book, or what they would like to call a 'movie'.First, the acting still sucks. Kristen Stewart still can't play anything besides awkward and strange. Robert Pattinson did a little better, but again he stuck to the awkward and uneasy character. Some people write that you 'could feel the love'; no what you felt was the urge to laugh hysterically when they were trying to be romantic or 'in love'. It kinda came off as a comedy because of all the cheesy lines and horrible acting skills.Second, unlike the other movies, it did not follow the books AT ALL!!!!! They changed the major parts in the book, just to make the movie seem more interesting. I was looking forward to the friendship formed between Seth, Leah and Jacob and how they banded together as a separate wolf-pack to protect the Cullens. All I got was 2 seconds of Esme delivering food, and Leah stating how she didn't want to be the pathetic ex-girlfriend anymore. It did not go into ANYTHING (except for Jacob stating in the strange wolf mind fight) about Jacob being the true Alpha and how Jacob is the only one who can give permission for the treaty to be broken and how Edward has to ask him to do so in order to save Bella.And what the hell was up with the Cullen, wolf fight towards the end of the movie? Horrible attempt to make the movie interesting, plus it NEVER HAPPENED IN THE BOOKS!!!! And the imprinting thing, not even explained so for those of you that have not read the books, be prepared to be confused about the glimpse into the future of Renesme and why the stupid fight ended.It was one of the worst book to movie attempts that I have ever seen and I am highly disappointed that I paid $10 to see this movie. To be honest, I probably won't go to see the next one, until it comes out in the Redbox.",2,21,40,18 November 2011
