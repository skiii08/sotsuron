Changeling," What a film!!!
","This is a film that you just can't take your eyes off. It has everything a good film should have and moves you in ways that may surprise you. Angelina Jolie is excellent and you totally believe she is experiencing these things. John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is very good and believable, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, is also perfectly cast. But the honour should surely go to Clint Eastwood who directs this film with such pace that what would normally be too long for a film seems too short. At the end you may feel a little cheated and wish it could have continued, I know I did. The young actor playing the child accomplice is also really good and you feel his emotion. I cannot recommend this film enough and despite some errors and artistic licence it tells what must have been a truly harrowing story of this poor woman's plight.",10,3,4,27 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The film is much better than most reviews I read on here
","Most of the reviews on here almost put me off watching this film. I recently got it on DVD and it is much, much better then I expected it to be. I do wonder what some people want from a film like this? They go on about all sorts of trivia stuff, but it IS a comic after all, it is not real life or meant to be. Huge Jackman did a great job as did the rest of the cast and although comic book purists might complain, to me it is still a darn good film that I enjoyed very much. I suppose I have the advantage of not reading all the comics so had no pre-conceived ideas about it all, but if you like action or fantasy films I don't see how you can fail to enjoy this movie? The special effects are amazing and the whole film moves along very fast with hardly a dull moment. I would recommend this film to anyone!",7,1,4,24 February 2010
Capote," One of the worst films I have ever seen
","I am sorry but 'Capote' is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is slow and the acting is positively comedic in places. The main character is irritating and unlikeable to say the least ( was the man really so creepy? ) I fail to see why anyone likes this film? Maybe it's just popular among the art-farty types to say it is a good film? For me all the things that make a good film are missing and I found myself hoping it was going to improve at some point ( which it did not ) I am also sure that the story itself could have been made more interesting, but it is hard to know how accurately it was all portrayed? Maybe Capote was such a creepy irritant and for this the lead actor could be congratulated for an accurate portrayal. But this in itself would not make a good film. Just how it even got nominated for any Oscars is a mystery to me. I was not alone in thinking this as those watching it with me all failed to enjoy it in any way whatsoever.",1,12,23,14 June 2010
Save the Last Dance," Great Film
","I have seen this film in DVD shops for ages but figured it was just a chick flick so never bothered to buy it even when it went to under Â£3.00 Then it came on one of the movie channels so I decided to give it a try. Now I am going to buy it next time I see it. This is a very good film, well acted by everyone and with a story that covers some difficult subjects very well indeed. I thought that Julia Styles was perfect and looked very awkward when she first started dancing hip hop but became believable just as she would have done learning from scratch a new dance form. I thought her ballet was less convincing and it even looked like there was a double in there at times. But over all an excellent film and well worth a watch.",7,1,4,1 October 2009
2012," Great Special Effects .... Awful Acting and Directing
","The good thing about this film, and it is possibly the ONLY good thing, is the CGI. The special effects are among the most incredible seen in film, however that alone does not rescue it. At 158minutes it is much too long and the so called emotional element misses the mark completely. There are some really awful moments where I suppose we are expected to care? The lead actor is just dire and Woody Harleson's character is just a stupid edition to all the other characters we quickly could not care less about. The story could have been good but the director just seemed to mess it up at every point and the acting was just terrible throughout.One can only wonder what Spielberg would have done with the budget that this film had?",4,1,2,19 July 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great Acting but very dull film
","I watched this because of all the hype and Oscar nominations but must say I was very disappointed. At best it is watchable but it plods along and is little more than a snapshot of events that were very important in American history. The acting is superb especially the lead characters but the pace remains pretty much the same throughout the entire film. It is a short film, probably because there was nothing else that they could have added using the format they decided to use. Maybe on a cold rainy day you could watch this but don't expect too much from it as I did. I notice many positive comments here about this film so I may be in the minority ( although the person watching this film along with me fell asleep a third of the way into the film ) Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was that it had no moments that lifted me. What were undoubtedly emotional events fell flat the way they were portrayed.",3,0,6,15 July 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Better than Schindlers List
","This is a brilliantly made film about a very disturbing subject. Those who question whether a Jewish boy would be allowed to sit by the fence of the concentration camp are missing the whole point of this film. I am sure it is not meant to depict an actual event or even suggest that it could have happened. What this film does so well is explore the many different emotions of each character. Just how a person such as the father could be both good ( to his family and friends ) and totally evil to others.( The Jews ) This dichotomy is also seen in the young SS soldier. The innocence of both children shows how stupid the whole racist argument is. The women in the film show that not everyone agrees with the evil being done but have the dilemma that they are married to their men and cannot come to terms with them doing or believing such evil things. Young Jack Scanlon who plays Shmuel,is outstanding as is Asa Butterfield as Bruno, the camp Commandant's son. But all the actors play their parts exceptionally well. Did this film win any Oscars? It really should have won in just about every category since it is one of the best films you will ever see. Much better than Schindlers list because it doesn't show the gore and violence in any graphic way, but you are left to use your imagination, which can be much more horrific. ( something Hitchcock used to do so well ) This is a good film for anyone with racist tendencies as sadly mankind has not moved on much since those awful days that this film depicts so well.",10,2,3,7 April 2010
Clash of the Titans," Big disappointment
","Sam Worthington was the wrong person to play Perseus in this awful remake. He is wooden and has no screen presence but worst of all why did he keep his hair like that? All the other actors made an effort to look the part, but he looked like a modern soldier who had been sent back in time. Added to that the fact that his accent was clearly Australian or New Zealand, ( I don't care which ) he really stood out for all the wrong reasons in my opinion. The CGI was outstanding but the sequences themselves surprisingly boring. I didn't care about the outcome too much and the only one that was remotely good was the Gorgon sequence near the end. A lot of the monsters were over done, especially the scorpions, it was a bit unbelievable that they could have been so easily defeated. The way the story was shown in this remake also lacked humour apart from the golden owl send up ( always hated that owl in the original anyway ) But as I said the main failing was Sam Worthington's totally unbelievable performance. This could have been a better film with a stand out character in the lead role.",4,1,2,23 August 2010
The Hurricane," Denzel Deserved an Oscar
","I am not going to get into details regarding how true an account this is or not. I have read a lot that seems to indicate he was guilty and others that he was innocent, both accounts seeing to contradict themselves. I guess we may never really know, but as someone who believes that racism infects a lot of society including organisations like Sporting bodies and the police I can well believe that being black would not guarantee a fair trial. However I also find it hard to believe that Mr Carter was as peaceful a person as depicted in this film. But this is down to the way the film was written and directed and in no way detracts from a truly remarkable piece of acting by Mr Denzel Washington. It seems in every part he plays, you believe that he IS that character and this film was no exception. In the boxing scenes or the prison scenes and in every scene you believe that you are watching Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter. A truly outstanding performance.",Null,20,29,2 August 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Better than I expected
","I never went to see this when it came out in the cinema and watched it on TV while abroad. I was surprised at what a good film The Da Vinci Code is. Has Tom Hanks ever given a bad performance? And Aurey Tatou was also excellent in a film that showed her intellect as well as her beauty. In my opinion Ian Mckellen overacts ( as do many stage actors when on screen ) but that can be forgiven as the film moves at such a fast pace with lots to keep me glued to the screen. The premise behind the story is all nonsense as has been shown many times, but as others have said this is fiction, so taking it for what it is, I loved it and even bought Angels and Demons on DVD to see if that is also as good.",7,1,2,17 February 2010
The Wrestler," If ever a guy deserved an Oscar
","If ever a guy deserved an Oscar it is Mickey Rourke for his portrayal of Randy ( The Ram ) Robinson in this film. I believe he lost out to Sean Penn who played some gay guy no one cares about in the film Milk? Marisa Tomei also does an excellent job as a really believable lap dancer, she works well as both the sleazy stripper and hard working mom. For me she had the perfect mix of glamour and ordinariness to pull this off.But it is really Mickey Rourke who steals the film with more realism than any film of this genre I can think of. Not even Stallones Rocky comes this close to accurately portraying such a sad character who is top of his field but sliding into obscurity or even near death.Evan Rachel Wood also does a great job as his estranged daughter and the scenes between her and her Dad ( Randy ) are some of the most moving in the film.Bear in mind that this is NOT a family film and contains some pretty adult scenes ( both violent and sexual ) but what really makes this film so good is Mickey Rourke's superb acting. For me he was robbed of the Oscar for sure. Fortunately Mickey Rourke won a BAFTA",8,2,3,16 March 2010
Ray," Genius film about a genius
","This must rat as the best biopic ever. Jamie Foxx IS Ray Charles, at no time in the film did it seem like someone acting as someone else. Jamie Foxx moves lives and breaths Ray Charles. In fact part way through you forget that this ISN'T Ray Charles because the portrayal is THAT good. The film may not be 100% accurate but it takes you to the place and time when these things happened. You marvel at the genius of this blind boy and the music just takes you back in time. Also of note is that it doesn't try to gloss over Ray's bad side, especially his drug addiction and the appalling way he treated his women, especially his wives. All the supporting actors are very believable ( although the women Ray surrounded himself with did not look THAT good ) maybe feeling the wrist is a poor indication of beauty? If ever a man deserved an Oscar Jamie Foxx did for this excellent movie. It rates as one of the best films of all time in my book.",10,0,2,28 July 2009
Taken 2," OK But Not as good as the first film
","This is watchable but it is hard not to compare it to the first film which was outstanding. I won't go into all the plot holes as everyone else has mentioned these, but there was a lot of 'as ifs' coming from my lips as I watched this. The first one was very clever and kept you guessing but this one was not very believable as many have already said. All the acting was first rate but the director and script writer let the film down. The fight choreography was really bad and the final fights particularly badly done. Over all it was a wasted opportunity to build on an excellent first film. All too often Hollywood seems to push out sequels without much care. Sherlock Holmes, Iron man etc all had awful sequels In fact only the Bourne films seemed to get it about right.",5,1,1,5 August 2013
