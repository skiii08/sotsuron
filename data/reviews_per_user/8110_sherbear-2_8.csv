Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too confusing!
","I had no trouble understanding the original Star Wars movies.  But this one, even after four viewings, I still don't understand what was really going on!!  The acting was alright for the most part, except for Anakin.  I didn't find that boy suited the role at all.  And Jar-Jar... what was that all about?  It was like Lucas knew that a bunch of kids would be watching, so put an irrelevant character in for comic relief.  How annoying.  I hope the next movie is more clear cut with a better storyline and a better Anakin Skywalker.",Null,0,1,27 May 2001
Mulan," Wow.
","Definitely one of my favourite Disney movies ever.  It's always nice to see a female come to the rescue.  And after Hercules, I'm glad that the villains in this movie were actually scary.  A chill went down my spine during the mountain scene.  And the ending was great too, not completely wrapping up the story like most Disney movies do.  Excellent work.",9,8,9,12 May 2001
Cast Away," Not enjoyable at all
","I had great expectations of 'Cast Away', considering Tom Hanks is my favourite actor.  I was very disappointed.  I felt no emotion for any of the characters, least of all Chuck, even though Tom Hanks did do an excellent acting job and definitely deserved the Golden Globe.  Also, the story line was way too jumpy.  The best scene in the movie is the storm scene.  That was the only part of the movie that had me fully interested in the fate of Chuck.",5,0,1,12 February 2001
Moulin Rouge!," For the people who hated it...... (Spoilers!!!!!!!)
","I have a suggestion for you.  Watch it again.  The first time I watched it, it was all I could do to sit through it until the end.  I too was disgraced at the anachronisms, especially musical.  Nothing was accurate to 1899 Paris.  Then when it ended, I thought to myself, 'I kind of understand what this is all about.'  So I rewound it and watched it again.  Since then I have seen it three more times.  It is my all-time favourite movie.  Watch it again and don't take it too seriously.  Realize that everything, accurate to 1899 Paris or not, is there to help tell the story of their love.  Allow yourself to laugh at the silly 'Like a Virgin' dancers and be shocked when Christian yells, 'Because she doesn't love you!'  Forget that it's predictable and not historically correct.  Get lost in the story, music, and visual effects, and I promise, you will cry when Satine dies.",10,1,2,18 June 2002
Meet Joe Black," Wow!!!
","(may contain spoilers)It disappoints me when people criticize this movie for being slow-moving and long.  Yes, the movie is long, but it is just as long as it needed to be. Any shorter and the effect would not have been the same.  And as for slow-moving, I guess it's a matter of opinion, because I have seen this movie numerous times and it always holds my interest and never feels slow. The acting is absolutely amazing.  The guy in the coffee shop and Joe Black are obviously two completely different characters.  And it is easy to pinpoint the exact moment that Susan realizes that there is something different about Joe Black.  The actors truly became the characters.  In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with this movie.  The music was wonderful, the script was well written, the actors were captivating, and most importantly, it holds an important lesson about life and love.  Well done.",10,1,1,12 March 2001
Hercules," Tries too hard to be funny.
","As a big fan of Disney movies, I must say this is a disaster.  I disagree with the person who said that it grows on you; I find it to be the opposite. The first time I saw it, I was indifferent.  The second time, I was bored. The third time, it had been a few years so I wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered it to be.  Well, I was wrong, it was worse.  The jokes are forced, the characters are unlikeable, the animation is horrible, and the music is not up to Disney's standards.  Quite disappointing.",Null,1,2,12 May 2001
The Green Mile," All I can say is, WOW!!!
","I know a movie is good when not only do I cry for half of the movie, but I also cry for an hour AFTER the movie is over.  This is a movie that will stay with you for weeks afterwards.  The acting is amazing and the storyline is touching.  I have also read the book, and I'm happy to say that the movie is very faithful.  'The Green Mile' is a must see!",10,0,1,13 February 2001
The Truman Show," Not very far from reality....
","The Truman Show is quite an amazing movie.  Once it ended the first time I saw it, I went through the next few days looking for hidden video cameras and suspecting everyone.  That's the impact this movie had on me way back in 1998.  If I had seen it for the first time in the year 2001, I wouldn't have been quite as shocked, since shows like 'Survivor' and 'The Mole' have become quite common.  I pray that a storyline like Truman's stays in the movies and isn't transfered to reality TV.  Anyway, bottom line, this is an exellent movie that really makes you think.  Jim Carrey proves his talent beyond comedy with this role.",10,0,0,8 June 2001
