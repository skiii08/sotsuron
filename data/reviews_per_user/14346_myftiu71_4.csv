The Ring," Excellent movie ... but intensely terrifying?? I think not.
","I just saw 'The Ring' and I loved it ... the video itself was extremely disturbing as were several other scenes. And the overall atmosphere was extremely creepy, mostly due to the use of music and sound effects. But the film is nowhere near 'intensely terrifying' or 'the best horror film ever.' I'd give it an 8, but there are many horror films that are much better ('The Shining,' 'Jacob's Ladder,'The Exorcist' 'Last House on the Left') Who know's, maybe I've just seen too many horror movies to really be scared anymore. I just wasn't completely terrified. It's an excellent film, but not all it's hyped up to be. Maybe all that hype is what left me a little disappointed at the end. All I know is that I won't be scared everytime the phone rings or the TV shows static, like someone I know told me they were when they went home after seeing the movie. And by the way, to clear up another misconception, 'Blair Witch Project' was not scary.",8,0,0,9 November 2002
Minority Report," I'm blind, but it's good
","Loved the movie, though it was a bit predictable. Special EFX great as usual with Spielberg. The only thing that bothered me was the tint of the film. The often blaringly bright background was blinding me at times.But it's still a great film.",8,0,0,30 December 2002
Titanic," What's the big deal? ... and I hate Celine Dion
","OK I guess, but nothing special.And I automatically have to lean toward not liking it because the melody from that damn Celine Dion song was playing in the background at various speeds FOR THE ENTIRE MOVIE ... I wanted to strangle someone by the time the movie was half over. There has to be some other melody you can play once in a while. Scary thing is, I think it won an Oscar for best score ... which makes no sense since there's only one song in it over and over...Regardless, it's very overhyped and I could think of many other ways to spend 3+ hours of my time that are much more worthwhile.",Null,2,3,21 November 2002
Paths of Glory," Brilliant ... Early glimpse of Kubrick's genius
","WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW 'POG,' in my humble opinion,  is the greatest war film ever made. Beautifully made under Kubrick's directionGreat writing, Brilliant acting ... The batlle sequence is one of my favorites scenes in movie history. And the closing scene with the German girl singing (Christiane Kubrick, thenSuzanne Christian) still brings tears to my eyes ...One of Kubrick's best, just behind 2001 and Dr. Strangelove (BUT NOT TOOFAR BEHIND ..... THEY'RE ALL SO GOOD!!!!)",10,0,1,9 November 2002
