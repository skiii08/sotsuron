Hereditary," Boring and sadly expected
","WARNING INCLUDES SPOILERS
I read the reviews and they were glowing. I was ready for something to really get me.. make me jump, scare me even a little.It started slowly, and I assumed it was just saying the exciting bits for later. Charlie loses her head.. yawn. The mother is wicked and dreams of telling her son she wanted him dead.. been there, saw that. yawn. The unbelieving husband is the one that fries.. yawn. Mom crawls on the roof, saws her head off.. yawn, yawn, yawn. There was no reason or rhyme. I mean I get it, Grandma was stupid and into satan worshipping, sure that can bring evil spirits, but come on... this was so boring.I'm shocked anyone liked it. I know common sense is a lost art, but common good taste? This was boring.Boring. Boring.... Boring. I was even bored having to recollect the movie. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.",1,1,6,23 April 2019
