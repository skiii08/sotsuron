The Rock," wonderful action film, funnier than you'd expect (SPOILERS)
","In the first twenty minutes, two separate rooms must be evacuated because of two potential explosions.  And we don't get to relax much between the two events.  We don't get to relax much at all.  Even the slow-paced scenes will generally keep you on the edge of your seat.Nicolas Cage is the FBI agent who solves the second problem, and he is at home relaxing when his girlfriend announces she is pregnant and wants to get married.  Meanwhile, a group touring Alcatraz is locked up by a bunch of bad guys in camouflage uniforms (this is actually sort of funny).  The head man (Ed Harris in a compelling performance) threatens to release poison gas in San Francisco (enough to kill a million people) unless the government gives him enough money to sufficiently compensate the families of numerous men who served under him in several military actions.  The general has a war record that brings to mind the song 'The Twelve Days of Christmas,' yet he is now a traitor who considers himself to be like one of the Founding Fathers.Cage is called on to be a part of the team that will take back Alcatraz and defuse the situation, though he has no combat experience.  His girlfriend wants to come along to San Francisco when Cage assumes he is being called for a training exercise.  Later, she refuses to stay behind after he tells the truth.  Only one man can make this operation work:     He is so dangerous he has been behind bars for over 30 years, and he is the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz, though the government will not acknowledge his existence.  When working for British intelligence, he uncovered secrets connected to Roswell and JFK but didn't do what he was supposed to.Lots of good acting performances here.  Where to start?  At first Cage did not remind me of other characters he had played, so that was enough to make his performance a good one.  But he was occasionally funny as would be expected, especially in the scenes where the Alcatraz expert is first released and being interviewed.  Sean Connery is good as usual, thoroughly evil at first when he gets out of prison, but also funny; he wants a penthouse  suite and the best of everything if he's going to help these people.  Later he is mostly tough but also shows a tender side, in one scene with his illegitimate daughter and in several good scenes with Cage.  Cage's boss in this operation, who I believe is now on 'The West Wing,' was also quite good.  The best purely comic performance:  the apparently gay barber who cuts Connery's hair (yes, he has hair, quite long at first).  I think every acting performance was good, even right down to the people with one or two lines.You like car chases complete with wrecks and explosions?  This movie has a good one.  And it's funny too.  Lots of funny stuff in the first half, despite the serious nature of the situation.  The second half has some comedy but is much more serious and quite violent.  The first half is violent too.  And the language was probably quite graphic as originally shown.SPOILERS:  Connery ran away three times, the first time in that car chase when he was searching for his daughter, whom he had never met.  The second time, he returned to the operation out of concern for his daughter.  The third time, he came back so Cage's child would have a father.  He did have a heart.  And the ending was funny:  a pastor chases Cage out of a church Cage damaged in order to take possession of...THE SECRET TO JOHN KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION!",Null,2,2,21 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not my taste but seems like a quality production
","I had heard how bad these movies were and avoided them. It just so happens a local station recently showed this movie but I haven't seen 'Vol. 1'.This does not live up to the stern warning that preceded it. I've seen movies which, even cleaned up for TV, were far more violent.Uma Thurman gives one of her great performances here. I enjoyed the martial arts training and the pleasant family scene near the end the most. But when she was dirty and out for revenge, just look at that face.The scenes where Beatrix was buried had to be a real challenge. There were four walls, but just not at the same time. Where we saw her feet had to be the hardest.I was expecting a lot more comedy, the way this was promoted. But what comedy there was I liked. Even if it was dark. Uma Thurman as her much younger self in school, for example.Some great stunt work was done in one of the martial arts training scenes. Either that or CGI.David Carradine also impressed.While I didn't care for Daryl Hannah, I can't deny she was good. A long way from the type of character in 'Splash' (which I liked far more).Perla Haney-Jardine gave one of the best performances of all, really a delight as the 4-year-old daughter of Bill and Beatrix. And despite the nature of the movie, her first scenes were appropriate family viewing, should one want to watch just those, with the caution that in an age appropriate way, the girl is told her father shot her mother and that while pretend violence is not harmful, there is real violence that hurts.An impressive effort. Just not my taste, for the most part.",Null,0,1,31 July 2014
Ali," Not even Will Smith could really capture The Champ, but he tried
","Could be spoilers for those not familiar with Ali's life or certain historical events.When I first heard Will Smith was being considered for the role of the greatest boxer ever, I thought it was a big mistake.  He doesn't even look like Ali.  I have liked Smith as an actor ever since I first saw him on 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', and even then it was obvious he had potential. Who knew he had THIS much ability?Still, I had trouble seeing Ali on screen, because even the attempts to make Smith look like The Champ didn't really work.  I still saw Will Smith.  Most of the time I heard Will Smith.  But there were times when he sounded just like Ali, where Ali had obviously done the humorous, charming smart-aleck routine on TV, giving Smith a chance to see exactly what to do.  And humorous, charming and smart-aleck are exactly what Will Smith does best. Overall, I thought Smith did as well as he could possibly do in the role. Only Ali could have played Ali, but he can't do it now.
I thought the movie effectively captured 11 years in the life of Cassius Clay, including the name change to Muhammad Ali.  I especially liked Ali's attitude toward those who continued to use his 'slave name'.  And the scenes involving his religious conversion and disputes with Malcolm X proved interesting, though I never really understood what was going on. The scenes involving Ali's attempts to avoid military service were also well done. I'm no boxing fan, so I didn't care that much for the boxing itself, but Ali was always my favorite boxer.  And the boxing certainly looked realistic and even painful.Jon Voight did a great job as Howard Cosell.  He and Ali together were wonderful.  And I even saw a new insight into their private relationship (something similar happened with Joe Frazier).  Jamie Foxx had his good moments as Bundini, and Mario Van Peebles did Malcolm X as well as I've ever since him done.  Of course, I still have yet to see Denzel Washington in the role. If there was one weakness other than the fact no one could truly capture Ali, it was the absence of Martin Luther King.  I saw LeVar Burton's name in the credits, and in an amazing coincidence, one of the witnesses to King's shooting was on the phone to someone in the movie at the time!  But I can't recall seeing King alive.This was a movie worth seeing.",Null,0,1,1 June 2004
The Longest Yard," Worthy remake but not quite up to standards of the original
","The movie begins with multiple images of a hot girl in a bikini. This is during a party at the San Diego home of Lena, girlfriend to former star football quarterback Paul Crewe. Lena's dress appears likely to have a Janet Jackson moment. Paul and Lena get in an argument and Paul takes her fancy car, driving around town in such a way that he attracts the attention of the cops. By the time the brief but exciting chase is over, Paul has violated his probation for point-shaving, which gets him sent to a prison in the middle of the Texas desert.Warden Hazen wants a successful prison league football team and believes Paul can make that happen. Guard Knauer threatens Paul if he does what the warden wants. After some time in the hot box, Paul goes along with the warden anyway.Paul doesn't have much luck, even with the help of sidekick Caretaker. Success comes only when longtime inmate and former football star Nate becomes the coach, and when the inmates realize playing football means playing against (and beating up on) the guards. And even then, the team isn't that good.But can they succeed?I saw the original where Burt Reynolds was the star. He was better there though quite good here, and the original was the superior movie, but this one is pretty good too. Adam Sandler is satisfactory. His best moments are when he insults a cop who resembles Armin Shimerman (though that actor is not in the credits) whose appearance invites ridicule, and during half-time in the game. Chris Rock gives his usual performance, which like pretty much everything he does just has to include ranting about blacks being mistreated and everything being about race. That's part of his appeal, at least to me.Cloris Leachman stands out as Lynette, the secretary to the warden. Most of her scenes are ... not exactly family viewing.This is a men's prison, but there are 'women' other than Lynette. They are the cheerleaders. The standout of that group is played by Tracy Morgan, flamboyantly gay and hilarious. Yes, they're actually men.James Cromwell is good enough, though Eddie Albert somehow seemed so much more cruel in the original. Maybe it was because I was used to the actor being such a nice guy (and even when he was mean to Haney and the Monroes, it was nothing like this). I think I'm correct that Bob Sapp is the big teddy bear who cries. He's really funny.Chris Rock is reunited with his TV dad, sort of (I can't recall whether they hared any scenes). Although he didn't do much other than hand out food from McDonald's, it was interesting to see Crews as a genuine tough guy after two hours of watching him be a clueless dad on his latest series.Steve Reevis must have been the funny sports commentator. His partner kept expecting him to say something, and yet he mostly just sat there looking dignified. If he said something, it needed to be said.This movie definitely scores a touchdown. It's the original that goes for two and succeeds.",Null,0,0,5 August 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Brilliant, especially DiCaprio
","On Leonardo DiCaprio's 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn't realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on 'Growing Pains'--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn't see much to like about 'Titanic' except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, 'Romeo and Juliet' was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.But if he could be nominated for his 'Aviator' performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive', or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in 'Smokey and the Bandit'. The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.Frank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.Tom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.I loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from 'To Tell the Truth' was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn't feel I had time to watch the new version).This was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn't seem to agree.",Null,87,101,11 November 2005
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," The superior version, but Glenn Close's Cruella was better
","Pongo is a bachelor living in a London apartment whose pet Roger needs a woman. He searches for just the right mate for Roger, and after several tries discovers a woman with a Dalmatian like Pongo.  Did I mention that Pongo is a dog?  Pongo schemes to bring Roger and Anita together and eventually finds success.  When the two humans get married, it appears the dogs do too.  Several months later, Anita's old friend Cruella De Vil, a nasty rich woman with strange hair, comes to visit because she has heard Pongo's mate Perdita is having puppies.  It is not yet time, but Cruella insists on being informed when the time comes.  She shows off her beautiful fur coat and comments on how beautiful the dogs are.  Several weeks pass and, at last, the big moment arrives.  Nanny the quirky housekeeper comes out to announce to Roger that the puppies have arrived.  He asks how many and she replies eight.  That's a lot, but Nanny keeps coming out to announce there are more puppies.  The eventual total: fifteen.  How can this family keep so many dogs?  They'll find a way.  Cruella comes just in time, offering money for the puppies, figuring the couple cannot afford to care for them all, but it is too soon to take them from their mother.  Anyway, Roger does not feel at all comfortable about making any promises to this woman.  When the puppies are older, two strange men come to the door insisting the law requires them to inspect the house's wiring.  When they leave, the puppies are gone.  We later find out Cruella knew these men, and when human attempts to find the puppies fail, Pongo and Perdita communicate with the other dogs in the city.  While all of London must put up with the excessive barking (some of which cbmes from dogs we saw earlier when Pongo rejected their owners) the message finally reaches the countryside, where a horse, a duck, and a cat join in the search.  The cat remembers hearing puppies at Cruella's rundown old mansion in the country (the name of which sounded very un-Disneylike) and goes there to investigate.  The men are there, along with 99 puppies.  The question now is how to rescue the puppies before they become fur coats?Overall, this movie was better than the live-action version, but not by that much.  I recall the villains being more cartoonish and not as well-acted. On the other hand, I thought Glenn Close's deliciously over-the-top performance was the better one of Cruella, partly because she made Cruella more human and less of a cartoon.  I also liked the physical comedy in this version but recall there being more of it in the other movie.  All of the acting performances in this version were good, and it sounded like children doing the puppy voices, which was very effective.  Naturally, this version focused more on the animals.  The animation was quite good but maybe not as detailed as in some early Disney films.  I felt like the degree of detail came up short in at least one outdoor scene where we saw the dogs from a distance.  Pongo talked most of the time, but it sure sounded like Lassie when he barked (not a problem really; Lassie was a very good actor). Possible concerns for parents:  I'm not sure what word I heard one of the puppies say, but the mother chastised such language, and Pongo looked ashamed when Perdita wondered where the puppy could have heard such a word. I mentioned Cruella's old mansion.  And a possible SPOILER:  as in life, one of the puppies didn't make it, and Nanny had the sad task of bringing in that puppy to Roger.  Or DID that puppy make it?Overall, a wonderful job.",Null,2,3,13 January 2003
Amistad," Well done, not as unpleasant as I expected (SPOILERS)
","Despite the stern warnings from ABC TV (even though it was an edited version), I did not see that the total amount of violence in this movie was anything to get alarmed about.  True, the violence was graphic and unsettling at two times during the movie, once at the very beginning and once about halfway through.  The second set of violent scenes certainly exceeded the first for brutality.  How anyone could treat other human beings as slave traders treated these Africans is beyond me.  Still, I can't say that this movie did for slavery what 'Schindler's List' did for the Holocaust.  This is, in fact, primarily a movie about a murder trial and about the debate over the nature of slavery and how it relates to the specifics of this case.At the beginning of the movie, Africans being held captive manage to revolt and take over a slave ship.  Six weeks later, they are captured and taken to the United States to be tried for murder. A free black man named Joadson, who the Africans consider to be 'a white man' because he dresses and acts like whites, goes to Washington to get Congressman John Quincy Adams to help with the cause.  Adams declines, not once but several times.  Eventually alawyer named Baldwin agrees to represent the Africans, believing that they cannot be tried for murder because they are merely property.  The murder trial begins with several requests to decide not guilt or innocence, but what should be done with the Africans.  The teenage queen Isabella II of Spain has a claim, as do owners of a Cuban plantation.  Meanwhile, the outcome of the case worries President Martin Van Buren, who is told he can have an influence and thereby help himself to be re-elected, and possibly even prevent civil war.One problem for the Africans:  none of them speak English, and at first, no one can be found who speaks their language.  A free black man who happens to belong to their tribe is found and serves as a translator.  During the testimony at the trial, we see flashbacks of the capture of Cinque and others, and of the brutal treatment they receive.Whether or not it was historically accurate, this movie was well made. For the first fifteen minutes, no one speaks English, and subtitles are used only when absolutely necessary.  We are challenged, but it makes the movie more realistic.  Plenty of actors give fine performances, especially Djimon Hounsou as Cinque, who comes across as dignified and serious when being mistreated, positively terrifying when he feels he must strike back, and reserved but pleasant when he knows people are helping him.  Cinque probably shows what Africans are really like and how we should have been treating them as humans worthy of respect.  Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances as well, quite eloquent as the former president of the United States who has a chance to make a difference.  Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman also do quite well.Believe it or not, there is comedy in this movie (and how could there not be, with Spielberg in charge?).  The Africans do not trust the white people who are on their side, and not being able to speak the language, they cannot tell what is going on.  So several of them accuse the people on their side of being no better than 'dung scrapers'.  Adams, on the other hand, falls asleep frequently in Congress, and he is accused of doing so in the movie. Adams, in fact, provides most of the funny lines.Some of the best scenes are the ones where Cinque and his translator finally make a connection and make clear the intentions of Baldwin and the others. The debates over the morality of slavery and about what should be done with the Africans appear to have been well-researched and well-written, though I don't know enough to say they are historically accurate.  The violent scenes on the slave ships appeared realistic and carefully done, in order to give us the right impression.  One thing I found curious:  African blacks are dark-skinned.  Most, if not all, of those pushed overboard were light-skinned, which would indicate some white ancestry.This is definitely a movie worth seeing for educational reasons, but it is not for the squeamish.  A person could, however, see a tape and fast-forward through the difficult parts and still be left with a worthwhile experience.******************SPOILERS*****************Adams did, in fact, finally agree to represent the Africans after the government appealed a verdict in the Africans' favor.  It was a real pleasure to watch the Africans celebrate their freedom, though later Cinque found it quite confusing how the American system of justice could work so strangely.  The conversations between Adams and Cinque, and later the eloquent speech by Adams before the Supreme Court, were among the movie's best moments.",Null,0,2,23 June 2003
Kickboxer," Entertaining enough
","So now I've finally seen all of the first three movies. I had 'Kickboxer' in my TiVo but chose to watch the sequel first. You can see why if you go to my review of that movie. And I saw the second sequel before this one as well.Did it help to see the second one first? Certain details were less of a shock. However, the brother in the other movies in the series did not exist or was unknown to the brothers in this movie. And something else was inconsistent between this movie and the sequel. But I can't say what that was because it would be a major spoiler. Let's just say I was dreading the ending of this movie but it was much more satisfying than I had thought it would be. A term used on the CW Smallville message boards was 'Offscreenville'. Perhaps something happened offscreen between the two movies. You watch Jean Claude Van Damme movies to see him fight. You do not watch them to see him act. He did smile a lot in some scenes with his brother. He almost never smiles. So here, he seems to have a more pleasant personality, at least in a few scenes, than what I am used to.Van Damme is shown as the director of fight scenes. I don't know precisely how you direct yourself, but Van Damme knows what he is doing. And all the fighting is really good.As was the case in the sequels, Dennis Chan does a very good job as trainer Xian. And there is a lot of comedy, though not nearly as much as in the third movie. The training here reminded me a lot of the training in the sequel: very tough, sometimes funny. Xian would not let Kurt give up.Haskell Anderson is quite good as the man who gives Kurt and Eric so much help.I'm not sure why Michel Qissi was shown in the credits as Tong Po, but whatever his real name is he is quite fierce without saying a word, and terrifying when he does speak the one time.Rochelle Asana is simply adorable as Xian's niece who ran the village store.I am curious about how Xian knew Kurt was American. Kurt's accent, of course, is explained when he says his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in Belgium and his father stayed with Eric in the U.S. Eric has an 'ethnic' look, though, which is never explained.Is this a good movie? Maybe. It's no 'Rocky', that's for sure. But it's not bad.",Null,0,0,9 May 2013
Rocky V," Not bad. Makes me want to see I, II, III and IV.
","Rocky Balboa has to retire from boxing because of brain damage from too many blows to the head.  Unfortunately, the man given the responsibility of handling Rocky's money has taken it all for himself.   This means Rocky, his wife and his son must move back to the old neighborhood.  Rocky is not happy about that, but his wife frequently reminds him that lots of people live the way they do now and it's nothing to be ashamed of.  Rocky's son starts at a tough school that his father attended, and he gets beat up by bullies.  The boy wants to learn to box like his father, but the boy's mother doesn't want him to fight.  Meanwhile, Rocky's only way to contend for a title is to manage an up-and-coming boxer named Tommy Gunn.  Rocky spends so much time with Gunn that his son feels ignored.  Sleazy promoter George Washington Duke sees the potential in Gunn and wants to take over the man's career. This would have made a good tv-movie, but it doesn't seem like it lives up to what I've heard about the popular series of films.  This is my first 'Rocky' movie, but the earlier films may have been better.  Most of the time Sylvester Stallone sounds like he is doing a comic impression of himself, though this could be because of the character's brain damage.  He sounds perfectly normal, though, in the scene where he takes his son to school for the first time.  The standout performance is given by Burgess Meredith in flashbacks, though these are probably from the earlier movies.",Null,5,8,31 December 2002
Ted," Entertaining and funny, beginning and end show substance
","The first few scenes of this movie give the impression of a wholesome, family-friendly Christmas movie. Okay, except for the part about beating up a kid because he's Jewish, but that still might have been acceptable in some family movies. Patrick Stewart's narration, like pretty much everything he does, is magnificent.Things change pretty quickly. I'm so glad I had the sanitized version aired on NBC, which I finally got around to watching yesterday.Okay, sanitized isn't quite right. Broadcast TV still allows a lot of filth.Still, I found the whole story quite entertaining, and a lot of it was funny.And while this could easily be dismissed as garbage, the last 30 minutes or so gave this movie some substance. An exciting adventure and some touching moments, and giving Lori the chance to show how caring she is.Lori is such a loving and patient girl, despite being so good-looking. Mila Kunis did a fine job. I mean for this type of material. This isn't 'Black Swan' (actually, I have yet to see that).John is an appealing enough character and very dedicated to his 'best friend'. I know Mark Wahlberg is capable of better, but he's good enough here.Seth MacFarlane gives his usual great performance, with one exception. He sounds like Peter Griffin (and this is mentioned), but occasionally, and the first time he talks, he sounds like Brian Griffin.Joel McHale showed considerably more talent on 'Community', but he has a couple of good scenes here as Lori's sleazy boss, and he's especially good delivering just one great line.I know Giovanni Ribisi is considered a respected actor, but I'm not sure what to say about him here. But without Donny and his son, this movie would have been missing some important scenes.Bill Smitrovich as Ted's boss does a good job, and has a surprising attitude.A cameo by Norah Jones shows her to be quite appealing, and of course I like her music.The music is one of the best things about the movie. Walter Murphy does the 50s sitcom-style music for 'Family Guy', and a lot of the music in this movie sounds similar. There is great music in fine restaurants and at Rex's party. There are exceptions: 1. The two versions of how John and Lori met.2. When John leaves one party for another, and when he arrives at the second party.3. Watching the TV series about Flash Gordon.4. Donny dances to Tiffany.Is this movie worth seeing? If you Seth MacFarlane's sitcoms, probably. And I do.",Null,1,2,21 March 2016
Spice World," Entertaining silly fun
","I've liked the Spice Girls for years, but I'm not sure why. Ordinarily, I don't care for their brand of dance-pop fluff, but somehow they make it sound good. Regardless of what anyone says, they are talented singers and dancers, and they show that numerous times. They're also pretty and most of them wear outfits that show a lot. And while they're not accomplished actresses, they are simply adorable.I don't think anyone intended this movie to be taken seriously. It's just good clean (well, slightly naughty) fun. Roger Moore comes the closest to giving a good performance, in a role that appears to be spoofing Bond villains. Just in case we don't get the joke, he pets a long-haired cat. One of the funniest scenes has the girls complaining about people thinking they fit the stereotypical image people have of them. Of course, Emma says this while on a swing in a three-year-old's fantasy world.The girls actually show they have intelligence. Or do they? I thought Melanie B was the one with brains. She's no better off than the others!Another humorous incident: Victoria can't make up her mind whether to wear the short black Gucci dress or the short black Gucci dress. Emma suggests she wear the short black Gucci dress. Problem solved! Of course, the girls are being harassed by the tabloids, whose top personnel are shown being evil.And then there are the guys pitching their idea for a Spice Girls movie. Some of what we see is supposedly their imagination. Including a Dukes of Hazzard style incident with a bus, which was done so cheaply it's obviously not real. In the closing credits, the girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves, not merely playing exaggerated versions of themselves. I've never seen communication with the movie audience quite like this! It's not for people looking for Shakespeare. But if you want to laugh and hear music that is bubbly and upbeat, this is pretty good.",Null,6,9,2 May 2006
Just Go with It," Just go with it!
","I like Adam Sandler movies. I like Jennifer Aniston romantic comedies. Or any movies she is in. I like movies where people try to deceive others.So you know I'm going to like this one! I have just one complaint. I had to use my brain too much. It's too hard to keep up with all the lies.But you know what they say. When you lie once, you have to tell ten times as many lies to cover up the first one. Here, one little white lie--okay, a big white lie--turns into many lies as new details have to be explained. Add in scheming kids who blackmail their fake Dad who has money, and a couple of unexpected developments, and the formula is complete chaos.Adam Sandler is not a pathetic loser here. Well, he sort of is. Despite being on of the top plastic surgeons in Los Angeles, he can't get out of this jam he is in without spending a ton of money. And is it worth it? Well, Brooklyn Decker is gorgeous. And she looks great in a bikini. Plus she shows up in a towel and you hope it's going to come off. And it does. From the back. Even though it was FX, which allowed G.D. and the middle finger, nothing more was visible than one would see on broadcast TV. But it was a treat for a brief time. I only wish I had known who she was. I feel like I knew her when, as a local TV news reporter did a feature on this wholesome girl next door who happened to be a famous swimsuit model. As an actress, she is pleasant and a little on the bubblehead side, but as a teacher, the character has to be halfway intelligent.But is the grass always greener on the other side? Don't people sometimes already have what they want without realizing it? Jennifer Aniston is also really good-looking despite her age. And she always has that great hair, regardless of the style. She even looks good with glasses. And what a body! I didn't know what to expect when she started taking off her clothes. And if you liked that, there's a hula scene which is a bonus.But it's not just how she looks. She nearly always plays these intelligent characters who roll their eyes at what they have to put up with. She's the same type character here. Very appealing, and willing to do whatever it takes. And she might just be rewarded. Well, the expensive clothes and other perks are at least part of the reward.I should mention that one scene that keeps this from being just a formula movie takes place between Devlin and Devlin (Yes, I have to say that her nemesis from college shows up--just as she uses the woman's name for Danny's fake wife). That's really all I can say. It's an unexpected situation and proof these characters can be more than stereotypes.Oh, yes, about Devlin. Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job with a perpetually happy but often nasty character.I don't know anything about Nick Swardson, and I'm still not quite sure who he is, but he somehow ended up in this mess torturing poor Katherine as her fake Eastern European boyfriend Dolph. I thought he was supposed to be Russian, but I'm not quite sure. Very over-the-top, when in character.And what cute kids. Maggie is quite a schemer herself, and very proper English as 'Kiki Dee'. Or is that Audrey Hepburn in 'My Fair Lady'? Very funny, regardless. Michael also manages to get what he wants in exchange for portraying 'Bart', though he didn't quite think it through. One of his fantasies was Hawaii, so naturally this dysfunctional group ends up there, with entirely new fake story lines to present to others.I've never been a fan of Dave Matthews, the singer or the actor. But the man who is both does a good job here as a pretentious inventor who expects the best of everything because, after all, he has money. And Devlin (the real one) just loves him.So, will everyone end up with who they should? All this scheming results in some important realizations. But the question is whether those will lead to what should take place.The result is a real winner.",Null,2,3,20 June 2013
Tangled," Well done, a little violent
","Mandy Moore does a great job here, and Rapunzel's every emotion is effectively communicated both by the animators and by Moore. Rapunzel is the perfect combination of sweet, funny, intelligent and strong. She totally convinces me that she loves her 'mother', even though her mother uses her for her power but is herself also very convincing in her loving attitude. Zachary Levi is very good as Flynn, and being a fan of 'Chuck', I wish I had known his name. But Flynn is funny and likable.It's amazing how much Rapunzel knows about the outside world, but there are books in her castle. One would think that as much as Gothel wants to 'protect' her, she wouldn't introduce her to so many concepts that the girl could use against her.For a Disney movie, this is a little on the violent side, especially when Rapunzel and Flynn visit a hangout with a lot of tough men. But even that scene is still more comic and fantasy than really dangerous. A PG rating is probably justified but nothing to really worry about.The story is interesting and gives Rapunzel many opportunities to show her intelligence and ability.It's a good adventure for the whole family, except maybe the youngest kids.",Null,1,4,13 December 2013
Full Metal Jacket," First half deserves Oscar; second half shows a different kind of war
","I had heard great things about this movie but didn't remember specific details until I saw it. I only saw it because WGN America is in my basic basic cable package which I have just to be able to watch what I should receive free with an antenna. And I happened to see a couple of interesting movies as I was looking carefully through the listings at Christmas.I know the G-rated version of Boot Camp from 'Gomer Pyle, USMC', which the drill sergeant here was familiar with. This was nothing like that. At first I assumed this man was unspeakably brutal, but one imdb reviewer said yes, he was in Boot Camp during the era when this was set, and this was realistic. I'm sorry to hear that. This treatment of human beings was nothing less than disturbing and upsetting. And entertaining because it was so well done. In fact, we could even laugh at times.LAUGH? YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY? Sir, no sir!'South Park' once tried to set a record for uses of the S-word in an episode. I believe this movie beats that record for the word itself and countless compound words that include it and then some. There were only a couple of words WGN America wouldn't allow.How could anyone treat people this way? Is this really going to produce confident fighters? For one man in particular, we saw the predictable result of treatment beyond what any human should endure. Yes, he will be a killing machine. But he is not the proud honorable warrior that the Marines are known for. More like a serial killer with a frightening expression on his face, a man we should be afraid to send to Vietnam.How did Lee Ermey not win an Oscar? Or at least get a nomination? And Vincent D'Onofrio should have at least been nominated as well. Called 'Gomer Pyle' because he is such an incompetent idiot, he is patiently trained by Joker, in a way that is more likely to get results. I remember the same thing happening to the original Gomer in his show's pilot, only that was done by his D.I. who was given the impression Gomer was a general's son sent to test him. In truth, this Gomer Pyle probably should have washed out, as the original Gomer's D.I. believed would happen in his case. But then we wouldn't have found that quite as entertaining. Or disturbing.And talk about disturbing. I began to realize what I thought I had heard. I don't know if I ever did, but that's what happened.And then the whole tone of the movie changes. We get to laugh a few more times before things get really serious. Things aren't too bad where combat is not taking place, but it's still not family-friendly by a long shot. And regardless of which side they are on, Vietnamese people are treated like dirt by the white and black soldiers (I'm not sure they are all Marines, and I think 'soldiers' may be an acceptable term for those in the service on land). After all, any of them could be the enemy.Finally, there is real combat. Wait, this is war? It's not the traditional image of war. It's more like war has been in the past couple of decades. In fact, it's like an episode of Lucas Till's 'MacGyver' but far more violent, and there's no science genius who can solve any problem and make anything out of whatever parts he can find.Someone is filming a documentary, which makes things interesting. We hear the opinions of those who are serving.Oscar worthy? Not really, not here. But like Boot Camp, it is quite disturbing. The enemy is prepared to kill or be killed. Some of those on our side have quite an unsettling attitude. When we finally meet the enemy, there are moral decisions to be made. The right thing is done, though is there anything right here at all?Vietnam. It wasn't pretty. Neither is this movie. If you can stand it, this is a worthwhile experience.",Null,1,1,18 February 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," Wonderful but too short
","I didn't see this movie until after I had seen four seasons of 'Ugly Betty', a great TV series that I enjoyed a lot. And with all the similarities between the two, I naturally found myself wanting more from this movie. On the TV series, it took the bumbling ingenue years to become indispensable. Here, it happened in just over an hour, commercials included. And I couldn't believe it was over so fast.I've liked Anne Hathaway for a long time, and she was charming, adorable and quite pretty. It took her a while to demonstrate intelligence and drive but she did it admirably. At the beginning of the movie I couldn't see anything so wrong with Andy, but then I thought she was cute and attractive and didn't understand what someone working in the fashion industry was supposed to look like. Later, with the proper clothes and hair she looked amazing. Andy wasn't quite as sweet and innocent as I would have expected; with her friends she could be a little on the edgy side. But overall I liked her a lot. It was a shame to see her having to deal with moral dilemmas late in the movie, but she did what she had to, and then she did what she should. Andy is a good person.Miranda was enjoyable and considerably less of a monster than one might expect. Though incredibly demanding throughout the movie, her evil persona mostly came from being relayed through Emily. Miranda seemed much more human when making the demands in person, though you get the impression one still expected to be punished severely for the least little offense. One effectively edited sequence showed Andy being harassed day after day after day, too fast for the viewer to really take in each individual action, but fast enough to convey Andy's misery. Mostly Miranda was throwing her coat on poor Andy's desk, but there was surely more to it.Later Miranda showed much more of a human side and even appeared vulnerable. The night after I saw this movie, Meryl Streep accepted only her third Oscar and made a point of mentioning the wonderful hair and makeup artist Roy Helland who had worked with her on all her films for years. He really did good work; I'm not sure how old Miranda was supposed to be but she looked attractive enough to be working in the fashion industry. But in one scene, the one where Miranda actually showed herself to be the most human, she looked like she belonged in a nursing home. Was Streep really that old or was it just more of Helland's work? Either way, very effective.Emily Blunt did a great job. I don't think we were supposed to like her, and I didn't in the sense of loving to hate her, but she made Andy's life miserable in an entertaining way, mostly by relaying Miranda's unreasonable expectations. But she didn't want Andy to succeed, so she made Andy figure things out more than she really helped her. Andy, forced to do things herself, eventually figured it out, and Emily ended up making us care about her.Stanley Tucci did a fine job as Nigel, Andy's biggest supporter. Now this is a character we were really supposed to like.I recognized 'The Mentalist' as the man with the potential to further Andy's desired career. I've never seen the show, but I sure did like him and found myself wishing I had watched his series.I didn't really like Nate. One wouldn't expect a cute girl like Andy to have such an edgy boyfriend. But she wasn't really all that cute, was she? I found myself rooting for Christian as Andy had to make a choice.Overall, it was a great effort, and the one weakness I observed was that it all happened too fast and we didn't really get to enjoy any single stage for all that long. Maybe a three-hour movie (commercials included) instead of two.",Null,1,2,28 February 2012
Rocky II," Pretty good, but until the second half, doesn't seem like the sequel to a classic
","At the beginning, Rocky Balboa has been badly beaten up by Apollo Creed. Both have been taken to the hospital.  Mickey thinks Rocky won the fight, and so do lots of fans.  But the judges said Apollo won, and Apollo wants a rematch.Once he is out of the hospital, Rocky marries Adrian and starts spending money he doesn't really have.  He tries doing commercials but he isn't much of an actor.  Rocky also gets a job in a meat-packing plant, while Adrian, who is pregnant, goes to work in a pet store. Rocky is not pleased that he can't support his family himself, so he considers returning to boxing, even though he risks going blind in one eye, and he could still get hurt simply because of being unable to see well from that eye.  Meanwhile, Apollo hasn't given up on his challenge.Before this movie I had only seen the fifth movie in the series.  I was beginning to think that one was going to be the better of the two, and surely this one wasn't going to come close to what I had heard about the original.  The second half definitely makes this movie work, though.  And Burgess Meredith and Carl Weathers gave good performances.  Sylvester Stallone is a better actor when he's not talking.  Throughout the whole movie he sounded like a comic impression of himself.  At least in V, he talked normally in one scene.I liked the funny parts, such as the commercials, and his talking to a tiger at the zoo when he proposed to Adrian.  The second half was more exciting and had some sad moments as well.  Did Rocky fight again?  More importantly, did he win?  The Rocky of the first half was a joke, and I thought the answer was going to be obvious.  Not true.This was a pretty good movie, and one of these days I have to see the original.",Null,0,1,7 September 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Adorable, funny, perfect voice casting for the lead roles
","I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.And the writing was so intelligent, this movie was not just for kids. There were a lot of clever jokes that kids might not get. Still, the warm and fuzzy qualities of so many of the monsters make this a perfect choice for kids as well as adults, and I really don't get why ABC couldn't give this a TV-G rating. It may have been a little violent or scary at times, but never all that intense. Kids see worse on Saturday morning.",Null,60,62,31 October 2004
Fargo," What was so great about this?
","If this was supposed to be a comedy, it was very dark.  And quite violent. At first, the only thing funny about it was the exaggerated Scandinavian accent everyone seemed to have.As time went on, the movie was funnier.  Mostly because of Frances McDormand.  As hard as I tried, as annoying as I found her character, I couldn't deny she gave a great comic performance.  And toward the end, she showed she had dramatic ability too.William H. Macy was pretty good, though sometimes I wondered what happened to his accent.Some comic highlights for me (hope none of these are ***SPOILERS*** , but they might be):-The scene where Marge and her partner first begin investigating a triple homicide -A cop interviews a man clearing his driveway-Two bimbos are interviewed in a bar-Jerry's conversations with the man from GMAC who doesn't believe the cars on which a loan was made really exist-Carl's partner ignores him even though Carl is covered with blood Overall, though, I had real problems with this movie.  If it had been a straight mystery or a straight comedy, it might have been better.  But it was too inconsistent.",Null,0,1,8 February 2004
Duck Soup," Groucho was great, Chico and Harpo good
","I'm too cheap for cable, or to rent or buy videos, but I was lucky to be in a motel with cable the night Buck Henry co-hosted a TCM presentation of his favorite films.As a young child I watched Groucho on 'You Bet Your Life', which I saw recently in reruns on a PBS station. I've always enjoyed his particular brand of humor. And in this movie he was fantastic. His combination of wit and rapid-fire delivery is rarely seen these days--Lauren Graham on 'Gilmore Girls' comes close, though her humor is different. Jim Carrey and Robin Williams have their own unique styles but they don't really match Groucho. If he wasn't ad-libbing--and it sure seemed like he was but that was apparently part of his talent--the writing was outstanding. The film was rated TV-G but came very close to being bawdy, though that's part of Groucho's charm. Yes, he got laughs by insulting people; Groucho and Don Rickles were masters of that. To me, both comedians are too easy to like for the insults to seem hurtful.Chico and Harpo were quite good too. Chico could have been a fine comic actor on his own, with a delivery that ALMOST matched that of his zany brother.At first I thought Harpo was every bit as talented as Tony Papenfuss and John Voldstad of 'Newhart', but later I realized I had that backwards. I finally saw how truly gifted Harpo was at facial expressions, and he made his character truly likable. Then there was the dispute with the lemonade vendor (including the trading of hats which I wasn't paying enough attention to), and of course the great mirror routine, which I had seen with Lucille Ball but didn't really appreciate.Most of the characters were not supposed to be funny, and it added to this movie's quality that these characters were done completely straight. I never even noticed who Zeppo was, and while all the actors seemed talented, he evidently didn't match his brothers' particular skills.This is definitely one of the great movies.",Null,0,0,23 June 2005
Rocky IV," Not a classic but still good at times
","I have now seen four of the first five 'Rocky' movies. I still have the third to go. But I can say that this was the least entertaining of the four so far. Not the worst, because it wasn't all bad.My favorite scene is the birthday party for Uncle Paulie. I like the warm family moments, especially when they are funny. And I like that robot that Rocky gives Uncle Paulie as a present. And I like Uncle Paulie and Rocky's son. Adrian is quite pretty. The actors playing all three do a good job.In second place, although I don't like boxing (which is why I've taken so long to see these movies), is watching Rocky persevere against Drago. I can't stand watching the guy get beat up so badly. How can anyone take so much punishment and still keep fighting? And yet he does. It's a pleasure to see him actually wear down Drago.Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance overall here. Sure, this isn't a classic, but it's not terrible. Carl Weathers is even better, though to me his reaction to Drago is overdone (part of that is writing). And certainly what happened to Apollo in the ring was too much. But it does give Rocky an incentive.Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki give good performances as well. As for Dolph Lundgren, he does an amazing job of just looking tough and fierce, but for the most part Drago shows no emotion. In one exciting sequence where he and Rocky are both shown training in separate locations, he does show some determination. And toward the end of his fight with Rocky, Drago no longer appears to be a robot. I wouldn't call that good acting, though.For those who started with this movie, that would be unfortunate because you're not seeing how good the others are. But there are flashbacks at one point, with music but no sound, to help explain what has happened.The music in this movie is certainly not my taste. The familiar theme from the first two movies is not in it, to my knowledge, though the Survivor theme from the third movie is pretty good. Most of the rest of the songs, as opposed to background music, sound like garbage to me. James Brown's performance in the typical Vegas introduction to the first fight shows 'He's still got it' as of the making of this movie, but it's still not the sort of thing I like. Wayne Newton, Frank Sinatra, or any number of Vegas-style musicians would have pleased me more.There is some beautiful scenery in Russia (actually Canada).Anyway, if you enjoyed the other movies, you might consider this a letdown, or you might enjoy this more because some of what made the others good is here.",Null,0,1,15 March 2007
The Fast and the Furious," Wow!
","I first became aware of this movie when the first annual Taurus awards for stunts aired.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this one was really something.  Not only fantastic stunt driving around 18-wheelers, but one female character actually drove UNDER a tractor-trailer!  Add to the stunts the great editing and amazing camera work.  Not to mention visual effects.  And just before the street racing, I thought they showed the equipment in the cars quite effectively.  One more thing:  in one of the race scenes, which wasn't an event with spectators, these two guys tried to beat a train!  And one didn't seem to think life was worth living so anything could have happened.  It was something to watch.Still, the music was too loud, there was more violence than I care for, and there wasn't much to the plot.  At least I saw a version with the language cleaned up. But I felt there was good acting.  For this kind of movie, anyway.  Vin Diesel may not have been Oscar caliber here, but he showed potential, especially when talking about what happened to his father and how it changed his life.  Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker were pretty good too. Ja Rule wasn't bad.This was one to keep me on the edge of my seat.  I don't watch a lot of movies like these, but this was definitely one to see.",Null,0,1,25 February 2004
Mamma Mia!," Funny and enjoyable even without the music
","I liked the music of ABBA in the 1970s. Or rather, I liked the familiar music of ABBA. This movie features a lot of songs I never heard and for the most part don't like. But part of the appeal of ABBA songs is those beautiful voices. An added bonus, as I found out after Dick Clark died and ABC showed a New Year's Eve special with the best moments from New Year's Eves past, is seeing those good-looking girls perform.This movie had a perfectly good plot without the songs. I liked the mystery of who Sophie's father is. I liked all the comedy and seeing Meryl Streep not take herself too seriously. The film was especially funny when each potential Dad realized he must be Sophie's Dad.The songs do add something. Some of them have dancing that is fun to watch. And Streep gets to be even more silly. Plus she's quite flexible, but that's nothing compared to Christine Baranski, who apparently can move like a circus performer.The natives seemed real enough. I'm referring to the people who didn't seem American or British who apparently had always lived wherever this movie took place.I don't even remember the names of the potential fathers, but they all did a good job. Particularly the one with the boat. Pierce Brosnan was my favorite of the three, and he could even sing. Well, he had the talent that George Burns has for singing. In other words, not really singing talent, but you like him enough you don't care. Sadly, I saw the movie 'Evelyn' around the same time I saw this, and he sang in that too. He wasn't any better and yet his character was trying to make a living.I could have done without the wild rock concert at the end. Surely Streep has more dignity than that. And yet she is so respected even that couldn't hurt her reputation, and she seemed to be enjoying it. I'm sure many others will.It's a worthy effort.Sophie looks good in a swimsuit.",Null,1,1,13 September 2013
Remember the Titans," Good job by everyone, especially Denzel Washington; exciting and inspirational
","At the beginning and the end of the movie (but not in between), Sheryl as an adult is narrating.  A funeral is taking place in the early 1980s. Then the movie goes back to 1971, where people in the Washington, D. C., suburb of Alexandria are rioting because a white business owner has killed a black teenager.  If that's not bad enough, two of the schools have been combined to form the city's first integrated high school and the people are very upset about that.  Coach Yoast, who has been very successful in the football program at the white school, does not like having Herman Boone, who is black, hired as an assistant coach. Unfortunately, things get worse. Coach Boone is named the head football coach because the area has no black head coaches.  The white players do not want to play for anyone except Coach Yoast.  Unfortunately, if they don't play where they are assigned, they don't play without paying a lot of money to go somewhere else. Eventually, the nearly all-black football team gets its white players back, and Coach Yoast returns as an assistant.Coach Boone runs training camp like boot camp.  He expects nothing less than perfection, and he expects the players to get along despite their racial differences. Eventually, the team must return to the 'real world', where the people need lessons in tolerance.  It's an exciting football season, and the team has its ups and downs.  When I saw it, this was a 'Wonderful World of Disney' movie (with additional footage not shown in theaters or even on DVD), though not as clean as most, and you pretty much know what to expect. This movie is based on a real story, though, so you don't know exactly how the Disney formula will work in this case.Denzel Washington did a wonderful job.  His character showed no fear and stood up to all obstacles that came his way. Yet he still managed to show a tender side when it was appropriate.  Hayden Panettiere gave the other standout performance, as Coach Yoast's 9-year-old daughter Sheryl, who knew almost as much as her father about football.  I thought pretty much everyone gave a good performance.  The movie was a little on the long side, and it did contain some offensive terms used by those who hate people just because of their race.  There were also a couple of suggestions of homosexuality. However, there was little violence except on the football field.  And even there, it was mostly the usual for football.There was some comedy.  In addition to Sheryl's precocious behavior, there were lots of great moments where players were learning about each other. Such as when one black player was forced to listen to Buck Owens.
This movie showed a football team and a town that had more than the usual obstacles to overcome, and in many ways the people in this movie showed us all that some things can be done which seem impossible.",Null,0,1,28 September 2003
2012," Don't expect much, but just enjoy watching the world destroyed
","I didn't remember what I had heard about this movie, but I knew from the TV listings that this was a movie about the Mayan prediction that the world would end December 21, 2012. There is the obligatory expert trying to convince those that can do something that this is a big deal. And the something they can do is prepare. This cannot be stopped. But as in the case of 'The Day After Tomorrow', once it starts and cannot be stopped, it's happening too fast for anyone but a select few to survive.And only wackos will believe it's happening. One in particular is a major focus of this movie. He is the standout performer by far, and not once before I saw the closing credits did I imagine this would be Woody Harrelson. He has too much hair to be recognizable, but still--this guy is good! With some sort of low-budget connection with the world to get his message out, he has a few followers. And he takes risks. When will he ever get another chance to see such calamity? Danny Glover as the President gives a dignified and authoritative performance that made me think of Sidney Poitier. I knew he wasn't old enough and didn't look quite like the man.Another standout performer is the quiet Tibetan holy man.And of course the visual effects are nothing less than fantastic, if you had the ability to advance one frame at a time, which I didn't. It all happened too fast. And miraculously, almost every disaster happens in such a way that a main character or characters escaped JUST IN TIME! Yes, I said every disaster. This is not one disaster. This is many disasters, all over the world, happening in just a matter of days. Pick almost any world landmark (okay, that's an exaggeration--they picked about a dozen or so) and you can watch it crumble.And then of course there are the people. Not a lot of quality performances, but a bad Lifetime movie where it just happens the world is ending. That's fine for me. I like having this dysfunctional family as a focus. A scared 7-year-old girl who is actually quite resilient. Her slightly older brother who resents that his father is no longer around, even though circumstances have sort of reunited the family. A pretty mom with an attitude. And a rich doctor whose contributions will prove invaluable. And let's not forget Dad, the hero of the whole picture--who knows how many lives he saves?You have to look at this film with a sense of humor. For example, the couple in the supermarket is growing apart. And then, the floor cracks open and separates them--literally--and swallows the food on the shelves. Way too fast for me.Let's not forget the obligatory speech toward the end by our other hero--the man who tried to warn everyone in positions of authority (as opposed to ordinary people, who the Glenn Beck of Yellowstone wanted to reach) but was pretty much ignored. Toward the end, he has to quickly change attitudes before the end of the world becomes something much worse (Worse? Really? Yes.). It's a corny but great moment.This just keeps growing and growing. Just when you think it can't get any more complicated, it does. The end is very exciting, with deadlines that can't be moved, actions that have to be taken fast, with possible deadly consequences for those who do (but thousands more will die otherwise), arguments between world leaders, ethical dilemmas--you can't say it's not a thrill ride. Whether it's actually good--who cares? It's kind of scary watching everything blowing up, disappearing, thousands of unseen people surely dying, but you knew that coming in, right? Just go with it.",Null,1,2,20 June 2013
Annie Hall," I was glad when this was over
","I guess I'm not the type who likes Woody Allen films. While I loved 'Don't Drink the Water' and I liked 'The Sunshine Boys', I found 'Scenes from a Mall' to be a disappointment. I don't remember exactly how I felt about 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Alice', but I don't recall liking either one a lot.So my expectations were not that high for this movie. I really enjoyed the surreal scenes, such as when the adult Alvy appeared in the classroom where he was a child, especially when the kids started saying some very adult things. The scene with the wicked queen from 'Snow White' was great and, if it was new animation, rather than just inserting characters into the old, it was perfect. I liked some of Alvy's jokes, but by no means all. And while some of the humor may have been cutting edge way back then, it's not my taste and I've heard it too many times before. I like old corny jokes told well.I'm sure Diane Keaton did a good job. Annie Hall just didn't appeal to me as a character, and she wasn't that pretty, though I liked her hair and she had a nice smile. I liked the outfit that included the tie her grandmother gave her.It surprised me that Alvy left a party to watch a Knicks game. I just don't think of Woody Allen, or his characters, as sports fans. I don't like sports myself.I was confused several times because Alvy seemed to know Annie well at first, then it was like they had just met in some later scenes, and this was never explained.Something I found curious, which indicates there could be strong language here: the TV station included a stern warning about adult content because this was not edited. And yet the sound went out a couple of times. I don't know what I didn't hear, but I suspect it was bad.I'm not saying I can't like this kind of humor. It's just that this wasn't my kind of movie.",Null,1,6,22 March 2005
Life Is Beautiful," Benigni a delight as Guido
","I'll always remember Roberto Benigni for the way he climbed over chairs to get to the stage at the Oscars. I couldn't imagine how a film about the Holocaust could include such a clown. But it makes perfect sense now. He was a clown before he and Joshua went to the concentration camp. And after he got there, his only concern was protecting Joshua from the reality. If 'Stalag 17' and 'Hogan's Heroes' can make fun of German POWs, why not a comedy about concentration camps? 'Stalag 17' didn't completely ignore the seriousness of the situation. 'M*A*S*H' is THE classic example of making light of something as serious as war in order to cope.Guido was so funny every time he explained the game to Joshua. And when he 'translated' from German. Brilliant writing there! Yes, the others knew he was making it up. I could tell from their faces.Even when Joshua heard other children had died, this clever man would not give up. From time to time, Guido was shown facing the seriousness of his situation. Such as when he was ready to give up because he couldn't carry any more anvils. No, if it meant death, he would persevere! And still he showed his comic side, even then. I do wish he hadn't acted like such a clown even in that scene, simply because he wasn't quite convincing as a real person. But he was so entertaining, what did it matter? And he was serious enough when he had to be, when Joshua couldn't see it.Every once in a while the concentration camp scenes took a dark turn. This was necessary, since we shouldn't ignore the tragedy.The ending really affected me, but it wasn't all bad. The sad part was a necessity to show us this wasn't a joke.",Null,3,6,12 December 2006
The Hurricane," Inspiring but also depressing fact-based story; well-done, especially Washington's performance (SPOILERS)
","The movie begins with a 1963 boxing match, filmed in black and white, involving Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter.  Then we see a scene from 1973, in color, where Carter is worried the manuscript from his book will be taken away, but a compassionate guard tries to assure Carter that doesn't have to happen.  After we go back and forth between the two settings for a while, it is 1966 and we see the murders for which Carter was convicted, but we can't see who committed them.  Outside after the murders, we are unable to see any more than one of the witnesses does.Then it is the 1980s and Lesra, a troubled black teenager, has moved in with Lisa, Sam and Terry, who are white and want to help him make his life better.  They met when Lesra was working for the EPA, and after finding out Lesra didn't know how to read, they want to teach Lesra to read.  One of his first books is Carter's autobiography.  As Lesra reads, Denzel Washington narrates, and we see Carter's life in flashbacks, starting when he was young and got in big trouble for the first time.  According to the movie, Carter was merely defending himself from a pedophile, though the police did not believe him, since the man was one of the city's leading citizens.  Though we don't get to see any of the time he spent there, Carter is sentenced to a juvenile detention facility. Later, Carter is home while serving in the military, wearing his uniform. He has cleaned up his life and vowed to improve himself mentally and physically.  But even then, he can't stay out of trouble.Some of the scenes relating to the murders are shown again, along with new ones.  Apparently one of the people who said Carter committed the murders was trying to get out of trouble.  And one of the cops remembered him from before and just had it in for Carter.Once in prison, Carter thinks he can go against the rules.  The warden won't hear of it.  Carter takes everything that is thrown at him, but one guard thinks he can give Carter special treatment and get Carter to stop behaving in a way that could kill him.The flashbacks stop for the most part (if they don't get confusing enough, Lisa also picks up the book and Washington starts narrating).  Lesra starts a pen-pal relationship with Carter that eventually leads to visits.  Lesra and his friends believe they can help Carter get out of prison, but so far his many attempts to appeal have failed.Washington gives a wonderful performance.  He is positively terrifying in the boxing ring and during his angry episodes as a prisoner.  Most of the time he comes across as dignified, intelligent, and somewhat bitter but not chronically angry.  He can also be vulnerable and even sad, and borderline insane.  And of course Washington does happy very well, something we don't get to see enough of since Carter didn't have many reasons to be happy.  His Oscar nomination was certainly deserved.Vicellous Reon Shannon also does a good job as Lesra, and Deborah Unger plays Lisa well, especially in the second half.  Al Waxman commands respect as the warden, and Clancy Brown is quite likeable as the guard who treated Carter like a human being.Lesra is inspired to make something of himself as he gets to know Carter, and in this way I suppose it was valuable to learn about Carter the way he did.  We are also inspired by Carter's struggle, but we get let down a lot.I have two major complaints about the movie:  Mae Thelma obviously cared a lot for Carter, judging from her reaction to his conviction, but we never saw his relationship with her develop, and we heard little from her throughout the rest of the movie.  Also, the constant flashbacks at the beginning were quite confusing, as we went back and forth from one time period to another.  The flashbacks came back later in the movie, but they were necessary to illustrate the process of appealing Carter's case. The boxing scenes also appeared well done, though I'm no boxing fan. Overall, I found this movie very worthwhile and entertaining, especially toward the end.*********************SPOILERS********************Lesra and his friends moved to be near Carter and help with his appeal.  The efforts that have failed over many years suddenly shift into high gear, and it's quite exciting to watch the process of finding out the truth.  A risky strategy takes the case into federal court, and Rod Steiger gives an impressive performance as the judge.  It is a case of all or nothing.  This makes the ending a real joy to watch. In case you don't know, Carter did get out of prison.  I only say this because it's probably well-known.",Null,0,2,7 July 2003
Rocky," well done, but not really my kind of movie
","Now I have finally seen the original.  Having seen II and V, I would definitely say this is the best of the three, though I didn't find it all that entertaining a lot of the time.  Here, Rocky doesn't seem like a loser, though the truth is that he is just a regular guy who is having trouble making it in the world.  He doesn't talk like he is brain-damaged nearly as much as he did in the other two movies, and when he does sound like a comic impression, it's not really that bad.  Sylvester Stallone's performance in this movie is more multi-dimensional compared to II and V.Carl Weathers did a great job as the heavyweight champion who, for a gimmick, decided to fight an underdog.  And Burgess Meredith was quite good as the caring but sometimes nasty Mickey, who wanted to be Rocky's manager.  There was not as much comedy in this movie as there was in II, but I liked the scene with Rocky and Adrian at the skating rink, and there was another scene in a meat storage facility where his friend Paulie worked, where Rocky demonstrated one of his training techniques for a TV camera--punching carcasses.The arrangements of the theme song 'Gonna Fly Now' sounded better here than in II.  There was even one song at Rocky's apartment, which was played while he and Adrian were together, which sounded like it could have been the basis for 'Gonna Fly Now'. Or perhaps based on that theme song.Of course, as in II, most of the excitement came toward the end, and the shots of Rocky training as well as running through Philadelphia were quite effective. I can see why this movie was thought of as a classic.  It was good, but for me it wasn't great.",Null,0,1,14 September 2003
Rocky III," Good enough
","Now I have seen all five of the first five in the series.We were fooled this time. It sounded like 'Gonna Fly Now' would be played at the beginning, but it was just a song that sounded like that one. The new, almost equally worthy theme started up after that, with scenes from the life of Rocky Balboa (even 'The Muppet Show'!) as well as highlights of the career of Clubber Lang. Survivor's theme was used for some training scenes later and, with a tiger growling, for the closing credits. Purists who wanted 'Gonna Fly Now' get to hear it during some quite exciting training scenes, and played by a marching band early in the movie as Rocky's statue is unveiled.Was it as good as the others? Certainly none of the sequels matched the original, but this film held its own. For the first time, Rocky is faced with the prospect of actually having to retire. Clubber Lang is the fiercest, cruelest opponent yet. And, of course, with Mickey opposed to Rocky fighting this monster (and for another reason I'd rather not mention), Apollo Creed does the training this time, and Carl Weathers gives the movie's standout performance. In fact, this may have been the best of the movies for those who like him.The usual formula applies: need it be mentioned that Rocky can't win the first time? Or can he? Maybe Lang wants revenge. Can Rocky win the second time? Maybe.I'm not sure whether to call Mr. T a good actor. But he is definitely scary and menacing, always taunting, always acting like he can't be defeated. He just doesn't show a lot of range. And Muhammad Ali he's not--Ali had a kind side. One has to wonder if Lang ever had anyone care about him.Stallone gives a good performance here. He has to show doubt about whether he can continue. He certainly shows determination, and in some scenes where he should show fear, he doesn't. That is probably a good thing.Burgess Meredith is almost as good here as in the others, but he isn't in the movie much. Talia Shire has her share of good scenes too.Hulk Hogan is almost as menacing as T in the charity event, and one wonders how Rocky got out of that alive. Hogan's no actor, but his performance should satisfy fans of 'rasslin'. For those concerned that scene is too violent, Rocky's son does ask if Daddy is having fun. That should resolve any concerns.As for later, I guess it's up to parents if they want to watch two guys beating the you-know-what out of each other. That was never my favorite part of these movies.It's good enough to be part of the series.",Null,0,2,26 July 2007
A Beautiful Mind," Brilliant job, especially by Crowe
","I saw a Russell Crowe movie this afternoon (one that he'd probably like to forget) and was reminded I never got around to commenting on this stellar work of art. I wouldn't know Crowe from Adam, but that helped because he BECAME the character John Nash for me. This might have been harder with an actor who was familiar to me.I can identify with a man who was intelligent but had trouble fitting in socially in college. I was not brilliant and could have never achieved all that he did, but I have some understanding of this man's character. I thought the actor playing John's college roommate did a great job--especially later. And his little girl was adorable. Jennifer Connolly showed a lot of determination as Nash's wife, who had to deal with more than many spouses who give up. But she didn't.SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!!!!!!!But I found this movie very strange. I had heard that this was a man who had schizophrenia, but he seemed fairly normal. Anyone would be driven crazy by the type of work Nash was doing for the government, by the paranoia that resulted from the Soviet attempts to dominate the world, and our need to be ever vigilant. He had to see everything--and I mean everything--that could possibly indicate an attack was coming. Who wouldn't go crazy, with all this information to analyze and the remarkable ability to see patterns in everything? Only ... IT WASN'T TRUE. I was very surprised to learn the secret government work was his imagination, and that he never had a roommate. I might have watched the movie in a different way, if only I had known. And Nash's recovery was nothing short of amazing. Of course he went through the same ups and downs that most people would with this sort of illness. But he was determined to lick it, and he even learned to ignore his old college roommate and the man's imaginary daughter who were constantly following him. That part was really something to see.Too bad it was finally Denzel Washington's year. But I have yet to see 'Training Day', so who knows? Crowe's will be a hard performance to beat.",Null,0,2,12 September 2004
Ray," Excellent, especially Foxx
","At first, I thought Jamie Foxx was just the best out of an outstanding cast. But it soon became clear that there were going to be four men who were going to lose on Oscar night no matter how good they were. I've seen two of those four so far, and Foxx is definitely the best.That wasn't Jamie Foxx up there on the screen. That WAS Ray Charles. His smile, his speaking voice, his style of talking, his style of walking, his sense of humor, his passion for singing (even if it was the real Ray's voice, Foxx lip-synched very well), the way he played the piano (or perhaps Foxx only pretended, but if so he faked it very effectively). And Foxx also effectively captured Ray's intelligence and love for his family, though he had a strange way of showing that love. Foxx met one other set of challenges as he gave us the troubled Ray who experienced delusions and eventually endured the horrors of drug addiction.But Foxx was one of many talented performers in this movie. I want to single out a couple who weren't necessarily the best, but they stood out in my mind. Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother, shows a lot of determination as she strives to make sure that Ray won't end up like her--or once the boy starts going blind, even worse off than she is. It's an amazing thing to watch, especially in the first scene where the boy really seems to be blind. It can't be easy watching your son suffer, but you expect to be rewarded. All we see in the way of satisfaction for her is her pleasure at Ray's first signs of progress, though Ray does have a dream where she and George are alive and he can see, which makes it appear that she was actually proud of how her son turned out.Another actor who stood out in my mind was the one playing the man who introduced Ray all around the country and even in other countries, in various languages. He just did such a wonderful job. I think the character's name was Joe, so that would be Harry Lennix.Also, Terrone Bell (as Ray's brother George) seemed like a real five-year-old, not Hollywood's version.The music was excellent, and not just the performances but everything that happened behind the scenes. And we get to see just why the female vocalist on 'Hit the Road, Jack' did such an effective job--if the preceding scene was actually true.I would have been happier with a straight chronological story rather than flashbacks, but the way Ray's childhood was shown works.I didn't see any particular weaknesses. There's a lot of unpleasantness, but this was Ray Charles' life and that part has to be shown.One omission that I found curious: The Ray Charles Singers (various groups put together by Charles Raymond Offenberg) had several hits in the 1960s. When Ray Robinson started calling himself Ray Charles, Offenberg had been using the name for several years, and no one in the movie seemed to know this. And there was not one mention of those other Ray Charles Singers--Ray Robinson's backup group was called the Raelettes.Normally a three-hour movie (commercials included) is too long. But I wasn't ready for this one to be over.",Null,1,2,20 September 2007
The Waterboy," It's an Adam Sandler movie (fortunately, I like the guy)
","Bobby Boucher is fired from his job as waterboy for the UL football team after 18 years.  He has to return home to his mother deep in the Louisiana woods, where he and his mother share a house with a donkey who drinks out of the toilet.  His mother is so happy to have Bobby home, but Bobby would like to be working.  Eventually, he finds a group desperate enough to take him--the SCLSU football team, which has a 40-game losing streak, a pathetic loser of a coach, and one assistant coach who wears overalls  (always with one strap broken) and speaks what sounds like gibberish but could be Cajun.Bobby gets little respect from the players at first, and though he's used to being taunted, something finally snaps and he tackles one of the players. Coach Klein is so impressed that he talks Bobby into playing for the team, though Bobby doesn't believe his mother will let him.  The coach visits the Boucher house for a meal where the main course is snake, and when he asks what's for dessert, a blue flash comes from outside and the answer is 'Squirrel'.Mama Boucher will not let her son play 'foozball' (like just about everything else, it is of the devil), but the coach figures what she doesn't know won't hurt her.  Bobby has a number of challenges, including the fact that to play he must go to class.  While we don't see much of that, Bobby does manage to make a fool of himself, and he forgets he's only supposed to tackle football players.  Bobby also doesn't know much about football. Eventually, though, he proves to be everything the team needs to succeed. He also gets romantically involved with a beautiful ex-convict named Vicki (Mama doesn't approve, naturally).In all of the Adam Sandler movies I have seen except 'The Wedding Singer', Sandler has played a likeable loser with a temper who has obstacles to overcome, and I enjoy watching these Sandler characters.  The only difference with this movie is that he has a Cajun accent and he stutters. Sandler's temper, though, is less pronounced here and he has to be pushed into getting mad.  This movie makes good use of 'morphing', or turning people Bobby is supposed to tackle into someone he is mad at.In addition to Sandler, Kathy Bates gives a good performance, especially in the second half.  Jerry Reed is good as Bobby's former coach, except toward the end when he turns into a cartoon character. The sportscasters covering the Bobby Boucher story are convincing for the most part, but they turn silly by movie's end.  I also enjoyed two ignorant fans that stood out from the crowd, the coach with the language problem, and the SCLSU football player with the number 51 whose name I don't recall hearing.The music, while not my taste, is definitely above average for this type of movie.  The mix includes Southern rock, Americana, and something that sounds like reggae but could be popular in Louisiana.  There's also party music which has nothing to do with the rest of the styles, but the college students like it.Yes, it's silly, and not particularly realistic.  The ending was exciting but could never happen in real life.  But it was a funny, feel-good movie anyway.",Null,0,1,19 May 2003
The Blind Side," Great job, especially Bullock
","Even before this movie, Sandra Bullock was one of my favorite actresses. And not just because she is gorgeous. She looks good enough with dark hair, but being a blonde (as Leigh Anne is) doesn't make her prettier despite what most people say about blondes. She does look good enough for me to wonder if Faith got jealous, but there's much more to her here of course.I have to disagree that Bullock was the obvious choice for best actress on all the awards shows, but she certainly deserved a nomination. Some of her best moments include teaching Michael how to play football and putting Alton from the 'hood in his place. Leigh Anne is a force to be reckoned with, and she has a sarcastic sense of humor. Of course there was more to this movie than just Bullock's performance. It's an inspiring story overall, and Quinton Aaron is a wonderful gentle giant, easy to like, friendly and intelligent with a sense of humor. For someone who has been through all he has, Michael has such a good attitude.Jae Head does a great job for such a young actor. Michael's 'little brother' is quite a standout.Tim McGraw doesn't remind me at all of the country singer. He holds his own against a strong, intelligent wife, and he's easy to like, but he knows his place.Someone else who deserves a mention: Eric Benson, #66 on the first team Michael played against. He intends to make Michael's life miserable and found out Michael was a giant creampuff. The taunts never ended until Michael learned just how deal with him, and how he did it was memorable and humorous. Michael's teachers are quite patient with him. He just needs to be taught in the way he could learn. There are lots of good performances among the Wingate faculty.Kathy Bates does a good job as Michael's tutor, but except for her horror story about the Knoxville stadium, I have to say she did slightly better in the other movie I saw her in on the same day--a humorous version of the Jesse James story.There are issues this movie hints at but doesn't deal with fully. Michael grew up in the 'hood and has an African-American heritage, and the issue of racism is touched on briefly, but there's not a lot of real conflict. Leigh Anne's friends make some insensitive comments, but they can easily be forgiven. They do have a lesson to learn.I was surprised at the TV-14 rating ABC gave this. Only a couple of violent scenes in the 'hood would be worthy of this. This is actually a family movie. Though Michael's old friends have such dirty mouths, and one word generally edited out of movies before broadcast is not in this case. While Michael has such a calm attitude, he can only be pushed so far.The obvious Oscar winner? I don't think so, but it was well worth seeing.",Null,0,1,30 April 2012
The Iron Giant," What seems big and evil may not be (SPOILERS)
","This movie is set in an era when the Soviet Union was seen as the evil empire, the greatest threat to our way of life.  But at the same time, our government's efforts to stop communism made it an enemy to anyone who seemed the least bit sympathetic to the Soviets or other horrible outside forces. In fact, we now know the Russians were probably no more evil than we were. And that was the case with the alien monster who landed in this world, in a small coastal community.  People saw the UFO, and it was reported to the feds. The government sent a bumbling agent with all the personality of a Las Vegas lounge singer, who could comically fake sincerity and a helpful attitude, or sternly remind uncooperative adversaries just who they were dealing with.  The one witness who actually saw the monster, a young boy, saved the monster as it tried to eat electrical transmission towers and a substation.  He did something a child should never do:  walked into the substation and turned off the power.  From there he and the monster became friends, and he received help from a beatnik junk dealer/artist who also became a potential romantic interest for the boy's single mother. Naturally, the boy has a hard time convincing people that what he saw was real, and when the federal agent shows up, he tries to cover up what he knows.  It's a nice story with lots of trivia that requires paying close attention, and the animation is incredibly detailed.  Spoilers follow:  The townspeople want to destroy the monster once they find out about him, and when conventional weapons do not work, the military tries a nuclear solution.  In this way, the movie parallels our real experience with the Russians:  if we used a nuclear weapon, we could end up destroying ourselves.  To their horror, the townspeople learned that by killing the monster, they would kill themselves and do away with their town.  It would have been too late, except for one final heroic act by the monster.  MAJOR SPOILER:  Or was it the monster's final act?  Despite the bomb's being nuclear, we see a hint early in the movie of just how there could be a truly happy ending.",Null,0,0,2 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," I don't like football. I liked this movie.
","As the movie starts, the fictional Miami Sharks are playing a professional football game.  I could feel the players hitting each other, and my TV is only 13 inches; that's good filmmaking.  Two quarterbacks get injured and the task of leading the offense falls to Willie Beamen, who seems pretty pathetic.  The team has already lost several games, and the outcome of this one appears inevitable.  Not so; Beamen is more than capable, and if not for a last-second touchdown by the other team, the Sharks would have won. Beamen becomes a national celebrity as the Sharks win one game after another.  However, the first-string quarterback, a real leader, will come back sooner or later, and Beamen has to accept this fact.  He is reminded that he is winning games, but he is not a leader and doesn't play by the rules.Lots of good acting performances here.  Cameron Diaz is the pretty, occasionally sweet, but often tough daughter of the deceased former owner; unlike her father, she wants to have a say in the decisions of head coach Tony D'Amato (which doesn't make the coach happy), and she intends to sell the team and possibly move it to Los Angeles (now this IS fiction:  in the movie, Los Angeles already has a pro football team). Jamie Foxx is surprisingly good as Beamen; I thought of him as a silly comic actor, but he comes across well in the dramatic scenes, still managing to be quite funny at other times.  I wasn't too pleased with one scene that suggested he was abusive to his girlfriend (which he never was), but the character was mostly easygoing off the field.  James Woods did well as a team doctor with questionable ethics; he seemed to care more about who played than about sound medical judgment.  Charlton Heston had a pleasant cameo appearance. And of course, if anyone could inspire these losers to become winners, it was Al Pacino as D'Amato, giving a strong performance, especially in the locker room where he really got the players fired up.  The sportscasters were very professional-sounding too.The music was mostly loud, but there was something for nearly every taste, including what I believe was a Native American performance. Unusual editing meant people would not likely get bored even in slow scenes; in Coach D'Amato's apartment, as the coach and Beamen talked about how Beamen could improve, there was constant switching back and forth between the two men talking and a Roman Empire gladiator-type movie the coach was apparently watching when Beamen arrived.  And there must have been a ton of profanity; sometimes I felt like I was watching a Hong Kong action film.This was not for people who like their entertainment quiet, but it was a change of pace for me.  A good job overall.",Null,0,1,10 January 2003
Before Sunrise," Borrring
","The scenery was beautiful as the train moved across Europe.  I sort of liked the classical music that was playing.  The train crossed a nice bridge, but unfortunately soon after that we had to find out what was going on inside the train.  Jesse and Celine met, and while the actors did a good job playing them and the characters were likeable and sometimes funny, I found myself more interested in what was outside the window of the train.The two main characters got off the train in Vienna.  It's a beautiful city, with lots of elegant, classic buildings.  And from high above the city at one point, we could see lots of trees.  We also got to see the inside of a magnificent church. The couple crossed another nice-looking bridge and, finally, I thought the movie was about to get good. Jesse and Celine met two actors who were really funny right from the start, and quite appealing.  But we never saw those two again.  The best part of the movie for me was the amusement park.  Not that there was much to that, but the couple danced (for all of maybe ten seconds) to Boots Randolph's 'Yakety Sax' in front of a game that I believe said 'Punch Belly' with a funny-looking man painted on it.  There were several scenes with guitar-based folk music or folk rock that didn't do much for me.  I wanted the classical music back.  Or Boots Randolph.Some people might enjoy the quirky characters, such as a fortune teller, or the poet who didn't beg for money but offered to write a poem based on a word he was given in exchange for whatever the recipient felt it was worth (He had probably already written the poem).   I can see people enjoying a movie like this.  It just wasn't for me.",Null,1,7,28 September 2003
Identity," Confusing but mostly satisfying
","At the start of the movie, Dr. Malick is evaluating Malcolm Rivers, who is about to be executed for a series of murders, unless Malick can convince those who need to hear that Rivers was insane.Then a seemingly unrelated series of events take place. And while we don't see Malick or Rivers again for a while, they are somehow connected with these events too. Exactly how I've never quite figured out.The one common thread is that all the parties involved (except Malick) are driving through rural Nevada in heavy rain that is causing so much flooding everyone will end up at this one motel. A hooker who wants to grow oranges in Florida, the spoiled actress Carolina Suzanne and her driver Ed, the York family, newlyweds Ginny and Lou, and Rhodes, who is transporting prisoner Robert Maine.Motel clerk Larry calmly checks everyone in, not exactly upset by all the chaos. But there's no working phone, and one of the potential guests seriously needs emergency help. Ed tries, but there's too much flooding to make it to a hospital and even cell phones don't work.Ed, a former cop, tries to take charge of the situation, though Rhodes seems to think he should be in charge. And then people start dying. And the prisoner escapes. The newlyweds are in Room 6, and the number falls, making it look like a 9. The main clues to the murders are keys found with the bodies, and the keys seem to be showing up in sequence--10, 9, 8, 7 ...So who will survive? Who is really behind the murders? And how are Malick and Rivers connected to all this? I found the early scenes fascinating. Everyone was connected to everyone else, and if one event hadn't happened, none of the others would have. Eventually, I was just plain confused because I didn't know what was going on.And when the murderer was finally revealed, he or she was not really revealed. I felt like I had heard three different possibilities but not been told which one was the right one. Then again, maybe I was told more information than was needed, and some of it was irrelevant. But I can't believe they would go THIS far ...There were a lot of good acting performances. I genuinely dislike John McGinley, but he played a totally different character here than what I am used to. He seemed compulsive and somewhat mentally ill but genuinely desired to do the right thing.Gary Busey was scary and almost funny, not too different from some of his other bad guy characters.Bret Loehr didn't have much to do early as the little boy who had lost one parent and seemed likely to lose two more. But he was quite good later.John Cusack carried the movie. He showed frustration but also competence. His character wasn't perfect but he wanted to do the best he could and didn't have patience with those who didn't care about others or couldn't handle the situation.And Rebecca DeMornay did the demanding celebrity routine quite well.I'm not going to recommend this for family viewing because some of the bodies are hard to look at.It's mostly a worthy effort.",Null,5,8,29 July 2013
The Ugly Truth," The truth is pretty
","At the start of the movie, one of several terrible songs is played. These songs represent a musical style that is apparently either enjoyed by Katherine Heigl or by her fans.Abby is the uptight yet attractive producer of a morning news program, though in recent years the program has become mostly fluff, something Abby does not approve of.While she is watching TV at home, Abby's cat D'Artagnan accidentally switches the channel and Abby finds herself watching Mike, a man with outrageous (though not unusual for men) opinions about relationships between men and women. It could be worse; one of his competitors says things like 'No really means yes'.Mike takes calls from viewers, so Abby calls and gives him a piece of her mind. Mike also figures out what Abby's ideal man would be.The next morning Abby is shocked to find Mike at her TV station as the newest member of the cast of her TV show. His segment will be called 'The Ugly Truth'.D'Artagnan helps Abby find her ideal man. When the kitty gets trapped up in a tree, Abby must go rescue him. When Abby gets hurt trying to get out of the tree, she is rescued by her new neighbor Colin, a doctor who is everything Abby wants. Abby turns into a giggling teenager. The next day at work, she is her uptight self again, but with prettier hair.Mike helps Abby prepare to date Colin. She needs to do a lot to make herself pretty, including buying new clothes. At this point it becomes clear that although Abby absolutely despises Mike, we surely believe that by the end of the movie she will end up with either Mike or Colin.Meanwhile, Mike does so well it is possible his show will go national and Abby will have to find a replacement.Katherine Heigl does a very good job. At first, she is too hard to like and I find myself not even caring what will happen to her. She's not even good looking. Later, she is gorgeous and even easy to like. The fact that she can go from uptight rhymes-with-witch to a giggling teenager helps a lot.Gerard Butler is a challenge to like (I would have preferred a Tim Allen type) but he's just right for the role. As a guy I would find myself liking his wild ideas on women. But even I found myself sort of hoping he would get the girl rather than Colin.I know Nick Searcy best as the Frank Burns type head of security on the time travel series 'Seven Days'. Here, he is much easier to like and does quite a good job as Abby's boss.When I saw this movie it had a TV-PG rating with a D for dialogue, though some of the sexual humor is quite potent, and I would definitely not call this a family film. I did like one gag involving a product one would buy at a store selling sex toys. Seeing this movie helped me get a joke I heard recently on TV's 'Rules of Engagement'. Of course, the movie follows a formula, but I like the formula. The challenges are silly and we do ride an emotional roller-coaster, but everything will be all right in the end, right?I actually think the truth is quite pretty.",Null,1,2,10 October 2012
Windtalkers," Educates about code talkers, but not really about them; pretty good otherwise
","I had heard about the Code Talkers and understood their efforts were important to winning World War II. I found the idea of watching a movie about their efforts interesting.I didn't really understand how Nicolas Cage getting in a jam in the Solomon Islands and acting heroically contributed to that, but I kept watching. Eventually, I made the connection. His flawed and damaged character was being put in charge of keeping a Code Talker safe. I hadn't considered the possibility of a Code Talker being put in a combat situation, and yet this movie made clear how vital their efforts were even on the battlefield. We also got to see how risky it was to be a Code Talker in this situation, since the Japanese somehow knew about these people and would find them valuable. Yes, the possibility of the code being revealed to the enemy has a tragic consequence. Many hard decisions were made here.Although I wasn't really prepared for battle and didn't like the violence that went with it, combat scenes were effectively done. Nicolas Cage, of course, is a Rambo or Schwarznegger which is good for movie audiences if not necessarily realistic. The relationships that develop between fighting men made the movie interesting.Adam Beach did a fine job and was quite likable. Whether he looked like an Indian or not, and whether he really looked Japanese (which became important in one scene), didn't matter to me. I went with my neighbors to the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina a few years ago and the campaign billboards, during a race for chief, showed a man who could have passed for white. Actually, Beach looked more like the other type of Indian. But the important thing was his character's pride in his heritage, and the scenes that showed his culture, particularly with his friend Charlie Whitehorse. The scenery in the American West is great. And the areas where combat took place also are nice to look at.I was impressed that one of the military bases somehow got a 50-star flag more than 15 years before there were actually 50 states. I wonder when that flag was developed? Still, a regular 48-star flag would have been better for consistency.If the objective was to tell people this film was about Code Talkers and to focus on a flawed but heroic white marine and show the Code Talkers' battlefield actions as a supplement to the main plot, then I believe the goal was achieved.",Null,1,1,2 September 2015
The Breakfast Club," I can see why people thought it was great, but I didn't like that much of it
","This may contain spoilers.Five high school students confined to the school library all day on a Saturday, told not to move or talk, and to write an essay, while a teacher kept the door open and listened from across the hall.  Sounds boring. Fortunately, the students didn't obey.  First Bender started misbehaving, and I thought his ranting and  clowning around were going to be the best part.  Then the other students joined in.  One has to wonder where that teacher was during all of this and why he couldn't hear so much of what was going on.  Eventually, he couldn't hear because he was in the basement looking through files trying to find dirt. I didn't think Ally Sheedy was going to talk through the entire movie, or when she did talk, that she was going to be conservative with her words. Not so.  But she was quite effective when she didn't talk.  Judd Nelson was very good but some of his behavior went over the edge.  I liked the funny parts, especially when the students managed to escape and run around the school.  Even though I didn't care for the music, I liked watching them dance--especially Molly Ringwald. And I liked seeing them become friends when they were getting along. I could see why this movie was regarded so highly once the students started having deep discussions, though that didn't mean I liked that part. Overall, the movie focused too much on the unpleasantness in the students' lives that led to their behavior which got them punished.  I didn't care for that.  At least one good thing:  I didn't have to hear the movie with all the bad language left in, and it appeared there was a lot of it.",Null,0,0,7 September 2003
Goodfellas," Too violent. And Joe Pesci wasn't funny enough.
","I was hoping Joe Pesci would be more like in his comedy movies.  There were some great looking cars and great songs early in the movie, but other than that there wasn't much to make this movie appealing.  I only watched it because of Pesci and the movie's many honors or at least nominations for them.  Paul Sorvino did a good acting job.  But the people in this movie were not very nice at all.  I knew they wouldn't be, but they just killed people like it was an everyday thing.  And I can't imagine what the language would have been like if I hadn't seen the tv version.  I just wouldn't have bothered otherwise.",Null,2,5,25 November 2002
The Wizard of Oz," The best movie ever
","This was an annual event for me growing up. And I had a children's record and a colorfully illustrated version of the book. Eventually, I realized i had seen this movie so many times there was no point in seeing again. Until my parents finally got a color TV in 1986. I saw this in color for the first time and experienced the movie in a whole new way. And for the first time I got the joke about the 'Horse of a Different Color'. Later, there was a behind-the-scenes special hosted by Angela Lansbury that gave me new insights.In the last several times I have seen this movie, I found new ways to appreciate this movie, and saw things I hadn't seen before. I won't go into all of them here.The real sign of a quality movie: everyone gives a good performance, regardless of how few lines. The head of the Witch's guards had only three lines but his delivery was worthy of the great epic movies. And even the dog gave a good performance!Judy Garland may have given the best performance by a teen in the history of motion pictures. I can't imagine anyone else in the role, even though Frank Baum wrote the book for a younger girl and Shirley Temple was considered. Not only did Garland make Dorothy quite appealing and intelligent, but she could sing like few actors have. It was only in recent years that I truly appreciated the excellence of Frank Morgan. I didn't realize for many years that he played the bumbling guard at the entrance to Emerald City, or the carriage driver, or the frustrated man who wouldn't let anyone in to see the Wizard. He was very funny in those roles, of course, but even Professor Marvel was something special, kindly and caring even as he was being deceptive. The Wizard, of course, was a very fine role, and Morgan portrayed the man brilliantly. Such a warm and compassionate man when he could be, but scared to face other people and reveal who he really was, and somewhat scatterbrained--this was part of his appeal.Just as Dorothy did, I believe I liked The Scarecrow most of all. Ray Bolger did another excellent job, giving the character warmth, humor and friendliness and, yes, intelligence. And he could dance! He had great chemistry with Dorothy and with The Lion. And probably the Tin Man, too. The Lion had a unique appeal. He was very funny because he tried to act tough but was really scared of everything. Fighting for Dorothy, though, gave him courage. Margaret Hamilton made The Wicked Witch of the West one of the scariest characters in motion pictures. Add music, and this movie can be truly chilling. And yet, there was a certain fake kindness in her manner. As Miss Gulch in Kansas, she was also quite evil.As evil as The Witch of the West was, that's how very kind The Witch of the North came across. So compassionate and perky. And The Munchkins were fun. I haven't mentioned The Tin Man much, but he just wasn't one of my favorite characters. But Jack Haley made him such an emotional character for someone who said he didn't have a heart. He cared so much about Dorothy. I can't forget Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. She was a stern but loving substitute mother for Dorothy, and Uncle Henry was comical and not particularly believable as someone who could run a farm (Aunt Em seemed like she ran things). I'd have liked to have known Uncle Henry better.And the music! Not just 'Over the Rainbow', one of the great musical performances in movie history, but also the very funny songs in Oz. And in the 1930s, background music could usually be very pleasant. Even in the tornado, as objects and even men in a rowboat flew by!As I said, I have a version of the book. I have also seen John Ritter's TV movie on the life of Frank Baum. There are times when this movie wavers from Baum's version. Instead of being isolated in a very spartan home, Dorothy's family lives in a community and in a nice house (for their economic status, anyway), with farm hands who showed up later in the movie along with a fortune teller and a troublemaking busybody also not part of the book. The adventure was a dream. No Witch of the South (The Witch of the North appears twice). No green glasses in Emerald City because everything is green. I have no problem with any of these because the movie was so perfectly executed. Is this too scary for kids? The tornado certainly was scary enough, and the Flying Monkeys too. I guess it's up to parents. But this is a wonderful adventure for all ages.",Null,1,3,24 May 2005
