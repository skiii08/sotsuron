E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Fly him to the moon
","Back in 1982 when ET first came out a patron of the library I work at told me that I HAD TO SEE THIS MOVIE,and to take a box of tissues with me. Bear in mind that this gentleman was a very urbane,if somewhat cynical college professor. Not the type I would have expected to recommend a film so highly.  I took his advise. THANK YOU HOWARD. Next to 'The day the earth stood still' ET ranks as my favorite sci-fi film of all time. The newly inhanced version is excellent too.  Henry Thomas is delightful and the middle child ,Elliott who find and befriends ET. He is not 'too cute',but gives a terrific performance,especially when ET telepathically makes him drunk.The end of the movie still makes me cry,maybe not a whole box of tissues worth by now,but there is just something about ET and Elliott's good bye that tears me up.The two principle adults, Dee Wallace(Stone) and Peter Coyote are good too.  Coyote, who is only known as 'Keys' is in some respects almost as innocent as Elliott, and you wish that he had been able to have more contact with ET.  Although the scenes where the house is being sealed off is frightening, it still works. The scene where Elliot and his brother steal the van is priceless when older brother comes out with the memorable line 'I've never driven forward before!' I am planning to buy this on DVD as soon as possible.  ET,you can phone my home or visit any time",10,62,95,19 May 2003
