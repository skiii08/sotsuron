Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An Awesome 'Star Wars' Experience
","What a terrific show!  I cannot see how critics can drag this film down. It has everything, but most importantly...it's fun! Numerous events in the film beautifully and clearly foreshadow events yet to come in the series. I must say that this, for the most part is a praising review.A great movie pretty much throughout.  First ten minutes exciting like a 007 film.  It slows down after that, but only to start building the plot, which lacked slightly, but this is after all Chapter 1 of a saga.  It really made me excited about the next 2 films.  In those, the real darkness will rise as this was just a first step.Acting was about what you expect from a Star Wars film, not Oscar-winning, but good.  Jake Lloyd was good for playing a 10-year old Anakin Skywalker. Lloyd plays his part aggressively and realistically like it should be played.  Anakin is very similar to Luke in Star Wars: A New Hope, wide-eyed and adventurous, and no one criticized Mark Hamil until RotJ.  McGregor was more than commendable as Obi-Wan with his accent almost frighteningly identical to that of Alec Guinness.  Neeson was fine, yet acting to a blue screen doesn't seem like his favorite role.  I personally loved him as Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.  Portman seemed uncomfortable in her 'interesting' attire, but was very good in her interactions with Anakin. McDiarmad was stunning in his reprisal of Emperor/Senator Palpatine. Manipulative and strong.  Assuming you have never seen the original trilogy, you would almost like the guy, but have suspicion. Serafinowicz is good with the voice.  Lastly, Jar Jar Binks.  Funny at first, but became a little annoying, but never the less a plus.  'How Wude' never ceased to make me laugh.Overall, great fun for everyone. Darth Maul could have used some more screen time, but his rareness created his mystique.  I must agree with Leonard Maltin that this is a Star Wars movie and belongs right up with the rest.  (Maltin gave the original trilogy 4 stars).  Go see it, it's not that hard to get tickets.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
