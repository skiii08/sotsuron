Blade Runner 2049," Simply sensational
","I was blown away. This is the best looking film I have ever seen, the visual effects are spectacular! It takes everything the first film does well and massively improves them, like the world-building and the symbolism and the special effects. The cinematography is breathtaking and the directing is a masterclass, much credit goes to Roger Deakins and Denis Villenueve. Ryan Gosling doesn't have a character arc so much as a character circle which is refreshing and presents a nice message. All the performances are good, nothing great, they all work really well for the roles. There's lots of imagery, I noticed a lot of eye imagery which has connections to the soul. The sound design and score were really nice. My only problems with the film are that some scenes last too long like the scene where Ryan Gosling is exploring where Harrison Ford is, the film as a whole I felt was paced well and didn't feel it's length but some scenes dragged. Also some of the audio was a bit echoey and hard to hear. Maybe that was to reflect the emptiness of the characters but I don't know for sure. On the whole a fantastic experience, more films like this should be made",9,3,7,15 March 2018
Fight Club," Ignoring the obvious
","Everyone loves this film. I can see why, the first time I watched it I thought I loved it, but everytime I watch it, it gets significantly worse. Ok, the twist is stupid, spoilers they are the same person but that doesn't make sense because in the rest of the film they have conversations in public with people around them but it's just one guy talking to himself . I would understand it if people looked strangely at them as it would show something was up but they don't it's just lazy, not much smart is done to set up the twist yeah they do that whole thing that Tyler durden says to not talk to Marla about him but that's it the twist just happens and makes no sense, then he shoots himself in the cheek which kills Tyler. COME ON! That makes no sense why couldn't he just die. Ok I quite like the message but it is made redundant when the film has whorish product placement that just undermines the whole message. I don't like the fact that the film starts with the most interesting part, I find that a bit lazy. Helena Bonham Carter horribly overacts. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are fine nothing special and David Fincher does a good job directing, i like the tone and colour palette. I think the film looks nice. However the more I think about all the dumb shit and the dull monologue it just gets worse and worse",4,0,2,16 March 2018
