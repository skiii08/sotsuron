Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 250 Million Thumbs Down
","I am not going to lower myself to give this trash a standard review. Consider this a friendly tip if you're thinking about renting (or God forbid,buying) this film.There aren't enough adjectives to describe how terrible this 'film' is. Cohen a genius??? No no no my friend. Cohen a nobody wannabe star who'd lick bull testicles if he knew it'd bring him 10 seconds of fame is more like it.A shame to the motion picture industry.Cohen has faded into his all too familiar world of forgoteness. And there, I am sure, he will remain.",1,1,3,21 May 2008
