Alien 3," wretched, horrible loser of a flick with one funny scene
","This piece of waste is a total disappointment to anyone who came close to liking the first two.  The only good moment is: just after the 'dog alien' pulls a monk/prisoner to his off-camera blood-spraying death, (and ignoring for the moment that the survivors decide it's ok to play next to the hole in the ceiling it *just* left through) another monk/prisoner has a tremendously funny look on his face as he mops up the remains, casting furtive hole-ward glances... (giggle.) But, to get *to* this point, the viewers have to suffer through about, oh, 500 other scenes that are total crap, the off-camera, totally inconsequential deaths of Hicks and Newt, the shaved-head look for Ripley(conveniently *after* the 'magic makeup' sex scene - one shot, they're about to kiss, no makeup, next shot, they're starting in, and *paf*, ripley gets a makeover!) ... enjoy if you can! </rant>",1,4,8,11 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing. This is the second movie this year that's left me hungry for more.
","After all the hype, all the waiting, and all the 'oh, crap, Jar Jar Binks is just here to draw the Ewok-fan vote,' all I can say is this film was great. It was brilliant.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Jar Jar was the only bit I thought could have been better, and my only change would have been to make him more competent, less slapsticky.  This is truly a fine Star Wars film, ranking higher than Return of the Jedi, but not quite up to Empire (my personal favorite)... This film was just so well put together, all the nuances and details were perfectly done... Can't say much more without spoilers, but I feel the wait was worth it, and am starving for more.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
