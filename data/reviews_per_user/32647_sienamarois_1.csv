The Ring," Slightly Disappointed
",So I was showing my friend her first horror movie ever and i decided to put on the Ring. Highly disappointed in how little horror we saw. I wish it was a bit scarier. Usually when I think of a horror movie I think of having to cover my face with my hands and having tiny screams escape my mouth. I would recommend the movie though since the acting was spectacular and the storyline was beautifully created.,4,1,1,1 March 2020
