The Ring," How many times will you jump?
","Movies usually don't scare me. Even the ones that are supposed to. This one did. Yes, you have to get past the plot line full of holes and suspend your disbelief, but how many horror movies actually make sense? This film is stylish with great cinematography and images that will haunt you for a while. It is quiet unbelievable that it is only rated PG-13 because it would scare the bejesus out of any more or less impressionable child (more on that later). It scared the bejesus out of an impressionable adult - me. I am pretty sure that this film made me jump and say 'sh@t' more then any that I have seen in a while. I would highly recommend not going to see it by yourself and have someone to sleep with after. In my case that would be my girlfriend. We sat in the theater grabbing onto each other and were sure glad we didn't have to come home alone. The characters are not deeply developed and like I have said the story is ludicrous when you actually think about it. But if you forget all that for a moment and remember why you came (to get scared) this movie is one of the best horror films to come out in a few years. It simply works. Yes, it might not be incredibly original in what devices it uses to make your skin crawl, but the skin crawling effect definitely happens. It never lets go and keeps your senses tuned in. The story ties itself more or less well at the end, perhaps leaving more then a possibility for a sequel. I have no qualms recommending it. Definitely not a waste of your money and one to see at the theater as it would lose a lot of its luster on video. One more thing. Someone at our viewing took what looked like a five or six years old girl to it. Please check your head and do not create more psychos that are already floating around in this world! That poor little girl will have nightmares for the next 10 years and someday many of her phobias and weird behavior could be traced back to her moronic older sister taking her to see a film like this. Adults need to remember that children are hundreds of times more impressionable and have no reference points or experience to control their fears. This movie is very scary for a well balanced adult. I can't even imagine what impact the elaborately created, incredibly creepy visions that stick in one's mind would have on a little child.",9,0,0,28 October 2002
War Machine," What the f@#k is the point of modern counterinsurgency warfare?
","Brad Pitt's Netflix movie (loosely based on General McChrystal's Afghanistan experience) is a deadpan comedy about how stupid modern American wars are. Absolutely no one knows what the f@#k they're doing or why they're doing it, the goal of winning a counterinsurgency war is delusional and impossible to achieve. The locals hate us and wonder why the f@#k we came to their country. The soldiers don't have any answers either. Except for some really thick ones who get a hard on from wearing the uniform, drink the Koolaid & believe they're doing something important. F@#k the politicians that think they have good reasons to start these idiotic wars. Never support one. None of them have anything to do with 'keeping America safe'.",9,3,5,31 July 2017
