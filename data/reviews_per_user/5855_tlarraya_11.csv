Blade Runner 2049," Terribly long and disapponiting
","This movie is terribly long (about 2 hours and a half) and there isn´t much to tell. There are at least 45 minutes of this film that could be deleted. The visuals are good, the actors are good but there is not much of a story to be told. It´s a let down.",1,6,12,14 January 2018
Wind River," Good solid movie
","I really liked this movie. It was meaningful and moving. It was dark, gritty but still beautiful. It touches your heart strings. The acting was spot on, really good performances. This movie is worth seeing, which isn't easy to find nowadays. Go watch this, you won't regret it. It did remind me a little bit of Fargo.",9,13,21,22 October 2017
Last Flag Flying," I liked it
",I enjoyed this movie. ItÂ´s not the best movie but it has laugh aloud moments and touching moments. The acting is great. 2 of the main actors are like the angel and the devil on the shoulders of the third main character. I had a good time watching this.,8,3,7,22 January 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Astounding, a 10!
","I loved this movie. I hadn´t seen a movie that deserved a 10 I think since Million Dollar Baby maybe. The story is great, the acting is marvellous and you don´t know what´s going to happen. A 10.",10,2,6,20 January 2018
Baby Driver," Not as good as the reviews would have you believe
",Not as good as the reviews would have you believe. But I still think it 's probably a very cool film for teenagers. I think they might get a vibe similar to what Grease did for us when we were teenagers. And that 's high praise. Still not a good film for adults. We were expecting more from a movie that has been said to be one of the best if not the best movie of 2017.,7,2,5,22 September 2017
Dunkirk," Just ok
","I was expecting much more from this movie. Sure, the filming and acting were great but there isn´t much to tell. The story didn´t make up for the length of the movie. Just ok.",5,0,4,18 January 2018
Get Out," I really liked this movie!
","It's hard to find a good film to recommend these days, but this is. It was original and surprising. It is filled with tension and its fast- paced so it keeps your interest throughout the film. The acting is good. The dialogues are good. It was better than I expected. It's not exactly a horror film (which I don't tend to like). And it felt like an instant classic. I recommend this one.",8,9,16,21 May 2017
Hidden Figures," I liked it
","I liked this movie. I think it's a story worth telling. In fact, you can't believe that these 3 outstanding women were all at the same place at the same time. It just blows my mind. And I felt it was nice to know about this other side of the story, since we have seen the story of the astronaut's white wives in a TV show and there are other movies about this period. I really recommend it and my husband does too. So it's good for a wide audience. Great movie!",8,8,17,26 April 2017
Coco," I enjoyed this more than I expected
",I enjoyed this movie more than I expected. It made me cry in a good way. It had surprising twists for a Disney movie. I recommend this movie.,9,2,4,31 March 2018
The Shape of Water," I loved it!
","I wasn´t sure what to expect, but I loved it. I smiled and enjoyed the whole movie. A beautiful film. Great acting, photography and story.",9,37,68,23 February 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," So boring
",It was hard not to dall sleep towards the end of this film. I has high expectations because of the famous actors but it was a total let down.,1,16,32,14 February 2018
