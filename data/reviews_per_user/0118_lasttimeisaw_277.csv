The King's Speech," The King's Speech: 7/10
","The fact that this film fails to impress me does surprise myself, the accumulating buzz in the upcoming Oscar can only explain one thing, that some people don't want to see a sweep of THE SOCIAL NETWORK, which will definitely cause the whole Oscar game way too predictable, so they select one out of other nine BEST PICTURE-nominated films, and keep everybody by rivaling these two so-called frontrunners. In my personal list, currently THE SOCIAL NETWORK is my No.3 of the year, INCEPTION and THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT are my No.1 and No.2 respectively. After watching this film, I must confess that I am 90% sure BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR will go to TSN. TKS is a solid film, an unparalleled stammer performance from Colin Firth, which will endow him with his first Oscar in the BEST ACTOR category (I love Colin, but he should win last year with A SINGLE MAN instead of this one). Geoffrey Rush is strong but patchy in his co-leading role (typically not a supporting role, anyway category fraud does attenuate Oscar's halo), his insidious eyes and cartoonish appearance emancipated a rather uncomfortable perception to me and it's hard to believe he was not playing a vicious villain. As Helena Bonham Carter, her self-restrained acting, on the contrary, becomes my favorite in the film, she could be a potential dark horse in the Oscar race. Guy Pearce and Jennifer Ehle both offer some nuance in spite of their limited screen-time. As a whole, the film is an exquisite design, almost everything is on a high-class level, except the empathy, I feel no emotional turbulence all along the time, every twist is stock, It was as if I was watching a chic play (without involuntary affection at all) as the same time I don't care what was happening in the film, which I was too placid to care. In my opinion, the mordant script is the most award-worthy one among all its nominations.I felt baffled after watching the film, because I don't think my taste is so far away from others (judging by previous experience of course), how come this time TKS truly disappointed me so much? Maybe a re-watch? I don't know by now.",7,0,2,24 February 2011
The Lobster," accepting the anomalies should be the new normal
","Eccentric Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos' fifth feature, four years after ALPS (2011), is an Ireland-based multi-national English-speaking production starring Colin Farrell as David, a misfit in a dystopian society aka. the City where couples are the norm and all single people are given a 45- day stint to stay in The Hotel and find a partner, otherwise they will be transformed into an animal. David's wife has passed away recently and lobster is the animal he chooses to be if he fails the mission, which instantly reminds me the reference of the claw-holding lobsters in FRIENDS, it is the symbol of true love, but here David gives away his own reasons: blue-blood, longevity, fertility and his love of ocean, yet we should also know, lobsters are blind.Farrell undergoes a formidable physical transmogrification into a portly middle-aged architect, and is stripped off any celebrity glamour with his bookish semblance and unwieldy awkwardness, in the hotel, he meets two single fellows, a lisping man (Reilly), a limping man (Whishaw), and tries to woo a nosebleed woman (Barden) while refuses the courtship from the biscuit woman (Jensen), as he confesses, pretending to have a feeling for someone whom you don't is the hardest. Meanwhile all the singles in the hotel are regularly organised to hunt for loners - those single people who rebels against the City and live in the woods. For catching a loner, their stint will be extended for one day, but David is not very good at it, the deadline is pressing, he concedes to his proclivity for short- haired woman and chooses a heartless woman (a steely Papoulia) as the last resort, who is the record-holder of the loner-hunting and has no urgency to end up her single status. It is a terrible mistake, eventually David sneaks out of the hotel and plunges into the wood, becomes a loner himself, which brings the film into the second half, the world of loners.Loners lead by a French woman (Seydoux), they conform to the doctrine where no relationships are allowed among loners, they cannot have sex, cannot dance together, even flirting will be punished by 'red kiss', it is the exact the other side of the coin from the City, however, David again, is a misfit here, since he falls for a short-sighted loner (Weisz), David is myopic too, their romance develops steadily, they even invent a set of body language only can be understood by themselves, to communicate with each other without being too intimate in front of others, a make-up free Weisz elicits a memorable presence radiant of earnestness and compassion. But the leader finds it out eventually, and deprives the woman of myopia. And then the two decide to flee together and enter the City as a couple, with one big decision for David to take, to test how strong their love is, and after a suspicious long-take, the film ends without revealing what has happened to David, and what's next for the star-crossed lovers.In spite of the outr√© setting of the story, unlike the elusive ALPS, the film puts forth a quite comprehensible narrative arc which channelled by a woman's voice-over (later viewers would know it is from the short-sighted woman's journal), and leaves audience hooked in the idiosyncrasy of the concept and the exigency of David (and his lover)'s plight. Relying on dramatic classical pieces, including a smart exploitation of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' WHERE THE WILD ROSES GROW hummed ominously by David; contrasting landscape and scenes of hotel and wood, outskirt and city; highly stylish camera-work from Thimios Bakatakis (slo-motions and long-takes are put into action during crucial moments), Lanthimos' metaphysical methodology of exposing the deep- rooted alienation among human individuals ends up with an impressive high note with THE LOBSTER, it is a slap-in-the-face ridicule about rigid conformism, whether being single or staying as a couple, accepting the anomalies should be the new normal.",8,2,6,13 January 2016

","I am literally have no any idea about baseball and cannot extract any gaiety or thrill from watching it (actually I am very much sport-immune). So the challenge of the film lies in the fact that whether or not it will be able to win over more spectators who are usually out of the range of the sport genre, just like two years ago THE BLINDSIDE (2009) did (I know nothing about American football either but I emphatically enjoyed the film).Taking Pitt's role Billy Beane's words said to his assistant Peter Brand (career-best performance from Jonah Hill) in the film, 'he does not want to have any personal entanglement with any of his players, especially no emotion attached' (not literally though) , the film also detaches from its audience by throwing mathematic formulae and analytic statistics at the audience and imposes a condescending stance to water down the scientific theory so as to be accepted by outsiders like me. Also the narrative process is no less median than other sport biopics (namely, INVICTUS 2009, a same 6/10 rating), an over-abused underdog victory with a middle- of-the-road taste. The cast, I cannot deny it may be Pitt's best work so far (leaving THE TREE OF LIFE aside), but one hindrance is his subdued swagger almost pervasive in almost every film he stars and I have watched, which could be fitting in FIGHT CLUB 1999 or TWELVE MONKEYS 1995, even for OCEAN'S ELEVEN series, but in a biographic film, Mr. Jolie is not an acting chameleon like Meryl Streep, and he should drink the so-called 'make-up potion' to camouflage himself behind his role he plays. Additionally among the small satellites revolving around Pitt, Jonah Hill is seriously rooting for his first Oscar nomination (congratulations on his dual nominations in both SAG and Golden Globe, the same to Pitt and the film has nailed 4 Golden Globe nominations in toto, BEST MOTION PICTURE-DRAMA and BEST SCREENPLAY). Another VIP star Philip Seymour Hoffman has nothing to sprawl out in his funny uniform. Oscar nominated director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE 2005) may fall short of strong buzz to get himself into Oscar's consideration, however, the film is exquisitely made and the lengthy spiels which I shudder at may fare pretty well as the crowd-pleaser for those interlacing with both film and baseball domains.",6,0,0,15 December 2011
The Avengers," The Avengers
","Harboring a great deal of expectation of this record-breaking multi-superhero-in-a-row action mash-up, I finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen, but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012. Alerted by the general opinion of 'if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes, the latter part will blow you away', maybe 'boring' is a lesser word, the inter-conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest, and in light of my last encounter with THOR (2011), I know he is a boredom, then here comes his worsen twin, Captain America, so it is dumb and dumber situation. Most of characters are reprising their usual roles, Robert Downey Jr.'s sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota. So I assume the only revelation could come from Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, the newcomer on screen, and the third candidate of Hulk, Mark Ruffalo, but the truth is they might be a clear torrent, but cannot save this juggernaut from being a destroy-it-all dross. The fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not a false claim, but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul, director Joss Whedon just haphazardly levels everything in Manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility. No worries at all, we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know Iron Man will not be the sacrifice as a sequel is already set on a release date. Thus, am I over-demanding here? After the invasion of myriads of this sort of big-budget action flicks, THE AVENGERS is no way a standout by any means, none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence (I might be too desperate to count out Gwyneth Paltrow), Mark Ruffalo is the closest choice of a decent acting in it, all the rest is just the way he or she is, an utterly featherweight character study is the case here. The gags are scarce (ooh, poor Loki), too much SCI-FI doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest (thanks to you, Mr. Samuel L. Jackson) makes the film's lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted, and I waited until the end-credit rolled over, but a second bonus scenes never show off. The film's huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time (after AVATAR 2009 and TITANIC 1997) does make me do some solemn post-mortem to question my taste, the conclusion could be that I may be detached from the majority's liking, which thankfully I believe heralds a good sign for me, right?",5,6,14,2 June 2012
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Where do they spend the monstrous budget in this character-driven episode?
","This third installment of THE HUNGER GAMES arrives as appointed, although the money- grubbing maneuver to divide the final book into two movies can automatically repel those who are not in the fan-base, and feel disgusted by its rapacious appetite. Actually it is where I belong, unfortunately, Moore is the new addition in the cast, as President Coin, leadership usually is not in her wheelhouse, remember CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10)? Plus my perfectionist side urges me to continue since I have watched the first two THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10) and THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (2013, 6/10), for better or worse, I will definitely watch the final chapter next year to wrap it up, sorry to fall into the machination of capitalistic greed. However, I will keep a clear mind to next year's INSURGENT (2015) and MAZE RUNNER: SCORCH TRIALS (2015). One thing I do appreciate from this film is its subtle inclination to obscure the absolute dichotomy between the capital and the rebel and puts Katiness (Lawrence) into a moral dilemma, her unassuming personality and indomitable bravery enables the heroism which can motivate the suppressed hoi polloi, but here she is so easily being demoted as a propaganda weapon to wage a war against the capital, which for herself, she is not quite sure too. What's the difference will be if the rebel finally wins? The sacrifice will be grave, and no one can assure the new government will not follow the same old road to ruin. The story actually has a clearer mind towards the political game, but eventually the author and the filmmakers would all pander to what readers or audience want to read or watch: the final combat with barrages of visual spectacles and the corny love stories in the battlefield, so much for YA demography. Due to the fact that Part 1 only covers the preliminary measurement of the endgame and lacks of substantially tantalizing action pieces, apart from using her arrow shot down two bombers, Katiness is barely in the move, instead, she broaches a more dramatic mental reconstruction in the movie, Jennifer Lawrence noticeably has more close-ups on her rational struggle and personal revelation, she needs to fight her own conscience to be the war instigator, even it is under the name of righteousness, and finds her own place of being 'the one' instead of a replaceable pawn in the plot. It is her powerful acting (plus a mediocre singing) makes up for the discouraging inertness, still, it is not enough, especially for such a heavily budgeted tent-pole, the film never shows where do they use the massive money? Peeta (Hutcherson), although retreats to a talking head most of the time, Hutcherson in fact eventuates in a more admirable performance than rest of the group, especially he is the key variable in the final stage. Moore, with a fruitful awards season beckons, in here, what she pulls off is President Coin's affable persona, her air as a true altruistic leader, her gentle but affirmative deliverance is formulaic yet, under such circumstances, is affecting. As a Moore devotee who have never read Collins' novel, my wishful thinking is that there is a dramatic twist here to explode in the culmination concerning Coin's patina of inscrutability and caginess. Since Katiness is the sole center of the narrative, the bulky supporting crew is relegated to bells and whistles, it will be a shameful waste for Dormer's killing coiffure if her Cressida remains so characterless in the Part 2. Finally, it will be remiss not to mention the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, although it is really a nuisance to end his luminous career with such effortless offerings, he will be warmly remembered.",5,16,25,30 November 2014
Vertigo," Vertigo
","About two months ago, when Sight & Sound magazine announced their critics polls of my film of all time (a referendum carried out every decade), VERTIGO has unanticipatedly usurped CITIZEN KANE's seemingly invincible titleholder, which as a matter of course, has ensured many discordant responses, so it seems to be a perfect time to watch Hitchcock's (at least currently) cr√®me de la cr√®me. I eschewed any possible spoilers before embarking on the film (a BluRay set of 1996 restored version), it has been fully testified (regardless of the faintly drawn-out stalking sequences, great framing nevertheless) that a stirring frisson is duly on the course of solving the absorbing doppelg√§nger riddle. Visually there are some ground-breaking craftsmanship in the film, from the opening eye- focusing montages to the recurrent vertigo motif, even an abrupt cartoon snippet during the hair-raising nightmare scenes (which I estimate should be credited to the restore department). But the magnetic gravitation is the enigmatic pleasure from the perspective of a mutual love affair between a well-clad former detective and an equally enigmatic married woman (not the generic femme fatale brand though) whose motivation has been tainted since the very beginning. So in spite of that the set-up is almost immaculately deployed (until a rather second-rate glitch to culminate the finale), but one thing might not be so popular as it was half a century ago, the shifting role of female in the society, Kim Novak's character's vulnerability and fatalism infatuation just doesn't feel sound enough to elevate the plot onto the final peak. Partially it is also the performers' problem, Novak's glacial distance cannot pull herself through as a deft actor (neither for the scheme nor for the film), so it descends to a mere sexual impulse from James Stewart's standpoint, which I don't suppose is Hitchcock's idea. Also Stewart's paranoid 'minute copy' compulsion does mar some empathy toward him. The film at bottom is a two-hander, so Barbara Bel Geddes and Tom Helmore are the only supporting roles which are all underdeveloped, particularly, Bel Geddes' s one-sided affection has a buoyant start but completely sidelined after her inappropriate painting incident, leaving an unusual loose end. So the film has its old-fashioned value of love and done an acute anatomy of the hallucinatory symptoms when one falls for a feigned personality (the torture is bilateral), but calls it 'the best film ever' is a way too grave grandstanding which does no good to any films at all (even CITIZEN KANE has to pay its price), but I daresay 10 years later, VERTIGO will add another title under its belt, 'a one-time champion of the best film of all time'.",8,1,3,25 November 2012
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," this 90s flamboyant drag cult made from Down Under is truly, a hoot and a half
","Revisiting this 90s flamboyant drag cult made from Down Under, a trio of drag performers, two drag queens, Mitzi (Weaving) and Felicia (Pearce) and a trans-woman Bernadette (Stamp), embarks on a road trip on their titularly coined bus, from Sydney to the outback to perform their routines, en route, they meet multifarious people (whose reaction ranging from beneficent, gobsmacked, impassive, miffed to violent, and the juxtaposition between the aborigine and the white hicks is piercingly sharp) and each has his/her own generational revelation to cope with by the time their four-week-stint ends.Felicia, a sassy whippersnapper played by a sinewy Guy Pearce in his breaking-out cinema role, who constantly squabbles with Bernadette and has to learn his lesson in a hard way after he has a narrow escape from hate-crime induced mutilation, and Pearce is barnstorming to a fault, as if he is too self-aware of his orthodox masculine appearance, which he compensates with a patina of overlown effeminate affectation and posturing that runs to distracting, as we know that queer and masculine don't necessarily exclude each other, perceivably, he is the weakest link in the fold.Hugo Weaving's Mitzi, acting more natural in his persona's stage/private distinction, carries a more weighty responsibility when we realize he is married to a woman and they have an eight-year-old son Benji (Holmes), the burden of guilt and shame is what weighs down on every nonconformist being's soul, his tentative attempt to reconnect with Benj engages with a tender vulnerability that precariously avoids becoming saccharine, which says a lot about the performer's emotive strength. Nevertheless, the best performance unequivocally comes from Terence Stamp, whose Bernadette is long in the tooth, but she proves that wisdom, dignity and snide quips are amassed through years of hardened self-preservation against side-eyes and brandishing fists, Stamp embodies her with superlative poise larded with subtle cynicism and utter phlegm, which makes Bernadette's romantic kindling with a rough diamond Bob (Hunter) more like an unexpected boon than a hackneyed plot maneuver. The show must go on, and for a drag troupe of three, lip-syncing of queer-friendly iconic hits (Charlene's I'VE NEVER BEEN ME is an infectious show opener, which would be dusted off in Lynne Ramsay's YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE 2017, and rendered an idiosyncratically poignant effect) is just a one trick pony doesn't offer much variations, so their pageantry lives and dies with its gaudy, zany, eye-popping, varicolored, Oscar-winning apparel, particularly when being put into use against the vast topography in the middle of nowhere, and the crowning moment on the top of King's canyon, that majesty feeling of being unique in a cosmic world is so refreshing and life-affirming. Lastly, one cannot stress this enough, it is an unqualified relief that director/writer Stephan Elliott sticks to his guns with a less dramatic leitmotif to anchor his tragedy-prone subject matter in the most gracious way one can probably conceive, PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT is truly, a hoot and a half.",8,0,2,19 May 2018
Black Swan," Black Swan
","I watched twice this film in three days, after the second view, it still fascinates me so much, which makes it easily crack into my top 3 list of 2010.The film is the twin of Darren's last feature THE WRESTLER (2008), the quasi-identical path of a person pursues perfection in his/her life which requests huge sacrifice which he/she doesn't expect until the last moment of the finale. The tour-de-force performance by Natalie Portman is so magnetic insofar as to keep audience stick to their seats for the entire show and when the curtain falls, hailing her as the best performance of the year! I don't want to exaggerate how wonderful she is in interpreting two opposed role with perfect precision. Numerous BEST ACTRESS AWARDS cannot be wrong. The supporting cast is excellent as well, and Mila Kunis stands out distinctively as the imaginary black swan and the scintilla between her and Natalie slowly gives off as the film goes on until the peak moment. Also Barbara Hershey returns with a mighty and slightly creepy role as Natalie's control-freak mother and Vincent and Winona use great effort to become existential in their own ways. Another important merit of the film is its Darren's mastery as a director, the shaky-cum- close DV style captures every inch of the emotional turbulence of our swan queen and conveys to us a vividly on-the-scene wallop. Plus who could resist the elegant ballet choreography? The final showdown on the stage is done marvelously without any letup.The film is glutted with many nail-broken, blood-leaking, skin coming-off scenes, and by all means it is not an easy film suitable for everyone, but I recommend to anyone who would like to experience some mind-blowing brainwashing, this film will not fail you.",9,2,4,16 March 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
","I was harboring a disappointed heart after watching this film in cinema, a 3D version, even though I had not laid a high expectation on this one, in any case it is the fourth installation within 10 years, together with the franchise's downhill path, On Stranger Tides doesn't have any chance to breakthrough and revive its fame.Firstly, the script lacks its appealing vigor while the interwove plots are too disorganized to handle (particularly the limited screen time and omitted introduction of the Spaniard's team, which abruptly left the audience heads in the clouds), and I was also keen to find out how all the money had been spent, sad to say that only the man-eating mermaids bring some freshness and could be ranked as a gratifying discovery. The special effects are merely served to fulfill their original functions here (which simply attests that they really spent tons of doughs instead of appropriating them into their own pockets), let alone to be visually impressive or mentally inspiring. The 3D effect could not save it (like Thor, I don't know why the hue is always so dark as to some scenes are beyond recognition). Speaking of the actors, Jack Sparrow's idiosyncratic personality is being way over-exploited, and his new love interest Penelope Cruz is not at her best state, the chemistry between was looming but never had really accomplished. a extended screen time of Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa solely causes him unreasonably abominable, Ian McShare has a dramatic opening as the evil Blackbeard, but very soon his character becomes preposterously ridiculous and will suffer the loss of credibility. Desperately, my only guilty pleasure comes from Judi Dench and Keith Richards' cameo. Although I may pessimistically point out that the Pirates of the Caribbean series is on its own dooming destiny, the fact is that after its first week global release, its overall box-office is on fire right now (particularly overseas main markets and China is of course included), so predictably the fifth one will not be mission impossible, I have one suggestion, please fire director Rob Marshal, don't entitle him to further ruin the golden-signboard of Disney Films anymore!",5,0,2,25 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Men In Black III
","Saw the film in cinema with a 2D version, after 4 years absence from the screen, Will Smith eventually returns with his most tailor-made MIB suit as Agent J (with his craggier partner, Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K and the director at the helm of the franchise, Barry Sonnenfeld), the third installment keeps flourishing with all kinds of extraterrestrial creatures which serves its purpose to marvel the audience, that is, a chief achievement not only for this film but also for the entire series. Another requisite component is the wisecrack-gimmicks between J and K, the young Vs. old/ black Vs. white pair scrupulously sparks in the first half until the time travel gizmo operates, a straight-face Josh Brolin as the younger version of K (he is only 29 in the film? Nobody buys that, right?) doesn't register any screen chemistry with Mr. Smith. So with an ambiguous testimony for the sake of time-travel and aliens attack, the film has lost its beacon and the villain (Boris the Animal) is so airheaded and doesn't even has any kick and weight throughout (Boris' revolting kiss with Nicole Scherzinger has forewarned the film's scurrility and slackness) ! Several passable gags like the O, K quip, a Andy Warhol mockery, Lady Gaga and Ming Yao's glance among the E.T. files are the gist of its integral viability as a summer blockbuster, the visual effects are just too standard compared with any other mega-budget productions. Among the supporting cast, a genie-like Michael Stuhlbarg as the hyper-intellectual Griffin who has a superpower to foresee the future and a M-in-the-room stance from Emma Thompson are indeed scene stealers. A gimmick of going back to 1969 has its intentionally retrospective charm has a and its plot fabrication with moon-landing also shows some shrewd wit in re-igniting the zeal from the modern-day audience (after all there is a 10 years gap between), but in the very end, especially after a saccharine father-bonding finale, it is only a wishful thinking, I hope at least it could revive Will Smith's screen presence, which should be the minimum favor and purpose of its own genesis.",5,1,5,6 June 2012
Love and Death," wallows in Woody Allen's idealistic vim and vigour
","Into his eighties, Woody Allen is prolific as ever, his annual output has been tenaciously consistent, although these most recent ones seem to have lost his mojo after the unexpected resurgence of plaudits for MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011) and a Cate Blanchett Oscar-bait showcase BLUE JASMINE (2013).So one might feel more inclined to visit Allen's time-honroured earlier works, LOVE AND DEATH, his sixth feature, a kooky war parody gets certain inspiration from classic Russian novel. During the Napoleonic Wars, Boris Grushenko (Allen), is the weakling of his Russian family, a bookish pacifist, the characteristic Allen-esque persona, pining for his twice-removed cousin Sonja (Keaton), but the latter doesn't reciprocate with the same feeling, apart from their unbidden philosophical babble. When Napoleon (Tolkan, impersonates the personage with po-faced drollness) invades Austria, Boris and his brothers are enlisted in the Russian Army and sent to the front. However incompetent Boris is as a front-line soldier, a ludicrous and scarcely credible plot-device makes him a war hero.Reunited with Sonja, who has just widowed after the departure of her herring merchant husband Voskovec (Frieder), Boris tactfully has his wicked way with a man-eater Countess Alexandrovna (Georges-Picot), and miraculously survives from a duel between him and the latter's enraged lover and marksman Anton (Gould), more significantly, he takes advantage of Sonja's sympathy (who can refuse a man's dying wish?) and they marry eventually although it is to Sonja's great chagrin, according to her ideal theory of love's three aspects: intellectual, spiritual and sensual, Boris has never even been on her to-do list.Time comes to the rescue, Sonja gradually softens her harsh view towards Boris, who instead, is plagued by the notion of suicide, since childhood, death has always fascinated and engrossed him, from his surreal dream of men coming out of coffins, to a chance meeting with the Grim Reaper himself as a child, until a t√™te-√†-t√™te with a dead soldier in the battleground. Just when their relationship ameliorates and they decide to start a family, Napoleon invades the Russian Empire, Boris proposes to flee, but Sonja broaches a bold plan to assassinate Napoleon out of ire. Together, they impersonate as the visiting Spanish count and his sister, to meet Napoleon at his headquarter in Moscow, but the dispute between murder and moral conscience troubles Boris, when the crunch arrives, can he administer the coup de gr√¢ce? Or, is it a death knell for him to finally be take away by the Grim Reaper?Throwaway jest aplenty, gallows humour delights, even the smart-aleck himself candidly confesses 'my disgustingness is my best feature', LOVE AND DEATH remarkably buries Allen's usual pedantic pretension one inch beneath the tongue-in-cheek farce, also a full-blown Diane Keaton begins to upstage Allen with her comedic bent and emotive voltage.Blatant homages to Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957) and PERSONA (1966) aside, the movie also pays tributes to various comedians with slapstick humour and self-conscious doublespeak, adopting a fine selection of passages from modern-classic Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, LOVE AND DEATH wallows in Woody Allen's idealistic vim and vigour, not his best, but definitely belongs to the brighter side.",7,1,1,31 July 2016
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows
","My very first cinema encounter in 2012 is the sequel of a reverberating bromance action flick of Sherlock Holmes and his lover Dr. Watson, two years after the triumph of the unorthodox trio - Guy Ritchie, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law - of rebooting the household name into a bankable cash inflows, this time, at the same Christmas/New Year season, the threesome orgy revels in a more unrestrained burlesque, while all the detective-related mind-trickery is watered down in spite of Prof. Moriaty's existence (an underrated Jared Harris).The film has some self-consciously insipid moments during its 129 minutes running time, for the hefty action sequences, either those slow-motion or pre-mind fighting is overly abused, which functions eloquently in the first episode, nevertheless, the same question here, do we really need Holmes to be an action star like Bruce Lee? (anyway, it could not be worse than WITHOUT A CLUE 1988, a slapstick farce of a swapped identity.) In the face of that the old trick fails to avail for the second time, the ace is that a gay-implied two-player eclipses all the rest of the film (I cannot bring to my mind what's the scheme of Moriaty in a crystal clear detail), and the bickering between these two lovebirds is the thing in its own favor. Against all odds, it's a relief that Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma persists although barely enough to satisfy his loyal audience, and a dramatically emotional twist also propels the film to an overall mediocre level near the very end, Jude Law also has no need to curb his 'innocent- looking' acting skills, which may be a stretch for him after turning 40. What is totally in dismay is the female characters, apart from Rachel McAdams' opening cameo, The original rising star from THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Noomi Rapace's Hollywood debut is awkwardly plain, an insignificant and tawdry Gypsy girl, to be sidelined without any glamor, god bless her in the upcoming PROMETHEUS 2012.",6,1,1,10 January 2012
The Monuments Men," disappointing!
","It is a bummer when 20th Century Fox rescheduled Clooney's fifth director endeavor THE MONUMENTS MEN into a lukewarm February release, bodes ill for its craftsmanship which may not up to Oscar's caliber. But gaging from its stellar cast, a more probable upshot could be a fun-loving teamwork like OCEAN 11-13 fanfare, yet, it does't even achieve this lesser goal. The film is hit or miss in coagulate its plain script with an aimlessly disorganized narrative, even during its climax it feels lagging and insipid. Obviously the execution is at a loss to define the picture's overall temperament, a war drama, or a lightweight comedy, or an ensemble piece of entertainment, it seems that Clooney wants to blend them altogether, but it boomerangs badly, it eventuates to be an ungainly nondescript, only if art cognoscenti can generate some faint buzz over the looted art treasures and groan what a trespass conducted by the execrable Nazis. In the mid-1940s, a USA task force constituted by art experts and led by Clooney enters behind the enemy line to aim to retrieve millions of pillaged art pieces from the retreating German troops as many as possible, some of which are historic and significant. Yet, the story unfolds heedlessly, and even it is near the end of WWII, casualties are still indispensable, lives can be dispatched all in a sudden, but overall one tends not to care too much since the brains behind the film don't allow anyone to invest a deluge of emotional turbulence in it as a consequence of its wooden presentation of the historical matter and whimsically evasive editing choices. Nothing too much can be commented on the cast although Blanchett can be perpetually singled out in any films she is in, among the Monuments Men, Murray and Balaban are borderline enjoyable, Goodman, Dujardin and Bonneville are half-heartedly dutiful, Damon and Clooney are just playing house in the war zone. It is an 118-minute paean to the importance of preserving art, we get it, just a reminder, stopping bombarding is a nice precaution to this purpose, take that, all the radical militarists!",4,1,1,31 May 2014

It starts as a gender-swapping yarn in the present day, Mitsuha, a motherless high school girl from a mountainous region, who lives with her grandma and a younger sister in their family shrine whereas her estranged father is running for the mayor of the town, grouses about her stagnant rural life and dreams of being a boy living in the big city, when a mysterious comet strikes across the firmament, it seems her wish is granted, she wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo, and vice versa, the swapping alternates on a daily basis and rebounds to both despite the initial confusion and the side effect of fading memories, Mitsuha becomes popular in the school with Taki takes over her body whilst Miki, the co-worker whom Taki has a crush on, starts to feel closer to him thanks to Mitsuha's feminine intervention. Laden with generic but scintillating humor (Mitsuha's habitual gazing and fondling of her boobs when her body is inhabited by Taki, but ostensibly not the other way around), zippy editing rhythm and hooky J-Pop anthems, the chucklesome paragraph reaches a halt when one day, Taki finds out that the swapping stops, and what follows are his dogged endeavor to looking for Mitsuha's village whose name eludes him with a bolt from the blue waiting down the line. Apparently and inexplicably, their temporalities are not uniform, but separated by three years, and Shinkai's savvy script circumspectly introduces the time-warp into the plot, which evolves into a touching and urgent past-changing undertaking for Mitsuha, facilitated by the numinous power of the traditional mouth-chewed sake and interlaced with a transcendent vis-√É¬†-vis in the twilight hour during which the two nearly have time to write down their names. The cataclysm cannot be averted but at least many lives are saved, yet, hampered by the fading memories of each other's names, will they be reunited in the same universe? You bet! Although the ending has a strained elation blatantly turning a blind on the odds of two individuals actually pass by each other randomly in a metropolis like Tokyo. Shinkai's virtuosity of devising picturesque scenery is an extraordinary feat to be reckoned with, a spate of celestial splendor and awe-inspiring landscape are scenery porn to hungry eyes, sometimes spiffed up by flashy juxtapositions of memories and hand-written sketches. Nevertheless, being someone who hasn't been versed in the realm of anime, one might wantonly hazard that the human character is a weak link in the process, their looks are invariably pedestrian and shy of memorable distinctions, perhaps it is an intrinsic defect in the animation where the niceties of facial expressions are still quite a challenge to visualize in technique terms. However, nothing can deny that YOUR NAME is a massive success and an infallible testimony of Shinkai's faculty to carry on the anime torch from royalties like Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.",8,3,5,4 August 2017
Captain Phillips," a mainstream production from the Hollywood assembly line
","A Hollywood-produced, politically correct, big studio vehicle, helmed by a world-class action artisan Paul Greengrass, stars the most revered actor of his generation, Tom Hanks as the titular captain, whose screen image is a paragon of an orthodox ordinary Joe alike American hero, in this seafaring hijack inspired by a true event in 2009 at Somali waters. It is a retaliation of the vicious circle from the poverty-stricken to the hegemony which sardonically offers them the alms and simultaneously capitalizes on their natural resources and weaponry merchandising, so it is not easy to hold a phlegmatic perspective to watch the man-made terror without deploring the sad truth how things have ended up like this, for sure we should inveigh against the piracy felony, all the same we should also see through the phenomena and ferret out the nitty-gritty which induces the atrocious tragedies. We have both parties to blame and need a soul-searching examination on our own conscience. Greengrass adopts an engaging procedure to re-enact the white-knuckle happening of how the ship is seized by four Somali pirates (leading by a scrawny Muse, played by the first-time actor, now Oscar-nominee Abdi), parallels the narrative from both sides, playing mind games and a hide-and-seek inside the vessel, this is the first half, culminated with the pirates take captain Phillips as the hostage in a lifeboat, floating back the Somali. Apparently from the hindsight, it is a preventable incident, considering it is a US cargo ship, no one on board is equipped with any firearms at all? From a gun frenzy country where campus shooting is rampant, it is quite implausible, but sometimes the truth is as simple as that, the pirates' boarding process is rough and ready, clearly the affluent corporate which owns the ship skimps on its defense system, although they are fully aware of the potential peril could happen anytime. Otherwise, there would be no big deal to defeat four sea marauders (one is barely a child) even they're equipped with AK-18.Anyway, the second half, Captain Phillips is held captive within a lifeboat with the pirates on the billowy sea, since then, the film heavily hinges on Hank's performance to emanate the brewing desperation during the so-called 'negotiation' between US rescue team (SEAL, frogmen are all standby) and the cornered pirates four. It is a precious platform to let Hanks finally have something extraordinary to offer, he completes it with consummate precision and sublimates the predictable fallout of the false hope. Unfortunately due to a crammed year with sterling candidates, Hanks is left out of the nomination list, quite an upsetting snub, but he plays a real person who lacks for a distinctive character except he is under an extreme situation, not showy enough is the detrimental disadvantage. Abdi is the MVP among the pirates four, not as irritable and impatient as the hackneyed short-fuse Najee (Ahmed), he is a human being with flesh and blood, he is the one captain Phillips can relate to under such circumstances, all diversities aside, basically they both work for their respective bosses and want to finish their jobs with minimal casualties. His bold final move can be interpreted as a smart judgment call, his American dream ironically fulfills in a different way, at least he can be plumb free of his ill-destined fate. Nominated for 6 Oscars including BEST PICTURE (both Hanks and Greengrass are brutally snubbed here), CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is at best an unbiased recount of a man's individual struggle during a hanging-by-a-thread ride, and at worst, it is an unimaginative hostage story with jejune perpetrators wield weapons and demand unrealistic ransom, no one can beat the principled USS army, do you get the message?",7,0,0,29 January 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The heart-touching story of a boy's first high school year
","It is not quite often a book author can direct a film adapted from his own novel, but Stephen Chbosky did it with this partially autobiographic story about a high school freshman Charlie (Lerman), gains love and friendship during the first year with his soon-to-be-graduated senior schoolmates. Charlie is from a conventional Catholic family (McDermott and Walsh as his parents), ever since the beginning, Chbosky never cease to cue us that there are some lurking secrets of his past experience, and during the middle point, we knows his best friend committed suicide one year ago, yet, it is not the whole story, there is something more insidious and unspeakable hidden beneath, up till the very end, viewers will promptly get the truth out of the patchwork of its flashback sequences and it is a subdued strategy to present the truth in a way does not feel out of the place with the main plot line. Instead of exploiting the shock value, Chbosky exerts his great effort to explore the heartfelt emotional pizazz of Charlie's blossoming first love with his senior schoolmate Sam (Watson), and how he acquire not only true love but also genuine friendship in the coterie lead by Sam and her step-brother Patrick (Miller). In a slow-burning but invigorating narrative, the film tread the same water of a high-schooler's bittersweet life, but thanks to the superb cast, namely the three main young actors, their candid feelings are immensely palpable, Lerman is definitely too cute to be overlooked as a wallflower, but his intent gaze and compelling sensibility is heart-meltingly inviting us to Charlie's wounded heart. Her first acting role after HARRY POTTER franchise, Emma Watson builds a fetching character as the pretty girl with a puzzled mind for her future, convincingly acts on her American accent, she never lose the spotlight whenever she in on the screen, even though her character's flair possibly is undermined by her supportive function both as a girl with poor taste in men and a kindred spirit Charlie can wholeheartedly relate with due to his own dark secret. Ezra Miller, afresh from WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011, 8/10), imbues an utterly contrasted performance here, idiosyncratic but full of sincerity, briskly jolly and playful, although his miserable gay relationship drains off his effervescence to some degree, his THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (1975, 8/10) lip-syncing impersonation is pungently enthralling and the two faces of Patrick's plight stand up as a cogent subplot which concretes the POV of our modern day relationship, we are confidently blinded by our own perception of love, in a pathological masochism. The mix-tapes gambits are really welcoming and put into a better use here as a teen spirit for youngsters in the 90s, and the film is a beacon of an examination of the mindset of adolescence in USA, really well done with its unforced delivery and all the bells and whistles never drag the main theme out of the sight, the family is united in the end, even the adults are all more realistically portrayed without any default vice to sabotage the authentic tonality, save one key plot device, the underused Melanie Lynskey. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER almost cracks into my top 10 films of the year, and Stephen Chbosky is very skillful in transform his subject matter onto another media, but for the three brilliant young players, they deserve more kudos because their performances are all in Oscar caliber!",8,0,1,15 September 2014
The Equalizer," Washington challenges Liam Neeson's senior action flick
","A recent cinema-going of Denzel Washington's latest thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, the man behind his Oscar-crowning good-cop-goes-bad turn in TRAINING DAY (2001, 8/10). But that is only a one-off bait for his Oscar consummation. As one of the most consistently bankable actor in Hollywood (at least in the domestic market), Washington's good-man card never fail his audience, bar his sortie in portraying an ambiguous character as a drunken pilot garners him another Oscar-nomination in Robert Zemeckis' FLIGHT (2012, 7/10). So this reunion is more or less commercial-oriented than an ambitious art-house attempt as Fuqua has established his status as the Hollywood go-to action journeyman after producing profitable outputs like SHOOTER (2007) and OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013). The plot is a derivative individual heroism boosting fare, Washington is Robert McCall, a former government agent, now lives alone in Boston as an ordinary employee in the Home Mart hardware store. His quiet life is disrupted when he bonds with a young hooker Teri (Moretz), who is in the throes of a brutal Russian gangsters, after Teri being violently beaten by her pimp Slavi (Meunier), Robert decides to save her from the business, but instead, he swiftly kills him and his minions. Subsequently he determines to single-handedly takes on the entire gang, lead by the merciless enforcer Teddy (Csokas), as well as the big boss Pushin (Kulich) in Moscow. It sounds Liam Neeson has some serious competition in the sub-genre of twilight badass actioner, but unlike Neeson's family man Bryan Mills in TAKEN franchise, Robert has no such liability, he is purely a righteous vigilante, a Black version of the Punisher, lynches low-life scumbags where legal law force fails to execute, indeed near the end, he even accepts request from Craiglist (a sequel is already being announced). Although it is impossible to swallow the concept of the protagonist can spectrally annihilate a whole mob by himself (with a little help from his amiable Hispanic friend) without sensing the off-putting whiff of propagandizing Hollywood's individualism, Fuqua manages to glaze the film with a Neo-noir patina in a steady pace to accentuate his aesthetic demanding and stylish cinematography; in lieu of resorting to ostentatious action stunts (surprisingly comforting there is no car-chasing sequences at all), Fuqua actually is patient enough to allow Robert's situation and his struggle being cogently formulated before he turns into an invincible executioner of justice and starts his fulfilling mission of killing. It is an entertaining movie, sometimes too violent for common taste, but sharply hits the bulls- eye for its target audience. Its ultimate depot confrontation calls to mind a darker and more lethal upgrade of HOME ALONE gimmick, and the face-off between Robert and Teddy is unexpectedly anti-climatic. Washington is so comfy in his wheelhouse and can feasibly pull off the platonic friendship between him and Moretz without any May-December suggestion. The perpetually Russell Crowe dead ringer Marton Csokas finally gets a bigger part as the gentleman-looking but beast-inside killer, it is the best offer Hollywood can ever offer to him, it is also a timely wake-up call to reconsider his career options, maybe a romantic comedy for a change.",6,1,6,6 October 2014
Source Code," Source Code
","Train now becomes a sensitive hot topic in China due to the 7.23 train-wreck accident at Wenzhou, and this film fitly offers an effectual resolution to prevent (or forestall) the tragedy, which causes an 8-minutes-save-the-world mission accomplished by a high-tech novelty called 'Source Code'. Duncan Jones is sturdily paving his way for a further advancement as a new gifted director after his universally-acclaimed indie debut MOON (2009). Although SOURCE CODE, carrying a modest budget this time, Duncan's mainstream breakthrough explores again in the sci-fi genre and successfully generates a palpable solution to satisfy as much audience as possible and meanwhile maintains his auteurism among his devoted followers, from which aspect, Source Code is a decent victory. Both MOON and SOURCE CODE share a similar monochrome circumstance, claustrophobic suffocation, and deal with a straightforward trajectory of the evolution of technology (clones or time-reset mission), for me, it is not important all the happenings make sense or not, what I admire Duncan is his ability to water down the sophisticated elucidation in a range where could be digested by main population without tainting its emotional seesaw. One minor side affect is using too much platitude for the residual elements (the would-be Chicago nuclear-bomb attack looks like a tawdry joke and the ignition of love for Michelle Monaghan is evocatively banal, not to mention the ubiquitous father issue). Jake Gyllenhaal thoroughly reflexes a multi-facet impersonation as the leading role, which inevitably widens his territory and capacity. His maturity and aplomb will grant him a brighter future, which will not be so far-fetched. All the supporting cast is mainly curbed in their restricted field, Michelle and Jeffrey Wright are merely using their stock-in-trade, however the versatile Vera Farmiga's contribution is worthy of an official accolade, she magically endows a corny and stereotyped role with an empathetic credibility, even marginalizes the plot hole to a certain extent (originally I cannot understand why she risks her career just for the sake of some 'emotional' brain wave, maybe this is the most mysterious part). Finally, a big congratulation to Duncan Jones again (the first one is for MOON two years age) and I think in the near future, lesser and lesser will call him the son of David Bowie, and I wish he could astonish the world of cinema with his own free will, which is a golden mine still underdeveloped.",8,1,1,31 July 2011
Skyfall," Skyfall
","After CASINO ROYALE (2006, 7/10); QUANTUM OF SOLACE (2008, 7/10), Daniel Craig's resurrection as James Bond arrives in its 3rd round, with Winslet's ex-hubby Sam Mendes holding the director's reins, the film surpasses my presumption to a great extent, not the least with a sterling cinematography achievement from Roger Deakins. The film kick-starts in Istanbul, a fresh deja-vu of Liam Neeson's TAKEN 2 (2012, 5/10) is the knee-jerking response, however, the subsequent train chase action is the bona fide climax. Adele's theme song comes next, a complete mind-blower (I listened the song for the first time) and visually it reminds me of Karen O's Immigrant Song, the eye-popping opening tune of Fincher's THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011, 8/10, stars Daniel Craig as well). The sleek and phenomenal night view of a metropolitan Shanghai is both reminiscent and dear to me (only if the crew could have tapped more into it), and for globetrotters, Bond's journey will never get bored, later on an exotic (but quite artificial) Macao and a godforsaken ghost island will satisfy all the western passengers before things return to London and eventually a surprising showdown at Scotland (the titular Skyfall lodge) Bond's childhood home, the foggy and dreamlike settings are in the perfect sense under Deakins' haunting shots, the atmosphere is deadly artistic yet gripping. Apart from the digital visual stunts, the film opts to a more detailed revenge route for its (commonly) stereotyped villain and invests more time in Judi Dench's swan song of M, whose superior-subordinate/mother-son affinities with Bond, this time it is not about saving the world, it is a pure and simple vengeance game. Daniel Craig is still the indomitable Bond, steely but less refined, but the scene stealers here are definitely Dame Judi Dench and the maniac ex-MI6 agent Javier Bardem. The truth is Dench is the real 'bond girl' in this episode, who dominates a protracted screen-time (only second to Bond), since we all aware that it is the last time to see her in this recurrent role, the film has kindly proffered her some Academy-worthy moments (the poem-citing scene in the court for example), to accent on poising herself with integrity and professional pride for the country she serves while exuding a bit testimony as a human flesh with very subtle but emotional unsettlement. Although I am not on board with M's denouement in the film (too banal compared with other revolutionary merits injected in the reboot of the franchise), Dench and her team behind definitely should champion hard for a seat in the next Oscar race. So could be said to Bardem, but he is much like a long-shot since formulaic villains in the franchise films are principally snubbed by the voting members, Bardem delivers an awe- inspiring performance, period. New bond girl B√©r√©nice Marlohe has scant time but it may conform to the saying 'less is better'as long as her mission has been convincingly accomplished. Fiennes' role is dooming to be more meaty next time and Harris is just another girl can serious kick someone's ass.I do hope SKYFALL will find more endorsement in the academic field, where in the history of 50 years, James Bond and his makers have never been taken seriously, and the time finally comes when some curse must be broken.",8,2,10,7 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3
","Arriving before its North American landing, IRON MAN 3 pulls off a momentous debuting in its international market, I saw it in a plain 2D version and, about this franchise, IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) is a left field coup, a middle-aged superhero to clinch the youth-dominated market, only Robert Downey Jr. could nail it with dapper openness and wisecracking debonair. So within six years span, a fourth cranked-out (if one counts THE AVENGERS 2012, 5/10) comes on strong this year to ignite the summer powder keg. Personally I skipped IRON MAN 2 (2010) though I still possess the DVD, and the only reason why IRON MAN 3 interests me is the Chinese element, reportedly three Chinese actors are on the slate of the cast, Xueqi Wang, Bingbing Fan and Jing Wu, but it turned out to be an utter scam, only Xueqi Wang appeared in about 3 seconds in 2 fleeting scenes with one line 'Nihao' ('hello' in Mandarin) and so is Ben Kingsley's 'The Mandarin', the ostensible ringleader of the terrorists (more Al-Qaeda than mandarin). So what this new episode has offered to its devoted fanboys apart from the cookie-cutter template of the mega-Superhero action flicker? Since there are no succour from his fellow The Shields' teammates, Iron Man 3 perfunctorily opts to mass-produce the iron-clad robots to rescue the world (perish the undying human mutants), a lame and opportunist move to simplify the mess it creates and spurn any logistic plausibility (at least notify us how to kill mutants for good since they can regenerate themselves under any terms of damage), not to mention the cliffhanging twist of Pepper Potts, maybe it is all written in the next sequel. Fans will never get enough of raking and levelling, it is undeniable that the demolition of Stark's mansion is visually stunning and apocalyptic, and the esprit-de-corps of the plane-wrecking rescue is also worth the wait (thanks to the telltale trailer), but in the end, the inevitable face-off is a kill-joy, compared with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012, 8/10), IRON MAN 3 looks as feckless as a light-hearted comedy, and its success can mainly be indebted towards Mr. Downey's omnipotent appeal, a rakish fop who owns everything and is sternly faithful to his partner (although a certain degree of promiscuity is a requisite), and more alluring, he can create superheroes. Paltrow has more action sequences demanding out of her gaunt physique, and also shoulders a turnabout climax in the end, but still a trophy secretary-lover. Guy Pearce is a common-or- garden villain here (not as remotely interesting as in LAWLESS 2011, 8/10 last year), Ben Kinsley on the other hand, is the comic relief (besides Tony Stark) here, wackily inconsequential but a timely buffer from the intensified situation. Don Cheadle is ham-fisted as the other iron fighter and Rebecca Hall does evince cursory nuances for her expendable character. Among others, James Badge Dale (from SHAME 2011, 9/10 and FLIGHT 2012, 7/10) finally found his stepping- stone into mainstream showbiz, his indestructible henchman even makes his boss pale in comparison. A puff of fresher air comes from the interaction between Stark and a fatherless boy (Ty Simpkins) at a rustic Tennessee setting, with jocular ripostes and a paternal bond affectingly enriches Tony Stark's personality and one plainly wishes this part would be more to offer. However, as the turnover rate has been accelerated dramatically these years in the superhero assembly-line, IRON MAN 3 is a serviceable vehicle to appease its core audience's anticipation, and if put into a larger picture, it is not innovate enough to be a game-changer as its prototype, it is just another helluva sequel, trite but lucrative. But it will be a sad sack if Mr. Downey keeps churning out the persona into his fifties, it could be a grand farewell for the trilogy, and future cameos are warmly welcome.",6,2,5,30 April 2013
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," a top-notch industrial adventure
","Robert Zemeckis' fifth feature movie at the heel of the phenomenal BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985), WHO FRAMED RABBIT ROGER is an enormously entertaining amalgamation of live-action and traditional 2D animation, unprecedentedly assembles a plethora of cartoon characters from both Disney and Warner Bros. stocks. A none-too-mind-boggling whodunit in 1940s Hollywood where human society co-exists with a toon world. Rabbit Roger (voiced by Fleischer) is a name toon star who is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme (Kaye, in his silver-screen swan song), the mogul of Acme Corporation, and a human private eye Eddie Valiant (Hoskins), whose past tragic brush with the toon world still rankles, is dragged into the scramble to shake thing up, scupper a deleterious scheme of the evil Judge Doom's (Lloyd), settle the old score and finally he and Rabbit Roger establish a mutually respected bond between humans and toons. Decades later, the picture still looks pristinely stunning, a seamless coalescence of the 3- dimensional real world with the 2-D fantasy inspires great immediacy and fun, in both scenarios where Eddie is thrown into the toon-land or the other way around, toons wandering in the Hollywood lot or engaging a car-chasing in the street of L.A.. A petulant Hoskins is quite gung-ho in acting in front of a green-screen, and Lloyd is a palatable villain with cardboard identity and a cunning plan which is too prescient to be sardonic. A shrewd revelation of the villain is the victims' very own kind, would spawn different reactions from various projects, on the negative side, Frank Oz's god-awful THE STEPFORD WIFE (2004) brings to mind, but here, it can easily bypass any unwarranted hard feelings as who gives a fig about what a fruitcake toon thinks. The main cartoon characters are tailor-made to defer to the lowest common denominator - a kid's talkie, Rabbit Roger comes off as irritably garrulous, and his pleading of 'toons are made to bring laughter' rings hollow since it fails to connect with today's reality, as we have been constantly assured and re-assured that animated works can do a whole lot more than cheap pratfalls and belabored jokes; the overtly risqu√É¬© image of his wife Jessica (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner) shows the industry really doesn't mind pigeonholing female characters into wishful- thinking love interests with inherent crassness, which is also confirmed by the one-note girlfriend role from Joanna Cassidy. On a larger scale, the movie's overwhelming success has at least partially sparkled a rekindled mass appreciation of the studio animation, which in the decades to come, has been prevailing over the global market henceforth, a throwaway question mark arises, nevertheless, how come a sure- fire sequel has yet to be green-lit regarding that the innovation in the animation department has already gone through a sea change, certainly, its appeal would exceed those live action performance-capturing ventures Zemeckis has consistently but unfruitfully experimented thrice in THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004), BEOWULF (2007) and A Christmas CAROL (2009).",7,1,1,5 December 2016
Chinatown," Best Polanski? Yes, you bet!
","Polanski's cynical noir-ish tale, CHINATOWN forces himself to retread the sad place of Los Angeles, where her pregnant wife Sharon Tate (along with several other friends) was brutally murdered in 1969. Ever so unfalteringly, he sticks to his guns, renders the whodunit mystery with an unadulterated tragic ending, as an acerbic retort to a patriarch society inundated with dyed-in- the-wool corruption both morally and economically, in memory of those innocently victimised.J.J. Gittes (Nicholson), a copper-turned-private-eye, is swindled to investigate the hanky-panky of Hollis Mulwray (Zwerling), the chief engineer of L.A. Department of Water and Power, will soon discover something much bigger and sinister than that, after Hollis' sudden death and the involvement of Hollis' wife Evelyn (Dunaway), Gittes is intrigued to unearth the truth, which also implicates Evelyn's father Noah Cross (Huston), a magnate once was the business partner of Hollis. But, sometimes, human vice is so unspeakable and rotten-to-the-core, having almost lost his nose, Gittes would finally realise that he is still wet behind the ears in his profession, his heroic act seems astute and intrepid, but in the end of the day, it can not tip the scale, like his unspecified past in Chinatown, where he was an officer of the law, he again miserably fails to save the good and innocent from the hands of death and evil. The soul-shattering upshot is a rarely seen defiance in the mainstream cinema where a director holds sway of the final say, and its aftershock hangs around, that's why CHINATOWN is so unique and groundbreaking.Uniformly, the film is hailed as one of the finest productions out of Hollywood, Robert Towne's Oscar-winning script delineates a conspiracy theory based on the true story which grants the story a tangible relevance, but also dives into a more personal matter of shocking taboo, to establish cinema is really a voyeuristic projector of all the dirty corners in our universe, A minor bellyaching is that, Gittes' function in the plot feels somewhat contrived, if Noah is so intent on locating what he is looking for, why on earth he would leave Evelyn out of his sight? Which is only for the benefit of storytelling that Gittes can always precede everyone else, he remains the sole source to tell audience what is the truth, that's something may or may not bother you.There are plenty of memorable shots with distinctive flair, whether it is shot from a telescope lens, or a rearview mirror, the camera extends as a furtive, ambiguous onlooker with no further engagement, brooding and spying. Jerry Goldsmith's iconic score (made only in 10 days) lures viewers into that vintage era and then entraps them in the melancholy, suspense and thrill.Nicholson's Gittes, who appears so competent and sharp-witted most of the time, conceals the star's smug persona and conveys a engaging commitment of the happening as the plot thickens, one of my personal favourite performance from him, simply because one literally sympathises for his vulnerability and powerlessness when he is held to face the bleak music; Dunaway, whose inscrutable mien reveals a little bit of something, each time her Evelyn comes under the spotlight, is she a femme fatale? a partner-in-crime? an insider? or just a victim? She keeps her secrecy until the big moment, the astonishing no-sham-slapping spectacles, what can one say? It just blows you away, both the revelation and the two-hander.John Huston, perhaps in his most well-known role in front of a camera, leaves an indelible impression as a seemingly harmless wealthy old man, but actually is a metaphor of what is sickly wrong in our modern society, self-seeking, double-faced, incestuous, callous, unrepentant, with an unhealthy attachment of his own bloodline, a high-profile addition along with the two excellent leads.In all frankness, normally, the blunt exploitation of woman as an easy prey is a big turn-down for my taste, but in this case, Polanski's free pass is too big to fail and the film survives as his most renowned work ever since.",9,5,10,26 June 2016
Rocketman," ROCKETMAN is shy of reaching the goal it aims at albeit hitting all the right notes
","Dexter Fletcher's jukebox biopic about British national treasure Elton John, n√© Reginald Dwight, ROCKETMAN touches all the right notes: Taron Egerton wonderfully shows off his vocal range and re-records John's hits with assertion; it doesn't skip John's queer sexuality like what they have done to Freddie Mercury in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY (2018) and faithfully reproduces John's flamboyant outfits to bedazzling potency; plus an imprimatur from the singer/song-writer himself, a rare holdover surviving the inimical double influences from alcoholism and drug abuse, the blas√© trimmings of showbiz stardom, and for that matter, the film indeeds commences with John, in his devil-with-horns attire ablaze, strutting into one of the addiction rehabilitation meetings, eagerly relates his own redemptive tale from the very start.Flashback from his early days, to his smooth sailing to fame and then its heavy tolls are welded with John's signature songs, Lee Hall's script mainly attributes his success to his inborn talent (a distinguished retention of strains, a natural pianist with no difficulty of churning out hit numbers) and good luck - roundly hitting it off with his long-time collaborator....keep reading my review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8,1,1,14 October 2019
Gravity," Gravity - Wow!
","Travel in India, but I will never miss any chance to experience a cinema-going activity in any exotic locale, not to mention it is Alfonso Cuar√≥n's GRAVITY, the sensationally topical follow-up to CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10), a firmly prospective Oscar-bait and is on its way to procure an unanimous triumph from both audiences and critics, domestically and internationally, a rare feat which is hailed as the most innovative film in executing the ubiquitous 3D technology after AVATAR (2009, 9/10). I was at a relatively large 3D screen hall, but if you can find a screen with IMAX plus 3D, which is the quintessential option. The film runs a succinct 96-minutes, at first I found myself a bit distracted by the murkiness of the screen with the clumsy 3D glasses double-glazing my myopic spectacles, one primary reason why I don't enjoy 3D films on the whole, so as to I didn't quite adjust myself to appreciate the opening scene, thankfully a belated captivation comes when the debris attacks, this survival tale begins to gnaw at its audience in a very good and exciting way. Floating in the infinite emptiness, the extremity of terror and helplessness is oppressive and overwhelming, Sandra Bullock confidently and believably pilots us into a journey of wonders, we don't know what's the odds here for her to pull it off the miraculous landing on earth, it is her relentless mettle and stamina shock us, inspire us and strike a chord with us. Bullock's hallmark of underplaying her character's choppy emotion does a clean sweep to deliver a top-notch impact in spite of a comparatively thin script, it is a tour-de-force performance in her career and a hard-earned honor for an actress who can overcome the glass ceiling to lead a commercially prosperous Sci-Fi fare in her age (what's more important, she is also a top-billing comedian presently). Clooney serves slickly as the experienced but not-too-lucky astronaut, most of the time he is hidden inside the space helmet and uniform, but generates a wake-up call on the nose when he displays his usual Clooney-esque mien, Cuar√≥n does know what audiences want. GRAVITY is a ground-breaker, a high-tech adventurer and seeker, and fingers crossed it will eventually give DP Emmanuel Lubezki his overdue golden statue after 5 nominations (divinely shot scenes include the trademark ever-rotating long takes, the resurrection emblem of a fetus inside the uterus, the final victory when she rises out of the sea as a giantess, etc.), maybe for Cuar√≥n and his sterling production team as well (sound department, art production and visual stunt). It is a film beyond everyone's imagination and it edifies you so much with so little to tell, like an essay, it is concise but cogent, and with a collateral effect to blow your mind.

To Be or Not to Be," A double bill review with Mel Brooks' remake
","An enthralling and ebullient double bill of two versions of TO BE OR NOT TO BE, Lubitsch's Black & White masterpiece, also famous for being Carole Lombard's swan song before a plane crash brought her away from this world at the prime age of 33, and Mel Brooks' (almost) faithful color remade (although the director title falls on the head of his longtime collaborator Alan Johnson) starring him and his wife Ms. Bancroft. It is the same story being transcribed under two different palettes, the remake owes its tongue-in-cheek drollness greatly to the screenwriter Edwin Justus Mayer of the 1942 version since many one-liners are copied verbatim, both versions are abounding with witty caricatures of Hitler and his Nazi regime, embellishes a tall order in the wartime Warsaw with conspicuous burlesque, a Polish acting troupe's collective endeavour to hunt down a German spy and a subsequent flee from war zone to England, during which a crucial tool is that our hero, the ham actor Joseph Tura (Benny) / Frederick Bronski (Brooks), has to playact different characters, from the spy professor, a Nazi colonel and even Hitler himself (in the remake), to bluff his way out; meanwhile he is also vexed by the budding romance between his actor wife Maria (Lombard) / Anna (Bancroft) and a young aviator Lt. Sobieski (Stack) / Lt. Sobinski (Matheson). But there are also apparent differences which can bear out why Lubitsch's original is a much better piece of work, taking the opening sequences for example, Lubitsch starts with a voice-over narrating an unusual happening in Warsaw before WWII, Adolf Hitler is spotted on the street, then a following revelation reveals that it is after all an act, Hitler is played by a character actor who tries to test his resemblance by walking among the mass, what a pleasant surprise! But in the remake, Mel Brooks doesn't adopt this route, instead, he opens with a vaudeville number SWEET GEORGIA BROWN with Bancroft, a fairly impressive stunt but fails to match Lubitsch's ingenious gambit, later audience will discover, one main reason behind this alteration is that there is no role of the character actor who resembles Hitler in this version, as Brooks himself will disguise as Hitler in the final escape scam, so probably it is a sacrifice to fulfil Brooks' own ego to enlarge his part as the star.For most part, the silver-screen magnetism of the original is beguilingly outstrips the remake's more mundane touch, and being a well-intended fairytale, the mundane touch is unfortunately an impediment particularly in the elongated escape plan, the entire operation feels preposterous with the all the chase (don't let me start on the doggie Mutki's eleventh- hour jump) and what happens to the real Hitler in the theatre, he doesn't feel absurd when clearly no actors are on the stage to perform? In the original, this passage is fast-paced with a whimsical take of the fake Hitler ordering two pilots to jump off the plane without parachutes, to mock Nazi's blind obedience.With all my respect to Brooks and Bancroft, but in the remake, they are just too old for their roles, egregiously jarring is Brooks as young Hamlet in his ridicule titular monologue, seriously? I don't consider myself as an ageist, but this is more than a farce to swallow. Bancroft is two-and-a-half decades past her prime as a seductress in THE GRADUATE (1967, 8/10), her comedic bent can never pass beyond the slinky postures. OK. we get it, it is a family business, let the profit kept within one's own turf. However, a big thumb-up for the remake to introduce an openly gay character Sasha (Haake), Anna's dresser, into the plot, in order to carry through the side-splitting wisecrack 'how can a theatre survive without Jews, gays and gypsies?'. Also Charles Durning usurps an Oscar-nomination for the remake as Col. Erhardt, but having watched the original first, his farcical rendition feels a shade forced compared with Sig Ruman's effortless spontaneity.In the original, the Lombard-and-Benny pair forms a more organic liaison thanks a lot to the retro flair, she is a classic lady with glamour and dignity, he is somewhat childlike but self- consciously over-proud of his acting, their bickering is crammed with spark and tease, even Robert Stack's handsome pilot is dreamier in the vintage silhouette. All in all, it might be unfair for the remake to be viewed immediately after the original, but also the double-bill viewing is a telling corroboration of why vintage classics can obtain their timeless appeal, nostalgia aside, they are absolutely one-of-a-kind in their visual tactility, their characters' mannerism and the streamlined narrative tactics, if you are into it, you cannot get enough of it, as for the remake, maybe it is just not vintage enough, nothing we can do about that, as least for now.",8,0,2,1 June 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Life Of Brian
","My first film with the entire crew from Monty Python (their third feature-length film), whilst I count out Terry Gilliam's TIME BANDITS (1981, a 7/10), which is sort of a post-break-up solo activity (in spite of Cleese and Palin's participation). What can I say? Due to the cultural disparity, comedy maybe the most possible film genre which is predisposed to feel outdated, especially for those from non-native audience. I could only squeeze some scattered laughter to cater for the film, which is a parody of the life of Jesus Christ grafted in a mistaken Messiah with a hotchpotch of haphazard mess and ridicule.Maybe the film should have a default setting for its viewers, because being an agnostic, I could hardly get the film, thus there is a possibility if one acquires more religious backdrops, there is a chance he or she could appreciate it more. Also it is a perplexing question mark in my mind, how could this film manages a 8.2 out of 10 rating and listed among top 250 in IMDb? (I had the same doubt when encountering THE PRINCESS BRIDE 1987, a 6/10). So back to the film itself, the acting is fairly passable (John Cleese and Michael Palin are hilarious in their deadpan performances, but the mis-pronunciation gags are a bit over- abused). Among all the intentional tricks, the paragraphs of pursuing the Messiah and Eric Idle's rib-tickling Loretta are my picks. It is no surprise this religious satire would provoke some blasphemy controversy, but the nerves and unconventionality are what should be admired, but if we separate the film from any context liaisons, the film is merely a modest farce, take the example of the ending, when the crucifixion scenes arrive, a sudden bathos ultimately reduces any putative knockout accompanied by the schmaltzy rendition of ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE (which I find enjoys a more suitable circumstances in AS GOOD AS IT GETS 1997).",6,1,7,9 June 2012
As Good as It Gets," As Good As It Gets
","James L. Brooks' mammoth flop HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) has again put his prestigious laurels of an Academy-winning director into a precipice, after his grotesquely mawkish SPANGLISH (2004), spanning his entire 30 years career, he has only directed 6 films so far, half of which are mediocre drosses (said two films plus I'LL DO ANYTHING 1994), lucky AS GOOD AS IT GETS is not among them, and has truly extracted the top form from its stars Oscar-winning stars and Verdell the little doggie. The 'impossible pair' setting is always a most common yet compelling stunt in a rom-com, while usually male plays a dominant part, and female part takes some moral advantage to keep the balance as equally as possible to avoid any sexism accusations. So in this storyline, Jack Nicholson's unmarried compulsive writer resembles Shelton Cooper from THE BIG BANG THEORY, maybe we could divine Shelton's senior life like that, his own routine cannot be breached and he maintains nonchalant towards the people and happenings around him, Helen Hunt's single-mother waitress with an ailed kid, has the worst case scenario at hand, but clearly is the best woman in the planet with all the carefully-embellished merits, could be even the muse for the destitute artist, which can be a smart move to get approve from the most of the female demography. Then a third factor is Greg Kinnear's gay artist, which may seem to be the weakest among the trinity, but as the representative perspective from the minority group, his mayhem serves as a more evocative agent to be viewed as the rosy prospect of gay right even in today's time. The performances are marvelous, for Nicholson, maybe not his career-best, but suffices all the accolade he received for his wacky but arresting antics, and his third Oscar win is fairly acceptable; Hunt is on the other hand, adding more intimate revelation and vigor to her ostensibly soppy role, I have no grudge towards her win (but my pick is still Helena Bonham Carter from THE WINS OF THE DOVE 1997); then Kinnear, whose career-best has emerged too fast and a comeback seems to be a rather long shot now. Virtually all the achievements should be owed to its script, very resourceful and operative, as for the director work, Mr. Brooks' journeyman dexterity has no mistakes but surely is not a novelty in this case.",7,0,1,5 June 2012

The Maze Runner," an engrossing YA adaptation
","Another YA adaptation gets the green light for a sequel this year, after Shailene Woodley's star-making vehicle DIVERGENT (2014, 6/10), although both are welterweights compared to THE HUNGER GAMES juggernaut as far as rate of return is concerned. THE MAZE RUNNER is unique in its claustrophobic single-location setting (considerably slims down the budget, an estimated $34 million set side by side with $85 million of DIVERGENT), 90% of time the youngsters (boys exclusively) are entrapped in a glade (so they are called gladers) with the only exit is a giant maze with jumbo cybernetic arthropods named Grievers preying them.One asset of the film is that it is utterly engrossing ever since the first scene, there is no conventional post-apocalyptic pretext. Audiences are catapulted to the strange place with our protagonist Thomas (O'Brien), whose memory is erased as those precedent gladers. Save that Thomas intermittently recollects some fragments of his memory with blurry and glitchy flashback sequences, the narrative closely clings to how he adapts a game-changer identity among the group with his agile movability, gallant actions and sharp judgment. Thankfully, it is not a lone hero scenario, the story rightfully homes in on the collective collaboration, with discordance looming around, and a ruthless body count which declares that some key members have no chance returning for the sequel.The action set pieces are not so frequent, but director Wes Ball consistently cashes in the mysterious surroundings to elevate an atmosphere approximate to an edge-of-the-seat thriller, although we are certain they will find a way out, nevertheless the curiosity is resided in the final revelation, who is the heartless mastermind behind-the-scene and why on earth these boys are treated like guinea pigs in a laboratory, for what purpose? The ending only moderately justifies our questions, and leaves a glaring plot-hole (how come Gally finds the way and the password to enter the lab anyway) which necessitates an explanation in the sequel.The young cast has done a crack job, O'Brien, Lee (as Minho), Brodie-Sangster (as Newt), Poulter (as Gally) and Cooper (as Chuck) are all sparklingly prominent in the male-bonding- or-clashing coterie, the only girl Teresa (Scodelario), is an awkward addition, rashly introduced in the middle stream, it is a blessing there is no romance lead to distract our attention, anyway, in a three-day span, it is plausible there is no room for that clich√©, but it is a sure thing the chemistry is bubbling under between Teresa and Thomas, and luckily we will wait for it in the second chapter.The movie fully taps into its formidable production design and as a whole it is neat and compelling without any eye-rolling bells and whistles (no nudity, mawkish love story or tangential ego-boosting blah-blah), a 2D version is a satisfactory pick for a Saturday matin√©e and I will say yes to the next chapter in 2015.",7,0,2,18 October 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," ROGUE ONE is a solid attempt to ginger up the jaded but still massively lucrative mega-universe of STAR WARS
","This stand-alone space opera, within the franchise's time-line it closely predates STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE (1977), and in some measure complements the whopping lacunae between Episode III and IV, individually, ROGUE ONE pluckily sidesteps the force-bestowed Skywalker clan and Jedi warriors, recounts a heroic stealth mission carried out by a band of rogue rebels, and rounds off the story with a pang of pathos which will alter our perspective of Episode IV forever. The plot zeroes in on Jyn Erso, played by a dauntless Felicity Jones, whose father Galen (Mikkelesen) is press-ganged into joining in the Empire as one of the core designers of the notorious Death Star. Jyn was separated from him when she was a little girl (where the franchise habitually kills off a mother figure, because Jane's mother Lyra, played by Valene Kane, inanely chooses to stick with her husband in lieu of her young child during the crunch, one cannot bow to her logic), now an adult, she is recruited by the Rebel Alliance on an expedition to look for Galen, accompanied by Cassian Andor (Luna) and his droid K-2SO (Tudyk), a great asset in the game. Little does Jyn know, the Rebel Alliance has an ax to grind, Cassian is commanded to dispatch her father once for all, even after Jyn gets the message delivered by a defected Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook (Ahmed), that Galen deliberately leaves a loophole in his design so that the humongous Death Star could be demolished from within. A father-daughter belated reunion doesn't end in a happy ending thanks to the expedient action of the rebels, yet, Jyn holds no grudge, pleads a motion to obtain the information of the loophole from the data bank in planet Scarif, which fails to pass the democratic consensus. So Jyn and Cassian, brave themselves to a kamikaze plan to snatch the data, disguised as Imperial officers, and transported by a stolen Imperial shuttle, they are joined by Bodhi, a blind Jedi-wannabe Chirrut Imwe (Yen, vaunting martial arts cannot save the day, alas) and his companion, the heavily-loaded mercenary Baze Malbus (Wen), among others.The rest is an ode to foot soldiers, we are certain they will get what they want in the end against a heavy casualty, but, we might not expect a total annihilation to wipe off the entire planet with our protagonists stranded helplessly to face the doom in a mode evocative of Lars van Trier's MELANCHOLIA (2011). That is where ROGUE ONE goes out on a limb to flout the so-called 'leading character aureole' and hits the mark, which dwarfs other franchises where body counts in the hero's roll calls must be fastidiously calculated, this is the advantage of an one-off project, as dumbstruck as that, it does effectively elicit a pungent whiff of pathos which is wanting from Han Solo's exit in STAR WARS EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015). Directer Gareth Edwards and DP Greig Fraser have done a creditable job in concretizing the film's intergalactic visual scope, collating a vintage milieu replete with rough-and-tumble where our ragbag of rebels constantly comes across with an ultra-streamlined modernity under the govern of the Empire. In its money-shots, two paralleled combats (one on the ground field, the other is the trademark space confrontation) merge into one helluva spectacle fairly retains the name of its brand, and for the most part, its 3D effect is unexpectedly lucid and arresting. Although John William's score is too reverent to override, Michael Giacchino's score manages to live up with the tale's heroic overtone. In the face of grave matters, scarcely a moment of romance can find a footing in the narrative, but a scintillating correlation between Jyn and Cassian has been tangibly established without hitting the sappy note thanks to a very contained effort from Jones and Luna. As for the highlight of the supporting group, apart from embracing diversity on a wider scale, everyone's talking point must be the graphic digital retouch to recreate several old characters in order to make a sound transition to the next chapter, notably Grand Moff Tarkin (which was played by the late Peter Cushing in Episode IV) and a young princess Leila, is it a sign to showcase that now the technology is able to bring previous characters back from oblivion to a new era? Or it could be a transgression of their indelible cinematic legacy? One might be dithering. Tellingly, ROGUE ONE is a solid attempt to ginger up the jaded but still massively lucrative mega- universe of STAR WARS, and could be more apt to be coined as a genuine suicide squad for its no- holds-barred gumption and forcefulness.",7,0,6,18 December 2016
Coraline," Coraline
","This Gothic animation feature comes from Henry Selick, the man who brought us THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (1993), which is frequently mistaken as Tim Burton's work (actually Burton is only the co-producer and co-writer, as a matter of fact, Burton directed his debut animation feature not until CORPSE BRIDE in 2005). The dark palette of our indomitable Coraline's fairytale distinguishes itself from other light- colored Hollywood cartoons interwoven with motley kids-friendly visualizations and vapidly didactic tone. Since the opening scene, my expectation of being thrilled had been hovering high, and I baldly assert that its audience's threshold age could be much older, which should had been a deadly challenge for a mainstream animation, nevertheless the film conquered its demographic range and gained a sprightly success in the box office and a nomination of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE in Oscar 2010. Speaking of the film itself, the 2-D character-designing deserves some standing ovation, the wackiness resides seamlessly inside each of them. Meanwhile the narrative reflects a deep empathy upon everyone's own grown-up issues, such as there is no unearned harvest in the world, never believe something which is too good to be true. The voice cast is superb, I even could not recognize it's Dakota Fanning if I had overlooked the opening credits and Teri Hatcher carries a nuisance between her two opposite roles as real mother Vs. evil mother. One little complain here, I am still not able to figure out the whole cause and effects of the evil mother's 'button-eye' plan, which lacks a plausible explanation for me to digest. Besides that, the film excels in every each way to be considered a successfully unorthodox innovator in its own category. P.S. The film reminds me of SPIRITED AWAY, another master piece from Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki.",8,0,1,27 April 2011
World War Z," A solid summer blockbuster
","World War ZLike gold dust, a hefty-invested blockbuster with a problematic partial re-filming (including a complete overhaul of the ending owing to its financial curb) and a procrastinated release date could actually trounce its foreboding karma and pans out to be a competent money-maker in the bloodthirsty summer season, not to mention has earned itself a sensational caption as ' the highest grossing film ever for the mega-star Brad Pitt'. Directed by Marc Forster (QUANTUM OF SOLACE 2008, 7/10; STRANGER THAN FICTION 2006, 7/10; STAY 2005, 8/10; FINDING NEVERLAND 2004, 7/10; MONSTER'S BALL 2001, 7/10), who is to some extent oscillating between a major company's hack and an accomplished auteur in the indiewood. WORLD WAR Z craftily grafts mind-blowing visual feasts onto an apocalyptic milieu with rapid-running zombies infected by unknown virus, and keep contaminating the residual humankind. The backstory sounds familiar but film constructs an alternative coda, not the hackneyed one-man-saves-the-world heroism, instead, it offers a more plausible expedient to both avoid the callow overkill and underscore the future with a bleaker hope for the story to continue. The film never stray from a standard zombiefest routine, but the execution is commendable, an indeed white-knuckle experience from A to Z, the process of this prerogative family's running away from a zombie-invading Philadelphia has been handled even-handedly, although Pitt's wife and daughters would only be the burden for his further mission. Bounding from South Korea to Jerusalem, then a considerably smaller-scaled finale inside a secular lab in Scotland, the film brings us a gripping journey but there is no superhero to save mankind. In the South Korea chapter, an unexpected self-shooting accident happens out of the left field, in view of the executor's seemingly essential role as the last straw to stop this mess. This is a wonderful surprise I don't mind watching more on screens nowadays. Moreover, the treatment of silence is another feat creatively applied here, pretty contrasts to the common hubbub in the action pack, but as a corollary, there will be an inconvenient silence-breaker thanks to the unwitting wife's timely call, otherwise, the act is too smooth and casualties can never be spared in this case (farewell, James Badge Dale). However, the pinnacle no doubt should attribute to the raiding of City of David, excellent airborne shots render viewers a stately sacredness to witness the havoc, a sarcastic indication of a rabble of Muslims hymning cheerfully would insanely precipitate zombies to rally outside the bulwarks and eventually break into the city thanks to their umpteen quantities, which is a tad offensive but from the prospect of a non-believer, the irony is a bonanza since we are in desperation for some gallows humor under the circumstances.Most dissenters would argue the reshoot of the final act (an original plan includes a massive combat sets in Moscow) is a letdown simply because it is not epic enough to culminate the prescribed 'the bigger the better' adrenaline drive, nevertheless, this thriftier approach options a no-gut-no-glory scheme which turns out to be a fairly conducted indoor thriller, and one can even laugh about the ostentatious plugging of the beverage company during the revelational discovery. The cast is inherently viable, Pitt underplays his charisma to be more approachable, it is rather comforting to see Enos clench a major film role and she could have been a better fighter than her screen hubby. In a nutshell, WORLD WAR Z is an entertaining popcorn fare, and doesn't try to patronize and outsmart its audience and showboats its CGI stunts to offer a bombarding sense of instantaneous grandiosity, which ultimately will fall bland in aftertaste. This alone can make most tentpoles pale in comparison!",8,0,1,20 September 2013
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games
","A cinema viewing of this soft Sci-Fi phenomenon, Jennifer Lawrence is the only impetus for me and the aftermath is unexpectedly satisfactory, with several inevitable grudges, among which is the shakily giddying cinematography, it may intend to be stylish, however one should not stay too much nearer the screen and it is not well-manipulated.The film is nerve-absorbing in its narrative particularly before the game time, the stunning sets and inhabitants tableaux of the rich capitol is better-than-expectedly glistening, but when the children-slaughtering begins, there is deficit in imagination and the SFX mainly falls flat.The film has already whisked away a TWILIGHT-sega triumph in the North American market, of which the worldwide popularity may fall short, but the sensational trend is irreversible, and as myself has completely sidelined TWILIGHT-sega, THE HUNGER GAMS is on a long run to be conquering an even wider demography (a more maturer one for sure). The performances are pleasantly orchestrated, an Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence does strike a memorable and convincing embodiment of our heroin, imbues her a role-model paradigm for the young generation around her age, she is invincible in nearly all her scenes, grabbing all the attention and only a polychromatic talk-show host spoofer Stanley Tucci could steal some meager thunder from her. Among others, Josh Hutcherson is controversially add some juice to the flavor, I haven't read the novels, so his character maybe have more space to show off his personal panache in the sequels if he is supposed to be the male leader. The killing is much diluted by the scratchy editing, but the ideal here in the novel and film may ring a bell of the violence-etched backbone of our society, especially for youngsters, the wackily colorful future (for the rich area of course) depicted in the film is too Utopian to be worshiped, and a female-dominated love-triangle has been slickly formed near the very end of the film, a wishful thinking is that the second one will not veneer too lachrymose like a TWILIGHT facsimile, as for the likeness with Japanese BATTLE ROYALE (2000), I haven't obtained any say-so by far without watching the latter. Anyway writer-turned-director Gary Ross (notably for SEABISCUIT 2003) is catching his fire to the next chapter, may it will break the sequel curse and we will be desperate in a hungrier condition after HARRY POTTER, TWILIGHT all come to an end.",7,0,4,4 April 2012
Zootopia," Two thumbs up!
","An atypical Disney studio animation comes out in March, ZOOTOPIA is a spunkily crowd-pleasing roller-coaster of gags, fun and wisdom, expediently taps into the anthropomorphic mammal fauna as a mirror of our own society, where the minority of predators is persecuted for their brutal nature which is designed by their DNAs, is it right to sacrifice the rights of a minority party just to ensure that a majority preys will feel safer? This is the lesson every kid (sometimes, the adults too) who is watching this picture should learn, so it is enormously pleasing to see Disney is judicious enough to be the torchbearer, to instill the notion of a harmonious society with co-existing diversity to children is an immeasurable deed can benefit future generations and promise a brighter future.Our protagonist is the rabbit Judy Hopps (Goodwin), who is determined to be the first bunny cop in the police force, against all odds, she makes it and starts to work in Zootopia. In spite of being belittled by her boss Chef Bogo (Elba), Judy befriends with a con artist, the fox Nick Wilde (Bateman), together they must solve a mysterious case of missing predators. Then, an ostensible triumph prompts Judy's politically uncorrected speech, which inadvertently incites the mass hostility towards the predators, so eventually, it is down to Judy and Nick to debunk a conspiracy theory carried out by the meekest species.The plot thickens halfway through, which indicates the story has more affinity to a Pixar-esque criterion than a common lower-age-aiming pap, and up to the segment where Judy apologises to Nick for her blunder, the film pulls off a fairly emotional catharsis, then rounds off with a bromide to reveal the (till that point) unsurprising culprit.The technical work is certainly above-par, Oscar-worthy to say the least. A ream of unorthodox characters, running the gamut from the limelight-stealing DMV officer sloth Flash to a rip-roaring Mr. Big pays homage to THE GODFATHER franchise, contradictions galore, but never overstay their welcome. So it is fairly safe to predict ZOOTOPIA will be a strong contender for next year's golden statute and Disney does elevate the bar for other studios to emulate, two thumbs up!",8,9,21,13 March 2016
The Impossible," The Impossible
","Naomi Watts just seized her second Oscar nomination (ended with an inevitable lose though) in this tsunami catastrophe survival drama which happened in South Asia 2004. Directed by Spanish young director Juan Antonio Bayona (yes, it is a Spanish production in spite of its mainly English-speaking cast), which marks his comeback after the internationally-accoladed debut THE ORPHANAGE (2007, 8/10), an ingeniously orchestrated horror-fest. The film's first half is a lip-smacking triumph not only for the special visual effects simulating the walls of water and its overwhelming impact, it's like HEREAFTER (2010, 6/10) meets 127 HOURS (2010, 8/10), vividly renders a kindness of faithful vicariousness on viewers through the white-knuckle self-salvage from the mother-son dyad. And if HEREAFTER could nab an Oscar nomination for BEST VISUAL EFFECTS, THE IMPOSSIBLE easily trumps it. But for the second half, the storytelling adopts a middle-of-the-road sentimentality, it is all about the reunion, still, there is a remarkable achievement for the editing team (and the cinematography group as well) to interlace Watts' flashbacks under the water with the operation she is undergoing, which is done with an eye-opening flourish. Adapted from a true event, from one hand, it affirmatively obviates the barbs like what's the odds the entire family (one couple with 3 son, age 12, 7 and 5 respectively) could pull through the calamity, it is a genuine miracle literally had happened (as far as the denouement concerned), so just deal with it! But from the other hand, the film shamefully sacrifices the accuracy for the sake of the emotional climax, which is a prerequisite for selling the tickets I suppose, and it worked (my eyes swelled with tears for many occasions), even simultaneously there is a tint of bathos ascending when the five of them finally find each other altogether at one place one time, it is so lame! Anyway, the film is also a victory for the cast, although Watts is bedridden for half of her time on screen, her hard-earned Oscar nomination is well-deserved, an impeccable endeavor out of the mundanity of her character (a woman try to survive under a dire circumstance). Tom Holland, the true leading man and great discovery from the film as the eldest son, has a stunning resemblance of a young Jamie Bell (what a coincidence, Tom was actually had a stint in BILLY ELLIOTS the musical to play the titular role in 2008, and call it sexism, academy never nominates teenage actors for their leading roles), most of the time he is the audience's proxy, we see through his eyes, his precocity and gallantry dominates the most chunk of the film's narrative and it has been executed unimpeachably. Ewan McGregor, absent for a disturbingly long time in the film, can only descend himself in a supporting part, he is a consistent great player in the race who is unfortunately always falling under the Oscar radar by only a notch, his cellphone-calling scene should be inscribed in every Oscar voter's mind, so next time, his glory will be duly justified. Also, the great Geraldine Chaplin, delivers the punchline 'the impossibility of death stars' in her unforgettable cameo.Juan Antonio Bayona has warranted his craftsmanship in dealing with spectacular sensations, so Hollywood might beckon him to their wonderland, even if not, I daresay the next big thing is on the rising. ps, I guess Seth MacFarlane did see this film since apart from MULHOLLAND DR. (2001, 9/10) we also saw your boobs here, Naomi, but this time we are in a rueful mood.",7,1,2,27 February 2013
Argo," Argo
","Ben Affleck's third foray into director ladder after GONE BABY GONE (2007, 8/10) and THE TOWN (2010, 7/10) has quite a rosy chance to clinch the first Oscar BEST DIRECTOR nomination for him, and a BEST PICTURE nomination is even more possible, thanks to the oscillating 5 to 10 quota. Albeit based on the true event, Affleck masters a thrilling suspense running through the entire film without any compromise to divert into a secondary priority catering for heroism which is Hollywood's usual gambit. The 1980s cold-war grainy indigo hue and Middle East settings are accurately revivified, from the intriguing opening sequences of the riot, the film has been sliding through a roller coaster adventures both in USA and in Iran, two paralleled story lines are in alliance with pitch-perfect tempo and tension, maybe for the admirers of the anti-terrorists series HOMELAND, the procedures are all too familiar and corny for political thrillers to spark off some evocative frisson, but the whole film holds up intact in its resilient poise to be entertaining and crowd-pleasing and it did it! Affleck as an actor may not be a laudable player, but this time he chooses a safer bet in playing the taciturn, diligent secret agent whose self-possession is the main requisite for the severe mission's quirky premise. Alan Arkin and John Goodman pair assume the light- hearted amusement inside the Hollywood industry, Mr. Arkin has his eloquent show-time may secure him another Oscar-nomination. Meanwhile, a touchy but tenacious Bryan Cranston also leaves an indelible trace of calibre in an otherwise flat role as the senior head. After three steadfast and advancing steps scaling up to a respectable position as an enterprising young director in Hollywood hierarchy, Mr. Affleck is confidently disposed to select more ambitious projects and hopes to achieve what Robert Redford had nabbed in the early 80s, an idol-breaking route to justify oneself he is much talented behind the camera other than possessing an ephemeral pretty face and sinewy physique.ps: My Oscar entries: BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and two slots in BEST S.

Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into Darkness
","I'm not a trekkie, and my first Star Trek film is the reboot STAR TREK (2009, 7/10), as a momentous pioneer to boost a whole new generation to embrace a revamped Sci-Fi franchise, it did a decent job thanks to J.J. Abrams' cachet in the category and the recurring hyped-up references from the soap sensation THE BIG BANG THEORY. 4 years later, the second installment finally arrives as a leviathan summer blockbuster as its predecessor, the Enterprise's new intergalactic adventure takes off with the entire crew members back under the J.J. Abrams' helm, this time holding the villain name tag is the red-hot Benedict Cumberbatch, sports a dashing windbreaker, frowns while practices his merciless slaughter, hardly a novel creation, but he does invigorate the tension by delivering his spiteful lines with Bardic cadence.Once again, the same bad-guy-(willingly)-being-caught-in-the-middle-of-the-film trope bears the importance as a game-changing twist, then after a spate of nifty but anticipated internal hazards and warp chase, the final battle returns to earth for a bland point-blank hand-to-hand combat. Most obtrusively, Kirk and Spock's bromance has been handily elevated into another Platonic level, the near-death confession scenes overtly suggests it will exist as an unerring theme in the whole running, it is embarrassing to see the almost zero chemistry between Spock and Uhura, even for a dispassionate Vulcan, the innuendo is quite palpable, only Kirk can melt Spock's cold- hearted veneer and illicit his human part of being dramatic, impulsive and vengeful. Sidekicks are the same old story, Simon Pegg is entrusted to assume as the saviors at least twice, apart from his usual levity to induce laughters. Newcomer Alice Eve offers a gratuitous bikini scene in the wink of an eye, which awkwardly belies the rashness to cater to the film's core ticket-or- DVD-buyers (geeky nerds mostly), which is a clumsy and paltry strategy.The visual effect has its glorious achievement in some section, but there is a dearth of awe- inspiring imagination to outdo the ruck of Hollywood tentpoles. Much appreciation should be impute to the polished editing and narrative pace, the film seldom slackens to a dull moment for viewers to think twice about its logical practicality of the deeds involved. If it is not entirely appealing to audiences from all strata, at the minimum, trekkies will not cold-shoulder it and most likely, it is a qualified sequel to spur the vitality for another Star Trek binge in the near future. But an apprehensive concern is that since J.J. Abrams has embarked on to reinstate the more preeminent STAR WARS brand, I sincerely hope a new director will bring a paradigm shift for its third venture, it should not perpetually be overshadowed as a spin-off or a cheaper version of the former (at least the characters are more interesting and dynamic), what's more, it is anything but cheap gauging by its production budget, it has everything to challenge the elephant in the room now!",7,1,2,2 September 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid, Love.
","After their ill-fated director debut, I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2009), duo filmmakers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa comes back with this sleeper hit in the lukewarm summer last year, it is a G-rated rom-com, composed of run-of-the-mill scenarios, but exquisitely draws me head over heels for it. It took 6 years for Steve Carell to upgrade his 40-year-old-virgin status to a 44-year-old- loyal-husband honor, whose sexual object has remained as singular form with his soulmate (then high-school sweetheart, now the wife for 22 years, who is submerging into a quotidian middle age crisis). Steve exudes a tremendous bent of poker-face acting in this film, flavored with a whiff of sarcastic and knowing jokes; it is also a delight to embrace Julianne Moore back to a mainstream rom com since LAWS OF ATTRACTION (2004), her role is well-measured and no one will ever doubt her capacity to be competent for it. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone pair suffers from a shorter screen time for their corresponding story about an invincible womanizer meets the girl of his life; but Gosling has the qualification to stride swaggeringly in the Hollywood now because his filmography proves that he is the next George Clooney with a much earlier inception (judging fairly by his three films coming in 2010). There are a third love lateral in the film, a 13-year-old boy's puppy love, could have been a filler, but owing to youngster Jonah Bobo's precocious strain, it parallels immaculately with the main artery. Another two big names here Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon, the former's short appearance is the most hysterical part of the film and the latter is unworthily unprepossessing. Near ‚Öî of the film, there is a sterlingly concocted plot twist which could be a gratifying surprise, which attests not only Dan Fogelman's well-structured script but Ficarra-Requa's ingenuity as well, I have seen a budding spark from this worn-out genre of Hollywood film industry.",8,1,2,11 January 2012
The Babadook," A bedtime story turns into a dreadful incubus
","'THE BADADOOK is a small-scale, low-budget horror feat, economically ekes out the hair-raising imagery of its titular creature (you never catch its entirety but it haunts from the ground up), but smartly uses it as a surrogate of one's inescapable grief.

The Danish Girl," a winsome movie, but not a brave one
","Tom Hopper's follow-up of THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) and LES MISERABLES (2012) is a 'true' story about Einar Wegner, aka. Lili Elbe (Redmayne), a Danish landscape painter in 1920s, who was among the first recipients of sex change surgery in the human history, and the film is all about the telling love story between him and his supporting wife Gerda (Vikander), a portrait artist, and how they mange to shoulder on during Einar/Lili's unconventional pursuit to become a real woman.If you do some background checking, you will find the film is not nearly based on the real story of Einar and Gerda, indeed, most of the depiction is fictionalized in its source novel written by David Ebershoff. So it is rather shameful the movie has been painstakingly marketed with the 'based on a true story' tag just because it looks more like an Oscar bait.Also, tackling the thorny issue of trans-gender cognition, the film is told entirely through the point- of-view from a male perspective to define a woman (fancy dresses, makeups, a vagina, that is all ) and a tolerant and support wife, an imaginary elaboration from a cisgender mindset, which can be explored as a particular angle, but when the whole narrative pivots around it, the film will definitely not appear as politically correct.Against all these hindrances, THE DANISH GIRL is a breathtakingly gorgeous achievement on all its technical levels, Desplat's magnificent score ushers audience into the splendor of its production design, costume, landscape, architecture and art pieces, on the eye level, the film is impeccably enticing. Then the performances of two leads, the 'it' star in Hollywood now, Vikander won as Oscar for her 'supporting' role, if one takes the word literally, she is indeed the most supporting character you can expect, except one brief moment of lapse when she seeks comfort from the hunky art dealer Hans Axgil (Schoenaerts). Her win really becomes a nuisance if we think of the exact same position of Felicity Jones in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING (2014), her Jane Hawking is a 'leading' role in her own life, instead of being a 'supporting' wife for Stephen Hawking (Redmayne again), otherwise she could have given Patricia Arquette a good run for her money.Although Redmayne's physiognomy is too angular to call it as an earthly beauty and there are certain cringe-worthy moments when he relentlessly tries to imitate the feminine mannerism in front of the mirror, it is self-consciously awkward and betrays Redmayne's self-effacing nature, but this is what the best one can get from allowing a male actor to play a trans-gender pioneer, something is congenitally missing at the first placeAnyway, THE DANISH GIRL effectuates its emotional punch when reaching its lugubrious finish line, albeit its inadequately adapted screenplay. Frankly speaking it is a winsome movie, but it is not a brave one, a lost opportunity to bring about something extraordinary (casting a real trans- actor in the leading role for instance) out of an inspiring and valuable true story.",7,0,1,1 April 2016
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
","Saw this one from a IMAX screen in the multiplex cinema in Perugia, I was impressed not only by the grand scale of the cinema, also the impossibility to reach there unless I have a car. No buses or the SUPER-MINIMETRO are nearby (I walked for 20 minutes to reach the nearest minimetro station). What a pity, otherwise I would definitely visit it more often. About this film, as I am definitely no video-game fan, I'm indifferent to the fact of where this film is adapted from. My interest is to see how Disney produces a summer-pop-corn- Hollywood-blockbuster. The outcome is that this film is just so-so, with the special effects (SFs) creating no surprises, even a little bit shabby, I have to say THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ME MUCH.Let's talk about actors, Jake is on his way to become a superstar, which is no doubt, so POP is his touchstone, but no personal charisma could be empathized from Prince Dastan if compared to Depp as Captain Jack (Ok, the muscular hot body is the only exception). Thus Jake still needs a little more patience and the deposits of time to show his unique charm. As For Gemma, I have nothing to say, the role is weak and unimpressive (although I think she is not so attractive with the bizarre costumes), Kingsley and Molina both do a good supporting roles in a blockbuster summer bomb. Btw, I watched the whole film in Italian and without any subtitles, which caused a little bit trouble to understand what actually happened (but does it matter?), nevertheless the film is enjoyable with too many clich√©s, I could literally tell what will happen even without knowing the storyline (i.e. the death of the king, or the death of that poor black fighter, a look- familiar Steve Toussaint), one thing I don't quite comprehend is the technical usage of the dagger and the sands, which bothered me while watching the film (maybe BOTHER is a word too serious here). With age-growing, I find myself more and more immune to the high-budget and eye- bombing Hollywood blockbusters, perhaps I am also excluded from their main targets (wow, what a relief). So come on! Here comes the next generation who can genuinely enjoy themselves from these films and I am officially retired!http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",5,1,2,14 August 2010
Knives Out," KNIVES OUT is sumptuous to the eye but also salutary to the brain, a whole package for optimal consumption
","'Afflicted by the silly proclivity of involuntary vomiting whenever she tells a lie, Marta's version of the incidence is laid bare really early on the way, which firmly shoves audience's empathy and perspective on her side as experienced spectators know all too well, that version of the story is just a guise full of cracks and holes need to be exposed, Marta turns out to be the sole inheritor of Harlan's massive fortune, which instantaneously prompts the Thrombey family to turn on her with venomous aspersion and threats. Johnson's script craftily jumps on the bandwagon of the racial sensibility by pitting Marta against the whole bunch of white rich bigots, among which, Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda, Harlan's firstborn, vehemently goes berserk with both barrels in her hypocritical outburst, but we should also feel sorry for her, as a business mogul, she is saddled with a cheating husband (Johnson) and a deadbeat son Ransom (Evans); Michael Shannon's Walter Thrombey, Harlan's youngest son, goes with a different approach, tentatively dragooning Marta with veiled menace. But, as empty vase makes the most noice, up till then, most audience would be confident that they're all red herrings (Toni Collette is toothsome in her shameless freeloader mannerism as Joni, the widow of Harlan's deceased son).'read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",7,3,6,2 December 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," an outstanding piece of cinema, by all means
","Catching up on Oscar-caliber films which I have yet to watch, I stumble upon this Argentinian crime-drama, a fair upsetter won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM over more critically acclaimed THE WHITE RIBBON (2009, 8/10) and A PROPHET (2009, 9/10), in its own strength, THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES is a powerful and near-perfect dissection on how people are stuck in the prison of their own memories, 'you will end up with only memories' is a vital sentence imprinted deeply in audience's mind. In 1999, a retired legal counselor Benjam√≠n Esposito (Dar√≠n) visits his former chief Irene (Villamil), with whom he is secretly in love for over 20 years, Benjam√≠n tells her that he decides to write a novel about the horrendous rape-and-murder case of Liliana Coloto (Quevedo) in 1974, which would subsequently prompt him to leave both his job and Irene, in parallel, the film recounts how Benjam√≠n and his drunkard parter Pablo Sandoval (Francella) traced down the suspect Isidoro G√≥mez (Godino), but thanks to the iniquitous loophole in the law system, the murderer got away with life sentence and became a threat to Benjam√≠n's personal safety; alternately, it narratives the latest updates of the rekindled romance between Benjam√≠n and Irene, until a final unforeseen discovery of Isidoro's whereabout, it is never easy to acquire a closure in regard to one's troubled past.Majestically directed by Argentinian director Juan Jos√© Campanella, who studied film in New York University and is a regular hand in TV series (HOUSE M.D., LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT, and HALT AND CATCH FIRE), this film is his 5th feature, Campanella fabricates a slow-paced, reality-and-imagination entwined narrative under a retro palette, patiently builds up personae with rigid framing-compositions and intricate editing, often collates the two time-lines with subtle indications which intrigue multiple viewings. He and the DP F√©lix Monti have accomplished a brilliant long take (with superbly imperceptible editing sleight of hand) which starts from a hovering airborne shot of the stadium and authentically records the entire activity, from Benjam√≠n and Pablo spot Isidoro among a full-packed stadium during an ongoing football match, to the subsequent cat-and-mouse chase until the suspect is captured, it exemplifies the fly-on-the-wall intensity and altogether it runs more than 5 minutes, which can blow any cinephile's mind.Indeed, apart from its formalistic artery as a hefty CSI-styled chronicler, another amazingly satisfying deed is the suspense, not all over the place but when it approaches to the crunches, the edge-of-the-seat feeling accumulates and the suspense becomes grippingly pervasive, namely, the two most appalling findings in the film (one abrupt death and another is the revealing of the truth), both grimly under-lit and the effect is soul-crunching. The picture is also abounding with top-notch performances, Dar√≠n and Villamil, bring about strong affinity in-between the 25-years time span, both render their feelings with indelible restraint, the shut-the-door metaphor keeps their unspoken connotations up and running. Guillermo Francella is the scene-stealing sidekick with an offbeat personality, not only he addresses cogently the pinpointed theory about man's invariable passion, his heroic act comes as resounding and pathos-inducing as well, what's more enticing, we don't know whether it is the real happening or the creation of Benjam√≠n's wishful thinking. Pablo Rago, who plays Liliana's grieved husband Ricardo, carries the responsibility of being the linchpin in the plot as another prisoner of a traumatized past, and he also pulls off what Benjam√≠n claims 'the purest love he has ever seen', all four are in my top-10 line-up of 2009, although I push Villamil in the supporting group since almost all her scenes are with Dar√≠n, her side of story never laid bare and she is mostly absent in Dar√≠n's investigation procedure. From 'temo' to 'te amo', it is a creatively designed wordplay for Benjam√≠n's life-consuming odyssey to find his missing 'a', Juan Jos√© Campanella commands a humanized brush to retouch a cautionary tale embedded with harrowing profundity and self-reflected sobriety, an outstanding piece of cinema, by all means.",9,3,4,8 July 2014
127 Hours," 127 Hours
","From the first frame, the breathtaking beauty of the cinematography subjugated me since Danny Boyle's consistent visual concussion maintained at a high standard. I am not a rhapsodic traveler at all, still I was moved by the film and by the protagonist Aron Ralston.The film deals with a quite essential proposition that when we encounter our incubus expectedly (for Aron, it was the stone, and for numerous others, it could be anything which may serve us as a hindrance), how to gather the courage, then exert reduction to practice to vanquish it eventually; the whole process is a personal sublimation for each individual as well. The one-actor setting offers James Franco a chance once in a blue moon that he could take it as his career's magnum opus. Thankfully he lives up to our expectation and delivers a energetic and vivid performance which should be concluded as powerful and splendid! I put him as my No.2 BEST ACTOR 2010 (after Jesse Eisenberg) by far. Now 2011 Oscar has just finished, Franco's sluggish state does suggest that it is a wise decision that he should never meddle with emcee anymore. I think the bloody nerve-cutting scene does persuade some potential audience from watching it, which I consider is a big loss, if one could endure the raw physiological torture (literally it only lasts several seconds at most), you will find it is worthwhile. The flashbacks & illusions after the accident happened were well-crafted, diluted the humdrum of the crack setting and enriched the character too. It is an amazing payoff as the storyline is way too thin (compared with SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) to be scripted into a feature length film. After the overwhelming success of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008), Boyle's follow-up inherits his skillful interpretation and devotes an encouraging film which once again shows his surefooted talent to make wonders.",8,2,3,2 March 2011

Creed," CREED adheres to the boxing genre's time-honored formula step by step, solid but novelty is wanting
","Populist action movie-stars have no fluke with Oscar glory, that is a truism (sorry Schwarzenegger, Willis, Statham, Diesel,'The Rock' Johnson and others of that ilk) saving Jackie Chan's Honorary Award for his unabated career spanning over half-a-century and still counting, the closest call to win a competitive Oscar is Sylvester Stallone, whose underdog boxing tale ROCKY (1976) fortunately arrives in the inchoate stage of his m√©tier, before he would establish himself as an action practitioner, and a rather iconic one. Stallone received 2 Oscar nominations for ROCKY, one for acting and another for writing the screenplay, and came home empty-handed, but don't be sorry for him, ROCKY scooped the biggest award that night. So when CREED hailed Stallone's triumphant return last year as Rocky Balboa (his sixth film in that role) into the Oscar fray, it seemed finally Stallone would get that belated recognition, although at the age of 69, he plays the second fiddle for the first time in the franchise which has been consistently become his gravy train for nearly four decades. The bone was thrown, but the laurels didn't come ultimately, nostalgia fails to transform into votes, since after all, it is a too well- concocted performance aiming to canonize Rocky's legacy at the expense of a rounded exploration of a beloved character. In CREED, Rocky Balboa has retired from boxing and opened an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia, survives his wife Adrian and his loyal partner Paulie. When Adonis Johnson (Jordan), the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, the former heavyweight champion featured heavily in the previous ROCKY series, comes at his doorstep to plead him to become his trainer, Rocky declines at first, but changes his mind afterwards and a garden-variety father-and-son bond starts to shape up, intermittently saddled with life-threatening cancer, personal clich√©s - Adonis is bound to have a falling out with his new girlfriend Bianca (Thompson, a Rihanna dead ringer and entrains a scrumptious vibe with Jordan in a default role), a singer-songwriter who is going to be deaf, all to anticipate Adonis' hard-earned honor in his 12-bouts with a troubled British champion Ricky Conlan (Bellew). That's it, CREED adheres to the boxing genre's time-honored formula step by step, without ever trying to go out of the left field, and plays up the schmaltz card on Rocky's avuncular benevolence, which doesn't entirely looks suspicious thanks to Stallone and Jordan's unaffected interactions. We know Adonis needs Rocky more than Rocky needs him in the first place, Rocky has a tranquil life, a stable income, well-respected in his community, loneliness may encroach him through time, but frankly speaking, he doesn't need Adonis to rekindle his life, because getting old isn't equivalent to misery, his decision to quietly accept his health condition is also well justified with dignity and sensibility, Rocky is fine without Adonis, but not otherwise. However, in order to make up a cutesy mutually dependent rapport between them, the script goes out on a limb to build it on its spindly material, it makes Adonis the one who convinces Rocky to accept chemotherapy (yeah, he doesn't want Rocky die so soon for an obvious reason!), suddenly, Adonis becomes a surrogate son to the bereft Rocky, how? All we see is their routine training, all on chummy terms, but that doesn't make them family. The intention is good, but talk the talk, walk the walk. For all that, CREED, director Ryan Coogler's follow-up after his breakthrough indie FRUITVILLE STATION (2013), which also stars Jordan, is not at all an awful experience, it boosts Coogler's competence behind the camera and especially during the money shots - the boxing set pieces, where camera sticks closely to the players and swerves fluidly inside the boxing ring with outstanding choreography, no wonder Coogler has been enlisted to make Marvel's BLACK PANTHER (2018), and brings Jordan on board too, as the arch-enemy of T'Challa, Erik Killmonger, take that Chadwick Boseman! Jordan takes it on himself to prepare the role of Adonis with full physique overhaul and stands out as a natural thespian who can produce organic screen magnetism, presently, if we could all pretend that the remake of FANTASTIC FOUR (2015) has never happened, he seems to be the most promising successor of Denzel Washington (yes, not Will Smith), but who knows, the reviewer once had high hopes for Derek Luke and Taye Diggs, where are they now?",7,0,1,7 December 2016
About Time," a crowd-pleaser but the time travel setting backfires
","ABOUT TIME is one half snappy romance and another half family drama which lures us into the tutelage of some very beneficial 'Chicken Soup for the Soul' truisms like 'value your life and live everyday fully', 'notice the beauty in the small things around you' and 'be brave to say goodbye to the beloved and move on', such and such. And under the sine qua non of a time-travel set-up. At the age of 21, Tim (Gleeson in his breakthrough leading man offer), a clumsy young Brit learns from his father (Nighy) that all men in his family can travel in time (with certain limitation for sure). So with this windfall fate-altering gift, Tim starts to woo Mary, the girl of his dream, and eventually they get married and babies are coming on the way. On the face value, the film is tremendously entertaining and heart-warming, Tim's naturalistic maladroitness proffers enough ballast for repeating his one-trick pony to finally win Mary over, along the way there are laughters galore; the family bond is also capaciously constructed between Tim and his father, and a detour to save his sister Kit Kat (Wilson) from wrong choices in her life. The biggest revelation of the time-travel theory comes after Tim has fixed Kit Kat's past by going back to the time-line before the conception of Tim and Mary's first baby, when he jumps back, the process has altered the baby's gender. Then immediately after that scene Tim manages to miraculously change everything back to normal, so clearly this 'no pre- baby travel' rule can be amended afterward. Which drastically conflicts with the eventual dilemma of choosing between going back to visit his deceased father and having a baby no. 3 after his dad's death, for the reason that he can reverse the repercussion of the butterfly effects whatsoever (as he did in the case of Kit Kat). I'm not nitpicking (as I am more than happier to overlook the technicality of time-travel experience, take one example, how come Kit Kat gets a hunch that she is in love with Jay after they went back to the past and altered their fate, while Tim is oblivious of his newborn baby's gender until he sees him with his own eyes?), but the film is deeply flawed in a logic stand-point and this plot-hole is too glaring to overlook, which does hurt the movie's empathy in its final stage. Alas, the performances are generally favorable, Nighy surges into my Supporting Actor chart as a benevolent father figure, immensely understanding and reasonable, passes on his wisdom (which accumulated through ages) with coherent delivery, and as the sole theory elucidator, he is the one attracts the most amount of interest on screen (although he should have warned his son about the rule beforehand, which would save the film from its paradoxical miasma).Gleeson and McAdams makes a fitting couple, although for the latter, it is her third time being the girl of a time-traveler (after Eric Bana and Owen Wilson), her American sweetheart default and clever dressing choice remarkably masks the age difference, while a baby-face Gleeson doesn't truly reflect the passing years in the narrative. There are also several interesting secondary players, the sexy bomb Margot Robbie appears as Tim's unrequited love interest, Lindsay Duncan sheds a light of coolness as Tim's unwitting mother, and Tom Hollander is the swearing playwright with a cynical bad temper. ABOUT TIME is Oscar- nominated writer Richard Curtis' third venture (the man who writes MR. BEAN series, BRIDGET JONES series, NOTTING HILL 1999, and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 1994, 7/10) as a director (after LOVE ACTUALLY 2003, 7/10 and PIRATE RADIO 2009), no wonder it is such a successful crowd-pleaser and even a tearjerker, only if its content could have made more sense out of the infinite loop impedes the time travel sub-genre.",6,18,33,30 October 2014
The Hustler," A Quartet of classic performances
","For a non-billiards-player, one might cavil this monochromatic classic seems to be a shade monotonous for the first half an hour of the running time, although one will surely be stunned by Newman and Gleason's pool table panache, but thanks to its confined layout and dooming denouement, a game predestined to lose for Newman with a prolonged battle against sleepiness and spiked by alcohol intake, all too familiar and stale to prompt a taut vibe. However, things are getting better, when Sarah (Laurie) being introduced to this male-crammed coterie, she lights up the screen instantly, a damaged cripple longing for a secure relationship, her chimera would eventually be shattered into pieces to cement her lover Eddie's (Newman) 'character' which is prerequisite for him to be the top pick among the bunch. Laurie's intuitively destructive performance enables the film to be more affecting than the usual offerings where female-roles are decorative and neglectful. Newman also stretches out in his best form to deliver the gamut of emotions through the narrative arc, deadly charming as he is, Eddie is a far cry being a complete likable fellow as he appears to be, even finally he beats Minnesota Fats (Gleason) and valiantly defies and censures Bert's (Scott) greed and vileness, he still bears a certain degree of responsibility to the tragedy occurred before, in the end, he is more a repentant sinner than a victorious hero. Each of the four actors (Newman, Laurie, Gleason and Scott) grabbed an Oscar nomination for his or her work, both competing in the supporting actor category, retrospectively speaking, Scott's flagrant menace isn't a too taxing requirement out of his comfortable zone, while Gleason's reserved taciturnity implies much more chewy undertones than he purports to be, which positively suggests his background story would spin another gripping and morally-ambiguous tale easily. Personally I give the edge to Gleason. Other than a sterling cluster of awards-worthy performances, THE HUSTLER is elegantly conducted by Robert Rossen, a gone-too-soon figure in Hollywood manufacture (passed away at the age of 57 in 1966), conscientiously teases out the best of his cast under a low-key production paddings and represents us a visceral parable on human nature's weakness. P.S. The next step for me to dig into Newman's oeuvre is the unofficial sequel THE COLOR OF MONEY (1986), a Scorsese's production belatedly gave Newman a golden statue which he should have won decades ago.",8,1,1,6 September 2013
Spotlight," SPOTLIGHT should win BEST PICTURE this year, not that Oscar really matters these days, it is just a do-the-right-thing testimony for the sake of its own reputation
","It is self-evident that SPOTLIGHT is a tailor-made Oscar-bait in every aspect, chronicles the sensational and gasping 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning reportage by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team, to disclose the rampant pedophiliac activity among the Roman Catholic church in Boston, a more shocking revelation is the fact that the entire church system has been unscrupulously cover these clergymen over decades, transfers them from parish to parish, and nips any opposition in the buds. The film is a strenuously faithful re-enactment of the story, directed and co-written by Tom McCarthy as the fifth time he sits in the director chair after a quite consistently outstanding resum√© (THE STATION AGENT 2003, THE VISTOR 2007, WIN WIN 2011), on the ground that we could all pretend that the horrendous Adam Sandler vehicle THE COBBLER (2014) had never happened.It is remarkable that McCarthy adopts a completely down-to-earth approach to present the narrative, encourages his sterling ensemble cast to strike a personal contact with their real-life characters and maximumly imitates their personalities to the silver screen, no melodramatic frills are allowed to manipulate audience's reactions and simply lets the truth speaks for itself, and trust me, it is more than enough to make the point.The whole investigation is conducted at the behest of the newly-appointed editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), whose Jewish origin could be appropriated as an easy target for his motivation, but his keen perception and pensive temperament determine that there is nothing to hold him back until they hold the whole corrupt system accountable for the sin. Schreiber's resilient, withdrawn acting option works like magic.The Spotlight team quartet is headed by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Keaton), with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) and Matt Carroll (James), the investigative process is formulaic and daunting, indefatigably following the leads until one gets what he wants, or better, a new discovery. Meanwhile, McCarthy is extremely parsimonious to shed any light on his characters' personal lives, as if he is making a point that journalists barely have anything else apart from their work, in hindsight, it is probably the safest way to avoid any lawsuit due to poetic licence, since most of the characters are still alive-and-kicking, no level-headed individual wants his or her own private hurdles being exposed for exploitation. On the other hand, McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer is level-headed enough to not over-hype their activities either (since it is obvious that vested interest is always a collateral byproduct in the journalism against their altruistic motivation), thus, no individual heroism pops out stridently, and what we see, is a conscientious teamwork steadily dredges up scandalous evidences, and a understated minor twist reveals a lamentable remiss which could have changed the status quo decades earlier.Ruffalo, bags his third Oscar-nomination amongst all the male cast, while McAdams is the lucky gal honoured with a coattail nomination being the only woman in the ensemble. That is not to say that their performances are inferior, on the contrary, everyone is well-deserved for their ensemble win in the SAG, since their interpretation is closely complying with their respective character, and it happens to be, those journalists don't possess the larger-than-life persona, the only time, a remotely over-the-top moment belongs to Ruffalo's Michael, that's why he is the pick by the academy, but Keaton, Schreiber, Tucci, even Crudup portray their roles in a more accomplished flair, plus, in my book, Ruffalo should be shifted to a borderline leading role (he has the most screen time and his contribution to the project is most minutely detailed), to save some space for his co-stars.Unarguably, SPOTLIGHT is an important film expos√© depicting a rotten underbelly of our society and what we should heed is its aftermath, since the Boston discovery is merely a tip of the iceberg, if one can lucidly imagine the whole ugly picture, it is not difficult to picture the colossal disillusion it inflicts on religious devotees who has a conscience, whom we deem as the pillar of a healthy society and perhaps, something positive could happen from within, for that reason alone, SPOTLIGHT should win BEST PICTURE this year, not that Oscar really matters these days, it is just a do-the-right-thing testimony for the sake of its own reputation.",8,2,4,21 February 2016

Before watching the film, I cannot stop thinking that what makes this highly-praised indie film of 2009 so unique as its synopsis sounds really banal. Nevertheless after I finish the film, I do love it from the bottom of my heart and it turns out quite educational for most lovers as well. In order to make this ultra-predictable story more delicious and attractive, director Marc Webb has offered us multiple levels of distractions, including the whole random narrative order, the reality/expectation split-screen shots and even animations, which shows that the team behind do esteem their audiences. I think it is also an important reason why Marc has been selected as the director of the upcoming Spider Man IV, as he knows very well how to please the audience and respect them at the same time.Also the success of this film is largely owing to two protagonists' wonderful performances, especially for Joseph, I would give him an Oscar nomination if I was could, unfortunately the Academy members generally overlook this kind of light films. The chemistry between Joseph and Zooey are amazing and sincere, as if they just revert themselves to their authentic lives, sometimes the effect is heartrending, which was like a mirror, everyone could see himself/herself through the film.One of my recurring argument is that it is very difficult to find a great script nowadays, which doesn't mean one could not be able to shoot a great film, '(500) Days of Summer' is a perfect example, even with a totally mundane story with a suspense-free script, if only one is conscientious and determined, he still can make a film unique and enjoyable, I think the esteem towards the massive audience is the main factor, which barely can be found in most of recent films.",8,1,2,17 August 2010
Thor: Ragnarok," THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters
","Entrusted in the hands of Kiwi wiz Taika Waititi, the third installment of Marvel's Norse god substantially alters its predecessors' Shakespearean solemnity while rings small changes in the cookie-cutter plot. Right out of the box, Thor (Hemsworth) appears to be modulated in an unusually verbose mood when confronting the fire demon Surur, a scourge of Asgard, who threats to bring Ragnarok (a prophesy of doom of most Norse heroes) to the empyrean planet, only becomes a mere bagatelle under Thor's mighty, that is the tonal-setting prologue, levity and spectacle are the two sides of a helluva galactic ride. The real danger is within the family, an exiled and soon-to-perish Odin (Hopkins) apprises his two sons that his first-born, the ambitious Hela (Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who has been sealed in the prison by him, will be back to reclaim her birthright and play havoc with whoever stands in her way (including the loyal Warriors Three, all dispatched offhandedly en passant). Defeated by Hela, Thor and Loki (Hiddleston) are stranded in the planet Sakaar, literally a huge garbage dumping ground (a smart sideswipe of earth's unsustainable consumerism, mark my words, this is something humans definitely will do when galactic travel will become handy), and its potentate, Grandmaster (a gleefully snide Goldblum) has an archaic hobbyhorse, gladiator fighting, which sets Thor against his 'friend from work' the Hulk/Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), also explains their conspicuous absence in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016). Soon the trio escapes with a bibulous huntress Valkyrie (Thompson), together they must defend the unvanquished Hela and her resurrected army, so if Ragnarok is preordained, might as well leaving Hela with the calamity, as long as they can take a throng of token survivors and play up the humanistic stopgap, however feeble is might look because you just cannot equate an entire planet with (at most) several hundreds lives. The final victory is hardly a mood-booster, that is why this fiber of discrepancy (playfulness and grave loss) takes its toll in the end. A trendy haircut does do justice to Hemsworth's buff appeal and apparently his comedy timing (apart from showing off his immaculate bod) and it looks like that Loki and Heimdall (Elba) are next in line for a coiffure upgrade; we cannot get enough of Cate Blanchett snarling and blustering in a sleek suit with lissome martial arts postures, her Hela is unapologetic-ally lethal, but some subtlety would have been nice considering her immense craft. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie is the latest addition of Marvel's (not too prescient) recruitment of female superheroes and she is ass-kicking and can equally stand her ground and hold her liquor. Waititi's revamp is a welcome step-up for the ever-expanding comic cinematic universe in toto, its varicolored brio, astute sonic placement, astonishing visual swagger and bristling action verve are exactly what gratify and appeal to its core audience, there is something idiosyncratic lurking beneath a mainstream blockbuster, a baby-step maybe, at least THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters, isn't it?",7,3,6,5 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris
","I'm not a firm buff of Woody Allen's films and also unable to catch up with his prolific filmography, I skipped his last two features YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER (2010) and WHATEVER WORKS (2009) after a delightfully absorbing VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA (2008) MIDNIGHT IN Paris has been hyped to be a new pinnacle of Allen's late career (a career peak in the North American box-office too) since its release, maybe even nourish a slight chance for a BEST PICTURE Oscar nomination, which has been long overdue for any Woody's pictures since HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), but after my viewing, I find it not so rosy on its Oscar path, I presume the sole possible chance is still Allen's strong suit, the screenplay and that will be all!I like the film by and large and I find the back-from-the-future plot is intriguing at first, then after the unorthodox Cinderella-esque midnight wander becomes the the inscrutable linchpin, the arrest deflates bit by bit while an intense concussion of bathos becomes presiding. Clearly the film is a love-letter (maybe a love-postcard) to Paris from Allen (strangely there is no French funds for the film, which is indeed a Spain-USA concoction), maybe I have no such approbation for Paris (a city doesn't tempt me for a must-see visit), so I feel neutrally immune to the cameos from those prominent artists of1920s (the only memorable presence is none other than Corey Stoll's chivalric Hemingway, who manages to exude a few wisdom from his sidelined character, his remark about a true hero's not-afraid-of-death-status is biased but contains Woody Allen's own sullen wit). Basically speaking, there is no single performance is outstanding like Woody's previous works (notable for its notorious hotbed for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS nominations), but female characters' overpowering poise is always there, my personal penchant leans to Rachel McAdams' stereotypical mean woman caricature, repelling enough so as to that I adore her more, not the character but the acting per se. Marion Cotillard is being squandered drastically, but it will not hurt her charisma; other numerous secondary characters are all nothing but linear. The film proposes a contentious subject matter, a nostalgia addiction of the Golden Age, but in my opinion, why don't we just treasure art itself without encountering the artists (or asking yourself before make the move, 'am I sure I can handle a true artist?), but if you are aiming for a sizable discount, it would be a different cup of tea then.",6,1,2,26 December 2011
Youth," Is Sorrentino a one-trick pony?
","YOUTH is Sorrentino's much-anticipated follow-up of the Academy winner THE GREAT BEAUTY (2013), an English-speaking ensemble piece set in a posh resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a retired music maestro, he is on vacation with his best-friend-cum-in-law, Mick Boyle (Keitel), an esteemed woman's director brainstorms with his group of screenwriters for his final testimony, an ambitious work tailor-made for the prestigious actress Brenda Morel (Fonda), who is discovered by Mick over half-a-century ago.Fred and Mick are friends since childhood, but now both reaching 80, their world-view cannot be more different, Fred is relentlessly apathetic towards his work, he refuses multiple times to the request of Queen Elizabeth to perform his most famous piece 'Simple Songs' for Prince Philips' anniversary, and rebuffs a proposal to write his memoir and asks to be forgotten by the world. While Mick, still enthusiastically integrates with his writer-quintet to finalize the script of his swan-song, a supposed masterpiece for the audience. Yet the two pair harmoniously with their daily pee competition and jostle for memories of their past.There are other characters, Lena (Weisz), Fred's daughter, experiences a one-sided breakup from Julian (Stoppard), Mick's son, who leaves her for Paloma Faith, the real-life British pop star (whose CGI music video is just too surreal even in for a Sorrentino's production). Paul Dano plays Jimmy Tree, a young actor eternally acknowledged by his most popular role, a robot, and prepares for a new role as Adolf Hitler, which will examine the real driving force that propels him to strive in the business. Also, the overweight Maradona (Serrano), a new Miss Universe (Ghenea), a young masseuse (Mijovic) and a mountaineering coach (Seethaler), all leaves their inkings in the narrative.But is Sorrentino's ostensibly life-contemplating poshness makes him an auteur of our times? The answer is moot at present, one might be too cynical to call him a poseur, but I suppose an outstanding tableaux artisan is more appropriate right now, no one can deny the imposing beauty of his artsy compositions of his shots and the exalted gratification of his ear-friendly music preferences, yet, as a screenwriter, his dialogue is either clich√©-laden or overtly vying to be a dictum, all the best parts are those without words, apparently English language and narrative is really not his strongest suit.Headlining a glamorous cast, Caine restrains a poised existence against the world around him, his frosty side only breaks down near the end, after the suicide accident (which pales in comparison with IDA 2013 in the same abrupt fashion), and his eventual compromise betrays a tough man/husband/father's unwilling resignation of his conviction. Keitel has always been a character actor wanting a certain gradation of versatility, his two-hander with Fonda tellingly proves that, he is barely able to retort back in the assumed tit-for-tat show-piece which serves as their Oscar-bait, however his last line is greatly moving 'emotion is everything', eventually he is a martyr for his belief, after the fatal betrayal and he lets his emotions to reign over his life for the last time.It is easy to understand why Jane Fonda is hyped for an Oscar nomination here, she plays a two-times Oscar-winning diva, basically a larger-than-life version of herself (or is it?) with ridiculously heavy make-up, it is the most showy performance among the cast, but frankly, it is a five-minutes cameo, can she pull off a Beatrice Straight in NETWORK (1976, 8/10)? I highly doubt that will happen, as much as I want to see Fonda back in the Oscar podium, it is a long shot, but one plus side is that her role is right in the target for Oscar voters, a coattail nomination might not be a far-fetched dream. As for Weisz and Dano, doesn't have enough fodder to be the showstopper here.Sorrentino is a smart filmmaker, who plumps for stories about the privileged class, where Academy voters clearly belong, and making them feel relevant and contented about the fading memories, about getting old, about mundane pettiness and about nostalgia, without being perceptively incisive, that's why he has succeeded with THE GREAT BEAUTY, YOUTH unwittingly exposes him as a one-trick-pony, the second round is less admirable, but still passable to watch, yet I cannot say for sure for a third time, let's wait and see if I am right or wrong, and I do hope there will be a quantum leap to prove I am wrong.",7,1,5,8 November 2015
Cloverfield," Cloverfield
","As the instigator of pseudo-documentary horror/sci-fi, four-years later, I finally got the chance to watch it, stripped down to the film per se, a 80 minutes running time has testified the audience's extreme endurance toward the dizziness side effect thanks to the unbreakable Super 8 which could shoot 8 hours non-stop, surely with an ultra-battery. This J.J. Abrams co-produced work was a tremendous success in the spring box office at its time and astutely centers on a firsthand POV of a group of average Joes, facing an unknown monster ravaging Manhattan, in order to keep the DV on the spot, leading by a tacky individual heroism, four friends goes back into the danger zone to rescue another friend in the name of love, clearly casualties are inevitable, but the viscerally thrilling involvement is the chief payoff owing to the vivid participation out of the shaky disturbance along the entire excursion, say the night vision adventure in the metro tunnel is a highlight. Another great asset is the jaw-dropping SFX of the monster and the aftermath it creates, after tons of SFX mega-products' impetus, this relatively low-budget film could still get some awesome wows which is simply remarkable and at least on an equal level with J.J.'s own DV- intrigued supernatural monster thriller SUPER 8 (2011). Being a feigned fly-on-the-wall scheme, there is no room for scores except the solemn ending-credit 'CLOVERFIELD OVERTURE' from Michael Giacchino, a surprisingly remarkable piece of work which I was not expected at all. Anyway, I feel lucky I hadn't watch the film in a screen time of a multiplex, I highly doubt myself could sustain the upsetting 80 minutes, which prompts a more innovative wake-up call in the realm of technology progress, we are in desperate seeking of the further development of a stable DV, maybe when that time arrives, a remake will be on the agenda.",7,0,0,31 May 2012
Ready Player One," a kaleidoscopic RPG-VR enterprise heralds a future where live action and VR together can confect something unimaginably spectacular.
","Hooray gamers and geeks, Steven Spielberg's kaleidoscopic RPG-VR enterprise, based on Ernest Cline's eponymous YA novel, READY PLAYER ONE has already scooped a lucrative sum in its theatrical run, $582 million global grosses is such a coup for a standalone studio vehicle these days. In the near future, reality is a bummer, so most people immerses themselves in the VR universe called OASIS designed by the deceased genius James Halliday (Rylance, emulating a slightly listless Steve Jobs), for thrills and chills, where one can undergo vicarious experience through their game avatar, and our protagonist Parzival/Wade Watts (Sheridan, sorry, no marquee idol charisma can be sensed here), the former is his avatar name and the latter is his name in real life, is not just one of them, but the best by default, since we have zero doubt that he will bird-dog three hidden keys and eventually bags the sought-after Easter egg, all pre-ordained by Halliday and to a befuddling reincarnation in the climax, solely as a stream of consciousness (or is it not? the film remains evasive), to inherit OASIS against the unscrupulous competition from a corporate organization IOI (Innovative Online Industries), headed by Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn, gamely spiking mischievous self-awareness into the stereotyped antagonist), not without the help a contingent of fellow gamers, including his love interest Art3mis/Samantha (Cooke), his best friend Aech/Helen (Waithe, although her gender-swapping reveal loses its momentum amid the action-packed brouhaha offhand) and, naturally, two Asian side-kicks.Interestingly, it is not an exaggeration to call READY PLAYER ONE an animation predicated on its predominant VR contents, but in the eyes of a lay audience, it also obscures the line between mocap and pure digital creation, there are lingering resemblance between characters and their virtual avatars, but one cannot visually discern the difference (at least in this reviewer's case), yet, it is this seamless amalgamation of live action and virtual reality (definitely not its sophomoric plot) that puts the film on the map, it vigorously heralds a future where these two seemingly discrete strands can work together to confect something unimaginably spectacular.Conversely, allow me to detract from its technological innovation to something more retrospective, Spielberg cannily plays the cards of collective nostalgia ranging from baby boomers to Generation Z with a gallimaufry of pop culture staples (The Iron Giant, Mechagodzilla, King Kong, The Shining, Chucky, just to name a few which I can recollect from my limited knowledge pertaining to American pop culture, and practically with no inkling of the video game sphere), bombards us with over a hundred Easter eggs even the most keen-eyed aficionados ought to fall back on repeated viewings to pick them all out, so lucre from DVD purchase is on tap and a sequel, like as not, will be on the drawing board any day now.",7,1,2,25 July 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker Tailor Spy Soldier
","Saw this one in cinema eventually several days ago, as usual, I am totally ignorant to the eponymous worldwide bestseller novel or the BBC TV mini-series in 1979 starring Sir Alec Guinness. And my instant response when the ending-credits rolls is that it is too intricate for a feature film and with sustained jumping back and forth of the actual narrative, a first viewing could barely serve as an introduction. The grainy texture of the film is retro and unassuming, like its protagonist George Smiley, and a lengthy running time with tepid fixation to the minimal details are tiring, foolhardily devoid of any suspenseful theatrical stunt (the scene of file-theft in the Circus library could merely be qualified for the aim); sundry gory scenes of death are infelicitously irrelevant with the film's avowed self-effacing tone, anyway, the film is too hard-bitten for my digestion system in a way grating my patience and diminishing my interest. Nevertheless the film has bountiful merits to demonstrate that it has its offbeat appeal, particularly towards its cold-war spy genre buffs, a pervasive austere gray-blue palette could not be more emblematic for the back story and director Tomas Alfredson's (whose debut LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008 is an unsurmountable milestone for any budding directors) knack for manufacturing a stylized cine-atmosphere is unswerving, a love-it-or-hate-it aftermath is predestined. The acting is practical but underwhelmed, Gary Oldman is acclaimed merely because it is against his stereotyped flare-up spitfire, and due to an appalling shame he had never been nominated before this film, at any rate it is not a new fuss, just an unspoken consensus all the players comply. So I do sincerely wish this will not be Mr. Oldman's career peak as we all know he could do way better! Among a male-studded supporting cast, Mark Strong is remarkably excellent against that almost everyone character is in somewhat underdeveloped ellipsis (save for Smiley), also a thumb-up for Kathy Burke, who magically generates the one and only chuckling.I admire the effort, but the platitude is that not all masterpieces could be made into films, so a mixed feeling of unsatisfied still hovers.",6,2,2,8 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," Old tricks from Mr. Tarantino
","In post-mortem, if we must find a fall guy for the calamitous upshot of Tarantino's latest gory saga THE HATEFUL EIGHT, which of the hateful one do you pick? Without too much struggle, I will say it is the bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Russell), who insists on taking his quarries alive to see them hang, even in the case of Daisy Domergue (Leigh), who is wanted dead or alive. If only he could ape the fashion of his fellow black hunter Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), the story would have ended in a more insipid but undeniably more efficient and casualty-less note.The truth is, sometimes, once a certain reputation has been established, to alter it may not be all that easy even if it means less trouble involved for pragmatic reasons, and surely, John Ruth doesn't care for the easiest way, he sticks to his gun until he meets his maker. Or the same thing can be referred to Mr. Tarantino himself, who has become overwrought to retain his brand of overripe violence and loquacious confidence, which obstructs his attempt of going further.Tarantino's script is also cagey about the backstory of Daisy, what she has done to make her a wanted outlaw worth 10,000$, a quite obvious concern no one cares to broach during their over- elaborate political and radical prattle, even gauging by her last name alone, Ruth or Warren should have gotten an inkling about what could happen en route to their destination, a town called Red Rock in Wyoming. That is unfortunately a scriptsmith's job to pre-empt these inauspicious after- thoughts from audience, which rarely happens in Tarantino's previous output.This one-day stretch story occurs in the same time frame of Tarantino's previous DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012), a few years after the American Civil War, but structurally much more stage- oriented, with the preponderance of the happenstances being hemmed inside a stagecoach lodge (imitate a big soundstage) due to a blizzard outside, it tellingly reminds us of RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a similar whodunit trope (initiated by Tarantino's own voice-over) also takes place just when all the political rebuke, repetitive woman-beating, racist teases and gross provocation start to pall. A tangible intensity duly engages when a flashback chapter narrates the horrid slaughter happened earlier at the exact place, we were all haplessly sitting in the darkness, waiting for the blood-spluttering brutality to pour out. Afterwards, it goes without saying, no one can come out of the shoot-out unscathed, and a frontier justice (deliberately elucidated by Tim Roth's Oswaldo Mobray with an unsubtle Christoph Waltz impression, earlier in the casual padding) symbolically settles the score in the money shot, to suggest after all, there are righteous heroes in this trigger- happy milieu crammed with hateful individuals.The film is shot in the rare Ultra Panavision 70 process, credits must be given to its cinematography for its sporadic but grandiose snowscape by DP Robert Richardson, while most indoor shots are fluidly choreographed and unobtrusively operative. Much kudos to Morricone's Oscar-winning score as well, palpitates closely with the film's mood swings and flares up when the visual grandeur emerges.Jennifer Jason Leigh finally joins the Oscar-calibre echelon after being the most overlooked actress (as for as Oscar is concerned) of her generation, her performance here is unabashedly attention- grabbing, even when she is sitting there wordless, motionless, often chained with Russell's Ruth, she is enigmatic to regard (stunning makeup work here too), although her Daisy turns out to be out-and-out evil, when the crunch hits, there is a wishful thinking that she might get her way, not because we are rooting for her, but her feral, blood-covered ferocity is such a zinger on the screen, especially for female characters. Among the rest seven, Samuel L. Jackson is finally first-billed in a Tarantino's picture after a collaboration stretching over two decades, his swagger and flair is undeniably fetching, his arch ambivalence hangs tough until he gets shot in the balls (his manhood bravado gets its comeuppance). Walton Goggins, plays Chris Mannix, the supposed new sheriff of Red Rock, unexpectedly becomes the most important asset in the third act, in spite of an almost farcical front in his greenness, while all the others are typical Tarantino pawns, including the secret hateful No. 9, Channing Tatum.For my money, THE HATEFUL EIGHT can still quench the thirst of Tarantino's devout cinephiles, since he knows exactly what they want, the excesses of unrepentant gore, piled-up body counts and the psychological maneuver, but if you are intrigued to see if he has learned any new tricks, the answer will be disappointing.",7,1,4,10 October 2016
"I, Tonya"," I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle
","There is something unconscionably rebarbative in the factual story of Tonya Hardling (1970-) (Robbie), an erstwhile top-notch American figure skater who falls from grace in the wake of a physical assault inflicted to her fellow teammate/rival Nancy Kerrigan (Carver), with which she may or may not be involved, that is, it represents the most air-headed idiocy and indignity executed by those we might refer to as 'peckerwoods', for wanting of wits, conscience, compassion, even wiles, they are piteous for sure, but there is also a pithy Chinese adage, which can be roughly interpreted as: a poor person must have a detestable trait. Director Craig Gillespie briskly soups up this biopic with revelatory modi operandi of four-square faux-interviews and breaking-the-fourth wall gimmick to feed us prompt commentaries and wry afterthoughts apropos of its state of affairs from the subjects, an inviting tactic to piece together the less fluid chronological narratology. And the money-shots are certainly hinged on the re-enactments of Tonya's historical Olympic performances, and with a helping hand of cutting-edge CGI magic, despite on some occasions we can fairly discern the effect that Robbie's face is edited onto the gliding skater in the post-production, by and large, the filmmakers have done a cracking job to construct them with a scintillating cinematic sheen.  Apart from a physically backbreaking stunt for Robbie to pull off Tonya's aptitude on the ice rink, she weaves through the whole shebang with amazing verve and compelling agency, aided by a beneficial factor of the film's slant on Tonya: blameless in the scandal, and is not someone who is willfully refuses to play along with the tacit rule of figure skating, but simply she is just a different kettle of fish from those elected ice princesses to represent a nation's international image, a tragic figure falls victim of the dark and sanctimonious side of a typical American dream.  Consequentially, Robbie is proudly initiated as an Oscar nominated actress, which bullishly paves the way for her leading lady status among the Hollywood current echelon. But it is Allison Janney's Oscar-certified showstopper as a monstrously abusive mother that takes this reviewer aback (not in an entirely salutary sense though), as rewarding as to see a veteran of Janney's caliber finally pays her due to grasp the holy grail, her showy and bitter incarnation of LaVona Golden, Tonya's mother, ruefully overreaches the boundary between caricature and baring-it-out authenticity.Still and all, another monster in Tonya's life, Jeff Gillooly, her abusive first husband played by a smoldering Sebastian Stan, is left disproportionally unsung compared to the hailing laurels received by the two aforementioned ladies, in fact, Stan is far from a sub-par contributor to the film's hair-trigger dynamism, and rightfully, he transmits Jeff's pernicious influence with poise and a semblance of inner conflict that is so critical in a role's wholesome characterization, which is found wanting in both case of LaVona and Shawn Eckhardt (Hauser), the presumed barmy culprit whose presence only reminds us the nadir of human lunacy. By turns ebullient, over-the-top, rousing (partially thanks to Fleetwood Mac's infectious THE CHAIN), sardonic and archly cynical, I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle: we cannot choose our parents, but can we choose our own path then? Not really, as Tonya's story tells us, when something so hardwired such as one's upbringing, stands in your way, just suck it up and keep your heads above the water.",7,3,6,6 May 2018
Molly's Game," too avaricious in indulging its maker's ideology to its own good, however sagacious his intention is
","Aaron Sorkin's debut feature film lives and dies with a barnstorming Jessica Chastain, MOLLY'S GAME, based on the newsworthy true story of Molly Bloom, an athlete manqu√É¬©e who makes her name by organizing underground poker games for high-rolling punters (celebrities, businessmen, rich second-generation youngsters and mafias alike), first in L.A., then in New York, but cannot shuck off its consequences. A preamble of how Molly ended her mogul-skiing career is peppered with Sorkin's trademark oratory in machine-gun velocity through Molly's voiceover, tinged with mockery and pique. Years of harsh training from her magisterial father Larry Bloom (Costner, sustains a stern look all the time until a cathartic confession to reconnect the family tie) - her rancor-fested relationship with whom will get its dilatory payoff near the end, goes down the pan because of a slight oversight, this lesson hits Molly hard and actually actuates her with a high-risk taking, opportunist ambition to prove her (pecuniary) worth, that she is not a loser, yes, thanks to American's putrid winner-takes-it-all motto.Molly's subsequent road to accure lucre is totally contingent on her own acumen and moxie once she chances upon a money-spinner, she seizes upon it and aspirant enough to be her own boss when time fits, she is remarkably clear-minded to leave sex off the table, especially if we consider how inextricably it correlates with the life she inhabits, Sorkin clinically excises any sex-related content from Molly's rise-and-fall, and this conspicuity-by-its-own-absence is pregnant with many indications, not the least a lucid message to spurn the ubiquitous exploitation of gratuitous sex scenes in films, also it trenchantly points up the impersonal facade of Molly's enterprise, she works like a machine, circumspectly avoids any personal contact with those dastardly, well-minted gamblers, and its burning-the-cande-at-both-ends requisite also takes its toll in exacerbating Molly's drug addiction. Yet, at the end of the day, what she has seems so fragile and precarious if one of those arrivistes decides to leave her in the lurch just because he is offended by her ethical judgement or entangle her into legal actions when he is busted, although Molly is far with blameless in her own downfall, but to Sorkin's lights, it is this misogynous, ruthless frame-of-mind that victimizes her as a cog in the machine of profit-seeking capitalism and repugnant gambling jones. Chastain is indeed at the top of her game, albeit there are tints of kinship between the protagonists in this and MISS SLOANE (2016), both head-strong, opinionated women wrestles with a toxically patriarchal society that constantly diminishes women's values, here the story is more self-oriented and self-sufficient in Molly's own vivid experiences, Chastain continues to be a beacon in today's female screen presentation and yoked to Sorkin's prolix script, she is nonpareil, particularly in those less wordy moments where she manages to convey Molly's own trepidation and perplexity to elicit our empathy albeit the unsavory nature of the life she chooses to lead. Less rewarding is the two-hander between Molly and her lawyer Charlie Jaffey (Elba), where the latter feels strangely miscast with his towering stature going at odds with his apparently strained (albeit solicitous enough on the spot), short-breathed elocution, their chemistry never gives occasion to a legitimate boiling point, of which this overwrought convo-fest is much in need, by and large, MOLLY'S GAME is too avaricious in indulging its maker's ideology to its own good, however sagacious his intention is.",7,4,9,17 February 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," The Adventures of Tintin
","Strangely enough, this film is almost 2 months earlier here in Europe than its North American premier near the Christmas time(I watched it at 29th Oct with friends here), particularly this is a mammoth-budgeted blockbuster animation and not until I had finished it in the IMAX cinema, I become forthrightly certain that the sturdy word-of-mouth will allure even a larger audience into the theater during the Yuletide season and its US territory will be effortlessly seized like here in Europe. In fact, Tintin is just one of the two enthusiastically-hyped films from director Spielberg this year, WAR HORSE (still under its veil) will rush into the Christmas field as well with some more potential Oscar buzz. Now it's rather too early to predict which one is better, but aiming different spectators, I optimistically expect it will be a win-win situation, and basely according to my enraptured experience with Tintin, Spielberg is back at his top form after the universally- disappointing INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL in 2008. From the technique angle, this cutting edge performance-capture animation has surpassed any precedents which endeavor to blur the boundary between animated feature and real-person features. After the tepid responses from a clumsy pioneer FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRIT WITHIN (2001), Robert Zemeckis' misfired THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004) and BEOWULF (2007), Tintin is truly an innovative triumph, all the subtlety and details are represented immaculately with accuracy and verisimilitude. Thanks to this state-of-the-art cutting-edge advancement, seamlessly matches with the Indiana Jones-que adventure structure, being a non-fan of the original cartoon books, I was stupefied to witness the smoothly fabricated world, everything is miraculously tangible (my favorite part is with Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent eagle- chasing bravura) and the narrative doesn't lose its fuel until the very end, which leaves its audience no time for any distraction (as a matter of fact, it is indeed the story of Captain Haddock, Tintin is demoted as a sidekick during the latter part). We all know film is a world of imagination and somehow this film is foreboding that here comes the arch enemy of actors, high-tech could be the kryptonite of this glamorous yet sumptuous occupation, which had been proposed before when the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY first came into being! By the way, I cannot figure out Daniel Craig and Andy Sekis' voices in the film, I was pretty sure Craig could not be the villain, and it turned out to be my mistake! This is no question this is one of the best animation in this century, if the academy acknowledge its admission (accidentally news came out today Tintin is officially on the shortlist of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE category of next years' Oscar race), it will without any doubt be the definite front-runner!",9,1,5,5 November 2011

","Back to the drawing board after Sony opting for foreshortening THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise, and recruited into the ever-expanding Marvel Comic Universe, this Spider-Man re-redux features a new web-slinger Tom Holland, treads the same treacherous water of being repetitive (an aggregate of 6 stand-alone summer blockbusters in the past 15 years), but smartly angles for re- connecting with a sizably younger demography by coordinating Peter Parker as a high schooler and emphatically bowdlerizes his tragedy-laden original story (no mentioning of his parents, or the demise of uncle Ben, or how he acquire the superpower), after this new Spidey's scintillating debut in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016) as an amuse-bouche, now the main course is served, and the motto is let's go chipper! The prologue concisely dwells on the movie's main villain Adrian Toomes aka, Vulture (Keaton), an arms trafficker who has no ambition to lay waste to the world and wisely chooses to stay under the radar for his profiteering business of forging mass destructive weapons graced with extraterrestrial substances. The film kick-starts with the caption of 'a film made by Peter Parker', a fuzzy video shot by his phone which evinces his excitement of becoming an Avenger and he is all keyed up for the next big teamwork which seems to be indefinitely parked. So, life goes on, after all the thrills and spills dissipate, Peter is back on his neighborhood watch escapades, has his first crush on a senior student Liz (Harrier), and inadvertently reveals his secret identity in front of his best friend, the computer-savvy Ned (Batalon), director Jon Watts and his writers make sure there are sufficient gags and jokes to cosset upbeat youngsters and it is a decisive move to reinvigorate a markedly fatigued franchise. After several skirmishes with Vulture and his cronies, including a heroic rescue in the Washington Monument of his academic decathlon teammates, and a ferry fracas nearly causes great casualties, Peter is reprimanded by Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and his bespoke intelligent suit is confiscated. Becoming an Avenger seems hopeless at that point, but for a 15-year-older high schooler, there is something more imperative to do, for example, to invite Liz as his date in the homecoming dance. Only a twist will soon bring Peter face to face with Mr. Toomes, and an ensuing aerial-to-ground battle devised as the final showdown ultimately comes across as derivative and uninspiring, it is not such a compliment to the craftsmanship if one is constantly occupied with galling trivialities such as why Spidey's homemade suit is so durable or why the close-range combat is so inanely gore-less? Pitifully, this reboot isn't a real trooper to give a completely absorbing makeover of one of our most beloved comic heroes, or to shatter the status quo of the comics adaptation formula, although one can see that it has the potential to do so, Tom Holland is a beneficent choice to wear the suit, utterly down-to-earth and charmingly spontaneous, let's only hope he will not be typecast in the future. The whole cast is meritoriously inclusive, each character is given their distinctive individuality, and Michael Keaton, after his self-referential come back in BIRDMAN (2014), looks pretty self-paradoxical taking a fat check in this winged about-face, haranguing his much junior opponent with his faux-family value which belies a thinly veiled egoism and callousness, as a villain, he has his matter-of-fact tack but nonetheless, slumps into an old chestnut when it comes to profit and confrontation.",7,2,3,15 August 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove
","According to Morrissey's recent manifestation 'more gay people, more peaceful the world', war is the malicious ramification of heterosexual men's urge to kill their peers (I'm paraphrasing here), which tallies germanely with this Kubrick's black war satire. Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti- communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union's ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick's masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers' political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease. Running within 100 minutes, the film slickly unreels its storyline with great force of dark humor which imbues parodic and even cartoonish idiosyncrasies to the permeating machismo in the air. Peter Sellers' three-faceted versatility, George C. Scott's Communism-slamming extravaganza and Sterling Hayden's trigger-happy paranoia plus Slim Pickens' cowboy hat, the ensemble cast owns their respective frantic glory within a compacted steak of time, umpteen gags and mockeries can be savored ad infinitum, Sellers'British accent (as Group Captain) when confronting Sterling's General Rippers is unimpeachably spontaneous, Keenan Wynn's coca-cola joke is pertinently deadpan serious and Sterling's conspiracy theory about water fluoridation and the fearful deprivation of life essence during a sexual intercourse (the man just cannot face his natural aging mechanism of the body) are plainly golden ideas, outlandish but vividly rib-tickling, and astringently self-reflective.Kubrick's trademark set design which would prevail in his later color features has not fully exploited this black-and-white war farce, and the (not-too-obvious) misogyny and chauvinism overtone does impede the sensitive nerves a bit, nevertheless, it is not my favorite Kubrick's film, but it is an outstanding comedy which I presume can stay untainted by numerous re-watches, for me the first round is more than gratifying and since my generally inert resistance towards war-related films, a second round may take some time despite of its overall peerlessness.",8,0,1,4 March 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Fast & Furious 6
","Watched this one in the local multiplex, honestly I am not an avid fanboy of this money-maker franchise, I am even not an advocate of racing vehicles, but the turning point comes when FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) surprisingly catapults itself into a new level of sensory entertainment with its roller coaster ride and triumphantly revives the series' mass appeal to a younger generation and has grossed a series-high income means it has yet overstayed its welcome. Still helmed by Justin Lin, this 6th sequel reunites all the cast, including one of the 'original four' Michelle Rodriguez, whose wacky insomnia and vague backstory stirs the most untenable veneer of the plot if one can excuse the physics-defying action sequences as an utmost drawing power to allure new genre lovers and retain its core audiences. So a large drawback of this one is it is solely made for one's eyes only, one should completely ignore what is the convoluted plot going on by the villain and his cohorts and plainly indulge oneself in the great stunt work to find it is worth your ticket. Unequivocally it is a tough job for any writer to create new blood for the franchise since it allows very limited leeway to inspire from the original cast, and due to the aesthetic fatigue, sooner or later, a younger cast must be mustered so as to invigorate a healthy metabolism for the faded set pieces. In this one, the newcomer is a strapping Luke Evans as the main villain, whose temperament presages a brighter future as a leading man candidate in world cinema, but unfortunately this film is not his breakthrough, at most a stepping stone permits him to be seen by more people and hence enlarges his fan base. Everyone else is pigeonholed with their respective task, Johnson bullies scumbags, Diesel emotionlessly sweet-talks with his comeback battle-axe, Walker retreats into a family man, Gibson and Ludicrous are the pair of cutups, the ass-kicking martial pro Carano is here for girl fights while Kang and Gadot cannot run away from their functional exit, which plausibly introduce another bankable name as the next villain for the next chapter, due next year and will be transferred to be under the reign of horror-genre whiz James Wan, let's pray for a miracle to sustain its longevity and if we are lucky enough, a better one next time!",6,1,2,31 July 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Stunning
","What's a heartbreaking fairy tale! It's definitely one of the best films of 2006, I'm so pleased it won 3 Oscars a few weeks ago, and as I also love 'The Lives Of Others', so I'm not so shocked by its winning best foreign film over 'Pan's Labyrith', and as a matter of fact, that's the perfect result.Since this film has been so popular these days, i will just skip the scenario and say something after watching it for 2 times, I hardly watch a film more than once in such a short interval while I have so many films to watch and too little time to finish this mission-impossible.As the scenes are changing between the real cruel revolution war and imaginary fantasy world, that's to say, really a tough task for the photography, and this movie rocks because it's perfectly well done at this aspect. Also the amazing visual effects of the mythical parts, totally stunning! The portrait of characters is also worthing acclaim, especially for Sergi Lopez as the sinister Captain, Sergi shines in every scene he is in, his cocky arrogance and brutal deviltries are vivid enough to leave a deep impression in my heart. And I also find Maribel Verbu stands out as a strong, righteous undercover maid, she is aging so severely compared to in 'And Your Mother Too', perhaps it's the makeup and the rugged clothes she wears. But a very powerful performance! Besides, the young new actress Ivana Baquero also gives a decent performance as the innocent girl.And one annoying thing in the plot is that the little girl cannot resist the lure of delicious grapes even she is warned before, I know it's maybe hard to make it plausible, and it's just the need for the storyline, I think this is quite a big flaw there and really bothers me, if not for that, I will give it a 10/10 rating.In my deep heart I am a pessimistic person and lack of confidence, I feel terribly sorry for the ending, not because I don't believe in fairy tales, but I cannot get rid of the shadows of death that occupies all over my mind. In a world like today, really hard for me to be cheered up, this film teach us some different way of regarding life and the world, see the bright side and meantime don't forget the dark one, this could the perfect dilemma for human beings to handle with and enjoy it. Live in pain but happily! Suddenly a strange signal came through my mind, I should watch 'Borat' sometime! Omg, this has never occurred to me before!",9,3,6,18 March 2007
Begin Again," a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas
","From Irish director/writer John Carney (also the of the indie dark-horse ONCE (2006, 8/10), BEGIN AGAIN is an urban symphony of NYC, stars two bankable names of Knightley & Ruffalo. Originally titled CAN A SONG SAVE YOUR LIFE?, which is more literal to describe the chance meeting between Dan Mulligan (Ruffalo) and Gretta James (Knightley), Dan is a damaged good, with the usual trappings, a middle-aged man abandoning himself to alcohol, separated with her wife Miriam (Keener) and distanced with their teenage daughter Violet (Steinfeld), once a promising executive of an indie record label, but now he is just fired by his business partner Saul (Bey) in the presence of Violet. It is the worst day of his life, and he is seriously considering to end his own life until he watches Gretta performing her own song in a bar, he is immediately attracted by her unsophisticated frankness in her music, and decides to sign her (although this is not up to him and he brings her to Saul to see if they can reach for a record deal).For Gretta, the day they meet is assumed to be her last day in NYC, the next day she would fly back to Britain, her homeland. She has experienced a breakup with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Levine), who has become a big shot in the city and cheated on her. When Saul is hesitate to sign her, Dave proposes a crack idea to live-recording an entire album al fresco, they recruit a band and then record songs in an alley, on a rooftop and various other locations. The two grow closer and a budding romance is appositely honed up when they share each other's personal play-lists while wandering on the street, yet, Carney calmly puts a stop in this corny route through Gretta's realisation that it would only be a fling between them, and obviously Dave is still hankering to reconcile with Miriam and they should be a happy family. Meanwhile, Gretta also needs to figure out the mess with Dave, who is remorseful for his wantonness and intends to win her back after Gretta leaves him a song in his voice-mail. After witnessing Dave's live performance of LOST STARS (Oscar-nominated!), which is written by Gretta, in front of an enchanted audience, she finally has the epiphany that she cannot be a part of Dave's new rock star lifestyle, a painful closure seems to be the right thing to do. Finally, their album is accomplished, but Gretta opts for an alternative distribution circuit, she decides to sell the album in 1$ exclusively through internet, and it turns out to be a smash while Dave and Miriam reconnect their romance. Although the success of the album is a bit implausible and only can happen in a fanciful mind, otherwise the original soundtrack would become a much more sought-after commodity, apparently, one must love the soundtrack to take this film as a guilty pleasure, nevertheless, it is definitely a soothing experience to see Knightley in her most relaxed state against an always-unobjectionable Ruffalo, and it is a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas - we are all lost stars, a speck of dust within the galaxy, trying to light up the dark.",7,0,0,7 August 2015
Horrible Bosses," Horrible Bosses
","Too raunchy to be applauded and appreciated, this slapstick ragbag squeezes a whiff of middling laughters while all its characters are in deficit of credibility (compared with BRIDESMAIDS 2011). The film typifies that while possessing an engrossing notion, it falls short of imagination and practical measures to present it into a gleeful feature-length work, a filmmaker's block? Surely it is. The glistening cast presents a leading-star-playing-wacky-supporting-role pattern, passably attracts their most loyal groupies and also intrigues many non-comedy cinema-goers to witness the fervently hyped overturn of these stars. Quite a cunning move and ostensibly it has functioned (a worldwide gross $209,638,559 is purely stunning). Plot-wise, Jennifer Aniston's section is too weak to be taken for granted, particularly for a hamsterishly squeaky Charlie Day (she's way out of his league, right?), nevertheless, this part is most laughable and refreshing. Kevin Spacey practically plays a main villain in it, 12 years after American BEAUTY 1999, his second spring woefully has arrived yet, a full-out one-dimensional asshole simply cannot pay his dues. As for Colin Farrell, one should chuckle that he doesn't own much screen time, his outfit is tellingly steals his thunder. The film could have been more authentic (e.g. replace Aniston with some eye-broccoli cypher, excise the unfunny gags with ass-brush or anything relates the organ, don't make Jason Sudeikis's character a moronic sex-addict etc¬Ö.), but pitifully the markets crammed with run- of-the-mill pictures (check the top 10 of the northern American box office at the rotten tomatoes last week, no single film was able to procure a fresh status, an after-awards-season syndrome?), which targets different audiences, even though for people who only looks for shallow laughters in the cinema, the film faintly undercuts its audience, mercifully not much. Should we expect a sequel? simply because of its ultra-appealing fodder, since we all aware that horrible bosses are ubiquitous among our species.",5,3,7,17 March 2012
The Town," The Town: 7/10
","This is Ben Affleck's sophomore film as a director, unlike its predecessor GONE BABY GONE (2007), this time he also takes the leading role. Generally speaking, I think Ben is on his way to become next Clint Eastwood and could be more appropriate as a director than an actor although he delivers a quite convincing performance most of the time, nevertheless, in a much more encouraging extent, this film delightedly proves that Ben Affleck is competent as a more versatile director. The heist story can not be a novelty, the whole return of a prodigal son is a mere platitude, to my surprise I do enjoy the entire process although 150 minutes is a tad too long (I saw the DVD extended cut), the film has yet achieved a sparkling success on the box office, ($91,947,016, North American alone, which is a prodigious leap from GONE BABY GONE $20,300,218). The shining star of the film is Jeremy Renner, given the fact that his role is a stereotyped bandit, but his portrayal endows his character a very intense collision against others (especially in a positive way to steal the thunder of poor Ben); Rebecca Hall again solidifies her status as the best among her peers, the sparks between her and Ben are adorable and make everything unbelievably convincing. Blake Lively also contributes her dramatic turn as a low-class prostitute with a baby girl; by contrast, Ben's acting is not worth mentioning. The film is well-done from all aspects (particularly the cinematography and the rapid but precise editing), my only complain is that there is nothing new or ideographic from the genre, good luck on the Oscars next year!",7,0,1,27 December 2010
Suicide Squad," a superhero mix-bag fatigue
","SUICIDE SQUAD, conspicuously hits a nadir in its feedback from critics, which officially raise the curtain of the battle-of-wits between DC franchises and carping pundits, perhaps it will be wiser for their next projects to skip the early critics screenings, if their claim of those films are made for die-hard comic books fans is sincere, who cares about critics then? The only problem is, the die-hard fanbase alone cannot cough up enough doughs to cover its hefty production budget, and since it is all about money, one might expect some sea change will soon befall from their grandee decision makers.This time, one must concur with the critics, maybe in light of a seriousness-bucking freshness wrought by Marvel's DEADPOOL (2016) into the ever-blas√© superhero glut earlier this year, audience's surged expectancy towards SUICIDE SQUAD has reached a threshold of inevitable ricochet. There is something frustratingly by-the-numbers in this supposedly paradigm-shifting entertaining fare where a ragtag cluster of characteristic antiheroes are reluctantly mustered together - in this case, a bomb is implanted in their neck, which can be detonate by Colonel Red Flag (Kinnaman, looks impeccably high-minded, ) if they rebel or try to escape -, to work for the US government and save the world from an impending doom from a sorceress-deity Enchantress (Delevingne).Top hit-man Deadshot (Smith) and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Robbie) are among the expendables who predictably get the star treatment with a more generous story arc and screen- time, but Smith doesn't comes off so much a merciless mercenary than a traditionally valued family man who solely happens to be a marksman. As for Robbie, the current 'it' girl in Hollywood, her over-merchandised impersonation of Quinn's bi-polar bearings patently stands out among the assembly, not because she is phenomenal, only the competition isn't challenging enough. Yet, the biggest disappointment is Jared Leto's Joker, short-changed in screen-time notwithstanding, his pompous performance is hammy to high heaven, menace and romantic vibes between Joker and Harley Quinn are both in dire dearth. Courtney's Captain Boomerang is the only member who betrays a whiff of unpredictability in his veins, whereas a penitent Diablo (Hernandez), being the only one who actually is bestowed with super power amongst the squad, follows a stock plot device, awakes from his shell of self-punishment (for his own sins) to embrace his power to battle the evil.A stony-faced Viola Davis plays Amanda Walker, a government agent abides by her own gray-area philosophy and wantonly overstays her welcome, and a long-standing villain problem in the superhero assembly-line doesn't ameliorate at all, numberless and faceless minions are basically weapon-less moving targets to boost the gang's close-combat dexterity, and motivation-aside, is Enchantress's swaggering portal-opening parade a blatant homage to the original GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)? Also the inundating score from Steven Price during the heightened battle is insufferable. Concisely, SUICIDE SQUAD is unintelligently oscillating between a costly cult caterer and a pulpy mainstream appeaser, and as it often turns out, it fial to reach both sides.",6,1,2,23 August 2016
Shutter Island," A sterling genre thriller needs multiple viewing
","Scorsese and DiCaprio's fourth collaboration, SHUTTER ISLAND is an on-the-edge-of-the-seat nail-biter, a period thriller situates at the titular island near Boston in 1954, a patient mysteriously disappears from the mental hospital on the island, draws the investigation of US marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his subordinate Chuck Aule (Ruffalo). But on the sly Teddy volunteers the task under a more personal motivation, he is after a pyromania who is responsible for the killing of his wife Dolores (Williams). But little does he know, what he experiences will turn his whole sanity upside-down, and blur the dichotomy between realness and illusion, in doing so, it also challenges audience's judgment of taking sides, a brainwashing hoax or an unorthodox therapeutic maneuver, and the ending testifies there is a right answer'Is it better to live as a monster or die as a good man?'. Teddy is obsessed with his conviction that the island is surreptitiously doing immoral experiments on their patients, to reform and manipulate their minds, due to his own military history during WWII and the trauma caused by Dolores' death, it seems rational enough for us to open a sympathetic ear for his pursuit, yet Scorsese deployed many evident glitches along the suspenseful narrative to suggest otherwise (with transitory editing tricks). When a hurricane sweeps the island and leaves no one exit the island, the film goes into a murky maze to screw up Teddy's mentality, the dream episodes where Dolores recurring as an ashen ghost and the horrific massacre in the WWII front comes to fore with indelible gore and grimness; the return of the missing patient Rachel (Mortimer) who is a murderess killed her three children, and the ominous lighthouse where the truth is insidiously hidden, not to mention the unusually odd atmosphere between Teddy and the rest of the people (the staff and patients), all indicate that it is too big a scheme to be covered up by a single conspiracy theory. The uniformly engaging DiCaprio brings about consistent effort to lead or mislead us into his consciousness as a heroic marshal in order to divulge some unscrupulous activities, counterbalances the interventions of the film's not-too-subtle indications, his committed endeavor is the driving force and all the supporting group is equally strong, Clarkson and Earle Haley leave great impact in their short appearance as either a red herring or a truth betrayer, Kingsley and Ruffalo disguise their real intentions under a restrained pleasantry, while von Sydow unleashes a layer of vile confrontation, which enchants the entire enigma with a more mysterious and befuddling aura. But by and large it is a Martin Scorsese's film, a brilliant genre piece coherently inveigles its viewers to immerse into its maelstrom and exit with a thorough emotional catharsis, which is definitely not every industrial hack is able to achieve!",8,0,2,11 May 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," awful 3D, sturdy action flick
","Funny thing is that I haven't watch CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011), but the raving reviews of this sequel lured me into the cinema, but unfortunately monopolized by a 3D- exclusive treatment here in Egypt. First of all, what is the real motivation behind the scheme of Alexander Pierce (Redford), the evil mind working for the HYDRA organization, the foe of the S.H.I.E.L.D. apparatus? Randomly obliterate a few citizens, for what? As in THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), probably in the entire Marvel's kingdom, it gets harder and harder to create any refreshing motive for its super-villains, sometimes, all the intelligence of those sinister brains is undercut by manufacturing overly- elaborate and secretive schemes which end up in as some more or less preposterous mess. Anyway, it is not a main problem since the picture is a superlatively polished action flick, laden with stunning visual spectacles, anything else all reduces to plot device to impel the narrative slide on its designed trajectory as planned. Captain America is an avatar of American spirit, but fundamentally he is a WWII relic who is adapting a strange world, unlike Tony Stark (the spendthrift tycoon), Thor (a gallant deity) or The Hulk (a mutant scientist), he may fall into the category of being too fair and square, there is no dark side in him, that's why Bucky, the Winter Solider (Stan) has been deployed to trigger a poignant bromance which exceedingly exploits the latest trend of male-bonding fantasies. Chris Evans is a deft action star and conforms to the token as an orthodox American Hero, while Sebastian Stan blends his pretty-face daze with the ruthless killing instinct in a credible way which secures his further involvement with Marvel's adventurous bigger plan. Underused in THE AVENGERS, Black Widow (Johansson) is another stand-out in the show, she is not a sidekick (a definite co-lead role with astonishing action sequences to flaunt her awesome elasticity) and deserves her own independent franchise, hopefully Johansson can be the first triumphant female superhero on the big screen, 10 years ago, I would wager on her being an Oscar winner by now other than a sui generis action star, her career path is rather interesting. Falcon (Mackie) is the bonhomous sidekick, a true black superhero should also be on the slate now. Robert Redford is urbanely vicious and we would love to see the devil is actually among real human beings (not some mutants, aliens or robots). Samuel L. Jackson finally has several minutes of his own moment with some ass-kicking car chase scenes which instigates the first high point of the picture. Director-duo Anthony & Joe Russo (from TV sensations COMMUNITY and Arrested DEVELOPMENT) did an amazing job (please ignore their previous filmography), it is a white- knuckle experience congested with fun, excitement and sincere emotion, I would give it a sounding 8 out 10 if and only if it was not in the sloppy 3D format, burden added but no benefits at all, alas, a distasteful shtick to charge more admission fee, which is over-abused in the money-grubbing business presently, not a good sign for film lovers.",7,0,2,7 April 2014
Life of Pi," a 10 out 10
","I cannot overpower my very own purist's paranoia, I watched this film in theater a few days earlier in dubbed Italian (my Italian level is so-so), I could not reckon that any film has been officially 'viewed' until I have watched it in its original form, so thanks to the latest BluRay copy, finally I am able to hail LIFE OF PI as my current favorite film of 2012! Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced. Back to the film itself, I am pretty oblivious to Yann Martel's source novel, but Ang Lee and his crew has deserved every single accolade because the outcome is simply astounding and mind-blowing, from the exotic Indian zoo, the palette of liveliness and quietude seeps directly to viewer's mind curves, then, the visual stunts take over, the minutiae are constructed into an inconceivable kaleidoscope of sea survival (ship-wrecking, heaven-like sea surface, carnivore island).The allegorical storyline which can be laconically recapitulated as 'the story between a boy and a Bengal tiger floating on the sea', also goes beyond one's mundane imagination, the liaison between Pi and Richard Parker the tiger has gone through a minute incubation-to- transition cliffhanger (technically it is not a cliffhanger since we all know the ending beforehand, but the two-hander just conjures magic spell upon us, which is mesmerizing, eye-popping and heart-warming), with the brilliant first-time actor Suraj Sharma interacting viscerally with the green screen (an almost entirely CGI-germinated tiger heralds the auspicious retirement of all the animal cast, as long as money continues investing, leave those poor animals in peace and so are the ever-engaging animal activist). Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances. Being an agnostic, Pi's eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn't register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be 'a story could make one believe in God', the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as 'religions'is concerned. The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly- recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee's versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible.",10,9,16,11 March 2013
Tangled," Tangled Vs. Brave
","Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above). Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively 'Disney' prince with a thief background. But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap. Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her 'mother' Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her 'mother' as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography. So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its 'no guts no glory' premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe 'why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy', in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge. Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se. Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film. As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale.",6,0,9,11 December 2012
Doctor Strange," Another solid brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall
","DOCTOR STRANGE, this latest MCU addition, officially takes audience to a more cerebral plane of brainy Sci-Fi concepts such as spiritual dimensions, astral world, immortality, eye of Agamotto, time-bending superpower, infinite time loop, etc. through the induction of the esoteric Oriental mystics, passed by The Ancient One (Swinton) in Nepal onto the elite New York neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), whose hands have been fatally injured in a car crash, and initially he seeks for a magic cure to grant him a way back to the operation table, before soon he will be saddled with a more challenging responsibility (the Siamese twin of power), to save humanity from ruination. So a resultant reaction from a non-comic reader, there is simply too much to ingest at a clip. Hubris is Dr. Strange's fault-line, he has earned himself a God-like competency to save patients under critical conditions and (both inwardly and outwardly) gloats about it. Subtextually, that could be the reason why the goddess of fate and destiny decides to mete out punishment by taking away his ability. Humility is the ultimate salvation he need to foster along with his sorcerous training, it always takes some time for our hero to realize that. As the introduction piece of Dr. Strange, the movie adopts a common-or-garden narrative arc to detail Stephen's transformative journey, his romantic tangles with co-worker Christine Palmer (McAdams) serves only as a side dish, but one must give credit to Palmer's 'don't explain to me what is happening' precept, that is a life-saver, the less she knows, the more likely she will survive in the sequels. The most enthralling nugget from this 14th entry of MCU is its paradigm-shifting, kaleidoscopic vista (although risking of being a deja-vu from Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION 2010) juggling with horizontal-vertical landscape mirror shifting, gravity-flouting kung-fu fighting, eye-opening out-of- body experience and stellar astral dimension, where dwells the super-villain Dormammu, who in fact, is devised with a bathetic exit strategy which foregrounds this ever-so-frustrating superhero genre's ingrained villain quandary, they all must appear too-big-to-fail with their omnipotence and doomsday menace, although no one in the audience would give a second thought about their invariably pre-designed defeat, to a degree it is impossible for deus-ex-machina to be plausibly brought to save the day. The cast accomplishes a solid job, Cumberbatch is an accent-wizard, and pleasurable enough to keep his Cloak of Levitation in his benevolent mien with a touch of egotism still needs to shed. Ejiofor is underused as Stephen's mentor-degraded-to-sidekick Karl Mordo, whose loyalty turns sour in the aftermath to anticipate the next chapter (we should never break the law of nature!). Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is a very Shakespearean villain, excels in his own narcissistic soliloquy (Hannibal style), while his acolytes are not allowed to deliver even one line besides fighting and running. However, it is Swinton's ageless incarnation as The Ancient One raises the roof, she is a guru, a mystic, a leader, a warrior and an enigma all in the same time, one can only beef why her character should be so unceremoniously dispatched after her indomitable entrance piece, just because her mission is fulfilled after Stephen assumes the mantle? That is a disgrace. Another brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall, DOCTOR STRANGE is visually inventive, but story-wise unambitious, yet, his idiosyncratic sorcerer background could be welled mapped out onto a more heterogeneous cinematic scope, to elicit something substantially reinvigorating from an over-familiar, one-dimension confined THE AVENGERS' assembly.",7,2,5,7 November 2016
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's indomitable piece of cinematic wonder,
","Kubrick's 3-hours epic about ups-and-downs of an Irish young man Redmond Barry (O'Neal) in the eighteenth century, narrated through an even-tempered and quite pleasing voice-over (Hordern), Barry is a farm boy raised by his mother (Kean) after lost his father in a duel, his puppy love with cousin Nora Brady (Hamilton) is curbed when Nora decides to marry Captain John Quin (Rossiter), who is able to pay for family debuts; an ensuing duel with John forces him to run away, but soon he is mugged penniless and joins the British Army and fights in the Seven Year's War (1756-1763), shell-shocked in the savagery of war, he takes French leave and takes on a a new identity, after a lovey-dovey time with a German wife Lischen (K√∂rner), his disguised is exposed by Captain Potzdorf (Kr√ºger), and is forced to join the Prussian Army. Then, things seem to be rosy after Barry shows his bravery and gains the trust of Potzdorf. After the war, he is sent to spy on a gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Magee) who also shares the Irish lineage, for whom he double-crosses Potzdorf and becomes his collaborator in the gamble games, eventually Chevalier brings him back to Britain where he woos the affluent Lady Lyndon (Berenson), and divided by an intermission, now starts the second half of his story - where many tragedies is awaiting for him. A thematic through-line is Barry's single-minded pursuit to be a nobleman, in the first half, his chivalry wins him admiration in the fist combat among soldiers, but in the real war there is no place for nobility, the gallant facade of infantry being used as canon fodder is ludicrous to comprehend, and a tease to the royal formality. So, as an upstart who marries a rich woman whom he barely loves, Barry is not that clever, since he is never cognizant of the simple fact that the snobbish upper class doesn't welcome parvenus, a significant ally should be his wife, if he cares to manifest his devotion and affections. But now his name is Mr. Barry Lyndon, all he needs is a title to secure the wealth for him and their young son Bryan (Morley), yet his philandering predisposition drives Lady Lyndon away and a critical chasm under the roof is between him and Lord Bullingdon (played by Savage and Vitali in different ages), Lady Lyndon's son from a previous marriage, who will bring about his undoing in the future where Barry becomes a miserable failure who eventually falls from the rank of a gentleman.One of the highly acclaimed aspects of this film is the lavish set production and inspiringly beguiling cinematography, the candle-lit scenes in the second half in particular, various tableaux vivants in stunning period costumes, imbues a transcendent beauty which intoxicates Barry and viewers alike, although underneath the finery, lies the stone-hearted defence system of a dying species. Duel is a key element in the film, from the opening one which dispatches Barry's father, to the one with John which kickstarts Barry's wandering adventures until the final one between him and Lord Bullingdon, which engagingly foregrounds Barry's flawed benevolence in sharp contrast with Bullingdon's craven and vengeful nature of an aristocrat. Also, a kind warning to those well-heeded families, don't ever let your young kids ride a horse, this and GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) are two brutal examples.BARRY LYNDON might fall short as a perfect epic because of it casts O'Neal as the lead, at the age of 33, he is mortifying in the opening when he supposes to be no more than a teenager, but thankfully, it transforms smoothly when Barry ages through the journey, but rarely his performance can galvanise the screen in the protracted duration, wanting of charisma debars audience from projecting a certain amount of sympathy to him, which is a dangerous defect for its epic scale. Even more befuddling is Berenson's Lady Lyndon, who only have a few lines altogether and is one-sidedly portrayed as a mistress who has no talent in governing her man, her children and her wealth, suffice to be Kubrick's last nail in the coffin for the doomed royalty. Numerous supporting characters come and go, barely have their scene-stealing moments, bar Leon Vitali's adult Lord Bullingdon, who is brilliant in the duelling part, Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, whose malicious appearance is the barometer of haughtiness and Marie Kean as Barry's mother, unwittingly eggs him on to his ruin. Another chief accolade should be given to Leonard Rosenman, the music adaptor who won an Oscar for wondrously concatenating Kubrick's favourites classical pieces into the epic length, embellishes the narrative seamlessly and becomes the ballast for a great viewing experience. Winning four Oscars, BARRY LYNDON is notably being the most acknowledged features of Kubrick, but ironically, Kubrick lost all three nominations under his name (BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY). Probably not his best work, but unmistakably, it is an indomitable piece of cinematic wonder, not just for its exquisite etiquette, also an influential fable about breaking the royal orders.",8,2,2,12 August 2015
Interstellar," it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan!
","By no means I am a scientific geek, my days of tackling with science has been fortuitously truncated years ago, so putting aside all these heatedly discussed astrological concepts, to be specific, wormhole, black hole, tesseract, the fifth dimension and time travel relativity (thanks to the enormous contribution of Dr. Kip Thorne), INTERSTELLAR is a potent analogue of Nolan's previous stunning visual and conceptual extravaganza INCEPTION (2010, 9/10), which looks deep into the bizarre inner activity within one's dream realm, but this time, Nolan's scope is going the opposite direction, extended outwardly to the unknown universe and based on a more perceivable future of the earth's imminent doom (we are all the culprits of various degrees in this scenario), it is not just an awe-inspiring outer-space odyssey, in its dual storyline, the life on earth is phenomenally linked by human's primitive force - love. I didn't watch the film on an IMAX screen, which in Cairo is quite scarce, and Cairo is a big city, but I have no gripe to watch it on a normal 2D screen since it is fantastically overwhelming just the same. In the pre-space trip , ex-pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (McConaughey) is staying with his two children, Murph, short for Murphy (Foy) and Tom (Chalamet) with his father-in-law Donald (Lithgow), while their world is experiencing extreme weather catastrophe such as sand storms, the father-and-daughter bond between Cooper and Murph has been intensified through their similar attitude towards science and the supernatural episodes happened in Murph's room, where she claims there is a 'phantom' using gravity to send her messages, which is such an ingenuous yet inconspicuous maneuver to foreshadows the mind-blowing twist in the black hole, and unthinkably it becomes the key to save all the humanity on earth. The emotional crunches are prepped with incredible performance, again, McConaughey is unbelievably trans-formative as the loving father who decide to reunite with Murph and keep his promises against all odds, his supreme reaction shots when reading messages for the past 23 years from Tom and Murph on earth are his Oscar-baiting moments, it seems the McConaussance has not been slowing down and one Oscar statue seems not enough at all. Mackenzie Foy plays the young Murph, Chastain is her adult version and Burstyn gives the final happy ending as the senior one. Chastain is a relentless fireball, formidably interprets the most arcane part (the telepathic revelation of who is the phantom?) which sometimes even challenges its own credibility, it is not a showy role for Chastain's caliber, nevertheless she is excellent in it, take one example, the minute facial nuances when Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) telling her the disturbing truth in his deathbed are handled with almost undetectable forbearance yet viewers can maximally sense the repercussions since it shakes all her belief in one second. Foy is equally brilliant as the young Murph, she sets a solidified base with Cooper, which sustains the mainstay of the film's critical emotional core and guides us through the transcendent experiences with Cooper, and a new child star is officially born. Hathaway's Brand, although second billed, surprisingly doesn't have too much to offer as the co-pilot, sometimes even becomes a corny nuisance (poor Wes Bentley!), there is another type of father-daughter undercurrent (she and Caine) which the film largely dodges. During Cooper's expedition to find suitable planet for earthlings, there is the punned 'Murphy's Law' effect subsequently occurs, Matt Damon's classified cameo is well-kept from the trailer and his appearance further cements his recent string of involvement with Sci-Fi genre (after THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU 2011, 6/10, ELYSIUM, 2013, 7/10 and Terry Gilliam's THE ZERO THEOREM 2013, next year he will be in Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN with Chastain), his Dr. Mann is the revered pioneer in the project, however it is through him, Nolan builds the only real villain (arguably Caine the big fat liar is condemnable as well), who succumbs to human frailties under the extreme condition, his motive is understandable, any of us could make the same move under his condition, that's why the film is so precious, one has to overcome all the innate barriers to achieve something extraordinary, say without this commitment with Murph, without the uninhibited love for her daughter (poor Tom, his father never even mention him at all), maybe Plan B is the future for human race, and the cruelty is freshly in our face. After GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), we reach a new monumental peak for the cosmic cinematography, pairing with a new DP Hoyte Van Hoytema (from HER 2013, 8/10; TINKER TAILER SOLIDER SPY 2011, 6/10, THE FIGHTER 2010, 8/10 and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008, 9/10), Nolan's galactic wonders are sufficiently groundbreaking, the three planets they visit bear simplistic topography grafted with inconceivable excesses, and the final homeland, the distorted proportion, all evokes the striking variations in INCEPTION. And if Alfonso Cuar√≥n can win BEST DIRECTOR for GRAVITY, Nolan is much more deserving, I am firmly standing behind Nolan's back this, it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan dares to make these 'impossible and grand venture' to enlighten our imagination and edify our own consciousness as a human being in this imperfect world, with the prowess of love we all possess, however small we are individually, there is hope always beckoning, eternally.",9,5,10,22 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers
","British filmmaker Martin McDonagh's third feature, TBOEM whisks audience off to an American whistle stop of an unspecified time, possibly in the 90s, since the last client of the titular billboards was from 1986 until our protagonist, a grief-driven Mildred Hayes (McDormand), rents them with texts 'Raped while dying', 'And Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?' painted in crimson red, as a vehement remonstrance to the slow-in-progress investigation of her murdered 20-year-old daughter Angela (Newton). The recipient Police Chief Willoughby (Harrelson, the real top-form supporting player here to spew blood and blow heads), on the other hand, is ailed by the impending mortality in the form of cancer, who is not a slouch professionally speaking, on the contrary, he is beloved by the populace, and expresses his resolution to track down the murderer, unfortunately Angela's case is in paucity of both evidence and witness, teetering on the edge of becoming a cold one, and when he is unable to carry on the investigation, the baton is taken up by Jason Dixon (Rockwell), a racist cop who undergoes a major redemptive turnabout thanks to a letter written by Willoughby. In this bifurcating narrative, one centers on Mildred's militant reactions in the face of the inconsolable bereavement, the ramifications of her contentious advertisement, which bear on the tension between her and her son Robbie (Hedges), ex-husband Charlie (Hawkes, exuding a piercing layer of panache against a formidable McDormand). Scourged by guilt, anguish and grievance, Ms. McDormand reincarnates herself with a tour-de-force seethed with belligerence and compassion, and these two facets' dichotomous incongruence is ambidextrously sublimed into a completely believable persona, a woman who is troublingly reckless, deeply mired in her personal crisis, yet, spurns any throwaway commiserations and homily with razor-sharp astuteness and holds onto the flickering hope of justice in a heartbroken hankering. Oscar No. 2 beckons for this hard-nosed leading lady, a no-bullshitting force of character that quite swims with the topical tide of women's ME TOO movement. Jason's plot is in no way less salient than Mildred (I will defend that he is a co-leading role up to my deathbed), but this less pathbreaking male-white-trash-goes-good thread feels self-pleasing in the milieu albeit Rockwell nails the character to the hilt with his indissoluble commitment, Jason's transmogrification is thematically satisfactory (although his closeted homosexuality doesn't get a bigger canvas to play betrays the film's conservative-pampering disposition, a wasted opportunity for the up-and-coming Caleb Landry Jones as the unbelievably congenial Red Welby, the manager in the advertise company who is unwarrantedly subjected to Jason's heinous physical abuse, the latter's underlying sexual frustration is left only faintly hinted), it almost renders its contrived sensation (Jason obliviously reading the letter when Mildred tossing Molotov cocktails to the police station where he is) extraneous, because we need someone to track down the killer so badly. Therefore, in the end of the day, it is Martin McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling that becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers (this reviewer included), his script flouts conventionalism (yes, pesky kids do need a good kicking!), larded with eccentricity and humor, often when one is least expected (Charlie's 19-year-old new girlfriend Penelope is a hoot, of course, in second-guessing, it is a common tack to find excuse for men in those May-December pairings), and tones down violence but ups his antes in laying bare the complex tie-ins throbbing under the bracket of humanity and morality, warts and all. The truly astonishing but also whip-smart ploy is the open-ended coda, just when we think a climax is in the offing, the film brings down its curtain roundly, what else can top that? As either outcome of Mildred and Jason's vigilante act will look less impactful in the aftermath, a substantial closure may or may not attainable, life can be as misty as the film's opening shots, the cardinal message is that both have found the right path to move on, one has to hand it to Martin McDonagh for its resultant brimming gratification left in its spectator's mind.",8,3,5,24 February 2018
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim
","Del Toro's latest tentpole, watched in 3D format on IMAX screen, a substantial SFX Jarger Vs. Kaiju monolith which makes TRANSFORMER franchise pale in comparison. But the feeble storyline and unimaginative character-building drags the film into a scrape of torpor. especially after the seasonal actioners' drumfire (after WHITE HOUSE DOWN 2013, 6/10 and FAST AND FURIOUS 6 2013. 6/10), PACIFIC RIM is the most costly one, and its red-hot accomplishment in the Chinese box office suggests a belated chance to break even its tepid reception in the North American domain, with its Japan opening this coming weekend, an approximate $400,000,000 worldwide turnover may green-light a sequel for its ardent followers. The 3D effect surely doesn't improve at all thanks to the murky palette of the raining night combat and underwater location, under the 3D monopoly (even more absurd there are 4D version available in theaters) at least in China, we have no access to the plain 2D type, which rumor says its rendition is much better in an IMAX screen. Dedicated to Japanese Tokusatsu films, Del Toro and his crew's reconstruction and invention of genre is groundbreaking, an eye- opener with excellent technical scrupulousness, the bombarding sound effects are overwhelming as well as its awe-inspiring and heroic battle scenes. There are some hiccups keep bugging me, an obvious one is that why on earth there is no conventional weaponry assistance engaging in the doomsday battle, not even as the cannon fodder; another one is the last moment sword stunt, saving the best for the last may not work here, it is only for practicability, but an ill-considered one. Hunnam doesn't possess enough charisma to carry on the film on his shoulder and his platonic relation with Kikuchi hasn't been dug deep enough to steal the limelight. Other actors are standard equipments, Elba is the commander whose background story desperately needs a prequel. Day is the comic relief and Perlman is the egomaniac laughing-stock. Del Toro's Hollywood odyssey has been rougher than one had presumed, PACIFIC RIM is a qualified film in the sense of it is an updated product for the genre criterion (let's wait and see how GODZILLA will handle the challenge next year), but it doesn't live up to Del Toro's talent if one familiars with his earlier films, notably his homespun masterpiece PAN'S LABYRINTH (2006, 9/10), where mythology and reality have been miraculously criss-crossed and not only our eyes are being opened, our hearts are also being filled with passion and vibration.",6,3,6,7 August 2013
American Sniper," it is a shade pathetic the sensation falls upon this ill-devised picture
","Amid its unanticipated parade into this year's Oscar race (6 nominations including BEST PICTURE and BEST LEADING ACTOR) as an extremely late contender, and more astonishingly, its domestic box-office outburst since last week, Mr. Eastwood's biography of Chris Kyle, the most prolific Navy SEAL sniper, arrives to the fore in Egypt. The film stirs a massive controversy in the states albeit it has achieved a career peak for the octogenarian film legend, as there is a pungent odor of jingoism permeating the narrative, particularly centers on its defamatory depiction of Muslin race in the Iraqi war zone, what is exacerbating is that under the current international circumstances, it doesn't help to dissipate the acute prejudice in the stateside, pitifully, Eastwood could not been more open-minded in his well-executed anti-war drama. Conspicuously, this film is relentlessly sending an ant-war message from A to Z, but it could be shallowly misread as a bias propaganda simply because the whole perspective is from the slant of Americans, how perilous the front-line is, how the inner struggle comes to pester his conscience when Kyle (Cooper) is facing menaces from suicidal children and women, how devastating when the casualty befalls on your teammate, etc, while mistreating the middle east counterpart as canon fodder or barbarous murders (even towards their own kind). Back to home, Kyle (Cooper)'s PTSD symptoms are zoomed in on empathetically, from his withdrawn numbness stiffly obstructing a normal communication with his wife Taya (Miller), to his fitful violent behavior due to his hallucination or an aggressive paranoid towards the quotidian life, Kyle's hero-status is not a desirable one, when praised by a young veteran (a delightful cameo from Jonathan Groff), whose life he once saved, Kyle's robotic reaction potently suggests that it means nothing to him, even though he proudly proclaims that saving lives is the noble cause for his actions. Indeed, if one can discard the miasma of racial disrespect (frankly speaking, a very difficult task to pull off), Eastwood has made quite an engaging film to behold, the incontrovertible grip to his brainchild can be traced seamlessly through the horizon-widening hovering shots by DP Tom Stern, the stifling sound department throughout the taut action sequences, the life-or-death suspense within one trigger by its swift editing and an end-game retreat in a lifelike sand storm. Bradley Cooper gives a formidable performance here, a sea change in his physique is too evident to ignore, but Kyle's elusive persona doesn't proffer too much Oscar-worthy moments for his, we can only assume that Academy is still in the honeymoon period with him, three nominations in a row is an overachiever (especially considering the √ºber- competitive candidates this year) which seems to boomerang within certain time (as the case for my ginger goddess Amy Adams). Sienna Miller, whose career has been in the stagnant water for years, certainly receives a stimulating boost this year, after a small part in another Oscar-hopeful FOXCATCHER (2014), her role as a supportive wife pans out convincingly without any bells and whistles to enliven Taya to be a character with any noteworthy novelty, only to testify she has honed up her acting chops and can shoulder on some more challenging projects now.American SNIPER cannot evade to be compared with Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER (2008, 8/10), which is far more humane and non judgmental in its integrity. Theoretically it could have been a top dog in its game, but Eastwood's right-wing stand does taint its wholesome awesomeness, however as far as profit is concerned, we onlookers should not bark at the moon, it certainly eclipses everybody's expectations, there is no losers in this round, notwithstanding that it is a shade pathetic the sensation falls upon this ill-devised picture.",7,2,13,25 January 2015
Lion," a populist crowd-pleaser, but definitely not 'one of the year's best'
","A heartening and incredible true story about an Indian man Saroo, in 1986, at the age of 5 (Pawar), he inadvertently hopped on an empty train in the night which later streaked for 3 days to Calcutta, thousands miles away from where he comes from. Failed to express the right name of his hometown, Saroo strays on the street, and had narrow escapes from human traffickers and unscrupulous people with an insidious agenda. Eventually he is put into a cramped orphanage and the next year, he would adopted by an Australian couple Sue (Kidman) and John (Wenham) living in the ethereal Tasmania island. This is the first half of LION, a feature debut from Australian filmmaker Garth Davis, which has charmed with six Oscar nominations including BEST PICTURE.The second half, jumps bluntly to 20 years later, Saroo (played by a unkempt and burly Patel), battles the flitting fragments of his vague past, decides to dredge up his memory lane and look for his family in India, thanks to Google Earth (a miracle actually actualized by the advancement of digital era), he fortuitously retread his voyage back to the starting point, and a final reunion comes 25 years after, some are still there waiting for him and some has been long gone. That is a tearjerker in full swing, yet, this reviewer is dry-eyed. How come?Sunny Pawar, a boy wonder in his first film role, carries on the first half with astounding mettle and age-defying gravitas, glints with street-smart when he sniffs something iffy, and runs like (literally) his life depends on it, Saroo's urchin days are so perilous, but what emits from his expressive eyes is the undimmed conviction of going back home. Although, accountably, it seems that in order to adhere to Saroo's memoir, the film stays firmly from Saroo's 5-year-older angle, which leaves certain lacunae in the process, a glaring one is why Saroo has the potluck to be chosen out of others in the same plight, which could have been tapped into since that is the more pressing issue viewers are interested in. Unfortunately, the film takes a downward spiral when Saroo's journey abruptly relayed to adulthood, don't get me wrong, Dev Patel has done an amazing job to keep Saroo's emotional outpourings simmering and unfolding, but the vigor and rhythm percolating the first half start to fizzle out (even the camera lumbers against a drabber palette), when danger and hunger is superseded by civilization and comfort. So as if to create a narrative momentum of conflict, Lucy (Mara), Saroo's girlfriend appears timely to be the devil's advocate in a pretty lame way, not just because there is absolutely nothing contentious for a man setting up his mind to look for his lost family if he can find some clue, what else can his girlfriend to do apart from supporting his decision? But also, their romantic involvement is so tenuously orchestrated, chemistry is awkwardly wanting, might just as well being wholly jettisoned. The inaction of the second part drags too long because there are name stars in it, Nicole Kidman de-glamorizes herself in an affecting transmutation into a caring mother with a philanthropic devotion, notwithstanding, padding it out is a default manoeuvre, but there are missed opportunities, for instance, Mantosh (Ladwa), Saroo's damaged adopted brother, whose own unrevealed tale of woe would have been better mined to give the second half a thrust. As a populist crowd-pleaser, LION - its title refers to Saroo's mispronounced real name Sheru, which means lion in Hindi, is a bespoke Oscar-player in its build-in configuration, but a lesser succ√®s d'estime to be fairly entitled as 'one of the year's best', even by the Hollywood yardstick.",7,7,12,7 April 2017
The Lost City of Z," certainly a rewarding viewing experience
","An epic biography of British explorer Percy Fawcett, at first glance, doesn't seem to be in the American filmmaker James Gray's elements, his fifth feature film is also his first venture into a period setting, traversing two continents and spanning two decades (from 1905 to 1925), as our current fatigue towards the obsequiously awards-coveting biopic genre still persists, could Mr. Gray's offering dissipate the lethargy of blas√© and inscribe his own footprint in the rut? The answers are no and yes. The blas√© timber lies in the material itself, it is after all, a heroic story (tinged with a pinch of mythos) begging for adulation, and Gray chooses to recount Percy's (Hunnam) extraordinary life in a faithfully chronological order and establishes him as an every-man but bristling with vim and vigor, thus we could safely rule out the imperious internecine conflicts √† la Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's two expedition pieces, during his perilous adventures among the tropical jungles and waterways. The character development is formulaic and painstakingly eschews a larger-than-life approach, for example, a full-bearded Robert Pattinson downplays Percy's fellow explorer Henry Costin, shadowing his footsteps but is left with no florid delivery to chew on, neither does Hunnam's taciturn hero, but perversely, that is where Gray makes his mark.The film is anything but a hagiography, which entails that Gray's script gives the room to let his characters live and breathe as authentic as possible, emotions are measured, feelings are understated, words are superfluous (except for the sporadic wrangles and squabbles, whether they are marital, familial or academic, Angus Macfadyen palpably plays an exasperating benefactor who is not prepared for the expedition and comes off as a petty denigrator), but the awe towards an unfamiliar culture is immeasurable (however primordial and savage it transpires), so what we are privileged to watch is a series of minutely orchestrated fluxes of Percy's life: the first two botched voyages, his WWI stint, the calm days after and his last outing with his eldest son Jack (Holland) to look for a closure towards his life-long pursuit, all is rendered with ineffable beauty through the craft of its art production and Darius Khondji's stunning camera-work, which doesn't operate the usual method of sweeping aerial shots foregrounding the Amazonian locale, but takes a closer inspection of the mysterious lushness buzzed with vitality and danger, simultaneously. The nocturnal ritual sequences during the climax are transcendent, when our protagonists are carried off-screen to their ambiguous destiny, what we see is the misty, ethereal environs, shimmering with a dark-blue sheen, that is a reverent homage to the unknown and the divine. So is the final shots, focusing on Nina (Miller), Percy's forbearing wife, whatever has happened, happened, it is what her husband and son want, she has to come to terms with that. So a gorgeous finishing touch shows Nina seemingly wend her way into a tropical forest, to unfold that hopes are never dashed, even it is solely for her sake, a reunion (or reconciliation) is powerfully but quietly sublimated, however ambivalent it looks.Hunnam exudes a more internal aspect of his acting range through his deeply immersed effort, his version of Percy is a hyperbole-free doer, a trailblazer, a leader; whereas Miller, ostensibly is saddled with a traditional wife role, who is platitudinously burdened with child-bearing and an often absent husband, but doesn't sit contently in the back seat, Gray's sensible script commendably amps up her narrative arc, and Miller shines beautifully when being granted a chance to express her feelings and views, counterpointing the milieu's conservative reality. Perhaps out of the respect of his subject, James Gray doesn't deign to buoy up the narrative with cinematic gimmicks or unwarranted action enhancers, thus the final outcome is an attentive, albeit conventional adaptation of a real-life adventurer combating his way through the untrod-den path, it takes some patience to dawdle through its longueur but ultimately it is certainly a rewarding viewing experience.",8,2,6,4 May 2017
Ant-Man," ANT-MAN should be a staple of the Avengers ensemble and function far more critical than a comic relief
","A 3D cinema-going of Marvel's latest offering ANT-MAN, which has always been in the pickle during its journey to the big screen, originally it had been a brainchild of Edgar Wright for years, then he dropped out in the relatively late development due to creative disagreement, and Peyton Reed takes over the director chair. While Wright has a die-hard fanbase and a distinct visual style (although his geeky smartness sometimes can go overboard, like SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD 2010), Reed can no more than be extolled as a slick journeyman in cranking up comedies like YES MAN (2008, 6/10), THE BREAK-UP (2006, 6/10), DOWN WITH LOVE (2003, 5/10) and BRING IT ON (2000), so fans should automatically lower their expectation. However, the final product transpires to be pretty diverting and humorous (certainly this should thanks to Wright's original script, which is kept in the movie to some degree), it can expediently reach the upper tier of Marvel's cinematic universe. Deadpan comedian Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a nimble-fingered thief with principles, a divorced middle-age father who always want to prove himself as a hero to his daughter, is selected to be the (second) Ant-man by Dr. Hank Pam (Douglas), who designs a special suit years ago, which can make the wearer shrink to the size of an ant, and indeed he is the first Ant-man. Together with the assistance of Hank's daughter Hope van Dyne (Lilly), Scott needs to learn how to mind- control his own ant army and gets acquaint with his new superpower, since the villain Darren Cross (Stoll), once Dr. Hank's prot√©g√©, who later ousted Hank from the company he established, also has managed to design a Yellowjacket suit can do the same, and decides to sell to the evil HYDRA organisation, Scott must stop him. One plugging of the film is of course the size of Ant-man, indeed, the visual tactic is vastly refreshing when Ant-man shrinks to the size of an ant and the concurrent magnifying of our familiar world into giant environment, it situates us for the first time, observes the world from an insect's point-of-view, especially in the tub scene, when Scott experiences his transformation for the first time; also critically, what Ant-man has to deal with is not all the blasting and levelling bombardment which THE AVENGERS and other superhero franchises have bitten off more than we can chew, the scale of demolition is being crackly utilised, markedly in the big combat scene, it never get out of the bedroom of Scott's daughter Cassie (Fortson), which can at least appease the picture's second-rate arrangement of a super-villain and his rashly concocted ulterior motive, as well as the frustrating standard family fare after Scott shrinks to subatomic size and then cornily returns to the macroscopic world with her daughter as the emotional anchor. The innovative visual gag aside, one promising winning part is its cast, Rudd has his natural charisma as an ordinary good-looking guy, laid-back and a real hoot, he and Chris Pratt are two new additions in the Marvel universe, and their comedic affinity does dissipate the fatigue of more straight-faced action hero's self-seriousness. Douglas emanates a sympathetic father-daughter bond with Lilly, which coherently corresponds with Scott and Cassie's rapport, and is fairly at ease in his mentor image. But, the real scene stealer is Pe√±a as Luis, Scott's best buddy, his two tip-montage parts are scintilla-tingly hilarious, and Pe√±a is such a gifted actor in comedic timing, and he can even upgrade not-so-funny lines to be a total riot, really impressive and surprisingly excellent! One thing for sure, the pattern of the first chapter of a superhero-is-born is alway the same platitude, how he acquires the unique power, how to adopt to his superpower and his new identity, and finally how to finish off a villain, but, ANT-MAN provides a fresh angle/scale to widen our imagination, the knowing references to join the Avengers is his next move, and reckoning the prospect, ANT-MAN can be a staple of the ensemble and function far more critical than a comic relief, let's wait and see.",7,0,8,2 August 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," On a par with its sturdy sequel
","Incited by its super polished CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10), I feel impulsive to watch its prequel, which eluded me when it came out in 2011 chiefly thanks to the irreparable damage caused by Evan's lame Human Torch act in the awful FANTASTIC 4 duds, and his breakthrough role in the murderously awful comedy NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE (2001, 3/10), I just thought he was not bright enough to be interesting as a national hero, however, both the second Captain American venture and SNOWPIERCER (2013, 7/10) have regained my faith in him, and finally I watched the film.Being mostly sceptic about Marvel's comic exploitation, I find this film makes a smart decision to get away from the ultra-modern havoc-wrecked cityscape, and locates the story in the WWII with an enticing retro flair around it, it instantly emanates a more reality-approaching understanding of the milieu, and the magical CGI achievement of a puny 90 pounds Steve Rogers also lights up one's intrigue, smoothly propels the plot unwind in the anticipated direction where he is transformed into a super soldier. Stanley Tucci leaves a strong impression as Dr. Abraham Erskine, whose keen attention makes cherry-picking Steve as the guinea pig much more plausible than we could guess.Hayley Atwell, as Agent Carter, not a red-lip pin-up girl for soldiers fantasy only, proves that in Marvel's realm, real girls are never guy-shy, the romance between Steve and her plays out disarmingly with a crescendo in the near-end, a date he is destined to miss; Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, as grumpy as usual, but the banter amid the crucial chasing sequences means he is not a stiff militant officer as he appears, and his a sterling driver too; The seed of the bromance between Captain and his best-buddy Bucky Barnes (Stan) is sown pretty palpably as well, and their all-race-included squad could not be more politically safe for the alliance. Hugo Weaving is the Nazi officer Johann Schmidt aka. Red Skull, the head of HYDRA, who blatantly discards his human skin for the second half of the movie, falls short as a qualified super-villain, basically the only countermeasure of Captain America's front-door attack is to retreat with his treasured tesseract, his ruthlessness and supernormal toughness never take off too far.Most of the time, the film looks like a vintage war movie than a Superhero production, and Captain American is a down-to-earth paragon with all the virtues needed for an orthodox representation, Evans steadily sheds his frivolousness and shoulders on the most legitimate American hero to be a prominent part in The Avengers assembly. Finally, the time-jumping finale, it is a bit rushed, no details of the 70-years cryogenic nap is materialized on the screen, how he survived the crush, and how he was discovered and reserved, all omitted; the bug of the radio is also very amateur. By comparison, the action part is not as thrilling as its sequel, and director Joe Johnston (THE WOLFMAN 2010, JURASSIC PARK III 2001, 4/10) may never be an innovative creator, but certainly he is a hard worker who is able to streamline the patchwork and as far as this movie is concerned, it is not bad at all.",7,0,0,14 July 2014
American Hustle," a qualified David O'Russell fare
","American HUSTLE has an impeachable cast, a 70s zeitgeist ambiance (sterling soundtrack, hairstyling and wardrobe selections), a not-so-bulletproof script, but the film is nonetheless a hail of David O'Russell's consistency in his endeavour of characters-centred dramedy, he relentlessly supplies improvisations for his actors to illicit their spontaneous interactions with maximum dynamism, meanwhile his slick camera mobility complements the narrative steadily with intentional oomph to woo the audience, a strategy functions unexpectedly well after the one-two punch THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10) and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012, 7/10), now American HUSTLE repeats the mojo, altogether ricochet him to the rarefied echelon of a three- times BEST DIRECTOR nominees, and an auteur status rosily awaits. It is a con men's tale superimposed on some real events, don't wait for a revelational twist in the end, it is a flat-out chicanery hatched by pro con artist Irving (Bale) and his business partner/inamorata Sydney (Adams) dragooned by a hotheaded FBI agent Richie (Cooper), a bold plan to snare politicians to bribery through a forged Arabic sheikh who promises to invest the Atlantic City while also incriminates an intimidating mafia boss (a surprising cameo here), things may run a little off-track thanks to Irving's big-mouthed bimbo wife Rosalyn (Lawrence), but in any rate they pull off the scam and to all appearances the only collateral damage is the aspiring Mayor Carmine Polito (Renner). The storyline goes high-flown all over the place, from the telling voice-over of Irving and Sydney narrating their lot to the summary engineering of the swindle, and a highly-anticipated showdown between the wife and the other woman, O'Russell never get cold-feet in pitching viewers against the heightened melodrama, plus he is also a cunning gamer of deploying ticking bombs but never ignite them, the set pieces of giving the game away (language is always a ruthless traitor) are elaborately engaging, anyhow even in the worst-case scenario, its wacky caricature can deaden the threats and we are riding on the devil-may-care road again. A consecutive home-run for 4 nominations in all acting category after SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a marvellous feat, Christian Bale is a fervid shapeshifter, downplays Irving's cautiousness and shrewdness in the teamwork while highlights his fatal weak point, that is he is incapable of controlling his women, both Sydney and Rosalyn, his oscillation is palpable although we may feel in deficiency of sympathy for him. As much as I adore Amy Adams, her role is not entirely within Oscar-calibre, she confidently carries her story halfway through, then gives way to be a sidekick, even during the confrontation between her and Rosalyn, which should be her moment, she is eclipsed by the more coruscating Jennifer Lawrence, who is getting more and more accustomed to act over her real age, which is always appreciable and more approachable to its core audience. Cooper, a scene-stealer especially when he co-exists with a more reserved Bale, spontaneously hilarious especially when he confronts his boss (Louis C.K.) the (never-ending) fishing joke, the assault and mimic scenes are killingly comical. Renner is the unsung hero here, there is something ambiguous under his ideal husband/politician archetype and he is the one embellishes his character with a patina of the unpredictability of human nature. The film is all about disguise, Irving preens his bald dome with a toupee, Sydney's fake British identity, Richie's curly hair, and who knows what is Carmine's non-shown self, the facade is a prerequisite to their self-esteem, Rosalyn maybe both the dumbest and the wisest of them all, she gets what she wants in the end and her conception of the nail polish with a scent of putridity is spot-on. The best line of the film? My pick is 'it is almost scary, how easy it is to take money from desperate people'. A rude-awakening and a truism hard to swallow.",8,0,2,30 March 2014
Nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal-aissance is officially on fire now
","A cinema-going to continually witness Jake Gyllenhaal's unstoppable resurgence to be the most versatile and ardent actor among his peers. After last year's one-two punch PRISONERS (2013, 8/10) and ENMEY (2013, 8/10), NIGHTCRAWLER is screenwriter Dan Gilroy's director debut, set in L.A., the title refers to hired hands who usually drift at night, as soon as any accident or crime happens, they will rush to the scene and take lurid photos and videos, then sell them to the local media for highest bid. Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is one of them, he is so good at it and professes that he is born to do this job, what's more chilling is that he is a callous sociopath with no moral boundary, even more shockingly is the society not only condones him, but encourages and rewards him bountifully. Gyllenhaal physically morphs into a slightly-built figure with his back a shade contorted, the weight-lost stunt now has become quite a norm in the industry (works wonderful for McConaussaince and Jared Leto in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10), and here it injects an ineffaceable first impression of Louis' character, makes his extra-widely-open eyes purposefully dominant, firstly one cannot help rooting for him because of his underdog confidence, for his ambition and obsession is so scorchingly determined, the performance is nothing but Oscar-worthy, Gyllenhaal stuns as one of the most dangerous and compelling sociopath ever on the screen, noticeably his barely-blinking bluntness, if one can recall his eccentric blinking in PRISONERS, you will realize how phenomenal he is, the devil is all in the details. Louis is not a guy deserves admiration, he is covetous, crafty, glib-tongued with mechanical oration, intriguingly he is also rather candid, both with his guileless assistant Rick (Ahmed) and with the Nina (Russo), the producer of the local TV news program, who stands for the usual haughty stereotype of media personage with a sole rate-seeking guideline. Russo shoulders on an intensely passive aggressive verbal battle with Gyllenhaal, and the mutual influences are being put under the magnifying glass with pungent smell, which will effectively give us some introspection to chew on afterward. In a modern capitalistic society, how far we have been gone? Dehumanising individuals in order to pursue success, this is the underbelly of humanity which Gilroy is gutsy enough to uncover, equally praiseworthy is Ahmed, he represents a realistic take on how crazy things are and his upshot is the harshest indictment of the encroaching injustice. The film mainly happens in the nighttime, Oscar-winner DP Robert Elswit (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007 9/10) capture the nocturnal seediness in a subdued tinge, evokes an uncanny tension whenever Louis is on the move, exploits the found-footage gambit to state a point. Also the car-chasing piece near the end is a masterful endeavor, on the whole the entire film is utterly gripping like an urban tale itself, though he might miss an Oscar nomination due to fierce competition and the dark subject matter, but for sure Gyllenhaal-aissance is officially on fire now! Next stop is Antoine Fuqua's boxer-drama SOUTHPAW, it will not just be another impressive physique sea change on the horizon.",8,0,1,8 December 2014
Baby Driver," one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back
","Officially becoming cinematic scenester Edgar Wright's highest grossing film to date and breaks into the 9-digit club in its North American territory, BABY DRIVER, his sixth feature, ebulliently welds his music-savvy retro-flair into an uber-stylized heist drama, and its riveting opening gambit of an adrenaline-rushing car-chasing sequence trenchantly assuages our dread concerning the wind-up of our baby-faced protagonist, as long as he is behind the wheel, he is invincible, and the situation only becomes parlous when he isn't. Baby (Elgort) is a music-loving getaway driver in Atlanta, Georgia, tinnitus-inflicted by a childhood car accident (which rendered him parent-less), he is reticent and steeped in the music to fend off his ailment, especially in the heat of his dangerous metier, music is essential in adjusting his judgment and performing those incredible car stunts. He never fails and becomes the mascot of the criminal mastermind Doc (a stern but wise-cracking Spacey), who promises that Baby can go straight when their debt is squared up, and for one blithe moment, that actually happens, where Baby finds a less risky pizza-delivery job and strikes up a heartfelt romance with waitress Debora (Lily James, personable as ever), until Doc railroads him into taking another job, teaming up with three other criminals, the seemingly congenial but relentlessly lethal Buddy (Hamm, devilishly handsome and irrationally elicits one's trepidation of his denouement), his bombshell wife Darling (Gonz√°lez) and a trigger-happy motor mouth Bats (a marginally irksome Jamie Foxx), and their plan to rob a post office goes askew even before it starts. The rest of the story slumps into clich√©: conscience mounting, body-count soaring, danger menacing, and also a lesson to those evil bosses who relent in the last minute, don't! Baby must save himself from the resultant m√™l√©e and also secure the safety of Debora and his deaf foster father (CJ Jones), with a single-minded villain on his tail who, albeit his unswerving resolution of vengeance, more often than not, opts for talking over pulling the trigger when he gains the upper hand in the cat-and-mouse game, to further aggravate the time-honored chagrin of most filmic villains. Apart from Wright's bountiful aural potpourri (the film's soundtrack is the bee's knees), crafty action pieces, sleek camera antics and outlandish humor (the mix-tape placement is a gas with the great pull of Baby's emotional state). What makes viewers tick is Ansel Elgort's amiable leading performance, Baby is a wizard in the driving seat, but exceptionally denuded of conceit (a staple streak in Wright's characters, although Spacey, Foxx and Hamm are all competing for that grail), conversely, Elgort is radiant of his youthful nonchalance, visceral tenderness and a personal panache transcending the common teen heartthrob crush, which fits him as a Hollywood's rising star and a future mainstay. So, the jury is in, might not be as lenient as those in the film, but BABY DRIVER is a bonafide asset to dissipate the summer blockbuster lethargy and one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back!",7,3,6,14 August 2017
Justice League," not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone
","Riding on the coattail of WONDER WOMAN's stirring triumph, Zac Snyder's JUSTICE LEAGUE is emulating DC's THE AVENGERS (2012), only 5-year has become such an oceanic gap in our time of superhero surpluses, which means financial turnover would be a letdown in spite of its immense appeal. The elephant-in-the-room and main selling point is the resurrection of Superman (Cavill), an open secret the film intractably refuses to divulge in its numerous trailers and posters, which comes about in the mid-point and temporarily instigates a mini-internecine scuffle, just to show who is the boss, before getting lovey-dovey and melancholic with Lois Lane (Adams), who is too poised to give away even a smidgen of incredulity (which says a lot about the comic book culture itself). As the inauguratory piece, JUSTICE LEAGUE's chief task is to assemble the cohort, thus the premise is set up by the resurgence of Steppenwolf (CGI-generated and voiced by Hinds), to reign the universe in darkness, the film's strongest visual input is surprisingly in the the first half, when Steppenwolf tentatively assaults the empyrean Themyscira (Amazons' homeland) and underwater Atlantis to snatch the almighty 'mother boxes', and the fleeting flashback of how Steppenwolf is subdued for the first time, it has an epic whiff of panache and otherness, which diminishes when the war relocates on human's turf (a remote Russian village is circumspectly chosen for the climax after learning the lesson from the aftermath of laying waste to a highly-populated metropolis), with a bathetic revelation that perhaps, Steppenwolf's power is vastly overestimated, because he is categorically no rival of Superman, the quintet might just as well finish him off sans the film's obvious deus ex-machina. It is expected to pull punches in the league's first official sortie, but by enervating the villain who is introduced as an omnipotent monster in the beginning is a lame move (THOR: RAGNAROK on the contrary, fabricates a more plausible finale). For all the quibbles, there are several plus points too, firstly, it is a sage move to accentuate Batman's mortality, which begins to tell when fighting side by side with those superpower endowed, and he is considerably relegated to combat with the minions called Parademons in the showdown, a cross to bear for a mortal, and let's hope Bruce Wayne will take the hint and step down from the front-line in the next chapter, not because an elderly Alfred (Irons) does need a replacement to stay in front of all the consoles and screens, but also due to the fact that Diane Prince (Gadot) is ready to take the rein as a true leader for all mankind, it is time, right? Secondly, in a less solemn note, Ezra Miller's Flash jovially assumes the role as the comic purveyor because humor is what is wanting in DC's previous critically-panned tent-poles, because the delicate balance between levity and gravity is always the sticking point which does make a difference in audience's reception and the film's own worth. All in all, JUSTICE LEAGUE is not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone to tantalize us that the next offering will be more toothsome, more grand and more arousing, but patience is dangerously wearing thin and interest will dry out someday, speaking for the reviewer himself, that day is beckoning.",6,14,22,19 November 2017
Man of Steel," Man of Steel
","My most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2013, from the mastermind of 300 (2006, 7/10) and WATCHMEN (2009, 7/10), the reboot of the most popular superhero has undergone a series of choppy fluctuations since the under-performance of Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006, 7/10), so an IMAX plus 3D version for me is a prerequisite to watch. Not an avid fan of Snyder, but MAN OF STEEL is an up-to-par epic bandwagon superbly grafts the invincible Kryptonian alien under the context of a xenophobic earth milieu, a human environment-nurtured extraterrestrial identity chooses to combat against his own race to save the cynical earthlings. The film majestically branches out a unique palette of indigo and gray, a post-apocalypse solemness which is unlike most of its superfluous comic-derived peers (producer Christopher Nolan's sway may be a plausible influence), and a hefty impetus of Clark Kent's poignant relation with his human parents perpetually spurs the film to imprint its most eloquent fingerprints onto the heart of its recipients, a far better fulfillment than the parentless spidey (both Costner and Lane are heartwarming and sagacious in it). Crowe and Zurer as Superman's biological parents, both are throwaway in the overture of Krypton's demise, the former then resurrects himself as a bewildering wraith inside the flying vehicle, sabotages General Zod's scheme. Against the ageism, Adams offers brilliant ballast as the mettlesome journalist Lois Lane, a paragon of the benevolence from human part, the mutual attraction between her and Kent is ignited, but markedly Snyder saves the best for the sequel. Antje Traue and Christopher Meloni, one is the ferocious sidekick of Zod, another is a human general fights till his self-sacrifice heroic act, brings out an intensive beast-and-prey pattern of diversion which is a rare treat for side players in mainstream cinema. Michael Shannon as General Zod, a bona-fide super-villain counteracts Superman's almighty indestructibility, his human-eradication theory surpasses any comic fecklessness, and the gravity-reconstruction concept really put the entire planet hanging on a thread (I always redeem a sudden depletion of gravity is the way to our doomsday), Shannon is incredible to magnify his militant loyalty and the genocide-prone mercilessness whilst viewers would eventually be touched by the former, such a transcending feat to accomplish out of a fixated mold. Same can be stated to Henry Cavill's Superman, he is a flawless messiah of our planet, and Cavill is the perfect Superman, both from his physique and his charisma (and finally the underwear goes underneath his uniform), his oscillation has never been shied away in the film, and it makes the final neck-breaking such an emotional disturbance both to him and to the viewers. The CGI effects are another fusillade of leveling cities and blasting buildings after THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), but an amazing stunt is this time it ad hoc showcases an uplifting process of Superman's sway of his flying expertise. A recurrent blip of the genre is the willful negligence of the aftershock, 5 seconds later, everyone act like they are totally oblivious of the apocalyptic attack no matter how damaged the city is, the transference is unnaturally nettling, the least one can do is to take a few shots of people's contemplation as survivors of such a catastrophe, or raise hope to shoot scenes of the restoration and a panorama of the mess is a must to deepen the seriousness of the matter. Anyhow, MAN OF STEEL is a stylized orthodox superhero film which successfully recoups the fan-boys and bolsters a stronghold for the series in its lucrative future projects, its mass appeal might lag behind Marvel's SHIELDS coalition, but Superman's adventure will be more audacious and reflective other than its entertaining face value.",8,1,5,7 July 2013
The Thing," a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come
","Turning Antarctica into fire and brimstone, John Carpenter's analog-era paranoia horror classic THE THING boosts a smorgasbord of eye-popping special make-up effects predominantly fashioned by a 21-year-old Rob Bottin, these human-things, dog-things, assimilated by an unknown, amorphous alien life form, aka, the thing, are gooey, gross-out but also drolly camp without a sinister layer of menace, the truth is, once the thing reveals its true color out of its host's body, most of the time, it is too maladroit to escape from being incinerated by flamethrowers, so the imperative for it is to hide in plain sight among its human hosts, a group of a dozen (male exclusive) American researchers stationed in their secluded antarctic base, and waits for rescue team to make it pandemic. Once audience inures to its animatronic gimmicks, the movie's scary quotient begins to lessen (save for Morricone's minimal, ominous score) and what Carpenter plays up is the burgeoning distrust among those Yankees under the bleak, claustrophobic circumstances, yet, character-molding is not right up his alley (Ridley Scott's ALIEN 1979 is a far superior antecedent), ergo THE THING is considerably deficient in ammunition of imploding conflict and treachery, and high on explosive ruckus after survivors are routinely rubbed out by ringing the changes of optical spectacles, no one is safe apart from the top billed Kurt Russell, as the helicopter pilot MacReady, who is granted with a protagonist's halo and inexplicably brainy enough to float the idea of testing remaining crew's blood to identify who has been infected, on account of the thing's innate survival instinct. However, there is a loose end in the extrapolation that MacReady has been assimilated on the ground of his torn clothes, which goes unsolved. THE THING is Carpenter's foray into studio filmmaking and it relishes in its dazzling production value, its refrigerated setting in L.A. is a huge project and the matte painting of the place where the alien life first crashed on earth significantly enhances its filmic quality, although ineluctably, an analog proto-computer is a dead giveaway of its time and superficially deployed in spoon-feeding us with information such as how fast an apocalypse is at stake if the thing gets out of the station alive. Lastly, Carpenter discloses his ace in the hole in the end, when two survivors seem to calmly wait for their slow death from cold in the now blown-up site, an ambiguous gesture may or may not intimate that one of them is infected by the thing, which beckons various theories from cult followers after its initial tepid reception, in hindsight, THE THING, a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come, is arguably Carpenter's best.",7,2,3,25 February 2018
The Revenant," Ecstatic beauty of a linear survival tale
","Of course we can tease that DiCaprio has turned Inarritu's latest majestically-looking Western revenge saga as his almost-perfect Oscar-draw with all the exacting physical tribulations: severely mauled by a bear, being buried alive, worming his way in the wild, floating on the raging torrent, eating raw fish and bison liver, falling from a cliff and keeping warm inside a dead horse's cavity, etc. etc. some of those are real deal, others are cinematic creation, but there is no shame for an actor challenges himself to the extreme in order to win an Oscar award, although to many a cinephile, most of time Oscar looks like a joke, but for those whose career is making movies, getting the recognition from their peers is a huge honour and temptation rather difficult to refuse, also at least Leo does all those impressive stunts in his film instead of in the tiresome self- campaign.Last year's Oscar winner Inarritu returns with an even more grandstanding showpiece, running over 2 and a half hours, the narrative is fairly simple, inspired by a true event, in 1820s, a member of a fur trading expedition, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), survives a deadly bear attack and embarks on an astounding journey to avenge the killer of his Pawnee son Hawk (Goodluck). Basically, it is an eye- opening survival tale plus an old-fashion Western ending, but under Inarritu's perfectionist and harsh working ethos, DP Emmanuel Lubezki's mind-blowing visual grandeur (I'm talking about THE TREE OF LIFE level of magnificence, even the sky is not the limit for this guy!) and a fearless cast headed by DiCaprio and Hardy, we are awed to witness Hugh's entire ordeal with admiration and inconceivability. One sure thing, apart from Leo's Oscar chance, is Lubezki is on the fast track to fulfil his hat trick after GRAVITY (2013) and BIRDMAN (2014), one can only feel particularly sorry for Roger Deakins, who might lose to the same guy three times (consecutively) after his 13th nomination for SICARIO (2015) and still be Oscar-less.Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this year finally belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio, personally I am not a fan of bodily transformation or endeavour, because the highest achievement of acting is reflected through an actor's expressions and articulation, to convey one's subtle or un-subtle emotions, other things are all bells and whistles, but after beholding all those exploits, one has to surrender to a feeling of commiseration, give Leo the damn Oscar!An interesting side-note is that every time DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar in leading role, there is always a collateral supporting nomination for his male co-star, first is Alan Alda in THE AVIATOR (2004), then, Djimon Hounsou in BLOOD DIAMOND (2006), next Jonah Hill in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), and this time the fluke comes upon Tom Hardy (three out of four, save Hounsou, their nominations happen out of nowhere without any significant precursors), who plays Hugh's nemesis John Fitzgerald, although it is a very dark character, Hardy generates great intimidation but as a whole not exceptionally superior to his other works, so the nomination could be conceived as a career-boost for his consistent output and a banner year in 2015 (with MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and LEGEND), although his co-star Domhnall Gleeson, has an even more staggering line-up (EX MACHINA, STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS and BROOKLYN).After my tepid reception towards BIRDMAN, THE REVEMANT complacently shows more potentialities of Inarritu as a visionary auteur, his compassion for the indigenous and scorn to the Western colonisation, are all admiring, only if he could underplay the flourishes a little bit and find some source material more pioneering other than boosting self-worth and endurance, that's my little wishful thinking.",8,1,3,31 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," the government propaganda of individual patriotism mars the film
","Steven Spielberg's 27th feature film is a superiorly constructed retro-pigmented Cold War drama, inspired by the real-life happening of a prison exchange among USA, USSR and GDR in 1957, a fourth collaboration with Hanks, who plays our hero James B. Donovan, a New York lawyer, who is firstly appointed to defend a KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance), and later, he is entrusted by CIA in negotiating the release of the American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), who is captured by Soviet Union during his spy mission, in exchange of Abel, which will be held in East Germany. Meanwhile an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Rogers) has been arrested as a spy by GDR government, but in fact, he is innocent, out of his righteousness, James wants to change the 1-for-1 swapping to 2-1, insist both Powers and Pryor should be released, where CIA's only interest is Powers, so will everything turns out as James hopes?Spielberg sensibly enacts a more true-to-life depiction of the espionage activity in the movie's slick opening, from the Hollow Nickel Case, Abel is introduced as a phlegmatic and practised old- hand, who can steadily erase the evidence while FBI is rummaging his room, and Mark Rylance, a UK thespian, whose theatre achievement is overwhelmingly distinguished, proves that he can upstage Hanks without steeping into theatrics, his portrayal of Abel as a docile, reasonable and undaunted figure leaps out to be the takeaway of the entire movie, with his offhand epigram towards James' impromptu questions like 'are you afraid?' or 'are you worried?'. 'Does it help?' shows his much prepared devotion to his dangerous cause, which is also the reason why he is able to win over James' admiration.Hanks acts in his very comfort zone, being an overall good guy, like his previous effort in Paul Greengrass' CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013), his goody-goody persona, aka, a standing man, has become quite weary, this is where dwells my major beef about the film, the script (with Coen brothers on board) conveniently establishes James as a textbook example of safeguarding the basic human rights without mining into his own inner struggle, as if from the very first moment, he is set about to be the unyielding fighter, against all odds of being the public enemy No. 2 to defend a so-called traitor, even after his own house being attacked, there is no single doubt ever flicking over his complexion about whether he should proceed this taxing case. More excruciatingly, he is also the one who miraculously persuades the jingoistic judge Byers (Matthews) from making a death penalty verdict to Abel by foretelling a possible prisoner-exchange would benefit from keeping Abel alive, and single-handedly accomplishes the tough deal without any assistance (he cannot even stay in the Hilton hotel) in Berlin. Everything tastes like an in-your-face American government propaganda of individual patriotism and the tropes are rather banal and a bit disappointing from Spielberg and co., e.g. the intentional juxtapositions of two disparate treatments of captives between USA and USSR, and an overlong shot of the hand of the GDR lawyer Vogel (Koch) after being denied for a handshake after delivering Pryor.But then, fairly speaking, the film is a stunning accomplishment from the production team and a captivating political drama which reflects the highest quality of Hollywood filmmaking presently, nominated for 6 Oscars this year, apart from BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, the other four are well-grounded (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR for Rylance, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, SOUND MIX and PRODUCTION DESIGN), but one might highly suspect it will go home empty- handedly.",7,1,3,23 January 2016

","If it is a film for fans only, it turns out that I'm not a pious fan of Harry Potter series, which could be the truth, I only read one book (I vaguely remembered it was the third one), still I will be satisfied to watch the final installment next year, even though this one hardly meets my appetite. Okay, let me complain a little bit about the pace, I sense that the trio's road-trip is lengthy and the conflict between Harry and Ron is weakly ensnared (have no idea it is a faithful adaption from the book), and as an average audience, I am very puzzled with the subtraction of how 7 Horcruxes suddenly reduced to 3 after they destroyed one in the film. On the other hand, lots of supporting characters sacrificed their screen-time in order to leave enough stage for the trio, which effectively extinguished a great quantity of fun (poor Snipe only appears in 5 minutes at the beginning). The great side is that even the plot is getting darker and darker, the merrier moments are all deprived from the film, nevertheless this film is not as scare as its recent precedents (only the python scared me a little bit when it jumped out from nowhere, which could have been upgraded as an impressive 3D set piece). The depiction of the three brothers' anecdote is definite the highlight, the scissor-cut cartoon creates an oriental impression and saves the film from the tiredness. I wish I could watch it in an IMAX screen instead of just an ordinary one, but I noticed all the seats were occupied, I think this one will reach a new peak on the box office chart in China for Harry Potter series, maybe 300 million Chinese dollars is not a fool's paradise.",6,0,0,26 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Panda 2
","Saw this one in 3D version at the cinema (4th time this year, after RIO, THOR and Captain Jack Sparrow), my expectation was not too high as I was in a numb state of receiving bombarding Hollywood summer momentum, a yearly-recurrent compulsory course (my sole anticipation lies in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS right away). It turned out that the exotic appeal is roughly null to me (thanks to my Chinese identity), and confidently I can claim that I do prefer RIO after comparison. The Zen-inspired quintessence of the story is all-age beneficial but superficially indoctrinated and without any originality inside, the gags and set pieces are ample but in lack of a punchline. I find the editing is clumsy at some time and thwarts the coherence of the whole picture. The shadow play is a nice trick which makes amends for the corny plot of memorizing Po's provenance. A fully-fledged exploitation of Kung Fu and panda is foreseeable, nevertheless this time no improvement from its precedent, the original cast is on a stable level and new characters like evil peacock Shen and the goat Soothsayer all fall into flat. The 3D effect work much better with animation than other SFX-padded live-action blockbusters, but I think an IMAX 2D could be a better choice. Due to its lukewarm North American box office, if the red-hot 3D trend will be put in a halt or a slow-down, I will be happy to see it (Although very probably the international income will eliminate this idea for the film companies).",6,1,6,9 June 2011
North by Northwest," the most entertaining and mainstream Hitchcock
","An originator of the wronged-man-goes-berserk thriller, Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the ultimate heavyweight which can make its contemporaneous 007 vehicle, say GOLDFINGER (1964, 6/10), embarrassingly pale in comparison. Two of its most visually memorable and elaborately appreciated action sequences of this delectable classic are the murderous crop-dusting biplane and the final cliffhanger on the Mt. Rushmore, still full of vim and vigor upon my first viewing. But it is also a great suspenseful mystery (at least for at the first half) of a mistaken identity, the McGuffin is an agent called George Kaplan, and our innocent protagonist, an advertising man Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for him due to a rather trivial coincidence (which completely evaded me during my viewing) in the beginning. Subsequently Thornhill is framed as a murderer wanted in every newspaper, and hunted by a foreign spy Vandamm (Mason) and his underlings, after several laborious but failed plotting to murder him, including the ill-fated deploy of a femme fatale Eve Kendall (Marie Saint) to seduce him on the overnight 2oth Century Limited, where the romance is budding profusely and the suspicion is naturally engendered. Meanwhile audience get to know the true identity of this secretive Mr. Kaplan, who is merely a decoy concocted by secret services lead by the Professor (Carroll). Yet in their plan, Thornhill is regarded only as an unfortunate canon fodder, who they have no intention to rescue in the first place. Until Thornhill outwits Vandamm's lame scheme and confronts him and Eve in an auction house, only at that moment, the Professor decides to give a helping hand (only because one of his double agent is in danger of being exposed). And for the same season, after knowing the entire story, Thornhill decides to keep playing Mr. Kaplan until the endgame, to seize Vandamm and his cohorts. Initially Cary Grant is maximizing his nonchalant debonair as his usual gambit, as a mommy's boy, his scenes with his mother Clara (a pitch-perfect Royce Landis, albeit who was only 7 years senior than him, thanks to the excruciatingly uninviting ageism in the showbiz) is a hoot to enjoy, and then when peril is piling up, he becomes more alert and agitated in his desperate move to track down who is George Kaplan, although it is hard not to roll one's eyes to the utter hokum that he can swiftly shuttle among the public place without being faintly recognized as a wanted man. Thankfully the two-hander between him and a graceful and deadly charming Eva Marie Saint shots the bull's eye, the age-difference is glaring, but it grabs the attention with Hitchcock's infamous blonde-fixation, Eva comes off lively in her elusive ambivalence, she is irresistible and enigmatic, not until the prompt plot twist, which degrades her into a female prey waiting to be rescued. Mason and Landau make a solid evil pair, the former is urbanely callous while the latter is dourly menacing, but as almost all the villain in the films, their luck is leaking when the film starts, with bad choices of dispatching our hero, and unspecified missteps in the process. I cannot claim this is my favourite Hitchcock's film, PSYCHO (1960, 9/10) is still my current pick, but it is the most entertaining and mainstream fare in his oeuvre, Hitchcock is a master of intrigues, and the film is an enthralling roller-coaster ride in 136 minutes with fun and delight galore.",8,1,2,1 November 2014
Hugo," Hugo
","This year a blossoming homage to the genesis of the film industry has progressed into raptures for film aficionados and filmmakers (two front-runners of the imminent Oscar, THE ARTIST, which I have yet to watch, and HUGO have aimed at B&W silent film and innovator Georges M√©li√®s respectively). Martin Scorsese stews this $170,000,000 budgeted 1930s Paris Gare Montparnasse train station adventure feature in an almost immaculate way, and for the generation which may not be stupefied by Georges M√©li√®s' A TRIP TO THE MOON (Le voyage dans la lune 1902), for sure they will worship Hugo as a pristine monumental milestone for the new era of film business. I saw it in a 2D version and plan to watch the 3D version inconveniently double-bespectacledly. Don't be deceived by its fairytale sphere, a PG rating for Scorsese is a soft ball and none like any other adult-prone masterpieces. But the thrill and tension is still copious and similar to another gem of my 2011 9-out-of-10 league THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, both represent the paramount expectation from a true film master to bake a nutritious meal which is able to assuage everyone's appetite, and both Scorsese and Spielberg have done that this year!Juxtaposing with fellow New Yorker Woody Allen's love letter to Paris (MIDNIGHT IN Paris 2011). Scorsese has accomplished a more imposing one to the witchcraft of the whole film system at its very beginning, which embodies in the up-and-down career of Georges M√©li√®s, and it accompanies Hugo and us to the journey of the pure magic. The retro-setting of the train station is majestic and jaw-dropping, and Howard Shore's fluently enchanting score is the cream of 2011, but a colossal budget has impeded its Oscar's path since its lackluster box office, $61,911,429 so far (which I cannot figure out the reason why? A mishap of a Christmas season decision?) signifies that it will never be profitable and even impractical to make ends meet. And another Achilles heel is it bears zero acting nomination, which I put Asa Butterfield in my leading actor category (2nd to George Clooney so far) and he delivers his grit magnificently in his feeble appearance, as for Ben Kingsley, not as splendid as I hoped, at least he sits comfortably above Jonah Hill from MONEYBALL in my supporting actor list.",9,5,8,7 February 2012
Doctor Zhivago," David Lean's epic running on empty
","David Lean's enterprising adaption of Boris Pasternak's novel (stoutly scripted by Robert Bolt) is a giant box office champion and a five-times Academy winner (although it lost BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR to Robert Wise's THE SOUND OF MUSIC), also it is hyped as a commensurate heavyweight like Victor Flemming's GONE WITH THE WIND (1939), but standing side by side, although Lean's picture can effortlessly sweep its audience off their feet under the salvo of its grandiose production design, picturesque cinematography (D.P. Freddie Young won an Oscar for it) and all other visually-stunning trappings, its characterisation of the two leads, Yuri Zhivago (Sharif) and Lara Antipova (Christie), pales by comparison.Like GONE WITH THE WIND, it is an epic romance fiercely tested by the vagaries of a tumultuous wartime, but unlike Scarlett and Rhett, Yuri and Lara are not quarrelsome, mismatching pair, they fall for each other unconditionally, apart from the damning war and their married status, they are meant to each other unyieldingly, their personality edges have never materialised as a stumbling block between them, which regrettably makes both cardboard characters to watch, notwithstanding Sharif's soulful eyes often moist with tears and Christie is such a drop-dread gorgeous to take our breath away.The frame narrative in the beginning where Yevgraf (Guinness) is looking for the daughter of Yuri (his half brother) and Lara gives away the denouement beforehand, to save non-readers from the anxiety of finding out their ill-fated destiny during the lengthy duration. The story prior to their predestined meeting, namely Lara's liaison with Victor Komarovsky (Steiger, the only American in the cast, a towering presence of moral corruption), an opportunist and the lover of Amelia (Corri), Lara's mother, fans a dumbfounding reception thanks to the elliptical narrative, an ever-so- suspicious strategy to obscure Lara's motivation and her reasoning, pigeonhole her as a 17-year- old lost soul, and cunningly lends a free pass to Yuri's later behaviour, in spite of being a family man with a devoted wife Tonya (an angular and docile Chaplin) and a son, he has no qualms to fall for Lara, since on a subconscious level, they are both 'sinners', caving in to their depravity.Yuri and Lara are apolitical, they are being passively dragged into the whirlpool of revolution and war like the masses, Yuri's duty as a doctor is to save lives, whether they are white or red soldiers, they are all his compatriots, but his poems (strangely enough none of them is being quoted throughout the years-spanning saga), which, as an art form, can be arbitrarily interpreted to conform with any political leanings, become an allegation to him (along with a desertion from Communist partisans). Lara's involvement is deeper, because she marries Pasha (Courtnay, who is the only actor nabbed an Oscar nomination among the ensemble), a radical revolutionist and in due course will become Strelnikov, a scar-faced Bolshevik commander. So Lara's only fate is to flee from her motherland after Strelnikov's doom, and that is something Yuri can never condescend to do, he is a noble patriot, he will not look for her wife and kids in Paris, neither will he go in exile in Mongolia with Lara and Victor, he grasps the nettle to let go of his lover of life, and stays put. Bolt contrives a heart-rending final scene for Yuri, years later, on the tramway he spots Lara on the street, but fails to catch her notice right before dropping dead of over-excitement and his poor health, woefully echoes the beginning: the farthest distance between two people is not life and death, it is when they sit on the same tram-car, but unbeknown each other's existence. That is how fate-twisting life can be!Overall, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO fails to live up to the searing emotional impact LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) once confidently delivered, but given Lean and his team's protracted shooting schedule and onerous work under rather difficult conditions, one cannot have the heart to give tongues no matter how deep the gap is.",7,1,3,14 March 2016
Warrior," The Fighter of 2011
","Thanks to Nick Nolte's Oscar nomination, otherwise very likely I will miss this film (I know I am Oscar-fixated). Directed by Gavin O'Connor, the film is on a par with the recent sport kindred THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), although MMA is much brutal than boxing and the cast is much more downbeat but pragmatic. The film starts with a parallel storyline, a family being torn apart, two brothers haven't seen each other for years, one is a physics teacher with a merry family, but struggle with his young daughter's illness; the other is AWOL ex-marine, suffering from his best friend's ill- fated death, returning to his ex-alcoholic now-sober-for-a-year father, there are deep lacerations in the memories of both brothers, the film intrepidly opts not to use flashbacks to reveal the wounds, instead, through the conversation between two brothers, father and sons, the hallowing past is oozing out in its own pace and comes across as a superbly touching deployment. Later in the tournament, their final knockout combat is being labeled as Underdog Vs. War Hero (Joel Edgerton has to be pummeled like a punch-bag each round before miraculously tackling down his indomitable opponents while Tom Hardy's over-brawny figure alone could intimidate all his pompously grandiose rivals), the fighting scenes are raw but less fly-on- the-wall than THE FIGHTER if my memory doesn't fail me (the final victor is gratifying enough, but I am curious to imagine what the film would end if the winner is the other brother), but like THE FIGHTER, the sport is only the foil, a visual stunt to meet the (bloodthirsty) eyes, a familial drama is the mainstay of the triangle interplay. Nick Nolte is my current No.2 supporting actor of the year, his Oscar-moment is definitely the devastating monologue of Moby Dick after he recollects the alcohol; Edgerton and Hardy are both sacrificing a lot for their roles especially physically, I wish my top 10 slots had more room for them. Actually the truth is Edgerton's part is quite flimsy (although he has proved his versatility), and Hardy's part feels less-exploited and his tough contour is the fatal barrier for viewers to find the access to connect with. P.S: Before I watched this film, one question popped into my mind is why the title is WARRIOR instead of WARRIORS? For the reason that it's a savage winner-takes-all match between two brothers, which one is the warrior refers to?",8,0,3,24 October 2012
Judgment at Nuremberg," the film is a vociferous diatribe towards all the warmongers among the human race
","Stanley Kramer's 3-hours historical courtroom drama about the trial of four distinguished German judges after WWII in Nuremberg by an American court which is presided by Judge Dan Haywood (Tracy), the defendants are not direct participants of neither the combats nor the Holocaust, but do they hold the responsibility of condoning Hitler and the Third Reich's atrocity without interfering with their own divine and authoritative power to forestall all the ensuing heinous horror during the WWII, or before, when Nazi's racial persecution was striking the minority population within Germany under the patronage of law? Are they responsible for the killing of those millions of innocents during the most horrifying genocide in the human history? Based on Abby Mann's meticulous script and a powerhouse cast. Some of the defendants are avid advocates of such wanton injustice, but the sagest among them is Judge Ernst Janning (Lancaster), a prestigious law-maker, whose confession in the third act comes as the most powerful introspection with remorse and grievance of a patriotic German's viewpoint of Hitler and his empire, deluded by Hitler's saviour image, German people are desperate to believe he can save the troubled nation and blindly follows him, even conforms to his radical policies a passing phase for a victorious future. Lancaster is taciturn almost entirely up to his big action here, it is a greatly harrowing confession. Judge Haywood is from a provincial background, rarely gets out of his own country, he is an amiable and easy of approach, Spencer stands out in bringing out a lifelike personage of his character with gravitas and charisma, culminating in the scenes where he pronounces the judgements, understated but each line is so puissant and mind-blowing. Obviously the whole task is a hot potato for him, during the time, political influence is also in the game to sway his verdict, when the impending Cold War is looming large. While getting to know the truth, he befriends a German widow Ms. Bertolt (Dietrich), whose husband is a general and has been executed in a trial and Dan lives in their house which is confiscated after the war. Ms. Bertolt cunningly indoctrinates her innocent identity and persuades him that the most important thing is to look upon the future, as life must go on no matter what. Dietrich is in her early sixties, but radiant in her passive manipulation under the surface of kindness and aplomb. She represents another type of the post-war German mentality, they cannot face the truth, and deceive themselves with oblivion, but the torture is persistent plaguing, her final scene where she is sitting in the shadow when the telephone is ringing, she knows it is Dan to say goodbye, yet her dispassionate silhouette tells everything, her scheme founders, and all the dignified facade is removed, to her Dan is just a chess she fails to manoeuvre, no heartfelt farewell needed, may alcohol can save her soul. The prosecutor is Tad Lawson (Widmark), a US colonel who witnesses firsthand the utterly inhuman savagery in the concentration camps, he is vehement to condemn the defendants and obviously is carried away by implicating the whole nation as the sinner, the perpetrator, his indignation can be vicariously felt by viewers, but for once we can not all stand by his side, which denotes a different irrational extremity. Perhaps, the most formidable performance comes from the then unknown Maximilian Schell, who plays Hans Rolfe, the German defence attorney, and he wins an Oscar for it. Rolfe is very good at his job and over-confident in his professional acuteness of logic to serve his own assumptions. His aggressive but impassioned eloquence can tactfully penetrate the loopholes in key witnesses' testimonies and elicit compassion in the most unlikely scenario, he is a patriot too, he has a clear vision of what Nazi has done, but for him, the only redemption is to save the last remnant of dignity for his homeland, no matter how improper and difficult it will be. Schell invests a great deal of passion, resolution and wisdom in his superb line-delivery of his star-making role. Apart from Dietrich, the film also marks two other Golden Age mega-star's twilight career, it is Dietrich's penultimate screen presence, but for Clift and Garland, their more troubled personal downward spirals are woefully apposite for their characters as two key witnesses here, Clift is Rudolph Petersen, a slow-witted victim of Nazi's sterility operation and Garland is Irene Hoffman, a German woman who is involved with a Jewish man and claims he is only a father figure to her. They galvanize consummately in their very rare foil roles, both are enormously compelling and drastically stirring to watch, especially when audience can detect the traces of their own traumas which can be vividly reflected on screen, alas, both would die prematurely, Clift in 1966 at the age of 45 and Garland, three years later in 1969 at the age of 47. Apart from Schell's win, Tracy, Clift and Garland are also Oscar-nominated, but that year the Academy was adamant to acknowledge new blood, Tracy is trounced by Schell, Clift and Garland and the film itself lost to WEST SIDE STORY (1961), only Mann's writing added a second Oscar to this significantly illuminating lesson one can learn from the most horrifying man-made catastrophe and a telling evidence that law system must not be compromised by political agenda under any circumstances. Although Kramer's directorial endeavour could be comparatively overlooked as the story mostly takes place in the courtroom, and it is the battle of tongue that captivates its audience, his innovation of 360- degree interior shots still can alert one's attention of the mastery behind. In one word, the film is a vociferous diatribe towards all the warmongers among the human race, the scum of the earth!",8,0,3,5 August 2015
The Battle of Algiers," A telling recount of a shocking history in modern revolution
","Algerian Government subsidized and hired Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo to shoot a film to recount the bloody clash between FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front) and French colonial only few years after its independence (1962). The film was not only won GOLDEN LION in Venice in 1966 and an Academy Awards nomination for BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM in 1967 but also was nominated for BEST DIRECTOR and SCREENPLAY in 1969 for a rare second round. THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS impresses its viewers with a haunting collection of close-up portraits of various people (both French and Algerian) under a soul-searching orchestration emphasized by stark chiaroscuro, it was years after Italian Neo-Realism, but the non-professional cast (the only pro is a wiry and bulged-eyed Jean Martin, who commands a stance of military mettle perfectly) and locale-revamping contributes a great amount of authenticity in the final work. There are plenty of overlooking angles with extensive depth of focus to examine and the city and enlighten one's appreciation, plus there are fleeting montages of torture under interrogation are disturbing but can potently generates a sense of boldness to show audience the cruelty in reality. However the most indelible ones are the waiting-for-the-bombs-to-explode experiences, with camera panning over innocent white victims-to-be unwittingly relish their last moment of hedonism, utterly guarantee a surge of compassion out of shock value terms. Therefore, the film should also be extolled by its unbiased perspective in telling its stories from both parts, dispassionately channels viewers to witness the vindictive constitution lying underneath common humanity and the aimless and reproachable tit-for-tat acts ensuring. There are radical debates as regards the essence of revolution, a much more penetrating motto is revolution doesn't mean war and terrorism is not a means to win a revolution, which should be indoctrinated all over the world, especially to those tinderboxes where religious and political threats are pervading rampantly at present. Showing no partiality to either sides is not an easy move since the production was backed and green-lit by one of the government, thus the film is a genuine gem in retaining the integrity and fabricating a gripping panorama of a chain of bloodshed and baring its true color under the stark daylight.",9,0,1,13 September 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook - A boy-meet-girl tale in modern age
","Finally a cinema-going to officially culminate all the Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee of last year, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK treads upon a traditionally crowd-pleasing boy-meet-girl romantic genre while smartly embodying two main characters with distinguished personal mental foibles, which is a masterstroke to keep them refreshing and connected with the present quirk-emancipated modern generation. After his ambitious brothers-boxers drama THE FIGHTER (2010, 8/10), David O. Russell has ascended to the top tier of Hollywood where he can harness marquee stars and meaty source materials, thus, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK has all its edges to be winsome and lovable, but somewhat the final outcome doesn't live up much to the heated expectation, personally I am rather stolid from the American football fanaticism and the 'parley gamble' bidding is by no means a recommendable action to be encouraged (but it is an intrinsic default in the source novel, O. Russell should not take the blame here I suppose), anyway, the scenario does make wonders to gyrate a captivating duo-dance between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, both utterly committed to their characters, verbal ripostes are acetic and sharply accessible. The chemistry sparkles albeit of the age-gap of the actors (a inconceivable 15 years in real life). Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar-crowning has sparked (understandably)controversies (like most of the years), but it is like the film itself, acceptable (for me), the stretch of her character may be impeded by the condescending male-perspective of winning the right girl, why on earth it always ends with a stale 'it is the girl who lingers on the verge of being hurt' plot even under the exception of the mighty confidence discharging from Lawrence's character. Her youth is the double-edged sword in this case, thanks to her mature countenance, audience may not detect it instantly, and the film also bypasses to specify her age. So it is a younger example of Helen Hunt's win and looks like a future Jodie Foster career orbit, plus her Kristen Stewart popularity (THE HUNGER GAME franchise will continue lighting her path), she is the 'it girl' in Hollywood right now and a role model of the industry. Bradley Cooper, a later-bloomer in his leading man status, has seized an unexpected earlier harvest in Oscar-nomination than most of his contemporaries, although constantly in the danger of being overshadowed by his more sapient co-stars, performance-wise, it is his own victory. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, are not in my top 10 list of the year, since the script doesn't challenge them hard enough, but they do reflect the slice-of-life authenticity of the endearing parents (except that De Niro's weeping scene is too maudlin to endure). And forget about Chris Tucker, I don't know why he pops up here to interrupt his satisfactory (both to him and to me) holed-up.So, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale full of mentally unstable people with various neuroses, the steady-cam cinematography looks hipster but also impairs one's concentration, the ultimate dance-routine is mesmerizingly shot, but the banal ending does causing a compulsive meh before the credits rolls, although the final speech is fine and (artificially) sincere.",7,1,1,2 April 2013
Divergent," THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is born
","Following suit of TWILIGHT SAGA and THE HUNGER GAMES, another young adult franchise embarks on its lucrative conquest, DIVERGENT, shares the same dystopia milieu in the future as THE HUNGER GAMES and a teenage female protagonist, Tris (Woodley), who fights to be fit in a world divided by five factions according to five virtues (erudite, dauntless, amity, abnegation and candour), but she is born to be a maverick who defies categorisation and is so-called a divergent. She joins the Dauntless and meets the mysterious Four (James), the trainer of the initiates, together their romance is budding through the training programs; then they discover Erudite leader Jeanne (Winslet) is scheming to annihilate and usurp the Abnegation faction (which is the present authority and where Tris' parents belong) to be the ruling class, meanwhile Dauntless members are hypnotised as the killing machine, only the divergent are immune to it. So by the end of the first chapter of the trilogy, they temporarily sabotage Jeanne's plan, which persists in eradicating the weakness aka. human nature out of human beings, but as cheesy as it sounds, actually love cannot be eradicated. Visual effects are mediocre at its best, the paralleled shift between the virtual and real world is less glamorous but pertinent to the engaging buildup of Tris' character, the mid-way rope- sliding in the night is a catharsis to feel thrilled and emboldened. The white-knuckle, adrenaline-driven, money-spending high point was never set alight, the entire procedure to scotch the scheme looks jejune, the last ditch to turn Jeanne into doing Tris' bidding is a knockout, but before that, the whole plan is a disorganised hash, the puny suspense agglomerated through the acting-like-robots gimmick never pay off, not to mention a hasty design to kill off Tris' parents, who else is psyched and wants to watch Ashley Judd kick more asses? On the philosophical ground, a future nation originated by Veronica Roth actually makes more sense than say, THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10), a virtue-divided society could be an ideal notion if only multiple options are applied. Our current spirit is that we should never be classified as any types, multifariousness is the keynote, so the vehement repercussions of its novel sources are totally justifiable. Shailene Woodley is the key to the success of the franchise, a timid next-door-girl as the first impression, but she has a dogged willpower, dare to chase her dream and bear a heroine's affinity, it is her star-making turn after her breakthrough in THE DESCENDANTS (2011, 8/10). Theo James, memorably remembered in his one-episode only guest appearance in the British sensational hit DOWNTON ABBEY (the unfortunate Mr. Pamuk), is a new rising star, DIVERGENT is his well-suited springboard, it is never too late to be a hot teen throb. Winslet, for the first time as a villainess in a studio project, similar to Jodi Foster in ELYSIUM (2013, 7/10), harbouring a high-flown goal but has little to offer except her evil mindset.I think I will be looking forward to the chapter two because I am hooked to see what will happen in the following step, which I have no clue since I prefer movie to book as a media to chiefly dispense my energy with, at any rate, THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is officially on and a young heart dies hard.",6,2,3,1 April 2014
The White Ribbon," The White Ribbon: 8/10
","Obviously it is not an effortless film to enjoy, Haneke's HIDDEN (2005) is one of my favorite films of all time, in spite of that I admire his works, most of his films' frosty characterizations, restrained accusations are rather uneasy to follow and swallow. So is the case of THE WHITE RIBBON (his Golden Palm winning film in 2009 Cannes), in a completely black-white mode, the film no doubt stands firmly among the best of his magnificent opus. I found it extremely unsatisfying when the end-credits rolled over, there are tons of questions remain unsolved after 160 minutes while over 30 characters were introduced in the film, for sure Haneke doesn't want to give us any definite explanations of the crimes happened, the whole film demonstrates a ubiquitous mental abuse among the German village at the time before WWI (especially towards children), which caused abnormality in their thoughts, the power of poisoned minds was so overwhelmingly dominant so that it would ignite the naissance of Nazi among the next generation while a detectable overthrow of religious paternity was under the way. For me the ace of the film is the camera work by Christian Berger, darkness saturates in every corner of the village, leaves creepiness and shadows on almost every character. The pace is slow but not tedious, several fixed long takes are gripping. There are some excellent performance by Burghart Klaussner (the pastor) and Susanne Lothar (the midwife). Still, it is purely difficult to love this film other than admire it from some distance.Maybe the hidden truth is not important, as every audience has his own version of comprehension, nonetheless, with such a thorough reticence, I think Haneke does underestimate the needs of his audience this time, connotation can be obscure, meanwhile, the film itself hides too many clues, which is able to catch a title as an individual auteur, but for the reverent Haneke, there is indeed no need to take great pains to do so both for him and his devoted groupies.",8,2,5,11 January 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: 7/10
","David Fincher never fails me, even including the underwhelming THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) (which I think I seriously need a re-watch), the American remake of THWTDT is as excellent as its Swedish archetype if not excels in every aspect. Karen O's Led Zeppelin cover Immigrant Song serves as the explosive opening track and dovetails with Fincher's surreal MV-esque opening credit, instantly enhancing the thrill upon to an adrenaline-driven index, eye-dashing, jaw-dropping, so up-to-the-minute yet bespeaks its own attitude, a thriller hipster for this age. The storyline slightly differs from the original Sweden version (the ending is more agreeable for me, a sympathetic outline of Lisbeth plainly strengthens her character with additional authenticity and pathos. I also prefer the cast in this American version, Daniel Craig manages to embellish his rugged complexion with an anti-Bond vulnerability and a morally passive average-Joe journalist, subjectively I opt him over Michael Nyqvist. As for Rooney Mara, under Fincher's guidance, her Tomboy bent (inwardly in particular) has been exploited to an uppermost bloom, the rape-and-vengeance scenes are the aces in the hole (with a more genial appearance of the pervert by Yorick van Wageningen), compared to Noomi Rapace, I just admire Mara more and it's super to see her to re-enact such a ground-breaking female role fervently and sparks dynamically in just 2 years. I must say she is a more attractive girl to any extent . Among the supporting group, Stellan is creepily swell and happy to see a Penn-free Robin Wright with her new look, fringe does make a difference! Trent & Atticus Ross' score is another feat (after a victory foray in THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2010 with new buddy Fincher), the pervasive, humming, quasi-vibration background soundtrack is like a prolonged Post-Rock/Experimental album, highlights the narrative turbulence along the way, until the notoriously basement scene about slaughter fetish. Also Jeff Cronenweth's stunning cinematography is another Oscar-bait, good luck on the Oscars, after snagging a surprising DGA nomination for Fincher and a steady Box Officer implementation, I hope it could make some upheaval in this year's languid Oscar race.",8,2,7,18 January 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Men Who Stare At Goats
","It is a satiric war comedy, as a war-themed feature, it's more unconventional than JARHEAD (2005), which doesn't not prevent the paranormal paranoid backdrop confidently brings a sense of novelty at the beginning.The present story and the flashbacks intwines smoothly, the mysterious Jedi troop set piece is hilarious because of Ewan's presence. However, who would expect that with its unabashed boldness, the second part all of a sudden lost its fuel, tastes like some kind of cheesy pastiche of M*A*S*H (1970), hurries to find a way to reach the end, no matter what it is.The all-male cast is at large squandered, the only exception is George Clooney, who exert himself to be convincing and entertaining as the same time, Ewan is barely detectable as his character is so stock, but at least it is my guilty pleasure to see him in his quasi-innocent devotion while Jeff and Kevin unfortunately need more space to prove their capacity.The film could become a smart war parody and inject a deeper percussion to the audience's senses, as a cinephile it is rather hurt to witness a great idea gone wild.One advice, I saw the DVD in two separate days, my gut feeling is that if one watches it from start to end as a whole, maybe it will emancipate a slightly better appreciation.",6,0,4,21 February 2011
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," a successful fifth entry of a popular movie franchise
","I have watched the fifth vehicle of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series in the local IMAX screen, superb experience! It is directed by Christopher McQuarrie, an Oscar-winning writer for THE USUAL SUSPECTS (1995, 8/10) and previously directed another Cruise's action flick JACK REACHER (2012). The first surprise comes to pass rather immediately when the opening gambit actually is the heavily-marketed stunt of Cruise's Ethan Hunt hanging outside an Airbus A400M during its takeoff, unlike in its predecessor MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL (2011), the tour-de-force of Cruise's awe-inspiring endeavour of conquering the world's tallest building in Dubai, which is deployed in the middle section with much more anticipation. In fact it generates an effective adrenaline rush and kick-starts Hunt and his teams' globe-trotting escapades. Yes, Ethan goes rogue again, and IMF (Impossible Mission Force), under the operation of William Brandt (Renner), is again being dissolved thanks to the insistence of CIA director Alan Hunley (Baldwin). After being captured by Solomon Lane (Harris), the head of a mysterious criminal syndicate, and a narrow escape with the aid of a British double agent Ilsa Faust (Ferguson), who is undercover for MI6. Ethan is dedicated to prove the syndicate's existence in order to save IMF. He recruits computer expert Benji (Pegg) to stop an assassination in Vienna which Lane is the mastermind behind, which fails epically. Later, they will have to accomplish another trademark MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE in Casablanca where Brandt and Luther (Rhames) also belatedly participate, and then stage a caper with the involvement of Prime Minster of Britain (Holland) and Alan's presence, who is there to timely witness the divulgence of the syndicate's background and finally, Hunt has to save Benji, who has been held as a hostage (an ever-corny last second countdown) by Lane and after a challenging mind game and an ensuing night chase in the London alleys, the movie ends with Hunt pulling off a self-congratulatory tit-for-tat to Lane.The plot actually doesn't matter that much as long as the set pieces are excellent enough for audience's ever-demanding satisfaction nurtured by a successful franchise, well, one must admit, it is crafted with admiring brilliance with the high point of the opera house shooting chapter, a super clever move is to graft the action sequences on Puccini's TURANDOT, an opera whose central story revolves around solving puzzles with death at the stake, and the culmination in NESSUN DORMA sparks off a terrific frisson of both thrilling and contentment, a series' best endeavour! Another refreshing element is the addition of a badass female character equal to Hunt, not just an objectified foil, Ferguson's Ilsa Faust is every bit in the centre of the happenings as Ethan, she even saves his life in the pivotal moment, Ferguson's enigmatic charisma and stunning appeal is the showstopper, whereas Ilsa's loyalty becomes the pendulum perpetually hanging in the air, all the more, in the final showdown, her close-range knife combat with the henchman Bone Doctor (Hult√©n) is more enthralling than Cruise's scheme. Plus, there is no cheesy romance between her and Hunt, unlike Cruise and Emily Blunt in EDGE OF TOMORROW (2014). And Hunt is not James Bond, he is never flirtatious, all his intention is to finish the daunting task and never leave his buddies behind, call it bromance in the team if you want, but you know he will never give up Benji for anything, Cruise is as engaging as ever and not everyone buys his star appeal but we must respect his gallantry and the devotion to surpass himself for higher accomplishments, again and again. Among the supporting cast, it is a good sign that the film doles out some action duty To Pegg too in the fieldwork, apart from his usual comical function; Renner, on the contrary, doesn't give anything to show his expertise apart from paying lip service to the bureaucracy; and as the villain, Sean Harris exerts to beam with menace in his mumbling utterance, but as his predestined fate and the wayward obstinacy of never willing to kill our hero when he has the chance, he is as good as we can expect from a not so larger-than-life merciless criminal.As a successful fifth entry of a popular movie franchise has spanned almost two-decades thus far, it is comforting that the picture's success has already green-lit a follow-up, and my only plea is to keep Ferguson in it. Age is just a number for Cruise, and time will prove that he is a much adept action star than Liam Neeson when he edges near the latter's current age, yet one still wonders, will we ever see him back in the spotlight for some meaty work requires more challenging acting chops?",7,0,2,16 August 2015
Dunkirk," we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan
","From a point-of-view of an inveterate pacifist, any war film shouldn't be bothered to watch, whether it wields its anti-war flag or not, because it is either flogging a dead horse or being brazenly repugnant. But when one is made by Christopher Nolan, there is no excuse for a film buff to dodge from facing the man-made atrocity dutifully affixed with adequate dosage of individual heroism gleaming as the silver lining (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a clear forefather), and this is DUNKIRK. Without any question, Mr. Nolan envisions and executes an immersive experience for pampering audience to vicariously partake in the action, its triptych structural arrangement from land, sea, and air with different temporalities starts as a tad discombobulating, but before long would we be utterly blown away by the sheer mastery of its grand-scale imagery and sonic accompaniment, in particular that muffled ticking sound blanketing the infantry pawns as they are continuously besieged by aerial attack, torpedo charge and stray bullets, our protagonist on the land is the Private Tommy, played by a young Tom Courtenay ringer, the rookie Fionn Whitehead, who has no intention to be heroic at any rate when the priority is simply to stay alive. He is first paired with Gibson (Barnard), so as to take a chance of getting on board of a departing warship along with those who are injured, which doesn't work. After biding their time hidden themselves under the mole, they finally land on their feet on another ship, surprisingly, Gibson chooses to stay away from his fellow compatriots, a decision which prompts his life-saving conduct when the ship is sinking underwater, among whom he saves are Peter and Alex (Styles), but the real reason behind that decision will boomerang later, which the ingrate Alex should partially answer for. Here Nolan's script pluckily wrestles with the shadowy underside of the internecine conflicts among the Allies, when nationality hogging the precedence over individual lives. And it is interesting to divine why Nolan doesn't swap the upshots of Alex and Gibson if he really wants to state a point. On the sea, the evacuation aided by boats of civilians brings to the fore of an ordinary family's selfless deeds in a perilous situation, Mark Rylance superbly plays Mr. Dawson, a seafarer who has already lost a son to the war and volunteers to the rescue mission with another son Peter (Glynn- Carney) and a young helper George (Keoghan) in his own boat, en route, they successfully come to aid to a soldier on the flotsam (Murphy, in his best shell-shocked form) and a British pilot (Lowden) almost trapped to death in the cockpit before sailing near Dunkirk, but one might feel a bit disappointed that even Nolan has to predictably yield to the last-second-succor schtick in his own script. The Dawson's involvement also poignantly brings home to us the inconvenient truth: being heroic also entails that one must pay its price, however unpleasant it is. In the firmament, British Supermarine Spitfires (although riddled with malfunctions) engage in dogfight with German bombers, they are the guardian angels of those defenseless earth-bound foot soldiers and unwieldy vessels, Tom Hardy, as one of the pilots, is the ultimate hero specimen, laconic, unfazed and cool-headed, a sublimed understated performance.DUNKIRK's robust box-office revenue bears witness to a reassuring fact that a director's name can still usurp bankability from film stars (whose power is actually dwindling significantly into the 21st century), because auteurism shouldn't only to be ensconced on the art house sphere, it should be the new norm if our film industry needs to prosper, we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan and maybe this time, Academy members can finally cave in.",8,9,17,30 July 2017
The Intouchables," The Intouchables
","Recently I have been caught in the web of Marilyn fever, after MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) and the season finale of SMASH (even Uma Thurman could pull off a slender doppelg√§nger Marilyn), I decide watch this musical/burlesque to quench my thirst and hope to know more about her, the mysterious actress whose shallowness is rather not compatible with our requirement of an eternal icon (after her two more prominent flicks, SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959 and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH 1957).The film pairs a soft kitten Marilyn with a pointed Jane Russell, to counterpart not only the hair color, also conceive two precious opposite temperaments between them, and they're indeed BFFs to each other (at least in the film they claim to be). In this Howard Hawk's vaudeville, with the help of Russell, the showgirl comfort zone is the haven for Monroe to perform right on her own track and never mitigates its plain entertaining function, given that one could forget about the tacky script (one unexplained plot hole, how the detective fathom the whereabouts of the tiara?).The film has been officially crowned as the most successful film in French domestic market (French's much appreciated axiom preferring attendance over grosses), overthrew the 14-year reign of TITANIC (1997). An astonishing victory diametrically wins over the overpowering Hollywood tyranny which prevails in the world elsewhere.Unlike another sensational but more provincial box-office mammoth victor WELCOME TO THE LAND OF SHTIS (2008), THE INTOUCHABLES nudges a more international vantage point, which may suggest a more wide acceptance than the former's parochial stature. We are living in an imperfect world where people are classified as different classes by money, power and social status, the gaps are the invisible barriers deter the evolution of a more equalized and stable society, the film may not possess the magic spell to solve this conundrum, but it has its heartfelt innovation to allow any individual to witness a sincere friendship ignited between a pair with the least possibility.Due to the language hurdle, there are plenty inside jokes which is difficult to comprehend for an outsider, but Fran√ßois Cluzet and Omar Sy are both equally recommendable, although Sy has an edge over since he dominates the most joyful parts and steadfastly handles the more poignant segment as well. Directors-writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano show no rookie mistakes, and sufficiently exercise this true story to distill until its most theatrical fodder being left (although some antics are overdone, the lesbian deployment? There is no need to add gay element in every film), and embroider it with a slickly potent cast which reflects a concise judgment towards the kennel - we should treat each other unbiasedly as a human being, without any prejudice of differentiation of any sort. Ludovico Einaudi's piano score plays a significant role in the film as well, providing this enthralling journey with a passionate catharsis! PS: The film and Omar Sy both end in my top 10 list of 2011!",8,0,1,3 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man
","Watched a 2D version in the cinema, and now the aftertaste is quite irony since the redux deliberately put an 'amazing' in its title, the storyline basically sticks together with Sam Reimi's first instalment, parents left him, grew up with uncle and auntie, bitten by the spider, uncle died, a mad scientist with a genetic mutation, blah blah blah¬Ö (and finally, save the world and lose the girl).Bully scenes are as stale as anyone could imagine, and what makes me sick is the blatant boosting of worship of 'the strongest the best' principle (e.g. Flash's inferior stance of friendship after being humiliated by Peter Park's basketball antics), if this is the canon Hollywood mainstream products consistently not only inculcate Americans' minds, but also export to elsewhere, for which the dictatorial tone really should come under the lash. Competitiveness is beneficial in certain amount, but it is not the most chief way to gain success and fame, period!The biggest feat of this reboot is that they find a rather right couple to enliven the tedious plot, Garfield and Stone both have captivating charisma even though they all have long passed the high-schooler's age, and they are plainly adorable on screen, they can hone up all the hoarse dialogues to a much pleasant tier which one can properly endure with a blithe smile. The villain, Rhys Ifans does make an impact, but hurdled by the role's curbed dimension, barely could be claimed memorable. Let me skip Sheen & Field pair thereafter. About the CGI visual stunts, I remembered the teasing trailer did impress me with its close-up intimacy with all the spider-jumping and swinging, but in the film, luckily the night-time environment has an edgy to the spider-man dangling among the concrete jungle. even without 3D glasses, the vertiginous effect is pretty intimidating, but cannot be completely satisfied. Director Marc Webb, from (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, an 8/10) proves to be no more than a qualified hacker, no superimposition shots this time. Anyway it's typical Hollywood prerogative, we detest it while being ensnared to its resource cornucopia, a dilemma which we have to ruefully swallow.",6,0,3,8 August 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," for McConaughey and Leto
","Riding the tidal wave of accolades and awards recognitions, will DALLAS BUYERS CLUB assist the vehement renaissance of Matthew McConaughey to decisively harvest an Oscar statue as the top honor? The odds are very rosy and clearly he is the front-runner now, the only weighty competitor is his THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) co-star DiCaprio, whose overdue condition may facilitate him to snatch the highest kudos.DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is a dark horse in the BEST PICTURE race and altogether it picked up 6 nominations, apart from BEST LEADING ACTOR, Jared Leto is also having BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR trophy in his bag. Both men's weigh-lost exploits are purely meritorious for the sake of taking 'acting' with full-blooded dedication, which usually works every time, say Daniel Day- Lewis in MY LEFT FOOT (1989, 8/10), or Tom Hanks in PHILADELPHIA (1993), right, the film is also about AIDS, but Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is an out-and-out straight man, a dissolute rodeo actually, who is as parochial as his working-class peers, homophobic, ribald and unlikeable, squandering his life immoderately without repentance. So, when HIV resides inside his body, as if the almighty God generously give Ron a chance to redeem his meaningless life, it is a customary one man's fight against the venal DEA, the monopolized pharmaceutical enterprise and the collusive hospital MDs, but there is a missing point, like many biographical narratives, all the achievement comes rather easily in a way that we audiences never comprehend what makes the protagonist 'the chosen one', as for Ron, it is his macho heterosexuality distinguishes himself from the massive homosexual patients, thus the clash and metamorphosis is very theatrical, but how does he manage to be the pioneer in the business of illegal medicines deserves more detailed dissection. Director Jean-Marc Vall√©e (C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005, 8/10) is not a novice in dealing with gay-themed feature, although DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is more of an assigned job for him, a light touch comes effectively when he wields the rodeo clown metaphor to manifest Ron's inner fear, surreptitious and hallucinating. The make-up team is quite praiseworthy too with so many damaged goods to take care of, the impact is authentically appalling. From denial to acceptance, McConaughey unleashes an energetic personification with electrifying panache, self-destructive, uplifting and utter poignant, Ron is not a likable person, but in the end of the day, he becomes a better man, an unorthodox hero. Leto, on the other hand, sets an immaculate epitome of a woman's soul trapped in a man's body, his most emotive scene is the only time he wears a baggy man's suit to ask help from his estranged father, awkward and uncomfortable, his vulnerability is all over the place. Jennifer Garner, as the good side of the hospital doctors, is almost characterless and generic, a major disappointment in the storyline, her patronizing poise is perpetually obtrusive, it is a character should not occupy so much of her screen time, we would love see more of Leto instead. It is never a winning battle for Ron, the obstacles are too redoubtable to conquer and Ron doesn't have the time either, we might wallow in the staged success, but the reality tells us it is a tough one to hem in the lucrative pharmaceutics within a modulated system, the 'life first' rule certainly is easier said than done.",7,0,1,9 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," a consistent franchise bodes for wonderful potential
","After Matthew Vaughn's X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10) transposes the mutants' universe into 1960s and allows some new blood to play their younger selves, X-MEN series has officially opened a new chapter. Three years later, the original helmer (X-MEN 2000, 7/10 and X2 2003, 7/10) Bryan Singer returns to the director chair to push a reset button to nullify all the damages done by Brett Ratner's X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006, 7/10). In this latest episode, the story devises a time-travel mission to the past in order to save the entire world from the Sentinel apocalypse. With many cast members of the first three X-MEN movies reprise their roles, fanboys will hurrah to welcome back McKellen and Steward pair as the old Magneto and Professor X, with their disciples Storm (Berry), Kitty Pryde (Page), Iceman (Ashmore) and a handful of new characters in the near future, facing their common enemy, a robot army composed of killing machines named Sentinels, originally designed by Dr. Bolivar Trask (Dinklage) to obliterate mutants, but things go out of line, an indiscriminate massacre is endangering the whole planet. So they send Wolverine (Jackman) back in 1972 to stop the Trask assassin executed by Mystique (Lawrence) would directly spur the advance of the prototype Sentinel maturing into the indestructible destroyer. And the paralleled worlds engage a race against the clock, the impending doom vs. the eleventh-hour history-shifting decision. One much-hyped staple of the franchise is the frenemy between Professor X and Magneto, under a more liberal context now, the younger two (played by McAvoy and Fassbender respectively) construes a more (b)romance-inclining attachment to incite devotees' enthusiasm, yet this time around, McAvoy gains the upper hand with a tough inward struggle to crucify, through a fictional vis-√†-vis with his older self, his character has a transcendent enlightenment while Fassbender is recycling the same character from the previous chapter with more flashy CGI- laden spectacles.Wolverine is the nominal leading role, but in fact, he doesn't have too much action sequences to handle and is cast away before the crux arrives, Mystique, thanks to Lawrence's current much marketable star power, becomes the game-changing MVP amongst all the participants. As a Chinese, I cannot overlook the red-hot Bingbing Fan is cast as Blink, finally a role with sensible potential for her Hollywood moonlighting. Also worth mentioning, Evan Peters' Quicksilver steals the limelight with his time-frozen exploit makes THE MATRIX trilogy's bullet time pales in comparison. The film is a tightly orchestrated by a cliff-hanging urgency, accompanied with a cogent script maximally facilitates the story development to be assimilated even by a novice in the mutants club. A great art design accomplishment to restore the 70s milieu, while the make-believe future settings are ominously fashioned as a video game production.The franchise is consistent in my rating system, a 7/10 is a tremendous achievement considering I am not a comic book adherent, and the promising ending beckons a pristine start is on the horizon since everyone survives the forbidding annihilation, a solid building block cements more excitement will ensue in the follow-up X-MEN: APOCALYPSE in a two-year span.",7,0,0,27 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," The Avengers 3.0
","We are in an era when MCU (Marvel Comic Universe) productions become a tentpole staple one finds rather too big to ignore on the radar, once or twice a year, there is impending danger of being ad nauseam. Re-reading my extolling review of CAPTAIN American: THE WINTER SOLIDER (2014), I am trying to figure out why the thrill has faded quite a lot this time.There is no shame to admit that the action-packed superheroes scuffle set pieces are the highlight, as in two THE AVENGERS, in fact the movie should be renamed as THE AVENGERS 3, which could take a more impartial stand in the internecine war. Maybe one shouldn't call it war, there is disagreement, but not so serious, which makes the two teams' group fighting look more than a grandstanding drill, every and each one is too valuable to kill off (since they have an entire future universe to plan), even the sidekicks, War Machine is the closest one to be dispatched, right, Don Cheadle still needs the big cheque to finance his personal projects like MILES AHEAD (2015), his director debut biography about Miles Davis. This 'play house' frivolity becomes the hot-bed for bathos (Vision is unfortunately underused for his puissance, in order not to cause casualties, he even has to accidentally undermine his own teammate), that's why by comparison DC's BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE (2016), self-serious as it is, still eclipses this one in its narrative coherence and dialectics. If the script could reveal the key twist earlier, which would give a perfect personal excuse for a more substantial battle pathos (Bucky Barnes could be a ruthless killing machine, right?), which only fleetingly takes place in the small-scale finale, so, this is Marvel's tenor, (notably antagonises DC Comic's darkness and solemnity) - why so serious?Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Tom Holland's young Spidey are competent comic relief, the former's low self-esteem can be perpetually milked to induce laughters and the latter's garrulousness as a rookie superhero can only be matched by the rogue iconoclast DEALPOOL (2016). Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is introduced to ensure a more politically correct leaning (the first one born in Africa), so what's next? Asian or Latin American? Or an LGBT addition couldn't be more exigent.Action scenes are sleek, often in close-range which causes some hand-held ricketiness, the indelible ones are Bucky's motorcycle hijacking stunt and Captain America's bulging biceps when holding a helicopter single-handedly. The ordinary human background of Zemo (Br√ºhl) gives his motivation a more visceral arc, but as most villains in the franchise, the chance to consummate their scheme is largely stacked with random happenings other than meticulous plotting (why on earth the script would allow an imposer of an interrogator infiltrates the faculty so easily, as if no one there has ever met the original interrogator?).A lethargy has been officially reached after this chapter, for me, at least, one needs more time to overcome it, sadly there is no stopping of it, next instalment is THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), which might explain to us the reason of Thor and Hulk's jarring absence in the fracas on earth, where is apparently too small and crowded for super-humans, deities and monsters, preparing for the next round!",6,3,8,8 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal
","J. K. Rowling's magic realm reopens with this first installment of a 5-picture deal, directed by wizardry old-hand David Yates, adjusts the time back to 1926, New York City and introduces us a new protagonist, the 29-year-old Newt Scamander (Redmayne), a self-consciously introvert wizard, carries a suitcase which contains all the heterogeneous beasts he has captured all around the world, although, some naughty ones constantly sneak out into the world of No-Maj (a precursor term of Muggle), and unleash some considerable commotions, notably the cutesy Niffler, a relentless, reckless and ravenous treasure-hunter. Newt's pursing action in a bank catches the attention of Tina, a delegated former Auror employed by the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), also causes his suitcase unintentionally swapped with the one belongs to Jacob Kowalski (Fogler), a portly No-Maj who fails to get a loan to open his pastry shop. The triad soon will be joined by Tina's mind-reading sister Queenie (Sudol, aka. the musician A Fine Frenzy), woozily inveigles herself into a tabooed romance with a No-Maj, but, it is the Jacob-Newt pair gets the full treatment of a constellations of awesome beast-hunting exploits.Meanwhile, a mysteriously destructive dark force, later identified as Obscurus, wreaks havoc in the city, killed a bigot Senator, Percival Graves (Farrell), the head of Magical Security of MACUSA, yokes the advent of Obscurus to Newt's arrival (indeed there is a dormant Obscurus captured by Newt inside his suitcase), but on the sly, Graves also coerces a young Credence Barebone (Miller) to locate the human host of the amorphous Obscurus with his own ulterior motive, on the grounds of a quid pro quo to extricate Credence from his abusive stepmother Mary Lou (Morton), a No-Maj extremist against witchcraft. In the process, Newt and his friends must save themselves from the persecution from MACUSA and during the climax, when a rampant Obscurus threats to expose the witchery universe to the whole world, it falls on Newt and his fantastic animals' shoulders to do the reparation job, a finale sounds like boilerplate on paper, but in fact, emanates a feeling of cleansing solace owing to its visual and aural grandeur. First time takes on the sole credit for the script, Rowling timely orchestrates a storyline simmering with a cauldron of repressed torment from an anomaly, whilst adheres to the family-friendly, mass- appealing tenet, punctuated with a kaleidoscope of SFX creatures to lure any goggle-eyed audience. Among the core triad, Redmayne walks us through the journey with his unaffected self- effacement, Waterston engages us with a competently innocuous impression in the traditional heroine mode and Fogler makes for a sufficient comic foil tailing around as a proxy of us Muggle onlookers. A key revelation may suggest Farrel's future involvement with the franchise would be blunted, after being supplanted by an even more named star, however for my money, Miller upstages others to demonstrate his versatility, he can go very dark if necessary, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN-style. By and large, the film sets a solid first step to usher the large demography of Harry Potter fans to a similar milieu after a 15-year stretch (bar those have become too skeptical to take the story seriously) and establishes Newt in a grown-up Harry image as our sympathetic guide, hopefully, peddles new audience at the same time even if the whole enterprise feels like being constructed by rote and commonality, that is what masscult for, isn't it? p.s.: The 3D format I watched is rather murky and blurry, which as usual, is poles apart from its pristinely clear quality from its trailer, always a disheartening factor to put potential viewers off from cinema-going, since Blu-Ray DVDs are only several months away, 3D, once an eye-catching pull, now has legitimately become a thorn in our flesh in its stalled technological progress.",7,1,3,27 November 2016
Jackie," JACKIE exude a rare stirring frisson that eludes most biopics of recent years
","A disclaimer, this reviewer's unforgivably limited knowledge pertaining to Jackie Kennedy before watching this biopic only encompasses that she was the wife of JFK and a poised portrait evinces an uncanny physical resemblance of a Jeanne Tripplehorn in her prime. Under the rein of Chilean director Pablo Larra√≠n, his first venture in wrestling with an American historical figure, his outsider status lends JACKIE a rapier-like sobriety in balancing between a complaisant hagiography and a demythologizing sensationalist. An unconventional approach is the time-frame, unlike most fares of that ilk which often adopt a blanket method to encapsulate its subject's life trajectory within a sweeping time-span, JACKIE revolves only around JFK's assassination, the tragedy precipitates a switcheroo which starts to disintegrate Jackie's composure, she is beleaguered with mounting and daunting personal corollaries (moving out of the White House, arranging the funeral particulars, informing her tots of their father's death, etc.) and emotional aftermath (a bereavement so unexpected and would completely shatter her status quo), not to mention the shock imposed by the grisly horror which she has experienced right before her own eyes. Noah Oppenheim's trenchant script delves profoundly into Jackie's frame-of-mind during that particular period, and peels off her stately, comely bearing to lay bare the essences, a human being undermined by the post-trauma complex, both rationally and emotionally, for example, more than once, she backtracks on the decision of a grand parade for the cort√®ge, and battles with her own conscience, is that pageantry a right move to preserve JFK's legacy or a vanity project for herself when she still can, since the aureole is doomed to fade after her status delegates from the First Lady to a famed widow.Setting the film with a frame story of Jackie (Portman) interviewed by a journalist (Crudup) a week after the tragedy, then piecing together the narrative from various fragments before-and-after, Larra√≠n treads light on flashbacks which precede the central snafu, the preponderance of which consists of the black-and-white recreation work where Jackie making an introduction tour of the White House for a television program, her diffident yet elegant, but essentially very much calculated public veneer. Also Larra√≠n, as one might expect if familiar with his oeuvre, doesn't flinch from showing us the brutal violence with utter verisimilitude and has no intention to aggrandize the lovey-dovey schmaltz between a married couple, Jackie barely makes any remarks on JFK in a personal way in the wake of his death, guilt has a knock-on effect on her though, 'I could have shielded for him' Jackie confesses, but surprisingly, we don't get the feeling it is because her deep love for him other than an onus she fails to commit, because it comes at a point when she ponders upon death by bravely walking side by side with JFK's casket in broad daylight, yet the irony is that after her husband is out of the picture, her collateral position doesn't have enough leverage to put herself on that slate as a worthwhile assassination target. Natalie Portman, does go off the beaten track to gird herself for a role (that distinguished accent alone is quite an achievement for its own sake) which will stand cheek by jowl with BLACK SWAN (2010) as top feathers in her cup, a full-bodied incarnation deserves every honor she receives, she magically combines Jackie's allure with sophistication, wits with wiles, vulnerability with moxie, never shies away from the ever-dominant close-ups trying to elicit and convey every single shift of Jackie's emotional niceties. Among the support group, Peter Sargaard gets his shine as Robert F. Kennedy, who takes on a contradicting role both as Jackie's consoler and her competitive griever; the late John Hurt strobes in one of his final works to pass wisdom and guidance as the priest and Billy Crudup brilliantly plays against a barnstorming Portman in their battling t√™te-√†-t√™te. But let's not forget Greta Gerwig, who plays Jackie's confidant Nancy Tuckerman against her usual type of hipster, provides the sole shoulder for her to cry on, and they crystallize a beautiful friendship between women which is not tainted by any venom of the world. Indie musician Mica Levi's predominantly eerie and spasmodically strident string score is another distinction of this off-kilter biopic, like its reference of Camelot in the story, which brings something earthy and in-congruent in the rarefied air of political import, makes up as an indispensable constituent of Lorra√Æn's sterling team, which allows JACKIE exude a rare stirring frisson that eludes most biopics of recent years, even for those who are not familiar with its real- life subject.",8,1,2,15 March 2017
Underground," anarchic, droll, perverse, intermittently delirious and fantastical
","UNDERGROUND, Serbian boy-wonder Emir Kusturica's fifth feature saga sanctifies him as a lofty two-time Palme d'Or winner, a coterie whose total number has just recently been changed to eight with Ken Loach's I, DANIEL BLAKE (2016). Traversing over half a century, from WWII in 1941 to the Yugoslav Wars in 1992, UNDERGROUND is Kusturica's passion project which orchestrates his surrealistic idiosyncrasy to the full bloom under a vast canvas of historical reality (using, sometimes tampered, real-life archives). A central triad of this epic is Marko Dren (Manojlovic), Petar 'Blacky' Popara (Ristovski) and Natalija Zovkov (Jokovic), Marko and Blacky are best friends, communist warriors during Nazi's invasion of Belgrade, both fall under the spell of Natalija, a theatre actress has no political predilection and only wants to survive in the war-torn quicksand.From the onset of Part One: War, an air-raiding sequence in the zoo which will precipitate the concern from animal-loving viewers, Kusturica teasingly vouchsafes the overall tenor of his approach: anarchic, droll, perverse, intermittently delirious and fantastical, while the narrative jumps with an irregular heartbeat sometimes can be bewildering and far too outlandish to elicit viewer's investment, but one can hardly resist its energetic defiance and raucous roughhouse, as well as the infectious Cs√°rd√°s dance, all aligns with a strenuous, mostly studio-bound mise-en- sc√®ne. The biggest conceit appears in Part Two: Cold War, Marko's elaborate whopper that keeps Blacky and others, including Marko's stuttering younger brother Ivan (Stimac), living underground for 20 years in a huge cellar, the time now is 1961, by telling them and consistently providing evidences that WWII is still ongoing and they must hide and do their best job, manufacturing weapons, to support their country. Meantime, on the ground, Marko and Natalija become an official item and ascend on their rungs of political ladder, to a point Marko becomes one of Tito's closest associates. A rapier-like progression of Marko from a hot-blooded freedom-fighter to a profiteering warmonger astringently undermines the overarching patriotism. Both Marko and Natalija are afflicted by their mounting guilt over the web of lies, and their frailties start to become their undoing during the subterranean wedding of Blacky's son Jovan (Todorovic), who has never seen daylight in his entire life, and soon would wish that he had never been to the outside. The wedding is a cacophony of celebration and ruckus, flying bride, chimp-in-a-tank and a rotating band never ceases to fashion razzmatazz of brassy euphoria. The ensuing Blacky's revelation of the real world coincides with a wry and travestied movie- shooting of his heroic past, where dead ringers accentuate its grotesque brutality; on another subplot, Ivan also walks close to reality, but what he finds is a series of dusty underground passages leading to Berlin and Athens, which is even wackier than his own backstory. In its final chapter, Part Three: War, the time-frame forwards to 1992, Marko and Natalija meet their comeuppance when warfare again sets its ravage in motion upon this troubled land, Blacky can only reminisce about his deceased friends and love with a fallen Jesus Christ adjacent, eventually, in the dream-like coda, merriment drifts offshore, into oblivion, as all the victims of the war, after all, the satire is on ourselves, we are all, more or less, are complicit in our self-destructive thirst to destroy and conquer, whether it is power, money, or woman. A meritorious enterprise from Kusturica, performance-wise, Manojlovic and Ristovski are two cracking examples of lunacy and gallantry on screen, but Ristovski is less consistent hampered by Natalija's ambivalent temperament. UNDERGROUND is dazzlingly gonzo, but pungently allegorical, it can never appease all those who are involved, but should be prized for its boldness and ingenuity, but a Palme d'Or? Maybe its 1995 line-up is not that impressive in retrospect.",8,1,1,17 December 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World
","After watched the film, I seem to know why I have no interest in video games at all, I would rather waste my time on anything else. The truth is that I had enjoyed director Edgar Wright's previous films HOT FUZZ (2007) and SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) (both starred with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). Love it or hate it, it's a film eyeing for the geeky culture and the generation of video games, I stand firmly in the opposite of it as I find it tedious (seven ex-bfs? why we have to watch Michael Cera's ass being kissed multiple times and then he stroke back to knock over his stronger opponents by some gratuitous trickeries?). Is there anything recommendable I could squeeze? The special effects are dazzling, some dialogues are funny, but not tangible, the whole film is a big disappointment to me, no wonder it underperformed in the box office as well, as its direct target is indoor otaku, whom I am sure prefer staying at home playing video games rather than going to cinemas to watch someone else playing it. Maybe sales of the DVD market is the right strategy. As for the cast, Michael Cera has been a symbol of man show geeks since JUNO (2007), so there is no real breakthrough here, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is way too cool for a comic role (yes, it just occurred to me the film is an adaption of a comic series), others are fine, not worth mentioning except it was glad to see poor Brandon Routh back in the business.",5,11,22,24 January 2011
Inside Out," my Pixar island will never be thrown into the memory dump
","Pixar's latest offer is an absolutely worthwhile adventure for adults and teenagers alike (certainly not for toddlers), makes further efforts to forever change the existential territory of animation feature, it is our generation's great blessing to have Pixar continuously giving life to such master-class animations, which defy the temptation of huge profits from low- hanging fruits, as DESPICABLE ME series and its spin-off THE MINIONS (2015) unblushingly cashes in on.Anthropomorphising our emotions into five singular entities, Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Disgust (Kaling), Fear (Hader) and Anger (Black), which reign over every single individual's daily life (not just humans, critters like cats and dogs have them too), might sound a bit dumbed-down on paper, clearly we all aware that we have much more important emotions other than this major five (which is my only hiccup with the setting, especially for adults, more emotions need to be discovered as we grow up, such as pride, shame, jealousy, honesty, guilty etc.), but five is sufficient enough for our protagonist Riley (Dias), a 11-year- old girl whose main emotion is Joy, but now she is experiencing a difficult time when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.Anyway, this is only a hindsight, the film itself is bursting with whimsical and eye-opening pizazz and it magically constructs a visual and logical splendour of how our brain is working, from the headquarter where 5 emotions work, to the personality islands which created by core memories, to a long term memory labyrinth where memory balls are stalled and constantly cleansed with a train of thoughts doing all the transportation in-between. Then the more innovative cerebral designs, such as the abstract thought zone, where three- dimensional figure reduces to one-dimensional and bespeaks the immaturity and instability of Riley's young brain (a great visual deviation); the dream production, imitates a hectic film crew to re-enact the daily happenings with farcical verisimilitude for Riley's dreamland; in the subconscious world lies our worst nightmares, for Riley, it could be a walking broccoli or a giant clown and finally, the memory dump, where everything will vanish from Riley's memory forever, also a poignant moment occurs as we say goodbye to Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Kind), whose is hoping for reconnect with Riley, but in reality, they only descend to oblivion when we grow up. All the ingenuity is convincingly relatable for everyone, and tailor-made with what Riley undergoes in her life, who loses her important personality islands one by one, after Joy and Sadness incidentally are sucked out of the headquarter through the transporting tube when Joy is busy at keeping the blue Sadness at bay from the 'happy' memory balls. The remaining trio emotions make a great mess while Joy is intent on getting back until she realises she may not be the key emotion to implement the overhaul and save Riley from her impractical running-away plan. The two parallel worlds are perfectly meshed together, the cause-and-effect interactions are brilliantly carried out thanks to a rigorous script sprinkled with grade A humour and sincere emotional projection. And the centre message it inculcates is extremely edifying, we should embrace all the emotions, especially do not underestimate the power of sadness, through sadness, one can face the true feelings and that's what makes us a qualified human being. I watched the picture in its 3D format, and it is preceded by a 7-minutes short LAVA, directed by James Ford Murphy, a charming love story about two lonely volcanoes with inspiring artistry. One must give kudos to the team headed by Peter Doctor, the mastermind behind MONSTERS, INC. (2001, 8/10) and UP (2009, 9/10). And as long as I live, I promise, my Pixar island will never be thrown into the memory dump, INSIDE OUT is my current best film of 2015 and if any this year's upcoming films can excel it, 2015 will be a great year of cinema in my book!",9,7,28,9 August 2015
The Dirty Dozen," THE DIRTY DOZEN's male-pandering slant might take some shine off its conventional appeal as a devil-may-care entertainment
","'But before that preposterous, patly formulated, but unsettlingly vicious climax, the film is actually brimming with lulz in its military drilling process of assessing, bonding and carousing, a gripping momentum never slacks, culminating in a stock victory of a rag-tag of underdogs punching above their weight to outfox regular soldiers during the war games in England, by that time, audience may even begin to invest in those hardened criminals with a smattering of compassion, not least to Robert T.

Gone with the Wind," GONE WITH THE WIND hasn't gone with time
","Some movies you always know you will watch and you must watch, simply because it is a must-see and GONE WITH THE WIND is definitely one of them, hailed as 'the greatest film of all time', how can I hold it up until now? Personally I can never find a right time to watch it not just because of its nearly 4-hour running time, also subjectively I am not a fan of Clark Gable, as he perpetually reeks of bad breath (thanks to the IMDb trivia section to ruin his silver-screen charisma for me), and feel daunted by the melodramatic nature of its source novel from Margaret Mitchell, but the moment has finally arrived and I have watched it for the very first time, and it is as good as I could ever anticipated, although with an epithet like 'the greatest of all time', how can any film hold out on that supreme crown unscathed? The movie is an American civil war saga entirely enters on Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), a crafty Southern belle whose comfortable life has been ravaged by the war, oscillates between the man of her dream Ashley Wilkes (Howard), who marries Melanie (de Havilland), a girl with all the virtues of that bygone era, and her similar kind, the rich pursuer Rhett Butler (Gable), it takes her three marriages, two dead husbands, one miscarriage, a devastating loss of her young child to finally realise her deepest love for Rhett, only in the end, she is unable to mend her fence with the overdue repentance, she has been a fool to chase her ideal yet unrealistic passion for Ashley, which is merely an illusion for her to grasp in troubled times. So she is the only one to blame for all the misfortunes? Almost eighty years later, my take is that Ashley and Rhett are equally accountable for the love triangle tug-of-war, it is the battle of sexes, Ashley is too weak-minded to disclose the wrong facade of his true feelings towards Scarlett, or, even worse, he gloats in the admiration of a woman who adores him as the specimen of a perfect man, either ways, he cannot be exonerated for acquiescing Scarlett's unrequited ardour. As for Rhett, his frivolous manner firstly establishes a wrong impression that he is a philanderer, charming but never the marry kind, and when he realises his feelings for her, his devotion is markedly undermined by jealousy, which only pushes Scarlett farther away, so why on earth he can act as all the justice is on his side and desert her when she eventually wakes up from her protracted mirage? On the other hand, it is all their imperfections make them a perfect match for each other, for sure their life together will not be perfect, but they cannot stand one without each other, that's the essence of monogamy.One sure thing is that the film's epic production scope and grandiose settings signal the hallmark of Hollywood's cutting-edge creativity and capability at then, its vividly expressive cinematography alone can captivate the utter veneration from even the fiercest dissenter. It is so incredible, how come Victor Fleming can master two cinematic juggernauts (this and THE WIZARD OF OZ, George Cukor is the poor guy uncredited with both pictures) in one calendar year, 1939 is really the high tide of the world cinema, symbols the celluloid industry enters its full-grown era. An iconic performance from Vivien Leigh, her Scarlett is never a damsel-in-distress, she is a spoilt and wilful brat at first, life is too easy for her to get what she wants, but her iron- willed personality has been mould after the baptism of the civil war, nothing can pull her back into poverty, she has a cunning mind of manipulation, mostly towards men who are too upright to run away from her smug calculations, only Rhett is her match to fence back, but she saves her most precious and vulnerable part for Ashley, and involuntarily grows close with Melanie too. As a Briton, Ms. Leigh brilliantly nails the southern accent, wholeheartedly teases out Scarlett's rite-of-passage and culminates a timeless performance allows generations to idolise. The same cannot be said to Clark Garble and Leslie Howard, male characters are uniformly given less range to leave the same impression as Scarlett, or even Olivia de Havilland's Melanie, who undertakes the burden of being an immaculate saint, fully embodies all the good virtues of humanity, but must face the cruelty of destiny, it is a tremendous blessing Ms. de Havilland is still with us today, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish she will safely pass her centenary 1st July next year. One cannot review this film without mentioning Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win as the faithful servant Mammy, in retrospect it is exactly what one would expect from under that social current, sans the horror one might trigger from 12 YEARS OF SLAVE (2013). Despite that her view towards the war has never been explored on the screen, anyhow it is a war under the name of abolishing slavery, yet she never leave O'Hara family even in the worst times, maybe her side of story can more accurately point out the sinister nitty-gritty of war, any kind of war, no matter under what name men are fighting their lives for, it is always a go-to manoeuvre to openly sacrifice innocent lives in exchange of benefits for the few ones, and it is a crime at any rate. Sorry for the digression, all in all, the film is a worthy classic, a bit too mushy in its second half for my taste, but one cannot hold too much grudge against it for all the genius involved and the first-rate end-product it hatches, an 8 out of 10 is my verdict.",8,5,9,8 June 2015
District 9," District 9 - Overrated
","DISTRICT 9 is the final film of 2009 Oscar BEST PICTURE nominated films I saw (what a relief!), nevertheless I still hold the opinion that it is unwise to double the numbers as an awkward truth is that at least half of these films are plainly fillers (for example, this one), it only makes the ceremony longer and offers these fillers some popularity. It seems to me that DISTRICT 9 is an overrated film, surely it has its own singular novelties such as its pseudo-documentary shooting, low-budget cost (30 millions) and carries an indie halo to subvert the Alien Vs. Human platitude. The story brings to the audience an intensely compact experience after 20 minutes until the end, but all the set pieces are far from innovative (for example 1. the most unimaginable way to take back the fluid in the lab is to snatch it simply like what the film shows; 2. the evasive usage of the precious fluid whose small amount takes a whole 20 years to produce, of course the background of these prawns is eschewed as well; 3. the stereotyped design of the villainous military man, to kill prawns without a cause as he is just loving to do so), unfortunately it's only breath-taking rather than mind-blowing. The low-budget quality also hampers the film from taking a more grande scale to see the alien sides (the mothership), in which fans are mostly interested. Another flaw is the ending, maybe they did run out of money, which is nothing to complain, it ends hastily without a clue of what will happen next (a sequel is promisingly under the way I suppose). Actually if we substitute any other disadvantaged group (the poor, the disabled, the distorted, etc.) with these prawns in the film, the film is able to remain intact, maybe less fun. The political attitude is obvious but I feel numb about it since it is banal. As his full-length debut, one must admit Neill Blomkamp has done a great job, his future is bright (should thank Peter Jackson too), I am looking forward to his new project, however I sincerely wish him that the best is yet to come. PS: After seeing all 10 BEST PICTURE NOMINEES, I would replace STAR TREK with DISTRICT 9 and A SINGLE MAN with A SERIOUS MAN, period.",7,2,7,7 November 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Better than the first chapter
","Coming to cinema two months later in Mainland China, the second chapter of THE HOBBIT TRILOGY is poised to prevail the box office in a rather lethargic period after the red-hot Chinese Spring Fe festival. THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012, 6/10) is a relentless roller-coaster ride with a slew of visual stunts to propel a succinct plot, which doesn't live up to the expectation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS' Middle Earth triumphant standing, also Peter Jackson's innovative shooting technology has received with some resistance and negative feedbacks. The second round, a 3D version is all we have in China, the palette is light-toned, the textual sharpness hasn't been refined from the first one, a tad dim and the same landscape doesn't register the same rapt effect anymore. Nevertheless, the film is an ameliorated update from AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, not simply because of Smaug's imposing grandeur and droll garrulousness (voiced by a malignantly intoning Cumberbatch). The plain narration bifurcates from the early start, when Gandalf (McKellen) detaches from the rest of the expedition on a solitary quest, as it often pans out, the journey without the omnipotent grey wizard galvanizes more excitement and comic relief. The action set pieces are imbued with sufficient antics in the barrel cruise, the comeback of Legolas (Bloom) and a freshly coined female elf Tauriel (Lilly) reinforces audience's modern aesthetic as a welcoming love triangle among the two and a handsome (and slightly taller-than-average) dwarf Kili (Turner) is a clever deployment to gratify a touch of romanticism and conforms with the topical love equity enthusiasm. The pulchritude of slaughtering orcs with dexterous archery can never stultify the viewers. When Bilbo (Freeman) lurches into Smaug's turf to exert his burglar role, it prompts the zenith with the disparate duel between the dwarf pack and the indomitable fire-generator, it is also worth mentioning the dissonant atmosphere between Bilbo and Thorin (Armitage), is the hobbit only an expedient pawn for Thorin's stout-hearted vengeance to reclaim his kingdom, or the boundary of species can be breached through Bilbo's valorous altruism? Let's wait and see what will happen in the final venture. This time, one might be able to distinguish the 13 dwarfs more easily besides Thorin, Balin (Stott), Kili and Fili (O'Gorman), Freeman is consistently indulged in his invisible vantage with the ring, while McKellen's Gandalf has some perilous path to overcome. The film is properly enlightened by several new characters, apart from Tauriel's apropos feminine touch, Bard (Evans) is the key character introduced here, and for certain his import in the finale is well hinted although we haven't seen too much potential in him yet. And it is always a delight to watch Stephen Fry, sketchily appears as the Master of Laketown, quips with his insidious underling Alfrid (Gage). As a middle section of a trilogy, this film actually skirts the conundrum of being left in the epic and enmeshed background without a certain closure to end the film itself, it is both satisfied to see to a not out-and-out victory and intrigued to imagine what will happen when the dragon is released to a more spacious scale, all magnetizes its core audience to return for a third time.",7,1,3,27 February 2014
Toy Story 4," TOY STORY 4 plays fully up to our nostalgia and manages to squeeze something instructive out of the old gangs on a similar territory
","'Therefore, the film aptly paves the way for a more forward-thinking mythos, what if a toy doesn't need its human owner for self-actualization? Which comes patently obvious when Bo Peep re-enters Woody's life, now is a proud 'lost' toy who has no kid to answer for, but a cohort of toy friends, living off on the amusement park where Bonnie's family tentatively visits. After the white-knuckle escapade aiming to rescue Forky from the nominal villain Gabby Gabby (Hendricks) - a soft-spoken doll with a broken voice box, who hankers for being cherished like a real toy, and her henchmen of sinister-looking ventriloquist dummies in an antique shop, a wild rollercoaster ride is exactly what audience bargains for, though, the subplot about Buzz Lightyear (Allen) suffers in significance, while the Key and Peele duo assumes the duty of tickling our ribs as the plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and a spirited Keanu Reeves has a ball as Duke Caboom, a Canadian stuntman action figure, the victim of advertisement aggrandizement.'read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8,2,2,6 January 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," Wreck-It Ralph
","A 3D cinema-going for the weekend of this latest Disney animation (by the luckiest chance I found one in its mother tongue). Being mainly ignorant towards the video games territory, which surprisingly did't impede my joyous time with this well-manufactured cartoon.Disney has cleverly introduced a novel space of wonders (especially towards the 1980-1990 generations who are the mostly reminiscent of the 8-bit video games era), and has conjured up a magical and colorful world with our anti-hero, Wreck-it Ralph, a villain in his game arcade pining for the penthouse life and admiration which belongs to the customary hero (Fix-it Felix). Then the storyline meanders into a default hiccup when Ralph is devoted to grab a medal to alter his villainous destiny, which for me is a bit befuddling (perhaps due to my void of background information) and stands as the low point of the film (for me at least), nevertheless, when the chief setting alters to the saccharine Sugar Rush, the film also speeds up by introducing our anti-heroine, Vanellope, a girl glitch in the game's system, who has her heart set on winning the race car competition and becoming a regular member of the game. A natural bond between these two unorthodox characters has slowly connected, with some unexpected twist in the plot (which is supposedly looming during the mid-time but executed with a quite cogent measurement). Friendship has to be tested, and a final battle is in the offing, a foreshadowing Alien-esque invasion looks like a proper payoff. The sidekicks are a tad less interesting compared with Disney's other ventures (and don't be deluded by the poster, most of the fringe characters on it have only cameos in the film) notwithstanding, the great technique of the picture (the 3D effects are also aptly conducted, at least I didn't feel giddy this time) and a not-too-star-studded but pleasantly ear-friendly voice cast should be felicitous compensations (I had put my high hope in Jane Lynch but the high point must be granted to Sarah Silverman). Thus, seriously it is a potent contender for the BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM.p.s.: there was an opening 7-minutes black and white animation short PAPERMAN (2012, 8/10) by John Kahrs which is also an exquisite treat for its romantic context.",7,1,2,18 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Bridesmaids
","As raunchy as any female flick could bear, BRIDESMAIDS is not just a female version of THE HANGOVER spin-off. It hinges firmly on a 3S lady's (single, seventies and stuck) personal mire, and elaborates a watchable diagram of friendship and, eventually a tad of love. The film manages a tug-of-war competition between our protagonist Annie Walker as her childhood BFF Lillian's maid of honor and an almost immaculate bridesmaid Helen (a new friend of Lillian) to the coronet of the best friend of the bride, the battle is inequitably brutal since Helen's filthy rich and such a phony, thus soon it plummets into a steep plight for Annie. However a fairly anticipated buck-up is congenially under the way, so no more melodrama and a woman's victory is all well-deserved. The film is a tailor-made vehicle for Kristine Wiig (who co-writes the script) and her comedic bent has grabbed the best platform to bloom and it is an awesome job! The hysterical turmoil of her life is surprisingly conceived with humor and self-mockery. Among the sidekicks Melissa McCathy is another feat on screen, her embodiment of life with her own weight is the best part in the film and expunges extensively the side effect of a hackneyed plot contrivance. Also Wiig's Saturday NIGHT LIVE co-star Maya Rudolph and an inscrutably dulcet Rose Byrne are adeptly cast. The great news is that the film has become the highest grossing R-rated female comedy of all time in USA, while a sad thing is that it is Jill Clayburgh's final film. It is also another triumph for the producer Judd Apatow (after the tepid welcome of FUNNY PEOPLE 2009), he is still able to pioneer the red-hot craze for the modern-day comedy and be innovative, I hope BRIDESMAIDS 2 will not be a disheartening cool-down as THE HANGOVER PART II (2011) did.",7,0,2,31 January 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","A plain 2D version at the local multiplex, culminating my not-so-frenetic film-viewing activity of 2012. The first chapter of this contentiously extended THE HOBBIT trilogy from Peter Jackson revisits the familiar ground in New Zealand, with Bilbo recounts his tall-tale with Gandolf and thirteen dwarfs (strangely their purpose of their journey seems to be deliberately dodged, for viewers who have not read the novel, the journey itself is conspicuously 'unexpected and unexplained'). In light of my growing fondness towards THE LORD OF THE RING trilogy, I had my wishful thinking that this film could kick off with a competent start, which would be a pipe dream to eclipse THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001, 9/10), but at least to re-ignite certain amount of evocation of the land once brought us amazement and awe. And on this ground, the film has indeed only fulfilled its primary undertaking with its breathtaking skirmishes with trolls, goblins, orcs and other monsters (dragons excluded though), but fails to spike any refreshing ingredient into that wonderland. Peter Jackson has to stuff the less-epic expedition with viable accessories to slide smoothly in its almost 160 minutes length (which may further spark the profit-seeking rapacity behind the trilogy contrivance whose plausible excuse has never been elucidated otherwise). The competence of the renowned-and-much-anticipated CGI technology and the innovative 48fps HFR (High Frame Rate) terminology surprisingly backfires quite harshly due to the diminishing ramifications of the epic sensation which audience demand fervently and preferably upon the franchise. The film is a re-run of forming the pack, with elves intervening, but the best part has to be the Golem vignette (which might sadly insinuate that Golem is Peter Jackson's career apex and barrier ahead), so melancholically deployed to summon all the empathy from THE LORD OF THE RING TRILOGY followers.The massive cast comprises some well-beloved returning immortal figures (McKellen is overpowering while Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee and Elijah Wood's cameos cannot register any thrill) and a young Bilbo (Martin Freeman is shortchanged here since the novel is called THE HOBBIT) with a clutch of dwarfs to be barely discernible to identify their respective names, with Richard Armitage trying desperately to simulate a Viggo Mortensen embodiment. So, under whatever different circumstances in regard of expectation, the film is a jolly cocktail of a series of roller-coaster adventures and a chirpily reminiscent runaway train, anyway its rosy box office shows basically audience are quite merciful during the Christmas season, so let's wish the miracle will continue occurring to Jackson not once, but twice.",6,4,9,16 January 2013
Non-Stop," Neeson's another action flick
","My first cinema-going in Cairo in a rather mini-screen room downtown, my big-screen attendance needs to be revived, but in this arid season, the only credible choice (for me at least) is this Liam Neeson's action flick, very pertinent to the current mystifying tragedy of Malaysian airline's missing Boeing 777-200ER, and not the least because my goddess Moore is in it too, returns the favor to Neeson as a red-herring-and-the-possible-love-interest in it after their largely overlooked collaboration in Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller CHLOE (2009, 7/10), oops, spoilers alert!The premise is smart and efficient enough to pique audience's interest in this airplane-bound whodunit hijacking, Bill Marks (Neeson), an air marshal with alcoholic problem and a heart- rending past, tries to expose the mastermind who extorts $150 million to an account abroad by claiming to kill one fuselage-confined passenger (or crew member) every 20 minutes inside a transatlantic vehicle. What is more insidious, the plot is divulged to frame Marks as the fall guy, and with some inexplicable twists and three body counts, it almost works.But no one should pick on Liam Neeson, overtly the most bankable action star over-60 presently (TAKEN 2008, 7/10; THE GREY 2011, 7/10; TAKEN 2 2012, 5/10), take that Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis! Reunited with Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of UNKNOWN (2011), he is forlorn and desperate to outstrip his unidentified enemy, but he will catch the culprit under any circumstances. So we all embark on the shot in the dark with Bill, deducing by appearance, physiognomy, utterance and of course, ethnics, but the film firmly sticks to the political correctness. The message communication between Marks and the unknown terrorist who hacks the specialized network inside the aircraft plays a major part in conveying information essential to audience's own judgment and slickly props up the storytelling along the riddle until a time-bomb is uncovered. Then one negligent boo-boo will betray who is the extorter. It is a challenging task to round up such an original scheme and offer a satisfactory explanation, so the finishing-up process is cursorily executed (especially the motive and the preposterous set pieces involving several key characters' conduct), it is understandable but the thirsty of a plausible closure has never been properly quenched, maybe they are working on a sequel due to its rosy box office achievements, hope Moore's role can be excavated (from the huge scar on her chest) much deeper since she could be the big boss behind all the catastrophe. Neeson is formidable and vulnerable alternately, he certainly enjoys the exploitation of the typecast lone-hero fashion, but one does hope he can return to his character-actor realm during the breaks, he is much overdue for some serious recognition besides these cash consolation after the ski tragedy killed his wife Natasha Richardson. The rest of the cast is borderline passable, glad to see Dockery manage to grab a decent role on big screen out of her DOWNTON ABBEY property. But Nyong'o doesn't need this on her filmography at all, I will not spoil too much, nevertheless a big relief for me is that she survives instead of being written off hastily with her Grace Jones hairstyling.",5,0,2,18 March 2014
Man on the Moon," Carrey's best performance so far
","I enter the film while being literally oblivious of who is Andy Kaufman, as far as I know, the film is mostly famed because it hitherto has been Jim Carrey's most Oscar-worthy performance, yet being blatantly snubbed again after his drama venture in Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998, 8/10). So in my case, the film is a dedicative portrait of an eccentric entertainer whose ideology of performance is all about entertaining himself and treat his audience as a receptacle of his sensational idiosyncrasy and excruciatingly manipulative fabrications disguised as parody or mockery. Yet, during his short life-span (Andy passed away in 1984 at the age of 35), this methodology makes him a unique figure in the canvas of American comedians (although he would never condescend himself as a 'comedian').Apart from his best remembered role as Latka Gravas in ABC's sitcom TAXI (1978-1982), Andy's strikingly unorthodox gambits include the Foreign Man persona, Might Mouse lip- syncing, and singularly his alter-ego Tony Clifton, an audience-abusing lounge singer with off-key boorishness, all farcically re-enacted by the-one-and-only Jim Carrey, more hinges on visual gags than fusillading well-conceived punchlines, he vigorously pulls off a studious impersonation rather than reveling in his usual elastic facial stunts, in a way, Andy is much more closer to a performance artist than a funny man, staging appealing sensations to exploiting genuine emotions from audience, his motto is to always stay distinctively in advance of your audience, instead of pandering, he surprises them, especially in a provocative way (e.g. the inter-sexual wrestling sham), Carrey nails his psychology to the marrow in his transcendent effort. The rest of the cast is playing it safe around him mainly because most of the prototypes are still alive (some of them make cameos and others are simply playing themselves in a not-so-faraway time-frame), DeVito and Giamatti take a lion's share of their screen-time in comically constructing a layer of authenticity as Andy's agent George Shapiro and his creative parter Bob Zmuda, whereas Courtney Love is Lynne, Andy's romantic interest, instead, submerges herself as a subtler spectator to offer gravitas when the film needs in the second half as the ultimate death is looming large. Surely it is also a refreshing maneuver to start the film with sheer Black & White sequences of Andy breaking-the-four-wall and kidding about this picture with his comical bent. The two-times Academy winning director Milo¬ö Forman steadily segues one skit after another, confidently concocts a mesmerizing montages of Andy's career highlights, and maintains an enigmatic aura of Andy's personal facet, in the final scenes, when an Andy impostor performs Gloria Gaynor's I WILL SURVIVE as Tony Clifton, at one time, we are all being tricked into believe the real Andy is still breathing the same air of ours, then the frame majestically pans through Lynne, George and Bob, suggests otherwise without unmasking the subject, such a class act ending. Despite that some of the farces are too pass√© to appreciate nowadays, the film doesn't feel far-fetched in its nitty-gritty and it does arouse some stinging thoughts about how we perceive to be entertained from the showbiz, if only Andy could have lived longer to stand the test of time, is he a true legend in modulating the general taste of the mass or a shooting-star cannot prevent his ego from wearing out his routine antics.",8,5,6,26 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson is going strong!
","Wes Anderson has been steadfastly honing his finesse since the outset of his career starting from BOTTLE ROCKET (1996) when he was only 27, from then, this wunderkind's filmography has flourished healthily, presently he is among the most successful auteur in US indie ground and internationally his fame also balloons with his audience, his eighth feature THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, this year Berlin International Film Festival's opening film (and Grand Jury Prize winner) and a genuine box-office triumph, indicates he is not slowing down in any aspect. Distinctively utilising 3 aspect ratios for three different time-lines, the predominant storyline in the 30s is in the standard academy ratio, Anderson marshals a bevy of distinguished actors to offer his die-hard devotees a resplendent banquet inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. In a fictional Republic of Zubrowska, located in middle Europe's alpine state, there is the titular hotel, on the cusp of WWII, the concierge Gustave H (Fiennes) and the lobby boy Zero (Revolori) experience a sm√∂rg√•sbord of incidents fluctuate from an inheritance tumult to a painting theft and to wacky murder cases, from an off-the-wall prison break to a catch-and-chase escapade in a snowfield and finally to a vis-a-vis confrontation in the hotel, it is as kooky as one could ever anticipate in a fashion of Anderson's childlike sophistication, at the same time, the narrative unwinds with absorbing √©lan in the same class as in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012, 8/10). Anderson's one-of-a-kind varicolored miniatures, opulent design and ingenious compositions again leave his audience in a state of awe and elation, although frequently his back screen projections let the cat out of the reality bag, which vastly has the hallmarks of the standard Hollywood productions, a studio setting grafts on an unconvincing outdoor background. Fiennes is superbly foppish and demonstrates a dynamic interplay with the wide-eyed neophyte Revolori. The pair's friendship is alternately self-consciously comical and heroically heartfelt, Fiennes knows perfectly the timing to deliver his sermon under diverse circumstances, as a dowager-charmer, his lovable goofiness trumps any moral judgment simply because everybody deserves to be happy. Among the massive supporting group, F. Murray Abraham deserves more credits for his compassionate hospitality as the elder Zero in the 1960s and the impassioned narrator (nevertheless how come an Indian boy has metamorphosed into an Arabian grown-up is beyond any explanation); Tilda Swinton is strikingly overshadowed by her old-age make-up although she is always a scene-stealer (even when her character is dead); Saoirse Ronan plays Agatha, the love-interest of Zero, an apprentice of the Mendel bakery who has a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her face, she a plucky girl with a sense of righteousness, a symbol of virtue which falls victim of the impending war; last but not the least, Willem Dafoe spices up his menacing goon with equally-dosed grimness and caricature. Principally Anderson underlays a tale of woe with sufficient verve and vibrant palette, more incredibly, he is perfecting his story-telling technique, as a whole, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is his most mature film to date and rosily beckons that the zenith of Wes Anderson school is manifestly on the horizon now.",8,4,9,1 July 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
","A career comeback for an over-the-pinnacle mega-star is always gladly received (haters excluded) as it contains somewhat palatable subtext that the precious second chance will eventually arrive (good luck Eddie Murphy! Or maybe Meg Ryan?).This latest Mission: Impossible vehicle is an utter treat for the eyes, especially for the IMAX screen audience, I watched it in front of a regular-sized one, still it is as diverting as any action/adventure film could ever proffer! All the locales are prudently chosen, Moscow with the part of a concealingly disguised Prague, Dubai and Mumbai are the three main settings, with all the action sequences come visually gratifying and sometimes eyes-opening (the Burj Khalifa Tower scenes in the trailer alone is tempting enough and the actual outcome is more stunning and breathtaking), prompt quips and one-liners in-between are effectual and measuredly conjured (Simon Pegg is the capital scene-stealer, and the new protagonist of a fourth Bourne feature, Jeremy Renner, also register quite amusing deadpan rib-tickling moments here, the new female agent Paula Patton is a delight too).The nucleus of Mission: Impossible brand could be recapitulated as one sentence: everything is possible as long as one's imagination can reach, which has been steadfastly proved again by the plot of a last-second foiled nuclear missile. But generally speaking, the storyline is yet willfully implausible, which is a hot potato thornier than any special effects hiccups for the overall action genre. A more sensible remark should be that it is the film itself rescues Tom Cruise's descending career, and apart from the stunt-free acrobatics outside the highest building in the world, Cruise hardly renders anything new in his veteran character, Ethan Hunt.",8,3,7,21 December 2011
Foxcatcher," Why no buzz for Tatum, he is great in FOXCATCHER!
","Another this year's Oscar hopeful right before the Oscar night (although up to this moment, it is more likely to be an also-ran in all its 5 nominated categories), Bennett Miller tackles another sport after MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), his similarly-fated Oscar players. This time it is about wrestling,FOXCATCHER recounts the infamous USA murder case of DavidSchultz (Ruffalo), an Olympic wrestling champion, shot dead by the billionaire John Du Pont (Carell with a fake nose and aged make-up), who started the Team Foxcatcher to sponsor and train national wrestling team for the Olympics, where David was the assistant coach of the team. Actually the main story here is about David's younger brother, Mark Schultz (Tatum), also an Olympic champion in 1984, who is firstly recruited by John in 1987 as the promising athlete aiming for gold in the upcoming Olympic Games in Seoul, they form a twisted coach-and- trainee relationship (which reminiscent of this year's another Oscar contender WHIPLASH 2014, 9/10) with a pungent insinuation on latent homosexuality (don't tell me the scenes where a half-naked Mark shaving for John is a common picture in straight men's fraternities), while Mark is an impressionable youngster who is exalted to find the like- mindedness and camaraderie with the richest man in American (he is an Olympic champion who is failed to be honored by his country); it is John Du Pont, who is a damaged good inside despite of all his superior facades, he is not a professional coach, just a super-rich dilettante bearing an unquenchable passion for wrestling, also he is often under the influence of his feeble but noble mother (a sterling cameo by the venerable Redgrave), who dismisses his passion-of-life as being 'low' (as opposite of hers, raising horses). Miller overtly suggests right after that humiliation, John impulsively vents his rage on Mark and called him an ingrate ape, which ignites the fuse of their ultimate falling-out, things further deteriorate when John finally employs David in his team (a belated move as it will turn out that David is the right coach for Mark), but at that moment, their relation turns sour since it is John who previously encourages him to get out of the shadow of his brother, so Mark feels alienated and belittled, he builds the tension both with John and David, finally he fails in the competition and is dropped out of the team soon afterward.It has always been a mystery of John's motivation to murder David, and Miller as always, doesn't opt to spoon-feed his audience with a clear answer, or dramatize the sensation to be impressive, only leaves his clues among his muted-palette frames with undivided aplomb. So my take is that the murder is John's revenge to his failed liaison with Mark, in his mind, everything goes awry after David arrives, and he is too blind to realize that he is actually the culprit who causes the fiasco, he becomes paranoid and believes that David is behind all this, and should pay for the consequences, thus, in a word, John is an delusional lunatic, doesn't deserve any sympathy or redemption, an expensive price to pay to being that rich. Carrell elevates himself into the elite club of an comedian-turned-Oscar-nominee (Jim Carrey should cry in his bathroom) thanks to such a hyped physical transformation, he is quite impressive to deliver the unnerving vibe which always hides underneath his condescending pompousness, adeptly mocks a self-claimed patriot who has a distorted soul inside without inducing any untimely comic effect, this man is a serious thespian! His fellow Oscar nominee, Ruffalo, is pitch-perfect too, who can be more sympathetic as a loving brother and an eventual victim played by the unassuming Mr. Ruffalo? One highlight is the grapple with Tatum near the beginning, both display tremendous corporeal endeavor to prepare their roles as wrestling pros, meanwhile Miller and his DP Greig Fraser capture the unspoken tension brilliantly which even makes a wrestling layman like myself feeling captivated. However, to be perfectly frank, Tatum is the one who gives a more admirable performance and a more accomplished character building, although Mark is dumbed down as a walking ape without any sophisticated depth in his mind, quite 'a canary in a coal mine', a measurement of how volatile John Du Pont is, Tatum comes off as a riveting presence from the beginning when he is ill-treated by the society, being socially awkward, seething with spleen and dissatisfaction; with his protruding jaw (more noticeably in his profile) and the chunky unwieldiness, he certainly goes out on a limb to defy all his previous screen charisma to impersonate a character not entirely up his alley, and this is so-called 'a breakthrough performance' any young actor aspires to prove to his audience. MONEYBALL may not grow on me, but FOXCATCHER can easily boost up my confidence towards Miller, after his stunning (non-documentary) feature debut CAPOTE (2005, 9/10), if he can keep working on tantalizing material like this, soon he will find his own keystone as a cinematic auteur with his own fingerprint of handling dark elements with distinguished composure and patience.",8,2,4,22 February 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence of Arabia
","A first-time viewing of this David Lean's internationally renowned masterpiece in a KVIFF grand-screening this year, which is an unforgettable 222 minutes of revelry for a film aficionado. Technically speaking, this epic film is flawless, who would not be appalled and intoxicated by the picturesque shots of the desert, and amazed by the strenuous effort from the monolith teamwork to produce such a magnificent celluloid-biography.Peter O'Toole has set such insurmountable brio for his fame-entry performance as T.E. Lawrence, a contentious figure as the messiah of the Arabic country, therefore, a condescending stance also cannot be sidestepped whenever dealing with this race-sensitive issues, an ad hoc situation for this film, a British hero among Arabian peoples is more or less difficult to pander to both parts, besides the sizable veneration towards the original book, Lean has an artistic etiquette to take advantage of phenomenal visual thrusts to proffer a universally soul-stirring magnetism, to which everyone could be warmed regardless of age, cultural background and race. The matin√©e idol-studded supporting group also emits indestructible prowess to cement the compelling story, my only dissent is Alec Guinness should have topped Omar Sharif (who was co-nominated with O'Toole in the Oscar race) for the honor, although Omar's rendition is a very satisfying one. Quinn, Hawkins, Quayle, Rains and Kennedy, such a sumptuous lineup, even Jos√© Ferrer's Turkish warlord cameo is inexplicable charming and deadly dangerous. The gay undertones are flowing in a minute and downbeat passage but one could sense the utterly woman-free idiosyncrasy might insinuate much more than just being set against a military and Arabic milieu. If one must pick the underbelly, in my opinion the action sequences might not be Lean's strongest suit, e.g. the war battle slaughter is quite merciful and riotous in an artificial angle, albeit there were authentic and elephantine menfolks being deployed, but in an era without the now-overabundant CGI technology, this 7 Oscar-winning film (including BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR) is not only the hallmark of Lean's career, but the entire golden Hollywood as well.",9,0,2,24 July 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," a farrago of state-of-the-art rescue-and-fighting rough-and-tumble in its most kaleidoscopic register
","To commemorate the tenth anniversary of MCU, spearheaded by IRON MAN (2008), the third Avengers assembly vehemently pushes the envelop of the superhero mishmash, now has a plethora of roll call at the creators' disposal, and bang!, it puts half of the entire universe's population at the risk of perdition if the mega-villain Thanos (Brolin under heavy CGI reconstruction) successfully collects all six Infinity Stones (Power, Space, Reality, Soul, Time, Mind) in his gauntlet. Apparetly this chapter boasts a series of all-out pitched battles across the galaxy as the fans know it, and marshals stimulating pairing-ups (Iron Man, Spidey mingling with Doctor Strange, Thor saved by Guardians of the Galaxy quintet, and the rest are united in Wakanda) through its non-stop action escapades, whether it is on spaceships, Earth, or other forbidding-looking planets, with a teleporting Thanos always getting what he wants (and rubbing out several peripheral characters offhand), whereas the Avengers can only savor a triumphant tang by eliminating his quartet of minions, aka. Children of Thanos (including Carrie Coon's Proxima Midnight) together with innumerable and ferocious cannon fodders.The stakes are extremely high, and what lends Thanos an upper-hand to lay his hands on the stones is his hellbent resolution, even if it means to sacrifice someone he loves, a crescendo reaches in the midpoint when the irony of Thanos' loveless temperament suddenly altered by his ostensible crocodile's tears, which reveals his most profound feelings under a villain's pedestrian merciless carapace, and believe it or not, it actually grants him legitimacy to attain the Soul Stone, at that point, one can sense the premonition that nothing can stop him. Yet, the writers offers one fat chance to subdue him in the epic battle executed by the pageantry of teamwork on the planet of Titan, only backfires in the hands of Star-Lord (Pratt), owing to his irrational rage of some very bad tidings, well, a one-stone-two-birds coincidence couldn't be more expeditious.It is sensible to lay down the final battle on the tiny globe called Earth for earthlings' geocentric pride, and in Wakanda no less, riding on the coattail of BLACK PANTHER's phenomenal popularity. After another much-tarried sacrifice seemingly scuttles Thanos' plan in the Avengers' collective, last-ditch bravado, however, in possession of the Time Stone (Doctor Strange, this one is on your relented sentimentality), Thanos is able to revert to a previous moment and fulfills his feat with a plaintive cliff-hanger when a selected bunch of our favorite heroes morphs into dust and vanishes into thin air.  In the mean, INFINITY WAR is a farrago of state-of-the-art rescue-and-fighting rough-and-tumble in its most kaleidoscopic register, punctuated by amusing one-liners and japes notwithstanding (Drax the Destroyer should be re-coined as the Prankster), and astutely trades on audience's accumulative investment of its bloated dramatis personae, prepares us a bottoming-out scenario for the more rousing turnaround in its upcoming next installment. Most major characters are understandably shortchanged due to its enterprising scale, Thor (Hemsworth) arguably gets the most boost by a new eye-ball and a freshly wrought storm-breaker axe, and Gamora (Saldana), predicated on a closer relation with Thanos, is allowed a more heart-felt passage to finish her own precarious journey, elsewhere, INFINITY WAR doesn't outdo a common MCU audience's moderate expectation, but a solid job is something of a merit at this step, although one might detect a trace of too-big-to-fail conceit might stymie any further bold maneuver in this most lucrative cinematic universe that has been entertaining an overpopulated planet for a decade and now orbits right into its red-hot heyday.",7,1,2,6 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's 35mm eulogy of a bygone era in the Tinseltown
","Quentin Tarantino's 9th feature film, ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD headlines two biggest current Hollywood matinee stars for their first collaboration, DiCaprio plays a washed-up actor Rick Dalton and Pitt is his former stunt double and current chauffeur, Cliff Booth, in the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Age and the year is 1969, also notoriously for the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate (1943-69), Roman Polanski's pregnant wife, and her friends.By drawing on his facility of slasher to tackle the real-life grisly tragedy, Tarantino cunningly promises his votaries a bloodbath that prowls like the elephant in the room with its looming premonition (not least the final countdown of that ghastly night), which is unexpectedly deflected into a brutal house invasion where the preordained positions of victims and victimizers are ingeniously swapped, and comes off far...continue reading my review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8,7,20,19 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Behind the Candelabra
","Steven Soderbergh's tentative final film is a biography of Liberace, with the cast of Michael Douglas (his post-cancer comeback) and Matt Damon, it still fails to secure a cinema release in USA, which comes across as a bummer since after BROKENBACK MOUNTAIN (2005, 10/10) and MILK (2008, 8/10), in the mainstream media, gay films haven't yet progressed much thanks to the conservative top brass in the Hollywood. Anyway, trends will change eventually, nothing can stop it, USA made a great advancement several days ago and the rest of the world will follow. Michael Douglas stuns with his effeminate mimicry (on stage is the lilting rendition) in the film as the world-known pianist, a flamboyant closeted-man, a selfish control-freak obsesses with his complexion and his tabloid news, but he is also a genius player, an apt entertainer, although the taste he denotes is tawdry and grandiose, he is a nouveau-riche would make the rest of the world grudge. Though hobbled by my ignorance of Liberace, Douglas' incarnation is a self- challenging ambition and now an Emmy award is low-hanging fruit for him, and the make-up team too is awesome, both the face-lifting and AIDS-afflicting guises are eyeball-grabbing. Matt Damon is his Adonis baby-boy Scott Thorson, albeit both him and Douglas are two- decades older than their characters in real age, it is a long-delayed meaty role for Matt, in lieu of the film is based on Scott's own version of the story, he hogs an ever longer screen time than Liberace, one might find him in lack of a sense of queerness in his rough-edginess (by comparison, Boyd Holbrock is more accurate in presenting his allure as another young flesh for Liberace), but the choice itself flouts the stereotype, and Damon runs the gamut of emotions from a naive boy falls for an elder man to a meds-addicted fop cannot get over with his philandering significant other, his best performance so far! Two highlights from the supporting group, Rob Lowe, whose face undergoes an extreme elevation, plays deadpan humor at its best as the plastic surgeon; the legendary Debbie Reynolds, also stands out as Liberace's mother whose exotic accent and childish playfulness leave a strong impression from her brief stint in the film. Out of my wayward obstinacy, I put Damon ahead of Douglas regarding the performance, but the film is a well-orchestrated drama, Soderbergh steers clear of any offshoots and centers on the troubled relationship which is tedious but typical in a mundane world. We sneer it on the screen whilst in reality we tread the same water again and again.",7,2,4,29 June 2013
Gone Girl," sterling work from Fincher, again!
","GONE GIRL finally arrives in the cinema here, so what could be more appropriate than Fincher's vastly anticipated and razor-sharp dissection of modern marriage/relationship for a Halloween night? The aftermath of this trend-setting thriller can impact abidingly on one's memory not only for its plot twist but also a brave ending which dares to defy the accepted mode of 'perpetrator gets punished in the end', and intrigues viewers to inspect our own quotidian bearings and give an inscrutable glimpse to our partner. Nick Dunne (Affleck) is the husband, a seemingly attractive guy, a professor in the college and not particularly ambitious, ordinary to say the most, but deep down he is a major disappointment to his wife Amy, who is a bestseller writer of THE AMAZING AMY series, they ditched their posh life in NYC to Missouri, to take care of Nick's cancer-ridden mother, but after she passed away, they are also stranded there, like their marriage and their financial situation.In order to set up the false appearance of being murdered by her husband on their anniversary with the six-week pregnancy, Amy starts her meticulous scheming to start afresh at the expense of Nick's doom. Once we know the plan (which is surprisingly disclosed in the midstream), her outright malignancy is appalling, although Nick's good husband facade has dissolved quite conveniently for adultery and emotional detachment, but this qualifies for a death penalty. The second half kick-starts a dual storyline which out-paces the normal police procedural, in one hand, Nick is fried by media and police, lead by detective Rhonda (Dickens), to get rid of his suspicion, aided by his twin sister Margo (Coon) and a well-known lawyer Tanner Bolt (Perry), he realizes what Amy has done to frame him. In a game-changing crunch, Nick puts on his best performance to be the one Amy always wants him to be in a talk-show to easily win back the trust of populace (the satire is brilliantly on the nose!), also the belated admiration of Amy, now as a spectator in front of the TV. In the other hand, Amy's post-crime story is also tortuous and remarkably startling, to disguise herself from being recognized, she gains some weight, wears shabby clothes with self-inflicted bruise on the face, maintains in a low-profile life but one small hiccup leads to the quandary of being penniless, but the amazing Amy will not give up, resorts to her ex-bf, Desi Collings (Harris), she is hidden in his posh lake house under surveillance, it seems to be a perfect place for Amy to stay with a man who is unconditionally obsessed with her. Just one thing, Desi is a control freak, and so is Amy, who cannot allow herself deprived of the power of command, Desi must be dispatched and in the arresting third act, Amy returns as a victim kidnapped by Desi, Amy and Nick becomes the most likable couple thanks to the media frenzy, and both agree to keep up the appearance after Amy comes clean to him about what she has done. The coda touches on a tangible thrill of distrust and creepiness, Nick decides to stay in the marriage and ignores the elephant in the room.Affleck's often lukewarm body language and in lack of facial expressions gives Nick the authenticity of being indolent and insensitive, Fincher brings out his best performance, he is dampening down all the trappings of being a man of intelligence, but in the key scenes when he is elicited to talk to Amy on the national TV, he knows he enjoys the game, and he is good at the game too, from then on, he turns from a victim to a matchable gamer, which also attributes to Amy's decision to come back. Pike is the film's overt MVP, finally grabs a meaty career-defining role and a leading lady status more than 10 years after her big screen debut in 007's DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002, 5/10), the role also demands a transformation of her appearance, but her versatility between an icy queen and a threatening psychopath is the actual calling card for her very first Oscar nomination, and it is a much more complicated and deadly villain than her Oscar precedents such as Kathy Bates in MISERY (1990, 8/10) or Louise Fletcher in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975, 8/10). She is mysteriously dangerous because she could appear nearer than one can imagine. The rest of the cast is all bells and whistles, only Carrie Coon (from THE LEFTOVER series) may have a shot for an Oscar nomination thanks to the tacit closeness between her and Affleck (they are twins in the film albeit a 9-year-old age discrepancy), plus the film is a major topical movie right now, if the momentum stays, she can sneak in the race; the same cannot be said to Kim Dickens, this very underrated character actress is also remarkable as the tough detective, but she is wanting an Oscar-inviting showpiece to solidify her qualification. Fincher is red-hot now and it is respectable he doesn't pander for some Academy-friendly material to secure his trophy, instead, he keeps making films of his gusto with astonishing precision, and I cannot wait to watch this film again, in DVD or BluRay for sure, because in Egypt, the censorship has cut all the sex and gory scenes, which for a purist as myself, it is utterly frustrating.",8,0,6,2 November 2014
Django Unchained," Django Unchained
","My first cinema-going in 2013 is dedicating to Tarantino's DJANGO UNCHAINED, a Spaghetti-Western spoof colored with slavery exploitation, but with his usual stellar cast, talkative banters, pulp violence, it is an excellent body of work with mash-up entertainment, which safely to say, Quentin's staunch fan-boys will not be disappointed, while new blood may also be introduced since it has already been Quentin's top-grossing film in the North American continent, driven by its 5 Oscar-nominations momentum like INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009, 8/10) three years ago (which actually procured a more impressive 8 nominations including BEST DIRECTOR), the international territory will soon be conquered without any doubt. There are tons of laughters can be elicited during the lengthy 165 minutes, propelled by 3 great supporting performances, the hero Django has been outclassed for most of the time, a belated slaughter outburst only arrives in the last 15 minute. Christoph Waltz's German bounty hunter has a joyous gloss with droll quips which is a far cry from his Oscar- winning role in INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, but deliciously refreshing. On the second half, when Leonardo DiCaprio's plantation owner shows up, he outshines the rest of the group (even Waltz, maybe not Mr. Jackson) in his accurate Southern accent and infuses his wicked mien and charm with pitch-perfect showmanship, it is a daring attempt, and I must say I am very impressed. Last but not the least of the three musketeers, Samuel L. Jackson has eventually regained his ginger in another Quentin's vehicle, his vicious stare sets a heinously creepy tone from his very first scene, and juggles with a minion's subservience to mask his man-behind-the-curtain mastery. It is an ace in the hole to designate a black boss to circumvent all the presumed racist's accusation around slavery, Quentin Tarantino is a virtuoso screen-writer and a story-concocter. Jamie Foxx has gained his best leading role since his Oscar-crowning RAY (2004, 8/10), although most of time he has been subdued into a marginalized sidekick, he and Kelly Washington (who is very underrated not only in this film) does make for a great couple on screen, his Django-spelling scene with Franco Nero (who is the leading man in DJANGO, a 1966 spaghetti by Sergio Corbucci, a film from where Quentin gets his inspiration) is the tribute moment for all the fans. So, as we all know, it is Waltz gets an Oscar nomination, but I firmly support Leonardo this time, and his acting range and personal knack has been tested and emanated to the hilt through years of versatile roles, I question when a due Oscar will ever come under his belt, his recent taking-a-long-break-from-acting manifestation may suggest he finally comes to the terms with the disillusion. Digressing back to the film, one can always enjoy a great deal of time in Quentin's cornucopia of vintage refrains and other trendy tunes, when Western meets Rap, the blood must spout stronger! Even violence has been transformed into some sort of comical set pieces when the uplifting melodies are chanting alongside the imminent shootouts. The film is a true Tarantino masterpiece and he always makes it the fullest!",8,0,1,22 January 2013
Get Out," a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting
","An unheralded cash cow in its domestic revenue and also a succ√®s d'estime, USA black comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut GET OUT rides on the coattail of the racial powder keg in the current USA soil, conjures up a well-conceived conspiracy theory married with an aroused scenario taking the leaf from the time-tested suburbia genre book, a close cousin is Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIFES, and enlivens its central story with robust horror tropes pulsating in a bracing beat. Our virile hero is Chris Washington (Kaluuya), a black photographer who is going to meet his white girlfriend Rose Armitage's (Williams) family for the first time. What Chris encounters is not the hostile racism usually presides within uncouth hillbillies or religious-poisoned happy clappies, instead, in this close-knit WASP community, what lurks around is something much more sinister and beyond one's wildest imagination. The overt clue is the aberrant behaviors of the black servants living with the Armitages: the housekeeper Georgina (Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Henderson). At first glance, Peele seems to dangle viewers with a more conventional reference of slavery, but correlating with the film's unsettling prologue of abducting a black man Andrew Hayworth (Stanfield) in the same neighborhood, a sober mind suggests that we cannot take the situation for granted, certainly, something is wrong with the black people on the lot, they are not themselves, but the voodoo in the mix hits more on the mark of deep-rooted illusion of immortality than the ostensible white supremacy, there is a nuanced overtone even eulogizing black race's vitality as the perfect human specimen, meanwhile the main trope vouchsafes what lies beneath is the turpitude of extreme selfishness which deprives others of their identity (brain) for one's own sake, a metaphor of power-abusing from those privileged few, which is part and parcel of the film's runaway success, viewers cannot help but paralleling it with the current political affairs in the Trump era - life can be a sick joke. Artistically speaking, Peele rounds up a coherent (albeit improbable) story arc within its suburbia milieu, an estate is quietly ensconced with quaint Americana, a retro luster contradicts the young couple's modernist urbanity. From that symbolic deer-in-the-headlight accident to the para-psychic hypnosis, to a superbly and literally devised sunken place (evoking the murky other-worldliness in Jonathan Glazer's UNDER THE SKIN 2013), until the mandatory but still engrossing bailing-out killing spree, GET OUT treads circumspectly through the familiar ground without overdosing in the wantonness of its cock and bull story. Credits should fairly given to a capable cast, Daniel Kaluuya makes for a straight-up hero with gaping intensity, and Allison Williams capitalizes in Rose's about-face veracity to a bone-chilling effect. LilRel Howery as Chris' best friend, a TSA officer, stands out as the comic foil and a mouthpiece of inappropriate one-liners, and an openly hearty Bradley Whitford, a beguilingly frosty Catherine Keener and a delirious Caleb Landry Jones, rounds out an unsettling dysfunctional family, last but not the least, Betty Gabriel, arguably leaves the most bizarre impression perfectly in line with the thematic out-of-body creepiness. For all its hype and buzz, GET OUT benefits greatly from its timing and present-day context, plus a genuinely appealing wheeze of identity-swapping. A miracle-maker borne out of an above-average commodity that no one should begrudge for its success, because it excels as a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting, which is dishearteningly wanting in most wide-opening theatrical staples, especially at a dejected time like this.",7,15,28,5 June 2017

","This high-acclaimed black noir of our era has accumulated 'best-of-the-year' momentum ever since it garnered a Best Director honor for the Denmark prodigy Nicolas Winding Refn (from PUSH trilogy and DRIVE is his Hollywood premier) in Cannes last year.The film exudes a drastically visual flare almost in every scene, from its one-of-a-kind camera angle, an utterly mind-blowing hue (a mesmerizing contrast between warm orange and ruthless shadow dark). The whole script is as corny as any hacks could write with eyes shut, a point-of- no-return road for a lone hero to save his beloved woman from danger. So plot wise, the film could be a thorough disaster, and here comes our virtuoso director to rescue the film and without embellishing the content, fully showcasing his theatrical aesthetics to fend off the fatigue of the tedious characterization (a taciturn Ryan Gosling can only be beneficial to his staunchest followers, while a dainty Carey Mulligan has too little to display her faculty), among the cast, if one doesn't harbor a over-hyped expectation, Albert Brooks will be a fierily menacing discovery particularly it is creepily against his usual comedic strain. Subtlety rules, several remarkable shots and tableaux (to wit: the hammer menace in the strip- club's dressing room, the man with a creepy musk in front of the pizzeria before the slaughter with its consequent beach hunt at night and so on) are jaw-droppingly staggering and the violence showcase is harrowingly stylistic, the elevator scene could be on a par with the Gaspar No√©'s groundbreakingly grisly IRREVERSIBLE (2002). The film is going to be a classic cult not the least because of all the Oscar snubs it receives, which is confoundingly a congenial sign of its bright future both for the film itself and Mr. Refn's professional career (the latter is even more uncanny regarding the recent vicious curse upon non-American new directors' debut in Hollywood, Refn and Cary Fukunaga from JANE EYRE 2011 are the only jinx-breakers so far). Ps. the hypnotic soundtrack is the ace, the ending-song COLLEGE'S A REAL HERO is the killing for me.",8,8,13,20 February 2012
Aladdin," a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance
","Disney's live action rehash of its vast animation cannon unabashedly trades on its multiplex time-honored stories as good scripts are few and far between nowadays, it is a canny strategy and has paid great dividends as yet, ALADDIN, its 1992 cel animation feature is an echt corker, boasting a kaleidoscopic Middle-Eastern folktale of substantive visual sumptuosity, not to mention Robin Williams' transcendent voice work as Genie, which, as this reviewer sees it, among one of the most versatile voice-only performances ever.Here, Will Smith exultantly assumes Williams' mantle in this live action, bulks ups and sheathed in all-blue warpaint, he brings down the house when actualizing Genie's multifaceted omnipotence and physical transformation at the drop of a hat, but isn't a patch on Williams for his elocution, Smith's uttering rhythm is conspicuously contemporary and self-conscious (the singing part doesn't do him much good, the reworked FRIEND LIKE ME hardly leaves an impact), shy of a freewheeling drollness that makes William's Genie such a deathless godsend.Directed by Guy Ritchie, literally the last name director one can expect to be tapped into making a family-friendly Disney fare, ALADDIN more or less, hews to the original story, but retrofits a female-empowering upgrade relative to princess Jasmine (a revelatory Naomi Scott), who thumbs her nose at a doofus white-skin suitor (Billy Magnussen, mired in stereotypes and desperately wanting of a breakthrough), belts out the theme song SPEECHLESS with flying colors, and whose glass-ceiling breaking resolve of being a sultan of the desert kingdom Agrabah pays off satisfactorily.By comparison, Mena Massoud's street-smart, diamond-in-the-rough Aladdin has less powerful vocal register (bespoken by their duet of A WHOLE NEW WORLD), but compensates it with rollicking, puppetry-mimicking dancing routines, and whose disarming geniality will eventually grow on the viewers. In the antagonist post, Marwan Kenzari's vile vizier Jafar is cartoonish, but telegraphing a faintly epicene charisma that may pave the way for Disney's more radical act of creating characters of heterodox diversity (a timely move too), meanwhile, pet monkey Abu, parrot Iago (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and the magic carpet, all being convincingly and anthropomorphically reified by the state-of-the-art computer-generated FX undertaking and have their own moments to shine.Totally clicking the box of ethnicity-correctness, buffeting audience with its eye-pleasing 3D spectacles and sleek action bravura, Guy Ritchie's ALADDIN is at any rate, a wondrous crowd-pleaser that merits its Disneyland provenance, however, in terms of rejiggering its original template with a more topical, bolder spin, like its predecessors, Kenneth Branagh's CINDERELLA (2015) and Bill Condon's BEAUTY AND BEAST (2017), it tends to rest on its laurels and is stymied by the fear that any change might affront or displease its core audience, between having the cake and eating it, clearly Disney has made a conservative choice, at this point, not even the upcoming THE LION KING (2019) can alter that, unfortunately.",7,1,3,4 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," love is the theory behind everything, not time, not space, not God, only love
","Personally I have been suffering from a certain degree of biopic fatigue, those annual staples blatantly pandering to academy recognition are often dazzling with Oscar-baity performances, but its narrative structure and skill usually are all laboriously conventional and monotonous. James Marsh's THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is the quintessential archetype of this sort and it is going to give Eddie Redmayne the coveted Oscar for such a taxing mission to imitate Stephen Hawking, the still alive-and-kicking bigwig cosmologist. However, Marsh conducts the film with a fluid pace and it wondrously invigorated by its technical crew, particularly J√≥hann J√≥hannsson's engrossing soundtrack and the ever- pervasive subdued light from lighting department. So, as a result, the film itself is a pretty good biopic, or more specifically, a good (even great) hagiography, since it is adapted from Jane Hawking's autobiography, she is Hawking's first wife and their marriage lasted for 30 years (1965-1995). Hence Jane (Jones) is not just a supportive wife who lives through all the ups-and-downs with Hawking, but completely overshadowed by his achievement and put aside in the corner as we might expect from any standard biopic of great man, instead, Jane is as much in center both in this picture and the un-common relationship as her renowned husband, it is their love story that touches, impresses and melts our hearts, so if you are going to this film harboring a false hope to witness Hawking's extraordinary academic path, you are destined to feel disappointed. On the other hand, the script excruciatingly whitewashes Jane and Stephen's extramarital affairs to offer both a mutual more high ground of looking good, their m√©nage- √†-trois period with sweet widower Jonathan (Cox) is overwhelmingly in rapport, Jane's repressed feelings towards Jonathan never dare to overstep the social boundary, the most explicit indication is Jane's night visit of Jonathan's tent during a camping, then, that is it, it is always a safe card to leave the rest to audience's imagination, as far as the next morning they are not shown together walking out of the same tent, it is safe! As for Stephen's dallying with Elaine (Peake), goes a little bit more explicitly, using Penthouse magazine as the catalyst, but no further familial conflict is presented, the ugly side is well-preserved in the memories of those who are involved firsthand, audience's voyeuristic curiosity again is quenched mercilessly by the tacit agreement of the filmmakers and the insiders. No one should depreciate Redmayne's performance, even for the most sharp-tongued disparager, he is absolutely par excellence, when you grab such a once-in-a-lifetime chance and pull off a role with such sublime verisimilitude and imposing elbow-grease, Oscar is in your pocket, even a revered veteran's belated comeback stunner cannot take it away from you (sorry, Michael Keaton). Felicity Jones, is equally excellent, but without a physical-transformation edge to secure a win and one disadvantage is that she is hampered by the default of a hagiography, there is something emotive wanting. Nevertheless, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a cohesively-orchestrated eulogy of the power of love, love is the theory behind everything, not time, not space, not God, only love, even it has decomposed into a past tense, the feeling of its once authentic presence will still be dauntless enough to encourage us to strive in this world of infinity, that's why we should thank this movie for giving us the blessing.",8,1,1,15 February 2015
Frozen," Disney's keystone in this era!
","A bravura and toasty comeback to the zenith of Disneyland, FROZEN, the freshly BEST ANIMATION PICTURE crowner in the Academy Awards, has already swept the globe with its colossal box-office gross and the ultra-appealing theme song LET IT GO, it also signals the first time for our beloved animation tentpole, a lovey-dovey boilerplate of a princess in the quest for her Prince Charming is preponderated by the bond between princess Anna and her sister, the Ice Queen Elsa, a more broad and wholesome act of true love. Step into the shoes of the cutting-edge sub-brand Pixar, whose BRAVE (2012, 8/10) heralds a trend whereby a female heroine can break the shackles of looking for male suitor as the one and only goal for life. FROZEN goes for a more ambitious yet crucial route to accentuate the courage of embracing yourself as who you are, no matter how different you are from the rest, shut down your heart and lock yourself up in an isolated kingdom is not a way out. Such a valuable message can be widely assimilated among viewers while the roots remain Disney-esque, tuneful and catchy musical numbers with routine delivery, prominent sidekicks fittingly align with the protagonists, like Olaf, the snowman naively thirsts for summer and sunlight, the contribution of Josh Gad's voice cannot go unnoticed. Veteran animator Chris Buck teams up with the first-time director Jennifer Lee, together they construe Hans Christian Andersen's popular fairytale (The Ice Queen) into a visually variegated adventure, minimize the clich√©-ridden flourishes which commonly embellish the leitmotif (no redundant sub-plots to slow down the narrative pace). The story progresses in a wonted and linear approach, yet the whole journey is never in deficiency of enchantment, while the plot is fairly more twisty than Disney's usual fare, a key revelation against the grain can blindside audiences without a hitch. The voice-cast are enjoyable despite that Menzel's voice is overtly too old for Elsa, it is also a plucky move to cast an openly out actor (Groff) to dub the valiant reindeer rider as Anna's genuine soulmate and love-interest, along with the connotation for a more nondiscriminatory society extracted from the pith of its tale, FROZEN is a cinematic hero of our times, a film reaches a much broader demography and transcends its general raison d' √™tre, it may indeed positively refine our world into a more civilized tier and it is no end of virtuous achievements!",8,2,5,5 March 2014
Room," a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation
","A Canada-Irish co-production from Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, the follow-up of his kooky psychodrama FRANK (2014). It wins Brie Larson a coveted Oscar for BEST LEADING ACTRESS, but the real backbone of this bracing indie drama is its 9-year-old child genius Jacob Tremblay.Joy (Larson), is captured by a man she calls Old Nick (Bridgers) 7 years ago, as his sex slave, she is locked inside a room with only a skylight above, and she gives birth to a son named Jack (Tremblay). Now Jack is five years old, he has never been outside the room, and Joy hatches a daring escape plan which puts Jack at the mercy of his luck, but it seems to be their only chance to get out of the living hell.The first hour (before Joy's plan) is entirely shot inside the room, a small shed, Abrahamson has done a phenomenal job to circumvent the claustrophobic setting and elicited an exceptional two- hander between Larson and Tremblay, especially the latter, who is born under such a unique situation, which makes his view of life worlds apart from our common sense and himself a perfect focus point for viewers to scrutinise under the lens of the dramatic sea change soon he is going to experience. Joy's protective strategy works well for a toddler in this extremely unhealthy growing environment (he has to submerge into imagination for companionship, believes everything shown on TV is not real, and the room is their whole world), but when she needs him to assist her in the plan to escape, she must shatter the entire fabrication and tell him what is the real world, here, the clash reaches its boiling point, again, Tremblay is such a godsend to watch, accurately expresses Jack's confusion, denial, fear and maturity from writer Emma Donoghue's taut but rational script.The next hour is less engaging, when Joy and Jack reunite in the outside world, Jack meets his grandmother Nancy (Allen, a fresh welcome to high-quality cinema since she is so overdue for recognition) and grandfather Robert (Macy, a small cameo, but his reunion with Allen as a couple hits the nostalgic sweet spot) for the first time, although they have separated since the missing of Joy, the cognitive knowledge of the real world is a lengthy and time-consuming progress for Jack, but thankfully he has no sequelae of the captivity and it turns out fine for him. It is Joy, who is struggling with depression, anger and guilt, collapses in the real world, Jack becomes her sole strength to overcome her psychological hurdles and there is a brand new life awaits them.ROOM has an all-approaching, soul-touching story at its kernel, burnished with a brilliant cast (the film is unswervingly taking the stance from Jack's viewpoint, which does make Larson's Oscar- winning showcase less reverberating than in SHORT TERM 12, 2013, although Larson's tenacity and mastery of emotions are peerless), and a humble diegetic approach through a child's eye, it adamantly gives rise to a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation, a singular accomplish under the belt of Abrahamson and the sterling teamwork.",8,2,4,24 March 2016
A Quiet Place," a flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever and clever horror-fare dented by its implausible plot device
","A runaway success in the North American box office, actor/director John Krasinski's third feature A QUIET PLACE is a close-knit post-apocalyptical monster horror on the strength of a stimulating prerequisite: what if the tripwire to alert those voracious and blistering predators lurking nearby is not sight but sound? The story is exclusively hinged upon a cloistered nuclear family: husband, wife (Krasinski and his spouse Blunt) and their two surviving children (a daughter, played by the deaf actress Millicent Simmonds and a younger son, the adorable Noah Jupe), after a prologue illogically shows their youngest offspring is snatched by a blink-and-you'll-miss-it creature due to a childish oversight (what kind of parents would let a tot tailing in the rear under that treacherous circumstance?), then, the narrative fast-forwards to one year later, and to spice up the plot, the wife is visibly gravid and instinctively we can presage that her pending delivery will be a helluva encounter with disaster, but it also prompts us to question the counterfactual decision in the first place, why they want another pregnancy (of course we can empathize that it is a grief-assuaging strategy, which comes off so harebrained in its timing) when the couple both knows a new-born baby will most likely put the entire family in the risk of ruination, not to mention the Sisyphean job of smothering every possible noise made by a baby in his nascent years, or simply lock him up inside a sound-proof basement as long as they can? It also underlines that the parents are too self-centered and reckless to bear in mind of the probable danger inflicted to their other two kids, a script-smith is terribly needed, for instance, if the pregnancy could take place before the prologue, it would be more plausible. Enough of this critic's persnickety grouse about its (seemingly unintentional) natalistic infelicity, because in essence, the film is a tautly configured, meticulously calculated genre fare (although that self-evident shush gesture is manifested in excess), and fortunately doesn't squander its innovative premise, silence has never been wielded in such lengths to induce thrills and spills (the wife's bathtub ordeal and the sibling's grain silo narrow escape are gratifyingly entrancing), and jump-scares are particularly modulated within an acceptable extent although the nerve-racking prospect of a spiky nail facing upwards is painfully hackneyed. The epiphany, aka, the weakness of those sightless monsters, is teased out in a gradual realization that doesn't necessarily jump the shark when it transpires, also it astutely adheres to that timeless irony, there is just one thin fine line between one's strongest suite and one's Achille's heel.The quartet cast is optimum, Blunt is most impressive when she is left alone with menace looming over in propinquity whereas Krasinski proves to be a capable hand both behind and in front of the camera, plus Jupe is such an extraordinarily natural player for his tender age, however, the standout by my lights is the gutsy Millicent Simmonds, who makes great play of her gnawing conflict with guilt, resentment and disconsolation, and ultimately, her evolution into the linchpin which once-and-for-all, turns their misery into an incredible triumph is the most heartening takeaway from this flash-in-a-pan lucre-overachiever.",7,4,7,14 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," The Bourne Legacy
","After a five-year stint, BOURNE redux (the fourth chapter) has returned with a pristine cast starring a red-hot Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another secret agent going rogue (not Matt Damon's Jason Bourne), which I just watched in the cinema, from the original trilogy's screenwriter Tony Gilroy, this project is his third director job after MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007, 8/10) and DUPLICITY (2009, 7/10), although it fails to supersede Damon's version, but no one should conceived that situation at the first place, fairly speaking the re-ignition has a diverting start.Running around 135 minutes, the film begins with a faint slow start, with a transition from Bourne to Cross, the intricate sub-plot is Gilroy's trump card, there are variable characters coming and going in the first half part (lots of cameos from the old trilogy), leading the way is new bureaucracy antagonist Edward Norton with his ultra-hectic staffs, then interweaving with another sideline context o the secret bio-lab where Rachel Weisz is residing;meanwhile Cross is trapped in the middle of nowhere in the snow land, fighting against wolf packs (a homage to the ending of THE GREY 2012, 7/10?), evading and sabotaging pilotless cruise missile. So obviously Gilroy skimps on the action sequences for the rest half of the film. The lab- slaughter intensity is masterfully done compared with other showboating maneuvers (forcefully put a tracker inside a CGI wolf), which may not be proper to American's vulnerable nerves since the authenticity is strikingly nerve-racking. After that the next highlight is our hero saving the girl set piece, thanks to a more-than-average cast, this part is also neatly and gratifyingly exercised. The final culmination is set in Manila and it is a roller coaster rider without brakes, but a precipitate ending on the picturesque tropical sea may feel a shade less considerate, although one could expect it as it dares not stretch out of the average length of the cinema-goers' habit like THE DARK KNIGHT RISE (2012, 8/10) fearlessly did. Truthfully speaking, I hold no grudge with the reboot, and actually I prefer Renner's chattiness to Damon's woodenness. One wishful thinking, don't kill off Weisz's role in the next one like what they did to Franka Potente in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004, 7/10), she is such a bonus to the film even if her role is still a female accessory in the typecast action thriller.",7,2,6,14 August 2012
22 Jump Street," a solid summer comedy
","A torrid weekend, the best recreation is a cinema getaway in the local multiplex, the options are paltry, having no slightest interest in the fourth TRANSFORMERS juggernaut, I have to choose between two sequels, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 or this one, it is a tough choice, I enjoyed HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010, 8/10) thoroughly, but due to a recent impassivity towards animations, eventually I opt for the latter albeit I have yet watched its predecessor, a Hollywood comedy might be the elixir to quench the summer lethargy.After their debut animation CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (2009), director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller went in for revive the popular 80s undercover policemen series 21 JUMP STREET (1987-1991) on the big screen, and it was a box-office hoot in 2012, two years later, the sequel arrives, the odd pair Hill and Tatum go to college this time! School days are mostly stupid in retrospect, drugs, parties, sports and hormone-driven sex adventures, one must be glad to finally get over with them, thus, understandably the main arc of the story is the √† la mode bromance between Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum), conceivably an impending fissure is magnified by Jenko's jock popularity in the fraternity and Schmidt's contrasting nerdy awkwardness. The investigation to unearth the WhyPhy (a new campus- permeating drug) dealer are considerably short-circuited by incessant japes and bro-bonding- or-clashing set pieces which are functionally devised without resorting to the low-end and cringe-worthy lavatorial jokes. A time-tested one is the classic unintentionally sleeping with your boss' daughter and the romance benefit falls upon on Schmidt, he meets the art student Maya (Stevens) and competently justifies 'nerds are the new sexy', until a raging Ice Cube stereotypically break them up. Meanwhile Jenko has a more conventional male-bonding with fellow football jock Zook (Russell) with an unspecified undertone comes close to a fantasy for more trendy interest, along with many bold gay-related insinuations. It is scintillating to witness a not-over-stagy let-go-and-reunite plot mingles with two partners certainly care for each other where sexuality is irrelevant. The natural bond is authentic, which is the only thing matters. Tatum grandstands in the mandatory action sequences with Hill's rib- tickling unwieldiness, but villains are carelessly characterized, up to the moment when they fall prey to utter triviality and deprive of any sense of being other than their default duty. During the ending-credits, a deluge of mock-sequels pokes fun of industry's franchise over- exploitation, and this year earlier, the Lord-Miller pair has already stunned the world with their money-making bulldozer THE LEGO MOVIE (2014), a new profitable product-line awaits a follow-up, so with two smash golden bowls in their hands, 23 JUMP STREET might come to its fruition behind the usual two-year schedule, or perhaps 22 is also a wonderful number to leave our perky memory unsoiled.",6,1,3,29 June 2014
Amadeus," Amadeus
","From the most important contemporary Czech director Milos Forman, whose sole work I have watched before is THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996, an 8/10) and he has gotten hold of two Oscar wins for BEST DIRECTOR, one for this film and another one for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975), which seems to stay in my must-see list forever. Being illiterate to classic music, my ignorance surprisingly doesn't spoil my appreciation of this biographic masterpiece about Mozart and Antonio Salieri, a one-sided chicanery between the innocent genius and the jealousy-driven lesser-known. Scrupulously structuring, with a cut- back opening starts in the asylum, a lunatic Salieri recounts his rivalry with Mozart to a young priest who hopes to receive his confession. The story is told with intermittent elucidations from Salieri (facing the priest), to stress on the contexts of his love-and-hate battle with Mozart, whom he reckons sent by God to test his devotion and loyalty, and when he has been continuously humiliated and eclipsed by Mozart's unparalleled talent, his feeble mental state commences twisting the God's will and scheming to destroy Mozart covertly, which he has finally succeeded, but also boomeranged on himself, what's more impressively done is Mozart, even till his eternal rest, is still unaware of Salieri's shenanigans and ironically believes him as his best friend.Accompanying by Mozart's canon, the film is pristinely remarkable in almost every facet in spite of its 28 annual rings, screenwriter Peter Shaffer concocts an intriguingly dexterous storyline without confining his two protagonists into a stereotypical mire of good and evil, which are exemplified in both characters with an intelligent instillation. The two leading actors, the Oscar- winning F. Murray Abraham (whose trashy post-Oscar career is a mystery to me) and his fellow co-nominee Tom Hulce (whose ebbing post-Oscar nomination career is another case here) are beamingly satisfying to watch on screen, Abraham has more angles to show off Salieri's manifold flaws and inward confrontations; while Hulce's droll invention of an eccentric nonconformist prodigy requires more grit and artistry in my opinion (now my mind is clogged up with Mozart's squeaky and hysterical laughter). A baby-face Elizabeth Berridge and a restrained Jeffrey Jones (who could have thought he was quite handsome in his youth) have done their best bit to be the foils as Mozart's money-seeking wife and a congenial Emperor Joseph II with a meretricious taste in music respectively.Since now most biopics are in a stasis of narrative sterility and vapid resources, this film could be used as a textbook reference, picking a different position, leaving more room to let audience to do the assessment, or simply finding a more contradictory pair of a legend and his/her antagonist.",9,1,2,12 August 2012
Kick-Ass," Kick-ass
","I saw half of the film on HBO several months ago in the hotel room and it became another unfinished business which had been gnawing at me until yesterday I eventually watched it from A to Z, and my response is that it's really a kick-ass to all other major film studio comic superhero franchises! I don't intend to put a stance to appreciate this film just to feign that my heart is still as young as a schoolboy. I love this film from the bottom of my heart and I emphatically believe director Matthew Vaugh has done a stupendous job which almost alter the entire formula of the corny genre and what's more worth a round of standing ovation is that the film is killingly entertaining as well!Hit-girl is predestined to become a cult idol along with the film itself (and its box office fiasco is a bonus), the controversy she created has becoming a sensational impressiveness which stuns the youngster generation and some maturer age group like mine. A 12 year old slaughterer with an innocent loli's face and mind, which may not be original but definitive provocative, and the gratifying yet unsettling part is Chlo√´'s steadfast-cum-innocuous performance, killing only could be such fun in a morally nontoxic way which a film is able to manifest and I can sense the surreal zest pervading in the air! Kick-ass (an unostentatious Aaron Johnson) by comparison, is a more empathizing character, which is also dealt with some realistic impetus to allow viewers to judge it by a more rational afterthought, a true hero never need the shield of 'super' power, all one needs is training and proper equipment, a pragmatic truth (it's more convenient if you are as filthy rich as Iron Man or Batman).The film and the directing definitely crack into my top 10 list of the year and Chlo√´ is among my top 3 supporting actress in 2010 as well. Also I feel a bit belated compassion that Matthew Vaugh's forte didn't been fully brought into play in the X-MEN: FIRST CLASS this year as sadly few could substantiate his true color under the mainstream Hollywood sway, especially for those newly-recruited.",9,3,6,1 December 2011
The Man Who Would Be King," The Man Who Would Be King
","As a Nobel winner for literature, Rudyard Kipling is a controversial figure, by contrast, this film adaption is a featherweight crowd-pleaser, but unfortunately I find it cannot live up to the height of its literary counterpart, and its colonialism smugness festers further, which I personally feel ill at. Directed by venerable and acclaimed director John Huston, the film starts from a series of exotic South-Asia vistas, then bumps into a rapid hustling with Christopher Plummer as the avatar of the renowned writer himself intermingling with Sean Connery and Michael Caine's Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, two British solider resigned from the army and going to try their luck in Kafiristan. Then the cut-back narrative slowly but thoroughly turns into a slapstick daredevils' wacky adventure into a tribal residence. The action part is awfully crass, the battle fighting and using rifles to massacre local tribes could never be shoddier, at least they could have hired a team of more professional extras or at least trained them with a little bit more commitment. Only the props and the settings opaquely convince me it is a big budget film, the mind-blowing blizzard and avalanche are something quite spectacular to watch, but all fail to be foils; The two leads Sean and Michael, both at their prime, delivered a solid bromance which could be the only non-artificial part I could recall. Colony and religion, are like guns and roses, they never mesh together well, plus the patronizing attitude alone could exasperate its audience especially foreign ones like me to consider the film is a sheer miscarriage (though it had received 4 Oscar nomination with no wins).",5,7,23,1 September 2011
Ghostbusters," an 80s classic fun-raiser
","My belated visit to the 80s classic ultra-popular American supernatural comedy directed by Ivan Reitman, indisputably his most successful directorial work to date, the Hollywood veteran is now in the inevitable course of being eclipsed by his son Jason Reitman, who is already a two-times Oscar-nominated director (JUNO 2007, 8/10 and UP IN THE AIR 2009, 7/10). The film stars Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as a trio of nerdy parapsychologists in New York, after being dismissed by the university, they initiate a service knows as Ghostbusters to deal with the more and more frequent paranormal activities in the city, things then trace back to Gozer, a Sumerian amorphous god of destruction, who is going to wreck havoc on the city, with the aids of its two servants, Zuul the Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster, two ferocious dog- shaped demigods.The core trio (later joined by Ernie Hudson as the fourth member to appear politically corrected) predates the current trend of brain-is-the-new-sexy, Peter Venkman (Murray) more or less is a philanderer and particularly disarming in his aloof attitude to the gravitas of their cause. Raymond Stantz (Aykroyd) has a more guileless mindset, a man-boy hybrid will lovably bring about a beast of a giant marshmallow man. Egon Spengler (the late Ramis) is the geek among geeks, a stern-looking scientists with fully-functional apparatus to bust some ghosts. Peter's new love interest is Dana (Weaver), their first client soon to be possessed by Zuul, so is her neighbor Louis Tully (Moranis), as the receptacle of the Keymaster. The special effects are very much 1980s, but they are also the brainchild of a genuinely extraordinary creation, massively uproarious in its pokerface seriousness (not to mention its contagious theme song by Ray Parker Jr. The wacky script written by Aykroyd and Hamis is the mainstay of its distinctiveness, Murray's iconic personification of his on-screen image is droll to watch, Weaver is beguilingly titillating after the possession and Moranis's loquacious improvisation slightly overstays its welcome, but appropriately dovetails itself into the demigod.Very rarely a comedy can blend well with its spectral fodder and family-friendly closeness, GHOSTBUSTERS is far from being a perfectly executed masterpiece, or a cutting-edge cinematic pioneer, but its common-or-garden stance effectively boosts the 'everyone can be a hero' message, no wonder it has been an enormous crowd-pleaser and bred into a beloved franchise since the inception. I may skip its 1989 sequel but a long-delayed third installment doesn't seem to a bad idea at all, or the latest rumor is the BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10) helmer Paul Feig is eying for an all-female reboot, it sounds much more enticing, Bill Murray even gives his own suggestion of the casting, see here",7,3,3,9 September 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," On a par with the first one!
","My latest cinema-going of a 3D spectacle of the second chapter of the Amazing Spider-Man, whereas its first installment THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2012, 6/10), a reboot of Sam Raimi's sensational SPIDER-MAN trilogy, is a hit-or-miss in general, but the Garfield and Stone pair does stand out with their affable affinity and spontaneous chemistry, so when it is time for Stone's Gwen Stacy to take a bow and exit the franchise, as fans know it from the start, her fate is presaged by the comic books, it is a double-edged sword to separate the most adorable couple in the marvel realm, initially one might be fixated in an ambiguity of thoughts that she will survive, since it has happened in THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10), but when the lingering shot fails to bring her back to life, it is somewhat tear-jerking and befuddling to realize she has been killed off just like that, as the expendable female character in any superhero franchise (like Maggie Gyllenhaal in THE DARK KNIGHT 2008, 8/10). It is a bold maneuver nevertheless (if Samuel L. Jackson's resurrection in CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER 2014, 7/10 could ring a bell), opens a new possibility for the following storyline, but I doubt anyone can follow her shoes because Stone's Gwen is not a clich√© trophy girlfriend, she has brains, she leads the way in their relationship, Spidey is even willing to gives up his NYC territory and follow her to Great Britain, I would love to see a Spider-Man in London spin-off, which would be so tantalizing but sadly the production team will never allow that, Spidey represents the America's heroic spirit, so that's it, he is staying. The 3 villains scenario has been oversold when they actually showoff in individual turns to combat Spider-man and Paul Giamatii's Rhino is basically a warm-up for next film, and the new Green Goblin Dane DeHaan pays off as a perfect choice thanks to the acute casting, his storyline is bypassed largely since Jamie Foxx's Electro is the MVP among the trio, which is rather badly written and utilized (his hatred towards Spider-man is so tediously manipulated and beyond logical reasoning). So with Gwen out of the picture, I assume next step is Spidey Vs. Green Goblin in their love-hate entanglement which is a safe bet for its mass appeal. The acme of its standard action sequences by all means should be Electro's fluorescent and electricity-sizzling battlefield and his rampage in the Times Square, an eye-opener but the most vivid delight belongs to the affectionate magnetism, casual banters and escapades between Peter and Gwen, which is what director Marc Webb's strongest suit, at any rate, it is on a par with its predecessor, and the 3D effects are marginally passable this time, but honestly speaking I don't harbor too much hope for the third venture, there is perpetually a dearth of a weighty female counterparts in the marvel kingdom, let alone one has just been haplessly dispatched.",6,2,7,7 May 2014
Ex Machina," Stunning debut from novelist-screenwriter Alex Garland
","EX MACHINA auspiciously marks the directorial debut from British screenwriter Alex Garland, who is also a novelist, he is the author of THE BEACH, later would become a misfire for Danny Boyle and its star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2000, and after having soaked himself as a screenwriter in Sci-Fi genre pieces like Boyle's SUNSHINE (2007) and Mark Romanek's NEVER LET ME GO (2010), his latest offering is a tantalising cautionary tale about artificial intelligence. Compacting the kernel among three main characters, Nathan (Isaac) is the CEO of world's largest search engine company Bluebook, he invents a humanoid robot named Ava (Vikander), and Caleb (Gleeson) is one of his lucky code programmer, who has been chosen to be give Ava the classic Turing test, to determine whether or not she has 'intelligence'. There are seven sessions altogether carried out in Nathan's reclusive scientific research centre they are accompanied only by Nathan's Japanese assistant Kyoto (Mizuno), who apparently cannot understand and speak any English.Caleb is an ordinary young man with a tragic back-story, wide-eyed and thrilled to be involved in this evolutionary achievement of humankind, as he tells Nathan, it is not just a change of the human history, but in fact if Ava passes the test, it will change the history of Gods, because only God can create intelligence! As the centre encounters constant unknown power-cuts, during which Caleb and Ava are sequestered from being monitored by Nathan, Ava warns Caleb that Nathan is not what he seems to be, and they gradually share a mutual affection to each other. Swayed by Ava's warning, Caleb begins to secretively dig into Nathan's works, and a discovery drives him to become paranoid to an extreme extent that he even questions his own identity, is himself a robot too?Under the influence of Ava's commitment, a gullible Caleb schemes an audacious plan to elope with her, in the other hand, Nathan is the opposite of gullibility, who is friend and who is foe, Caleb will have to learn the lesson in the hardest way he can ever imagine. A great viewing experience with suspense and concentration can be crystallised through the film's integral accomplishments of the central trio's dynamic acting, awesome shots of nature's luxuriant palette to expel the default claustrophobic atmosphere, a thoroughly engaging and sometimes eerie soundtrack adheres flawlessly to the structure of the narrative, all is done with the sleek competence which indicates Mr. Garland is going to have a bright future in the director's chair. Maybe one can say the A.I. created in the film is really ahead of our time, but one relevant thing concerns everyone is his sharp perception of mobile phone companies' tacit permission of amassing private data from billions of their users, this is an alarm bell to urge our society and government to investigate the current situation and prevent such privacy-violation with uncompromising legal means. Performances are top-form, Domhnall Gleeson is profoundly utilised to elicit compassion and support as audience's surrogate to adventure in a tempting chess game, and his ANNA KARENINA (2012) co-star Vikander is stunning in passing off as an android with inscrutable depth of wisdom can outsmart most human beings, blur the definitive line between man and machine and potentially supplant them, this is man's deepest fear in the booming genre concerning A.I. technology, plus a precisely rendered CGI does help tremendously for the film's surreal tonality. Oscar Isaac, is charismatic and enigmatic simultaneously, as the most unstable variant of the trio, the key driving force with an ulterior motivation, his can alternate from chummy geniality to threatening menace in one second, moreover, a surprising vignette of his dance routine with Kyoto is plain stroke of genius under its context. To say the very least EX-MACHINA is an earnest and compelling piece of hard Sci- Fi thriller who challenges to tackle the subject matter into a more pertinent situation and establishes itself as a sounding warning against the possible negative reverberations of today's fairly impressive progress in the cutting-edge field.",8,2,8,17 May 2015
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," a stunning, thought-provoking anime worth the name of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli
","Hayao Miyazaki's second anime feature film, NAUSICA√Ñ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND is an adventurous post-apocalyptic fable that presciently and astutely imparts us what will become humanity's ruination, humans. While Miyazaki's fatalistic outlook runs deeply in his works, he knows how to tell an intriguing story by putting a doughty protagonist in the cynosure, typically, a young girl ne plus ultra, possesses all the merits of human nature, against the worst-case scenario, in this case, the residual mankind is facing the aggression from giant mutant insects (called 'ohm', resembling a trilobite decked with numberless eyes) peopling a sprawling toxic jungle as the aftermath of the Seven Days of Fire, a war has obliterated most of human civilization. Nausica√§, the princess of Valley of the Wind, an untainted Shangri-La covered by verdure and powered by pneumatic energy, becomes the linchpin to thwart this seemingly inexorable annihilation, even if this means she must sacrifice herself.But what becomes involute is Miyazaki's off-beat sensibility to seek transcendent beauty beneath (in its very literal sense) the overwhelming darkness and venom, perchance those ohms are not aggressors but protectors of the planet earth, the purifiers to detoxify it from human's undue contamination, this revelation strikes like a gut-punch to our anthropocentric conformity, and instantly gives this anime a rightly cynical yet self-examining heart that seminally elevates it to the stratosphere of this unique art form, apart from the artifact's sweepingly fluid craftsmanship of redoubling narrative integration and bizarrely awe-inspiring cel animation imagery, to say nothing of Miyazaki's vibrant palette that often exceedingly appeals to kids and adults like. As enterprising and edifying as any masterpieces hammered out under the brand of Studio Ghibli (in truth, the studio was founded in 1985, after the film's success), NAUSICA√Ñ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND might lose a modicum of plaudits for its rapid-fire agenda-divulging, viz., the motives behind Tolmekia and Pejite peoples are somewhat discombobulating for subtitle-reading first-timer, also the prophecy-fulfilling finale might crop up a tad slapdash and sappy if one is familiar with Miyazaki's other works. At any rate, quibbles do not obscure all the virtues of Miyazaki's thought-provoking masterwork, garlanded with Joe Hisaishi's synth-generated bravura and a humble reverence to the animistic existence, NAUSICA√Ñ OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND is a timeless classic, indeed, not for anime aficionados alone.",8,1,1,14 July 2018
Hidden Figures," a high achievement of orthodox entertainment from Hollywood
","Soaring as the highest grosser among 2016's Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees in North America (edging $170 million), HIDDEN FIGURES is a biographical treatment of 3 black female mathematicians working at NASA during the Space Race, whose unassailable contribution is glaringly juxtaposed with harsh working-place discrimination in a segregated America barely 55 years ago (the fact still stings).The film's impeccable triumvirate are Katherine Goble (Henson), who is still with us today at the age of 98, a genius in mathematics plays a consequentially key part in astronaut John Glenn's (Powell) launch and return from the orbit; Mary Jackson (Mon√°e), who is aspiring to become the first Black female engineer in America and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), an under-appreciated supervisor-to-be, hampered by her skin color. All three are spirited, honest-to-God gals who would eventually satisfyingly win their overdue respect for their competence in the cutting-edge sphere, flags up the quintessential American spirit - winner takes the all. On paper, the story would easily fall into the pigeonhole of a hagiography with all the crevices papered over in pursuit of the straight-forward political correctness, but miraculously under the able hands of director and co- screenwriter Theodore Melfi (his second feature film), the final product is immensely enthralling and rewarding, although a deeper probing of characterization is skated over, but by dint of its tub- thumping milieu and the mounting injustice (both racism and sexism in the rarefied high-tech rung) these three women take in their dignified stride, everyone can find a congenital connection with them and involuntarily roots for them because if there is any justice in this world, this is it!Shy of expository screed on technicality, and juicy in its confrontational sparkling and homely felicity, HIDDEN FIGURES is a high achievement of orthodox entertainment from Hollywood, gives access to the lowest common denominator without being fluffy or patronizing, ambidextrously balances its innately rousing source material with glistening performances: Taraji P. Henson is a formidable force to be reckoned with and particularly eloquent in her big moment of outpourings good and proper; Octavia Spencer, exudes incredible panache against her stock appearance, reaps the token nomination for the Oscar glory; but it is high time to give a backslapping to Janelle Mon√°e, only her second film credit (after MOONLIGHT 2016) for the famed chanteuse, her Mary is a firebrand but not scanty with humor and sobriety, that scene facing off a judge in the court is in my druthers, the single best delivery of the entire film, which she nails with unbelievable confidence and earnestness. Meantime, let's not begrudge our thumbs-up to the lighter-skinned counter-performers, Kevin Costner, channels his 'white face' proponent with a heartfelt vibe in measured sagacity, and two 'black face' antagonists, played by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst, might not be as one-note as they let on, the modulation in their attitude shows up inviting subtlety in the script-writing.HIDDEN FIGURES, a film encourages, inspires and galvanizes its audience with a cogent message about real-life encountering with the ever-present benightedness, surprisingly not so long time ago, its timing couldn't be more opportune if we must firmly believe the world is changing into a better place, it does give us some spark of hope, doesn't it?",8,1,8,30 March 2017
Coco," COCO is heading to notch up that Oscar grail and emerges as another jewel in Pixar's ever-impressive crown
","COCO, Pixar's 3D animation tearjerker, ushers in a buoyant epoch when Pixar bracingly and fully sinks its teeth into ethnic pluralism and the first round is from USA's adjacent neighbor, Mexico. The story takes place on the Day of the Dead (starting from 31st October), the annual Mexican holiday when the living ones gather together to reminisce their deceased family members and friends, predicated upon which, director Lee Unkrich, co-director Adrian Molina and their co- screenwriters envisage a kaleidoscopic world beyond the grave, in the business-as-usual Land of the Dead, if you are rich and famous in this life, like the legendary musician/film star Ernest de la Cruz (Bratt), who is the hero of our leading character, a 12-year-old Mexican boy Miguel (Gonzalez), you can parlay your career into the afterlife, the only modification is the physical form, now you are a skeleton! Moreover, on the Day of the Dead, the dead can also across the marigold bridge to our world, to visit their families, provided their photos are presented on the family ofrenda. Miguel is from a household oddly at loggerheads with music, because his great-great-grandfather chooses a music career over his family, so music is the absolute taboo in the house, but after being convinced that Ernest is his great-great-grandfather, and magically yet inexplicably transferred to the Land of the Dead when he thrums Ernest's guitar in his tomb (a hiccup in the otherwise cogent and perceptive script), after the initial befuddlement, he embarks on a quest to seek the blessing from Ernest, in order to pursue a music career like him, before returning to the Land of the Living. En route, he gainsays the blessing from his great-great-grandma Imelda (Ubach), which contains a proviso that he must forswear his musician ambition, and is helped by H√©ctor Rivera (Bernal), a down-in-the-luck former collaborator of Ernest, to infiltrate into Ernest's palace. In return, Miguel agrees to bring a picture of him to his daughter, whom H√©ctor can finally pay his visit, and time is kicking because his nonagenarian daughter is the last one on the other side who still remembers him, if her memory of him fades away, he will meet the 'truth' death, vanishing from thin air. The plot spiritedly darkens and thickens when Miguel somehow is in the know of what actually happened between Ernest and H√©ctor and the causation of the latter's death. A twist aptly arrives just when the viewers start to get a hang of the whole picture about Miguel's genealogy, and the ensuing thrills-and-spills kickstarts like a roller-coaster with a cliff-hanger, then back to the world of the living, Miguel sings that heart-warming number of REMEMBER ME to facilitate a completely justified happy ending in both worlds. Here, what reverberates universally and poignantly in every adult heart is the well-intentional message that our memories become the linchpin of those departed in another realm, which both projects a more propitious look on death itself and inculcates the traditional family value but without condescending into homily, believe it or not, even the most hardened cynics would involuntarily shed a tear or two during its finely honed process of emotional cleansing. Visually polychromatic and aurally mellifluous (Anthony Gonzalez is a boy genius in voicing our little hero), vamped up with a miscellany of indigenous folklore staples, culture heritage and topographic features, COCO is heading to notch up that Oscar grail and emerges as another jewel in Pixar's ever-impressive crown, alas, one just cannot say the same to the cutesy Disney short OLAF'S FROZEN ADVENTURE, ill-fatedly affixed shy of a masterpiece could simply put the former in the shade.",9,1,3,11 December 2017
Lincoln," Lincoln
","Last year USA-born Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY (2011, 7/10), this year the academy will (seemingly) reciprocate a third Oscar to Brit Daniel Day-Lewis in his rendition of Abraham Lincoln. It's a fair trade, both represent the highest echelon of acting supremacy, a biographical piece of world-known historical figure is the safest touchstone.But LINCOLN is directed by Steven Spielberg, an industrial tycoon who has nothing to lose and at the same time nothing could surpass his previous accomplishments. Last year WAR HORSE (2011, 7/10) and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN (2011, 9/10) didn't exactly restore his capability as a superb director, but leading this year with 12 Oscar nominations, no one can argue it is the best chance for Mr. Spielberg and his team to attest their credentials and may be exulted with the glory. I watched this film in a local cinema, being an non-American and a politics apathetic, the film doesn't grow on me as it should, it has its undeniable merits (an intimidatingly detailed script from Tony Kushner and a first-rate collective work from all the thespians, to name a few) and if its ultimate goal is to reach a more geographically diverse demography, call me pessimist, the outlook seems bleak.Since the plot is a no-brainer, this is a battlefield for brilliant thespians, like a Shakespeare play, everyone is howling and bellowing, inveighing and swearing, with a scattering of bons mots and repartee. But how much viewers can feel in Lincoln's bones while watching this film? History is always written by the winners, since Lincoln is a valiant winner, whose conscientious endeavor to abolish the slavery may seem to be more like a political decision other than out of a visceral compassion as a human being, his stratagem can out-wit all those brains around him, the film, is well-positioned as a paean to American's beloved leader, Mr. Spielberg has been never so unassuming since his extraordinary career path. The almighty Daniel Day-Lewis will be an insuperable crest for any actor in the drama range, whose congenital talent and meticulous preparation for his roles can spontaneously set up a bona fide paragon in actor's kingdom. His Lincoln is a mystery, a distanced role-model of the generations, a 'perfect man'in almost every aspect, but his struggle and ordeal still penetrates from within. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones, luckier than other supporting roles, clinch their showboating emotion burst and excavate their Oscar-worthy depths in their characters, two textbook supporting nominations are well-deserved. The film is a high-caliber biographical flagship, but film should serve us a bit more than being a (politically) fly-on-the-wall machine to recount what had happened (who can tell what is the truth anyway), and highlight some uplifting moral triumphs, if it can spike its main course with some unexpected cinematic wizardry, then it will be a huge bonus. Nevertheless, supposedly no one will grudge too much if it wins big (e.g. BEST FILM & BEST DIRECTOR apart from DDL's third naked Golden stature) in the upcoming Oscar battle, afterward, Oscar is profoundly USA-tagged, it has its proverbial boundaries, but who doesn't?",7,1,4,30 January 2013
Sing Street," a beacon of prowess in filmmaking
","After BEGIN AGAIN (2013), his Manhattan sortie with Hollywood named stars, Irish music aficionado John Carney's latest flick regresses to his native territory in the spirit of ONCE (2006), SING STREET casts a cohort of teenagers against the retro milieu of Dublin in the mid-80s, friskily encapsulates the music ambiance of that epoch (featuring hits from THE CURE, A-HA, DURAN DURAN, SPANDAU BALLET, THE CLASH etc.), which potently lures those who are in his age group into the realm of nostalgia and reminiscence; on the other hand, its central coming-of-age-and- puppy-love plot and high-school band rebellion can vicariously connect with younger viewers, up till Post-Millennials. That is a win-win stratagem. SING STREET, is the name of the teen band found by the high-schooler Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo), a 15-year-old boy who has just been transferred to a free Christian Brothers state-school on the Synge Street due to his family's economic restraint, a microcosm of the doldrums smothering the whole country at then. At home, his parents Robert (Gillen) and Penny (Kennedy) constantly rattle each other's cages, and his hemp-incensed big brother Brendan (Reynor, who tends to chew the scenery whenever sharing the same frame with his greener co-star) presciently tells him their marriage is hanging by a thread. At school, Conor is picked on by bully Barry (Kenny) and clashes with Brother Baxtor (Wycherley), the atrocious school principal. The reality sucks, (at one time, one character virtually calls Dublin a shithole), the only vent for Conor is music until he meets his muse Raphina (Boynton, a bliss for a not-so-likable character), an attractive model-to-be who is one year older than him, but thanks to the obsolete makeup and get-up of that period, hardly she and Conor seem to belong to the same age bracket prima facie. Jumping on the bandwagon of all-the- rage music videos, Conor takes the initiative to form a band, recruited Eamon (Kenna), a multi- instrumentalist (who definitely needs a movie of his own) among others, so as to ask Raphina to star in their videos. Raphina is intrigued for the invitation, but like many an Irish folk at that time, London is the holy land for her, not here in Dublin, the video-shooting is just some pastime before her impending departure (with her adult boyfriend who promises her a bright future in London), and Conor knows it very well, he is prepared for the disappointment but love is love, especially the very first crush, how can a boy resist that beautiful feeling? The film's forte, indeed, derives from Carney's unsentimental angle of inducing a piquant benevolence and sincerity when deciphering the pre-adolescent vagaries of moods in the sometimes harsh, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes delightful reality, and his refusal of padding out the garden-variety narrative with hokum dialogues and feel-good bells-and-whistles (as used in most similar themed pictures). Everything goes pretty much as we expect (bar the impulsive ending), but there is also a can-do vibe pulsating along with the story's frolicking teen spirits, where ingenuousness and defiance are melded together to leaven the film to be more relatable (also ascribed to the deft job from cosmetics section). Bloating ego, showbiz swagger, internal conflicts, demerits would imaginably stem from the scenario have no access to taint the kids' revelry, although, in my case, the band's largely original punk-pop tunes are too nondescript for my tone-deaf ears. Finally, its semi-fantasy, semi-reality coda, speaks volumes of Carney's tendresse towards his young protagonists - dare to love, dare to dream and dare to fight for one's dream, which rounds off this retro-inspiring crowd-pleaser with a substantial leap of artistic licence - a beacon of prowess in filmmaking.",7,1,2,19 January 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: 7/10
","The film has gained its popularity since its domestic run in Sweden, adapted from the first book of Millennium Trilogy (the rest two, The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest were all released in 2009). As a crime thriller, the film's global success lies in its well-arranged hackling of all the clues and releases them slickly (a little bit predictable as well), however the main attribution is to introduce a new star Noomi Rapace into Hollywood, her appearance and performance are so coherent with the character, which I can hardly sense she is acting. Millennium Trilogy is Noomi's stepping stone to success, next year we will see her in the new Sherlock Homes film along with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. As a punk-look hacker, our heroin shows sheer feminism, the highlight arrives when she is inserting a dildo into the pervert's anus and tattoos him later. Actually the revenge is not men-offending, on the contrary, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the callous vengeance finally fulfilled. I am very much stroke by the murder cases here (especially a frigid location of Sweden), it seems that the cruelness and coldness of the nature surrounding is overspreading inside people as well, as for me, posing the excuse of the brutal crimes on the flimsy religious and sexual grounds is too unrealistic. The cinematography is another merit, at times I saw the snow scene against a mesmerizing sea-blue sky set off by the haunting score. I hear rumor says that the second and third feature is not as good as this one, I find it is a perfect ending I just stop here and wait for David Fincher's remake coming out next year, which certainly I am more interested.",7,1,3,21 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," THE LAST JEDI expectedly bottoms out in the abysmal nadir in its story-line, only awaits a spark of new hope to ignite its retaliation next round
","The prospect is bleak, this entire Episode VIII of STAR WARS saga is a concatenation of the Resistance forces' half-baked escaping plans from the claws of the indomitable fleet of the totalitarian First Order closely on their tail, so one has to hand it to Princess Leia Organa (Fisher, in her swan song) for still being able to bullishly encourage a handful of survivors in the coda that, paraphrasing here, they still have everything they need to start the rebellion from the scratch, attagirl!Taking the rein from J.J. Abrams, Rian Johnson continues the story right after THE FORCE AWAKEN, and assigns the triad of our new protagonists on different missions - Rey (Ridley), to recruit Luke Skywalker (Hamill) on an awe-inspiringly otherworldly island overlaid by the aura of the force and a Jedi temple, where she telepathically connects with Kylo Ren (Driver) and is confident that she can turn him to the bright side; a hot-to-trot Poe Dameron (Isaac) stays put on the main Resistance ship, and unwisely plots a coup against the surrogate leader Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Dern), when Leia is in recuperation after surviving an attack decimated other top brass; then Finn (Boyega), teamed with a low-rank, Asian-ethnic Resistance member Rose Tico (Tran), is sent to look for a code-breaker in the Canto Bight casino (a resplendent heaven for affluent warmongers and arms dealers), who can disable the First Order's tracking device, which doggedly shadows its quarry even during light speed universe. And amazingly, all goes awry, Rey's ganging up with Kylo Ren only helps him to usurp the throne from a pompous Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis); Poe's coup is practically nugatory and he had better stay put, since Holdo has a viable exit route to operate, and the worst of all, is Finn and Rose's vacuous sally, not only are they suckered by a neutral-standing maverick code-breaker DJ (a golly relaxed del Toro), which stands for Don't Join, but a more devastating outcome is that the pursuers get wind of the Resistance's clandestine plan, mortality escalates, and there is blood on both Finn and Poe's hands for their poor judgement, yet everyone is too philosophical to moot that can of worms. Designated as the middle section of a trilogy, there is little wonder THE LAST JEDI is prescribed as a plumb descent to an astronomically unfavorable preliminary to the final epic, but Johnson's stratagem is pretty unorthodox to a fault of severely undercutting our investment in those young heroes (peculiarly enough, not the antihero), meantime, we gallantly gird ourselves for the valediction of the old, legendary trinity (Han Solo, Luke and Leia), which renders the next chapter look pretty precarious from this angle. Looking at the brighter side, it is illuminating that Rey's parentage doesn't entangled with a blinkered consanguineous linkage with the Skywalker clan, which speaks volumes that the force is not totally hardwired, it is up for grabs to all comers, as the final shots manifest. Also, an uncomely Adam Driver starts to really rally our support in his ascendancy, it is such gaiety to see him time and again telekinetically abuse General Hux (Gleeson in his most unabashed camp). As a hallowed and well-loved Hollywood behemoth, which is too clunky and institutionalized to soup up with any unwonted tones, Johnson's effort is to say the very least, mildly laudable, under his fine-tuning, THE LAST JEDI expectedly bottoms out in the abysmal nadir in its story-line, only awaits a spark of new hope to ignite the impending, disproportionately heroic retaliation next round.",7,5,25,21 March 2018
Brave," Tangled Vs. Brave
","Inadvertently I have watched this two Disney animations hand-in-hand (TANGLED is from the orthodox Disney branch while BRAVE is its flagship Pixar production), which seems to be a perfect paradigm to juxtapose them together and to dissect the state-of-the-art tendency of the mainstream genre (enormously profitable since its chief target are zero in on family with children, so it has a much more important and instructive obligation other than merely an entertainment for the toddlers and above). Coincidentally both films' heroines are princess (Rapunzel in TANGLED and a Scottish Merida in BRAVE), adapted from Grimm Brothers' tale, TANGLED is supremely reminiscent of Disney's other established princess analogs trapped in a magic world, let's say Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what's more, there will always be a prince-charming to deserve and requite her love. Wisely Rapunzel's Flynn Rider has been sizeably modernized as a reckless, self-mocking yet conservatively 'Disney' prince with a thief background. But in BRAVE, Merida is a much more radical rebel by blood, she doesn't have or need a prince with white horse (the film doesn't care to proffer one since all her tribe suitors are one-of-a-kind wackos), she is fighting against her predestined life path which her mother has arranged for her and her status has requested her, a tad thread-bone notwithstanding, but chronicling with a single-linear arc, the mother-daughter predicament has slipped to the hanging-by-a-thread situation when a magic spell transfigures the Queen's appearance into a bear which cannot be recanted after the second sunrise, therefore, instigates an intimate bonding phase for the two, viscerally the mutual love only exudes when something unusual happens, while living in the mundane life, we are all suffering and grated by the love with a insurmountable generation gap. Rapunzel, on the other hand, her main barrier is the ultimate breakthrough from her 'mother' Gothel (a greatly overlooked Donna Murphy), who raises her and locks her up in the tower for 18 years, treats her as her own out of a selfish but very understandable motivation (to rejuvenate her youth), but out of any sequential transition, all of a sudden Rapunzel miraculously remember her princess identity (she was taken away when she was an infant, so I doubt there is any memory there, more like an implausible epiphany or actually a screenwriter's block), what's more unbelievably awkward is that she immediately snarls back to her 'mother' as if all the recollections of Gothel's evil scheme has been replayed in front of her eyes and she has been tortured for all that year long (actually she is fairly happy and content alone with her cutesy chameleon) , which I deem as a child's play, very much panders to its core audience of pre-school demography. So, from a vantage point under the contemporary context, BRAVE is far more daring and enthralling from its 'no guts no glory' premise, it is able to identify with a way broader audience, which is also the main ingredient of the winsome recipe 'why Pixar can keep excelling all its peers (if not itself) on the top-tier of the hierarchy', in spite of that on a technical level, all the major animation studios in Hollywood (DREAMWORKS, BLUE SKY STUDIOS, etc.) are almost equally cutting-edge. Music is Disney's strong suit, the first half of TANGLED is a conventional musical showcase, culminating the saccharine romance with the Oscar-nominated theme-song I SEE THE LIGHT, fusing with an intoxicating lanterns-all-over-the-sky spectacle, this has always been the tactic to emit Disney's overblown sentimentality, I am certain it is no longer an all-age proof method now. In BRAVE, although Kelly Macdonald and Emma Thompson's heavy Scottish accents do not get along with my ears, the exotic score and tunes are generally agreeable, and what's more admirable, it doesn't steal the thunder of the film per se. Honestly speaking after the astonishingly-acclaimed WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10), I automatically skipped last years CAR 2 (2011), BRAVE is a left-field choice, the scale of the story has been slimmed down to a quite unimaginable mother-daughter clash, even grafting it on the most platitudinous soil of a princess's tale. But by good fortune, the film doesn't smear Pixar's paramount reputation, Merida goes through a well-deployed rite-of-passage and the sub-plots such as the blue wisps, the ancient lore of the discontent brother and the witch's hut are all positioned into the right niche to uplift the mythology and idiosyncrasy of the film. As for TANGLED, Disney will never relinquish its tradition (otherwise Walt Disney will definitely be jumping inside his tomb), and it is also an exquisitely-made piece of work, just unfortunately paled by comparison by BRAVE since there is no sparks glittering and all the chirpy happiness seems synthetic and a bit stale.",8,2,4,11 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Here comes the Marvel picture phase II
","Leaving the Avengers behind, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY heralds the 2nd phase in the Marvel's silver screen expedition as IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) kick-started the 1st phase. But who is James Gunn? whose director r√©sum√© only encompasses the gooey horror SLITHER (2006) and a superhero indie SUPER (2010). Watched it in 3D, the film is a hyper-diverting adventurer amalgamated with slick action set pieces, legit humor and emotion and spectacular visual impact, the chemistry among its quintet coterie is potently pleasing, the comic timing is on the nose, and the most euphonious trait is its 70s-retro soundtrack, which is a killing nostrum to identify itself among Marvel's other imposing juggernauts. It is hard not to compare this to the STAR WARS series, an inter-galactic combat assembling unlikely heroes (various species) to prevent an evil (and dark elfish) super-villain, Ronan the Accuser (Pace), whose intent is to acquire a mighty orb (the McGuffin) to rule (or destroy) the universe. As the first chapter, naturally, it turns out that Ronan is merely a minion, there is much more overpowering force behind.The team includes Peter Quill (Pratt), aka. Starlord, a 30 something human; Gamora (Saldana), a green-colored assassin trained by Thanos (an uncredited cameo by Josh Brolin); Rocket, a cybernetic raccoon (voiced by Bradley) and his best friend Groot, a creature with the appearance of a walking tree and limited vocabularies (the viral I'm Groot! voiced by Diesel), and Drax the Destroyer, a red-tattooed brawny muscle (Bautista). The film is at the top of its game when the 5 gather together, bickering and jesting, they never take this saving-the-universe deal too serious, unless things deteriorate into the moment when self-sacrifice is exigently needed, surprisingly Rocket and Groot are granted much more humanity than their human-shaped comrades. Even in the crucial showdown scenes, when Starlord and Ronan stand face to face, a playful stunt conveniently eases audience from the edge of the seat, if the characters themselves don't engage in the plot, why should we the rubbernecks? Bad-drafted villain is always a frailty in Marvel's kingdom, Ronan is so plainly written, the supposed career boost of Lee Pace is still unaccomplished, so is Hounsou's Korath, while Gamora's vicious sister Nebula (Gillan) is in no better condition, but at least her storyline will continue. Yondu Udonta (Rooker) is between friend or foe, whose sentient arrow is the wow factor one wishes it will keep shooting in the next installment. Benicio Del Toro as the Collector and Glenn Close as Nova Prime, both have meager screen time, no chance to run the show. Aimed to nostalgia and accompanies Starlord's Han Solo carefree flair, the mix-tape hits from 70s are unexpectedly well maneuvered, devoid of a present-day background, it is a smart move, and more poignantly, the obsolete Walkman emanates a strong connection between a guilty son and his deceased mother, no upbeat rhythm can beat that! No wonder its soundtrack is already a No.1 selling album in USA.In conclusion, the film is an above-average marvel production, great job for Gunn and his team, establishes a ragbag of lovable roles besides the Avengers assembly, and it has the prospects to be the STAR WARS of this generation, intriguingly, the rebooted Star Wars sequel is also heading towards us, soon we will find which one is the bona fide winner. But one must confess, Marvel does have an upper hand with the ultra-success of this picture.",7,8,13,19 August 2014
Jerry Maguire," a feel-good treat concocted with a conscience
","For those who endearingly miss Tom Cruise as a fine actor, or Cameron Crowe at the top of his games, JERRY MAGUIRE is a blast from the past. Our titular hero (Cruise) is a smug predator in a cutting-throat capitalistic business, who suddenly grows a conscience, and then immediately makes a wrong move, trying to exhort his peers to also grow a conscience, unfortunately the majority of those is too cynical to accept his noble motion, he is therefore blackballed and according to Murphy's law, must hit the rock bottom, which only leaves him a loyal admirer/accountant Dorothy Boyd (Zellweger), his only client, an under-the-radar football star Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr.) and a goldfish. Tailored to USA's pernicious winner/loser ethos, the subsequent upswing must diligently tackle two most important things a man must obtain, his career and his love life, to prove the world that he is not a loser but a bona-fide winner, aka, it is the 'kwan', that really matters to one's truth worth, a magically coined word by Crowe. Cogently the film thrives as a sincere page-turner albeit Crowe being rather deferential towards all the genre tropes, his script coruscates with a cordial sympathy towards Jerry's fix and a tangential self-awareness of eschewing the mawkishness, conceivably, it is a story borne out of affection and deliberation, but one defective looms large in the end is that Crowe doesn't get more into the agent business maybe because it is not his forte, the triumphalism is approached through Rod's doughty sportsmanship (a cinematic but garden-variety antic with a sharp tang of cruelty, in real life, more often than not, a player is physically permanently damaged), and what Jerry has attributed to the triumph is regretfully left largely untapped, however he would right this wrong in his next film ALMOST FAMOUS (2000), which is more in his element, inspired by the days when he was a contributing editor of Rolling Stones Magazine. One might argue JERRY MAGUIRE is the film where Tom Cruise's Hollywood golden-boy charisma is in his highest voltage, and his effort is incontrovertibly contagious, ever so remarkable he devotes himself entirely to a character which is quite self-referential in a manner (riding a money- seeking business, deviled by commitment issue, cannot deal with being alone), sheds self- consciousness and flexes his muscles to bring forth exigency, compassion and warmth, in company with a honest-to-goodness romance playing off against a self-abasing Ren√©e Zellweger, who also punches above her weight in a conventional ugly-duckling role but spiffed up with a strong sense of dignity and sensibility, she knows when to waive what doesn't worthy of her even it is what she really wants, that is in my humble opinion, the most valuable takeaway of the whole movie. The homey atmosphere is also magically graced by a heart-melting Jonathan Lipnicki as Dorothy's cutie son and Bonnie Hunt's protective but amenable elder sister (although that divorced women group gag should be relegated to a cheesy chick flick dud).Lastly, about Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Oscar victory, he does strut his stuff with a highfalutin bravado, errs on the side of being clownish but essentially an entertaining hoot, like the film per se, a feel- good treat concocted with a conscience.",7,4,5,9 July 2017
Jurassic World," Nostalgia wins!
","I am on my vacation in Croatia, but cannot resist the temptation to visit a local multiplex and watch this box-office record-shattering blockbuster, now has officially revitalised the JURASSIC PARK franchise, it brings back the nostalgic audience who has welcomed and impressed by the first tent-pole came out exactly 22 years ago with umpteen salutes, and competently revamps the visual spectacle to win over new audience. Director Colin Trevorrow and his team has accomplished a quite impressive job! It is basically the same old story, only the scale is proportionally swollen, now Jurassic Park is a fully operating theme park, and our antagonist here is a genetically mutated creature, Indominus Rex (not a dinosaur in the traditional sense, as its DNA carries more undisclosed samples from other species), who is smart enough to trick its human creators and runs amok, wreaks havoc on both human visitors and dinosaur habitants on the island of Isla Nublar. The park's operational manager Claire (Howard) teams up with Owen (Pratt), a veteran now is a raptor trainer on the island, to find Gray (Simpkins) and Zack (Robinson), Claire's nephews who are entrapped in the dangerous zone, and bring them back to safe places. Meanwhile, Hoskins (D'Onofrio), the head of security, thinks it is a great opportunity for a field test of the trained raptors, as he intends to use them in military uses. Under the commander of Owen, four trained raptors are released to track Indominus, but the scheme backfires as soon as they realise the latter contains the former's DNA too. The prolonged survival battle will need the old ruler of the food chain to settle the scores. Chris Pratt is presently the mascot of North American box-office, his down-to-earth persona and his respectful attitude towards dinosaurs attainably confronts Bryce Dallas Howard's high-maintenance facade and her commodity view on the genetically created behemoths, their clashes are metered out with beguiling charm to appease the lowest common denominator, as the latter can literally outrun a T-Rex in her high-heels, and generously the film grants her a trans-formative curve to be connected to the living things and her nephews. Ty Simpkins, who has stolen the thunder from Robert Downey Jr. in IRON MAN 3 (2013), again here he is utterly adorable and conspicuously heartwarming in a role doesn't expect to demand too much other than screaming and running! Irrfan Khan, as the owner of the entire enterprise, Masrani, stands out in his caricature of a man whose leisured passion eventually becomes his doom.The SFX is in its full-blown fashion as we can get a glimpse in the trailer, it aspiringly offers more leeway for the interaction between visitors and its permanent residents, like the 'gyrosphere' experience and the mosasaurus splash. However, as Indominus is the only villain most of the time, its ubiquitous presence, does feel too contrived, which later can be also referred to the 'betrayed' raptors, as viewers have the full knowledge of how enormous the island is. It certainly tones down the sense of 'epic-ness' one might expect from such a ginormous project. Otherwise, JURASSIC WORLD hits all the right notes, massively enhanced by Michael Giacchino's golden accompanying score, as a studio product tries to parade its most generic appeal to lure as many as audience possible, and nothing is wrong of that, as long as viewers can identify with some respect has been thoroughly taken into considerations during the production line.",7,9,24,19 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," The Adjustment Bureau
","Quote what Emily Blunt's Elise Sellas rightly said in the film 'I think I'm not a romantic type'. So am I, adapted from a short story from Sci-Fi mogul Philip K. Dick, The Adjustment Bureau is a more lovey-dovey type than a Sci-Fi saga, maybe in another term, it is a straightforward romantic-chick flick camouflaging with a soft Sci-Fi shroud, (compared with it, SOURCE CODE 2011,is way more hardcore and theoretically compelling).It's kinds funny to see all the hat-men from bureau engage themselves into the break-up mission with meticulous deadpan, which against the fact that the director clearly has no intention to elaborate the so-called butterfly effect or chaos theory plan. (Thompson, Terence Stamp's character, states that the bureau has been manipulated the globe since thousands years ago, WWI and WWII are the exclusive gaps when they were experimenting on human beings to run the world themselves, what a portentous bluff! We all should thank bureau to stop the war and question what the hell is the 2012 doom then?). One merit pops up is the strong affection between two leads, despite of Matt Damon's wooden face, neither Matt nor Emily excels in playing lovebirds (cf. Matt Damon in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES 2000, with an alluring Penelope Cruz). This time, with the help of the random doors, their engagement intensifies and we are not allowed to ruminate during a spate of space travels (not so original though, cf. JUMPER 2008). As a novice in the director field, the screenplay writer of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007) George Nolfi took the thorny task to both direct the film and write the screenplay, the result could be worse, I must say, with visual swiftness and an Utopian concession to romantics, at least he has aimed right on target.",6,0,1,8 August 2011
Prisoners," Gyllenhaal steals the show!
","One more Hollywood recruiter of foreign talents, Canadian Villeneuve (from INCENDIES 2010) submits his Tinseltown debut with a dark drama about a child abduction, congregated by a swathe of bankable thespians and a virtuoso DP Roger Deakins, it was a considerable success both in box office and among critics, although its Oscar prospect will not likely pan out. PRISONERS conventionally chronicles the appalling case with thorough stoicism to supply enormous stretches to the key performers, Jackson and Gyllenhaal are the two leading players, one is a dogged father believes in his own judgment and is pressured to take extreme measures to fish out information of his missing daughter; another is an idiosyncratic cop has to probe into a sordid scenario while his own backstory remains veiled. Through all these years Gyllenhaal has honed up his screen personality substantially and his quirky foibles (the compulsive blinking here) make him more human while Jackman is a tad over-the-top with a more straightforward character development. Bello, as the flip side of Jackson, her post-trauma symptom is being fully destroyed, cannot function anymore, a devastating mother is a piece of cake for her; Howard and Davis pair stand for a more neutral ethnic line here, which one can relate to oneself under the context, but their shortcomings are as glaring as they are ubiquitous. Dano, who takes us aback with another ambivalent career-turn, his make-up in the torture scenes is too surreal for general viewers, theoretically we should feel sympathetic for him, but somehow he manages to diminish this feeling with his look of opaqueness, is he a real retarded victim or a lackey enjoys the gore? It is a moot point where lingers great aftertaste. We cannot leave Melissa Leo behind here since she is the hidden culprit, her reasons for killing aside, her performance does enhance the story's credibility, and although her downfall is ordained, her encounter with Jackson in the ultimate confrontation is gold and only she can emotionally overpower and cramp Wolverine into his redemption into the darkness. Villeneuve proves wonderfully he is a dab hand can handle challenging projects like this, the whole production team is top-notch, Deakins' camera irradiates specifically in the car sequences near the end, alongside the cutthroat editing, a subdued iridescence can never be more ravishing and what's more praiseworthy is that it thrusts the narrative into its ultimacy with utter urgency and dazzlement. PRISONERS sits comfily into my top 10 year-list, PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR (2 spots), SUPPORTING ACTOR and SUPPORTING ACTRESS, for my no-gut-no-glory Oscar prediction, I sincerely hope Deakins can sneak in, alas, even so, he is no chance of winning over GRAVITY (2013, 9/10).",8,1,2,19 December 2013
Silence," SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence
","From this reviewer's view point as an agnostic, the excruciating question of religious faith, or in fact, any form of belief, is so rigorously emphasized on a person's exterior conduct, but since our 'real' thoughts can only be accessed by ourselves (or the Almighty, if he exists), thus, what is the big fuss if a Christian steps or spit on Jesus' effigy, which doesn't necessarily means he apostatizes, because he is the only person who knows about his faith, and if he chooses keeping one's faith intact inwardly and truly, he is still a good Christian in every respect, not to mention in doing so, he can save innocent lives. That's one tough lesson learned by the young Father Rodrigues (Garfield) in Martin Scorsese's passion project SILENCE.Stuck in pre-production limbo for ages, SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence, majorly shot in Taiwan as a surrogate of Japan, it is a tortuous crucible for the two Portuguese Jesuit priests Rodrigues and Garupe (Driver, galvanized with astonishing physical transformation in his latter scenes), to assume their duties in a Christianity-persecuting Japan in the 17th century, with a covert mission to find out what has happened to their mentor Father Ferreira (Neeson), who has been propagating gospel in Japan for over 15 years, but the recent tiding says he has renounced his faith after succumbing to the torture from Japanese authorities.Breathtaking cinematography is a default attraction borne out of its exotic locale, and SILENCE doesn't disappoint from DP Rodrigo Prieto, who is landed with the film's sole Oscar nomination, luxuriant mountains, inclement weather, decrepit villages, grim shorelines, Stygian and foggy night sailing, are the visual accoutrements of the priests and their poverty-ridden believers' trials and tribulations. Unavoidably, glancing exclusively through a westerner's eyes, there is no excuse of Japanese government's high-handed cruelty towards those wretched citizens, which Scorsese doesn't flinch from presenting with explicitness, and one might argue at certain point, this monotonous practice almost shades into a religious torture porn - the opprobrium which Mel Gibson's astronomically lucrative THE PASSION OF THE Christ (2004) once notoriously received, it turns out, when wrestling with contentious religious topics, not much one can do to avoid being curtained by personal angles, whether you are the populist Gibson, or a more cinema-savvy Scorsese. (Coincidentally, Garfield is the star of both SILENCE and Gibson's HACKSAW RIDGE 2016, comparing their orbit in the past Awards season, it shows that the populace does plump for the less thornier one, even it is too on-the-nose in its thudding message).Here, the message is more opaque, after Rodrigues' meandering faith-clinging-and-violence- witnessing struggle comes to a halt when Ferreira appears in front of his eyes, Rodrigues' final capitulation shows up his own shortcoming: he yens for dying as a martyr, like J.C. before him, he can endure any corporeal affliction for higher goals, because he wants to believe he is the chosen one here on earth like the former (when he sees J.C.'s image in his own reflection), so what devastates him is that he is exempted from physical crucifixion, alternatively, the devious Japanese inquisitor Inoue Masashige, played by Ogata with affectedly slippery, inflicts him with the burden and responsibility of the sorry ends of other God-botherers, that stratagem effectively dashes Rodrigues' high-minded illusion and degrades him as a mere mortal, and ultimately he makes the choice as any sensible human would do under that circumstances, and in due time, makes peace with his religion in the closing scene penetrated by a textually surreal shot, when all is said and done, as amorphous and exclusive as one's own faith is, still, Scorsese needs a token to vouchsafe his reckoning - the little cross. So, my take of this film is less trenchant a testing ground of how one can sustain his faith when facing appalling adversity than a finger-wagging to our nature's innate egoism, superiority and self-righteousness, after all, humility is and will always be the linchpin of human race, it is the only way to reach one's peaceful niche and immune to the omnipresent vice.Garfield takes up another formidable gauntlet and sinks his teeth into a deep-dish tormented character, stoutly embodied with anguish, doubt, obstinacy, disillusion with a shade of dewy-eyed callowness, as for Neeson, he leaves a more neutral tinge of ambiguity in a much hyped character, meanwhile the Japanese cast is purely adornments, more often than not, teetering on the brink of one-note (Asano) or repugnance (Kubozuka).The losing battle is the self-aware religion debate, which encompasses the big chunk of the conversations between two conflicted denominations, but accentuating God's silence, which de facto is religion's most overt attribute, as the clincher of the central story (God has always been, and hopefully will always be remaining in silence, so why would that be a matter of contest to his faithful disciple at any rate? Wouldn't it be a proviso which every intake has to accept before taking one's vow?), takes some shine of this film's profoundness and empathy. It is a hard-sell, but if Scorsese can't pull if off, one might wonder who else in Hollywood can?",8,1,2,23 March 2017
Logan," another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation on the big screen
","This gore-permeated, pathos-riddled final chapter of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine trilogy startles its audience with not one, but two curtain calls of iconic characters in the X-Men franchise, and director James Mangold (whose previous Wolverine vehicle is a styled but ultimately self-defeating oddity) ensures that his R-rated version will do something very different from other CGI-heavy products of Marvel cinema, where emotion vacuum has been repeatedly desensitized in favor of visual bombardment. The scale is relatively small (no metropolitan city is threatened by impending danger), set in 2029 where mutants have been almost extinct (the reasons beyond that are both a woe of Professor X and a progressive measure from dietary intake), a world-weary Logan (Jackman), now moonlights as a limo chauffeur, traveling to-and-fro between USA and Mexico, to take care of a delirious Professor X, aka. Charles Xavier (Stewart), a mumbling nonagenarian and episodically inflicted by seizure and is unable to keep a tight rein on his psionic superpower, can only be tamed by medication, meanwhile the albino mutant Caliban (Merchant, a bug-eyed phantom actually has a golden heart) is Logan's sole help. All Logan wants is to save enough money and buy a boat so that they can live in the sea while the rest of the world stays out of harm's way, because the blast induced from Charles' seizure has already caused disastrous collateral damage to those in the vicinity, but the advent of a Mexican nurse Gabriela (Rodriguez) and her so-called teenager daughter Laura (a commendable debutante Keen) will eventually sabotage his plan. It turns out, Laura is very much like Logan, she is a man- made mutant using Logan's own DNA by Doctor Rice (E. Grant), who takes a vocation to capitalize on mutation to manufacture killing machines, Laura is one of his experiments, but now, along with other mutant children, they are failed guinea pigs needs to be disposed of, since Rice has something much more advanced created. So, reluctantly, Logan embarks on his final adventure to escort Laura (along with Charles) to the meeting place, then with other escapees, to cross the border into Canada, where Eden, a mutant paradise purportedly exists (the metaphor of breaking away from USA today is right on the nose), at the meantime, they are hunted by the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce (Holbrook, manage to pull off a clich√©d role with verve and bemusing ambiguity), a huge fan of Wolverine's legend but also ruthlessly committed to his mission, but he is not the biggest problem for the fleeing trio. Incredibly, Mangold thrusts a brilliant human touch into the story arc, not the least is the moving Western nostalgia eliciting from George Steven's SHANE (1953) and that soul-stirring denouement when Logan is again, regretfully, embroils an innocent family into his war; yet keeps the action sequences snappy, utilitarian but uncompromisingly lethal, that introduction set piece of Laura's destructive nature and combatting prowess is such a godsend. Hugh Jackman will be forever beloved for this role, which he has been playing for 17 years, and here he is even more manifestly touching in ramming home Logan's cursed kismet with unrelenting taedium vitae, which is countervailed by Keen's perfect embodiment of innocence and dispassionateness, slowly eroded when a father-daughter bond starts to burgeon, effectively reaches its crescendo in the coda where a sort of patricide passes on the baton to the offspring. Patrick Stewart, meantime, is equally poignant appearing for the last time as the aging Professor X, his valediction is every bit as potent as Logan's. Also worth mentioning that there is also a noir-version of the film, which is entirely in Black-and- White and makes great play of the story's tragic/heroic tone, when all is said and done, LOGAN is another triumph of comic material's R-rated transmutation (after DEADPOOL of course) on the big screen, but in its core, it is an ardently past-honoring action-er doesn't shirk from the grim fate but also sows its seeds of hope with great dexterity, to a point that we won't even begrudge to bid farewell to our favorite screen heroes, distinguished by their superpower but permanently scourged by its distasteful corollaries.",8,7,11,25 June 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Too ambitious to contain as its prequel.
","As I gave THE AVENGERS (2012) a 5/10, it is a sad truth that I still haven't reached the rarefied status of completely ignoring those populist 'it' movies, like FURIOUS 7 (2015, 6/10), the second assembly of the Avengers is another box-office mammoth of 2015, and this time I have to squeeze in a small packed screening room with an equally small screen in the local cinema here in Cairo, my worst fear towards 3D technique came true, it is disastrously dim-lit, why on earth we can watch a bright trailer on our computer screen yet when comes to the real one, we have to endure this schlocky quality?I don't want to reiterate the conspiracy theory behind the 3D screening, so straight to the movie itself, Joss Whedon is still unwieldy in the task of giving each avenger their distinctive room to breathe, since we have been undergone through years of Marvel's brainwash, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Black Widow are all no more eye- opening fodder to harness, the only relatively new character is Renner's Hawkeye, so Whedon applies a timely addition to his story and makes him a family man with a wife and two children, a conventional setting shouldn't bother any none-fan-boys, it is not a big deal. Also Black Widow as the only female main character here, has to sacrifice herself to be manifoldly utilised as the sole romantic interest in the marvel Universe, gyrates from Iron Man, to Hawkeye, then Captain American, this time her 'sluttishness' finds Bruce Banner as the easy prey, maybe Thor is next in line if there will ever be a Black Widow standalone film! The new blood are the superpower twins Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor- Johnson), the former is a welcome inclusion to (tentatively) offset the sex discrimination with big promise; the latter mutters an awful supposed Eastern-European accent with a tangible sense of discomfiture, and never has a show-stopping moment like Evan Peters in X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (2014, 7/10), and his unanticipated heroic act in the end is too forced to believe, no padding or whatsoever shows he is willing to sacrifice himself for Hawkeye, is he moving too slow to dodge the bullet or actually he is moving faster than he can think, such a shocker doesn't taste good, if there is a gay-interest between them, we can buy it, but like this? A second-rate shock tactic simply because others are too important to kill-off, but if I may suggest, Nick Fury should get an early retirement forever. Now comes Ultron (voiced by a strangely unforced Spader), the mega-villain dragooned with a saving-first-killing attitude and Vision, former known as Jarvis, the operation system (Bettany) finally materialised with a human physique, continues rehashes the Infinity Stones gimmick which seems to be the nucleus of the entire Marvel blueprint. Unfortunately the fatigue of non-flesh-and-bone design of villains takes its toll after THE AVENGERS, IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10), X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. It is much feasible for the CGI technology, and there aren't enough individual bad-ass to match each and every avenger in the battle, so this seems to be the only viable way to do, an omniscient A.I. super-villain tailed with countless unvarying mechanic sidekicks to be mercilessly dispatched by our bulky numbers of heroes, yuck.One thing ameliorates from the first chapter is the location alternation, the endgame befalls on a fictional East European country Sokovia, and special cares have been assertively enforced to the hoi polloi, scenes of evacuation has been deployed as if we still believe it is happening on the earth where billions of ordinary human also inhabit.The action set pieces don't match the slickness and gymnastic tactility of CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10), the most stylish spectacle belongs to the battle shot of every single avenger fights together, composes a symphony of sensation, which doesn't last too long. Frankly speaking one can enjoy more from the internecine combat Iron Man in his Hulkbuster suit Vs. The Hulk, that's why the next instalment is called AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR with two parts and the first one will arrive in 2018 (where fortunately Robert Downey Jr. will not reprise the main leader role), it is more much engaging to watch well-established characters fight to death than with some butt-ugly metals, that's why I still hold a wee hope of next year Zack Snyder's BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE.",5,4,10,4 May 2015
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," The curtain call is a bit vague in its message, otherwise, a sterling music pic with a unique diva
","Started as an off-Broadway rock musical, HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH has exerted itself to be a cultural phenomenon, a trailblazer fighting for the recognition of LGBT minorities, and its film adaption comes in 2001, 15 years ago, directed, written and starred by John Cameron Mitchell, the fountainhead of the story and musical, is it on its way to become a latter-day THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (1975) with its ever-growing cult followers? Chances are roseate.On the surface the film is comprised of a concatenation of Hedwig (Mitchell) and his bands' live performances in different places, intersected with flashbacks of Hedwig's past from Eastern Germany to Junction City, Kansas, the most startling one is his botched sex-change operation which left her the angry inch, a glaring aide-memoire of her bio-nature and the hell she has been undergone, also a testing ground to sift out those who cannot completely accept who she is, including Tom Speck (Pitt), a scare-easy greenhorn, whom Hedwig gets intimate with, but soon he would rip off her music for his own benefit.Among all the raucous numbers in their repertoire, TEAR ME DOWN is a stunning gambit, SUGAR DADDY goes deliciously risqu√© and provocative, ANGRY INCH is self-revealing and poignant, but, the true knockout is no doubt THE ORIGIN OF LOVE, sagacious for its philosophical kernel inspired from Plato's SYMPOSIUM, enthralling for the befitting animation sequences and maximally manifests Hedwig and the Angry Inch's Glam Rock appeal and their full-fledged glitz. The following internecine schism between Hedwig and her band members, namely, with Yitzhak (Shor, audaciously disguising herself as a man), is the typical eruption of her prima donna vagaries, discloses a more sinister side of Hedwig's personae.The film sends viewers a mixed message in the final curtain call, where Hedwig performs in her male form, without those gaudy headgear and fake boobs, leaves his mantle to Yitzhak, then in a dreamlike scenery, he reunites with Tom, both naked above the waist, teary-eyed. Be a woman if you want Hedwig, don't cringe, you are finally getting your toehold in the freedom land where one can be whoever he or she wants to be! Nevertheless, the coda seems to telegraph Hedwig's acquiescence of her biological identity, is she finally giving up the fight and finding peace with herself? Hardly so, in reality, it is a lifelong crusade ahead, that's rather in the wrong side of lane if the film and the story aim to be an affirming piece of art to endorse diversity and equality.Last but not the least, a salvo of shout-outs to John Cameron Mitchell, a daredevil triple-threat who endeavours to bring his labour-of-love into fruition and leaves a glamorous mark in the soil of US queer cinema.",7,0,2,4 July 2016
Quiz Show," Quiz Show
","QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10).The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way).Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.",7,2,2,30 October 2012
Everest," a cowardly missed opportunity
","Icelander Baltasar Korm√°kur, whose career starts with 101 REYKJAVIK (2000), is another European talent recruited by Hollywood, after two mediocre Mark Wahlberg's star vehicles CONTRABAND (2012) and 2 GUNS (2013), his latest is an ambitious USA, UK and Iceland co-production retells the story of 1996 Mount Everest disaster, and it just opened this year's Venice film festival, and now a 3D format arrives in the local multiplex.One initial question (for me at least) is what compels the climbers to engage themselves in such a perilous enterprise (especially those who are not up to the challenge)? The film only delves into it superficially, the central expedition team is called Adventure Consultants, lead by New Zealander expert mountaineer Rob Hall (Clarke), who shepherds his eight clients to climb Everest, among which there are two prominent participants: Beck Weathers (Brolin), an American amateur who states that depression is cloaking him like a black cloud, only through climbing, he can get that behind, as frank as he is, it is just typical escapist strategy; another one is Doug Hansen (Hawkes), a middled-aged mailman, a plain newbie in the game, but what he pursues is the populist American dream, to prove even an everyday man can achieve an extraordinary feat like that (with a discount on the fee being the key precondition), even though (as the film tells us), it will not only cost his life and unwittingly but detrimentally with the expense of other two pros who could have survived the calamity. Therefore, both cases are not wholesome to encourage amateurs to follow suit.One can detect Korm√°kur's resolution to tell the story as authentic as possible, employs an ensemble cast to introduce at least two-dozens real-life characters (which means it is rather tough to recognise each of them in the end of the day), tones down the hyped catastrophic spectacles and allows the formidable nature being the invisible but merciless executor, human lives are really so puny in the face of it. Curbed by the real-event boundaries and out of the respect (or avoidance of legal litigation) to those who are still with us, it is understandable but also pitiful that Korm√°kur doesn't dare to venture into a darker side of what-is-really-going-on in the expedition on the human side - especially the clash with other teams and whether the tragedy could be avoided, say, if the team hadn't wasted their precise time waiting for ropes to be installed en route, or the sloppy weather forecast should also hold partial responsibility? - and whitewashes the personal schism among them. The only exception is Robin Wright's Peach, Weather's wife, during her brief scenes on the phone, betrays a relatively complex inner struggle could have thickened the plot, she is incredibly subtle in her discontent when Beaches calls her to confirm his adventure, and singles out an almost undetectable mixed feeling when she receives two life-changing phone calls, one informs Beck's demise and a later one about his miraculous survival. Whereas the rest of the bulky cast are either banally one-note (Knightley and her snot cannot save the thankless pregnant wife stereotype) or doesn't allot enough screen time to a thorough moulding, and you have Gyllenhaal, the most inspiring and versatile leading man in the Hollywood, in the line-up as Scott Fischer, the inexplicably suicide-inclining leader of another expedition group, clearly is the most interesting character, yet, Korm√°kur lets him slide into a man of no importance, this is unforgiven. Nevertheless it is delightful to see Emily Watson, who plays Helen Wilton, the base camp manager, is given a sizable role to be the direct emotional barometer of the situations, she is perfect, although it is not a big stretch from her under-utilised mother typecast in her recent filmography, after all she is the surrogate mother of all the group members.Great effort has been deployed to lend viewers a vicarious feeling to witness the stunning scenery which can only be admired by the privileged few, however it also makes the problematic character-development a more rueful decision, the film has all that required for a viscerally compelling adventurer, the authentically-looking landscape, the grand SFX, a capable cast headlined by Clarke, a late bloomer to the leading-man-ship, why shortchange all the assets with a compromising narrative under the pretence of the faux-documentary approach? What a cowardly missed opportunity!",6,0,0,22 September 2015
Midsommar," MIDSOMMAR has many strings to its exotica-exploiting, commune-disparaging bow
","Merely within an one-year span, US breakout horror practitioner Ari Aster has already knocked off his sophomore feature after the excellently gothic familial gore HEREDITARY (2018), MIDSOMMAR spirts a posse of American college students away to a Swedish commune called H√•rga in H√§lsingland, under the name of partaking the titular celebration which occurs once every ninety years.

Singin' in the Rain," one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd-pleasing charm
","No wonder it has been universally acclaimed as the apotheosis of Hollywood musical in the golden era, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN conjures up an enticing historical premise of the significant sea change in the film industry, with THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the dawn of talkie which would forever change this scope of the burgeoning media.Set in 1927, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are Monument Pictures' golden couple on screen in the silent films, yet in private Don despises the ditsy and talentless Lina, whose diva temperament and funny sheep voice is the studio's best kept secret. Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark. Six weeks before its official release, Don and Cosmo creatively advice to change the picture into a singing-and-dancing musical, renamed THE DANCING CAVALIER and asks Kathy to dub Lina, the last-minute plan saves the day, except for Lina's prestigious career as an actress.Stretching from the titular song, the script cunningly grafts a cheery romance upon the nostalgia to a bygone silent era, from the opening flashbacks trace back Don and Cosmo's slapstick entertainment (also brilliantly contrasts Don and Lina's lovey-dovey public images and their personal incompatibility), until the long and elaborate set piece named Broadway MELODY BALLET, freshly revamps several music numbers from THE Broadway MELODY (1929) and Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (1935) as a fetching homage, which is not germane to the main narrative, but introduces dancer-turns-actress Cyd Charisse's vampiric moll to the limelight.Kelly, the co-director and the leading star of the project, is swooningly deft in the iconic solo titular piece, and admirably, he also magnanimously leaves the stage for his co-stars to shine, O'Connor's MAKE 'EM LAUGH is la cr√®me de la cr√®me, his effortless agility makes the dangerous antics look ever so easy and winsome. Although billed as the female lead, Reynolds is less a spectacle especially lined up with Hagen, who is the only one in the cast nominated for an Oscar (the film's unjust snub by the Academy is another big scandal mars the award's credibility), fakes her comical tone and upstages everyone else with sheer deadpan amusement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a tested classic, a first-rate choreographic marvel, a less refined character development nevertheless, one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd- pleasing charm.",8,1,3,17 October 2015
Elysium," Elysium is yet to come for Blomkamp
","Watched this Blomkamp's sophomore feature film in theater, to some extent I was underwhelmed by his universally-acclaimed debut DISTRICT 9 (2009, 7/10), it seems that his novelistic intention overrides his implementation, notably his screenplay (this time he is the sole writer for ELYSIUM), the premise is always rosy and aspiring, but in the Sci-Fi territory, if the writer cannot justify the surrealistic world he creates with a certain holistic perspective to cover obtrusive plot-holes which are unavoidable byproducts out of the limitation of one's imagination, very likely bathos will be the consequence.In ELYSIUM, setting in 2154, Blomkamp inherits his visual motifs from DISTRICT 9 (the skeletal robot resembles an agiler Prawn) and enlarges the cosmic extravaganza by erecting a pristine man-made extraterrestrial homeland for upscale class meanwhile the seething dystopian of a scuzzy and overpopulated earth is an upgraded version of the refugee camp for The Prawns in Johannesburg. Howsoever the film's box office prospect (a tepid response from the critics and its North American income is also disheartening, $82,877,000 so far), it is a bold decision for the production company to invest and purvey a wunderkind's second film with a costly budget (reported $115,000,000) for an original Sci-Fi actioner.Accumulating an almost 4-times funds than DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp could summon Hollywood top-tier names to guarantee more tickets-buyers which backfires, however his South African kindred spirit Sharlto Copley continues undertaking a chief role as the brutal outcast ex-agent, whose ambition pans out to be even more vicious than the ostensible villain, the combo of Damon and Foster is a whimsical but diverting one, but due to the ill-fated procession of the story, they don't even share any scenes together, Damon is always a good Samaritan without memorable charisma to single himself out and Foster caricatures herself to a routine militarist with bizarre accent. All the earthbound stratum is comprised of Latinos (save Damon here), Moura, Braga and Luna is certified foil around Damon's amenable hero, contrasts sheer with the high-and-mighty White race in Elysium, robot-like but dons haute couture, speaks French and enjoys a disease-free technology. The omnipotent machine stands out as the sole excuse for earthlings to go to Elysium (actually only for those who are sick or disabled), since the lucky immigrants who stow away from earth to there (19 minutes by aircrafts, a rather facile maneuver) will all be effortlessly captured and repatriated back to the globe, so why they make a fuss over risking their lives in an ill-fated journey? Also the entire re-programming and rebooting scheme is a heedless product of a wholesome mind and cursorily conducted for the sake of being assimilated as any of its same kind. Unfortunately there are many equivocal set pieces like this pervading the entire film which restrains its potential to be a bona fide awe-inspiring eye-opener.But on the other hand, imagination is contingent on the real world where germinates all the possible routes to extend and maximize our capacity of creation, the world in ELYSIUM could be our worst nightmare comes true because it touches on the basis of our undying prejudices on individuality and the callousness and irrationality looming over the inexorable gap between the wealthy and poor, as I mentioned in my review of DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp will always be on my radar as the new blood in the massive assembly line, time is all he needs to hone up his expertise and mostly essentially is to be on the lookout for a distinctive screenplay, he will fabricate his own CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10) one day.",7,0,1,8 September 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Alice In Wonderland: 6/10
","Tim Burton is a dignitary among contemporary directors, but I have never been his devoted fan, my favorite Burton's film is Edward Scissorhands (1990) (Sleepy Hollow comes next). Also I have a little grudge over his last film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), as I find it meaningless besides its theatrical performances and gloomy settings or maybe I am just simply fed up with Gothicism.Frankly speaking, this film is only a mediocre work from Burton, the imaginary wonderland is Burtonesque but the story is witless, which evolves in a quite prosaic way without highlights or excitements. However the fun is still achievable especially I think the newcomer Mia Wasikowska's novelty is pervasive all over the film, which is adorable and eliminates lots of sleepiness. Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen are both skin-deep characters but fully bring forth the vividness. Johnny Depp is as crazy as usual as the mad hatter, but not particularly remarkable. Surprisingly I am very much impressed by the voice of Alan Rickman as Absolem, the mighty caterpillar, which is truly mesmerizing.This 3D feature won a huge success in the worldwide box office (collected more than 1 billion US dollars) as it followed the 3D upsurge just after Avatar earlier this year, however I become somewhat worried about Burton's next project as it seems that his fame is forestalling his talent to reach his maximal level, owing to a fact that Burton has never been nominated as Best Director in Oscars, which might hint us that in some level Tim Burton and Michael Bay belong to the same category, more like a skillful film craftsman than a genuine auteur.",6,1,1,9 December 2010
Chariots of Fire," an overachiever and unworthy Oscar winner?
","This Oscar-winning UK picture has been long bad-mouthed as an overachiever and unworthy champion ever since it usurped the top honor from its more artistically ambitious opponents, especially, Warren Beatty's long-in-gestation, epic passion project REDS (1981). It is an underdog's triumph, not unlike the real-life story it depicts, two Golden medals from UK running team in the Paris Olympics, 1924. One of the two winners is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), an English Jew who enters the Cambridge in 1919, and the other is Eric Liddell (Charleson), a Scottish missionary born in China (and would later die in China in a Japanese civilian internment camp in 1945), thereof, the main obstacle against Abrahams' rising is the anti-Semitism pervading the British academia, whereas in Liddell's case, the through-line is his devout persuasion and unswerving conviction that 'he will not run on Sundays' not even for the sake of the monarchy. Both accounts are interwoven steadily with jaunty verve and charming lucidity, and put the reasons behind their running to the forefront.In spite of a face-off in the same competition, brotherly rivalry is never the thorny issue (although it would be undeniable more interesting than the patriotic hagiography in the offer) once they both are recruited to partake in the Olympics, together, they must take up the gauntlet from the elite across the Atlantic Ocean (two US cinematic rising stars, Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher, are cast in small parts). Liddell would stir quite a controversy with his intractability but as long as he would win, it only incarnates his integrity. Inherently, running doesn't entail too much visual grandeur and their duration is fleeting, Abrahams wins in the 100 meter (barely over 10 seconds) and Liddell prevails in the 400 meter race (less than 50 seconds) respectively, so in order to accentuate the tension and glory of the process, director Hugh Hudson pragmatically implements the slo-motion shots to capture the racing moments of the two, especially Liddell, whose spiritual immersion has reached an almost grotesque state of hallowed elation, shows up the sublime pull of competitive sports from a rarefied stance. And of course, it couldn't be honed up to that effect without the anachronistic electronic score by Greek musician Vangelis. The core young cast boosts great empathy of comradeship and determination (although one can quibble not all of them is endowed with a professional runner's physique), Ben Cross and the late Ian Charleson are fine picks but a beaming Nigel Havers is the one who infuses something altruistically wonderful in his wide-eyed conviviality meanwhile Alice Krige is radiant in her silver- screen debut as Sybil, Abrahams' love-interest. Among the veteran bracket, John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson delightfully pair up as a Cambridge duo of uppishness and Nigel Davenport leaves a pungent mark of cunningness as Lord Birkenhead, but it is Ian Holm's half-Arabic, half- Italian running coach Sam Mussabini takes the token Oscar nomination for the ensemble. In hindsight, CHARIOTS OF FIRE is an ostensibly feel-good fare with all its edges being circumspectly smoothed, a dedicates piece of work to propagate sportsmanship and a not-too- subtle agitprop boasting UK's glory and heritage, as well as the consummate devotion of one's religion, a safe bet pandering to a more general, Western-leaning taste but of high-calibre production value, that is, to this day, still the winning formula to allure Oscar votes.",7,3,4,18 February 2017
Frank," A gimmicky device of a wrong-notioned way to find success in the music industry
","One major gimmick of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson's music drama-comedy FRANK is its star Michael Fassbender (the 'it' actor presently) will only appear with a giant paper mask containing his head and never reveal himself in the entire film, but spoiler alert! It turns out that Lenny cannot keep the promise and allow Fassbender's sex appeal (his face to be more accurate) to go untapped and be concealed inside that doll head. So in the last ten minutes, when our eccentric titular protagonist Frank (Fassbender) finally reveals himself without his shield to the outside world, a mixed feeling arises, admittedly Fassbender is my favourite actor among his generation, it is a surprise to see his visage (thanks to the deceptive publicity stunt) in the climax scenes of the film, a pathos-exuding music performance of the song I LOVE YOU ALL, written by the composer Stephen Rednecks. However at the same time, a part of me wishes Lenny Abrahamson could have had the guts to let Frank do the scenes with his mask on, keep the eccentricity running until the last drop.Jon (Gleeson), a young wannabe musician is audience's proxy in the film, who has by chance been recruited as the new keyboard of the experimental band Soronprfbs, where Frank is the band-leader, and Don (McNair) is the manager, with band-mates Clara (Gyllenhaal), Nana (Azar) and Baraque (Civil). The film is at its best when the whole band is retreated to a remote cabin in Ireland in order to record a new album, Jon is the wide-eyed newcomer tries very hard to blend into the quirky coterie, while others are generally in their wheelhouse to prepare themselves for inspiration and creativity, with occasional financial problem reminds them everything has a due date. Jon covertly records the videos of their daily activities through his twitter account, and Frank's idiosyncrasy (or maybe their unorthodox music) actually generates considerable cyber fandom for the band and they get an invitation to play in the upcoming SWSX festival. Thus Jon takes it as a springboard for the band to meet a bigger audience, which is unfortunately not in accord with the ideology of other band members, particularly Clara, whose inexplicable hostility towards Jon is invariably present ever since their first eye- contact, it is the essential contradiction between an esoteric artist and a mediocre songwriter, 'mediocre' is always the original sin for those pretentious artists. Then Frank, apart from his bizarre habits, during the recording session at least, he seems to a normal chap, with clear articulation and occasional humour to mentor other people and give them life guidance. But after a tragic turn (with a comical joke on ashes), Frank and his band is about to play live in USA in front of their potential groupies-to-be, but interior strife plays havoc on their solidarity, eventually the performance (with only Frank and Jon) is a fiasco, and both Jon and audience realise that for sure Frank has a bigger problem than his peculiarity suggests. The mystery unravels during Jon's visit to Frank's parents when his mask is finally taken off, we are obliged to see Frank as a scarred human being, true to his slow-witted ungainliness. While Jon, the innocuous young man, who wastes all his inherited money from his grandpa on the band, has gotten a stab on the leg and run over by a car, everything he hopes ends up to be a pipe dream just because no one informs him that his way to success is not the right way for Frank, the selfishness of other band members cannot be left without feeling chafing. That said, Maggie Gyllenhaal's fiery aggressiveness is quite enjoyable to watch, no sympathy needs to be squandered on her and she successfully pulls off a sort of characteristic nonconformism in constant begrudging of die-hard idolatry which she never gets. In any case, the film is too wacky and half-minded to convince us with Frank's talent in this line of business which supposes to have some leverage to reckon on and what every other musician should feel envious of, instead one cannot help but feeling sorry for Jon, I doubt this would be the initial response Lenny Abrahamson had envisioned from his audience in the first place, or as simple as that sometimes attention-grabbing oddity can be easily mistaken as talent, especially in our age, it can happen in a daily basis.",6,0,1,10 May 2015
Selma," Significant and relevant, DuVernay has the ball!
","An exceptional episode of the legendary activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (Oyelowo) truncated 39-year-old life is finally brought up to the big screen by a female black director DuVernay, chronicles the historical voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, which pressures president Lyndon B. Johnson (Wikinson), to pass the bill to eliminate restrictions on voting for black people. An Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee with only another nomination and final win for BEST ORIGINAL SONG (GLORY by Common and John Legend), to a great degree, is viewed being discriminatingly given the cold shoulder over other key nominations such as for Oyelowo's leading actor and DuVernay in directing, a perennial disdain aiming at the senior-white-male demography in the academy. Yet, Rome is not built in one day and for the elderly, it is ever harder to change their deep-rooted prejudice, so we need more patience.Started in 1964, when King accepts his Nobel Peace Prize and addresses an earnest speech sans rhetoric as possible as he can. Oratory is a critical mainstay in Oyelowo's performance, not impeccably resembling King in person, Oyelowo imparts an extraordinary poise to lay bare the most human characteristics in King as opposed to his iconic image, which is mainly reflected in the showcasing sequences of a few significant speeches, and they're magnificent in spite of the overhanging perturbation that they may fall into overblown strategy which we have all seen too many times. But in other time, viewers also get a chance to observe King's life in private, the interactions with his friends and followers, dissenters and politicians, more intimately is the subtle tension between him and his wife Coretta (Ejogo), who is severely stressed by the frequent prank calls with life-threatening viciousness and the looming danger can never be dissipated around her husband and their family, DuVernay even humanises King with a tabooed reference about his affairs, allows him a considerately long time to answer Coretta's forthright question. King is dethroned from being an ideal idol, his indecision is shown in the critical moment of the movement, not the guideline belief, but the practical side.Whether or not political machinations are involved is the grey area, for example, who has miraculously arranged national TV broadcasting of the first small-scale march, King's men or other parties? The film refuses to divulge any information on that front, which prompts the whole scene to appear like a rehearsed performance, those fearless black people as canon fodder whereas King conveniently skips the initiation march, bravely take the beatings from the police defence, then being timely manoeuvred on TV to instigate a national sense of compassion in favour of the beaten, all smells too fishy, that is why we should give DuVernay two-thumbs up for her guts to debunk the elephant-in-the-room, the utterly putrid side of USA's democracy, even for such a noble cause, the movement cannot be achieved without those sly tactics, where a small number of innocent people must be sacrificed for a bigger and loftier picture, what's more stringent is, until today, the same pattern still prevails and reality barely advances in the race prejudice half a century later in America. That's why this film is so significant, in a worldwide scale, many places are all on the analogy of this.For president Lyndon B. Johnson, DuVernay also bravely utilises the dramatic license to antagonise him against the crusade, everything is contingent on a hierarchy of priorities, the equality vs. supremacy battle only becomes urgent when the situation makes him and his government look bad, not because it is the right thing to do NOW, another applause for DuVernay to conspicuously materialise that corruptive facade of bureaucracy. And thanks to Tim Roth's unrepentantly despicable portrayal of Gov. George Wallace, which pushes him as the No. 1 villain here, audience is granted a glimpse of the true color of a unabashed politician, both Wilkinson and Roth are excelling in animating these two unsympathetic characters on the screen with their superb expertise, galvanising to clap eyes on.SELMA is first and last, an uncompromising piece of cinema recounts a not-to-be-forgotten and pretty recent triumph in our awakening consciousness against social injustice, it tells us more than its subject matter - not to diminish the importance of equality, since it is still a long way to go in any bifurcation to reach egalitarianism, moreover it is also piquantly dangerous, once we realise the roots of our society is based on a system corrupted by human frailties, it can attribute a more pessimistic view towards our own existence as human beings, and that is not for everyone, that's why it is an oddity in the mainstream conduit, personally I think this is the reason why it gets snubbed other than the ostensible race and gender partiality, thus albeit political themes are rarely my cuppa, but for this one, DuVernay wins my endorsement thoroughly.",8,0,1,2 September 2015
The Artist," The Artist
","Having watched this soon-to-be Oscar winner in the local cinema (after repeatedly brainwashed by its trailer in the multiplexes), indeed it's my third encounter with silent films behind SUNRISE (1927), and FINANCES OF THE GRAND DUKE (1924). The film is masterfully presented from the very beginning until the NEAR-end. THE ARTIST is among the laureates of 2011's film territory without any doubt.But, in my very own opinion, the much-anticipated Oscar sweep is simply a victory of nostalgia. If it had been made decades before, say 60 years ago, it would be boosted as a silent version of A STAR IS BORN with an excellent cast and splendid score, smooth and melodic, and be ascertained as a major contender but with little likeness to procure the sure-fire ultimate winner kudos which it has now in 2012, when audience has been accustomed to talkies for ages. THE ARTIST is defying all the regular habits to remind cineastes that a silent B&W film could be so potently entertaining and watchable. My point is that I don't think the film itself should take all the credit, though the team behind does have a genius concoction to evoke the retro fixation to its core targets, film-related mass which are the pillar of the film industry (academy included for sure). I doubt who in the field will not love the film? It's a crowd-pleaser for filmmakers, especially the elderly rank. (Actually THE ARTIST and HUGO are holding the same slant here, but Martin Scorsese utilizes tons of money to invest a monolithic fantasy while a foreign no-name Michel Hazanavicius and his troupe achieves the same effect through a more lightweight and unconventional approach, so if the ballots are leaning towards THE ARTIST, no one should scratch their heads.)Also another edge of THE ARTIST is that despite of the pungent situation of both film's languid box office income is embarrassing no matter who will win the game eventually, there is an essential difference between them, that is THE ARTIST has no difficulty to retrieve its meager budget ($15,000,000), meanwhile HUGO seems to be on the right track of becoming another commercial flunk like THE GOLDEN COMPASS (if not more) even though it's a Scorsese vehicle, which is not an encouraging exemplar for Hollywood tycoons to bankroll their future projects. Digressing back from the film itself, Jean Dujardin is my current winning for BEST ACTOR, whose protean flair of balancing between comedy and drama is admirable and compelling; Ms. Bejo's ambiguous leading/supporting status maybe hamper her ballots but she is impeccable in the film. The said 'NEAR-end' incident concerns my thought of the final scene of the talkie moment, which is a regretful anticlimax for me (although sound and words are plied flawlessly during the middle session to underline the conversion to the talkie era), but Mr. Dujardin's French accent last word is not attuned with his character at all, which downgrades the film as well.Anyway, I could have rated the film higher, but my heart goes with HUGO, but who cares?",8,3,7,21 February 2012
Invictus," Invictus
","The truth of why I didn't watch this film until now is that politics and sport are literally the two things attract me least, nevertheless after a second thought, I would like to give Clint Eastwood another chance, anyway, how worse it could be? So, the after effect is that it does make me apathetic in spite of the fact that technically speaking, Clint Eastwood may not deserve a standing ovation, but actually he did a decent job to strive for a lesser poignant affectation in viewing of the vast backdrop story of a world- famous ex-president of South Africa.One thing I do enjoy in this film is the cinematography, reminds me of MYSTIC RIVER (2003) and MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), my favorite films of Mr. Eastwood (thanks to the same DP Tom Stern). The scene where the plane flied over the stadium is the eureka moment for me, otherwise I must admit that I have seen better. The two Oscar-nominated leads Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are surely watchable but way overrated in my own opinion, especially the latter, Matt is physically not a rugby player no matter how hard he tries, also his character is in lack of a deeper excavation. As for old Morgan, his imitation of Mandela is worthy of some compliments but does not make my top 5 list of 2009. The biography genre usually is Clint's masterpiece, the upcoming biopic of J. Edger has raised my expectation to an utmost peak (finger crossed for Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Watts, Armie Hammer and Judi Dench). Hope it will get Mr. Eastwood another culmination as personally I show more respect towards those late bloomers.",6,0,1,20 April 2011
La La Land," an absolute stunner and expert raconteur
","The opening film of Venice '73, a strong contestant of the Golden Lion, Tinseltown's latest prodigy Damien Chazelle's wildly-anticipated follow-up of WHIPLASH (2014), LA LA LAND is an exuberant revamp of the Golden Age's musical formula and miraculously transposed onto a contemporary milieu, an absolute stunner and expert raconteur chronicles the effervescent romance between a jazz pianist Sebastian (Gosling) and a waitress Mia (Stone), who aims to break into the showbiz in the City of Angels, without ever compromising its realistic spin.Fully embracing the widescreen splendor, the film's winning opening gambit is a slithering singing- and-dancing sequence on the chockablock freeway choreographed in one dashing long shot. Then the film pans out its narration of an ever-typical girl-meet-boy story (in this case, it is the girl who makes the first move), divided by seasons with a winter-to-winter rotation, initially, the story bifurcates in two different forks until the two finally hit the ground running, interposed with scintillating music numbers which can hypnotically melt your heart and dazzle your mind. Chazelle adroitly centers on two protagonists through and through like in those vintage romantic flicks where you can see haloes around them, anyone, anything else in their world has all duly faded into the dark background whenever their eyes meet, their hands touch, and they kiss.Gosling and Stone, whose on-screen dynamism has been patently tested in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE (2011), let sparks fly higher as they plunge wholeheartedly into the torrid journey, from misunderstanding, meet-cute, falling for each other, to supporting each other's dreams, taking the middle ground or simply giving up, doubting and bickering, to the highest level of unconditional and unadulterated love - the holy sacrifice to let go of each other when their time is due, the Gosling-Stone pair is superbly amicable, adorable and charismatic, each is blessed with their own tuneful theme songs CITY OF STARS and AUDITION respectively, and satiates viewers with a show-stopping tap-dancing. Gosling, as dapper as ever, oozes with a heart-throbbing attentiveness and devotion as a talented pianist who is bent on opening his own jazz bar, a traditionalist but deadly romantic; Stone, portrays a character so naturally rooted in her chromosomes, an aspiring actress-to-be finally pays her dues after numberless humiliating auditions, her vivacity, comic timing and line delivery are top-notch, both are eyeing for their second Oscar nomination at this stage.Heading to the upcoming Oscar race, Chazelle, of course, is the one who deserves all the fanfare for his virtuoso directing competence, one will be sublimely intoxicated by his vision of L.A. envelopped with an indelible mauve palette in lieu of its usual sun-dappled glamour, vibrant props and tableaux vivants, not to mention the central music elements, which is always in the veins of Chazelle's works, his cherry-picked jazz-fusion, the fluent and sleek choreography, Justin Hurwitz's overwhelmingly soothing attendant score apart from several striking ear-worms, all those above-mentioned herald that a major cinematic director, with a distinct and greatly entertaining aesthetics adorned by his music flair, is in the offing in the land of L.A..Last but definitely not the least, how can one not praise for the silent epilogue in the end, Chazelle soberly let audience get a view of what would happen to the perfect-matched couple if they were living in an ideal Hollywood fairy-tale, but reality, in most times, is a far cry from fairy-tale, we have to move on without our perfect-half, but that is not to say, life will be miserable or intolerable, thanks to Chazelle's perspicuous vision, in a long run, we might be able to cherish the true happiness once we were fortunately bequeathed, and perhaps, it never leaves us, it always stay with us, to savor, to reminisce and to never give up our dreams.",9,64,119,7 September 2016

In order to maintain an orthodox balance between a summer blockbuster family film and an Alien-like horror-fest, the film consummates a relatively shrewd paradigm (a PG-13 rating is well-suited): you will never witness the ugly facade of the monster until the acme moment and it is certainly not scary; no blood will be splattered (the only exception is literally fake blood); no children and animals will be dispatched on the scene, in spite of a seemingly hyper-perilous train-wreckage, while grownups are trashily disposable (under one condition is that as long as there are no actual slaughter shots); the mass-killing is all behind the scene and the sudden seizure tactic has been exerted a dozen of times, which is considered as irksome thanks to a wonderful young cast for their endeavor to make the scene credible. Plot-wise, the film obviously suffers from some plausible expositions, the latter part of the film comparatively passes by hastily, The 'communication with the creature' and the pinnacle 'magnetic muster' scenes are too much similar and not original, what's more all is done on the spur of the moment, which bugs me whether J.J's inspiration well has running out of fuel? I'm still anticipating his new Star Trek project next year!But overall, I do enjoy the film quite a lot, first the CGI effects are marvelous even watching on a television screen, and the young cast, I'm name-checking the lead boy Joel Courtney (the boy's eyes can talk!) and another Fanning girl, Elle Fanning (a stunning monodrama presentation in the film and she is only 13 at that time), by far they are the best children performances I have seen for years among mainstream Hollywood films (along with Hit-girl in KICK-ASS 2010).",7,2,3,5 December 2011
3 Idiots," 3 Idiots
","First of all, I rarely watch Indian films; secondly, I think this highly-praised Indian film is overrated. There is no doubt this film is a quite entertaining one, but nearly nothing special is worth mentioning here, one can easily feel that the director exaggerate to stuff all kinds of popular elements in its 160 minutes (I like the songs though), universities' educational method, the genuine friendship, money is not the most important item in the world (don't marry an over-materialized man), a choice between what I want to do and what parents want me to do, blah blah blah....The film deals with a quite grand topic, the meaning of life, and luckily its scholastic didactics has not reached my threshold of intolerance, as a result I enjoyed most of its screen time, however, my absent-mindedness did come forth several times. Actually the general principles which the film tried so hard to convey are conventional, everybody knows, what the film achieved is to manifest it in a perfect cinematographic world where everything is too idealized to happen in our mundane world. Lack of empathy and a shoddy script makes the film fade like a forgettable fairytale.All the characters are stereotyped, the suspenses do not persist long enough and the whole film is skimpy of plausible explanations for most its plots. Still I give a 6/10, an eligible rate, thanks to Aamir Khan's lovable performance. I don't think the film represents the highest standard of contemporary Indian films, nevertheless the inconvenient truth is that it failed to encourage me to watch more Indian films at the same time, what else can I do? There are numerous films are waiting in lines for me to watch, I don't want to waste my very limited time.",6,10,27,6 January 2011
Woman in Gold," an uninspired hack job with an industrially designed wrapping can appeal to the lowest common denominator
","The real story itself has every aspect to be an uplifting material for a big screen adaptation, the Republic of Austria v. Altmann case, the righteous Jewish octogenarian Maria Altmann (Mirren) against the acquisitive Austrian government machinery, for the right of Gustav Klimt's $135 million worth painting Woman in Gold, where Maria's aunt Adele (Traue) is the said woman, and as a refugee fled from her homeland under the persecution of Nazis half a century ago, Maria has every right to get what belongs to her family and at the same time, to make peace with the mixed feeling towards her native land. But when $135 million is at stake, the story itself cannot dodge a cynic suspicion of how lofty the cause is, as Maria's lawyer Randy Schoenberg (Reynolds), a fellow Austrian descendant, the grandson of the well-known composer Arnold Schoenberg, ruefully admits in the middle section of the movie to his wife Pam (Holmes), he takes on the case for the sake of money, only later he becomes a more persistent driving force for the case when his personal connection with the cause being vicariously activated through this tough journey. But for Maria, screenwriter Alexi Kaye Campbell doesn't budge an inch on her integrity, although the aftermath is that the painting is geographically relocated from a museum in Vienna to another museum in New York City, while Maria earns a ginormous fortune by selling it, instead of keeping it as a personal treasure. No one should blame her since if that windfall befalls on any of us, we will most likely make the same decision under the circumstance, but a tangy odour of whitewash is frustrating and bothersome as a default blemish for the hagiography genre, not to mention a self-boosting chauvinism does't help either. Overtly this film resembles another Dame star vehicle PHILOMENA (2013), both fare quite healthy in the box office, which means this sub-genre does have its potential ticket-buyers, but as a Weinstein project, I doubt WOMAN IN GOLD will have any weighty influence on the Oscar race like the Dench-Coogan pic. First of all, the odd pair of Mirren and Reynolds doesn't register a tangible bond with humour and warmth which actually is so adroitly exerted by Dench and Coogan. Dame Mirren shines in a dignified impression which has no fault to pick albeit the character itself is flatter than we imagined. Reynolds acts up in several emotion-emancipating scenes, but overall, too hammy to take it in. Also, PHILOMENA is a more personal rite-of-passage of finding forgiveness in the most atrocious activity can ever incur on oneself, while WOMEN IN GOLD is more or less bordering on an ostentatious smash which panders to the audience stateside.One surprising discovery is Tatiana Maslany, who plays the young Maria, and the star of the cult show ORPHAN BLACK. She is the saving grace in my opinion and authentically a leading lady material, also Antje Traue is a stunner in this generically mass-catering flick, director Simon Curtis' follow-up of his overvalued Oscar-player MY WEEK WITH MARILYN (2011) is acceptably on a par with his predecessor, it can woo you instantly on the garish face value, but afterwards, it is just an uninspired hack job with an industrially designed wrapping can appeal to the lowest common denominator.",6,2,4,18 July 2015
Rio," Rio
","This Blue-Sky studio animation is a genuine energizer for the spring time here in Shanghai, saw the 3D-version in the cinema and even one week before its northern America release. The fun is literally tangible, although the whole story is a standard mainstream Hollywood product, the twist-and-turn is perfectly calculated to meet the expectations of both children and adult audience, which sadly enough though, also means that it is too naive to believe in something surprisingly overjoyed would occur. There is no doubt this one will grab tons of money in the market and further set up a great mouth-of-praise for Blue-sky Studio and shows the world beside ICE AGE franchise, they are truly capable of being a potential competitor of Pixar. The 3D effect is more like an appendix due to the fact that the all the adorable characters alone is sufficient to keep us embedded in our seats for a fleeting 90 minutes, the Rio de Janeiro location and Carnival also help to relish the whole process. The voice cast is superb especially Jesse Eisenberg, his distinctively geeky register and drumfire speed is the highlight, by comparison, Anne Hathaway's tone is nothing particular, sidekicks Will i Am and Jamie Foxx attribute their competent effort in rapping and singing respectively. I call it an almost-perfect-manufactured animation, however, RIO is not valiant enough to bring any groundbreaking revolution into the status-quo (as it had the chance to do so), for example, eventually our unusual non-flying macaw Blu has to accomplish the final rescue of his apple-of-the-eye by taking his first flying and the epiphany comes just on time! Why not keep Blu as a unique as he is? You don't need to do anything to prove to be who you are, right? Because you are who you are! So for me the most memorable quote in the film is I HATE SAMBA, BECAUSE THEY ALL SOUND SAME TO ME! This is golden, I wish I could iterate the same thing about nowadays mainstream films.",8,2,4,16 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," How To Train Your Dragon
","It's a huge pity that I didn't watch this cute animated film on 3D, otherwise there would be a big possibility that I will give it a 9/10. After many years of the predominance by Disney- Pixar, this time Dreamworks strikes back to overthrow its throne, however, as I haven't seen TOY STORY 3 (2010) yet (It might be hard to believe, I haven't watched any of TOY STORY franchise), I cannot judge if HTTYD could win the BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM over from TS3 in the coming Oscar, yet I will feel very much pleased if it happens. Without a raft of vulgar jokes, the film takes a firm stand to satisfy both children and adult demography with a meaningful storyline and some eye-dropping special effects. The designs of different kinds of adorable dragons can easily catch kids' heart, and the clever move of nerd-become-hero plot is ace in the hole to attract older youngsters, moreover, the excellent mouth-to-mouth reputation does surely allure a much wider audience range. The score is another great achievement, perfectly connects with the whole film and add more relish to it, which has earned the film another nomination this year. As for the cast, Jay Baruchel sounds much better in a cartoon than any other films he has made, Gerard Butler's strange accent makes up for his slightly boring character as our protagonist's Viking father. If I must pick some bones, I would say as much fun as I am getting from the film, the secondary characters fail to shine, all other kids didn't endow me with any vivid impressions even though they are voice-casted by Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. The film set another criterion to the up-coming animated features from all Hollywood film studios, I just pray that imagination will never die.",8,0,0,22 February 2011
Rocky," Another Oscar Best Picture winner to tick off any so-called cinephile's watchlist
","Another Oscar Best Picture winner to tick off any so-called cinephile's watchlist, like the titular no-name boxer which would become his most iconic screen image, Sylvester Stallone's career skyrockets after his wholesome, heartily-committed turn in John G. Avildsen's ROCKY, for which he also moonlights as the sole scribe, with both his script and leading performance are Oscar nominated, which catapults him among the rarefied company of Orson Welles and Charles Chaplin, the triumvirate who has yet achieved that exceptional feat in Oscar's history, although time has proven Stallone is a somewhat overachiever standing side by side with those two cinematic giants....continue to read my review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8,0,0,13 July 2019
Beauty and the Beast," A fair fairy-tale with mass appeal
","'Would you love a monster?', has become an increasingly moot question in our age branded by individualism and non-conformist viewpoint, so the answer would be: you betcha! How cool can be to tame a beast like that? Not to mention, his monstrous front aside, there nestling a genuine prince inside, that's a bonus!This Disney live-action revamp of the classic fairy-tale, directed by the workmanlike Bill Condon (DREAMGIRLS 2006 and TWILIGHT franchise, with occasional curve-ball GODS AND MONSTERS 1998), clings firmly to its 1991 animation in its storyboard and iconic songs, rendered altogether with a grandiose flourish could run rings around Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella (2015).The preamble musters efficiency and glimpses of royal pageantry with a more plausible premise (in the realm of magic, sky is the limit), a selfish prince (Steven) is transformed into a monster (and his servants into a clutter of objects) by an enchantress (Morahan), he must learn to truly love someone and get the reciprocal affection before time is running out, otherwise, him along with his hapless underlings will lose humanity for keeps. Then the narrative introduces our heroine Belle (Watson), a French village girl, who has a yen for reading and is an inventor herself (both are inadvisable hobbyhorses for womenfolk strait-jacketed by macho insularity), she is relentlessly pursued by Gaston (Evans), a bumptious village war-hero who doesn't take no for an answer. When Belle's father Maurice (Kline) is interned in the monster's castle for stealing a rose (a gift under Belle's request), Belle trades herself for her father, and inevitably develops a quasi- Stockholm syndrome to her captor (with the benevolent prodding from those anthropomorphic knick-knacks, among which a motormouth Ewan McGregor revels in sporting a wavering French accent as a candelabra). But when an exasperated Gaston knows about the existence of the monster, he convenes the village mob to assail the castle, there will only be one man standing between him and the monster, Belle is entangled in the scramble, but her feels powerless to stop the inevitable, until, yes, the magic moment after a poignant humanity-dissipating corollary. What a volatile enchantress! The upgraded musical numbers are meat and potatoes to the allure of the film, highlights are BE OUR GUEST (a cynosure garnished with the most deliriously enchanting special effects), GASTON (Evans is so close to snag that Hollywood leading man status for a voluntarily outed gay actor) and Emma Thompson's rendition of the theme song, a balm to one's ears, it is beggar belief that she hasn't been cast in a musical before!Acting wise, the film is a bog-standard family friendly fare demands nothing taxing for its stellar cast, Watson is presentable but far from impressive, Stevens is understandably curbed by his overwhelming costume, even his voice is muffled as if emanated from a mask, only Josh Gad's LeFou adds a nice (but overtly praised) touch of gay inclusivity.Disney's gargantuan ambition of transposing their animation repertoire into live-action by virtue of technique advancement, has been in full swing and proved to be not only viable but also massively lucrative, the only gripe is they could be more gallant in its story-telling (different angles, re- interpretation, reflecting current perspective, et al.), but at the same time, one cannot help but wondering does this trend flag up an overlooking threat to the popularity of animation filmmaking, a food for thought - when CGI anthropomorphism can seamlessly meet the demands, what will audience (in particular, grownups) prefer, a more realistic context or a self-conscious other-worldly dimension?",7,1,5,25 March 2017
Sicario," a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew
","The premise of Denis Villeneuve's latest picture SICARIO sounds like a top-form police procedural, a CIA elite squad vs. a Mexican drug cartel, Emily Blunt plays Kate, acts a surrogate for audience, who is an FBI SWAT agent, wide-eyed but enterprising in her field of work, volunteers to join the special division, lead by Matt Graver (Brolin), to track down the big boss behind the cartel in Mexico. But as the film explains in its first scene, SICARIO means hit-man in Spanish, so who is this hit-man? This is a vital question.We faithfully empathises Kate's perplexity as the mission goes on, where she begins to question the unorthodox method of Matt and Alejandro (del Toro), Matt's partner, and is constantly aggravated by being kept in the dark about their black ops. But the whole process will eventually evolve into a shock treatment for her idealistic faith, what behind the whole plan is beyond her widest imagination and comprehension, after being nearly strangled to death, shot by her own people and hectored to sign her signature to approve something sheer against her principle, until her final scene, a silent capitulation aptly and soundingly strikes the bull's-eye, a tough lesson about the unapologetic nihilism of our present society, which very likely is also the inconvenient truth. Emily Blunt pluckily takes up the gauntlet to challenge the glass ceiling, materialises as a tower of strength in this men's business, a tragic heroine, solemnly stomaches a nasty reality check.Josh Brolin plays in his comfort zone with his craftiness and insolence, whose opportunistic characteristic positions Matt's seemingly-righteous m√©tier in a grey zone. But the film's MVP title unequivocally belongs to del Toro's Alejandro, stuns with his all-out reserved gravitas and a steely resolution for retribution, gradually reveals his true colours as a cut-throat angel-of-death and a proficient marksman in the third act (he is the said hit-man we are looking for), leads towards a series breathless encounters with the wrongdoers of the drug ring and an ultimate face-to-face with Kate, he is the most chilling character on screen after Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007), if ever the movie will collect any Oscar love in the acting branch, he is the most entitled one.After his Hollywood one-two punch PRISONERS (2013) and ENEMY (2013), Villeneuve's directorial finesse again being appraised here, and he is such a first-rate ambiance deviser, together with the assistance of J√≥hann J√≥hannsson's stirring score, the thumping drumbeat in the opening is so palpable to set the mood upon that right vibe, yet, Villenueve knows the boundary, he doesn't overly resort to shock value to keep audience on the edge of the seat, which is brilliantly testified by the opening gambit with exchanges of fire, sudden explosion and ghastly cadavers. In a much wiser strategy, he makes good use of DP Deakins' majestic camera-work to varnish the film with a sublime tinge of poise and magnificence, like the breathtaking aerial shots, striking environmental palettes or the novel usages of thermal vision and night vision frames, they are where cinema finds its most glorious and enthralling achievement, a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew, soon he will become a juggernaut in the Hollywood industry, and his next project on the slate is the long-waited sequel of BLADE RUNNER (1982), since it might actually be the rare kind that does not sully its predecessor's reputation, shall we all drink to that?",8,21,32,24 December 2015
Some Like It Hot," Some Like It Hot
","It is quite an eye-opener for me to acquire that such a contentious sex-metamorphosis paranoia film could be made more than 50 years ago for the mainstream audience by the renowned Hollywood tycoon Billy Wilder, also sad to say, half century has elapsed, the evolution of mankind seems to be stuck in a halted mode. Certainly the film must be a comedy, which Billy Wilder is the virtuoso, the story is designed with scrupulosity, the set of the two pairs exudes some wonderful chemistry, for instance, which is vividly showcased by the parallel scenes of furthering their relationships respectively in the middle of the film. All the gags work swiftly and suitably at their occasions, the villain side was weakened to the lowest amount lest it would intrigue the audience a way too violent imagination, the 'spat' stunt alone is capable of making the aftershock of the blood splattering all on the screen wane. The truly hero of the cast is Jack Lemmon without any doubt as Tony Curtis' role falls flat and Marilyn Monroe was definitely not at her best moment (even arguably her worst), Jack single- handedly distinguishes himself with his quirky accent and exquisite lady-gestures, I could never imagine he was able to act as a woman with such an extended plausibility!I haven't watched too many Marilyn Monroe's films, still, her pitiable role as a typical halfwitted blonde in the film interconnects her real life status, which could only leave me some earnest sorrow and compassion to her, and then it spontaneously coordinates flawlessly with the pitch of her role in the film, eventually it renders me an even stronger appreciation toward the film itself, which I bet Billy Wilder would never expected! One little complaint is the ending seems too hasty although leaving us the popular wisecrack WELL, NOBODY IS PERFECT. I wonder how come there has been no sequel or remake of this masterpiece, which will serve as a timely final straw to this era, where the comedy sector has never been so barren and vapid as now.",9,1,3,11 May 2011
Les Mis√©rables," Les Miserables
","A full-house weekend cinema viewing, maybe a second-row syndrome which left my anticipation unfulfilled. First of all, I never successfully accustomed to the 'all sung script'bravura which blatantly dissolved the narrative into a mess of inconsistent singing ballyhoo, yes, I aware it is a musical film, but the semi-sing,semi-speak preposterousness is so distracting as if we were watching aliens perform their own performing art, a dreadful insouciant nonchalance has penetrated from the beginning to the very end. Secondly, the singing expertise from the cast is uneven, I don't intend to name the black sheep here, just wonder what's the advantage of adapting a musical into a feature film if the latter's voice prowess cannot keep in the same level albeit putting money to create more detailed settings instead of simple tableaux on the stage. There must be some artistic reasons behind but for the profitable perspective with exponentially-surging attendance. I may opt for a stage musical against my film aficionado predilection. Special congratulations to Anne Hathaway and Samantha Barks, their solo renditions alone are worth the ticket (maybe a soundtrack is more felicitous), Hathaway will 99% sure win her first Oscar, and she should perform in the upcoming Grammy awards as well. Barks is a new- found gem, but whether or not she can leap into a stardom out of the genre is a moot. Hugh Jackman finally gets his hard-earned Oscar nomination, but impaired by the sketchy and episodic storytelling, it is far from an award-worthy leading performance. Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried are adequate, while Helena and Sacha pair engenders a Burton-esque high spirit to offset the dreary misery and wide-eyed revolutionist mirage. Fairly speaking, Tom Hooper's workmanship doesn't generate too much excitement, starts with his shaky camera, eerie and undetermined, the CGI surroundings can hardly be called innovative, as an Oscar-winning director, his unjust fluke will sooner or later boomerang on his own luck.Sorry for grudging all over the place, I am pining for some involving lifelike revelations, clearly I am pigeonholing myself into the wrong consumer coterie, or simply don't watch it in the second row.",6,1,3,6 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves
","All psyched up to the forthcoming AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, there is some missing link for this reviewer to catch up on, James Gunn's Vol.2 of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, the most retro-kaleidoscopic, and least geocentric Marvel enterprise, is a tremendously gladsome popcorn escapade amped up its predecessor's winning formula.The grand design is Peter Quill aka. Star-Lord (Pratt, whose less tested dramatic aptitude catches up with him when the crunch arrives, pales into playacting compared to Robert Downey Jr., with whom he shares a similar rakish flair in the MCU) to discover his demi-god (with a minuscule 'g' for the sake of humility) origin and comes to terms with his 'daddy issues' heightened by a doughty bereavement, thankfully, the rest of the pack is exuberantly driven by rah-rah and esprit de corps, the plot cunningly divvies up some unfinished/new business for them to resolve: the flickering romance between Peter and Gamora (Saldanna); Nebula (Gillan) and Gamora's sibling conciliation; Drax the Destroyer (Bautista)'s bantering with a new member Mantis (Klementieff), a maladroit alien empath; Rocket (voiced by Cooper) gangs up with an unexpected ally, Yondu Udonta (Rooker), exiled by the Ravagers league, experiencing a foes-to-friends rapport, among others. The most thankless designation is as always, its antagonist, which falls on the shoulders of Kurt Russell's Ego, the living planet, an idea ingeniously derived from the Boltzmann brain, who is Peter's biological father, but his transcendence cannot mask the egocentric, self-centered, callous timber befitting a lonesome demiurge, imperiled by immortality and a dearth of empathy, and some infelicity (why slipping up the real cause of death of Peter's mother when you try so eager to get him on board?).A new eclectic compilation mixtape of vintage hits is par for the course, and is set into motion to garnish the action set pieces right from its ingenious opening, which leaves the monster-battling clich√© in the periphery and allows a capering Baby Groot (voiced by Diesel) to melt our hearts instead; a mid-point highlight comes with Yondu's dazzling whistle-arrow massacre, which splendidly wields its visual √©lan to tone down the scene's grimness; and in the end, it is in the company of Cat Stevens' FATHER AND SON, that the film reaches its emotional crescendo of both sadness and elation, Rooker is terrific in Yondo's hard-earned send-off.A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves, consolidates James Dunn's resolution of doing something dissimilar from other more earthbound MCU juggernauts and prior space opera paragons, a franchise finally merits its fanboy's hot-to-trot anticipation.",7,2,2,17 April 2018
Titanic," Titanic
","To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell). The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot. To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives.",9,4,6,3 October 2012
Thor," Thor
","I don't know it is only in China or not, the English version is 2D only here, the 3D version is exclusively Chinese-dubbed, I cannot figure out whether this maneuver is supposed to promote the 3D or 2D (a quite stupid one though), but I had no hesitation to choose the non- dubbed version (latter I would got some delightful news that the so-called 3D version is not worth the pennies). As the starter of the summer Hollywood blockbusters here in China, Thor intricately possesses a singular trait, the actor-turned-director Kenneth Branagh had remained to be an odd option since he was announced as the man behind-the-wheel the this heavy-budgeted vehicle for all cinephiles. How the Shakespeare-addicted Kenneth could on earth create a marvel-labelled popcorn picture? Now the wait is officially over, I must say the outcome of this incompatible combo tastes quite bland.Compared with other superhero-studded peers, Thor does look a bit shabby, the setting of the land of all Gods is mainly covered in a monochrome dark hue, which is nothing near splendid and in lack of any virtual existence, lavish but kitsch (3D glasses also cannot help). The earth set, on the other hand, the seediness is ubiquitously, no spectacular scene to satisfy my eyes, everything happens in a tiny desert town with a dozen of extras, running and screaming.The essential bedrock of the film centers on the father-son battle, which is Kenneth's stunt, but in a cartoonish way unfortunately, Kenneth may have exerted himself fully to balance the duel between money and art, however, in my opinion, he failed to achieve both.As for the cast, Just as I expected, nothing noteworthy, the only two exceptions, alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins is Tom Hiddleston, who unexpectedly devoted a feminine but not campy existence as the villain Loki, however, this film surely doesn't worth their talent. (Sorry, but I am intentional to leave out the new Oscar winner Natalie Portman here, I find her part might be the weakest amongst all).",5,2,4,18 May 2011
The Shape of Water," a hymn to all the 'incomplete' individuals, never despair, never give up hope
","'Incomplete' sounds like the operative word in Guillermo del Toro's inter-specie romance/fairy-story THE SHAPE OF WATER, headlining this year's Oscar game with a whopping 13 nominations. A mute janitor Elisa Esposito (Hawkins) working at a secret USA government laboratory in Baltimore develops a cordially mutual bond with an amphibian humanoid (Doug Jones, once again, nimbly embodies del Toro's monster under its spectacular camouflage), the sense of 'completion' is hinted by Elisa's gill-shaped scar on her neck, indicating that there must be an uncanny connection between them, and she must carry out a derring-do to rescue the creature from an imminent vivisection consented by the evil Colonel Richard Strickland (Shannon), yet, even if her plan works, is there a happy-ever-after waiting for the star-crossed lovers in the outside world? Opening the film with a stunning underwater showpiece of Elisa's water-submersed apartment through the voice of Gilles (Jenkins), Elisa's next-door-neighbor, a gay advertisement illustrator who becomes a father figure to her, del Toro cogently calibrates the story's fantastic texture right at the point of departure, and we are completely ensorcelled by his exhaustively fabricated 1960s' retro setting, tints of glaucous green, sapphire blue and subdued amber, adorned by Alexandre Desplat's euphonious tuneage and eclectic ditties. If the story doesn't pan out as revelatory as one might anticipate, what del Toro and his co-writer Vanessa Taylor excel in is the conscientiously integrated signs of the times, Elisa, her co-worker Zelda (Spencer), Gilles and Dr. Robert Hoffstetler (Stunhbarg), a Soviet Union mole who steps up as an unlikely aide to Elisa when the crunch comes, they are characters living on the fringe of the society, their skin-color, sexual orientation, gender, vocation or parentage subjects them as the victim of racism, sexism, homophobia, cold war paranoia (destroy the asset so that the enemy can not acquire it as well) and treachery. Applying an unequivocal angel-and-demon dichotomy, the film establishes Col. Strickland as the superlative villain, living his American dream of suburban complacency and hooked by capitalistic consumerism, he will stop at nothing in finishing his job, and Michael Shannon's go-for-broke incarnation of intimidation is non-pareil, it is rather telling that his performance is left mostly unheralded in the awards season, which prompts Richard Jenkins as the MVP amongst the sterling triad of supporting male performers to receive Oscar's recognition, a similar feat when Shannon himself usurped his co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson to swoop an Oscar nomination in Tom Ford's NOCTURNAL ANIMALS (2016), clearly, the current trend among the Academy members is good guys over sleazebags, which shouldn't be construed as a deprecated remark on Jenkins' affable, nuanced and constantly heart-felt performance. Ineluctably, de Toro pulls no punches in the token victim succumb to the sinister milieu, although violence has been well tempered along the road, Michael Stuhlbarg steals our hearts in his wondrous transmitting of trepidation and pathos. In the distaff front, Octavia Spencer pulls off an almost unrivaled record as an Oscar-winner bagging a third Oscar nomination in the supporting category (a recent predecessor could be Jason Robards), her Zelda might be just as well snatched from THE HELP (2011), but her earthy effulgence and earnestness are what connect and engage audience. The biggest asset, is of course, Sally Hawkins, deprived of verbal capacity (except for a singing-and-dancing, beauty-and-beast-esque, monochromatic figment of Elisa's imagination), whose expressiveness lurks unassumingly in every shot whether she is gesticulating along either Zelda or Gilles, reveling in her own fantasy or intimacy, or simply brazening out the mounting adversity with grace and valor.A fluidly bewitching, incredibly poetic tall-tale del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER might seem to be hemmed in its conventional narrative structure with every and each turn running to pedestrian, but in its heart of hearts, it sings a hymn to all the 'incomplete' individuals, never despair, never give up hope.",8,24,43,28 February 2018

He finished her last will to complete her unfinished novel.In his wife's unfinished novel, She was the ancient Queen of Spain and he was her most loyal fighter, he was assigned to find the immortal tree for her but finished by becoming the green grass and melting into the ground around the tree.In another unknown space and time, he was an abbe with piety, he accompanied with the immortal tree and they were in a flying bubble which aimed to the dying star to pursue immortality. And in the end the tree diminished while he realized the insight of eternity.The storyline seems simple but difficult to have apperception of the symbolic and metaphorical notion especially for the third story. It's a way too big proposition, it's nearly beyond the essence of life and death, it questions the whole universe of entity. This film needs to be watched several times and we will gain different comprehension each time. I will watch it again and to feel the distinctness in the future.The visual effect is astonishing in spite of the budget shrink, and I'm very impressed to wise up that Darren did not use CG technology for the film, I have no idea how he made it, and it's totally beyond my thought.Probably a lot of people think this film is obscure and difficult to perceive, I do adore this feeling, we have to think or even use imagination upon problems like that and it is in urgent need for cinephiles.I am deeply touched by Hugh Jackman's acting in this film, so heartbreaking and emotional, I think his wife is the happiest person in the world because she owns a purest, sincerest love from him. It's such a pity that Hugh's marvelous performance is largely overlooked last year just because this is a Sci-Fi movie. Rachel Weisz emanates a peculiar temperament in her roles, She is amazing too.I can never forget the mark of the ring mixed by blood and ink around the doctor's finger, it proves that even we, human beings are insignificant dust of the universe we can still create eternity of our own.",8,3,6,24 June 2007
Psycho," Psycho
","An untainted masterpiece, Hitchcock proves superbly that he had no impediments to conjure a classic B-movie like other lionized names like Roger Corman, George A. Romero and Russ Meyer etc., and all the more, he could outshine them by a notch.The film is an authentic template of a first-rate thriller/horror opus, which I will not bother to outline the details (for instance the over-examined bathroom slaughter scene) inasmuch as there are a wealth of professional dissertations everywhere in the digital era. I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years. The performance is uneven, in spite of the fact that the film earned the one-and-only BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Oscar nomination for Janet Leigh (which sounds not equivalent to her monumental fame though), a leading-actress-goes-supporting set-up was an unanticipated stunt for its audience at that time, which is rarely seen presently. Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's 'actor equals animal' methodology, they are more like props than real flesh. Arguably this is my favorite Hitchcock's film right now, I think only VERTIGO (1958) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) might have the chance to overthrow it from the throne. I know it is definitely my fault and I still don't figure out how could I miss this two. P.S.: The top-notch status of the film intrigued a faithfully-copied remake by Gus Van Sant in 1998, whose ill-fated destination was preordained, which I am quite interested in as well after watching this original work.",9,0,0,3 May 2011
The Witch," THE WITCH disgorges a deferential awe to the mysticism and regards our human folly with a cold glare
","'In the thick of its blame-throwing, hallucination-effecting, sin-confessing chaos, all hell breaks loose with predictable outcomes, sinners must pay for their sins, whether it is pride or wrath, and Thomasin, ever elfin and dainty as a wide-eyed hare, eventually confirms our trepidation when she signs a book with the devil and eventually relishes in a witches' sabbath. Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation who abandons herself to the rawest emotional states, while the close-knit cast is overall impressive, Ralph Ineson is alternatively sympathetic and antipathetic (when the Electra complex gives way to entrenched oscillation) as the beleaguered breadwinner, a gaunt-looking Kate Dickie stands out from the crowd as a tremendous force of grief, ire and desolation, by the same token, child actor Harvey Scrimshaw might touch on overacting in his final emotive outpouring of demonic possession.'read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",8,0,1,29 January 2020
The Holiday," The Holiday - Just a romantic dream
","When wrinkles are crawling on Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet's canthuses and Jude Law's hair is going to be like 'mediterranean sea', it all proves that I'm not used to the Hollywood's romantic comedies anymore. Maybe because I'm reaching an age that can have some immunity to these clich√© love story.This movie has a dream cast, although I think Kate and Jack are not quite match, Kate is goddess but Jack is always a typical clown in despite of he is quite charming in this film. But anyway his part is not that big so I can endure it.Still this is a typical Nancy Meyers's movie, I love 'Something's Gotta Give' and 'What Women Want', but this one is not as good as these two. The sparkle between main roles are not that amazing, and the plot line is all Nancy's wishful thinking, maybe romantic but no resonance here. Just for a holiday reason.Two women's exchange of their apartment, to taste different lifestyle and leave all the trouble behind. Great idea, I often dream about that. And meet some different persons there, have some fun, then turn back to the normal track, face the trouble and maybe it will not be trouble anymore.Kate and Cameron are very suitable for their roles, and it's a new attempt for Kate because she has little experience in this genre, she did a decent job, a lovable 'Bridget Jones', but far from excellent, she needs more practice. As for Cameron, she is on her way down now, losing her star-power day by day, the once highest-paid actress, does need a strong film to prove her ability, but not by this one. Her next project is Shrek 3 and no other new films. Quite an embarrassment for her.Love the cameo of Dustin Hoffman and Lindsay Lohan + James Franco's imaginary movie trailer, interesting!",6,2,4,5 April 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Unsung Heroes is Bigelow and Boal!
","A tit-for-tat vengeance it ostensibly acclaims, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a gritty, hard-boiled account of our anti-heroine Maya's relentless pursuit of Usama Bin Laden, and the most precious calibre of Kathryn Bigelow's latest film (after her precedent Oscar champion THE HURT LOCKER 2008, 8/10) is it soberly obviates any hyperbole which is attendant with its sensational thematic source. The film centers closely on Maya's perspective (excludes the last 30-minutes of re-enactment of the actual raid), the camera prowls around her, sifts meticulously her reflexes towards the mires she is engulfed with, meanwhile, Kathryn adopts a much daring path to categorically circumvents Maya's personal life and background foils, which inevitably will cause some unbecoming distance towards its core audience, but it does enhance a tincture of ceremonial sacrifice in her devotion, a fatalism glory in her trials and tribulations which can empathize in any other individual's own track of life. Standing firmly as an apolitical film fanatic, I could stay unruffled with its vexing 'torture' controversy because as it is mentioned in the film, 'it is just biology', the truth lies unscathed here and there no matter how we try to whitewash it, and it is extremely feasible to exert the extreme action under the extreme circumstances, the film really has some guts in not hedge the issue and instead, it emboldens us to question ourselves to face the darkest side of our humanity, Maya's gradual stolidness towards torture could be applied to anyone if facing a similar situation (there are profuse nefarious activities happening everyday everywhere). So a film should not be punished to reveal the ' inconvenient truth' which slams the hypocrisy of the ruling class, it is foreseeable that not everyone would be happy with the film, but what is the most quintessential conviction is that this sort of film should own its voice and place in the market and earn its appeal. Kathryn recruited most of her THE HURT LOCKER crew in this film, so the dusty texture, erratic camera-work, superb sound effect and visual blast are viscerally cogent. Jessica Chastain, whose excellency I may not repeat here, but her flair of arresting attention is inscrutably immense, even as plain as simple contemplation, she would blow you away. Her illustrious future is clearly beckoning and Meryl Streep can feel a sense of relief since finally there is someone who can suit her shoes, interestingly, it is the very much underused and under-appreciated actress Jennifer Ehle who resembles a staggering young Meryl Streep countenance in the film, and among a dozen of male ancillary roles, Jason Clarke should be honorably mentioned albeit his screen-time diminution in the latter half of the film does leave his Oscar-chance awry. The film altogether is more like a phlegmatic rumination of a persistence of what we believe than a panegyric for unsung heroes, it establishes its unyielding stance out of a presumed HOMELAND-esque political thriller pattern, personally it is that kind of film I admire more than I enjoy, and Ms. Bigelow and the screenwriter Mark Boal are the unsung heroes here.",8,1,5,13 March 2013
Steve Jobs," Fassbender fleshes out the mystery of Steve Jobs
","Title: Steve Jobs Year: 2015 Country: USA, UK Language: English Genre: Biography, Drama Director: Danny Boyle Writer: Aaron Sorkin based on the book of Walter Isaacson Music: Daniel Pemberton Cinematography: Alwin H. K√ºchler Cast: Michael Fassbender Kate Winslet Seth Rogen Jeff Daniels Katherine Waterston Michael Stuhlbarg Perla Haney-Jardine Ripley Sobo John Ortiz Sarah Snook Makenzie Moss Adam Shapiro Rating: 7.7/10A biography feature of the late Steve Jobs, scripted by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Danny Boyle, stretching from 1984 to 1998 and opens with Arthur C. Clarke's prescient interview about a personal computer in 1974, the film cleverly encapsulates the stories into three acts, all set minutes before the product launches: in 1984, Apple Macintosh, in 1988, NeXT computer and in 1998, iMac. Such a decision constructively shuns from the common default of the biographic genre, that is, ponderously chronicling a tedious running account of (significant) events in our protagonist's live, moreover, Boyle leavens the conflicts (both professional and personal) between Jobs (Fassbender) and various characters with Sorkin's trenchant script, creates riveting theatrics which more inclines to BIRDMAN (2014) than THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010).Admirably, this is no Jobs' cheap hagiography, in the first act, the very first scene, his tremendous self-will has started to get under one's skin, it is understandable gifted people might have conceit in themselves, but his egoistic and sadistic treatment towards Andy Hertzfeld (Stuhlbarg), a member of his team, is unapologetically offensive. Things are not helped by his flagrant denial of fatherhood to Lisa (played by Moss, Sobo and Haney-Jardine in 3 different ages), his daughter from ex-girlfriend Chrisann (Waterston), but what is the reason behind that denial? We might never know, although the film's depiction of Chrisann as a brazen money-exacting might betray something information, at any rate, she is not a role-model mother either.Other staples in the three acts (apart from Andy, Chrisann and Lisa) are Steve Wozniak (Rogen), his peer, co-founder of Apple, who is relentlessly begging Jobs to acknowledge the work of Apple II team in the launch, which Jobs unswervingly refuses simply because he is the conductor, and Apple II team is not a qualified musician in his orchestra deserves the plaudits, as plain as that. The next one is his boss John Sculley (Daniels), CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993, whose rapport with Jobs experiences a big turning point after Jobs being fired from Apple after the unsuccessful launch of Macintosh, he is a quasi-father figure to Jobs, with specific flashbacks to emphasise the key incidents between them; and last but not the least, Joanna Hoffman (Winslet), the marketing executive who stands by him all along the journey, she is the only one who can put some senses into Jobs' opinionated head, and becomes the bridge between him and others (friends or foes).Engaging and sparkling rival show between Fassbender and his co-stars, without relying too much on physical resemblance, Fassbender's Jobs is a flawed entrepreneur, a genius hampered by his personality, as he claims, he doesn't care whether to be liked or disliked by people around him, his only aim is to do the right thing, to create revolutionary products in the digital era and in fact he succeeded. Fassbender beautifully instils into his character with this sort of unsympathetic self- regard and skepticism, he taunts religion with his remark about God sending his only son to be sacrificed, yet, in the third act, the warmth of a bonding father-and-daughter cosily rounds up a content ending, blissfully, there is a learning curve for him through these years. There is literally no bones to pick in his immaculate embodiment of such an iconic figure, Steve Jobs is a person after all, when all the hales are evaporated, he is not the man in the machine.Winslet is gung-ho is her supporting turn, her Joanna completely orbits around Jobs and bespeaks of the purest friendship which a man and a woman can ever achieve, it is a heartening return to the accolades after years of nadir since her controversial Oscar win for THE READER (2008); Rogen and Daniels are also awards-worthy although apart from Fassbender and Winslet, the entire film (particularly Daniel Pemberton's magnificent score and Sorkin's dialogue-laden script) is under the radar of the past awards season after its disastrous box office performance last autumn.Reality distortion field, a term coined to describe the mixture of Job's personalities, which now has become a symbol of die-hard loyalty for Apple's products, which leads to a more existential question, why on earth we should be interested in Steve Jobs' personal crisis? The far more inspiring and illuminating parts are how he brings Apple company to its unprecedented fruition against all the setbacks and how they develop their groundbreaking OS and alas, as competent as Sorkin and Boyle, these are the blind spots they cannot offer to present, and rarely any biographical movies do.",8,0,0,8 March 2016
Crazy Heart," doesn't live up to all the accolade it has sparked
","Not everyone deserves a second chance, what do we see in Bad Blake (Bridges)? A 57-year-old scuzzy musician on the brink of bankruptcy, touring in small bowling alleys (hey! it is the Dude himself back in his favorite haunt) and bars to make ends meet, what is more pathetic, he is an inveterate alcoholic. But, he is a legend of his profession, though he has been on the downturn for too long and alcohol seriously bogs down his songwriting gift along with his health, now he basically banks on his old discography to attract his die-hard/desperate groupies and holds an invidious grudge towards his prot√©g√© Tommy Sweet (Farrell), who is the red-hot country star now, but becomes more and more independent from him.CRAZY HEART is Scott Cooper's debut film which finally won Jeff Bridges an Oscar more for his overdue status (5th time is the charm) than the calibre of the performance per se. There is no denying of the country-veteran finesse on stage from the musically inclined Bridges, which rightfully should also be obliged to a killing soundtrack cooked up by Mr. Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton. Mr. Bridges certainly goes out on a limb to make Bad Blake a thorough and convincing transformation from a down-and-out performer lolling in his dim motels watching Mexican soapie to a smitten soul resuscitated by a May-December romance with a young singer- mother-cum-journalist Jean Craddock (Gyllenhaal), we see him drinking, performing, vomiting, meeting-cute, touring with Sweet, parenting, drinking, panicking, repenting, drinking, vomiting until he passes out in his bathroom, then drying-out and finally he can write some new materials, the trajectory is ever-familiar, but proffers carte blanche for Mr. Bridges to rescue his character from his self-destructive morass and render as much sympathy as possible.But the plot takes some arbitrary licenses in their doomed romance, for instance, if one intends to blame Bad's alcoholism for the incident causes the riff between him and Jean, the approach should have been more specific, in lieu of simply making a toddler disappear even before Bad is visibly well-oiled, which seems to imply that Jean is over-reacting in the aftermath (because the scenario could happen to everyone other than those who are under the influence), to shift some burden from Bad's behavior to Jean, and harshly intimate that she might not be such a saintly savior as we see, albeit in our moral compass, whoever is brave enough to kiss that alcohol and smoke soused mouth, then subsequently falls in love with a character like Bad Blake, must be a self-sacrificing angel!Ms. Gyllenhaal usurps an Oscar nomination too, but her character is pigeonholed into a generic love interest slot, with no further delving into her psyche except for her overbearing maternal protection towards her son, also in the love-making shots, there are tangible awkwardness between her and Bridges, perhaps, both are too self-aware of their gaping age difference, against Cooper's conspicuous endeavor to project Jean in the centre during their making out, to pinpoint that she is literally enjoying the process, which only becomes embarrassingly risible, betrays a stinking whiff of self-boasting of a unpleasant, elder man's potency. Colin Farrell, during his limited screen-time, brings a breezy personality with his undisclosed singing bent, in a surprising way, his Tommy Sweet is not a blatant ingrate as we had anticipated (mostly influenced by Blake's steely taciturnity whenever his name pops up). At bottom, CRAZY HEART is a slightly above-par independent charmer, nevertheless doesn't live up to all the accolade it has sparked.",7,1,2,7 October 2016
Mudbound," MUDBOUND officially establishes Dee Rees as an unstoppable force to be reckoned with
","Topical epithets like 'African-American', 'female', 'lesbian' can immediately boost filmmaker Dee Rees as a shoo-in of any awards consideration to validate the industry's all-inclusivity dedication, but when MUDBOUND, her stirring second feature, misses both BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR nominations in the Oscar race, we can impute it to its bad luck, but never to the movie's artistry, as both Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig overshadow her with the same politically correct cards (race/gender) in the directorial category, and labelled as a Netflix movie, the film may have reached more audience but is also predisposed to be brushed aside by the old guards among the Academy members on the strength of safeguarding silver-screen's sacrosanct purity, albeit changing of the form is inexorable. Located in Mississippi during the 1940s, MUDBOUND traces relations between two families, the McAllans, two brothers Henry (Clarke) and Jamie (Hedlund), with Henry's wife Laura (Mulligan), their two young daughters and the brothers' father Pappy (Banks), who own a farm and the Jacksons, headed by Hap (Morgan), their tenant farmer, with wife Florence (J. Blige) and a brood of four. Both Jamie and Ronsel (Mitchell), Jackson's eldest son are recruited in the army to fight Nazis, the former is a bomber pilot and the latter on the ground, commands a tank in the Continent. It is their experiences in the war that brings them closer, after both are lucky enough to return home alive and kicking but find themselves beset by PTSD and wanting an aim in their post-war existence, their camaraderie will be tested in a nefarious lynch mob commotion in the climax, but salvation is well-earned with Dee Rees' conscientious endeavor, not least in her sterling aptitude of honing up an arresting narrative: horror and anguish are produced with frenetic editing in the under-lit condition, but never overstay their welcome, tendresse and pathos are dished out in apposite quotient without ever overstating their connotations. Told intermittently through 6 main characters' voice-overs, this tack refreshingly fleshes out each player to constitute a fantastic ensemble, every adult in the McAllans, represents one particular mindset towards the entrenched racism, from Pappy's Ku Klux Klan-infused abomination, Banks, who can chill you to the bone with just a glance, is one's worst nightmare in living embodiment, which should be taken as a sincere compliment; to Henry's matter-of-fact treatment and congenital superiority, being considerably less unbearable makes it a more insidious barrier to overtake; then there is Laura's moderate kindness and Jamie's genuine friendship, which regrettably are not out of sheer truism or sense of justice, but on the condition of reciprocation (Florence tends to Laura's daughters when they are sick, and Jamie's life is saved by a black fellow pilot), this faintly retrograde narrow-mindedness has become this reviewer's pet peeve whenever racism is tackled in a fictitious creation. Among its dramatis personae, R&B diva Mary J. Blige is the sole recipient of an Oscar nomination, her portrayal of Florence is palpably nuanced, composedly resilient and utterly lifelike (her proficiency of dispatching a rooster is very under-praised), not to mention with a puissant theme song MIGHT RIVER to render addition empathy during the closing credits (a double Oscar nominee this year). Carey Mulligan, on the other hand, is unfairly overlooked with her pitch-perfect incarnation of a neglected wife who is mired in a hopeless situation (her husband doesn't even ask her opinion about their life-changing relocation), not just by debasing her appearance, Laura is 'mud-bound' in the most literal way (ablutions conduces to her unsatisfied desire and liberation), like many women, she seizes her marriage as an escape of her spinsterhood, and has to live with the consequence to the boiling point, that incestuous impulse, it is not an easily legible role but Mulligan glows with assurance and true grit. On the masculine front, Jason Mitchell is the unequivocal one who rallies our sympathy and investment, which he runs way with in steadfast strides. Rob Morgan, also rounds out with a memorable impression as the undeterred paterfamilias, sticking to his guns within sagacious boundaries, as for Garrett Hedlund, who is tasked with the most thrilling retaliation in the form of patricide, is much as good as you want him to be, which leaves Jason Clarke takes the short end of the stick with a less showier part. It will be a great remiss to not mention that DP Rachel Morrison has become the first ever female Oscar nominee in that branch owing to her finesse of designing its period-saturated, umber-hued landscape, and grabbing 4 tickets to the Kodak theater, odds are not exactly favorable to MUDBOUND, but at the very least it competently establishes Dee Rees as an unstoppable force to be reckoned with, and spearheads a belatedly surge of (black) female filmmakers on the horizon.",8,1,6,7 February 2018
12 Years a Slave," a momentary film of our generation!
","It takes an emotional toll to watch Steve McQueen's poignant 2013 BEST PICTURE winner of the Academy awards, adapted from the autobiography of Solomon Northup, a free black man is sold into slavery for 12 years in the antebellum United States. As the third feature film from UK auteur Steve McQueen (after HUNGER 2008, 7/10 and SHAME 2011, 9/10), 12 YEARS A SLAVE is a metamorphic achievement for his director competence, comes to grips with the grave source material, and transposes the text into a visually stupefying and inwardly resounding piece of cinematic treasure, compels audience to vicariously undergo the trials and tribulations of Solomon (Ejiofor) and his fellow black slaves, and to corroborate us the price of freedom is hard-won merely 150 years ago, we might say we have far progressed above the stupidity and narrow-mindedness portrays among the white folks in the film, and slavery is rather an antiquated concept, however, whether this self-aware moral improvement has reached its end of line, or 150 years later, when we our progeny harks back, we will be plainly as anachronistic as those pathetic, barbarous and abominable predecessors. I digress too far, but I do intend to reiterate the value of this film, not because slavery is obsolete so we contemporaries have no urgency to watch it, in fact, we are in absolute obligation to reflect on those historic iniquity to alert ourselves not to recommit the same error, which we may agree, a large portion of people are treading the same water in the present climate. Now, back to the film, McQueen and his team, in particular the long-time DP Sean Bobbitt, are luxuriating in their meticulous composition of each shot, the long-shot of Solomon hung on a tree struggling to life with his toes tipped on the ground while no one care or dare to set him loose (in the background, several slave kids frolicking around) is strikingly daunting to behold, whether white or black, their mentality is ingrainedly impaired; intermittently, the breathtakingly picturesque topographic shots of the southern land (the bayou, the cotton field or the windy woods) seamlessly transition the chronicle into another twist or perturbation. The central dramatis personae is electrifying to the core, Ejiofor whole-heartedly radiates in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and every single take lingers on his bubble-eyed physiognomy is unimpeachably soul-stirring, his immaculate dedication oozes Solomon's despair, angst and persistence. Fassbender, McQueen's fixed leading man, lends himself to the meaty villain role, the outright racist plantation owner Edwin Epps,the dichotomy of his libido-driven infatuation with the young slave girl Patsey (Nyong'o) and the iron-clad truth she will never be completely his possession, is the centrepiece which culminates in an appalling whipping sequence where McQueen unbendingly fixates on Patsey's heartbreaking wail and the horrid lacerations, Nyong'o is no doubt meritorious for her Oscar-win with her debut, her final scene when seeing off Solomon to his freedom with both yearning (for herself) and felicity (for him) has been encapsulated with pitch perfect verisimilitude. Further on, besides those three Oscar-nominated lucky ones, it is a handful of under-praised but equally memorable performances, Sarah Paulson (Mistress Epps), Alfre Woodard (Mistress Shaw) and Adepero Oduye (Eliza) all steal the limelight when their meagre screen-time is on, Paulson is brilliant with her glacial frigidity and sharp callousness, Woodard nails the most ambiguous role in the film with her composed utterance and Oduye brings about a burst of volcanic theatricality in her t√™te-√†-t√™te with Ejiofor. By contrast, the other male side players are less prominent, Pitt is the ultimate messiah for Solomon, but reservedly underlit, and Paul Dano is on the verge of being typecast as someone either compulsively creepy or maddening annoying. John Ridley's stern screenplay (the third Oscar win for the film) prunes the prolonged odyssey into a number of key chapters, carves out a clarified narrative arc while enlivening the jaded souls with terse lines full of understated connotations; Hans Zimmer's score mingles with the movie's awe-inspiring presentation of a history should never be forgotten, tallies with the credence of viewers' spontaneity, unobtrusive, but superbly competent alongside this epic voyage, if you can stick to the very end, it is a film can sublimate your moral sentience, and Steve McQueen is a filmic wizard of sublime gravitas, at the age of 45, we can optimistically hope that his best has yet to come.",9,3,5,14 March 2014
Joker," JOKER is a marvel which should be righteously extolled and commended, if, that is to say, we live in a perfect world
","Asserting as a one-off enterprise from DC universe and starting the original story of Arthur Fleck aka. The Joker (Phoenix) in 1981, director Todd Phillips (hailed from the THE HANGOVER trilogy fame), first thing first, has done a mind-blowing job in exbibiting a tangible retro flair from the film's imposing set design, a refuse-ridden, duck egg blue-hued Gothom City where anarchy is brewing at every sleazy corner, in tandem with Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's forboding symphonic score, it set the film's overall unforgiving keynote up to the eleven. And JOKER's closest kindred spirit might rightly be Martin Scorsese's seminal work TAXI DRIVER (1976), with a knowing nod to THE KING OF COMEDY (1982), not least hinted by Robert De Niro's presence here, and it palpably belongs to the veritable 'true cinema' which Scorsese laments in his recent comments about DC's rival, Marvel's superhero movies.It is somewhat disconcerting (but not entirely unexpected) to learn Phillips' Venice Golden Lion winner is met with polarized reactions among critics stateside albeit being a legitimate box office leviathan by breaking all the October records in its opening week and audience simply adores it. Quite accountable, Phillips and his co-writer Scott Silver's script pluckily touches a raw nerve by lending an uncompromising view on the societal genesis of Arthur's violent predisposition - sowed by the disenfranchisement and impoverishment stonewalled by the plutocratic ruling class, represented by the future Batman's father Thomas Wayne (Cullen) and incited by the anomie and apathy Arthur faces on a daily basis....

The Bridge on the River Kwai," The defining piece among David Lean's magna opera
","The defining piece among David Lean's magna opera, THE BRIDHE ON THE RIVER KWAI ushers in Lean's artistically ripe years with his epic-scale storytelling coming about in the most picturesque locations among our mundane world. In the heart of its hearts, TBONRK is an anti-war infotainment, as it is book-ended by British Major Clipton's 'it's madness!' exclamation after its breakneck finale, madness is constituent of war, no one can say otherwise, but as in any superlative narrative-leaning cinematic conception, Lean cannily adopts an ambiguous route in lieu of stating the obvious (one must also lure those ticket-buyers who are steeped in nationalism, patriotism and heroism into the auditorium) and lets the rousing spirit prevail among those allied WWII POWs in Burma, under the high-handed command of Japanese Colonel Saito (an Oscar- nominated Hayakawa, giving a forcibly layered presence against the role's discriminated condition), to build a bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The meat of the film's first half is a duel of will between British Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Guinness, walks away with his Oscar with august poise and solemn diction) and Saito, and who is the winner? The answer is as plain as the nose on anyone's face. Nicholson's obduracy ostensibly stems from his admired patriotism, to safeguard the last remnant of dignity against the ghastly adversity, but there is just a fine line between patriotism and jingoism, he will not bat an eye if he dies for his alleged good cause, naturally, it entails that no other lives can alter his mind, and shall we really extol such hidebound doctrine? This is where the film daringly touches a raw nerve in Nicholson's final triumph, why is he hailed by his fellow prisoners? He has done nothing for them from a pragmatic angle, what he achieves only fulfills his ego, an ego Lean beguilingly links with British's own colonial pride, to build a sturdy bridge in a foreign country and have his name inscribed in the plaque, disregarding its utilitarian consequences which will further extend the warfare and compound the affliction. On the other hand, we have the American Navy Commander Shears (an omnipotently, effortlessly charismatic Holden), who miraculously escapes from the prison camp alive, and swears that nothing can haul him back to that living hell. But, 'there is always something unexpected', that is the tag-line of the picture, in the exchange between him and the British Major Warden (Jack Hawkins, spiking a dosage of empathy into his martinet blood), Shears is literally coerced into 'volunteer' the mission to blow up the bridge because of his inconvenient 'imposter' identity, yes, he is not a commander but a common soldier taking the uniform to secure better treatment in captivity (a very understandable action, surely is below Nicholson's hallowed principles). What happens in the second half actually shows that Shears' 'insider' distinction makes no import in their mission or whatsoever, the army might just as well command any soldier as willing as the Canadian Lieutenant Joyce (Horne, a tenderfoot but swell swimmer), there is cruel irony seeping underneath the shock troops' daredevil heroism. As a rule, the mockery shouldn't be too offensive (it is not a vehement agitprop), Shears' penchant for hedonism and pragmatism alternates with Nicholson slippery to self-indulging delusion is the constantly battling tenors thrusting this film to the crunch, as Nicholson's 'what have I done?' epiphany dished up with a ghost of vague contrition and followed by a chancy act of detonation, all we want to ask in the aftermath, is it really worth it?Apart from several peccadilloes, for instance, the technical incapacity of the Japanese party comes far too convenient (as it is not the case in reality) and the unpleasantness of war prisoners' state- of-play is categorically diluted, TBONRK is a sensational journey, peopled with vivid characters (its nearly male-exclusive cast, saving for some female exploitation footnotes, is all in full mettle), sublime landscape (including a striking worm's-eye view shot with collective wing-taking avifauna in the wake of gunshots) and well-imposed suspense, not to mention the food-for-thought deliberation it triggers in hindsight, one must see it to experience it!",8,2,3,13 November 2017

Basically the film is confined inside a mental institution, among a breed of patients, a newcomer McMurphy's arrival stirs Nurse Ratched's tyranny, whose strategy of manipulating those deranged is to coerce them into retread their horrible past and force them suffer under the name of group therapy, such a detestable character, Louise Fletcher nailed it, a borderline leading role, Fletcher's Oscar victory may raise some controversy, but her performance is impeccable in accentuating a devilish incarnation of obstinacy and ruthlessness. Nicholson won his first Oscar in his heyday, as McMurphy, a petty criminal has a sane mind, threatens the authorities as a black sheep in the group, whose devil-may-care boldness and utter naivety (assuming that the institution is a much better place than a prisoners' reforming farm) conflicts in the process of his freedom-seeking and his direct influence on other real mentally-impaired ward mates, ultimately, his tragedy is a boomerang to his gullibility and self-considered kindness, which squanders his best shot of escape and obliquely preconditions Billy's final breakdown. The ambivalence of McMurphy's heroic recklessness is the most intriguing topic of the film, he is not an amiable fellow, a ruffian on the street with a rebellious attitude, it is not in his intention to ameliorate his fellow mates' condition, his presence does not have an initiative motivation, what he does is his knee-jerking response of a living soul who hankers for an unsubdued environment which the society refuses to proffer. There are many political allusions can be extracted from the film, to which I shall not refer since I am no American and am unfamiliar with the history, but the film garners a great amount of impressive supporting performances, Dourif's big screen debut is stutteringly poignant, whose demise is a facile move in heightening the tension, but performance-wise, it is more awe- inspiring than the two leads aforementioned. Sampson, as the Chief, symbolizes the hope of the unsuppressed, his back-story is curtailed and his pretense has never been given a chance to be expounded. Two old-hand actors are surprisingly seen in this film when in their youth, a tough Lloyd and a meek DeVito, and many deceased names also, Crothers, Redfield and Lassick, the latter is another show-stealer, over-the-top but strikingly hilarious. Forman's preference over classical music also reflects in the film, the opening score from Jack Nitzsche hums along with a melancholic tone and the symphony-driven pieces are inserted into the right place at the right time. There are many memorable shots, e.g. Nicholson being electric-shocked and Fletcher being strangled are too authentic to stare, on the whole ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a sound accusation towards high-handed suppression and dominance, its sociological impact even rises above over the film's own integrity of a gem made with excellent cast and wry irony.",8,0,1,13 July 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," A satisfactory Sci-Fi film actually justifies itself
","Action-packed summer tent-poles continue with EDGE OF TOMORROW, Tom Cruise stars in this hardcore alien slasher (with an estimated exorbitant budget of $178,000,000), directed by THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002, 8/10) alum Doug Liman, although it has been dead on arrival in the domestic box office, Tom Cruise' more appealing international star-power can be the last straw to make the ends meet. Blatantly ripping of the time-loop concept from GROUNDHOG DAY (1993, 9/10) and SOURCE CODE (2011, 8/10) , the film craftily grafts it on a Sci-Fi battleground with Mimics, an alien species (with metal tentacles and high-speed mobility) invading the Mainland Europe, after his first-day in the front-line, rookie soldier Cage (Cruise) dies in a blast together with a giant blue Mimics (Alpha, one out of several millions), doused in its blood, he miraculously wakes up alive and kicking at the camp one day before, afterward, every time he dies, time jumps back to this exact same time slot and he gains experience while others are oblivious of all the happenings.So, there is a quite plausible explanation about this whimsical setting, after meeting a female warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt), who has undergone the same situation months earlier and been deprived of her ability after a blood transfusion, Cage sides with her to find out a way to destroy Omega, the highly-intelligent brain behind all the Mimics who can anticipate human race's every and each move because it has the ability to turn back time, whenever an Alpha one dies, time- loop is intrigued to revive it to a near time-line, by coincidence Cage is mistakenly resuscitated in light of covered with Alpha's blood, he becomes a surrogate of the Alpha he killed as far as in Omega's mindset, it all lies in the blood. After umpteen death (sometimes conducted by a cavalier Rita and teems with satisfactory gags here), Cage has evolved into a competent warrior and finally, they are on a one-last-chance journey (after Cage loses his ability too) to exterminate Omega under the Louvre Museum before the losing battle begins. Slyly imitating the WWII D-Day invasion, the movie is a rip-roaring riot with its fast-paced editing (cheap-looking CGI though, makes one wonder how do they spend all that money? Cruise's pocket, maybe), Cruise is always in his tiny hero mode although this time he starts as a total greenhorn, the opening two-hander between him and Brendan Gleeson (as General Brigham) is rib-tickling as though the hefty Brigham is going to personally teach Cage a lesson for being a smug business man who gets cold feet when coerced to enter the real battlefield. Emily Blunt (fresh from Rian Johnson's time-travel enterprise LOOPER 2012, 6/10) brings about a potent pulse as a bona-fide heroine, almost equally shares the save-the-world undertaking with Cruise, pitifully, the film is betting on Cruise's trademark, what would happen if it is Rita who drops the grenade near the coda? Maybe with a bit flashback of the expedition about how she finally cracks the time-loop theory in the first place. I cannot even imagine that, how awesome it would be! Anyway, the picture is compelling entertaining, with a sophisticated script behind to support its primary assumptions, with a video-game setting of immortality to pander to its core audience, and efficiently omits the tiresome context-supplement process every time Cage restarts his routine day. We can only blame Cruise's waning sway in North American for its lukewarm debut weekend, it is time to consider Blunt as an action lead and she will shine no matter what.",7,1,4,11 June 2014
Whiplash," A superb horror-drama and the year's best!
","Few might expect an indie drama about a dysfunctional mentor-student relationship about jazz-drum can be such a thrilling adrenaline drive, WHIPLASH, which not only proudly joins the elite top 8 in the upcoming Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees, but is also counted as a major contender in for a harvest (with J.K. Simmons indisputably has BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR in his bag). It is also hard to imagine this is only young director Damien Chazelle's second feature, after his less-seen debut GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH (2009), WHIPLASH is such a full-grown piece of gem, with the slithering camera movement, a plethora of intensive close-ups and snappy editing, a buzzy audio surrounding and the irresistible jazzy soundtrack, it engages us with a daunting study of the pursuit of being the greatest and a spellbinding and unblemished mental orgasm in its fierce solo-drum finale. Structurally the film is unsparing wrangle of dual dynamism between Andrew (Teller), a 19- year-old initiated into an eminent music school in New York and his instructor Terrence Fletcher (Simmons), whose method is unapologetically radical, he has a firm conviction that there is only one way to elicit a prodigy's true potential, which is through high-handed pressure and unyielding dismissal, 'good work' is the most vicious remark to nip a prospective genius in the bud, as the jazz titan Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker, if his tutor had not thrown a cymbal to him after a mediocre performance, he would not be the short-lived legend in the history of music (he died in the age of 34 and was a severe dug addict). Of course, his one-sided theory cannot convince all the audience, and the truth is, his famous Charlie Parker vignette is mistakenly conceived.However, Andrew is aspiring to become someone like Parker, he professes to prefer dying young but being one of the greatest to living a conventional life of longevity, so in some extent, they have a tacitly consensual sadomasochistic relation which they both need as a pivot, for Andrew, it is the external incentive he needs to push him to reach raw passion over pure skill, and more sinisterly is for Terrence, he is no way a selfless tutor, to find a talent like Andrew is the ultimate solution to fulfill his own recognition of his entire life, he does't have the potentiality, but he has the keen eyes to detect one, in the final act, Chazelle manifestly tears off Terrence's mask of sanctimony, lays bare the selfishly- motivated intention of retaliation, and the final twist is superlatively terrific, in one hand they both get what they want, but for viewers it is less uplifting than chilling to witness Andrew's transcendence, like in a horror fare, Andrew has to morphed into a monster in order to fight back another monster, if this is the only way to achieve the greatness, I will never second to that kind of atrocity, and greatness doesn't matter under this circumstance. Miles Teller is formidably stunning as Andrew, with extra credits given to his prowess as a supposedly talented drummer, fully shoulders on Andrew's rite-of-passage from a 'squeaker' to a full-charged powerhouse, not just with Terrence, where he never flinch, but also in the scenes with others, in particular during the sparse screen-time with his new girlfriend Nicole (Benoist), Teller's bent as a camera-friendly leading material does outstrip his relatively bland looks, it is a huge shame that he is not in the talk of Oscar-race for this outstanding performance. Yet again, the MVP is Simmons, his Terrence is a more intelligent and malevolent update of R. Lee Ermey's Sergeant Hartman in Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET (1987, 9/10), like a kicking time-bomb we never know when he will explode, even in his kindest moments, he is spine-chilling to behold from the protection of a screen, makes viewers wonder how can those survive in his studio band or even co-exist in the same place, that is the charisma of such a powerful portrayal, no praise is overstated. Finally, this film jumps to my current No. 1 of 2014, and good luck in the Oscars!",9,1,4,17 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Fifths is not a charm for Leo
","After dumping his longtime companion Robert De Niro for the hey-day Leonardo DiCaprio in the naughties, Martin Scorsese embarks on a series of ambitious enterprises to earn his overdue Oscar statuette, finally third time is a charm, THE DEPARTED (2006, 8/10) achieved that goal, but poor Leo is still Oscar-less, so their fifth teamwork is THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, an excessive satire of Jordan Belfort's autobiography, a former Wall Street stock-broker's rise and fall from 1980s to 1990s, which grants Leo the uppermost leniency to embody this corrupted, decadent and indecent character with inordinate excess and extravaganza, unfortunately, Leo's time has yet arrived. Running around 180-minutes, the film is ultra-snappy and the camera faithfully acts in accordance with the doped delirium where Jordan (DiCaprio) and his cohorts habitually reside, it is an out-and-out wealth-flaunting satire, periodically overreaches its boundary with benumbing and slightly off-putting repletion since Jordan's hollow life perpetually orbits around money, sex, drugs and drug-addled misdemeanors. Marty doesn't trouble himself to go deeper than that, the trenchant point is, Jordan is no more than an eloquent salesman and a shallow opportunist, luck is on his side at the right time, but he fails to apply a failsafe mechanism to get away with it, ironically, it is the American judicial system let him slide, all the more it incites audience to detest the hypocritical political body of democracy, which is inadequate in its wealth distribution and justice upholding. Leo's performance is voraciously full of vim and vigor, he devotes every effort to light up the screen with incredible body language and pitch-perfect accuracy with beguiling pomposity, but, an indelible impression is that with every gesture he poises, every line he delivers, simultaneously he is thinking of that damn Oscar, he even makes Jordan lovable and immensely watchable, it is his charisma, not his character's, which may bar him from winning in the race this year. Two-times Oscar nominee (alas!) slash red-hot comedy actor Jonah Hill, not a fan of his performance in MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), there is no big stretch for him to showcase his prowess as a serious thespian here, he is uproarious and cheeky as Donnie Azoff, Jordan's best buddy, like in his other more coarse comedies, the only difference is this is a Marty's film Having said that, a preciously meaty part is when Donnie is choking and Jordan tries to save him, but we can vicariously detect in one blink Jordan thinks it might be good to let him die. This is one of Marty's masterstrokes to reflect the complexity of human's intuitive caprice. New starlet Margot Robbie consummates her big screen breakthrough as Naomi Lapaglia, the second trophy wife of Jordan, she intermingles her utterly stunning sex appeal with aggressive fervor, which might bring to mind Sharon Stone in CASINO (1995, 7/10). Coincidentally, Leo's Oscar rival and eventual winner McConaughey (DALLAS BUYERS CLUB 2013, 7/10) has a ten- minutes screen time as Mark Hanna, the one who remarks on the golden criterion in the Wall Street business, McConaissance is irrepressible even for such a small role. It could be Leo's idea to curtail the role of Mark in the film in order not to lose the spotlight of his own. Also I must extol Spike Jonze's unexpected cameo which offers some imaginable salaciousness with his tacit smirk. Marty has already risen to a lofty echelon of a cinema maestro who can apply himself to manifold genres with top-notch dexterity, which his recent works HUGO (2011, 9/10), SHUTTER ISLAND (2010, 8/10) all potently bespeak. At the age of 72, the night is still young, may his outstanding creativity will never peter out, which is a tremendous blessing for all the children of cinemas.",8,3,5,12 June 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Glitz aside, it is a droll comedy
","It is dumbfounding that Coen Brothers' much-anticipated all-star period comedy had been slated to a dumpster February release earlier this year, which received a lukewarm attendance both from audience and critics. HAIL, CAESAR! ostentatiously settles into the less vaunted category of Coen Brothers' comprehensively well-appreciated oeuvre - a droll comedy sans palpable grittiness, threatening violence or gallows humor, more ebullient in its tenor and visual dimension, a closer cousin of A SERIOUS MAN (2009), O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (2000) and THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998), rather than their award-reaping vehicles such as BARTON FINK (1991), FARGO (1996) and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007),This time the milieu is in Hollywood's Golden Age, more specifically, 1951, a glittery insider-story of movie business told from the studio executive and producer Eddie Mannix (Brolin), a real-life character infamous for his 'fixer' obligation - to whitewash all kinds of unsavory private lives of Hollywood stars, in order to maintain their public image and not jeopardize the merchandize they are headlining. Yes, most of its star-cast gets their inspiration from real people, sometimes a combo of several, it is all for oldie-savants to trace and locate their references.The main hurdle for Eddie on that day is something could be made into a big fuss, but plays out in a much unruffled manner, the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock (a goofily personable Clooney in a suit of Roman armors, plays dumb and ingenuous at full tilt), currently engaged in shooting their heavily-budgeted production, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, is abducted from the set and therefore, Eddie has to gather the ransom and deliver it, which seems to be a cinch for him, as he casually packs the money into a briefcase and drifts through different sound stages, parries the harassment from the rivaling tabloid columnist twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker (a brash Swinton in her gaudy attire), multi-tasks and mediates various emergencies on the sets.Meanwhile, we have no trepidation about Baird's safety, he is kidnapped by a crop of Communist screenwriters, as a means to extort their shortchanged paycheck by churning out scripts for the big-boss studio, an in-joke cues the HUAC scandal in 1947 and with the involvement of a particular Mr. Marcuse, Coen brothers' sophisticated humor shtick is not at all instantly raucous, but stirs some indelible comic reverberations in after effect, especially when a USSR submarine solemnly emerges in the midnight just to pick up that one specific comrade, it is inwardly sidesplitting, although, the upshot of the ransom has plunged deadly into platitude, no way Coen Brothers would allow that money to fall into the hands of Communists.An omnipresent smirky levity hovers around the whole movie, the cast is well assigned to their particular sphere of personae, Channing Tatum is still handsome and nimble-footed a decade after his STEP UP (2006) days; Scarlett Johansson is a twice-married prima donna now gets knocked up with a director (Lambert) who will not acknowledge the affair, owns the most gorgeous set piece as a mermaid among a team of dual-colored synchronized swimmers. Josh Brolin stylishly enjoys a field-day of all the hustle and bustle, the only problem of his Eddie is that he confesses too often about his cigarette-snuffing. But, unexpectedly, the biggest asset of this comedy is Alden Ehrenreich, who doesn't even have his own picture on the poster, he plays Hobie Doyle, a young upstart in the showbiz who wins audience in Western pics for his cowboy antics, and is cast by the producers to star in his first non-Western high-class drama talkie, directed by the acclaimed European director Laurence Laurentz (Fiennes), the segment where he is harangued by Mr. Laurentz to rectify his drawling intonation and hillbilly accent is comedy of the highest calibre, Alden also does an extraordinary job with dexterous √©lan when he is required, he is definitely the cynosure against a more well-established thespians, a brilliant cast call as the young Han Solo, and HAIL, CAESAR! is his four-square stepping stone into stardom.Last but not the least, about the legendary DP Roger Deakins, who has blessed this film with an utterly glittery veneer of this line-of-work's sleekness and glamor, incredulously counterpoints what lies beneath, its wackiness, idealism, hypocrisy, partisanship and depravity, all reflected from self-mocking lens of the two from the in-crowd.",8,2,4,2 October 2016
The Mission," The Mission: 5/10
","Holding the prestigious fame of the Palme d'Or winner of 1986, THE MISSION to me is a structurally uneven piece whose only prerogatives are Morricone's intriguing score and DP Chris Menges' picturesque shots (deserve his Oscar winning).I don't know what the accuracy between the film and the historical event, the film failed to impress me neither in a religious aspect, nor in its moral level. I could not totally commit myself into the narrative, judging by De Niro's character Rodrigo, since killing his brother during an unexpected duel, until the redemption in the midway, the performance is paper-thin and maybe director Roland Joff√© didn't intend to dig into a deeper ground to elaborate on his character, which is a common measurement here, only Ray McAnally survives as the Cardinal Aktanurabo, not an arresting role, but the late McAnally owns every scene he presents. Another leader Jeremy Irons a (the iper-pious and righteous Father Gabriel), has also been hobbled by the mindless neglects, but he excels De Niro by a notch in the course of their restrained two- hander screen-time. Furthermore, I found it rather weird of the prolonged close-ups on Rodrigo's eyes before his ultimate demise (only after witnessing Father Gabriel being dispatched, he was able to close his intrepid eyes), maybe it is intentionally edited, but I could not figure it out the motivation. I should have rated this film a bit higher than a 5/10, but I must be loyal to my true feelings, the slaughter in the latter film is a pre-AVATOR holocaust (except one waterfall scene, reminds of Meryl Streep in THE RIVER WILD 1994), maybe the influence of a tragedy is a two-edged sword, in my case, all I receive is the negative energy, and renders a feeling of factitious propaganda for the Church and the Jesuits. So, bite me if you disagree.",5,2,5,25 July 2011
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," THE HOBBIT trilogy dutifully conducts its task as an overlong prequel
","Not intentionally, I missed the final episode of Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT trilogy in theatre, now a belated BluRay viewing can finally give a not so satisfactory closure to the Middle Earth adventure, 15 years, 6 epic-length features, although THE HOBBIT can hardly match the height of THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, still, it is hard to say goodbye to the mythical terrain where all the fantastic creatures reside, a toast to an end of an era.The prologue of THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is immediately continues where THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG (2013) finishes, in about 10-minutes, a ravaging Smaug (voiced by Cumberbatch) again fails to overcome his bad habit of verbosity, exits the scene thanks to Bard's (Evans) last arrow. Then, almost inclusively, the film embarks on a prolonged battle in the Lonely Mountain, involving dwarfs, elves, men, and two armies of orcs. The only conflict is Thorin's (Armitage) obsession with all the treasure in the mountain (you don't need a magic ring to be delusional, treasures can do the same trick), which intrigues him to obstinately block the entrance of the mountain, refuse the survivors from Laketown and an elf army lead by Thranduil (Pace) to share the astronomical fortune, while they remain still and wait for the succour from his cousin D√°in's (Connolly) dwarf army. All is set to be an internecine war, yet orcs are too imbecile to know when a snipe and a clam grapple, it is the fisherman who profits. Thus, their impetuous arrival instantly unite elves, men and dwarfs as allies, together, after Thorin finally gets his senses back, they engage a final bloodletting battle to defend their common enemy.The action sequences seldom best its predecessors, a rehash of the grandiose battle array, soon retreat to the main combats, after dispatching two dwarfs to evoke pathos, all eyes are on Legolas (Bloom) Vs. Bolg (Tui) and Thorin Vs. Azog the Defiler (Bennett), one pointer for dwarfs, if you're rather good-looking, the odds of being massacred by orcs are pretty high. Yet, for the main battle scene, surprisingly Jackson is quite frugal in letting us witness how the battle is won on a grand level, Beorn (Persbrandt) is only seen in one glimpsing scene when he turns into a gigantic bear and hurtles to the orc troop, so is the Great Eagles, really there is no budget for that? Who can buy that?The cast looks jaded, not just Gandalf (McKellen), Bloom's Legolas, as swift as a jumping monkey, completely loses his knockout vitality, Bard is never seen shooting another arrow after killing Smaug, quickly retreats to be a second fiddler while Alfrid (Gage) is given too many scenes as an unrepentant nuisance, Thranduill is habitually putting on airs whereas Tauriel (Lilly) is not agile enough to save her love. Also the main anchor of the film is not Bilbo (Freeman), the master of burglar, anymore, it is Armitage's Thorin, carries the brunt of the flimsy narrative, it is his inner demon to grapple with, his hard-earned redemption to fight for and his sacrifice to tip the scale, despite compared as an inferior analogue of Aragorn, Armitage gives Thorin a full-blooded rendition in his last combat to win his dignity and honour back. As the ending intentionally circles back to the beginning of THE LORD OF RING with nostalgic bliss, THE HOBBIT trilogy dutifully conducts its task as an overlong prequel, to evoke that the next chapter is far more competent, intriguing and intricate, that's what every qualified prequel should do, just like STAR WARS.",6,1,6,6 October 2015
The Lion King," The Lion King
","Who would believe this is my first time watch this classic Disney jewel in the crown and the location was ruefully in the plane. After last year's mega-successful re-entering into 3D multiplexes, clearly it becomes more urgent for me to cancel it from my unfinished masterpiece list (there are more horrifying ones on my list which I wish I could show it here). THE LION KING is a timeless artwork, it's technical index could not remain its cutting-edge 2D advances in 1994, the story nevertheless is in perfect pitch for audience from every degree of ages, the HAMLET-inspired plot could feasibly find more evocation with adult groups while the colorful appealing is irresistible for youngsters. It's an archetypal win-win Disney Animation. The narrative is tightly intriguing, the O.S.T. is top-notch although I can hardly admit Elton John's voice is agelessly stunning but the tune of CIRCLE OF LIFE nostalgically strikes a chord to me (which serves as my initial introduction to the western pop music region). Another great merit originates from Jeremy Irons' hypnotically appealing British accent, which has transferred so much vigor to his villainous character. Apart from the theatrical outline, the bona fide comedic parts are also generous, the highlight without question belongs to 'hakuna matata', which has been elevated as a motto of life. By far I could only give the film an 8 out 10, in the future maybe I can procure a second chance with at least a HD version (3D should be spared notwithstanding), THE LION KING is Disney's apex of its 2D journey, and its longevity will testify that animation is an inseparable part of the family tree of film history, and it will always stun us commercially, technically and artistically.",8,0,0,28 May 2012
Inception," Inception
","This is the first film I saw in cinema in Shanghai after a six-month intermission (feels great back home). INCEPTION is no doubt an excellent choice after having already gained over 400 millions Chinese dollars (roughly 60 millions $) from Chinese box office, which is a magnificent feat as I know usually Chinese domestic box office blockbusters never dare to challenge audience's intelligence.Christopher Nolan has made it, INCEPTION at least parallels with THE DARK KNIGHT if not surpasses it! I give both film 9 out of 10 but with a slight preference of INCEPTION, I could not give a 10/10 as I'm a sheer perfectionist.Clearly this film is worth more than watching once, the conceptual comprehension still traps me, one great contribution is that the film knows exactly how to keep audience within the scale of tolerance of the intrinsic complexity and magnifies its necessity of re-watching, which is a quality so rare and precious to attain now.The scientific explanation which now we can find online everywhere, which is truly stunning! The script is nearly seamless sealed with plausible and logical connections. The visual effects create an eye-dropping feast of this era without throwing itself into recently ubiquitous 3D tricks.The acting is both impressive (from Leonardo and Marion) and entertaining (from Ellen, Tom and Joseph), the former is Oscar-baiting while the latter literally under-developed, love the little kiss banter between Joseph and Ellen. Another discovery is Tom Hardy, a promising rising star in Hollywood now (Sam Washington may feel threatened). INCEPTION is a film with an admirable conception beforehand ground on man's incessant pursuit of dreams, it has invented an appealing game which is unprecedented and designed in a flawless way to keep audience stick to their seats plus a lingering aftertaste. If I have to pick some bones out of this egg, I have to say the perfectness of the game itself is pessimistic which makes present life more meaningless and tasteless.",9,1,7,18 October 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie
","For the sheer grandeur of its production design, Kenneth Branagh's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS reboot is something should be fully appreciated on the silver screen, shot in 65mm film (a rara avis today), the period setting which it punctiliously re-enacts is a fetching treatment for a sore eye (although it would soon give way to a single-location detective procedurals when the train is halted on a truss by an avalanche amid the white wilderness), but for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie, both in regard to its structural design and the central interpretation of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian gumshoe Hercule Poirot. For starters, the murder mystery is almost exactly the same as its antecedent, whether it is due to the hallowed reverence to its source material or screenwriter Michael Green's incapability to ginger up the whodunit scenario, clearly and dishearteningly, slavish safety is the keynote to adhere when it comes to remakes, why bother if there is no substantial upgrade in the making? A transposition to 21st century would be a nice idea for instance. Perhaps, just to gather a star-studded cast can justify its own existence, with Branagh's gonzo- moustachioed Poirot hogging the spotlight, who is even granted a tepid prologue comes about in the Wailing Wall to introduce his fastidious quirks, and Branagh infuses an edgier temperament into Poirot's no-grey-zone presence of mind, but the over-familiarity of Sherlock Holmes is a dangerous sign of losing the detective's own distinction (since the Nile-cruising sequel has already been green-lit), also his underdeveloped omniscience begins to tell when magically, he gets the hang of everyone's carefully concealed identities, bearing in mind it is a time before Google, everyone! Approximately 10 minutes is fairly doled out to each of the rest core members of the cast, where most of the sequences are commonplace shot-reverse-shots and red-herrings are dished up, save some innovative camera arrangements either looking from the ceiling or outside the train. But despite the embarrassment of starry richness, only Michelle Pfeiffer's widow Caroline Hubbard (channeling some more soft-headed levity against Lauren Bacall's stern predecessor), manages to steal some thunder in the reveal, plus lending her exquisite voice in the song 'NEVER FORGET' over the end credits.The biggest artistic license is needless to say, the gorgeous THE LAST SUPPER tableaux vivants when Poirot pompously solves the puzzle, we must hand it to Branagh for the flourish, only pitifully it is also at the expense of the film's own plausibility, because the whole act conspicuously reminds us, as if there were no other passengers on the supposedly fully-booked Orient Express other than those circumspectly postured suspects, or rather, alluding to a more dismayingly insidious note, that the class stratification has completely forbidden those in the less fancy coaches to even disembark the train whereas those privileged few are allowed to step out of harm's way in face of their final judgement, this really stings.",7,1,4,26 November 2017
Finding Dory," Pixar is a godsend to us who are blessed with innocence and simplicity
","13 years for a sequel of a family-friend animation picture is something boldly risky in this consumerism age, since 2003, DreamWorks's SHREK series has been long over its last gasp after its fourth breath SHREK FOREVER AFTER (2010), BlueSky's ICE AGE franchise has reached an abysmal nadir with its latest fifth offering ICE AGE: COLLISION COURSE (2016), but FINDING DORY, the belated follow-up of FINDING NEMO (2003), inscribed with Pixar's trademark, safeguards itself as another superlative family fare can win over audience without age restrictions (from toddlers to the elderly).Storytelling is as always, the trump card for Pixar studio, the core of FINDING DORY is to find one's home, even for Dory (DeGeneres), the regal blue tang only has a short-time memory (an idiosyncrasy meritoriously hasn't been over-employed here), but how can Dory remember her family? Here the narrative deploys a conventional fillip, - sudden flashbacks of Dory's past conveniently transmit into Dory's mind with key information - to the trio's intrepid ocean-cross adventure, of course, clownfish father-son duo Marlin (Brooks) and Nemo (Rolence) cannot let her go gangbusters by all herself.Soon after, the movie's setting undergoes a sea change from the dim deep ocean (it is noteworthy the animation team doesn't choose to cartoon the ocean scenery, which looks extremely realistic than one would expect, murky, claustrophobic and uncannily threatening) to a man-made Marine Life Institute, where Dory is separated from Marlin and Nemo, the siren call is from Sigourney Weaver herself, this quite unanticipated change drastically lights up audience's sense of visual assimilation and introduces a new friend to Dory, the seven-tentacled, quarantine-obsessed octopus Hank (O'Neill), whose staggering camouflage skill would buoyantly lead Dory to a freewheeling caper, terra firma style. Shortly, Dory meets her childhood friend, a myopic whale shark Destiny (Olson) and her neighbour, a beluga whale Bailey (Burrell), the latter's re-gained echolocation capacity would play a really important role in Dory's and the clownfish pair find each other again (and again), that's another plus point of a Pixar vehicle, you can always learn something new in addition to all the roller-coastering fun. (octopus has three hearts, do you know that?)Certainly, there is an overhanging dreadfulness that Dory's parents might have been dead, and indeed FINDING DORY is dauntless enough to bringing death up for a closer look before diverting into something more traditional but also massively touching - all the shells lead to home, it is an emotive moment, how incredible neither Dory nor her parents have lost hope for their ultimate reunion (the story is one fish-year after FINDING NEMO 2003, but in human year, it feels like 13 years). Family first, but friends are in close second, in the third act, Dory has to go out on a limb to do something no other blue tang has ever done and off the beaten track to where no other blue tang has ever been, she must stop a truck heading to Cleveland on the busy overpass and set free the captured Marlin and Nemo, with the help of all her friends, mostly Hank and a ditzy common loon Betty, the upshot is that they release the entire aquatic life in transportation into the ocean along the truck itself, emotionally elevated by WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD and spectacular slow-motion, finally, Sia's rendition of UNFORGETTABLE in the coda pertinently leaves audience a lingering savour of blitheness and satisfaction.FINDING DORY doesn't have a concept as groundbreaking or intricate as INSIDE OUT (2015), but it is all the same, immensely fulfilling, so is the preceding wordless short PIPER (2016), directed by Alan Barillaro, where a baby sandpiper overcomes his primal fear about water and finally wallows in the waves near the sea, a pithy story reflects weighty meaning. All in all, Pixar is a godsend to us who are blessed with innocence and simplicity, we can only covetously wish its inspiration and talent never run dry.",8,1,8,24 July 2016
Arrival," ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist
","Denis Villeneuve's Venice-premiered Golden Lion contender, based on Ted Chiang's acclaimed short story, is this year's annual hardcore Sci-Fi offering from Hollywood, a trend inaugurated with Alfonso Cuar√≥n's GRAVITY (2013), and followed by Christopher Nolan's INTERSTELLAR (2014), Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN (2015). ARRIVAL dauntlessly tackles a probable but critical scenario on the precondition that one believes there are life forms off-world, which most Sci-Fi works heedfully gloss over: What if the extraterrestrial creatures' communicative mechanism, their pattern of logic and intelligent competence, or in a more interactive sense - their 'language', is totally different from ours and radically beyond our ken, how can we communicate with them, even on a very basic level?This basically sets the context for Villeneuve's solemnly cerebral head-scratcher. Dr. Louise Banks (Adams), a linguist, becomes the chosen one, enlisted by the US military Colonel Weber (Whitaker), when mysterious spacecrafts arrive on earth without warning (12 different loci across the globe, including one in Shanghai, my hometown). The team also includes the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Renner) and Captain Marks (O'Brien), they are sent to investigate the reason of the arrival when our world is veering into a global war (where China usurps Russia as the driving force spoiling for patriotic warfare). They enter the spacecraft hovering above the US soil, which grants its access every 18 hours, confounded and staggered by the anti-gravity abnormality, the elite team reaches the meeting point where the first contact has been cautiously attempted and initiated between human beings and the highly intellectual aliens, coined as 'heptapod', whose appearance resembles a giant octopus with multiple tentacles, from which they can express their language in an ideogram form (a grand circle with hieroglyphical inspirations).Louise takes baby steps in the ongoing progress of interpreting heptapod's language and deciphering their intention, but finds it extremely fascinating, concurrently, segments of her teenage daughter Hannah (a palindrome name aptly selected to comply with the novel's determinism slant), who died prematurely in her adolescence due to some terminal disease, which audience has already seen from the film's beginning as an intimately heart-breaking flashback, repeatedly materialize in Louise's consciousness, yet, the intriguing part is, what we perceive as flashback is actually flash-forward, at that point of the time-line, Louise hasn't yet to be pregnant (although she has already met her future husband), it is through her contact with heptapods, she is enlightened and inexplicably acquires the ability to foresee her future, thus, will she still want to bring Hannah into this world after realizing that she will lose her forever soon after?A more urgent question is the purpose behind the heptapods' arrival, it is always delicate to elucidate a recondite scientific ideology clearly using this particular medium, how can we comb through their unique realm of thinking and behavior which has literally surpassed the scope of human understanding, to presume a plausible answer? So, it is not surprising that Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer opt for a more blas√© and straightforward solution (Louise's bestowed prescience) to nip the impending war in the bud and heartily concretize the integrity of human species on a more vast and mysterious galactic map.Amy Adams staunchly carries the whole movie under her shoulder, touches the right chord as a savvy and doughty wonder-struck scientist who experiences the most unthinkable encounters and remains true to her cause, exemplifies the superlative virtues of us earthlings, she is magnificent to behold and the warmth and courage generated from her character are so vehemently affecting. Jeremy Renner, contributes a low-key, almost too well-disposed and even nondescript presence in the back seat, devoid of any kind of malice or ill-feeling, a fitting analogue of George Clooney's chummy persona in GRAVITY, just to be supportive and helpful to our heroine.ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity (breathtaking set designs and awe-inspiring VFX teamwork to create heptapods, their written language and their Brobdingnagian flying vehicles), which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist: minimalist, ultra-streamlined, less-is- more and apocalyptic, there is no flashy action set pieces to numb our senses, instead, the story adheres to Louise's personal revelation from A to Z, and the ghostly pervasion of J√≥hann J√≥hannsson's score is as soul-stirring as the images we are blessed to watch. After all, perhaps, the upcoming sequel of Ridley Scott's Sci-Fi chef-d'oeurve BLADE RUNNER (1982) might not sound as awful and doomed as it seems to be, a distinctive style shift can really pique our interest with the tastemaker Villeneuve at the helm.",9,37,72,9 September 2016
The Blind Side," The Blind Side
","This is surely a feel-good film which tries its best to tell the story of a wealthy white couple adopt a black teenager who has talent in football, in a drama-free and encouraging way. Surely enjoy the whole process of watching this film, but if one has time to reflect his mind, what's under its superficial surface is that the film proposes an important question, how to balance the pity and conscience. As nowadays 'selfless' good deeds are covered with some opaque disguises which makes people question the original intention, and I do believe every single action and word all has its own intention, ever subconsciously to the person himself. So Lynn selflessly takes care of Michael, behind which hides her own intention like Sean (her husband) mentions in the film because it gives you satisfaction. Sometimes maybe the answer is that simple, which I admire a lot from this film. The film is based a true story and considered a mainstream film aiming to all different levels of audiences and it succeeded it box office as a sleeper hit last year (earned more than 200 millions dollars domestically alone) and even nominated for 2 Oscars including BEST PICTURE and won the BEST ACTRESS award for Sandra Bullock. (One year before, who could imagine Sandra won an Oscar?), it truly shows that Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz or even Demi Moore and Meg Ryan will have their chances in the future! I will talk a little bit more about Sandra's Oscar winning for her role in this film. It is very tricky because some say it is a brave decision and others say it is a shame even worse than Gwyneth's winning in 1999. Five nominees, Sandra, Meryl Streep (Julie & Julia), Helen Mirren (The Last Station), Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) and Carey Mulligan (An Education). I haven't watch 'The Last Station', but just several years after 'The Queen', Helen needs to be more patient to gain her second Oscar, so this nomination actually is more suitable to be considered as a warm-up for this year (who has 3 Oscar-baiting films at hand). Gabourey and Carey are both wonderful in their roles but as both are new-comers, their votes is definitely split which makes them difficult to win. So my original prediction was going to favor Meryl, who totally would deserve her third win. But generally speaking I didn't have too much confidence in Julie & Julia, firstly Meryl don't own much screen time (she is the co- leader with Amy Adams) and I think there is a thin-line of difference between acting and imitation. I did fear that the only surprising nominee could beat Meryl was Sandra, which actually happened. So, let's take a look at her performance here, Sandra is the sole focus of this film, I think the director even sacrifices the deeper depictions of Michael (who should have been the obvious main character of the story). Actually Sandra's role is a little bit plain but she manages to carry the whole film and creates an unexpected chemistry with her comedically deadpan acting which surprisingly saves the film's tame storyline, and makes the film much more watchable and enjoyable. Thus in all respects, chooses Sandra is a more reasonable choice as Oscar still a local film awards anyway and most Americans love Sandra Bullock.http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,14 August 2010
Parasite," it is right time to give Bong a shot in his already robust arm
","Two years in a roll, films from Far East have snatched the coveted Palme d'or, after Hirokazu Koreeda's SHOPLIFTERS (2018), here comes this year's champ, Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE, his 7th feature, also first Korean film to be crowned the top honor in Cannes, which denotes Bong's almost inconceivable triumph in conquering both cinema's box-office and artistic fronts, a feat even Steven Spielberg cannot achieve in his salad days, Bong can indeed have his cake and eat it as well!Both SHOPLIFTERS and PARASITE hinge around the underclass, but a more apposite reference of the latter should be Lee Chang-dong's BURNING (2018), a Cannes also-ran, both Lee and Bong vigorously tackle the ubiquitous classism, the pathological canker in our modern society, while Lee deliberately and stylishly veils his central story with elusiveness and makes great play of the ambivalent mystique exuded from the unattainable pursuance of truth, here, Bong cunningly employs gripping genre tropes to underpin his trenchant perspicacity on the treacherous waters of rich and poor's co-existence.In Seoul, the semi-basement dwelling Kim family - patriarch Ki-taek (Song), his wife Chung-sook (Jang), their two adolescent children, son Ki-woo (Choi) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), slyly insinuates their way into being employed by the high-flying Park family, respectively, as their driver, housekeeper, English tutor and art teacher. Sparks fly and laughter erupts intermittently in the beggar-belief process of how each member of Kim family tactfully excels in their designated jobs and consecutively sells on the unsuspecting....continue reading the review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks!",8,1,7,13 September 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," BIRDMAN cannot escape its all-too-obvious self-awareness in spite of its equally overt artisanal conceit
","Finally I can get around to watch several current Oscar contenders before this year's ceremony arriving in mere two weeks. BIRDMAN is the most intriguing one, it might give Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu the prestige which his fellow Mexican compatriot Alfonso Cuar√≥n has received one year earlier for GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), simply because the film is the another formidable labor-of-love with a paradigm-shifting cinematographic endeavor, not a coincidence, the two films share the same DP Emmanuel Lubezki, not even detractors can deny BIRDMAN's spurious one-long-take gimmick is a wonder to witness, sometimes viewers are so much so that being overpowered by the slithering camera movements in the masterly spatial structures and even overlook the proceedings on screen, so, a re-watch is highly recommended. Basically the movie is a self-referencing parody, the former Batman Keaton plays a washed- up actor Riggan Thomson, whose most popular role is also in a money-grubbing franchise called Birdman as the titular superhero, now 20 years has past since the last time he was in that bird uniform, he is going to Broadway and trying to revive his career by writing, directing and staring a play adapted of Raymond Carver's WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE, finally this is a career-defining opportunity for Keaton and he nails it remarkably. Naomi Watts is Lesley, one of the actress of the play, it is her Broadway debut, she is so insecure of her acting capability, and also shares a girl-on-girl kiss with another actress Laura (Riseborough), sounds familiar, a tribute to MULHOLLAND Dr. (2001, 9/10), right? Also there is Edward Norton plays Mike Shiner, a vainglorious actor who comes on board in the last minute but turns out to be quite a prick both on and off stage, so I√±√°rritu must be fully aware of Norton's reputation before offering him such a meaty part which would be a comeback call for the once prodigal son (his play-off with Keaton is terrific!). One cannot left out Emma Stone, who plays Sam, Riggan's rehab-retreated daughter, with her druggy make-up and ever-so-popping eyes, an ex-junkie is so full of life. Her flaring-up tirade against Riggan's last-straw investment on this play is her ticket to an Oscar nomination.Antonio Sanchez's syncopated drum beats amps up the narrative wonderfully, in particular when Riggan battles with his undying alter-ego, the Birdman, his own demon which urges him to fight, to still be relevant in the downfall, through his illusory telekinesis, the imagined flying, and a real Time Square streaking, until the surprising curtain call in the premiere of the play, Riggan succeeds, which in an ironical way leaves him a bird-man mask on the face, he is on the top page of the newspaper again, until the inexplicable ending, the film tries very hard to maintain its strength as a dark comedy (against its unique faux-one-take guideline), yet Sam's expression in the coda certainly is a perfect solution to render this tall- tale with a phantasmagoric explanation. The race between BOYHOOD (2014, 8/10) and BIRDMAN has reached its acme thanks to the divisive outcome from SAG, PGA, DGA (all favor BIRDMAN) and BAFTA (BOYHOOD captures the top honor), although neither of them are in my top 3, I will give an edge to BOYHOOD. BIRDMAN owns its undiminished flair with its distinguished style, but personally, like the theater critic in the film (who is marvelously played by Lindsay Duncan in her cameo appearance), none of the characters are sympathetic enough to deserve our care and attention, a has-been cannot cope with the fact that he is past his prime, and needs a miracle to feel alive; an arrogant actor who can only liberate himself on stage whereas off stage, he is a giant pain in the neck; a spoiled daughter wandering in her post- rehab anxiety, these are awful personae who should not have the privilege to win audience over, of course, maybe in the eyes of academy members, they are way too relevant, too visceral, too reverberating but for the general mass, BIRDMAN cannot escape its all-too- obvious self-awareness in spite of its equally overt artisanal conceit, and for I√±√°rritu, one can assume that he knows showbiz is a stinking vat, but he cannot fully resist its alluring temptation, instead, he gives its a leeway and fawn on for its highest recognition. My sole hope is that the majority of the academy members' eyes are limpid enough to discern that.",8,1,9,11 February 2015
The Big Short," a robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable
","It takes guts to make a film has an indignant through-line in its core: the capitalistic turpitude resides inveterately in human's speculative and grasping inclination, because there is no redeeming feeling of triumph or sympathy with which one can empathize in the ugly truth. In the hands of those privileged few (bankers, financiers, mortgage brokers, real state agents, etc.), millions of ordinary people suffer as the brunt of its disastrous repercussions (the global financial crisis in 2008), and what's more unnerving, the same skulduggery is wheeled out under a new name soon after, and it will only take time to reach a boiling point again, there is absolutely no cure to change the status quo, because that's nuts and bolts of capitalism, who dares to overturn capitalism?In the face of such exasperation and pessimism, which director Adam McKay has no scruples to force down viewer's throat (for some it may seem like a bolt out of the blue, but for majority of its audience, it is like flogging a dead horse: bankers are evil, roger that!), THE BIG SHORT pluckily alternates its three strands of individuals who successfully presage the crisis and leavens its mass appeal by using a mordant fourth-wall-breaking tack to elucidate its arcane gobbledygook and bean-spilling (sometimes with star cameos, for instance, Margo Robbie in her bathtub), interlaced with signposting snapshots and burnished by a cutting-edge montage job from Oscar-nominated editor Hank Corwin. In toto, it rounds outs as a disarmingly sleek infotainment.But, there is a catch, reckoning the nature of those real-life characters' actions, they are whip- smart profiteers, who jump on the window of opportunity and feather their nests in the wake of others' miseries, yet, McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph also try to hold some of them in the moral high ground - namely Steve Carell's Mark Baum, who is deviled by his conscience and brims with sense of justice, and Christian Bale's Michael Burry, an one-eyed geek who at least invests his Brobdingnagian gain into good use (says the film's epilogue) - which is a safe move but clashes with the cynical reality it depicts, whereas both Oliver Stone's WALL STREET (1987) and Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) are much more honestly unsparing in scrutinizing the too-big-to-fall pathology and its fetidness. So a skeptical mind would unavoidably question, whether the supposed compassion towards these characters belies McKay's unsavory agenda to veer the film's tenor from a stringent expos√© to an adulation of their (self-seeking) acts? That is a dangerous signal.The ensemble cast is blameless though, Christian Bale's Oscar-nominated turn is hyperbolically eccentric, but he is competent enough to not let him slide into caricature and brings out a nice patina of ambiguity, dispassion and even pathos (why should we feel sorry for him?). Ryan Gosling is unapologetically bumptious (fun to watch thought) as the chief narrator and Brad Pitt, again, takes a beneficent role without too much challenge (12 YEARS A SLAVE 2013, remember?), which leaves Steve Carrell, who, actually, materializes a toothsome performance in a border-line leading role, carries the momentum engagingly until an eleventh-hour capitulation, only undercut by the conservative slant of the writers': kitted with such ammo, instead of rubbing the salt into the still- fresh wounds of a dysfunctional society, why not leaving a chipper mood to suggest opportunist can still run away with it? That is a minor disgrace in an otherwise robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable.P.S. My inner dialogue: '- Hey, it is a biographical film, those who are still alive can sue us for calumny! - Yeah, than don't make a biopic, cinema is composed of lies, and reality sucks!.'",7,1,1,17 April 2017
Prometheus," Prometheus
","As one of two most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2012 by most fervent cinema-goers, me included (the other is THE DARK KNIGHT RISE, doubtlessly), I watched it in the cinema, a plain 2D version, but in a nutshell, it is not satisfactory at all.The film has wrought some doze-prompted moments, there are just too many routine procedures have to be dealt with (tediously) to tell a tale (with clich√©-ridden dialogues and stereotyped roles) before any flare or more precisely, casualty to take action. Then quite ironically, the ill-fated first casualties are the geographer and the biologist (no career-based prejudice, I may watch too much of THE BIG BANG THEORY), whose raisons d'√™tre are never being expounded on, just like most of the remaining crew.What I could not expected is the mono-designed location, because one might take it for granted that with such a budget, at least, the crew of Prometheus could bring its audience to experience more polychromatic locales, but no (anyway, I cannot be too picky as the original ALIEN 1979 is also largely constricted), which cause some aesthetic fatigue since the same palette has occupying the screen for almost 120 minutes.The meat-and-potatoes virtue of the film nevertheless lies in its astronomically staggering SFXs, though trapped in a pretty dark hue background, the outer spaceship's emergence and the laconic crash has its magic spell to conquer any Sci-Fi fanboys' cravings. (Tiny spoilers below) The suicide attack is too reckless to feel cogent under its life-and-death circumstances and Ridley Scott has no intention to exude any mercy towards the cast, leaving no side branches makes the film desperately yearn for a new page and commence another chapter.The cast, the never-do-wrong Fassbender captures the spotlight again in his unexpected role (I will not spill the beans here) and a Ridley-remolded heroine Noomi Rapace picks up her gauntlet to emulate Sigourney Weaver's idolized torch-blazer, which comes out to be a shade pessimistic, but the surrealistic and unsettling self-operated Cesarean section is plain too shocking to believe one's own eyes, let alone the consequent recovery, this gal is not a woman, even not a human!Has another leading-lady-goes-supporting role in a mainstream summer production, Charlize Theron's faculty has not been fully dug (she could create and pull off more strain and mayhem if had given her role a bit more dimension, damn you screenwriters!), and so is Guy Pearce, whose presence is so unnecessary, if not just to pay extra stipends to the make-up team. Ostensibly to seek for human race's genesis, the film eventually left too many unexplained questions for it's supposed sequel (the box office is slightly under-performed so far), so if there will be one, Mr. Ridley please assures that it is the script which should be the paramount task to labor over!",6,3,7,11 June 2012
Halloween," John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is a seminal low-budget slasher that spawns an ever-growing horror franchise
","'The usual trappings of the genre, like gratuitous nudity, misogynist whiff, teenager lust and angst, are all prescribed in right dosage, plus the moral yardstick, Laurie is the final girl mostly because she is not sexed up like her two ill-fated friends, yet amidst the ludicrousness of screaming, panicking and stabbing, it is rather bathetic she doesn't emerge eventually as the savior herself (she has to leave the sharp knife beside a seemingly unconscious Myers not once but twice, turns her back to him and weep instead), it is a man who comes to her rescue in the person of Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence), Myers' psychiatrist, ok, baby steps, a heroine's self-making would run through the entire franchise for our scream queen Ms. Curtis, sinking her teeth in her very first movie.'read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",7,0,0,29 April 2020
Wonder Woman," DC Comics' first critical darling
","Mired in the discouraging dearth of a blockbuster leading by a super-heroine, Hollywood finally dishes up WONDER WOMAN, one of DC Comics' venerable triumvirate, directed by Patty Jenkins, it is a much belated sophomoric feature after her promising debut MONSTER (2003), and a legitimate star-making vehicle for Gal Gadot, who brilliantly incarnates herself in this iconic character with thorough conviction and pizazz. As a superhero's origin story, inherently the film has no alternative to spare audience the mandatory ex-positional narrative arc of Diana's backstory, she is a deicidal creation conceived by Zeus and Hippolyta (Nielsen), the Queen of the Amazons, to stop Ares, the God of War, from wrecking havoc in planet earth. The advent of a WWI Allied spy Steve Trevor (Pine) disrupts the tranquility of Themyscira, a hidden and empyrean island where resides the kingdom of these all- female Amazonians. After having the first contact with advanced mass-killing weaponry, pitched battlefield and sacrifice, against the will of her mother, Diana resolves to plunge herself into the WWI front, and firmly believes that if she can assassinate the evil German General Erich Ludendorff (Huston), whom she redeems as the reincarnation of Ares, the war will end. Aided by Steve and his allies, Diana gallantly enters into the mankind turmoil, and her faith will be put into test when things fail to turn out as she expected, does mankind really deserve her? An honest-to- goodness script shoots blunt barbs towards our patriarchal society and innate frailties, which emphatically differentiates the film from most its peers with its sobriety of what causes all the mayhem. The turning point also hits the mark when a heroic act viscerally teaches her what love means and why us, the lesser mortals still deserve her protection. What makes the movie click with mass audience is the humble and self-deprecating attitude in its backbone.On the other side of the coin, WONDER WOMAN is nevertheless, hampered by its comic strip puerility, from a black-or-white characterization to slipshod plot designation, villains are ill-fatedly sidelined to leave more room for catalyzing the improbable cross-species romance, and its comic relief is essentially PG-13 and in shortfall before everything will be duly embroiled with gravitas, pathos and moral conundrum. Be that as it may, Gal Gadot is indisputably an entrancing Wonder Woman, particularly in the action scenes, where she jumps, dashes, whomps, high-kicks like a genuine warrior choreographed with female-empowering confidence, wet behind her ears sometimes, but ultimately virtuous, courageous, lethal and unyielding. Accordingly, Chris Pine, although pigeonholed in a lesser salient role, breathes an air of endearment into the scene, Pine's personal charisma is a force to be reckoned with in spite of the limit of his potency, which is essential to precipitate the game- changing shift during the crescendo. From a strategic point, the movie's success bracingly reassures the stuffy studio bosses that audience is heartily welcoming female talents both before and behind the camera, and also substantiates that DC Comics can finally take up the gauntlet from Marvel Universe after many an underperformed juggernaut and at the very least it sparks a possibility that it may interrupt the latter's hyper-prolific monopoly in the market, which is always a good thing for audience looking for diversity and pluralism.",7,4,11,11 June 2017
Despicable Me," Despicable Me
","This is the first 2010 animated film I have seen, it was a funny journey for me, first of all, Steve Carrell's funny voice is a main attribution as the protagonist Gru, and his yellow minions are unbelievably cute and adorable, plus three little cherubic girls, it is difficult not to love them. Now Pixar has set up an unsurpassable criterion in front of all animated films, which is a regulatory competition to urge other film studios to elevate the quality of their animated films; another advantage is to broaden the demography and attract more adult spectators to walk into the cinema for an animated work. To cater for the anti-hero trend, the film focuses on a relentless thief aiming to steal the moon to achieve the honor of world's No. 1 thief of the world. With an unexpected intrusion of three organ girls, his scheme is off the track, but don't worry, there will be a happy ending. The design of the character is well-crafted, Since the opening scene of the stolen Egyptian pyramid, the comic atmosphere has hung over all over the film. On the other hand, the villain Victor fail to steal the thunder.I am still eager to watch TOY STORY 3, THE ILLUSIONIST, and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, I wish I could always keep an innocent heart to accept excellent animations.",7,0,1,2 January 2011
Carrie," Carrie
","Now this Stephen King's horror classic has been confirmed for a remake which stars Chlo√´ Grace Moretz and my diva Julianne Moore (highly likely to take on the role of the religion- maniac mother), both reinterpret two Oscar-nominated performances from Spacek and Laurie, with the juicy fodder, a belated Oscar finally seems to be approaching for my goddess (finger crossed). So it seems to be a properly perfect time for me to watch the original version for the very first time. Brian De Palma, has been considered Hitchcock at his time by his devotees, the similarity is both haven't received much awards-crammed recognition, but arguably De Palma is a lesser player as his oeuvre encompasses more run-of-the-mills, but CARRIE is by any standards not among them, and it could be his PSYCHO (1960) because De Palma shows off his artistry in a full-fledged sweep. For instance, there are many eye-dropping stunts: the opening credit, slow-motion of volleyball girl's changing room until Carrie's first bloody period running through her fingers; the multi-prisms perspective images after the blood splattering all over Carrie after a long-stewed happiness-hanging-by-a-thread preparation; the havoc of massacre at the prom is more supernaturally gratifying than scary. The mother-daughter face-off and subsequent house caving into debris scenes may be attributed to produce a more crowd-please impression (despite of its low-budget SFX and the well-expected surprise at the coda), the film could hardly be pigeonholed as a horrorfest, as Carrie is ubiquitous in every school, every class, a bully-defying story has much more drama empathy even after 35 years after its debut, which could nicely explain the ground for a remake now. Sissy Spacek is against the grain to portray a teenage girl due to her actual 27 years old age, the immense age difference is rarely perceivable if one doesn't know it before and Ms. Spacek is on fire in it, renders an extraordinary transformation from vulnerability to malice. Piper Laurie as well doesn't betray her Oscar nomination to give birth to a conflicting mother role which is hauntingly unforgettable. All in all, thanks to Stephen King's story to surmount many genre clich√©s and continue to stagger us with the rosy remake in 2013.",8,4,4,29 May 2012
Taken 2," Taken 2
","Feeling listless in a lackluster season for cinema-goers, I simply yearn for the smell of the multiplex and it had been almost one month since my last visit, so TAKEN 2 has been singled out in view of that I had a mildly positive viewing from its first one (TAKEN 2008, 7/10), and action-packed thriller will at least not be a bore (a sad truth is that here is so difficult to find non-dubbed animation features, otherwise the selection would be much wider).Being an emblematic sequel relying on the same gambit and stunts to pass through its running time, TAKEN 2 can hardly be called satisfactory, thanks to the rapid editing and effective camera rotation (another tact being overdone here), the gawky Liam Neeson still can render a patina of a sleek special agent, all his moves are pertinent and deadly fatal, nevertheless, reaching 60-year-old, perhaps his next invitation (apart from TAKEN 3, according to its groundbreaking first weekend bravura, a sequel is undoubtedly on the slate now) will be sent from Stallion's THE EXPENDABLES tawdries, and one thing is for sure, he will not be the oldest. Maggie Grace and Famke Jansen both have earned more screen-time, but hardly have any decent time to be composed enough to deliver some jolly one-liners. The plain storyline has efficaciously implemented the genre fun in the most predictable manner (also an over-simplified one), for example, the special knacks (throwing the grenades among the shacks, counting the seconds to remember the route of the vehicle while being blindfolded) required to locate the whereabouts are too far-fetched since Istanbul is not a remote village and most of the time, the whole scheme is made deliberately to facilitate the film to justify itself, screenwriters (Besson is implicated) simply don't care much to the details and the suspense has never been concocted absorbingly, no matter how many Albanian villains are mercilessly iced by our hero, himself, his ex-wife and daughter's safety has never been severely endangered, so supposedly all the pleasure should be derived from the unnecessary killing of the ferocious but mostly marginalized Albanian avengers, what's the point then?Director Olivier Megaton is an action genre journeyman (COLOMBIANA, 2011; TRANSPORTER 3, 2008, 4/10), but this time it's Luc Besson who has short-changed his followers afresh, and forebodingly this is not the last time.",5,0,3,9 October 2012
X-Men: First Class," X-Men: First Class
","As most summer blockbusters have lost its credibility and novelty in recent years, this 120 minutes prequel gratifies me with its intricacy of different characters and the visual thumps (Magneto Vs. submarine scene is expressly phenomenal notwithstanding that it had been seen in the trailer). The overwhelming bromance between Professor X and Magneto has meshed well with the gay trend and indeed the film can be introduced as a mutants version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN without too much toil (taking account of the overtone of the similar social situation between gay and mutant), plus nearly all female characters are curbed as wallflowers (Rose Byrne, Jennifer Lawrence) or stereotyped femmes fatales (January Jones, Zoe Kravitz). It's a man's world, even for mutants. A major merit is that the film magnificently applies the Cuban missile crisis into and plot and subsequently maneuvers a credible Cold War milieu, which according to the director Matthew Vaughn, he got the inspiration from earlier James Bond films. About the cast, James McAvoy plays a brainy-over-brawny hoot with ease while Michael Fassbender exudes a menacing characteristic which could widen his remit into an unprecedented area (2011 dooms to be his year, JANE EYRE, A DANGEROUS METHOD and SHAME, I bet at an Oscar nomination is unquestionably within his reach). The mutual attraction between them is mesmerizingly fruitful. But the villain Kevin Bacon is pigeonholed as a shallow badass which falls into the so-called Hollywood miscreant's formula, although his language versatility is the only saving grace. Still the film cannot or dare not to be a true alien from its kins or to be distinguished from other Marvel pics, hackneyed tactics are ubiquitous (compared with Vaughn's groundbreaking previous work KICK-ASS 2010), and some parts are tedious enough to bring about a tad repellence (notably the invincible Kevin Bacon Vs. human soldiers, and the assault on the mutant base, the slaughtering is purely annoying and corny). Now it is not clearly whether the film will reignite a further sequel since its the box office transcript is well underperformed. It's a pity that it is much more entertaining than THOR and the newest installment of the Caribbean pirates.",7,1,2,7 September 2011
The Wolverine," The plot is untenable in retrospect
","Generally speaking, X-MEN series is my favorite among the superhero universe, yet the distant memory of Gavin Hood's X-MEN ORIGINS:WOLVERINE (2009, 7/10) has faded into blurry fragments, this time, Hugh Jackson's Logan (who is in top form in his Wolverine physique) embarks on an exotic journey in Japan, all by himself (with Jean haunting him all along to allure him into discard his immortality), to say a farewell to an old friend Yashida (Yahmamouchi) in his dying bed, whom in the opening sequences, Logan saves during the Nagasaki bombing, only to discover there is a sinister scheme awaits. First of all, apart from the opening 20 minutes, the story exclusively takes place in the present Japan, which instantly sheds the fatigues of the usual westernized landscape and gives the film a perky start with all the intrigues of an impending internecine strife inside an affluential clan, then, gradually removes Wolverine off his instantaneously resuscitative superpower, makes him vulnerable while hatching a romance with Mariko (Okamoto), the granddaughter of Yashida and the forthcoming heiress of his entire enterprise, and saving her from the assault of yakuza sent by her power-seeking father Shingen (Sanada) and the voluptuous fianc√© Noburo (Tee), which turns out to be a lame red-herring, frustratedly betrays the well-expected final twist, a subterfuge never altogether feasible in retrospect. The action sequences are slick at its most, aka. the fight on top of a fleeting bullet train, and at its lowest is the showdown near the end, the villainess Viper (Khodchtenkova) doesn't live up to our expectation as an anomaly in this male-dominant profession of a brainy ringleader, neither does her combat skill. Otherwise, the routine stunts (samurai, yakuza and an over-sized robot in a shining armor etc.) can barely raise viewers's eyebrows.The movie ostensibly offers a moderately engrossing experience for a first-viewing, nothing extraordinary, but also on a par with its blockbuster standard. Nevertheless, during the post mortem, the story itself contains a glaring plot-hole which cannot go without noticing. I hope I am not nitpicking, and spoilers alert, if all Yashida wants is to take over Wolverine's power of immortality, what's fuss to make all the t√™te-a-t√™te talk, cause family frictions, poison Logan with the risk of him being killed (I suppose a dead Wolverine is no good use for him), and fake his own death with his funeral being broadcast nationally, thus even he would acquire the immortality, how would he justify his outr√© rise from his grave? He could simply send Yukio (Fukushima) to convince Logan to fly to Japan, and clandestinely capture him using Viper's poison and take his power by force as they actually do in the climax, no more casualties needed in any rate. I blame this on the screenwriters' sloth to not even try to fabricate more sense for such a gigantic production. Or maybe this is purposefully conceived as a perspicacious mockery to the double-crossing psyche acutely concealed beneath the humble surface of the quintessential Japanese good manners? I hope it is merely my needless reckoning, otherwise James Mangold did have some guts to imprint his political spin into such a widely accessible Hollywood merchandise! Well, I doubt this is the case anyway.",5,1,3,9 April 2015
Win Win," Win Win
","This inspiring indie film is director Thomas McCarthy's third feature, whose first two films THE STATION AGENT (2003) and THE VISITOR (2007) have been touchstones for newbie Hollywood indie filmmakers and this time, WIN WIN underpins this theory and is on its way to gain Mr. McCarthy a broader audience and a more auspicious future as a director instead of an actor, I still recall Thomas' ill-fated role in 2012 (2009). The film is everything one can expect from a sincere dramedy, a solid cast, an entangled plot which merely touches the verge of skepticism (anyone is willing to challenge why our protagonist is still able to earn his monthly commission while put the old man in a sanatorium? who the hack pay for the posh nursing home?), all the dramatic emotion surge is being perfectly balanced and manipulated along with the witty quips and farcical slap-sticks. Continuing director's trademark of surrogate family, in WIN WIN, the story looks like an upgraded version of THE BLIND SIDE (2009) and the situation becomes more tangled when the kindhearted premise is based on a selfish profit, then the quick-fire struggles are much more convincing. The wrestle game is another high-light in the film, quirky but really funny (I do prefer wrestle to football).Paul Giamatti is never being better and Amy Ryan is wholeheartedly lovable to be cast against her stereotyped tough roles, Bobby Cannavale and the novice Alex Shaffer are amazing as well, plus a typically underrated Melanie Lynskey whose capacity is no less than her co-star in HEAVENLY CREATURES, Kate Winslet. her enactment of a heartless and mercenary mother is able to hold water. The warmth is pervasive in the film even when it plunges into its darkest hour, WIN WIN is an exquisitely small film harbors a grand ambition to give everyone a feel-good experience to encourage oneself to being a better person, which is a genuine win-win for both filmmakers and its audience.",8,0,1,9 September 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","Watched it in front of an IMAX screen in the cinema, and as the curtain call of Nolan's Batman trilogy, the film has maintained the superiority of its precedents THE DARK KNIGHT (2008, an 8/10) and BATMAN BEGINS (2005, an 8/10). While it is not my most anticipated film of the year, but undeniably other superhero cash-burners let's say THE AVENGERS (2012, a 5/10) could shamefully pale in comparison. The CGI-generated SFXs are remaining as the trilogy's strong suit, the plane-on-plane hijacking and the subsidence of the football field (both are hyped in the trailers) are the apotheoses, but on account of the fact that perceptibly the visual pinnacle has been unsurpassably accomplished in INCEPTION (2010, a 9/10), I cannot help but feeling a little surprised that the film hasn't flooded us with more, but on the other hand, it is also a wise decision since it could have also prompted an opposite side affect, which THE AVENGERS has achieved, too much meaningless bombarding would also make one feel nonchalant and numb about what is really going on. So admittedly TDKR does a decent balance not to let the SFXs kill off the potency of the narrative.To conclude the final chapter, Nolan puts Batman through the wringer of more physical destruction (by the enormously bulky Bane), but no one would fret over it, as soon or later he would rise like a phoenix from the ashes (which is banal but the only option left), meanwhile during his recovery an anarchic society has been founded, and being a Chinese, it does evoke a sensitive resonance of China's culture revolution in 1970s (which I have fortunately not experienced), the public verdicts of the rich and the powerful are under the name of the collective decision of all the people. Which is rarely seen in a mainstream Superhero flicks, and it earns Nolan the 'NO GUTS NO GLORY' medal. But the plot itself also undermines the film a bit, the major hindrance is the villain's motivation, they kick off a suicidal nuclear bomb and decide to die with it, not to mention the arbitrary twist which gives Bane the gigantic bathos. The stellar cast is solid but there is no standout like Heath Ledger in TDK, if I have to name my favorites, it has to be Anne Hathaway, an ambiguous Catwoman with more undertone beneath, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, it seems that he has come to the time when he could reboot the serials on his own shoulder. The long and the short of it, TDKR is an enjoyable, ambitious film which can eclipse most films of its peer, but sadly it is not the crowning glory among Nolan's chef d'oeuvre, and his crowning time has yet to come.",8,5,11,12 August 2012
Black Panther," BLACK PANTHER is not an anomaly among Marvel's puplist offerings
","To view the with-it and all-the-rage BLACK PANTHER's record-breaking phenomenon through an outside-the-stateside perspective, there is a sadness in our desensitized force-feeding by those ballooning superhero tentpoles whose by-the-numbers narrative, churned out in a rigidly formulaic mode, gingerly cleaves to its comic strip origin, a populist black-or-white world-view and nothing is in the gray area, heck, relative to which, BLACK PANTHER is not an anomaly. In a fictive African nation Wakanda, which poses as a third-world country but is endowed with cutting-edge technology by virtue of its natural reserves of an omnipotent metal named 'vibranium' (the metaphor is self-evident), T'Challa (Boseman) takes over the throne after the death of his father King T'Chaka (John and Atandwa Kani in different time frames), which occurred in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016), and soon finds himself facing the challenge from Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Jordan), the son of his uncle N'Jobu (Brown), who is spoiling for avenging his father's death in the hand of T'Chaka and indeed he successfully dethrones T'Challa in the duel. But, crippled by the time-worn slight of many a villain before him, he pulls his punch in the coup-de-gr√¢ce which doesn't immediately dispatch T'Challa (it pains this reviewer to watch that falling off a cliff never actually kills the protagonist) as audience placidly anticipates the latter to rise like a phoenix from the ashes to recoup his final victory by executing a fratricide just like his father.However by-the-book the story unfolds and segues, director Ryan Coogler vamps up the film with a scintillating visual-scape which foregrounds the spectacular world-building of Wakanda, drawing on the African land's exotic scenery and its tribes' indigenous looks and accoutrements, beautifully marries the tradition with the streamlined futurity, an action piece set in South Korea induces the right dosage of spills and thrills (a step up of virtual reality and driver-less car), and effectually whisks away Martin Freeman's agent Everett Ross to a place where he can viscerally experience the sticking-out-like-a-sore-thumb otherness, not without self-abasing humor to hit home its message.  Essentially what benefits BLACK PANTHER greatly is the fact that it is woke enough to centralize a cohort of black superheroes and especially cautious to not let its female characters eclipsed below the masculine shadows. Both Danai Gurira's ballsy virago Okoye and Letitia Wright's gizmo-savvy princess Shuri are inspirational characters and can-do warriors, which dwarfs Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia into awkwardly comporting herself within a more conventional love interest cubbyhole. With that in mind, then it appears there is a crying shame to leave a geared-up Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) out of the battle completely, an imposing Bassett shouldn't be all toned up just to fit the garment, maybe ageism is next-in-line as the genre's bullet-point obstacle, considering elderly folks in the comic books rarely live to a privileged death of natural cause (including a venerated Forest Whitaker here to extract empathy). Chadwick Boseman makes for a very fine hero, majestic in stance and feline in motion, Michael B. Jordan, on the other hand, has a more naturally hunky stature and finishes off the antagonistic job with spanking commitment. Only, this reviewer has to quibble about their final smackdown, and floats a comparison with the climatic fistfight adjacent to a zippily streaking train in Wong Kar-Wai's THE GRANDMASTER (2013), for all its kinetic momentum, is the former a homage to the latter, or a less enlivening show piece that doesn't necessarily live up to all the awesomeness preceding it? Either case, 'don't believe the hype' is always the ultimate maxim any film lover should religiously abide by.",7,1,2,29 March 2018
Mother!," A cause c√©l√®bre sprung out of this year's Lido island
","A cause c√©l√®bre in this year's Lido island, Aronofsky's MOTHER! has crushed and burned in its homeland's box office front and precipitated polarized reactions from both critics and audience, which is a usual given to galvanize a cinephile's interest. MOTHER! has a disguised threadbare set of components but its construct is vastly ambitious, even errs on the side it. It is set in a single location (an antiquated villa), in an indefinite space (the wilderness) and time (there is a telephone but no signs of cell-phones), score-free, no name is designated to its dramatis personae, (after checking online after), a married couple, Him (Bardem) and mother (Lawrence), is living in his family residence, Him is an acclaimed poet stuck in the writer's block and mother, decades younger than him, starts to re-decorate the house all by herself. Their placid domestic facade is disrupted by two interlopers, credited as simply man and woman (Harris and Pfeiffer), him, a gravely ill man with a wound in his rib (in a transient scene one can barely discern the locus of the wound), the signs are all over the place (only it is practically an incomprehensible task for an audience entering the movie with a tabula rasa): the biblical metaphor, which continues when later in the story, the man and woman are evicted by mother for breaking Him's precious crystal, following by their elder son kills his younger brother in an impulsive rage, now you can feasibly connect them with their unsaid names. Up to this point, Aronofsky has fervidly contrived a hybrid between a home intruder thriller and a haunted house horror (literally a beating heart within the walls has been presented more than once), and Jennifer Lawrence's heroine is the undivided cynosure of the story, often in jittery close-ups enclosed by a claustrophobic and dreadful palette. Heralded by the film's foreboding title card, motherhood is in the offing and Him regains his inspiration but all hell will break loose in the night when their baby is born, topping off with a disorienting, anarchic maelstrom with inarticulate transgressions. It is an ire-fanning third-act jam-packed with cult craze, frenetic editing and smothering pandemonium, until mother incinerates their domicile as the last resort and resets the Garden of Eden to the ground zero, an iteration of the film's gnomic prologue, displaced with a new mother. The parable is intentionally to be construed as how mother earth has been slowly encroached and finally destroyed by humanity's wantonness, but in hindsight, it is more revealing as a cautionary manifesto about a trophy wife, living under the throes of her husband's authority, habitually being neglected by him and treated like air by others, and her functionality is boiled down to either as a catalyst for his creativity or procreation, nothing more, and in the end of the day, she can be anonymously superseded by another young flesh, is this a feminist agitprop in disguise? Headlining by a solid star-turn from Jennifer Lawrence going down through an excruciatingly disturbing path of self-demolition and a dastardly Javier Bardem emitting increments of creepiness and noxiousness, plus an eye-catching menacing presence from a barnstorming Ms. Pfeiffer, this masochistic allegory is shunted to a less savory orbit by Aronofsky's abandon in his well- intentional ideology and a no-holds-barred modality (is that you Kristen Wiig?), when you make God acts like Satan, the ennobled epithet 'auteur' is incontrovertibly degraded as 'provocateur', thus, no universal acclaim can be garnered from that stigmatized word.",7,1,2,23 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not deserve all the raging criticise, but also, not a stunner
","Critics are bringing Zack Snyder's follow-up of MAN OF STEEL (2013) under fire, whose subtitle DAWN OF JUSTICE blatantly heralds the ambitious blueprint for the Justice League in DC extended universe, a pressing imitation of Marvel's success. The superhero blockbusters are all the rage now but, a detrimental feeling of enervation is also palpable after the recent barrage of over-frequent output.MAN OF STEEL fails to duplicate the victory of IRON MAN (2008) as the vanguard of DCEU, although Snyder's sombre colour aesthetics has its vein in all his works, it definitely differentiates itself from Marvel's wheelhouse and attracts a great amount of loyalties, that's why its box-office doesn't bomb despite of the lopsided broadsides from critics. Another viable disappointment may arise from a boomerang from the fervid anticipation of a Batman vehicle, which turns out to be not at all on the same level of Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy. Still, under the presupposition of Batman (Affleck) faces off Superman (Cavill), it is incumbent on Batman to be a less integral character (some personal reasons are introduced as an immediate after-effect from MAN OF STEEL) to find fault with Superman, because the latter has no dark side and can do no wrong, but Batman is of human breed, so presumably we are inclined to take the side of Superman, which could be a perfect opportunity to establish a more ambivalent angle for Batman, unfortunately, Snyder and his writers are too conservative on that front and the foe-to-friend changeover strikes rather underwhelming, only if Superman could yell the magic word before, we would have zero chance to see a God being bashed by a human with a little help of kryptonite. Plus, Ben Affleck is plain bog-standard wherever he acts in front of the camera under his emotionless thousand-yard stare.From xenophobia to the primary fear of God, Superman is facing a bigger challenge in the second chapter, and he is powerless to handle the equilibrium between his almighty puissance and his default setting in the human society, like a hero in an ancient Greek tragedy, self-sacrifice is his only exit of a cynical and inequitable world. Coupled with a fearless Lois Lane (Adams), their love becomes the saving grace among all the vices and maelstroms. Gal Gadot debuts as Wonder Woman is a satisfactory stunner, with a feature film slated next year, finally a female superhero can lead a blockbuster, good luck to that! Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is quirky enough but as a pallid phenomenon of uninspired villains in the comic universe, him and Doomsday founder on keeping our adrenalin driving.In whatever way, BVS is not a second-rate merchandise worthy of all the badmouthing, plushly constructed, wonderfully scored and self-seriously acted, it can best most of those Marvel stocks. But personally, it also takes down a peg or two compared with MAN OF STEEL, maybe it is a warning sign of the same concept has been cranked out ad nauseam, let's be prepared to see whether CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016) can alter the status quo by pitching superheroes against each other, instead of knocking off some inadequate super-villain clinkers.",7,2,3,28 March 2016
Blade Runner," Blade Runner
","I have finished this epochal cult film's final cut version (not much as a rematch since it vaguely left me any impression from the very first encounter, which took place more than 10 years ago), the film hasn't dated at all for 30 years, is still sharply crafty with an astonishingly visual impetus, which is pristinely avant-garde as well as its subversive kernel about the clone ethnics.BLADE RUNNER is an atypical Sci-Fi breed (loosely based on science fiction mogul Philip K. Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'), especially among its time overlapping with STAR WARS trilogy's heyday, it turns a completely opposite aesthetic approach (the nearly all moist and dingy settings, an anti-hero and anti-villain characterization, a foredoomed fatalism spin, the grotesque costume and character moulding, parsimonious fighting sequences), which bears itself out as one of the paramount film in its genre. The film might be trapped in its lengthy narrative tempo, but every single scene is devised with a cataclysmic desperation, resembles Ridley Scott's renowned career-breaking masterpiece ALIEN (1979). While Harrison Ford plays against his comfort zone as a battered 'human' blade runner, its's Rutger Hauer's replicant Roy Batty overshadows everyone else, buoyed up the somber aura using his near hysterical interpretation of a perplexed highly-intellectual creature whose resentment and despair are so palatable and evocative. The birth of the film was a notorious plight at that time, with an alienated team and financial lapse, even after its theatrical release, its flaccid box office performance sentenced the demise of its outlook, that said, it is a film ahead of its audience by many years, and now its classic rank has been established, how comforting and gratifying.ps. this year Scott's much-hyped prequel of ALIEN sega, PROMETHEUS has unveiled its second trailer, which seems that Scott is back on his virtuoso trajectory, another bona fide classic is forthcoming? This summer it is a battle between PROMETHEUS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, keeping fingers crossed it will be a win-win denouement.",9,1,4,21 March 2012
The Greatest Showman," Is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence
","To accord validation to a biopic of the American showman P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), the creator of he Barnum & Bailey Circus (which was closed in May 2017 after 146 years), one cannot bypass its subject's money-seeking avarice and unethical modus operandi, above all, the exploitation of his dysmorphia-scourged menagerie from which he made fame and fortune in the first place, by that yardstick, Australian Visual Effect craftsman Michael Gracey's directorial feature debut is a deep-fried shirker, whitewashing contentions and generalizing conflicts in servile service of a dazzling holiday fare, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, its star Hugh Jackman's passion project for years, is still a spectacular crowdpleaser even crippled by its craven artistic slant. Gliding smoothly through its slavish rags-to-riches template, the film wallows in its old-fashioned flair and punctuated by eleven anachronistic music numbers fashioned by the songwriting team behind LA LA LAND (2016), as a result they are robustly modern, infectiously hooky and choreographed with a modish MV-style sleekness. Jackman is a real trouper as Barnum and simply amazing to behold and listen to with his virtuoso showmanship (alas, this couldn't be his career-crowning achievement), Michelle Williams is magnanimously given a solo piece to belt out as the benign, perspicacious but neglected wife Charity, yet for my money, the goosebumps-inducing earworms are Efron and Zendaya's trapeze-enhanced REWRITE THE STARS, the impact is more visual than aural though, and the belter NEVER ENOUGH (a pop standard instead of the usual opera piece treatment), from the Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind (Ferguson), voice provided by Loren Allred. Ferguson, again certifies herself as the most stunning star today who is still endowed with the rarefied classical glamor and poise, we almost immediately forgive Barnum's infatuation with her just because she is that irresistible, who wouldn't capitulate under her spell, which conversely, makes Barnum's resolution to go back to his family nigh on apropos of nothing. That said, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence, last but not the least, as a picture whose protagonist is patently heralded as a man who promulgates diversity and pluralism, the glaring remiss is that none of the members of Barnum's freak show is vouchsafed even a subplot of their own (the sensational Keala Settle as the bearded lady for instance, deserves her own tale of woe before triumphantly lead the center piece THIS IS ME), a lip service well paid thanks very much!",7,4,8,31 December 2017
Monsters University," an underachiever for Pixar brand
","I haven't revisited MONSTERS, INC. (2001, 8/10) since its original release, so a decade later, forgive me for no photographic memory to scan the connections between it and its prequel (all I remember is Mike and Sullivan duo). But start afresh, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is no less entertaining than any other Pixar-labeled 'high-art' animations, although it doesn't reach the peak where the one-two-three punch WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10) has thrived. It is a standard college comedy, reminiscent of Harry Potter trio's adventure in Hogwarts, Mike being a male version of Hermoine the know-it-all, studious but more aggressive and pertinacious; Sullivan is the golden boy who struts and banters for popularity with his inborn stature and family prestige. So from foes to friends they have to learn their lessons in a hard way, Mike being an overachieving geek in the wrong game and Sullivan squandering his time and talent and taking a lofty goal for granted, twist number one; next step, an underdog's team work to crown the champion in the scary competition, but an indiscreet but understandable machine-rigging undermines the victory, this is twist number two; then an extravaganza into the toxic human world comes to a climax shows the pair's true potentiality and produces the twist number three; then unlike the conventional happy ending in Disney world, the twist number four heartwarmingly brings them into a niche place and avers one maxim, there isn't only one way to reach your goal. Since Mike and Sullivan aren't exactly the funny wise-crackers, all assortment of monster sidekicks not only have to arrest your glances but also elicit laughters, frankly speaking, the belly-laughing moments are not so frequent as RIO (2011, 8/10) for instance, and occasionally it loses momentum in its execution of the story, the five rounds of competition are unevenly exposed. Randy Newman's music is still uplifting and all-age friendly, but the excitement doesn't register anymore, still the brand of Pixar is aiming to a youngster-slanting demography for the sake of maximizing the profit, but the story of undergraduates and fraternity could be more nostalgic to adult audiences, its wavering standpoint may cause detriment and set a barricade to retain the golden medal as the torchbearer in the business above and beyond its unparalleled production team.",7,0,0,24 December 2013
Ben-Hur," the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era
","The newest iteration of BEN-HUR (2016) made by schlockmeister Timur Bekmambetov crashed and burned in the box-office front, which prompts my belated viewing of this grandiose historical epic under the supervision of William Wyler, the film won him a third Oscar for directing and swept with 11 wins out of its total 12 nominations (only Karl Tunberg lost BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY to Jack Clayton's ROOM AT THE TOP).Adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE Christ, this Hollywood juggernaut opens with the birth of Jesus Christ, jand condones quite a chunk of time in padding out the Calvary crucification after the iconic chariot racing money shot (which partially explains its drawn-out length, running up to 212 minutes), vehemently gets its feet wet as a Christianity- moralizing tale by casting J.C. as the Messiah who literally saves our hero Judas Ben-Hur (Heston) from perishing during his trials and tribulations, and jumps the shark in its miraculous ending, gratifyingly throws humankind's fate under the omnipresence's whims, which gives a staid aftertaste. The main plot is of course, about Judas, a wealthy Jewish prince in Jerusalem, AD 26, falls foul of his childhood friend, now a Roman tribune, Messala (Boyd), who swears allegiance to the Roman Empire, and fails to rope the freedom-advocating Judas into joining his side. Under Messala's cunning malfeasance out of a mere accident, Judas is sentenced to toil in the galleys whilst his mother Miriam (Scott) and sister Tirzah (O'Connell) are cooped up in prison. Revenge is the mainspring behind Judas' odyssey from a galley slave to an heir of the childless Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Hawkins), it is hatred that keeps his head above water against adversity, alert to a golden window to enact his exit strategy and he even magnanimously hatches a son-father rapport with the tyrannical Arrius. This is the thorny knot in the otherwise rather Manichaean racial feud depicted in the story, how far one can go to love your enemy? Which remains a quintessential challenge for those who endorse Christianity, and the film could have delved deeper into Judas' psyche on that issue, yet, Arrius wholly disappears from the narrative after the mid-stream, and he merely functions as a springboard to Judas' glorious homecoming with his rehabilitation, reunion and rediscovery. At the end of the day, justice belatedly prevails, but Judas still gets all shaken up in the aftermath, revenge might keep him alive but it is religion that gives him the ultimate peace.For what it's worth, BEN-HUR's visual spectacle still holds water to an awe-inspiring amazement and thrill, it is a historic accomplishment not just because of its cutting-edge technicalities but also for the staggering manpower it strenuously deploys, the film itself is a panegyric of human's creativity, which is something no dissenter can take away. Romans are played by a crop of top-notch British thespians, whilst Jews are mostly impersonated by Americans, although how come Hugh Griffith's ludicrously swarthy portrayal of the Arabic Sheik can walk off with that Oscar statute still eludes me, he is not even the top-pick among the supporting cast in the film, both Hawkins and Boyd can easily upstage him with their more engaging agent and emotive bravura, especially the latter, truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination which usurped by Griffith. That is not to say, Heston wins his Oscar all fair and square, but at least one can understand the logic, Heston has a dominating role whacked by an unimaginable baptism of fire, he is undeniably sympathetic and mostly affective with a very theatrical flair. An unsung heroine, is Israeli beauty Haya Harareet's divine presence as Esther, the daughter of Judah's former slave Simonides (Jaffe), and Judah's sweetheart, who livens up the scenes whenever poignancy comes into play, a classic godsend. When all is said and done, BEN-HUR is the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era, its phenomenal scale, its breathtaking grandeur and the imposingly plangent score by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa can unnerve any redux project even tries to emulate its success, and furthermore, its 'revenge is never the cure' message can earnestly transcend any religious persuasions and reach to a broader demography out of its faith-base home-turf.",8,2,2,30 November 2016
Casino Royale," Casino Royale - Bond's back, but a brand new one!
","I cannot say Daniel Craig is the best Bond because I'm not a crazy 007 fan and I have only watched previous Pierce Brosnon's 007 movies. But this film proves its a good action and unique movie.This time Bond was young and a little bit rash, he could be a typical 'Bond' gentleman with his beautiful bond girl, gambling gracefully with others in a splendent casino. Also he could fight desperately with villains like a drowned mouse. More like Bourne in 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Identity'.Actions in this flick is simple but powerful, the chasing in the beginning was breathtaking and the fight at stairway was beautifully done! The romantic parts of CR are much more than I expected, and Eva Green definitely has great chemistry with Daniel, she's a talented actress. When the ending was coming, I sighed for her death and was really sorry for young Bond. This experience taught him a good lesson and when you're served for secret services, you cannot trust anyone.The cast is quite good and love to see my goddess Judi Dench again as M, small part but a distinctive performance as usual, I like Daniel Craig in some small indie films and as Bond, he creates a different one only belongs to himself. Caterina Murino is much beautiful on screen, and I also feel sorry for her role.If you're expecting a godlike action hero, this film will disappoint you, if you want to experience a super-cool action flick with a twisted love story, this one is for you then! And I was in the middle of these two. Nowadays all the heroes are down on the earth, experiencing shock which normal person will encounter, then audience will satisfy and we all like heroes suffering. Quite weird but that's the taste of audience now.",7,2,5,3 April 2007
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3
","My original plan was to have a Toy Story trilogy orgy thoroughly in one day because I am so ashamed that I haven't watched the first two films yet, then I kept postponing the project indefinitely as not enough time could be squeezed for such a feast. So the day before yesterday I incidentally watched the third one on TV, though discontinuously, it did prompt me to watch it last night. As a sequel, TOY STORY 3 might be not as splendid or original as Pixar's recent mega-hits UP (2009) and WALL-E (2008), since in a world full of toys, there is not much room left for grandeur milieu. However the whole team behind is extraordinarily decisive and intelligent to mold every single character with respective personalities, even for the trivial sidekicks, which creatively leave indelible impressions on my mind.As a matter of fact, the mammoth success of the film is mainly the victory of a superb script from John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Michael Arndt and the director Lee Unkrich. It could effortlessly project an empathetic impact upon anyone as long as he/she could still recall his/her childhood memory, (for children of course no problem, and as for adults, the repercussions are even more vigorous, its positive messages of intrepid friendship and the soulful revelation of grow-up triumphantly moves everyone, regardless of the fact that if you have watched TOY STORY (1995) or TOY STORY 2 (1999).For the fun part, the film has numerous wisecracks and innocuous gags all along the way, the prison-break set piece is adeptly maneuvered (the hand-in-hand resolution is as affectionate as unexpected), but the real epiphany comes near the end, it's a tear-jerking moment to wave goodbye to the past, especially those are composed of happiness and joy, we all grow up like Andy, and I do yearn for my old childhood toys (mainly cartoon books though).The film is also perfect for its score (Randy Newman's We Belong Together has a fatal empathy when playing during the end credits), and all other technical aspects are arranged with Pixar- esque delicacy and accuracy (the editing and art direction particularly).The voice cast contributes the minimum wage here, but Buzz Lightyear's Spanish mode is my favorite stunt in the film, invincibly hilarious all over the globe.Ignoring this year's CARS 2, Pixar solidifies its status of representing the apex of the animation film field and what's is more precious is that they master the recipe of fabricating allegorical fairy tales which accommodate almost an entire demography and offer a perfect shelter for us, which we still can self-consciously engage ourselves into the miraculous web of contemporary films.",9,1,1,1 August 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney
","First of all, it is an absurd travesty to exclude Emma Thompson in the BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination list this year by the Academy members, she campaigned rather hard in the awards season, she is a revered two-times winner and the film is exhaustively friendly towards the academy members, considering FINDING NEVERLAND (2004, 7/10), the story behind another children classic Peter Pan. And most essentially, she is at the top of her game in depicting a quite unlikeable character, the high and mighty spinster P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins books. Under the direction of a dab hand John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE 2009, 8/10), the storyline inter-cuts between two time-lines, in the dawn of 20th century in the inland Australia, the tale of woe of Ms. Tavers' childhood and in the 60s, when she flies to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Hanks) about the adaptation of her worldly-famous creation on celluloid. The two main deal-breaking stipulations for Ms. Tavers are, the picture must not feature any music numbers, and absolutely no animation is required, which are two leading signatures of Disney's trademarks, and both will be compromised if you have seen the crowd-pleasing and massively successful MARY POPPINS (1964, 7/10). The 1960s bifurcation engages in a comical contradiction between Travers' British uppityness and the business-centered civilities of Disney and his staff, which amusingly juggles with our empathy and distaste of her, Thompson commits herself integrally with her pitch-perfect acrimony and balances it with a tint of human nature through her friendship with her limousine chauffeur Ralph (a down-to-earth Giamatti). And eventually, her hostility and aversion towards the money-seeking deal will thaw by Disney's self-referencing confession of the hardship in his boyhood. But in reality, Travers never sold off other copyrights of her works anymore after this instance, which denotes the tear-jerking scenes where she is watching the finished film during its Hollywood fanfare premier is more of a reflection and vent on her own troubled memory rather than an acknowledgment to the picture itself. Equally well done is the childhood narrative, Farrell plays Travers Goff, and we come to realize Ms. Tavers coins her nom de plume after her father, a man dreams of fantasies and lives in fairy tales, whom she nurtures a very close affection to, but life is rough, he is a chronic dipsomaniac, an irresponsible bank manager and her family is the prototype of Banks family in the book, Farrell shines with devoted warmth and poignant endearment during his sequences with the newcomer Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the young author with a nickname Ginty, it has been one of his rare compelling performances to date. Ruth Wilson implodes with a suicidal tendency as her mother, and Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie is criminally underused simply because she is THE real Mary Poppins and she is only allowed a 5-minutes part for her presence. Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney, whose subtle snootiness is brilliantly laid bare in the premier segment, when there is no need to kiss her ass, a polite cold-shoulder is all she deserves. So behind every tartar, there is a cause, the film is a success in not patronizing its audience with sugarcoating or spoon-feeding, yet in a tactful manner, it arouses empathy from within, last but not the least, it is also a treat to your ears, owing to Thomas Newman's masterful score saturated through and through.",8,0,1,30 May 2014
Jojo Rabbit," JOJO RABBIT infuses a modicum of hope and innocence in the face of inconceivable man-made horror and adversity,
","'You cannot not hark back to Roberto Benigni's well-wrought laughter/lachrymose diptych LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (1997) when you are watching JOJO RABBIT, the former (which this reviewer just re-watched recently on the big screen), albeit often too facile in its second-half concentration camp tall story, holds firmly the distinction of infusing a modicum of hope and innocence in the face of inconceivable man-made horror and adversity, and Taika Waititi's sixth feature strives for the same aim, but by dint of a droll satire embedded with a cutesy Wes Anderson-esque mise en sc√®ne.'keep reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",8,0,0,13 February 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Wes Anderson's animation competently deserves the adjective in its title
","Wes Anderson's stop-motion puppet show, adopted from Roald Dahl's beloved children novel, has evaded from me for all these years, again, I'm not an avid animation fan and particularly into children's fare, but this winsome gem can nimbly edge into my Top 10 film of the year. Mr. Fox (Clooney) used to enjoy his adventurous life as a food-stealer with Ms. Fox (Streep), but now he is a suave columnist, they have a son Ash (Schwartzman), and lead a quiet life living underground. Nevertheless, as a wild animal, Mr. Fox cannot reconciled to the quiet life which Ms. Fox urges him to hew to, he purchases a new tree house regardless of his lawyer Mr. Badger (Murray)'s persuasion because three meanest human farmers are living nearby. Later Mr. Fox's teenage nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to stay with them, whose athletic bent walks away with Mr. Fox's commendation and leaves a gauche Ash pale in comparison. Recruiting an opossum Kylie (Wolodarsky) as his aide, Mr. Fox plots one-last-raid to the three farmers' respective lands on the sly, which ultimately provokes the farmers' vengeance, lead by Franklin Bean (Gambon), the meanest of them all, and endangers other species as well. Together, animals need to use their instinct to fight back and Mr. Fox must retrieve his tail which he has lost in an ambush, now becomes a fur tie wearing by Bean as a victorious token and rescue Kristofferson who is captured as a hostage. With all the animals sport an American accent whereas the evil humans with British accent, Anderson chirpily brings the mischievous pettiness into the film's autumnal palette, the story has its whimsical focus on retaining one's natural disposition and a correct upbringing every child should receive. Visually speaking, this animation has its quintessential Andersonian opulence, its symmetrical and miniature frame arrangement promisingly augurs his auteurist consummation in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014). So is his characterisation of the assorted anthropomorphic critters, mostly foxes and rodents, and the only villain among them is Willem Dafoe voices the rat, Mr. Fox's nemesis. When Mr. Fox and his cohort meets a wolf on their way, he must overcome his deepest fear since his inherent phobia of wolves, and Anderson lends the story such a philosophical angle of exhortation, throws in conspicuous adulthood sophistication onto the family-friendly template.For those who anticipate a more dramatic showdown, Anderson doesn't accommodate itself into a traditional story-unwinding, the film doesn't end in a thorough and edge-of-the- seat payoff, alternatively, Anderson blas√© care-freeness finishes this endearing tale with a 'we want it more' note. The cast is pretty fetching, it is Clooney's first voice performance and he is plain fitting, but a quite despondent fact is that Streep can only pair with Clooney as a couple in an animation, in the world of live-action, it will never happen, not in a billion years. All in all, it is rather dismissive to category Anderson's work as a cartoon for kids, it competently deserves the adjective in its title and is a steadfast stepping stone for Anderson's propitious standing in Hollywood's hierarchy.",8,0,0,26 July 2015
Son of Saul," a harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, to the taste of Academy members
","The debut feature film from Hungarian filmmaker L√°szl√≥ Nemes, SON OF SAUL wins Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in 2016, it is a hard-nosed Holocaust drama takes a unique focal point of one particular Sonderkommando (Nazi's death camp inmates who are chosen to dispense with gas chamber victims), the Jewish-Hungarian Saul Ausl√§nder (R√∂hrig, sometimes feels stilted but overall quite an endeavor from a non-professional).From the word go, Nemes' discreet modality of entirely putting Saul at the center stage grandly comes home to the audience, starting from an out of focus shot slowly clings to its object Saul, our visual cynosure, then meticulously follows his steps (a back-of-his-head vantage point) and only shows us what is happening strictly from his prospect, it is an intriguing and contained ploy, on one hand, the film waives a holistic view of the happenings, for fear that the uncompromising atrocity it scrupulously re-enacts is too much for viewers to bear, thus mercifully we are only presented with glimpses through Saul's constant movement, who seems to be strung-out yet benumbed, most of the time, he keeps to himself; on the other hand, the skimpy scenes are no less soul-stirring, the gas chamber, piles of naked cadavers, incinerators, dumping truckloads of ashes, the rampant slaughter, the whole package is there (a sterling job for its production designer, the Hungarian architect L√°szl√≥ Rajk Jr.), selectively materializes predicated upon Saul's presence, one indubitable merit of Nemes' picture is it has miraculously re-created a reliving the horror experience that possibly errs on the side of being so vicarious that one is instinctively repelled and tries to turn away from it. That is an inextricable dilemma of any film, cinema aims to engross, however, when the subject it depicts is inherently repugnant and horrendous to a fault, as a result we are often mired between these two disparate states, a self-inflicted masochism. Is there any redeeming grace to temper the milieu's inhuman brutality and its overlaying smothering? Yes, there must be, it is Saul's spur-of-the-moment decision to carry out a proper Jewish burial for a boy who dies after barely surviving the gas chamber and whom he claims to fellow inmates is his son (is it true? the answer is deliberately moot, but one inclines to nay, which makes Saul's action more perverse and improbable, maybe he thinks the boy's ephemeral survival is a numinous call for his action), so the imperative mission for him is to find a rabbi to officiate the burial, meantime, chivvied by Abraham (Moln√°r), another Sonderkommand, he is also embroiled into an impending uprising as their last attempt to scupper their imminent doomsday, but Saul is halfhearted. Granted that Saul's intransigency gravely compromises his contribution to the nobler/righteous cause (to an extent that he will lose those precious smuggled gun powders, and volunteer his own demise just to find a rabbi during the infernal pandemonium), the film perilously threats to negate its own raison d'√™tre, which is to retain an infinitesimal trace of faith and courage to survive under such egregious monstrosities in the manifestation of defiance, Jews are being decimated, but their culture and rituals are deathless. In the end of the day, Saul's effort is futile, the rabbi he rescues is a sham, the body fails to be pushing up the daisies and when the camera finally veers from Saul after his hard-earned smile, what manifests is not a glint of hope but a consolation or a surrender only too soon will be rendered insignificant, ambiguity again takes an upper hand in this harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, for all its calculated aesthetics, its impact is confounding and its laurels are undue.",7,0,1,18 July 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Better than its predecessor
","A crammed cinema-going for the weekend is a belated diversion since not too much going on for the past month in the burgeoning Chinese market. The chapter one THOR (2011, 5/10) and the mega-amalgam THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10) didn't lure me into Thor's fan base, but this sequel does boost the franchise's morals by further intermingling the epic apocalypse between the vast Gods' realm and the puny but ego-maniacal earth, saw it in its over-charged 3D version (nearly impossible to find a 2D screening nearby), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is a massive crowd- pleaser, terrific art production and the trappings of a Marvel vehicle, shrewdly fictionalizes the love-and-hatred bromance between Thor and Loki, which is much hyped as the dominant draw for this action-packed escapade. There is darkness before the birth of the universe, so as to against the plot of Malekith (Eccleston) to utilize an amorphous weapon called Aether to set the universe back into pitch- blackness, Thor (Hemsworth) has to team up with Loki (Hiddleston) to rescue his earth girlfriend Jane (Portman) who has been infected by Aether and being pursed by Malekith and his toadies, notably, a mutated fiend Algrim (Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Whiling the most entertaining part comes the polarized tenors of the Asgard kingdom and the contemporary earth, one is solemn, majestic, atavistic and Shakespearean (thanks to Kenneth Branagh for setting the tone in THOR 2011) and the other (this time the locale is an overcast London) is glossy, modern, farcical and doomed to be pulverized. The spectacles are generally gratifying and on a par with the earlier IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10) to say the least. Wonderful comic relief from the earthbound trio, Dennings, Skarsg√É¬•rd and Howard plus a surprising cameo by O'Dowd. Hemsworth and Portman are predictably playing the hero and his fearless girlfriend-in-danger default while Hiddleston easily grabs all the attention by influencing meatier character development, more ambiguous in his stance and a timely twist in the end can suffice to ignite fans' passion to the next installment, or maybe a Loki-based spin- off which will be more intriguing and anti-trend in its own way. By any means it is a solid sequel which inherits the merits from its predecessor and put more verve into its gods vs. mortals contradiction, director Alan Taylor has well handled a hot potato, next step, sit and wait for CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014) coming this upcoming April. ",7,0,2,11 November 2013
Lucy," Besson needs more brain capacity to make this film shine
","A cinema-going in a newly-discovered multiplex in Cairo inside a half-empty shopping mall, LUCY is another rare triumph of a female-driven blockbuster directed by Gallo-film entrepreneur Luc Besson, whose creativity and clout has been significantly ebbed away after THE BIG BLUE (1988, 8/10), L√âON: THE PROFESSIONAL (1994, 9/10) and THE FIFTH ELEMENT (1997, 8/10). So I have been intentionally steering clear of his subsequent work, however recently the noteworthy career renaissance of Scarlett Johansson intrigues me immensely and I am tempted by the conception of gearing up the the maximum of human's cerebral capacity. But, in the end, Besson overkills the idea since his brain capacity doesn't quite hit the requirement to facilitate such an ambitious project. The Taipei setting is a treat to my eyes, and it is also refreshing to watch Black Widow acting frightened as a girl in the end of her tether (at least for the beginning 20 minutes) before she can wondrously kick ass again. The montages of an antelope falling prey of ferocious lions are not too subtle to inter-cut with the pretentious and preposterous beginning. We are not watching a Discovery channel while the reconstructed images of the arguable first homo sapiens Lucy cannot be too obvious to state its liaison with our Lucy, brings about a THE TREE OF LIFE (2011, 8/10) otherworldliness, but in a far worse way. The same out-of-the-place malaise continues until the very end, the flashy progress of the drug flowing through brain cells and the Sci-Fi transcendent set pieces jump in not as eye-opening thrust, but mostly middle-of-the-road scratches. By comparison, the paralleling plot of the vengeful Korean gang leader seems to be even more insignificantly trivial, only to meet the eyes of action fans. The second-billed Morgan Freeman's subplot is also mediocrely plain, he might as well retreat as a suave elucidator in voice-over; Min-sik Choi, the South Korean mega-star, monotonously designed as the blood-thirsty thug, but against the superhuman Lucy, his one-note villain is pitifully expendable. Johansson, on the other hand, basically carries the picture alone, but after the tremendous metamorphosis in HER (2013, 8/10) and UNDER THE SKIN (2013, 8/10), LUCY is a child's play for her, she doesn't even have to challenge many stylish action showcases as in CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10). But in any rate, LUCY marks that she successfully repeats Angelina Jolie's victory in SALT (2010), the film is a solid stepping stone to manifest that she is a bankable leading actress who is ready to anchor a Black Widow spin off now, Marvel really should seize this opportunity and right their wrongs in the sexism superhero universe. Luc Besson, once a French wunderkind with great promise, now it only seems that his ambition oversteps his actual execution. The storytelling of LUCY is arbitrary and reckless, what is in its center notion of any individual human's 100% prowess liberation is clearly beyond his own comprehension, so he has to finish it off in a most predictable approach, it is a too profound test for him to justify the story. Anyway, being the mastermind behind a popcorn flick, he is no doubt a shrew businessman and knows the market pretty well.One funny thing is the ending could be a suitable preface for HER or UNDER THE SKIN, when Lucy has been transformed into either an omnipresent IOS system, or even worse, a completely different species trying to get some basic clue of the highest life form on earth, if you are a Johansson fan, it is not a bad choice for a double bill.",5,2,8,2 September 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Moonrise Kingdom
","My fourth Wes Anderson film, a 2D cinema-going, the previous three are THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001, a 7/10), THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU (2004, an 8/10) and THE DARJEELING LIMITED (2007, a 6/10). With its burgeoning domestic box-office performance (a $38.8M by last week, only second to THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, which cashed in around 52M in the whole run), MOONRISE KINGDOM has a chance to be elevated into the weighty consideration as the BEST PICTURE contender in the Oscar race for the first time for Mr. Anderson, and a more potent edge is that it has gathered his idiosyncratic innovative creativity and incubates it with a fairly engaging story, therefore it can be conceived as his most developed and fully grown work to date. Apart from Anderson's regular troupe (Murray and Schwartzman), newcomers here are copious with Hollywood renowned names, Willis, Norton, McDormand, Swinton, Keitel and Balaban. But they are merely screen foils, the film revolves around a teenager duo, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, as the premature elopers. The storyline is nothing particularly extraordinary, it is Anderson's paradigmatic trump cards, the simplistic design, colorful costumes plus a generally reddish palette, the distinctive horizon-and-vertical moving shots cum a fast-paced editing, the unorthodox charisma of its characters (a poke-faced Kara is an inward-distraught rebel while a nerd-looking Jared is a boldly underage adventurer), all above are propelling the film as the slipstream through its cerebrally entertaining and visually bombarding ride with prudence and detailed quirkiness. In the film, the adult characters are mainly sidelined and mockingly immature, juxtaposed with our young-but-steady runaways, the disparity could not be more overt. But the film is more than a modern fairytale, its sleek and trendy predisposition has an innate crowd-pleasing trait, especially at this time, all the fantasies and puppy love stories have been marred by violence (the ubiquitous bullies) and darkness (Tim Burton needs to burn more cash and vampires need love too since undead is boring), Anderson's children-like temperament may find a fertile soil to bloom, arguable, killing a doggie and struck by thunder are appropriate to the pre-teen audience, but what the hell anyway, his territory is always open to adults who linger with a ingenuous heart.",8,0,2,3 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A safe choice for J.J. Abrams
","The long-awaited seventh episode of STAR WARS is apparently shattering the opening weekend box-office record all over the place, a decade after the prequel trilogy and more than 30 years after the original trilogy. The anticipation is understandably high, since this iconic franchise has been transferred to Disney and under the helm of J.J. Abrams, this first instalment in a new trilogy is self-evidently decisive to reboot the story and carry on the mantle to both gratify hardcores and new audience.Saw it in the local multiplex in its 3D-format, Episode 7 is a generically formulaic effort, plays the safety card with viewers' nostalgia, one step a time, introduces back the core human-trio from the original trilogy, while builds a similar 'destroy-a-much-bigger-Death-Star' plot for the next generation, freshly, this time, our protagonist is a girl named Rey (the star-making role for the new- comer Ridley), whose inherited prowess to control the force is exponentially stronger than Luke Skywalker (Hamill) in the original, befriends with a defected storm trooper Finn (Boyega) and gets acquainted with Han Solo (Ford) and Chewbacca (Mayhew), when they steers the run-down Millennium Falcon. A key plot device is Luke's whereabout, who has disappeared as the last Jedi. After Rey being captured by Kylo Ren (Driver), the son of Solo and Princess Leia (Fisher), who joined the dark side and becomes a commander of THE FIRST ORDER, governed by Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis). Finn, Solo and Chewbacca infiltrate inside the Starkiller Base (a.k.a. a much bigger Death Star), whereas a fleet lead by the Resistance pilot Poe (Isaac), attacks from outside.The same-old patricide complex again is inevitably exploited as the biggest plot-twist here (someone has taken the same route from Alec Guinness and Liam Neeson, as another victim of ageism in the franchise), but Adam Driver, valiantly saves the clich√© from being over-dramatic and masks a discernible ambiguity in Ren's psychology, more impressively, Driver is the MVP among a melange of old-faces and new blood, whose malicious appearance and undecipherable temperament eclipse the one-dimensional cardboard characterisation plagued the rest of the cast (save our heroine, maybe).As one can assure from a J.J. Abrams' vehicle, the picture is visually enterprising, and extensively restores the less florid palette and vast settings of the originals other than the more recent prequels, but on a minus side, the homage to the original also hampers Abrams' imagination, as inviting as the grotesque tableaux vivants in planet Takodana - where our protagonists encounter Maz Kanata (Nyong'o incognito), the keeper of Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, the blatant repetition doesn't taste better in a second time, and using the same strategy, the Resistance successfully levels the base as Luke did in STAR WARS (1977), which shamefully attests, villains never learn.Afterwards, gratifyingly, we don't have to wait to see Luke until the next episode, but cunningly, the film leaves us the biggest question mark in our mind about Rey's identity, is she Luke's daughter? or Leia's? We have a two-year span to wait for the answer, is this the sadness of being a Star War loyalty? OK, who cares!",7,4,21,20 December 2015

","I do have no idea this film is another adaption from a comic series, Retired Extremely Dangerous, a group of retired special agents vs. a wipe-out scheme. It is highly tantalizing for me to see Dame Helen Mirren shooting machine guns in her blonde hair, maybe the trailer should take the blame as it is a bit misleading, the film turns out to be just another plain comedy with a little piece of action, which is far from meeting my satisfaction, I don't regret to watch the film, but after a second afterthought, the film is too mediocre with many details worth deeper excavating.The cast is my primary reason to watch the film, however, nothing is pleasantly surprised, John Malkovich is as insane as a scene stealer (whose role is to offer comic elements), Bruce Willis is the only action star, who had undertaken the sole close combat with Karl Urban in the middle of the film. The loving couple Helen Mirren and Brian Cox serve as sidekicks alone, poor Mary-Louise Parker gave a safe performance which barely suits her character as the love interest of Bruce. The villain Richard Dreyfuss looks like an older version of Leonard in THE BIG BANG THEORY. As for Morgan Freeman, he was hardly there in the film. The film was nominated for the Best Comedy/Musical Film in the Golden Globe this year, which had ironically proved how ridiculous the Golden Globe could be, even the notorious BURLESQUE and THE TOURIST (2010) also got the nominations in the same category. I must say it is a major flaw to lose its creditability. Given the fact I don't think highly of this film, I do appreciate the idea of the retired fighting back to get their pride and save the world. Maybe a possible sequel will have some improvement.",6,1,3,3 February 2011
Flight," Flight
","Welcome back Robert Zemeckis after his actor-animation capture ventures, FLIGHT heralds his first time return to a real live feature after a dozen years. Great relief he is still excelling in instructing a debatable moral tale with a back-to-his-top-form two-times Oscar-winner Denzel Washington. The narration has its gradual and clock-wise temp in scrutinizing a heroic pilot's personal quagmire after landing a doomed-to-be-crashed plane with minimum casualty by virtue of his alcoholic addiction (what's worse is the fact that he was cockeyed even when he was at the helm during that dreadful accident). From a legitimate angle, although his valorous action deserves raves from the mass, and the pivotal cause of the accident largely lies in an outdated plane part, he still unavoidably should assume his liability. There is no ambiguity in whether or not he should get away with it, and eventually the case evolves into a self- awakening resolution to reshuffle one's life from his damned addiction (there is a more-than- enough trek leading into the thematic revelation, thanks to Washington's instinctive charisma, if falls into other thespian's palm, which would induce an over-dramatic and self-conscious bravura just to appease the good-over-evil expectation from well-prepared audience. The final twist is histrionic but Danzel's telling confession is superbly visceral even though has been fermented overlong. The Kelly Reilly tributary also negotiates through an engrossing damsel in mistress plight, until it emerges (a shade bluntly) with the main narrative, prompts the salvation-evoking meeting between a compulsive and recurrent drunkard and an inveterate junkie, it is not a fatalist love story of LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995, 8/10) although neither of them is another's messiah. Ms. Reilly, a rather under-used British actress, after many years of endeavor in Hollywood, finally grabs a much meatier role in a mainstream flick and she is never daunted by Washington's suffocating presence, infuses a secular savor tallies with the formatively square film. Robert Zemeckis shoots the most matter-of-fact airplane crashing process except the final collision, when CGI unavoidably reveals its tail, but the film stands unyieldingly on its ground as a preachifying morale parable, its motley spectators will never feel being offensive when it tries too much and many clich√© settings keep hopping up, anyhow it is a laudable feat from Zemeckis, whom I feel spontaneously send my tip of advice (definitely I'm not a loner here), stopping meddling with the pricey animation gizmos and going back to the fertile soil where germinates FORREST GUMP (1994, 9/10)",7,1,1,5 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","It all ended today, normally I am not a nostalgic type, but Harry Potter series have accompanying me through my entire 20s, which I am not certain whether is my brightest decade or not, nevertheless it represents the end of an era!Compared with Part One, apart from a couple of minutes in the beginning, Part Two is sheer an awe-inspiring expedition, 120 minutes without any chance to slow down the pace until the final one-to-one duel between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The Potter-trio dominates the whole film throughout, which inevitably leaves no enough room for other wizards showcasing their heroic stunts (for example, Remus Lupin even died without any segmental flashback of what actually happened, merely serves as an augment to the number of the casualty), Neville Longbottom is the only exception (due to my ignorance of the original books, it came across as quite a surprise), all other students and professors are sympathetic cameos, all of which symbols a way of contrived reunion and also a farewell to the aficionados for their years-long faithfulness. The interconnection inside the trio is dealt with less dexterity in order to accomplish the apocalyptic denouement, nevertheless when Ron and Hermione pair finally come out of their puppy love closet, it feel so overdue and gratified, and the gallantry of the entire Hogworts is foreseeable but encouraging!The 3D effect is much better this time (maybe I was sitting in a smaller screening room, the vividness is more tangible and the screen is brighter). Anyway, as the series finale, I can express my satisfaction to the film, what's more shall we expect from a children-book sensation? Finally, I must give Alan Rickman some accolade and suggest a potential Oscar nomination might not be a pipe dream (maybe not for this film only, if the Academy intends to honor the whole series, it will has the best shot), Severus Snape is without any doubt the most charismatic character and Alan himself is the most underrated British actor since his debut in DIE HARD (1988). ps. The 19 years later make-up is a sort of ridicule, how can we forget their youth just in a fleet of seconds after the long trek we have been through?",8,0,0,7 August 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Chapter two is a notch below the first chapter
","THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10) is a harbinger of another monolith box-office knockout with quite different teen spirit from TWILIGHT franchise. Its dystopian milieux strike as a resounding backbone to carry its social onus which is unusual to be seen among its peers. As the second part of the trilogy-turns-quartet (a lame strategy when shifts from the source novel to its cinematic adaption), CATCHING FIRE basically is an amped-up survival battle as its predecessor (with an elaborate overture to dovetail its storyline development), new helmer Francis Lawrence (I AM LEGEND 2007, 8/10; CONSTANTINE 2005, 7/10) barely achieves a middle-of-the-road tactic to fulfill his demanding task.Since I tend to divide movie from its source material, I am a piece of blank paper towards the plot and its characters' ominous destiny, so the great pleasure comes from newcomers (name- checking Sam Claflin and Jena Malone) in the series since it did pique my curiosity to know whether they will survive in the end, both actors are camera-friendly and vividly evoke laughters and empathy. So tracking back to the love triangle, Hemsworth's part is tapering down quickly meanwhile J. Lawrence and Hutcherson manage to breakout from their asymmetrical relationship, although judging from all levels, she looks like a big sister (and caretaker) to him, but which also accomplishes an unorthodox heroine and hero pair against all odds. Tucci and Banks are as excellent as they could be with their flamboyant antics, while veteran Sutherland and Harrelson are unequivocally underemployed as the antagonist and the mentor respectively, plus the new blood Hoffman doesn't seem to exhaust too much effort to accentuate the final twist. So it all strips down to Jennifer Lawrence's emotional curve out and out, save her swaying affections towards two boys, her awakening sense as a token of rebellion trudges through a laboriously-designed victories' tour, which also gives Katniss (passively though) a strong conviction what will become her goal in the chapters to come, the great part of the story has just begun! I watched it on an IMAX screen, and the effect is no more than satisfactory, during the game time, the CGI looks cheaper and faker than usual top-notch Hollywood output, the entire hue is also a shade darker in view of its 2D default, one can barely get the full idea what is happening during the high points. Brightness aside, the definition of the images is another disappointing factor. So maybe one crucial reason (my own conspiracy theory) is that the cinemas' apparatus is not equivalent between here in Shanghai and in USA, where it gained raving reviews, but as far as I am concerning, the technique bloopers are too blatant to overlook, markedly mar the movie for me, but I will keep as loyal as possible for the remaining two successors (both will still be under the tiller of Francis Lawrence), just because Julianne Moore is on board now as a key role, god bless the mockingjay!",6,5,18,27 November 2013
Looper," a smart idea, but not well executed!
","Rian Johnson's third feature, the second one stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the leading role, after his career debut detective-noir BRICK (2005, 6/10), however his second film THE BROTHERS BLOOM (2008, 6/10) has lost its traction with both the audience and the critics, in spite of a scale-up budget and cast.I saw this film in the local multiplex, and my expectation had been drastically kindled thanks to its great reviews in its domestic reign (especially after a season mainly consists of summer leftovers and studio's substandard cranked-outs), although I'm no big fan of Rian's past work, and consider him as the next Christopher Nolan might spoil him through excessive enthusiasm (also, to juxtapose this time-travel vehicle with the monolithically staggering INCEPTION, 2010, 9/10 is not such a grounded idea at all).The milieu of a dystopian future with a darker and more desolate vantage view is not a novel gambit it the Sci-Fi genre, the film also is wanting the budget to exhibit its ambitious future world, basically the film hinges on a quite groundbreaking caveat, the requisite existence of 'the loopers', which is a somewhat moot point (it's rather difficult to be convinced the future criminals will make such a big fuss to illegally dispose the dead bodies with the omnipotent time machine, which triggers another more pertinent point, why not kill first, transfer later?), so all of these unsolved questions have kind of deglamorized the film per se. But honestly speaking, if one can drop the feeble premise, the film is potently entertaining, especially in the latter part, when all the Sci-Fi stunts turns into a supernatural thriller. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has slowly but firmly established his own fan base and although almost ruined by the ridiculous make-up (I don't buy the resemblance of him and Bruce Willis no matter what 30 years could alter a person), all he needs is a meaty role to send him into the upper stratum as like Christian Bale or Joaquin Phoenix. Emily Blunt gives an impressively gritty performance with her southern American accent (for me it's rather disparate from her usual comfort zone, but I am no American, so I don't have the say whether it is accurate or not), a hard-bitten motherhood is always a rite-of-passage for young actresses when they (infinitely) reach 30. Paul Dano is technically wasted in the film, so are Rian's old buddies Jeff Daniels, Noah Segan is too goofy to be taken seriously. An unexpected discovery is the young boy Pierce Gagnon, a big bravo for him to nail the most demanding work in the film.",6,1,2,21 October 2012
Casino," After movies - Casino
","A Martin Scorsese's film, casting with his longtime partner Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, like another 'Goodfellas'. This time the story is about Casino, but mobster is still an indispensable part of it.The film began with a car bomb and then flashed back to how Sam carved out his way in the casino business, how he desperately kept the balance between business and his mobster background. At the same time, this film emphasized his unsuccessful relationship with his wife, Ginger. Which is quite unusual in a Scorsese film because most of his films female characters are just ornaments. But this time, Ginger (played by Sharon Stone) is indisputably the leading actress in Casino.Violence is another important ingredient of this film, torture, beating, bombing and killing, all to bring forth the cruelty of the living world. If you're a typical Scorsese's fan, you will love it.The accurate and realistic depiction of Casino business is also remarkable. The colorful world filled with gambling, cheating and hustling. But all gamblers are losers, the only winner is the casino itself. Business is business, making profit is the ultimate goal. When Sam had made great fortune by running the casino, he wanted to be a normal businessman and didn't want to be involved into mobsters anymore. But it was difficult to quit because he had already made the countless ties with them. When it concerns with benefits, it's not a thing one man can decide anymore.Talking abut the actors, I have to admit that Sharon Stone is wonderful in this film, her only Oscar-nominated role by far. But there is something I must complain about, that is the role of Ginger, which is so stupidly written, she was just a mindless Blondie who only wanted to marry a rich man to enjoy a luxury life. We don't blame her for that, nevertheless how could she be so in love with James Wood's role is beyond redemption and totally unconvincing! Maybe the answer is either me or Martin Scorsese does not understand women at all. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci's acting are some kind of continuing of their roles in 'Goodfellas', good but far from excellent.This film is not Scorsese's best work and Sharon Stone shines in her bitter and badly-written role.",7,2,3,20 June 2007
Life," We need to talk about Calvin
","We need to talk about Calvin, the first evidence of extraterrestrial life, a single cell collected from Mars (named by one of earth children through space to earth live beaming), is retrieved by a six- member crew in the International Space Station in director Daniel Espinosa's ALIEN + GRAVITY hybridization, LIFE, a by-the-number claustrophobic space-capsule horror, hits every blas√© note in its story development, so much so that, the only twist crops up in its anti-climatic ending, but by that point, audience's interest is virtually evaporated.As a moderately budgeted Sci-Fi thriller (around $ 58 million), the film's open gambit is its expansive space shots patterning after GRAVITY, but less awe-inspiring by default. The crew's initially effusive atmosphere is soon dissipated when they find out that Calvin, a fast growing creature embodies a (unsurprising) tentacular form, evolving into an indestructible predator with high intelligence, where the high-minded crew members are being singled out one by one as its sustenance. When eventually it is down to our two protagonists Dr. David Jordan (Gyllenhaal), the American senior medical officer and Dr. Miranda North (Ferguson), the British Quarantine Officer (not that Japanese father, who has never met his newborn daughter; or the Russian captain, or the black biologist), to preclude Calvin from reaching our homeland, a bold plan is propounded with true grit and self-sacrifice, but when all bets are off, can lesser mortals truly outmaneuver Calvin, a shorthand of the universe's oceanic profoundness, inscrutability and threat? As mediocre as the final product is - the script is painfully by rote (although it is a fair surprise to kill off a name star as the first casualty, I guess the paycheck is not fat enough); all six characters are bland, stand-up guys who are more than willing to die for others when the crunch arrives, no personal complex is unearthed to compound their danger, thus, we have no one to blame but Calvin, a conglomeration of intelligence and primitivity (it can outguess its human rivals in every step but cannot stay put for a minute to fight against its predatory instinct); the score is plain pedestrian while its slithering cinematography being predominantly curbed by the set's limited space. - time and again, LIFE does forewarn us in the face of unknown mystery, we shouldn't get too psyched, as broken-easily as we are, we might just as well prepare ourselves fully for the worst scenario.",6,9,17,27 March 2017
50_50," 50/50
","A dramedy about cancer is a proper hard-sell in the market, this wee budget film (although JGL and Seth Rogan are quite bankable names among their peers) has done a quite solid battle in the box-office last year (domestic total gross is $35 million against its $8 million budget), due to its very heartfelt closeness and touchingness of its concoction of the three- faceted narrative (love, friendship and family) revolving around our young protagonist who has been through an ordeal of a very rare spine cancer. Adopted from a true event of the screenwriter Will Reiser (who is a close friend of Rogen and takes on an ephemeral cameo too), the film has a rare pluck and daintiness in reciting the story from a very earthly perspective, no flamboyant hyperbole, the plot goes through a carefully measured but innately captivating melodrama (although the big question of the survival of the operation had never been doubted, the bare truth is the screenwriter himself is still alive!), it could be reckoned as a sequel of (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, 8/10), JGL continues to generate his congenial drawing power through the rough road of a young man's battle with the malignant tumour, most of the time, he exercises a pleasingly lifelike mechanism to embody himself to his character without showing off the edginess and dominance which could be easily sensed. Seth Rogen mainly serves as a crude but kind- hearted friend (still too coarse with his sex-oriented jokes). Anna Kendrick is another mainstay of the film, utterly adorable and convincing as the rookie shrink, slightly uptight but accurately vivid (she is among my top 5 list of best supporting actress and JGL is inside my top 10 list of best leading actor). Ms. Howard again (after THE HELP, 2011, 8/10) finds herself in a very dislikable role, hope her career path will not be pigeonholed into the 'bitch' category; Anjelica Huston, this time is quite far from her usual majesty, instead renders her prowess to manage a less glamorous presentation of a nagging but loving mother. Director Jonathan Levine's next film is the new TWILIGHT wannabe WARM BODIES (2013), one should feel confident that at least it will catch up with the closeness and touchingness in spite of over-exploiting the (vampire) zombie-cum-romance territory.",8,0,0,9 November 2012
Deadpool," a timely trendsetter for the jaded superhero genre
","Ryan Reynolds' much hyped anti-hero, DEAD POOL finally bags his own feature film, seven years after his first-appearance in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), and it becomes the latest box- office phenomenon, both domestically and internationally. What are the odds it is against? Firstly, its R-rate manifestly shows the guts to forfeit the increasingly important (profit-wise) Chinese market (the same as last year's MAD MAX: FURY ROAD 2015), and still profits; secondly, it has been dumped to a lousy February release signifies either that the production company doesn't have high hopes for it, or much more commendably, a left-field strategy to ignite the heat from the rock bottom; last but not least, its modest budget, estimated $58 millions, is significantly lower than any major studio superhero commodities, which promises a higher rate of return and indicates a new franchise is in the offing.DEADPOOL is director Tim Miller's feature debut, and it punchily and timely injects a paradigm- shifting novelty into Hollywood's mainstay genre where Marvel and DC Comics reside. From the stop-motion and self-mocking opening credits backing with ANGEL OF THE MORNING, viewers are induced to get enchanted by this unorthodox and loquacious mutant, his trademark breaking-the- fourth-wall (at one time it multiples up to sixteenth) interactions are tremendously entertaining, not to mention the ceaseless gags (its teasing victims vary from pop culture, comic book characters, showbiz celebrities, to the protagonist Reynolds himself), salacious innuendos, pulpy slaughters and gallows humour, which all dampen the pretty dark and grisly happenings of how Wade Wilson, a mercenary suffers from cancer eventually becomes Deadpool, a defaced super-human with impeccable healing powers.Surprisingly, the plot itself is a conventional boy-meets-girl, boy-leaves-girl, then boy-saves-girl three-act, and the British villain Ajex (Skrien), has no ambitious agenda to destroy the world or humanity, he is simply sadistic and enjoys beating the pulp out of his opponent or being battered since he has lost all the feelings, where Deadpool's recovery ability makes him a perfect rival. Noticeably, due to its budget, the movie doesn't involve too many exorbitant WTF visual spectacles, and action pieces are quite numbered, Deadpool's only mutant allies are the preachy Colossus (voiced by Kapicic), and a young Sinead O'Connor lookalike Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Hilderbrand), still, he beats Ajex, who has just one sidekick, Angel Dust (Carano, the girl who can fight but cannot act). Yet, the outcome is mostly rewarding, especially when viewers appetite has been pampered with too many bombardments.Reynolds spares no effort in showing off his ripped bod and pulls off Deadpool's unusually audience-friendly character, it is a long-waited recognition and hopefully his career will steer to a new direction. Wade's love interest Vanessa (Baccani), whose mutant background has been omitted here, is the only one who plays with a straight-face to at least verify the slightly uninspiring storyline, whereas T.J. Miller's Weasel, triumphantly upstages others with his competence as a constant purveyor of comic relief.The sequel has already been put on the agenda, so as a trend-setter, DEADPOOL sets up a new double-wining (both word-of-mouth and box office performance) template for studio franchises and a high bar for its follow-ups, let's wish it is not just a flash in the pan.",7,5,19,20 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas
","If the source novel from David Mitchell is claimed to be 'the most impossible one to be adapted to a feature film', the true grit behind the director trio alone merits some accolade. But the critical box-office feedback firmly suggests they will never retrieve the gargantuan budget (over 100,000,000$ for production and nothing else), while being under the barrage of divisive reviews from the critics, an ominous pre-watch hunch could never be dissolved until I finally watched it on the super-big screen (not as large as an IMAX) in the cinema, and I must confess it comes out far 'stunning' than I had expected.Graphically bountiful visual stunts of 6 inter-linked stories which stretch across different eras (from primitive tribe to a clone-ed future world) certainly has paid off its lengthy running time, 172 minutes passed by fleetingly with more anticipation was still hanging there when the ending credits inconveniently started to roll. CLOUD ATLAS is a cleverly designed omnibus, using same actors playing multiple roles in different sub-stories, consistently establishes a sense of reincarnation and an almost sacred disposition to influence a more elusive and conscience-contingent point-of-view into its viewer's subliminal comprehension. While being unfamiliar with David's novel, a first viewing may impede myself from a more comprehensive understanding of the various characters' inner liaisons, at least, it has accomplished a diverting and edifying piece of cannon to channel any soul willing to yield to a cobweb of myths and karma.But, as one would expect from exploiting an astronomical range and sophisticated plot- piling, the sub-stories unfortunately have an uneven exhibition, to divide individually, Jim Broadbent's breaking out of the home-for-the-elderly is the jolliest of all; the ill-fated destiny of Ben Wishaw's prodigy composer has much more pathos than other episodes; Halle Berry's contemporary thriller of an individual fighting the evil energy company is the stalest and has an uncertain bathos in the end; the troubled tribesman Tom Hanks's prophesy adventure in the bleak future has an insidious devil inside to conquer while his more civilized outer-space allies has a more straightforward mission to ignite; the sea journey of Jim Burgess' young lawyer in the 19th century has its suspense hanging until a hackneyed rescue from a black slave; Doona Bae's anti-Neo (the savior) sacrifice has the most transcendent visual tactic to rally its award-worthy buzz but the reverberations of the doctrinal speech is a moot point. Actors-wise, Jim Broadbent is superbly versatile apart from his usual comic comfort zone, who is my current Supporting Actor win and Ben Whishaw could never miss his chance to embroider a heartrending story with his own vulnerability and pure devotion. Doona Bae has to tackle with a much more difficult role as the robo-clone, but out of her poker-faced complexion, her key show comes off wonderfully and very much dilutes any deja-vu suspicions of her episode. So, ending my review in one sentence, CLOUD ATLAS is an epic venture with (quite a few) narrative clich√©s, but is still able to make most of Hollywood commodities pale in comparison.",8,1,3,2 December 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A high bar for entertaining blockbusters
","A weekend cinema-outing of this slick UK spy actioner which is a surprisingly excellent revamped Bond-esque espionage genre fare inundated with polished set pieces and beguiling plot twist albeit the whole movie is ground in the same old saving-the-world-from- a-super-villain mode. Director Matthew Vaughn has been constantly on my radar as one of my favourite genius in commercial filmmaking, I have watched all his previous four features, from LAKE CAKE (2004, 6/10), X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10), to my absolute guilty-pleasure treasures STARDUST (2007, 9/10) and KICK-ASS (2010, 9/10). His latest is by all means a thoroughly engaging adventure with unconventional violence and visual gags, which all delightfully surpass viewer's expectation. So, Kingsman is a secret British spy organisation with agents all suited-up in a refined and old-fashioned cavalier comportment to fight the evil minds. After losing one of their top asset Lancelot (Davenport), the headquarter, presided by Arthur (Caine), decides to recruit a new agent from promising youngsters, one of the recruits is Eggsy (Egerton), an unpolished street kid under the aegis of Harry Hart aka. Galahad (Firth), one of the top Kingsman who is indebted to Eggsy's deceased father, also a former Kingsman. During the boot camp, Eggsy befriends another recruit Roxy (Cookson), as the world is going to experience a holocaust schemed by a billionaire and radical elitist Valentine (Jackson) through his free SIM cards distributed to every corner of the globe. While all the rich and famous are privileged to survive in the new Noah's Ark constructed by Valentine, as long as they are conceded to implant a chip into their brains so that Valentine can have the full reign over them. In general, it is a partisan aggression to counteract the swelling global population which will endanger the entire human race. In hindsight, this execution is the major weak link in this otherwise inventive script, it is far more efficient to annihilate his targets if Valentine can simply detonate the self-explosion program designed in his SIM cards, if he could and should have been a bit more clever and as we all know, the chosen scenario is only to make the movie apparently dazzling for its special effects. It is a no-brainer that Valentine's plan is doomed to founder in a typical last second endgame to maintain the suspense on the high-point, but Vaugh and his co-writer Jane Goldman gallantly deploy a take-no-prisoners manoeuvre to outrun audience's common sense of 'we don't need to worry about our heroes, as Bond will never die in the movie', more impressive, it is the work of visual department, from the grand opening aerial shot, the highly-entertaining action-in-suit and swift parkour, to the adrenaline-surging church massacre in a stylish and perfectly coordinated slow-mo technique, and the final game-changing heads-will-explode firework, they are all high-end spectacles can suffice audience of today. Plus the movie has moderately good humour, it salutes without descending into snobbishness when tries to reanimate the nobleman brand of espionage. Colin Firth finally finds himself in a box-office gainer in the nadir of his post-Oscar bad career choices, and he is great here too, even in the action sequences, he should go on a profitable path as the noble version of Liam Neeson in the middle-aged killing-machine type. Newcomers Egerton and Cookson are genially well-chosen in the rookie plot-setting, but they do not exhibit ample allure to lead in a sequel all by themselves, so I guess some big name can still wait for his casting call. Also Mark Strong takes a hefty task in the game, first as a ruthless trainer, then a valiant pilot, an omnipotent computer hacker, and a professional ass-kicker. But the most indelible character is Sofia Boutella's Gazelle, Valentine's hench-woman, an extremely dangerous double amputee killer. Ultimately the film lifts the bar of our appreciation of heavy-budgeted blockbuster, and sends a defiant message for the cutting-edge industry to emulate.",8,2,9,16 March 2015
Easy A," Easy A
","This high school comedy was a dark house last year and earned more than 80 million dollars in the box office in North America alone. It stars the new girlfriend of Spiderman Emma Stone as a modern THE SCARLET LETTER tale happened in high school without any vulgar slapstick which frequently reoccur in the recent comedies worked as set pieces. The tug-war between rumors and reputations is always tricky not only to teenagers. The film has a star-studded supporting cast, including Oscar nominees Thomas, Patricia and Stanley, as well as Lisa Kudrow, who surprisingly had a slightly repugnant role. Patricia and Stanley as the liberal parents does manifest a great affecting love and rapport with their children (the quirky respond to the adaption question), which is the most precious achievement of the film, deserves a standing ovation. Emma Stone is adorable in her first leading role, which earned her an Golden Globe nomination this year, her hoarse voice does distinguish her from other cheesy hot chicks and her personal temperament is perfect for her character, like it is emphasized in the film, the film reminds us of 80's teenage films made by the late John Hughes, time flies, nostalgia becomes the new trend, for example, the unrecognizable Amanda Bynes, I miss SHE'S THE MAN (2005) even though she is only 24 now. It is a big comfort to see a fresh teenage comedy focused on a high school girl instead of the popular nerdy geeks, and I do foresee a brighter future for Ms. Emma Stone.",7,0,1,1 February 2011
Fast Five," Fast Five
","Frankly speaking, I was unforeseen that this adrenal-driven car-chasing franchise had have such a longevity during this decade since THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS in 2001 (neither am I an automobile zealot). Now here arrives the fifth installment, which surprisingly has unequivocally became the best of the series (quite rare when it comes terms with sequels). One ground rule is that the team behind knows exactly what their audience's hearts want and exaggerates it to a breathtaking effect, e.g. several vintage-model cars (which I am sheerly ignorant of), brawny men bare fist combat (Vin and Dwayne, which makes Paul Walker looks more wooden and sulky), a mission-impossible scheme, a tint of romantics and sexy appeal using its hottie female cast (Gal Gadot, again, the former Miss Israel), and the most essential one, a prolonged vehicle-chase with its eye-popping collateral damage, which is the ace in the hole!Setting against a Rio de Janeiro backdrop, the second time this year after the successful animation RIO among Hollywood A-list blockbusters, director Justin Lin (who was also behind the wheels of the 3rd and 4th film) shrewdly maneuvers an OCEAN ELEVEN mode heist plot to bolster the intensive impulsion of the rapid tempo. Plus the visual effect is high-end enough to coerce me to neglect the implausibility of certain details. My eyes are satisfied while my brain cannot find anything to whine about at all once (during the afterthought, there are plenty of bugs there though), so one sure thing is that FAST FIVE has set a new beacon for the Hollywood mega-budgeted action films, it is a fierce competition which principally hinges on script writers' imagination, I also invent the punchline for the production company: we can make anything look real on screen, as long as there is a mind can reach it!",7,0,1,15 September 2011
Green Book," GREEN BOOK is categorically a massive-appealing, cracker-barrel, feel-good gas bestowed with two tours-de-force and burdened by a less luminous journeyman behind the wheel
","American goofball comedy purveyors, one half of the Farrelly brothers goes solo, Peter Farrelly's GREEN BOOK is this year's Oscar hopeful, and could, very possibly pull a DRIVING MISS DAISY win against more high-brow heavyweights, Alfonso Cuar√≥n's ROMA and Yorgos Lanthimos'' THE FAVOURITE, both lead 10 nominations.Story-wise, it is a pertinent reversal of Bruce Beresford's surprising Oscar champ (both are snubbed for nominations for its directors), inspired by the true events in the 60s, NYC bouncer, Frank 'Tony Lip' Vallelonga (Mortensen), an Italian family man, is hired by black pianist 'Doc' Don Shirley (Ali) as his chauffeur to accompany him an eight-week concert tour in the Deep South, during which, the pair has to inure deep-seated racism and commences a heartfelt bonding process that is riddled with laughter and compassion, all to flog the obvious ideology to death (and introducing the obsolete concept of what is a 'green book') with an unpopular white savior designation.That said, the film itself will hearteningly cruise any skeptical viewer to its finish line, and most of the credit goes to the two leaders, Mortensen, vanishingly disappears from his lean physique and balloons into a typical foodie with a daddy bod, whose tucking-in scenes are so achingly funny, and Farrelly surely splurges on them, with fried chicken being put into great use into elucidating Don's awkward position as a fish out of water among either white or black folks, for his skin color or erudite miens. Mortensen's physical transmogrification welds eloquently with Tony's philistine, rough-diamond characteristics that in spite of being a total clich√©, the whole package of Tony Lip resoundingly connects with audience, preponderantly because of Mortensen's brio and commitment.On the other hand, Mahershala Ali has an inherent advantage that lies in Doc's unique otherness, which visually, is pointed up by Farrelly's unsubtle arrangement (that collect gaze from black farmers working in the field just betrays Farrelly's lack of imagination and flourish as a director), but Ali, has become the undivided cynosure ever since Don's grand entrance, and gradually, stories of Don's background emerge and his distinct make-up rounds out through many unsavory encounters with local racists and convos with Tony (who unfortunately shifts more into an onlooker or fixer as their journey continues). Never distracted from being charismatic, Ali affectionately impersonates Don's contradicted feelings, his anal-retentive, prissy inclination and most of all, a beautifully rendered vulnerability, which makes his ambidexterity of piano woodshedding more like the icing on the cake. One might surmise Oscar voters are collectively rueing the day that they have given Ali his Oscar far too soon for MOONLIGHT (2016), yes Oscar No. 2 is his, albeit it is an unequivocal leading role.GREEN BOOK's script makes good with minutiae such as a (presumably stolen) jade stone, Tony's letters to his homebound wife Dolores (Cardellini, shoehorned in the ideal wife part), who is given the most gratifying line to utter when she finally meets Don in the end, and the well-mined twist of whether Tony brings a gun or not.Last but definitely not the least, the movie doesn't shy from implicating Don's closeted identity (at the risk of offending Don's real-life family, though), a telling sign that homosexuality has finally earned a tiny toehold in mainstream production that no longer needs a full feature fixated on it for special treatment, just put it there, as it is in life.Although congenitally mired in the backlash of its inception from Tony's heirs, co-producer-cum-co-writer Nick Vallelonga is Tony's son, but as a film per se, GREEN BOOK is categorically a massive-appealing, cracker-barrel, feel-good gas bestowed with two tours-de-force and slightly burdened by a less luminous journeyman behind the wheel.",8,2,3,22 January 2019
Annihilation," an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template
","The follow-up to his enterprising AI thriller EX MACHINA (2014), novelist-come-filmmaker Alex Garland's second feature arrives sequentially in cinema first, then to the Netflix platform, a unique distribution exigency borne out of the ongoing profit re-shuffling feeding frenzy between old guards and future norm, boisterously in the name of the art of cinema. ANNIHILATION, an adaptation from the first novel of Jeff VanderMeer's awards-reaping SOUTHERN REACH trilogy, structures its narrative in the time-honored trope of an (all-women) expedition team entering a terra incognita shrouded by extraterrestrial might (aka. The Shimmer, a slowly expanding electromagnetic field hitting our planet like a bolt out of blue), coming in for both extrinsic and internecine perils, until the last remaining human contending with the cosmic unknown and metaphysical transformation against all odds, and is furnished with an open-ended coda to mine the seed for a possible sequel (that uroboros tattoo is repeatedly flagged up to elicit piquant fan theories). But conceptually, ANNIHILATION upholds an invigorating idea of random DNA synapsis in its core, catalyzed by the improbable phenomenon of prismatic refraction, and substantially surmises a possibility that the highly intelligent alien life form could be also flexibly amorphous, and it messes up all DNAs within its territory, knocking out animal/plant hybrids through haphazard genetic splicing and mutation, all the way to a physical replication of our doughty heroine, the biologist Lena (Portman, a relentless standard-bearer of true grits), which seemly consummates its nefarious mission of infiltration with a scorched-earth annihilation appearing more baffling than its scientific info-dump in the words from the physicist Josie Radek (a scare-easy Tessa Thompson), prior to her philosophical acceptance of her own botanical transmogrification.As a Sci-Fi food-for-thought, the film wisely refrains from over-applying cheap jump-scares and unsightly shocking images to spook audience, and its SFX team fairly dreams up an unworldly biome with breathtaking futuristic grandeur and presents varicolored, cannibalized flora-and-fauna bricolage to handsome effect, albeit one might cavil that occasionally its hue feels solarized. Heralded by the psychologist Dr. Ventress (a peerlessly detached, unforthcoming Jennifer Jason Leigh), the forlorn-hope also including Anya Thorensen (Rodriguez, fraught with agonized paranoid in a fanatical about-face), a gay paramedic and the geomorphologist Cass Sheppard (Novotny), is composed with a quintet of damaged goods, each is scarred by the disenchantment of their respective lives, which points up a meta-reference of human's self-destructive frailty, that resounds with a tint of hard-earned poignance. Rounding out its female-fronted cast is a terrifically enigmatic Oscar Isaac as Kane, Lena's soldier husband, whose mystical return from the Shimmer after a nearly one-year-long disappearance is the stimulant of Lena's own involvement. On a whole, ANNIHILATION is a welcome expansion of our obsession with the mighty, unknown life force, an amalgam marries a sui-generis brainwave with a less ground-breaking template, moderately vamped up by a state-of-the-art mythical touch.",7,2,4,18 March 2018
Aladdin," Aladdin!
","Watched this Disney's optimal animation in its BluRay form, a stock-in-trade family crowd- pleaser which has been engineered with an impeccable technique and what's more impressive, it oozes an unceasing force of genuineness to edify both children and adults, no condescending doctrine nor feckless naivety, and Robin Williams' voice-performance as the Genie is a great bonus and plays a big part in the film's classic status among its genre. To enumerate Genie's potpourri of imitations alone could be cogent enough to showcase the finesse both for the animators and the voice cast, Robin Williams is deadly hilarious, the motormouthed omnipotent servant, massively steals the thunder from everyone else. But it is not a pejorative remark to other players, on the contrary, it has the most effervescent ensemble including a usually trite class-defying mutual attraction between a princess with a lower-status prince charming. Jafar and Iago pair is another hoot apart from Genie, laughters galore!The plot line entwines pretty much in Disney's safe pattern, a romantic encounter, an abrupt departure, a reunion under the pretense as a legitimate suitor, fighting the evil enemy and happy forever ending, while it really pushes Aladdin to the edge of the cliff since Jafar's invincibility seems to be unbreakable, and the eleventh hour turnover is nothing less than a satisfactory one. 2D animation surely has been largely outcast from the lucrative market, but one can never ascertain there will be a wave of coming back in some years ahead, like Black and White films, their unique aestheticism is the wellspring of their vitality, after watching ALADDIN, it perfectly suffices to originate great mojo of satisfaction for an adult first-time viewer, so the last rites seem to be unnecessary, but a niche market-planning should be conducted for the sake of the laborious craftsmanship. The film currently sits at No.2 at my top 10 film of 1992, and Williams earns him a fifth slot in the supporting actor race, the one and only voice-performance on my own Oscar list!",9,2,4,13 June 2013
Incredibles 2," there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity
","A 3D viewing of Pixar's 12th feature film, INCREDIBLES 2, an overdue sequel, 14 years after its 2004 blockbuster, a time even Bryan Singer's much maligned reboot SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) had yet to reach the silver screen, a very different picture from today's glut of superhero consumption.INCREDIBLES 2's biggest challenge, save for treating its gaping generational shift with kid gloves (viz, drawing on the nostalgia of Generation Y and recruiting new kids who might have no inkling of its predecessor), comes to that daunting question, as an art-form, what animation could excel if its live-action counterpart can also achieve a similar if more captivating visual effects? especially when the storyboard is strictly human-based, on a general afterthought, nothing in this film seems to strictly require this treatment (the most demanding parts might be Elastigirl and baby Jack-Jack's psionic powers), and the answer to that question does not look rosy. With Brad Bird returning to preside over the project after his live-action sorties in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL (2011) and TOMORROWLAND (2015), INCREDIBLES 2 grandly carries Pixar's torch in concocting a sagacious and innovative story-line out of the genre's default family-friendly tenet, here, we have an appreciable role-swapping borne out of USA's current climate's gender study, Elastigirl becomes the breadwinner while Mr. Incredible takes a back seat in attending to their kids, indeed it is the latter part that registers most fun and laughter, a stay-at-home dad's quagmire is brimful of hilarity and commiseration, tonally chimes in with its preceding short Domee Shi's BAO, depicting a typical empty nest phenomenon from a mother's angle, vamped up with an oriental touch.What becomes problematic is the well-worn trope of saving the world from some evil intrigue, a very American clich√É¬© Bird has no intention of steering away, although through the message from and the designation of its ostensible antagonist Screenslaver, the film manages to alert viewers of today's pandemic inertia and non-action that partly can be chalked up to a pernicious passivity hugely influenced by notion of waiting for a superhero, and an attention span deformed by our screen-gazing mentation, but that sounds too adult-minded, hence, its lucid cogitation about superpowers expectedly and frustratingly gives way to a conventional, business-as-usual denouement, which overall, renders the picture a few notches below Pixar's more esteemed titles.Back to my initial question, the impact of its sleek strings of action set pieces ineluctably pales in comparison with the ones from its more visceral live-action cousins, as there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity, and admittedly, speaking from a personal perspective, the allure of animation and one's own age have been in inverse proportion ever since one reaches adolescence, if only that could be the sole legit excuse for one's mild disappointment of this case.",7,2,3,2 July 2018
Spectre," SPECTRE is conventional in its core but glossy enough to appease the average taste
","After achieving an acme for the prestigious 007 franchise in SKYFALL (2012), both among critics and money-wise, SPECTRE is designed to take down a peg or two from the former (especially losing the best part of the cast, the indispensable dame Dench), but the producers don't flinch to lose the battle on the latter front, so a safer plan is to recruit Sam Mendes to dish up the same pattern of Bond's (Craig) globe-trotting escapades, with a villain in a higher rank.The opening gambit in Mexico City during Day of the Dead is a pleasant spirit boost with a runaway helicopter hanging over a mass crowd, which coincides with the ending to emphasise that helicopter is a convenient but very portentous vehicle for villains, next round, choosing a means of public transportation perhaps, the Tube instead. But sad to say, the ensuing happenings are less impressive, since Bond has to go rogue again, to track down the leader of the Spectre organisation, Franz Oberhauser (Waltz), who is the son of the man who took care of an orphaned Bond when he was young. From Rome, to Austria, to Tangier, then to the centre of the desert, where an intelligence facility is set up by Spectre, will be blasted as default. Then the final confrontation is back in London, the old MI6 building, running against the ticking time- bomb, Bond will prevail in the end.Plotwise, there is little to feel energised to talk about, the ever-so-effete trend of the evil master-brain, takes a drab downturn as Oberhauser, or under the name identity as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, looks and acts less threatening (what is the purpose of torturing Bond by thrusting needles into his brain? And even for Seydoux's Dr. Madeleine Swann, he seems to be a harmless chap to sit nearby), to concur with Bond, his rambling speech is completely ho-hum. While Bond girls, Seydoux and Bellucci both are stuck in the frustrating stereotype of sultry victims waiting to be rescued by Bond's overblown omnipotence, only this time, age doesn't matter, but one is just a casual fling and the other is (supposedly) a soul-mate. A 50-year-old Belluci and a 30-year-old Seydoux, who will Bond choose? It is a cinch to divine.Supporting cast is what we can assume in a standard Bond's film, the only exception is Whishaw's Q, who has been usually granted an opportunity to proceed a perilous field work and gives off a frisson of suspense which we cannot trace in Bond's death-defying vitality (and in this case, also for Bond girls). One wish to see Bond in real trouble (not his girls or friends, but him), not lethal but after the rehashed story being told again and again, audience is reaching a plateau where a need to see something more viscerally damaging to intimidate Bond, otherwise, the appeal ebbs quickly after a fourth time, maybe time for a new Bond is opportune now.'The license to kill is also the license not to kill', is the reason why espionage like 007 should exist (in the fictitious world though, in real life, hopefully no), and as the ending properly shows, SPECTRE is conventional in its core but glossy enough to appease the average taste, a safe bet to cash in on its opening weekend, but definitely not stylish or creative enough to sustain its longevity or reputation.",6,4,12,7 November 2015
Her," a nonentity meets a no-entity
","Spike Jonez's fourth director feature, after BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999, 9/10), ADAPTATION. (2002, 8/10), WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009, 5/10), is his first where himself is credited as both the director and the sole writer. HER is situated in L.A. in the near future (in fact some scenes are shot in Shanghai), Theodore (Phoenix), is a writer for the beautifulhandwrittenletters.com, a melancholic and lonely guy who has just undergone a breakup with his ex-wife Catherine (Mara). Out of despondency, he purchases a state-of-the-art Operation System with intellectual consciousness whose self-coined name is Samantha (voiced by a phenomenal Johansson), which henceforth embarks an authentic romance between those two, on a trajectory as any human does with another human. One challenging and titillating aspect is that the simulation of a sex act contributes as an imperative obstacle in the way, yet Jonez underscores a requisite scenario that virtual sex activity is virtually a widespread habit in the beginning when Theodore hooks up with his cyber sex- mate SexyKitten (an amusing voice-cameo by Wiig) with a vicarious thrust from the racy pregnant photos of a celebrity, which paves the way for the consequent sex experience between him and the entity-devoid Samantha; furthermore, when the idea of a surrogate lover pops up, it hits the home run to pinpoint the unmountable discrepancy between human and machine, a line which is successfully blurred by the advancement in technology and the fickle intricacy of a human mind. Unobtrusively, the film spearheads into another tricky area, for the computer-generated persona, monogamy is an impossible commitment, Samantha chooses her name by reading a book with all names in less than one second, artificial intelligence and human beings are not in the same grade when capacity is taking into account. So the impending ending seems predestined, however I would prefer a systematic upgrading which obliterates the data to an unexplained disappearance, but in a way it also shows that Jonez is a resolute romantic, brings enough hope in the final scenes. Joaquin Phoenix comes up with a 180 degree turn from his Oscar-nominated performance in THE MASTER (2012, 9/10), as an introvert yet sensitive guy, enveloped with a conceptually warm surrounding and a larger-than-life art production while his inside is abysmally lonesome, he bespeaks for anyone who is bogged down by a real relationship and emits unremitting warmth and authenticity with his downplayed closeness. Scarlett Johansson, what a vivid voice performance, husky yet enigmatically demonstrative to impersonate a soul's verisimilitude. Amy Adams, Phoenix's THE MASTER co-star, brings another trans-formative presence here, she is naturalistically bubbly and spontaneous notwithstanding, retreats to a more muted niche as the best friend one would ever hanker for, a confidant and possibly the ultimate match for a tender person like Theodore. HER is a well-crafted indie fare dares to tackle a topical issue with intrepid honesty and rational creativity, its road-to-Oscar expedition (4 nominations including BEST PICTURE and 1 win for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) has proved to be one of the wow factor in a fiercely competitive year and a career high point for the multi-talented Mr. Jonez.",8,0,1,18 May 2014
The Nice Guys," wackily retro and refreshingly nihilistic
","Shane Black's third feature film, after his tent-pole stint in IRON MAN 3 (2013), THE NICE GUYS returns to his home turf L.A. as in his palatable debut KISS KISS BANG BANG (2005). A retro-70s odd-pair comedy couples a stone-faced heavy Jackson Healy (Crowe, sizably ballooned in his physique, whether intentionally or otherwise) and a goofy private eye Holland March (Gosling), who are set to look for a runaway girl Amelia Kutner (Qualley), but soon discover several deaths happened to those who are connected to a porno movie made by Amelia, in defiance of her mother Judith (Basinger), a honcho in the United States Department of Justice.Black is conversant with the genre ropes, apportions much physical endeavor to Healy, socking low-lives, close-range combating with pro assassins, and leaves the brain work to an ostensibly lackadaisical March, a single father perennially tailed with a premature teenage daughter Holly (Rice), who feistily teams with the duo in their children-improper outings (including a licentious party thrown by an AV producer), and coolly transforms into a dauntless heroine in the process of solving this desultory mystery. Yes, the plot is half-heartedly baked, there is no need of audience to connect the dots, a timely cue always routinely pops up to keep the story rolling, no matter how far-fetched it seems (a cash- delivery mission is interleaved in a slapdash flurry without rounding off its suspicious corners), and an crucial character can be conveniently dispatched right after beans having been spilt, just because her mission is completed, or maybe because she is a gorgeous, idealistic fruitcake, doesn't deserve a happy break?However, what brings home to viewers is Black's deft execution of a roller-coaster ride (almost) without brakes, under a minutely reconstructed milieu and location faithful to the ethos. Black pranks routine action shticks with unexpected but absolutely droll twists, e.g. the duo's put-on- an-impassive-face retreat in an elevator when body count is mounting thanks to a then- disembodied hit-man Johnny Boy (Bomer, in a thankless uglified villain mold), peppered with wry Nixon jokes and wacky dream scenes; he also invigorates bravado with cracking gallows humor, for instance. when they are held at gunpoint by a vixen Tally (DaCosta), like father, like daughter, Holly can be madcap on some odd occasion.The Gosling-Crowe interplay stimulates pleasurable chemistry and rapport under Black's devil- may-care rein, especially Gosling, seems to have an inherent knack at comic timing, and the newcomer Angourie Rice, skillfully straddles both pockets of precociousness and greenness, altogether they form a unique two-dads-one-daughter triad (without a palpable gay context). For nostalgist, THE NICE GUYS also marks a L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997) reunion of Crowe and Basinger (who is another Botox victim borne out of the insecurity of aging) almost two decades later, Crowe can still lead a picture with his rotund but still agile figure, while Basinger can barely find a decent role to boost her waning career. The film doesn't fare well in the box office front, which might hinder the prospect of a sequel so to speak, maybe the 70s milieu is chiefly appealing for the reminiscent and cinephile, lesser to today's Millennials core audience, also justice doesn't fully prevail in the end, and an almost nihilistic overtone doesn't enhance its popularity either.",7,4,6,16 November 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Roaring for a paradigm-shifting action epic!
","At last, I get the chance to watch this much-hyped action-er in the local theatre, squeezed in a third-rate screen-room with a pretty small screen, this is what I can find for a current movie enters its third week run in Cairo, the hardware facilities are inferior, but we should all make the best of what we can acquire.This reboot of the cult brand of MAD MAX from the mastermind behind its original trilogy is a felicitous remedy to the generational fatigue of CGI-rampaged action tent-poles the world is overloaded with presently. After decades of immersion into animation filmmaking (paid off with an Oscar trophy for HAPPY FEET 2006 with his co-directors), George Miller's grandiose return to live-action feature, the first one after LORENZO'S OIL in 1992, detonates the genre film enthusiasts with its cutting-edge visual spectacles which counter- act the current trend with the majority of its staggering set pieces accomplished with blood- and-flesh stunt-men and authentic objects other than virtual fictionalisation aided by computers, more pleasingly, the film has already conducts a profitable box-office trajectory worldwide, albeit it bears a hefty budget of $150 millions. Strictly speaking, the entire picture is a long-drawn-out wheels-chaser, it starts with Furiosa (Theron), an imperator who betrays Immortan Joe (Byrne), the tyrant of a post- apocalyptic world in the vast desert, driving an oil-tank truck back to her homeland (e.g. the Green Place) with Joe's five young wives on board, and Max (Hardy) joins the chase passively as a captive from Joe's war boys. After a string of white-knuckle experiences en route, from foes to friends, Max, Furiosa and one of the war boy Nux (Hoult) successfully outrun Joe's relentless pursuit and reach the land of hope, but hope is a luxury in this world as humans are on the brink of extinction, it only weakens one's most primal instinct, to survive, under any circumstances, which Max abides by firmly. Together, they embark on a more perilous journey to fight back, to topple Joe's reign and take over the source of water, and officially initiates a new chapter for the remaining humanity. At long last, we have a female heroine can face-off with the main villain without sidelining to combat sidekicks, or being cast as a convenient love interest for our hero during the break, in this case, the film is exceedingly refreshing, Theron's Furiosa, is a brave warrior, not once her female identity is used as a defamation or tease for cheap laughters, in the battle, sex is purely irrelevant, we have a posse composed exclusively of women, mostly grannies, but they are no less combatant than the war boys here. Feminism is a word now has been unfortunately garbled by some very vicious intent, but come what may, I am absolutely in agreement with that this is a revelation and a tremendous progress of our society when we can treat woman as a veritable equal as man, more essentially in the mainstream media, for that reason only, George Miller and his team is worth a big ovation. Tom Hardy's Max, although upstaged by Furiosa most of the time, is the definitive example of masculinity we should rightfully extol, a man of action instead of vain words, doesn't go all flirty with women (especially, the hot super model kind) whenever he has the chance, it is also a homage to Hardy's other well-known character Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) when he is curbed with a metal mask. Nicholas Hoult, on the other hand, represents another virtues reside in a man, the good-natured innocence veiled with blind idolatry, and finds redemption in the audacious sacrifice. Apart from its gallant stunt team, the originality of its eye-opening visual parade is also superbly boosted by the unique dystopia aesthetics from the art production and Junkie XL's adrenalin-driven score, only if I could re-watch it on an IMAX screen, it would be a paramount experience to drench one's frustration of our stereotyped blockbusters with stocky character settings and mind-numbing earth demolitions, so, it means a resolved 'No' to SAN ANDREAS (2015), and this is a film truly earns its entitlement for a sequel, or a prequel, since we haven't know much about Max's background yet. Hardy has already signed on for the next chapters, now let us hope Theron can return too, and more blissfully, with an equal pay-check to prove that we are not living in a retrogressive civilisation.",8,1,11,6 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster
","Ten years has fleetingly passed since Mel Gibson's last directorial outing APOCALYPTO (2006), HACKSAW RIDGE is his fifth feature in the director chair, just debuted in Venice, out of competition. It is a WWII drama about the US war hero Desmond T. Doss (Garfield), who is, quoting the film's tagline, one of the greatest heroes in America History never fired a bullet, is it an undisguised retort to Clint Eastwood's trigger-happy American SNIPER (2014)?Desmond's persuasion of refusal to kill people is ingrained by his religious upbringing and cemented by one childhood incident when he accidentally injured his brother during a tussle. In peace time, it is a precept without any question for every citizen to follow suit, but, not during wartime when massive killing obviously becomes a default means pumped up by jingoism and triggered by human's violent nature.Instead of being a conscientious objector, Desmond volunteers to join the army as many young men of his time, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, even though his father Tom Doss (Weaving, strikingly upstages his co-stars with searing potency) is a WWI veteran and has been traumatized by his encounter with savagery ever since. and doesn't think Desmond's ideology can find a toehold in the army. But Desmond has his own plan, galvanized by his romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Palmer), he decides to enlist as a medic, to save lives instead of taking them, so that he doesn't need to relinquish his principle.As one can imagine, his singularity is regarded as an unthinkable defiance in the eyes of his peers and his senior officials in the boot camp, he is picked on, verbally abused, beaten up, even subjected to imprisonment, simply because he refuses to touch a rifle or any lethal weapon. Against all odds, Desmond sticks to his guns, but it is Tom who pulls the strings, to seek permission to allow his son entering the battlefield without a weapon, which singles him out as the most conflicting character in a film suffused with one-note display of military discipline and war heroes.The next thing is the real deal, the close-combat between USA and Japan on the Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Gibson doesn't refrain from bombarding his spectators with rousing spectacle where death and injuries escalating exponentially in both warring parties, bullets-flying, blood-spurting, limbs-flapping, hell couldn't be worse than that. After the failed attempt to take over the ridge, which costs US army grave casualties, Desmond, lucky enough to be alive-and-kicking at that point, receives an epiphany from God. He plunges himself into the combat zone again rather than retreating with his troop, taking advantage of the night time, under the eyelid of Japanese army, he begins to drag those injured soldiers one by one to the edge of the cliff and send them down to the ground in rappel, in one night, he heroically saves over 75 lives of his comrades (some Japanese too) and miraculously survives from enemy's scouting, which immediately revitalizes the dwindling esprit de corps, in the subsequent attack, they triumphantly conquers the ridge, Desmond is wounded by an explosion, but it is not lethal, later he is awarded the Medal of Honor.The movie sends his anti-war message lucidly with its no-holds-barred delineation of the visceral cruelty in the front-line and valiantly advocates Desmond's peace-loving philosophy which makes wonder in the face of extreme adversity. Andrew Garfield gives a commendable impression as the wide-eyed hero, gangly, unsophisticated, dogged in his belief, fearless when he is doing the right thing, the only gripe is that he seems to more like a poshly shoehorned exemplar of individual heroism, than a complex personage survived from the ordeal of war. Another gnawing fact is Mel Gibson's politically problematic treatment of the enemy side - cannon fodder plus emotionless killing machine, which fails to bestow this engaging war movie a discerning conscience, especially when a blatant white-flag hoax is intentionally orchestrated to underline the rival's duplicitous nature, it indeed boomerangs and undercuts the empathy of this hagiography. Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster, but if we want a pi√®ce de r√©sistance with enduring impact, in all likelihood, he might not be the one we can bank on.",7,22,49,14 September 2016
The Social Network," The Social Network: 9/10
","Definitely one of the best films of 2010 and currently is my No.3 of the year (slightly behind INCEPTION and THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but No.1 on my 2010 Top 10 director list). David Fincher's last film THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) is a major disappointment for me (though he has remained one of my favorite directors since 1999's FIGHT CLUB). I feel exulted to see he will finally get his overdue Oscar for BEST DIRECTOR next year!For me, at first I was rather pessimistic towards this project, the biographic story of Mark Zuckerberg is surely not Fincher's cup of tea (considering SE7VEN, FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC), without a dark premise, it could turn out to be another case like TCCOBB, bland and tasteless. Unexpectedly the opening scene between soon-to-be-dumped Mark and his still-present- girlfriend Erica is mesmerizing and the conversation is sagacious and witty (I did watch the scene twice), which immediately drew me into a status of devotion, especially under of foil of Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails)'s arresting music score. The acting is outstanding by a rather young cast, Jesse interprets a complicated role with his cool-headedness and subtlety, at the time being, he is my No. 1 in the leading actor race. However Andrew Garfield's performance is much more heartfelt for me (as I have seen BOY A, I am not surprised to witness how much potential he has under his charming appearance, plus he is the new Spider Man, I think he could beat Toby Maguire by a mile, as far as Oscar speaking). The unexpected novae are Rooney Mara and Armie Hammer, the former will soon appear in the US version of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (directed by Fincher as well) next year as the protagonist, she will be rocket-boosting like Noomi Rapace this year; the latter manifests himself to be a perfect candidate as the new superman. Shadowed by the others, Justin Timberlake is just okay, as least not too annoying (and sadly to find out he is aging too).Almost everything in the film is flawless, the cinematography, the editing, the tempo, the cast, I am really appreciated this film to create a meaningful bitter-taste of becoming rich and famous at a young age, its practical significance could benefit many audience. Anyway I feel placid to see this film sweep in the coming Oscar, bravo Fincher!",9,0,1,26 December 2010
The Great Gatsby," a solid film regardless of its source material
","Watched this topical Baz Luhrmann extravaganza in a plain 2D version, adapted from a world- famous classic, the daunting comparison is predestined, lucky me for being completely oblivious of the original novel and its earlier cinema adaption, so I feel privileged to take my pleasure from viewing this film without being nettled by any premeditated notions whatsoever, blessing the ignorance! Zero expectation does assuage the nitpicking impulse, this period film establishes its unparalleled visual spectacle which its additional charge of a 3D fee could be considerably goaded, it has been the first time I wish I could watched it with the unease gizmo since INCEPTION (2010, 9/10). The upbeat Hip-Hop infused party music and retro-induced melancholiac strains (now I can not get Lana Del Rey's YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL out of my mind) is another novelty rarely being presented in a period drama, Luhrmann again victoriously testifies himself is the maestro of contemporary cinema's flamboyance and garishness (without any pejorative overtone). The long-time-no-see former Spidey Tobey Maguire (who is still able to pass off as a twenty- some due to his perpetual baby-face) is the narrator of an ill-fated love story, and surprisingly he does occupy such a lengthy screen time, even outstays DiCaprio's Gatsby. He is the observer, the bystander and a useful buffer between Gatsby and Daisy, Luhrmann and his co-writer Craig Pearce intentionally sacrifice his personal life (no relationship entanglement at all) to intensify his unspeakable admiration towards Gatsby (a bromance in the period time?), he is the one who is captivated by Gatsby's beguiling friendship, his grandstanding lifestyle and the money to sustain all these grandiosity and opulence. Maguire is impeccable as a wide-eyed third wheel, a surviver who is destined to tell the tale. Then comes the problematic couple, Gatsby and Daisy, both being introduced under the heightened and pompous settings, Mulligan's Daisy is first seen by her slender legs swinging with curtains fluttering around, a spoiled flapper subordinated by male chauvinism (who sincerely hope her young daughter would be a fool since it is the perfect niche for a girl). Gatsby, whose front officially being spotlighted during the lavish party, with tender golden light lingers much longer than it should be, DiCaprio's over-familiar persona almost prompts me into laughter. Both thespians are impassioned with the best they can offer, their first meeting in the film is a marvelous romantic gambit, and Baz still gets it! I must be too optimistic to say DiCaprio may stand a chance to win over Oscar's attention this time, his red-faced yelling outburst during the conflict is his Oscar-bait, but makes me squirm a bit, since it is his stock antics. For Mulligan, her role has an innate defect for being the collateral culprit of the denouement, so the misogynous judgement aside, Mulligan is praiseworthy in balancing the morally equivocal personality with her dainty style. My only cast gripe is the usually-outstanding Edgerton, as Daisy's gentrified husband Tom, Edgerton is too vulgar in physique and looks like a nouveau-riche doesn't tally with the chic surroundings.A few technical glitches, the editing is a shade too fast in the first half, noticeably during the happy-moment sequence of the reunion, the glitz does hurt my eyes. Then near the end, the caption-floating of Fitzgerald's text is a lame maneuver, we all know there are too many to tell in the book, however poetic it is, a more subtle approach is recommended. It is an over-romanticized saga, the final telephone call good-heartedly bookends it, even facing the demise, at least a tinge of warmth manages to run through our senses, one may call it over sentimental, others may refer it as poetic license, all in all, I think it is worth your ticket, and I cannot believe I would say that, even in the despised 3D form.",8,13,23,18 May 2013
Alien: Covenant," ALIEN: COVENANT takes a leap forward from its nearest predecessor, but it is a baby step
","It is fairly reasonable for audience to expect something less derivative from a beloved Sci-Fi franchise rolling out its sixth enterprise, but dejectedly, ALIEN: COVENANT doesn't cut the mustard because the newly assembled human cast will by rote tread the same sorry path of their ill-fated predecessors at the behest of similarly unsound decisions, a foreshadowed payoff where foot soldiers are expected to come in for grisly dispatches perpetrated by the slimy, fleet-footed and ferocious alien predators (whether it is a xenomorph, a neomorph or a facehugger), whereas the breathing beings (including those who are haloed with 'protagonist nimbus') will make the same mistake all over again (rule of thumb no. 1, stop rescuing those injured ones, they will never be cured, putting them out of their misery on the spot is the most merciful and sensible action), let the scourge imperils the next chapter. ALIEN: COVENANT is a sequel set in roughly a decade after what happens in PROMETHEUS (2012), many must rack their brains to recall any particulars happened in the less-than-satisfactory prequel, other than that the only survivors of Prometheus are Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and a severed head of android David (Fassbender). Here, the crew of Covenant, equipped with David's doppelg√§nger Walter, meets a monumental setback in the onset, their captain perishes in the malfunction of his cyro-sleep pod (a cameo from an exuberant James Franco), which instantly precipitates some lingering questions? Is there something iffy of the unlucky accident? Which the film refuses to elucidate. Under the helm of the new captain Chris Oram (Crudup), a man of faith and very disinclined to disabuse his opportunistic inclination that an untapped nearby planet might serve a better home for the ship's colonization mission when they receive a mysterious radio transmission promising human existence therein, the chipper landing party fetches up with a very Earth-like environment (they are even blithe enough to discard oxygen helmets before going out of their lander to breathe the air), but soon the invitation turns out to be a siren's call when body counts surge due to the infection of some vicious parasites (again, without the protection of helmets conveniently eases the process). The plot thickens when we are meet David again, this planet is actually where Prometheus eventually crash-landed, and David, living in solitude after the demise of Dr. Shaw, has conspired a sinister plan to supersede his mortality-bounded and despised creator and become a creator himself, a perpetual dread over the revolt of artificial intelligence takes the center stage where Mr. Fassbender can exercise his Manichean dueling with compelling gusto (a narcissistic android kiss lets on how lonely and desperate he wants a companion rivaled to his ambition, prowess, and immortality). Another real trouper here is Katherine Waterston's Janet 'Danny' Daniels, who is grief-stricken after the death of her hubby, the said perished captain, but never flinch in the action after his fellow crew members are being picked off one by one in the gore-fest, her mettle is an incandescent homage to the franchise's first heroine Ellen Ripley, still there is a nagging plot-hole when she seems to be unfazed by Walter's wound stitching (and even offers her assistance) after they escape from that plagued planet, as she supposedly should know that Walter has an advanced ability to heal himself (which is demonstrated earlier before the Walter Vs. David face-off), and this leaves the not-so-shocking twist in the end quite stilted because logically she should have known better than blurting out the 'cabin on the lake' question after being immobilized inside the pod.Fairly speaking, ALIEN: COVENANT takes a leap forward from its nearest predecessor in terms of its holistic coherence and ideological purview (a mankind's colonial expenditure almost scuppered by an android's creationist fanaticism, yet, it is human's inveterate caprice of risks answers the latter's invitation, to begin with, and the tale is nowhere near its finishing line), still, it is a baby step, reckoning its dwindling revenue, chances are this revered horror brand is in a creativity predicament, and with all due respect to Mr. Ridley Scott, it might be wiser to delegate his money spinner to a new helmer so as to drip-feed some fresh vision into its formulaic structure and outlook and Neill Blomkamp might not be a bad candidate.",7,2,8,7 August 2017
All the President's Men," All The President's Men
","As an outsider, I am not interested in the notorious Watergate scandal, as I truly believe that history is doomed to be forgot as long as time goes on eternally. The importance of what Nixon did was equally trivial compared with anyone else in the world (for example a journalist) in a long run. So generally political films were barely able to arouse my interest, but this one is an exception.I think the film cleverly put its center of gravity in the conducts of these two ordinary protagonists instead of a series of political figures. The fascinating part of this film lies in the process of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two young rookie journalists, how they cope with the immense pressure and internal fear to persist their work, which outshines its contemporary peers.Pitifully I am not familiar with director Alan's other work (I need to watch KLUTE and SOPHIE'S CHOICE desperately), but he manages nicely with the pace of the narrative and make the mundane procedures of journalists quite gripping. Surely a part of which should accredit to the DP(Gordon Willis), apart from the creepy scenes with Deep Throat in the parking lot at 2 a.m., several overlooking shots are fantastically matching with the cruel pettiness of each individual. The film won Best Supporting Actor for Jason Robards (a decent win) and a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Jane Alexander (a mesmerizing 8-minute performance) plus other winning and major nominations in the Oscar (as it was a box office hit at that year too), unfortunately didn't won Best Picture or Best Director. Interestingly this film boosts the image of journalism, which I do show more respect to after watching it, but strangely enough at the same time it also kills its charisma too, as before I do have a passion to switch to become a journalist, but now, I feel more reluctant because as a journalist, your written work always means less than the topic, I don't want to become a paparazzi regardless it is political or recreational. After all it is a well-done mainstream political thriller (owing a lot to Redford's endeavor as the producer, I am looking forward to his new film as a director this year, THE CONSPIRATOR, also a political thriller), it proves that Hollywood occasionally could export some good stuff besides huge quantities of instant garbages.http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",8,2,2,14 August 2010
The Wizard of Oz," The Wonder of Oz
","My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative. I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio- based product. It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye. The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz. Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill. Overall, it is a cartoonish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavor, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.",8,2,3,15 April 2013
The Martian," Scott is back from nadir
","A 3D-screening of the Sci-Fi picture of the year, after GRAVITY (2013), INTERSTELLAR (2014), the momentum of the hard science fiction sub-genre is going pretty strong, and for director Ridley Scott, whose career is badly in need of a revival, THE MARTIAN proves to be a timely global hit to his succour, a return to his most competent genre, and brings him out of his career nadir after THE COUNSELOR (2013) and EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS (2014).As its movie posters plainly assert, the film is about to bring Matt Damon's botanist Mark Watney back to earth after being left alone on Mars by his crew, since they presume he is dead during an unexpected storm during their mission. Based on Andy Weir's scientifically specific source novel and with the official support of NASA, the film adopts a more down-to-earth method to tell the story as realistic as possible, at least meets the basic criterion of today's scientific level.There are two parallel story lines at first, one is on Mars, concerning, the only man (might not be the only living creature thanks to the recent discovery of water) on a foreign planet, completely alone and how he strives to survive, fortunately he can avail himself of his professional know- how to successfully cultivate potatoes on the Mars' soil (which might not be realistic, then again, no one has ever been to the Mars, so everything can be ascribed to the imagination license) and produce water. Meanwhile, he is seeking a way to contact NASA, to let the earthlings know he is stranded, in hope of a rescue mission. And beyond our imagination, he manages to do that too, through the defunct Pathfinder, the roving probe launched on Mars in 1996. On earth, the narrative is centred on Teddy (Daniels), the Director of NASA, Vincent Kapoor (Ejiofor), the director of Mars mission, once they realise Matt's quandary, how they creatively sustain the communication with Mark and collect their wits to a rescue plan.But odds are not in favour of Mark, after a failing launch of a space probe aiming to resupply him for sustain until the next mission, and an airlock disaster destroys all his plants, a third party enters the picture, as the only hope is hinged on Hermes, the spacecraft on its way back from Mars to Earth with Matt's fellow astronauts, lead by captain Lewis (Chastain, a female captain!!), Hermes must extend its mission by another year in space, and firstly it must receive a booster proffered by CNSA (China National Space Administration) on the earth orbit, to resupply the Hermes, so they can return to Mars and get Mark back, and But if you expect some discord among its crew members, you will be disappointed, they are as united as ever, to risk their own life for the risky expedition. This is the final attempt, which unfortunately evolves into a public stunt not just for NASA, for America, but for the whole human race, to affirm that every one and single life counts, as in reality, we know it is not the truth.The film doesn't flaunt its visual grandeur, on the contrary, everything seems subdued for its accuracy, or at least verisimilitude, only the final rescue paragraph, propels us for an adrenalin drive like a less compelling re-take of Sandra Bullock's space yank-and-tossing with George Clooney in GRAVITY, but to an uplifting upshot.Matt Damon delivers a substantially absorbing one-man-show, generates optimism and gives wisecracks through a series of video logs, not an Oscar-bait performance but if he can get a filler nomination for INVICTUS (2009), it means nothing is impossible for him. Considering Mark's situation, facing his despair and loneliness in a lone planet, the most probable denouement is dying there alone, 220,000,000 km from home, his mental journey is short- changed nevertheless, since the film contends to be a satisfactory tale of a man-made wonder, it is understandable they try to whitewash the sombre facet of the ordeal. All the supporting roles are portrayed level-headedly through their professions other than 3-dimensional characters, a guilt-driven Chastain could have been a potential scene-stealer, but that never gonna happen and her crew is too harmonious to allow the captain to risk any emotional turbulence.Fairly speaking, THE MARTIAN is less visually-innovate than GRAVITY and less theoretically- sophisticated than INTERSTELLAR, but for a Ridley Scott's vehicle, it hearteningly reaffirms us that sitting at the age of 78, he is not ready for retirement yet. The film is extremely audience- friendly, roundly constructed, and most admirably, with no calculation to cater to audience's rapacious appetite of hollow special effects.",8,5,11,19 October 2015
The Fighter," The Fighter
","Finally I have time to watch this Oscar-winning film, twice in a row. It is a solid and caring theatrical work, a superbly contrived and deftly orchestrated sport-drama to be reckoned among its boxing sub-genre magnum opuses such as ROCKY (1976), RAGING BULL (1980), MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), and it belongs to this new decade. The pseudo-fly-on-the-wall boxing scenes in the film is remarkable both visually and mentally, even though boxing/sports films never fall into my radar range. Bloody yes, but on account of its biographic attribute, the zenith here is definitely not about boxing, the familial conflict is the remedy which we are longing for. Guiding us through this dramatic mental adventure is director David O. Russell's virtuoso prowess, whose filmography includes I HEART HUCKABEES (2004) and THREE KINGS (1999), both stars Mark Wahlberg. Russell's excellence could be easily detected through the dexterous shots, the terrific milieu setting and the intensifying tensions among his actors, also the retro soundtrack has an irresistible enthrallment on me. Anyhow, two Oscars for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo resolutely evince that it is an actors' film, but in the case of Christian and Melissa, their versatilities are no big surprises here for their trademarks as the drug-addict brother (stop torturing your body, Mr. Bale, that's enough, it's only a job!) that and the tough-as-nails yet solicitous mother. The bona fide revelation is Amy Adams, whose previous screen image had been pigeonholed as an innocuous and adorable sweetheart (as in JULIE & JULIA 2009, ENCHANTED 2007, as well as her other Oscar- nominated roles in DOUBT 2008 and JUNEBUG 2005), in THE FIGHTER, Amy demonstrates her resilient magnetism to impress everyone to incarnate herself as another true fighter, 3 Oscar nominations in 5 years, which is a quite astonishing achievement, so as to say, a late bloom never come too late, even for a career as ruthless as actress. Let's not forget our protagonist, the actor/producer Mark Wahlberg, who clearly embarks on a more profitable occupation as a producer meanwhile his acting in the film is by comparison sheerly overshadowed by his co- stars, although I cannot deny that he had been working hard for his role, and to play a blooming boxer at the age of 39 is courageous.So, it's ambivalent and useless to guess who is the real fighter in this film (maybe a rename to THE FIGHTERS are more soothing), in reality, we are all fighters to endure and survive in the mundane world (thanks god I don't have 7 sisters for the sake of the poor parenthood).",8,0,0,2 September 2011
Furious 7," R.I.P. for Paul Walker
","An Easter weekend cinema-going of this topical car-chasing no brainer, a franchise has already exceedingly overstayed its shelf-life, reaches an unforeseen acme catalysed by the tragic loss of its co-leading man Paul Walker last year (ironically in a car crash, again a bloody testimony of 'movies are deceitful', considering in this latest offering, no lack of crashes, but not even a minor concussion incurred or whatsoever.). After the series best FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) and a degenerative FAST AND FURIOUS 6 (2013, 6/10), this time, the director chair has been delegated to James Wan, the master-hand behind SAW & INSIDIOUS horror trademarks, it is a sure-thing its box office will explode and achieve another series-high, but reckoning a story and cast overhaul is inevitable for its next move, let us take it as a sincere eulogy not only to Paul but the franchise itself. The cast continues ballooning with Jason Statham as the indomitable villain, and Tony Jaa makes his Hollywood debut in a thankless role as a heavy, with a has-been action star Kurt Russell back in the game with the hope to hog the position as a regular for the upcoming adventures. Universal surely is hatching a bigger plan for their top-ranking monkey-maker mammoth. The movie never veers from binging on its WTF spectacles, this time, the highlights include a car-parachuting stunt, an action-packed hostage-rescuing set piece ending with a science-defying cliff-hanger, and a car-swooping among three adjacent high-rises in Abu Dhabi. No doubt they are all thrilling to watch, and the admiration for the teamwork behind swells up spontaneously, which inadvertently overkills in the final showdown with a bombarding drone running amok in the city, personally it descends to a headache-inducing and eardrum-hurting nuisance because it drags too long and the hand-to-hand combat between Statham and Diesel fails to match its promise. Now, to the mushy part, as a half-finished swan-song of Walker, Wan and the screenwriter Chris Morgan choose the safest route for his exit strategy, with the aide of body doubles, CGI effects and montages of previous scenes, to say the least, fanboys will feel satisfactory and the due respect has been properly paid to the gone-too-soon. After all, the over- sensational phenomenon is not because the picture per se is the best of the series, purely, it is another victory of the ever-correct marketing tactic exploits on people's sentimentality on tragedies, which in some way, actually could give this enervated franchise a glance of hope to regain its vigour and keeps its life span. But for now, I can only wish R.I.P. for Paul, never a versatile actor, but a down-to-earth presence our generation hopefully will not forget in no time.",6,36,85,5 April 2015
