The Lobster," A pitch-dark satire on the contemporary relationship game.
","If you've seen any of the previous films by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos – such as the disturbing Dogtooth (2009) – you'll have some idea what to expect from this, his English-language debut. The delicious offbeat humour and high-concept weirdness of The Lobster's first act don't conceal the film's darker intentions. The threat of some sudden act of violence is never far away.Watch out for familiar faces such as Ben Wishaw, John C Reilly, Ashley Jensen and Olivia Colman in the excellent supporting cast. And for a final scene which will leave you peering through your fingers in pure, disbelieving horror.Would make an excellent double-bill with 'Her'.Read more of my thoughts at filmblog.damaris.org/the-lobster",8,14,29,28 October 2015
The Martian," Matt Damon's stuck in space again
","Well, that was a lot of fun. You can't really fault The Martian on pure entertainment value, and its optimism is infectious. Personally I would have loved to see more development of the secondary characters, and even of Watney himself. I wanted to find out more about his background and his life back on Earth – but maybe the whole point is that we don't? This film gets extra kudos for its portrayal of women in science and engineering jobs. And for casting Sean Bean, entirely – or so I'd like to think – for the purpose of a delightful Lord of the Rings meta-joke.Read more of my thoughts at filmblog.damaris.org/the-martian",7,2,6,28 October 2015
