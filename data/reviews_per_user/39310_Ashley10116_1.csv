The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Low Ratings?
","I don't necessarily understand why this movie is getting such low reviews. I'm a big fan of the Twilight movies, and I believe this one to be the best yet. It does not deserve the 4.8 that it's getting on IMDb. I guess it's just the 'cool' thing to hate on Twilight, huh? People need to grow up. If you honestly saw it, and believe that it deserves a 1 or 2, please, feel free to rate it as that, but if you're a hater, and you're coming on here to rate it low just because you can, get yourself together and get a life. ---------------------------------------------- < I put those dashes because I had to have at least 10 lines in this review.",10,1,11,4 January 2012
