The Longest Yard," A very entertaining movie!
","I think that the critics were much too harsh in their assessment of this movie. Of course, it's not possible to do a re-make EXACTLY like the original. That would be boring, but this one had enough similarities and differences to make it enjoyable. It had its own personality, and I enjoyed it. The cameo appearances by Burt Reynolds and Ed Lauter were welcomed, and this movie made me appreciate how much I dislike Brian Bosworth as a football player, as an actor, and as a person. The Kansas Cty Star gave it only 1-1/2 stars out of 4. I would rate it three and a half of a possible 4 stars...no doubt about it. The only suggestion that I would make would be to go into more detail about how the inmates were to inflict physical pain upon the guards. It's also a shame that Eddie Albert couldn't make a cameo appearance, but he passed away last week at age 99.",9,0,2,1 June 2005
Cinderella Man," An 'almost-accurate' account of a real-life event
","This movie was truly inspirational and entertaining, HOWEVER, a few days after viewing it, I read not one, but two articles in The Kansas City Star, in which Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro Bodine of 'The Beverly Hillbillies' fame) criticized the director, Ron Howard, for portraying Max Baer, his father, to be a monster. In real life, Max Baer had nightmares about the boxer who died as a result of injuries sustained in one of his fights. He even gave up boxing for a time. When he returned to the ring, he lost four of his next six fights because he was so overcome with grief. What Mr. Howard didn't bring to light was the fact that Max Baer was so remorseful over his opponent's death that he paid for the college education of each of that fighter's sons. While Max Baer WAS a wise-cracking person, he took no joy in being responsible for the death of an opponent. I believe that that fact should have been brought out. Indeed! It was a stimulating, RAH-RAH movie, but Max Baer Jr. has a legitimate complaint. While I enjoyed the movie, seeing Jethro's comments in print dimmed the luster of a great performance by Russell Crowe. No disrespect to Russell, but I believe that Ron Howard could and should have been a bit more objective in his portrayal of Max Baer. That's why my rating dropped it from a 9 to an 8.",8,1,3,10 June 2005
