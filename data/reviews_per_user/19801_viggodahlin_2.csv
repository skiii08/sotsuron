Ford v Ferrari," Christian Bale surprises me every time.
","This Movie is fantastic, the performance of Christian Bale and Matt Damon is terrific and a very good movie overall. If you're looking for a fast speed car movie or a fast action movie like Transporter or Men In Black: International then this is not for you.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Pitt and DiCaprio Wow!
","Tarantino's New Masterpiece, this movie was truly breathtaking. This movie is 2h 40m on just 69' hollywood and it doesn't need any melodramatic drama to be enjoyable or any big story to be good which makes it a Colossal Success.",9,16,30,17 August 2019
