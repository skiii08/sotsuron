Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful Film
","As a lover of films and visuals I have to claim that Blade Runner 2049 is in my top 5 most beautiful movies ever list alongside Valerian (also 2017), Avatar, The Fifth Element and The Fellowship Of The Ring.I do understand the complaints about the length of this film and the illogical sequences, but the visuals would have justified spending time at a cinema in a tale that unravels (and ravels) new developments in the world of Blade Runner.Like many others I also became interested in the participating actresses. As a man a hard body certainly gets the juices flowing.With the film no longer in the cinemas I suggest a visit via a DVD, but I also suggest the director and producer refrain from further installments. I am not sure there is a story left there (that people want to watch).",Null,1,3,29 January 2018
Your Name.," One of the greatest human stories ever...
","From an anime nonetheless.Much has been said about this great animation and most of it is true.
It is beautiful, tender, modern (watch the film and you will understand) and makes human love interesting again.With that said, it is too bad that Hollywood has picked this up. Not that I will be watching that remake, but I cringe already at the thought of Hollywood hack and remake specialist giving this an American swirl. All the cliches of bad remaking and safe corporate changes will be applied. Aaaarrrggghh",Null,459,483,29 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Dumbest plot in a long, long time? No, There is no plot!
","This erratic and meaningless 'sequel' is an obvious and blatant attempt by remake/reboot experts Disney to bring a film to the screens and bolster revenue. Nothing more and nothing else.The director understands continuity and creativity like I understand lesbian love making.In a normal world critics would pan this mess, the audience would stay away and humanity would retain its dignity, but look at the world we live in... The Last Jedi is a money bilking scheme fit for the Trump era.",Null,4,7,29 January 2018
