Blade Runner 2049," Nothing we haven't seen already or watch Ex Machina once again
","I'm going to be brief.The movie was extremely dull and dragged on for far too long. Its runtime could have been cut by two and the message would remain the same.The script was nothing to write home about considering a much better movie Ex Machina (2014). The problem with Blade Runner 2049 is that replicants were basically ... yet another human race without anything that could distinguish them from human beings and that made everything too predictable and kinda pointless. They were a lot more stronger and a lot more difficult to kill - you can give them that.The two things that I actually liked about this movie were its sound track and visuals, but I've seen much better movies which had basically no sound and run of the mill visuals.",5,3,5,2 November 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Abomination of a film
","Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent acted faithfully, Brad Pitt looked and acted disgustingly. All those manners of him, I cannot imagine an Apache to behave like that.US soldiers looked like they won the war being its major force? WTF? The Russians were the only reason the world had survived and hadn't become a total Jew genocide.Was this film a joke, a comedy, a drama, or a parody? I didn't get that and I didn't like that. The end of the movie was absolutely terrible as it turned into a complete joke.This film is an abomination for spoiling the history and making a mockery out of people who truly fought to save the world. Let's see 'Saving Private Ryan' again.5/10 (just for Christoph Waltz and Mélanie Laurent performance for the first 90% of the film).",5,29,55,16 December 2009
Us," The worst movie I've seen in years (HEAVY SPOILERS)
","So,Aside from the fact that it's currently impossible to clone people and the fact that genes expression and various epegenetic factors may make your clone look very much unlike you, and the fact that they were raised underground without any natural light sources, so there's no way they would look exactly like us, and more importantly there's no way they could create absolutely similar offspring, since genes randomly mix, so even two pairs of twins will never be able to produce similarly looking children, still other questions remain:* Who and why raised literally hundreds of clones?
* Who financed this?
* Where is all the support infrastructure for their life?
* How come some of them could easily sneak on to the ground?
* What's this one 'soul' in two bodies BS?
* How come the clones knew where their counterparts lived?And dozens of other unanswered questions.This movie is logically and scientifically is one huge clusterfailure. I'm not sure why it was heralded as the best horror movie in years. It's the opposite of it.",1,3,7,1 June 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Meh
","Yesterday I finally watched the film and I was left hugely disappointed.Characters of the movie are barely developed, events are extremely compressed and none of them were given enough coverage, the director doesn't quite understand what deserves the viewer's attention: was it Freddie's bisexuality, his wild parties, his loneliness, his flamboyant character, his relationship with his father, his love for music, his vocal abilities, etc. etc. etc. There wasn't nearly enough drama despite his untimely demise. Nothing was given enough screen time unfortunately. The film turned out to be bland and flashy, with very little substance.Freddie Mercury deserves at the very least three full-featured films each 3,5 hours long. This film doesn't do him any justice.",3,7,11,24 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," An absolute drag for people who don't care about Hollywood backstage
","My review will be short: if you haven't watched the movies of the 60s and you don't really care about previous generation Hollywood stars and their fame issues, you should avoid this film as it's an absolute drag.I don't how the movie ended because I walked out of the movie theater. I just couldn't care less about anyone or anything happening on the screen.",1,8,20,13 August 2019
Gone Girl," One of the most overrated Fincher's films
","VERY MINOR SPOILERS BELOWThe first half of the film is pretty nice: it builds tension, mystery and manages to grab the viewer's attention. However the second half quickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier.What's worse, the second part becomes incredibly implausible, very tedious, and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely situations and reactions, you cannot help but wonder why people act like they act. For instance the police, who are very captious in the first half of the film, later believe everything they're told without doubting. Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and we are not given any reasonable explanation.To give the film due credit, it's impeccably played, it has, like many other Fincher's films, its very likable palette.Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos, at least its lead characters are. However the film doesn't give a chance to root for any of them due to their faults.",3,42,79,5 November 2014
22 Jump Street," This is not a film
","If I could give this movie zero or minus 10, I'd surely do that, unfortunately IMDb doesn't provide such a possibility.Well, if you abhorred the first movie, I can reassure that nothing has changed - we still have the same actors and largely the same script. Yeah, the writers were too lazy to rewrite the script or even add anything new to it.Even though this movie is sold as a comedy, the main ingredient is missing. There is no humor in it. Nothing at all. The movie theater I watched this movie in, comprised mainly very young people, yet during two excruciatingly boring hours the audience laughed just twice.People lately have been panning Hollywood that it's producing shallow stupid loud sexist movies catered to the stupid. Considering that these two movies have ratings hovering around 8, I have to fully support all Hollywood endeavors - people themselves have become totally stupid.",1,48,112,4 July 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A senseless mix of genres
","I've just left the movie theater so my impressions are as hot as possible. And I must confess that I have quite bad impressions even though I liked the first movie a lot.It has to be noticed that this film has become a medley of cinema genres containing comedy, drama, lyrics, love story but this heterogeneous mixture conceals a primary genre. I've got a feeling that this film creators tried to appeal to preferences of every audience, but in the end they just torn the movie apart. I was shocked by the awful quality of the plot - but it's better to say I was shocked by a big number of sheer plot holes. Even though in the first installment of the Transformers the plot was quite coherent, logical and consistent, in the second film you see an event and a moment later, that past event is completely forgotten as if it hasn't happened and has no consequences.BTW, about a genres medley. In the second movie the authors for no obvious reasons other than visual attraction borrowed plot findings of .. Terminator 3 and Jumper. Yes, these Transformers include a hyper-sexual woman out of Terminator 3 and space jumps out of Jumper. Alas, this teleportation wiped out the remains of reality.Oh, I've forgotten to mention that the Transformers 2 sneezed the plot of the first Martix movie, where Mr. Keanu Reeves resurrected after his own death (even though that death was semi-realistic and virtual). Alas, the creators of the second Transformers turned the movie into a pure fantasy - after Samuel Witwicky dies, he promptly reanimates having talked to some robotic Gods. BTW, you'll be presented with pre-historic times and pre-historic .. Transformers Gods.Proceeding with the topic of plot inconsistency and destroying the remains of reality, it has to be noticed that hostile robots having the advantage in a number and power, became kinda softies and couldn't defeat usual tanks and infantrymen with submachine guns (and a tiny group of friendly robots).This film still has the ultimate goof of the first movie - to be exact in different scenes the same robots have different sizes. Also, there's an awful modish element of almost all modern movies when rapidly changing scenes are shot (shown) using a shaky closely positioned camera.Having all its beauty and insanely expensive CGI (special effects), this film remained for me an insipid and senseless glitch.",4,24,51,21 June 2009
Annihilation," A mirror of humanity
","( Very mild spoilers below )This movie and its ratings show exactly who, on average, we are.There will be hundreds of reviews slandering the director and saying things like this movie is an incomprehensible mess let down by five brain-damaged female characters.However the main characters are exactly who we are as people: fallible, weak, scared, prone to errors, and prone to self-destruct although we fear death like nothing else in the universe. They are not heroes, they are just trying to do their work well, and they try to solve their own craziness in an extremely alien environment.Average people hate to think, average people hate self-introspection, average people couldn't care less about exploring hard science or pondering the meaning of life. Of course, the people who love Marvel or DC comics will be hugely disappointed since there is no crazy CGI, unkillable two-dimensional heroes, evil and good fighting against each other and lots of pop-corn.This movie shows us an extremely advanced and very-unlike-us alien life form how it should be.No, it should be understandable. No, it should neither be friendly or hostile. It should be different.This is a must see. If you loved Arrival, Moon, Interstellar and Ex Machina, you'll most likely love this movie.If you love loud super heroes movies, you may skip this one.",10,15,31,14 March 2018
