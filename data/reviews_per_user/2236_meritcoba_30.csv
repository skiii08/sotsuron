Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Henry and Kristl shed a light on Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)
","'So that was a cool version of Sherlock Holmes, a bit matrix like..,' Henry said. He was savoring a triple XXX in his lap from which he took small sips.'The slow moves certainly give me that impression,' Kristl said. She was drinking some tea that Henry made for her because she was of the coffee and boos. For the moment at least.'A regular action movie with lots of special effects and cool moments. As a movie it is cool how they let you see how Holmes can predict what is going to happen.''A far cry from Conan Doyle's hero though.''Maybe.. but those series were getting dull anyway and certainly needed some 21st century updating.''I am not sure I like the result.''I wouldn't have expected anything less from you,' Henry said wistfully.'You know me too well,' Kristl grinned.'Hey.. I just see movies as entertainment, you see them like.. like..ehh' Henry rubbed his forehead.'Art?''Yeah.. art. Make that Art.''It's a different viewpoint.I just can't help it and think that with all the eye candy effects and the whammy specials, the essence of Sherlock Holmes just evaporated. I mean, Holmes doing Kung Fu fighting? That is something new. And Holmes in a setting outside of Great Britain? That is new for me also. And having a prominent brother? I think there is one in the original books and I understand he is even more brilliant than Sherlock is. His main weakness being that he never leaves his house, which makes Sherlock more effective. But here he seems some important guy, although I do not know what his role exactly is.''That is the difference between you and me. I just take it as it comes..''That is why some people say it sucks and other people say it is great. I would not have minded if they had just done away with all the Sherlock Holmes characters and pasted something new on it. For the resemblance is tenuous at best.''But otherwise I think that the movie is entertaining. A lot of special effects, weird settings, gadgets and gunfights. And it never slows down.' 'That is true. Granted, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make the most of their characters, but that the story just goes all over the place and is so ridiculous that the movie turns out to be plain silly. The specials effect and the miraculous savings make the movie even more odd ball. It is just showy with no depth at all. It has nothing to offer but eye candy. I have not connection to any of the characters as there is just nothing to connect to. They are just empty shells.''A shallow movie?' Henry laughed.'Rambo has more depth than this. Even the league of extraordinary gentlemen has more depth.''That doesn't make it a bad movie, I would say.''No.. but it certainly does not make it last. It is a movie that has some impact now but it will quickly fade from memory, because there is nothing in it to make it memorable. To make it last.''Suits me fine. An evenings entertainment is all I need.''I am sorry to hear that.''It makes life more easy to live, baby,' Henry grinned.'What did you just call me?' 'Uhmm.''Just keep on uhmming..'www.meritcoba.com",Null,0,1,6 June 2014
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Henry and Kristl chat about Resident Evil: Afterlife
","'I like that plane sequence where Alice flies with her companion over a desolate zombie infested country side. I can imagine doing that. It feels safe but eerie at the same time. A bit like when in The Mist they are in the car driving through that mist. On the one hand you feel safe in that car, but on the other you know you are not,' Kristl said, 'And I like small propeller planes.''And Milla Jovovich looks great.,' Henry added.'Like Kate Beckinsale does in Underworld, huh? Ladies with guns that kick ass. At the start those Alice clones are even wearing some kind of suit that reminds me of Selene. Is that a reference to Underworld perhaps?''There is a lot of 'referencing' being done in this movie. That monster with the big axe walked right out of Silent Hill. And bad guy Wesker looks and behaves like Mr Smith from the Matrix. And the dogs and zombies with tentacles somehow remind me off The Thing.''I didn't quite understand where that big axe guy came from and why it attacked those people in that prison. Did someone send it? And why?' Kristl tapped her underlip with a finger.'I guess the Umbrella people sent them. Maybe to try them out or to chase those people out of the prison. ''I also don't quite understand why Umbrella keeps on experimenting. What for? There is nobody alive to kill anymore, except for a handful of survivors, who hardly pose a threat or have the will and means to buy whatever Umbrella makes. ''I think that there isn't much reason in the movie; just spiffy combat sequences. That is all that matters for this kind of movie. It needs to deliver some hectic fighting scenes with Milla in the middle whacking zombies and other creeps, and in the end she kills the head baddie in a spectacular way. Although in this movie he finally kills himself, which is actually funny, but the effect is a bit lost as it seems too far fetched to rely on him to escape in a plane containing the bomb he sets off himself. Spectacular, but unbelievable.'' The prison sequence reminds me of dawn of the dead, where they are cornered in a mall or the walking dead where they are isolated in a prison.The writer of the script was mostly borrowing from other movies. Seems like lazy writing. Lazy as when Alice and that other girl go somewhere with a third person, you know that third person is going to get killed.''And wham it happens,' Henry grins..'All the time! I wonder how long they can keep on making Resident Evil in this fashion. Dish up some action scenes with barely a story to stitch them together or have some kind of character development. An Umbrella stronghold gets blown to bits with every movie, even two at times, how many are there left?'' No worries, I think the next Resident Evil installment will play on Mars. Perhaps Alice even discovers they have been on Mars all the time.' Henry laughed, 'No doubt it will be referencing Aliens, Doom and Ghosts of Mars.''But you know what I think is the best reference of all?,' Kristl said.'Do tell!''That Hollywood sign they fly over and is shown as partly damaged and partly burning. It captures exactly what Hollywood is and delivers with Resident Evil: Afterlife: a smoking pile of junk that looks cool.''Amen to that.'",Null,2,6,16 May 2013
G.I. Jane," Henry and Kristl felt equal after seeing G.I.Jane
","'I am wrong.' Henry said.Henry and Kristl were sitting in their garage turned Cinema. The garage was a workshop with large windows and three sliding doors that was part of a petrol station. Henry and Kristl could rent it for an agreeable price, because the ground was polluted by oil and other fluids associated with cars that had spilled for decades onto the floor and fouled the soil underneath.'We could make it into a public restroom.' Henry had said. 'We were going to make it into a private cinema?' Kristl answered. 'We could make some money on the side to cover our expenses.' Henry said. 'And who is going to clean this restroom?' Kristl's gaze made Henry think of a snake about to strike. 'We could make it automatic, perhaps.'Henry sweat-ed a bit and felt like he had just discovered he was walking in a minefield. 'A Henry o'matic.' Kristl said with a flat voice.. 'Uhmm.' 'Just wrong. Plain wrong. ' Henry continued, 'That is why I never get any girl friends.''But I am your friend?' Kristl said. 'Yes, but I don't mean a friend friend, but a girl friend friend.' 'Ah.' 'A man like me would do something like this.' Henry produced out of nowhere a small white dish on which was placed a chocolate éclair with dark chocolate of such fine color that it made Kristl's mouth water. Next to it was a fine silver spoon, that shone green in the light of the exit sign. Kristl was staring transfixed at the chocolate éclair. 'You see.. I would have the notion that you give this to someone you like and that she, the she being you in this case, would like me for it. Just to be nice.' 'Who do you want to have killed for that?' Kristl smiled. 'I don't want anything for it, you just get it for free because you are my friend. Not a girl friend kinda friend, but a friend friend.' 'Gracias.' Kristl took hold of the dish with a slightly trembling hand. 'But I am silly really, because women want to be tough cookies that like to be trounced so you get respect from them and you get trounced by them so they respect you.. And then the greatest praise you can get from them is: 'suck my dick'' Kristl was eyeing her éclair in a way that clearly showed she had not yet made up her mind to swallow it whole or eat it in small bits. She decided on the latter. 'I am overjoyed that US finest troops are in reality dumb gung ho halfwits that are trained to a sharp killer edge by humiliation and torture. Guess that makes a good soldier.' 'suck my dick?' Henry said, 'What does that mean?' 'Well, she wants to be man really, so that guy can suck hers or his. I am getting a bit confused.' 'I was a bit embarrassed when that one guy walks up to her and stammers 'yu are okaj' to her like he was lurch from the Addams Family. I thought well, Seals, aren't they the finest of our men? Somehow Lurch doesn't quite fit in with that picture.' 'It actually makes me happy. Would be scary to think they were serious experienced intelligent men with a professional attitude. They could be effective and deadly..brr. ' Kristl said and continued, 'I was a bit annoyed when it was suggested it was bad that she might be a lesbian. Oh my god she is a lesbian! We have to put up with blacks, women, gays and now with lesbian So what does that say: you can be a woman in the army but not when you are a lesbian?' 'Imagine being a black lesbian' Henry laughed. 'But how do you feel about the whole movie?' 'I have to say it was an exceptionally run-of-the-mill movie. I didn't like any of the people in it. They were an amalgam of faces in dark surroundings. Then the movie used all the clichés. The politicians who can't be trusted and sell you out if it suits their fancy. The lone hero Jane who, having no experience whatsoever in politics, manipulates that woman, with decades of experience in politics. The cigar crunching commander with the I-don't-like-politics attitude. The drill sergeant who is tough on her but finally grudgingly starts to respect her. The boys who first look down on her and then become her buddies.' 'Yes, but I think that was all you could do with the story.' Henry nodded.'G. I. Jane has proved that us women can be beaten and humiliated as any other man in the army. And isn't this sad? How great is it that such fine intelligent people are wasting their lives on something so utterly needless as the act of waging war? There are people who can contribute something of value to the progress of humanity, but the only thing they learn is 'how to blow things up'. The movie is a hallmark of utter waste: now we women can be as useless as any men because we have equal access to all the branches of the army.' 'Hurrah for equality.' Henry said.'Any more of those éclairs?' Kristl smiled. 'A whole box of them.' Henry winked as he showed her the box, 'Come and get them.' After chasing Henry for five minutes He gave in and handed her the box. 'All for equality.' Henry said.'Jummy.' Said Kristl.",Null,0,5,7 August 2013
Unbreakable," Henry and Kristl discovered Unbreakable(2000)
","'There are basically two Bruces. One is the quick mouthed smart ass action hero from the Die Hard series and the other is this mature wised up guy that you see in Sin City, Pulp Fiction and this movie. Willis might be the victim of his own success by being typecast like that, but it works so well for him.' Henry said.'And with the superb acting Samuel Jackson, interesting plot and story twist this movie is a nice experience.' Kristl said, 'And, from my point of view, one of the few superhero movies I can bear to look at.''Oh come on, a lot of those movies are watchable. They usually try to add some depth to the characters involved and it is just entertaining to see over the top action being displayed on screen.. and nowadays even in 3D. Why do you want to see a movie about real life all the time when there is so much more that you can make movies about?''Hmph.' Krisl said.'This movie is a good take on the superhero concept although it lacks a bit in the action department and is tad slow overall for my taste.' Henry said.'And there are no girls in tight suits.' Kristl said, 'Only real women.''Very funny.' Henry said.'We should not forget the supporting cast, including the kid. They put in a good performance as well.''I agree.''Yet the big disappointment is at the very end. It feels like Hollywood stepped in and forced an uncalled for explanatory finish that derailed the whole movie. Without the end it would have been a much greater movie.' Kristl said.'Yes, it is a pity they did not leave it open ended. Like in a real superhero movie where you know the super villain will be back with a vengeance in the next episode.''So we agree it is a nice movie, which would have been greater but for the ending.''Yessa.'",Null,0,0,8 June 2013
Fury," The walking dead.
","Whenever a Tiger I tank and SS troops appear together in a movie you can bet the federal gold reserve on it that this movie is not about historical accuracy. This doesn't mean that Fury has no a sense of historicity, but world war II movies are actually never about world war II but about the spirit of the time they are made in. If you don't believe me, just (re)watch Kelly's Heroes and compare it to Saving Private Ryan. The spirit of Fury isn't a pretty one if we are to take our queues from the crew that operate her. During most of the movie they never display any redeeming quality; these are a truly sad crew. We have truly reached the bottom of the well as far as humanity goes. Even Apocalypse Now isn't as gloomy as this one. These are dark times were the best are the worst or the other way around. Well, not as bad as the enemy perhaps, who even hang their fellow country women for refusing to resist the invaders in a time that resistance is futile, but as bad as can be and only marginally so. The key scene is one where Brad Pitt together with Rookie invade a house where two German women hide out. It is one long protracted threat scene that screams rape with every frame. If you have seen Der Untergang, or have read the Last Battle by Cornelius Ryan, you will be aware of how these women would have felt. It isn't a pretty sight to behold. Fury has a scary anchor point, which is that it doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it because you have been told to do it and nothing else matters. It reminds me of a phrase of the game Mafia II: in the war the president pointed the finger at whom to kill, now it is the hand that pays me. This movie is thus about moral bankruptcy. In a human society there is no place for any of the crewman of Fury with an exception perhaps for the rookie who is the least tainted. Society can not work with the scumbags that war has created, and who have traded in their morals and compassion for the command: go forward and kill. They are the walking dead. It just needs a German bullet to remind them that they are.",Null,3,7,8 September 2015
World War Z," Henry and Kristl engaged in World War Z (2013)
","'Z means zombies, I suppose?,' Kristl remarked.'Sure,' Henry nodded.'So?''It is about Zombies,' Henry said in a matter of fact voice.'I can see as much..''Zombies for the masses,' Henry added, 'For people who do not like the icky bits. Like the walking dead.''Like me.. I am a regular squeamish person. Warfare okay.. but people gnawing other people... No.''So what do you think?' 'Think? Is that required in a movie like this?''Geez, Kristl...'Okay....I think that Brad Pitt is a good actor.''I agree.''I would have been honored to have Pitt for my spouse...''but...''If I was inclined that way...' 'But you are not.. so we skip to the sensible part, which means:it was a cool movie, but hampered.''Take it away,' Kristl said.'Oh.. well I liked Brad Pitt. He carries the movie without a doubt, but the movie has buckled under the inept story. I mean each and every scene is cool to look at and in itself a good scene, but it is as if they had like way too much story on their hands, so instead of boiling it down to manageable proportions they overreached themselves.''Seems so.''Still the zombies are cool.. when they swarm you and scream and change,' Henry said.'Yeah.''This is the problem. Each setting is but briefly used, no character development or story arc has time to develop before they fly off to the next scene. So we start in the US, go to a fleet, then fly to Korea, then to Israel, then we are in a Russian airplane flying to Wales and finally we are in Wales. Each setting is a whole scene with characters and a background and we skip the scene before we get 'settled in',' Henry said.'.. which would not have been too bad if they had Brad accompanied by a group of people. Like they do after Israel with Segen. But they should have tried and stick to a limited group of characters, maybe one for each scene he picks up so we can get involved with them, care for them and are shocked when they are killed or whatever,' Henry continued.'Now Brad has to do that all on his own,' Kristl said.'Yeah, if they had done that I think that all the other problems would have been less of a problem.''Lol, like Segen picking up a two handed weapon while she misses a hand,' Kristl laughed.'Or building a wall against zombies because you have information on their existence, but forgetting they react to sound and then have a group of people sing just behind the wall, so the zombies get attracted and assault it.''Did you ever get that idea of the tenth man in Israel?''Yeah, I understand the concept, but they never quite explained how he convinced them and, what is more, why did they not warn their allies? I mean they made a wall. It is not something you just put up in a week. Israel building a wall would not go unnoticed even if it took them a week,' Henry said.'I think that was implied,' Kristl laughed.'The movie has many nice settings and a good cast, but the story seems to have collapsed under it's own weight and for sure the script writers are to blame for the shortcomings.. I read that originally the movie was different with a final battle in Russia. Which stands to reason as the plane that takes them from Israel is Russian.''So an okay movie, but with many shortcomings. But saved by Brad Pitt.''We could call it maybe World War B?''Sounds good to me.''Even if you are not inclined that way.''Oh God, I will get that thrown in my face from now on. I know it will.''Kristl likes Brad,' Henry grinned.Kristl tried to boot Henry, but he saw it coming.www.meritcoba.com",Null,0,2,22 March 2014
Public Enemies," Henry and Kristl discovered Public Enemies(2009)
","'It is hard to say no to a movie with Johnny Depp in it, isn't it?,' Kristl said, 'I have to see it, regardless.''And Public Enemies, a title that catches the attention and Michael Mann as director. The man of stylish movies: slick, downplayed violence and blurred borders of morality,' Henry said. He folded his hands behind his head while leaning backwards in the front row seats of their garage turned movie theater. He inspected his surroundings. It was a place He was continuously working on. He had found and bought the seats and installed them each and every one. Perhaps he had been a bit too enthusiastic, for there were far more seats than they ever would need. But it was the mood that counted. The experience of a 'real' theater, but at home.Maybe we ought to open the place once in a while for the public or invite guests? I could even ask a little bit of money, just to cover the expenses. Henry twiddle as hairs on his chin, the hairs were part of his short beard, that covered only his chin, and started planning. The beard had made Kristl burst out in spontaneous laughter. He had just smirked back at her. He was on the ball with current trends and styles - he had just bought a Nexus with 32 Gb- while Kristl was stuck in a past so impossibly backward that they had not even known mobile phones, let alone handhelds. How did they survive! Kristl had proudly announced that she still used her Samsung X620. Which she had shown to him to proof she wasn't making things up. Henry had gasped. Like that was from 2005 or something. With her communism, her pink eighties look and old mobile, Kristl was already a relic of a bygone age. 'Kristl, we're living in the 21st century now.. when are you going to catch up?' Henry had exclaimed.'I like collateral. I think it's one of his best movies. With Tom Cruise as that sharp dressed killer. I like that movie,' Kristl said, 'A role that fits him like a hand does a glove.''I missed that a bit in this movie. That Mann thing. As if he isn't able to play work that out in a movie that is not set in the here and now, like most of his movies. ''It still has these touches. Like it is hard to see what the difference is between the cops and the robbers in methods and, well, collateral damage,' Kristl said.'There is a lot of shooting. Mann likes those choppers. Tatatatatatata.''And violence in general. There is even a woman being beaten up. You don't see that much in movies.' 'It was an entertaining movie, with a lot of violence, a small romantic side story, but little else.''The strange thing is that the whole story is mostly made up. It's not the real story of John Dillinger.''And that is strange?''No, it is not strange to divert from history, but usually it is because the 'real' story needs to be turned into a movie, sometimes because it wasn't that interesting or the 'real' story just doesn't fit well into a movie. But the fact is that that the real Dillinger story seem interestingly enough, so why make up your own story? For instance the role of his family is downplayed by this movie, to the point of not being important at all. And the movie suggest he an one important love interest, while he seems to have many loves. Again the question pops up: At what point becomes the 'real' story so distorted that calling it Dillinger seems pointless. I mean, why not make it: a movie based on a true story, instead of suggesting it is the true story?''Perhaps because that sells better?' Henry laughed.'No doubt. It is the bottom line isn't it?''The real test would be the portrayal of the characters involved. Dillinger and his adversary Purvis. Or his love interest Betty. I felt I never got a grasp on them. You never quite got an idea of what they were about.''Like in collateral? I mean with only two characters Mann had time to develop them, and given that Fox and Cruise, even Cruise, can act well, the story works. For me.' Kristl said.'Despite Johnny Depp? If you look at Dillinger in the documentaries you see that he is a good looking man who has kind of charm. A catchy smile. Depp plays him as brooding dark figure. No fun at all. It is a pity he did. And the actor playing Purvis, Dillingers adversary, doesn't make much of that character either.''It's a nice movie, the kind you look at to be entertain and then forget, it is not one of Mann's best and has nothing much to add. No doubt there will be a new Dillinger movie as this movie isn't actually a Dillinger movie.''Maybe they remake that other movie and call that one Dillinger.. the one with Clark Cable,' Henry mused.'You mean Manhattan Melodrama?''Now how do you know that?''Looked it up. Maybe we should have a look at that one, some day.''You mean.. a black and white movie from way back?' Henry said.'Yes?''No way..Let's wait for a remake.''If there will be any.''Then we look at something else.''Pity, guess that will rule out the Third Man as well,' Kristl said.'Well, I make an exception on occasion.

I guess.''Figured an commie like you would name Modern Times.' Henry smiled.'Eh?''You mentioned Modern Times. A commie would like it. The movie is just an attack on capitalism.''Uhm. Commie? Well.. let's talk about that in due time.''On with Hitler.. eh The Great Dictator.' Henry said.'I bet he couldn't laugh about it, but I wonder.. would Mussolini have laughed about it?''I bet not. I bet that people who are dictators can't laugh about themselves, if they could they wouldn't be dictators.' Henry said.'Wow.. that is an observation of life.'' I can observe life as well as anyone else can.''I bet.''So a masterpiece?''Yes and no.' 'Yes and no?''Well it's a masterpiece in the way it is made and what it is about and the statement Chaplin makes. That makes it an unique movie.''But it is also a long slapstick movie, which has it's moments at times, like when Hinkel and Napaloni meet, but still feels like a bit old fashioned even in the 1940. Like those chase scenes when the Schulz troopers are after him.''Schulz.' Kristl laughed.'What?''It is a funny name as it means guilt in German. It is an apt name because Schulz saves the Jewish barber because he owes him for saving his life, but later on he feel guilt because he has supported Hynkel. I wonder if Chaplin was deliberate in that.''Might be.' Henry said, 'I found most of the story somewhat dull and sometimes strange. Like when nobody sees the similarity between Hynkel and the Jewish barber. Also it has a nice feel about it. Like those Nazi were not nice people, but the it is probably meant as a slapstick. So it had to be nice.'Kristl nodded, 'The story has it's odd twist and turns. Like that Hynkel and the Jewish barber switch roles. It is as if he mixed two kind of movies. A serious movie and a slapstick movie.''It might be.. I found it a bit long in the tooth.' Henry yawned.'Still it remains a masterpiece.''Ah''It is a tribute to the belief that we are all humans, each and everyone of us, and that we could live in peace. The end speech is often felt as an awkward long statement.. but it is here that you feel Chaplin shoving aside the movie and directly addresses the viewer. It was of course not done and it must have felt embarrassing by many to be directly talked to. As a method of movie making it was seldom seen in a normal movie. It clearly brought out the idea that you can invoke a strong emotion by directly talking into the camera and the audience.''And that makes it a masterpiece?''That and his direct appeal to humanity.'",Null,1,3,19 August 2013
A Bridge Too Far," Death in color..
","When the allies dropped four airborne units(one a Polish brigade) into Holland near the end of 1944, only to have one of them defeated by unexpected resistance from German units and cheering crowds of Dutch, nobody took in account that they would make a movie about it some decades later. Perhaps if they had known, then their decisions would have been different, not that war gets to be more or less tolerable either way. Cornelius Ryan provided the source material for the movie and if you want to try your hand on a book that holds the middle ground between a historical narrative and something readable 'A bridge too far' is certainly recommended. Ryan wrote several more books about the war, the Longest Day being also made into a movie some years prior to this one, but the one about Berlin never got made. Perhaps times had changed or that book was too much about German women raped by dudes from Siberia, I can't tell. We have Der Untergang as a substitute nowadays.Mentioning the Longest Day reminds me of a question that has plagued me for a while now, which is: how and why did Sean Connery get to be promoted from Corporal in the infantry to Major-General of an airborne unit? This minor question is at the heart of the movie and it never gets explained. You might think I am pulling your leg, but after having seen this movie just now, this question actually is just a subquestion of the bigger one which goes: where are the people in this movie? The movie plays out like a documentary filled with a fair share of Monthy Python stereo types, but without the intended silliness, and otherwise bland Americans. But maybe I am mistaken about intentions? The movie seems more like a race about who makes the least dumb mistakes and the Germans won, but only by a margin. Or perhaps we can say the Poles and Americans would have won, had they not been on the same team as the British. This movie is noticeable different from that other Ryan movie where mistakes where made, but John Wayne was there to safe the day. Here no amount of upper lip stiffness, jolly ho hum and cigar gnawing can turn the impending defeat in anything else but one. And the funny bit: the Germans do not even have to lift a finger, just talk among the high brass a bit.For war is the business of high ranking officers who get mentioned in books and movies, the rest fulfill their duties by killing or getting killed.While the star studded cast executes their moves, the only people who remotely resemble people are the Dutch, but again, only by a margin. The most silly is possibly James Fox who gets this amazing scene in which he drives past the troops under his command Jolly greeting those who are about to die. Dickie old boy, how is the leg? Still twitching, sir. Brave lad! Next scene sees Dickie's tank being brewed by a German 75 mm Pak, despite 25 pounders bombarding their position. Which makes one wonder why them Germans are only bombarded by airplanes after they shot to pieces the advance squad or why the English didn't use something heavier. But I am no general.Some scenes later it is the Brits turn again to do something dumb by executing a frontal attack on a pillbox under the cover of broad daylight. Let's try that at night next time Hannibal Lector says. That is called learning on the job, for you. Pity it took some dead soldiers to learn that lesson, but I am sure he is used to dead bodies. The Germans some scenes later outdo the Brits by sending an armored recon unit across the enemy held side of the bridge which results in amazing carnage that has inspired painters. There is nothing so gripping as burning wrecks and dead bodies to inspire artists. By this time one wonders what kind of movie this is supposed to be? If someone said it is an anti- war movie, than I might believe them forthwith. But we will never find out I suppose and the only thing one can say is that compared to that earlier Ryan movie it has far less people in it, but then, this one is in color, so who is complaining?",5,2,9,5 June 2016
Gettysburg," Henry and Kristl barely survived Gettysburg
","'Oh my god..' Kristl was holding her head between her hands.'Did you know there is an extended version.' Henry gave her a rueful look.. It is only seventeen minutes longer. So well, if you plan to sit through the whole movie, you might as well add the extra eight percent of the extended version. Just for kicks.'Oh my god.' Krist repeated as if in trance.'Must have been really cool to be one of those guys in uniform. One with the guys. Playing at soldier; the biggest danger being to get a sunburn. That is what it basically is: a reenactment movie with established actors filling in the important roles. And one has to mention Jeff Daniels; he was great..''Oh my god.''I can imagine those reenactors sitting together in a shack to display this movie: their movie. Son, that is us marching there and that is Wily Bee. And there is Sam Navarra, you know he runs the grocery store down the road.. And in the background just between the legs of Lee's horse you see Luke 'the Doc' Mcpharil tending the wounded. And that there is...' Henry smiled, 'You see that picture?''Oh my...''You can stop now.' Henry grabbed Kristls arm, 'You made your point.''It is so boring.They should make two movies: one for the civil war buffs and another for the rest of the world. That last one should be the first but cut by half and arranged around Jeff Daniels. And perhaps throw in some maps so we have an idea where he is.' Kristl said.'Hmm''There is almost no dialogue; mostly speeches. The kind where they stare into the distance as if it is the future and they say something like: this battle will be remembered by future generations because they will know we stood here with proud hearts... etc.''They did it all the time and that is why most battles were such muddled affairs.' Henry said'Commander.. what are your orders?' Henry mimicked a voice with southern accent..'Sorry soldier, got to ride to yonder hill to make a speech meant for destiny! And away was Lee, leaving the tactics of the battle in the hands of whomever was willing to supply the asker with orders.' Henry said.'Oh my...''I tell you the most important lesson of this movie though. Which can only truly be evaluated when watching another movie which is called Civil War reenactment documentary. About everyone interviewed must have been about thirty pounds heavier than their civil war counterparts. Which is probably why you never see them much up close. If they could learn anything of this is that the civil war soldier was more likely to die from a bullet than from obesity, while now it is probably the other way around. 'Kristl shrugged, 'I can not understand why people want to reenact warfare. Especially when it gets pervaded with an air of snobbery like: we are doing something worthwhile here, while you are doing not. If you want delve into history as part your identity crisis there are so many peaceful ways.''Ah peaceful. Nobody makes a movie about non-violent stuff, because nobody wants to watch it. This is guys playing with guns and someone once said: never get between a man and his gun..''Oh my god. I bet it was John Wayne.''You're a man or you're are not.' Henry grinned.'Wait a moment' Kristl grabbed her mobile and started to press the keys.'What are you doing?''I get you a few pizzas. With about thirty pounds extra on that frame of yours, you might blend in with the reenactment community. Then put on any old rags you can find and pass yourself off as a confederate soldier. You play with guns and act all snobbery because you have something of historical value to pass on, while all the while you are nothing better than other people playing video games, drawing pictures, doing origami, climbing mountains or watching horror movies. Cause the only thing a war learns is that it is a horrible affair that should be avoided because it kills people.''Uhm. You are quite vehement.' Henry was taken aback .'Yes. And I will tell you why. I happen to have been so stupid to spend most of life on the study of warfare. Now you think 620.000 people is much. Compare that to the Taiping Rebellion at roughly the same time. It killed at least fifty times as many people and might even have killed a hundred times more. And this was no warfare in which women and children were spared. No, everyone was killed: cities destroyed and countries wasted. It was total war. And I doubt you will find anyone willing to reenact that. Now if some fat civil war reenactor wants to learn something from his past, he might at least learn to eat less and exercise more, because that war is a horrible thing is apparently lost on him.' And, overcome with emotion, Kristl stormed out.Henry listened to the door shutting and thought that letting Kristl cool down was the wisest thing to do. He then went to the kitchen and brewed some home made coffee according to a trusted and tried recipe that his family had handed down the generations and he knew it was something from his American past that Kristl really liked.",Null,0,2,17 July 2013
Underworld Awakening," Henry and Greta talk about Underworld: awakening
","'You know I hesitate to say it, but Kate Beckinsale is a really cool chick. I mean I wished she jumped right into my bed, even with those heavy boots and that figure hugging suit. Lucky she found them back after she was blown to smithereens and revived in that laboratory. Although she would have been naked without them. Oh god I could device so ways to relieve them of her.' Henry grinned. He twirled the DVD of the movie in his left hand.'I thought we were going to keep this pg rated?' Greta quipped. She knocked the DVD out of his hand and send it flying.'She just looks jummy in that suit, even after all these years.. I wished I could have.... Awww.' Henry groaned loudly because Greta had just booted him in the shin.'You like them boots?' Greta grinned evilly, pointing at her worn combat boots. The kind that were cool in the eighties.'Gosh, that hurts.' Henry rubbed his leg.'Pity they left out that cute guy.. what was his name?''Scott Speedman?' 'Yes. That one vampire guy hasn't much of role. Nor that black police dude. And that kid. I really don't like kids in action movies. This one can't quite decide to be a hostage or some kind of remake from a Japanese horror movie. If you have to have kids in a movie, make them quiet and don't turn them into monsters!' 'With the kid there would be no reason for Kate to go and shoot up everyone. And how she kills. Like she jumps and somersaults all over the place. And some moments are really cool. Like that elevator scene where she blasts a hole in the bottom of the elevator so as not to be swatted by it when it rushes down. That one is priceless. Look how sexy she looks in that scene.' 'I wished Stephen Rea had a better part in it. I liked him in V for Vendetta, but here he seems a bit lost. And him turning into a what? Was that a werewolf hit by baldness?' Greta mused.'He did look a bit out of place. But overall I think it's a fun movie with lot's of shooting and action, and Kate Beckinsale jumping around killing hordes of people and Lycans.' 'I think the werewolves - Lycans -are getting a bit threadbare. I wonder how long they keep on being interesting. ''Well, they did add that huge one. It was evil how he tossed those cars about and hunted Kate down. That part where he corners her in a booth is funny. Grawww.' Henry snarled loudly, making Greta jump.'It's not actually not Kate, but Selene.' Greta corrected, 'Kate Beckinsale is the name of the actress, Selene is the name of the part she plays.''I don't think it really matters. She might as well be Kate. Without her it would be a boring mindless slaughterfest.' 'You really like her that much, Henry?' 'I sure do. I am going to start a campaign with the express purpose to get Kate to do all the next underworld movies wearing a tight PVC suit and boots, but with a wider range of guns and weapons.' 'Did you say you were going to wear a tight PVC suit?! That I want to see!' 'Very funny, Greta.' 'I wouldn't be surprised if you get your wish fulfilled. Although the next director might be called Uwe Boll.' 'Uwe who?' 'Uwe Boll. I think he is considered the worst director currently alive.' 'Well.. it doesn't really matter who directs it as long as Kate is in it wearing a tight suit killing lots and lots of Lycans in various ways.' Henry shouted happily.'And to hell with the story and the directing..' Greta whispered.",6,2,3,29 April 2013
American Sniper," They are orcs..
","Just like Fury isn't a movie about World War II, American Sniper isn't about the Iraq wars. Nor is it about 9/11. And most certainly not about an American Sniper. This movie is about America.This is what a hero should look like according to yourself, Eastwood tells us.. Did you not decorate him? Did you not buy his biography in droves. Did you not read the book from cover to cover? Did you not gulp down the story of an all American blond haired, blue-eyed Caucasian guy with a pretty girl-next-door wife, who goes out to protect the greatest country on earth? A man of duty? A man of inner nobility? An all American hero?This is why it doesn't matter whether the movie is set in Iraq, the Outer Hebrides or Middle Earth. This is why it doesn't matter who the enemy is. And this is why it doesn't matter whether the movie contains a truth or not. The only thing that matters is the larger than life depiction of an unblemished hero.And Eastwood doesn't hold back and goes one step further. The American sniper invades, for it matters not. The American sniper shoots enemy soldiers, because they are not. The American sniper takes out women and kids, because they are not.Any unease that an American soldier might have shot a someone in violation of the Geneva-convention is taken away by clearly depicting the enemy for what they are: orcsAnd did you not notice how unlike reality this is? Is that what really happened, America? Was every civilian death such a clear case of the enemy using any means whatsoever and thus justifying a reaction in kind? Did you really wait for the civilians to show their hostile intent before gunning them down?Did the fog of war not exist in Iraq? Or did you flatten their houses and mow them down with machine guns before they could become a threat? All to protect the greatest country on earth?Perhaps it was Eastwood's intent, or perhaps not, but the movie is a mirror to what America is not. The more shinier the American sniper becomes the starker the contrast with reality this picture is.The American sniper is all what an American soldier should be like.. So unlike reality..",Null,0,9,9 September 2015
The Caine Mutiny," Henry and Kristl investigated The Caine mutiny
","'Humor me?' Kristl said.'A six pack of Bogey,' Henry's barked a laugh, 'Isn't that a bit too much of one thing?''I thought it might be educational. Bogart is still quite famous, so I was wondering what substance is there to the icon.''True, he is famous. Like Marilyn Monroe or.. Betty Boop.' 'Betty Boop?' Kristl arched an eyebrow.'Never mind about that.. So six old movies Why these?''It says that they are the great classics...but these are not all the movies that he is known for today. Well, except for the Cain mutiny. You know The African Queen, or the Maltese Falcon or Casablanca.''It might be boring,' Henry said.'It might be interesting.''Duh.. six movies. Six old movies. Six very old movies.. Black and white movies. The horror.''The horror? That is hardly an fitting. I mean, it can not be as bad as all these movies about cutting teens into tiny bits.''Hmmppf. Why do we not try one of those.. just to be fair?''Only if I can wear a helmet, a blindfold and have something like Rammstein playing over the headphones. Very loud.''You're sissy.''If that is what it is called, then that is what I am. And actually it is five now. We just saw the Caine Mutiny.''True.''Did you like it?''It was entertaining.. And that despite the lack of excitement..''You mean the lack of violence? It is not an action movie and not a romantic comedy either, but a drama movie. I got the feeling there are not that many around much, but maybe there were never that much around anyway.''People like to be entertained or amused.''It is entertaining for me..''So what is entertaining about it?''Hmm I think it is two things: the curiosity about what is going to happen and how the people deal with the situation. And.. also a third thing.. I feel empathy with the people involved. You can understand their attitudes even if it leads to disaster. You see the collision course, you see people trying to do their best, but still they collide. It is not inevitable.. but it happens, ' Kristl said. 'And what I find good was that the movie seems to go one way, then at the end you get an opposite view served. This story has twists like that. At first you think it's a simple story of a group of men who feel they have no other choice but to depose their captain during a climactic moment when he seems to fall apart. The whole movie works towards it, but at times not everything is as it seems. Some people suddenly show other sides..like people turning out to be cowards when put to the test, while putting up a brave facade when it is not needed. The end is another example of such a twist.''Yes, it was quite an twist at the end.''And that is what I like about such a movie. You think one way and then suddenly you find out that there is another way of looking at it..''So the story is OK.''Yes, I liked the story.''So how about Bogey?''It was Bogey that was not a Bogey. I mean this Queeg role he played was well done. Not the cool, collected, sharp witted, hard boiled bogey, but more like post Bogey..This is a man who is on the edge, but not so far as having buckle under. A nervous wreck.. but not enough. And this is they key to the story and Bogey plays it well.''So you like his role.''Yes. So what is your opinion?''It was okay for an old movie. I didn't fall asleep.' 'What praise!''Don't take me wrong. It is a good story.. but somehow it would have been nicer with more action.''Hmmpff.''Just saying what I think.''Well, everyone is entitled to their opinions.''Sounds like mine isn't up to scratch.''I just feel a good movie does not require action.''Yeah, but on the other hand, it should not make a movie worse. Certainly not.'www.meritcoba.com",9,1,6,20 July 2014
Apocalypse Now," Henry and Kristl experienced Apocalypse Now redux (1979)
","Had to look up what 'redux' means. It means revived or brought back. So that is what it has been done to the movie, Henry said. Revived. Brought back to live.It begs the question: why? Is it because Coppola keeps tinkering, never satisfied with the result, even if a work is hailed as a masterpiece? Feels a bit like Star Wars. I heard it gets remade too. Star Wars redux?At least this seems to be a definite version. A finished piece. A directors cut, but a bit more. I understand the movie itself has been improved. More vivid colors. So what do you think? Is it improved?What do you think?I can't tell. I never saw the first version. That is more something you might have seen.I did, but I was a long time ago. Hard to recall things. I will tell a bit about them, but you have to first tell me what you think of this version?Well, I liked it, even though it was a long sit. 3 hours. It is a fascinating story of a descend into hell.A bit like lord of the rings or Dante's inferno. A journey into darkness.Yes. You see it in the degeneration of the crew of the river boat that is taking the captain up the river where he is to dispose of that rogue Colonel. And in the worsening of the condition of situations on the river and the river banks. It gets from bad to worse. The senseless killing and murders. And the dead get mutilated. The horror as the Colonel says in the end, the horror.Would you say it's an anti war movie? I am not sure.. It seems to be more than an anti-war movie, a movie about the human condition. Cause and effect. One thing leads to another and that leads to yet another situation. And the next step builds on the previous one. It is a chain of events that don't get broken. Almost a pre-ordained result. People could have changed the outcome, but they don't change. The result is inevitable.Sounds a bit too philosophical.. I mean at any one time someone could have made a different choice. It's not like there is no possibility to make another choice, Henry said.Perhaps that is what the movie tries to convey? That a choice could have been made. At any one time. A different outcome is possible?Well. Perhaps.. It is however also an entertaining movie. Not gung-ho violence, but it slowly builds up. Only the ending is a bit.. typical.I understood Coppola wasn't satisfied with the ending himself. He thought it was too tame for modern audiences in the theatrical version. But that is what some people maintain he said. Maybe it is really just a rumor. Or humor.So can you say something about the changes?I think that there are two major changes, which is the encounter with the French somewhere halfway into the movie, which lasts almost thirty minutes, and that addition of the sex scenes with the entertainment girls. Personally I find both superfluous. The first breaks up the journey and adds a totally strange sex scene to the movie. A french lady decides to have sex with the Captain, a guy she hardly knows. Why on earth would she do that? The latter addition does in fact the same, but the first is for the Captain, the latter for the boat crew. Neither I think is a worthwhile addition in my opinion and does not add anything to the movie but adding some sex scenes. Perhaps that is more 'modern'.I actually liked them, Henry laughedI bet you do.Sex comes natural, Kristl.Even in war?Very much so in war.Hmm. I get rather upset by flying bullets and such. Disturbing in the extreme.I bet you get used to it. Even you.You think so? I would not want to put it to the test.Me neither.We can agree on that, then.www.meritcoba.com",Null,0,0,1 July 2014
The Patriot," Henry and Kristl saw the patriot (2000)
","'They were not Germans?' Kristl asked'What?' Henry said. 'Who? The English? Germans? Germans! That was a deliberate joke wasn't it.''Well, they burned all those people in that church.. Didn't something like that happen in the Second World War. Although, maybe it would be safe to say those were Nazis... not Germans. But that church thing? Did that happen? ''Well, the point is: it could have. Cause they were the enemy. That is it. Symbolism.''Ah.' Kristl said, 'So they were Germans, but with an English accent.''Sounded English to me. British English. Stuck up English.' Henry said.' Sah..' Kristl shouted suddenly, making Henry jump up.'Stop mucking about, what has that a country to do with anything? It is America against the Brits.' Henry said, 'With some French help.''Just reminds me of my now dead granddad. Fathers side.' Kristl said.'What of him?''Well, he saw this movie, back when he still lived.''I would think so. It works better while being alive.''Huh?''Being dead spoils the experience.''Duh.' Kristl pouted her lips,' Anyway. He said the movie gave him tears. You see he was always busy with those little tin soldiers and uniforms and such. And he said he liked the uniforms in the movies. And the soldiers. And the shooting. So beautiful. That is what he said.' 'He sounded a bit feeble in the brain department..''He might have been. He was in his eighties at the time. He died at ninety one.''So your granddad liked the movie for the uniforms.''He gave me this tin soldier. See. I still got it.. I thought I take it with me and show you.' Kristl held up a tin soldier with colors that was neither the blue of the Continental army nor the red of the British one. It was green with red.'So what uniform is this?''Brunswick.' 'German?''Yes, but there was no Germany back then. All kind of small and big states. Some were allied to Britain. Like Hessia and Hanover.''So the Germans were with the English?''Well, there were Germans fighting for the Americans to. In the French army that helped out the Americans. And there was a whole regiment made up from German colonists.' Kristl stared at the tin soldier.'Ok?''Well, he said. It would have been a nice movie without Mel Gibson standing in the way. If they had just kept out the action bits. Like the silly fights. And the dumb warfare.That is what he said.''What? Without Mel there is no movie. What is a movie without action, a hero and a good bad guy?''A shorter movie?' Kristl said cheerfully.'And a boring movie too. Except for crazy old men who play with tin soldiers.''Well. I thought they could have made two movies out of it and please both sides.It is long enough for it.''Nope. I don't think so.' Henry shook his head, 'It would be a short nonsensical action movie and a boring historical one. They go together.''It was just a thought.' Kristl said.",Null,1,5,20 June 2013
Resident Evil," Henry and Kristl sat through Resident Evil
","'More zombies.' Kristl said in a tried voice. She put down the empty cup that had held her raspberry slush puppy. It had not really helped with the exhaustion she felt, which had been brought on by watching a marathon of Resident Evil movies..'I like zombies.' said Henry.'Love at first bite?' 'Gosh. That is so lame and that from you..''Just tired.' Kristl whispered.'Overall an adequate movie. Zombies, shooting, people dying, weird monsters and Milla Jovovich. The tension is built up slowly as it takes a long time for the movie to show the monsters. I think they appear past the thirty minutes mark. It is a good thing. Don't lay down all the cards at once. While I don't get attached to most of the characters they aren't too disturbing. Personally I find it a pity that the Hispanic girl Rain at the end turned zombie, but i didn't feel sorry either as she might as well die, because she just kept having the same facial expression. Overall it was is pretty predictable with forgettable characters. Even to Milla seems a bit tame.' 'I find it hard to rank a movie like this. How can you compare this movie to something like the Godfather series or to stick to the same genre, movies like those from the Dead series or Aliens. Just very hard to do.' Kristl said.'Personally I think the movie marred by the start. The whole movie hinges on the fact that this super secret high tech laboratory controlled by a computer is incapable of stopping a virus from spreading through air-vents. Also a bit strange that people and dogs turn into flesh craving monsters by an airborne virus but when a few hours later the soldiers appear, they only get infected by being bitten. You have to accept that this one virus behaves in different ways depending on how it infects living beings. It might be conceivable ,but it all is a bit stretching it.' Henry said.'So..what it comes down too is an adequate zombie flick that might entertain people. Mostly people who are interested in zombie films that aren't too scary. Anyone else will probably find better movies to watch.' Kristl said'There is one thing that puzzles me and it is the reaction of Alice to the death of Rain. Although Alice reacts to the death of the others with suitable shock, she burst in tears when that guy shoots Rain in the head when she turns zombie. I mean she cried like she just lost her lover. I wonder.''Maybe she just collapsed from exhaustion?' Kristl said.'Maybe they were in love?' Henry suggested.'You thinks so?''Hot steamy lesbian love.' Henry said, 'You know it.'Not again, Kristl thought.",Null,0,2,28 June 2013
District 9," Henry and Kristl encountered District 9
","A quick word about this movie.It has been a while we saw that one... What is it? Three weeks? Henry blinked at Kristl. We should have talked about it then, Kristl slowly circled her spoon in the espresso Henry had served her. Didn't know you liked espresso.A vice I picked up after seeing Limits of Control. Two espresso in that movie. I just stick to the one. Don not want to ruin my stomach and sleep with too much caffeine.So what about District 9?We did not get the time to talk about it back when we saw it. And we never took the time after.Okay. I would that it is an unusual movie.It certainly is. I liked it.. the story of this guy who is assigned to move those aliens from the slums to another territory. Of course it is also a comment on real happenings in the world. About people being put in a refugee camp and nobody wants them. So they think of a pretense to get rid of them. Move them to someplace far away, not for their good, but because people don't want them. Out of the eye out of the heart.And there is more. For instance, the similarity with wikileaks. At the end the guy who exposes the company gets arrested and jailed for doing so. It is brought in a certain tongue-in-cheek way. The filming style is also interesting. Sometimes it is done in a newsreel style and then it moves to a movie style and back again to a newsreel. Mixing these two. Nicely done. At least, it did not annoy me.And the story was also shifting between styles. At one end it was funny, but at the other also very serious. As in deadly serious. Very deadly.Also I liked it because it sort of introduced a new kind of science fiction style. We have had good aliens and bad aliens, but these are just aliens. And they don't make them cuddly but also not very creepy. Yet they still the reminded me a bit of alien. So, overall a good movie?I agree with you. A good movie that keeps you entertained. Not a deep psychological thriller, of course. But entertaining with a serious lining. Seems we haven't got anything more to add.Well, then you can finish your espresso, and if you're quick about it, I give you another.. Uhm, well..Come on.. How can you say no to a Henry's Espresso done old style?Old style?You don't think I use an espresso machine do you?You don't? Why Henry, are you....Fooled you.. of course I use one.

Gran Torino," Henry and Kristl admired Gran Torino
","After seeing Harry Brown, this sort of feels similar in a way, totally different in another. An old man living in a poor neighborhood plagued by crime takes on a gang. But there ends the similarities.It is Eastwood's retort , a contrast with his earlier acting career by using the same symbol but then twisting it around, Krist said. She looked around to take in her surroundings. A garage turned movie- theater. Henry had put up posters of the movies they were going to see. They were printouts of blown up textures and the result had not been as nice as expected when looked at in broad daylight, but in the half shades of the theater they invoked the right mood.You mean Nobody and Dirty Harry?Exact.Not a simple vengeance film like Harry Brown.No. Not at all. A kind of revanche. Eastwood acts like an aged Nobody or Dirty Harry. But that is just for show and any similarities are mostly superficial. Yet not entirely. Both men, with little left to live for and without much time to live sacrifice themselves. Although in Gran Torino the sacrifice is meant to end in one way, in the way it ends. In Harry Brown the options are open.I liked this movie. Yeah, Eastwood makes marvelous movies of late. Pity it took a while for him to get around to it, but maybe it had to be like this. You know.. maturity.Old men making movies about old men. Is it the new fashion? Henry wondered, there must be a market for it.Perhaps.. maybe just another direction to explore..and perhaps also because that is what occupies his mind. Eastwood is old, so I guess he tends to reminisce a bit and make movies about subjects close to his heart. Like Flag of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. Or Gran Torino. A beautiful old car..If you like those kinds of cars that is.You're more a beetle kind of person, aren't you, Kristl?I might be. I never heard of a Gran Torino until I saw this movie. Cute car, but wouldn't want to have one. Looks like a guzzler to me.You're proletarian, I bet you probably don't even own a car. Indeed, I do not.So tell me, how on earth do you get around?Like most people did a hundred years ago. How else?What is that? On horseback?No.. walking, of course.All the way from Berlin ?Berlin, why would you say that? I live in Amsterdam and did not come walking all the way. I used a teleporter to cover most of the distance and walked the last stretch.A teleporter.Well, why not..

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Henry and Krist survived Resident Evil: Apocalypse
","'You might say bigger, but can we say better? What do you think?' Henry turned to Kristl.Kristl was hanging slack jawed in the corner of the couch. She was wearing grungy jeans, tank top, sleeveless jacket everything in dark grey, black and white colors. Her Jacket was adorned with button pins of music bands from the eighties:The Cure , Violent Femmes, New wave, London Calling,Beastie Boys. He felt awkward because under the angle she was lying he noticed the shape of a breast. . 'Hey, wake up!' He shook Kristl's arm.'Hmmm?''So?''What?''Resident Evil. Apocalypse? You know the movie we have been watching?''Oh yes', Kristl veered up, 'I bet a lot of people will make funny jokes with that.. Like Apocalypse for the senses. Or Apocalypse for the brain.''So you didn't like it?''It tries very hard to be unliked. As much as it tries to be liked.''I thought the more bangs and babes worked well. That female cop was a cool and hot chick. Also I liked the supporting cast more. That soldier Carlos with his Russian sidekick. They seemed to have a little bit more personality. Albeit that black American was too much cast as the comic relief. ''But the whole movie is ramshackle in it's consistency. The plot is a major problem. They know about the t-virus, but they open the hive with a few armed guards. The SUV gets hit by a truck without any explanation, so the kid is stuck in the city. It was just a weird accident. The dead in the graveyard animate. How? And why exactly at that moment they are there? The whole church scene. The zombie dogs in the school. The wall around the city. The worst is the epilogue. Umbrella detonates a nuclear missile above the city and passes that off as a nuclear meltdown. You can't pass one off for the other because the explosion pattern is completely different. And if they want people to believe it was a nuclear meltdown of a power plant, there had to be one there, so why did they not blow that one up?''Basically. the movie is sequence of action scenes. Personally I liked those and that is why people should watch them,but it simply lacks everything that makes the matrix good: a well developed plot and characters you care about. Even underworld has more likable characters and a better plot.''Yeah, the plot and the acting was just put in as an afterthought. A shame really as the games actually seemed to have much more consistency. At least from what I read.' Kristl said, 'Maybe they should just stick to those plot lines instead of making their own.''You know. That Jill Valentine. I liked her better than Alice. Not because she is prettier but because she is a human that can be hurt unlike Alice. The thing is I liked everyone more: Carlos L. J. the news person. They are all humans and all lose people and all can be hurt. Unlike Alice.''Personally I have had it with all the cool chicks that have hardly any personality. This includes Jill Valentine. What person walks into a police station and starts blowing away people like that.. People might have thought that was cool. I thought it was cringe-worthy. And I am tired of the same old tricks: like whenever someone approaches a person from behind that person is ALWAYS a monster that turns around suddenly and lunges at you. And always when they kill one monster after a desperate struggle and you think it is over, the next one or two appear.' Kristl said.'So you didn't like Alice?''Nope. I didn't care for her one bit and I was baffled those people, Carlos, Jill and L. J. came to save her. I could not believe why they would do so. And even more: how come that umbrella organization that is so highly effective in covering up the zombie outbreak, is unable to stop three people that are wanted from taking Alice away. And don't say Umbrella wanted that, because this is only shown when they leave. And why? No explanation given.''Curiously. I somehow feel you are right. If she had a little bit more personality and was less the super being that is cool. Then maybe, yeah.''That is probably the best way to describe the movie.''Huh?''Maybe yeah.'",Null,0,2,30 June 2013

","'I didn't know it was a romantic comedy.' Kristl said. She was leaning back into the couch in the garage turned movie theater,'I was completely fooled by the name and the fact it said someone wrote a statement against greed in sports. I thought it would be a drama in which someone rejects greed. Instead it is just a story vehicle to have two people meet.' 'I didn't know either. A romantic comedy! The last one I saw was When Harry met Sally. I think that was more than enough romcom to last me a lifetime.' Henry laid down the remote. 'So what now?''Maybe we ought to sit it out..You know, can we judge a movie based on the first thirty minutes? Although it has Tom Cruise in it. A romantic comedy with Tom Cruise. That is so wrong.' 'And no action. And Renee Zellweger..the girl that looks like she is perpetually on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to cry. I think she can't really act, just plays one person called Renee Zellweger with one facial expression.''She does it very well though. But Tom Cruise as an love interest. Horrible. I can't see him as a nice man in this movie, but as a sleek guy with a fake smile... but most of all, his cold eyes.. Brr.' Kristl shivered, 'But he was great in movies like Born on the Fourth of July, or Rain Man or Collateral.''To be fair we ought to watch a movie with Tom Cruise at his best. A movie where he kicks ass,' Henry said, 'Like Mission Impossible.''Beg your pardon?' Kristl raised an eyebrow.'Minority Report then?''Are you serious?''The Last Samurai?''Nope.'

She had to do it by touch as the light in the garage they had turned into a movie-theater, was still turned off. Henry flipped the switch and for a moment Greta was blinded.'And when that happens all hell breaks loose, because they have to rescue the crew from those Africans. And so they get bogged down in war for survival. That is why the general says they lost the initiative.' Henry nodded.'Those Somalians were pretty angry.' Greta remarked, 'I mean it says about a thousand of them died compared to twenty of the US and UN troops. That is like fifty for every one of them. Wouldn't you stop assaulting if you see so many of your people being killed?''Your guess is as good as mine. Our troops were the best. So it was ragtag bands assaulting crack troops. You can see it in the movie, they shoot a lot, but they almost never hit anything. And if they hit something it seems accidental.''Then they were pretty lucky shooting those helicopters down. They even have a hard time shooting those rockets at static targets like the downed helicopter or those guys in the buildings. Imagine the luck they must have had in hitting the tail of a moving helicopter.' 'It might be very lucky, but that is not what the movie is about. The movie is about a group of soldiers getting stuck in a nasty situation. Despite their differences and anxieties they work together to survive and make it out alive.' Henry said.'It reminds me a bit about that charge of the light brigade. You know where an English cavalry unit charges a line of artillery across a valley occupied by enemy troops and get all but vanquished. It was a Glorious Defeat, as they say. ''Maybe it was one, but it showed our troops could kick balls even when they didn't get the means. They had no tanks for instance because the government didn't want to give them any.''That killing made the movie a bit long in the tooth. Scott can make nice visuals, but after a while I lost track of who was who and where. Soldiers seems so much alike in a gritty movie. I also missed information about the context. ' Greta said.'Like what?''Like why did those Somalians attack and why did they keep on attacking g?. And why were the troops there. Why all this hatred? And why did that one general not know that the other general was in the city?''I think they just wanted to focus on the fighting and the comrade-in-arms mood.''And why were there so many Somalians dead? And why did those Pakistani troops in the armored trucks leave those soldiers on foot behind?''I don't know.''I read that the Pakistani general and the Malaysian commander where quite annoyed at how they are shown in the movie. They say they had a far bigger role in the fighting than they are given in movie and suffered losses too. It almost looks that they ride in and then hightail it out of town leaving those others behind.''Well, it's more about the US troops.' Henry shrugged.'I even read the comment of one of the soldiers of that other US unit. He was a bit miffed about their unit being depicted as lackluster and not doing their part.''That happens at times. Sometimes the story of one overshadows those of others.''But the final effect is never told. I read a story what the effect was of this battle on the US foreign policy.''Which was?''Soon after the US army stopped involving themselves in international humanitarian aid actions. The only reason US troops got deployed was as part of the War on Terrorism. When they could make a difference they were too afraid for another Black Hawk down. ''Someone finally got what he wanted.' Henry said.To that Greta could only agree.",5,0,1,14 May 2013
Elysium," Henry and Kristl had hopes for Elysium (2013)
","'Seems a lot of movies revolve around our suffering and demise,' Kristl whispered. Henry observed that Kristl seemed to be particular morose this day. More than usual. He had glanced at her several times during the movie. She looked worse for wear in the flickering light that the movie threw upon her face, accenting the wrinkles in her face, the dark eye bags, the unkempt hair - not black, but almost nut brown and with grey strands. 'You okay?' Henry said.'Why?''You look like you worse for wear. Like you partied all night.'Kristl ruffled her hair, which did not improve her looks at all. 'Yeah..' Kristl said after a pause.'Let me make you some coffee.' Henry went over to the kitchen in the back of their garage turned movie theater and returned with two steaming cups of coffee.'Coffee is one of those little pleasures you should have once in a while. Not too often or you get hyperactive.' Henry handed Kristl a cup. Kristl drank it in silence.More nipping than drinking.'It is also an adventure. The kind that comes with a reward. The reward being...''Longevity: no more suffering, pain and illness. Perhaps no more death.''Exact.''Heaven, so to speak. Almost literal. Elysium is up there and the earth, down here, is a place that sucks. The contrast is clear.''And the people on earth want to obtain Heaven. And there you have engine of story in a nutshell.''It is not a very worked out story. Like, the do not dwell much on the consequences or what it means. In a nutshell: it is another action movie with some bad people, who want to keep Elysium for themselves, against the rest, who want to obtain that heaven called Elysium too.''Yeah.. but that is why we have movies: entertainment. Lot of shooting, blowing up things and overcoming obstacles, defeating enemies and stopping evil. That is the fun in live.''And then you die,' Kristl said.'Geez Kristl.''A lot of people die in the movie. Killing seems to be essential.''Without danger ''.. there would be no challenge..''Right.''It's a by the numbers movie. You can swap it out for any other action related movie that pits good guys against bad ones. And by definition the others are always bad guys. Because they are the enemy.''That is the thing. Us and them. That is what movies are about. Simple decisions. Them being bad.. Us being good. An escape from life.''That is true. Pity that having Jodie Foster and Matt Damon -two good actors- in this movie does not make much difference. They have no interesting characters to play so most of their acting is lost on two stereotypical roles: the bad guy and the reluctant hero. Jodie plays the obligatory hardliner bad 'guy' lacking any conscience and eventually planning a coup against the more pliable government of Elysium. Matt Damon plays an anti hero who goes up against Jodie and her crew of killers because he is forced to.''Yeah. So.. Tell me.. Miss-know-it-all : what would you like to see changed?''Why are there always such obvious bad people?' Kristl said.'Simplicity.'' But Jodie could have been more human like, more struggling with having to make hard decisions that are inhumane. They might have presented a dilemma. There is heaven, but it is limited. So some people can live in heaven, the rest has to live on earth. Maybe they could have shown why extending Elysium to everyone does not work? But now it seems that Elysium consists of people who could help the whole world, but don't for reasons that are never given. We just have to accept this and assume they are rich people who don't want to share.''The rich man's burden,' Henry laughed.'Sounds very...Ayn Rand to me..''Huh?''That book Atlas Shrugged has something similar in it. The 'rich' withdrawing from the world to show the world that it can't do without them. Because Miss Rand lived under the delusion that rich people further progress, while the rest of the world sucks.''Maybe it inspired the story?''Maybe it did. It is as nonsensical as the movie is. Just some light entertainment.'www.meritcoba.com",Null,0,0,28 May 2014

Kristl remarked, 'Not a jump-about gun toting woman in a tight suit?''He is not a man!''Oh god, we just lost just half our audience.''He is a cowboy...''Did we get some back or did we loose the other half?''That fight in that booth is so funny. Dual wielding guns and shooting all them zombies. Kabang, kabang. ' Henry made gun gestures and with his fingers shooting imaginary zombies.'Don't forget the others, that nervous kid, Jesse Eisenberg, and the two girls, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin. They put in believable performances that make the movie whole: it is not a one man show.''Yeah, the movie has a great cast. It pokes fun with the zombie genre, but in a good way, and it is better than most other zombie movies, even the serious one's. And that cameo of Bill Murray is damn funny too. All in all a damn good movie.''I think you should practice your cowboy some more. You start to repeat yourself.' Kristl interjected.'And there are some funny running gags that are well, spaced out and given twists to keep them interesting such as the double tap: making sure a zombie is really dead by shooting it twice if necessary. Or the rules of surviving the zombie holocaust. Or the zombie killing of the week. All in all a fun movie. What do you think?''You are right. It is a fun movie.' Kristl said, 'I just hope one thing..''Which is?' 'That they don't make a sequel. It is unlikely to be better.''That's so right, pardner.'

Zero Dark Thirty," Henry and Kristl went Zero Dark Thirty(2012) on each other.
","'My my,' Kristl whispered when the credits started to roll.'Cool movie,' Henry raised his voice, while he slammed the arms of his chair, 'Come on Kristl, you can't say otherwise.''Cool is not really the word I would use to describe this movie.''All right. Here we go.... so...how would you call it then?''Impressive and reprehensible.''Eh.. reprehensible?''Let's start with the impressive bit. I think it is well made and well acted. I felt the people and situations might actually resemble something that exist in reality. There is no 'hero': a special person that is better than all the rest.. The people are believable as far as can be in a movie. I cannot say much about how real the events are, but they appear to be real enough. Although.. to be honest.. I do not believe any of it. I see it as another 24 episode. Or a movie like Syriana. A fictional thriller that depicts events that might have happened and even depicts actual historical events, but for a large part remains fictionalized.. That is what I think because I have no way to affirm the truth of the happenings in one way or another.''Ok.''It is reprehensible because this movie is a sad testimony to the moral bankruptcy of a democratic government that not only feels fit to proclaim the death sentence on a foreign person without any form of judicial process whatsoever, but also stages a manhunt with the purpose to execute him instead of arresting him, and in addition it condones the use of any means to achieve that end, including murder, torture and blackmail.''Eh? But that man killed thousands of my people. He deserved to be killed.''Point of fact: that were not thousands of your people, there were many foreigners killed as well.''Yeah, but it was an attack by an enemy on our country and we responded. We defended ourselves and the bastard got what he deserved.''Japan attacked you.. did your government then decide to send out assassins to kill Hideki Tojo? Or say, drop an atom bomb on where he lived?''That is not the same. He was a head of a government of a country we were at war with. So killing him would not only have been hard, but would probably not have ended the war.''Has the United States ever ordered such a thing? Has any democratic government ever done so?''This was exceptional.''It sure was. It shows how your government, a duly elected government from a country that some of your citizen say to be the greatest country on earth, scoffs at anything that resembles a law, international relations and, when push comes to shove, human rights or moral integrity.''Gosh Kristl. He was a terrorist. He deserved to die.'' Perhaps he did. Perhaps he should have died, but the fact that your government apparently did not even consider an alternative option but decided to execute him can only be labeled as 'Epic Fail'.''So you would not have had him killed, but instead have had him arrested? And then what? Let him go? Put him in jail and thus give every Islamic fanatic a reason to kill, sabotage and hijack in order to get him released?''Well.. Yes.''At the cost of how many lives?' Henry said.'I can not tell.''So there we have it..we kill one man but you would have had him live so many other people can be killed.''I still think it would have been better if he was arrested and put on trial like the trials at Nuremberg. Perhaps a special tribunal that had the option of a death sentence, but at least as much as possible according the rule of law,' Kristl sighed.'Well.. sometimes you have to break the law to maintain it.''If you have to do that, it defeats it's own purpose and the law has become obsolete. I think the test of a law is that you uphold it even if everything pushes you to break it.''Let's just stop.. we're never going to see eye-to-eye on this one.''No....''So the movie is a good movie as a movie.''Yes. I think it is.''Goodie. I think so too.''Hmmph.''And what is more. The bad dude dies in the end. As it should be.''How very convenient.''What does that mean?''Well, perhaps they did not want to have a process because you never know what he might say.''Like what..''Like things that embarrass people in high places. Like your enemy's enemy is your ally, until you become enemies and then the money and the weapons that you supplied your former ally with are now turned against you.''Are we back at the reprehensible bit again?' Henry raised an eyebrow.'Eh..''Just drop it.''Okay.'www.meritcoba.com",Null,0,1,17 March 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Pretty damn good.
","I am no fan of Tom Cruise, especially when cast as a hero. He strikes me as a second hand car salesman; too slick to be true. I had therefore no problem to picture him as the protagonist in this movie: an officer charged with speaking to the media: lacking any combat-experience and intent on staying as far away from any combat zone as possible. When ordered to join the troops in what his superior deems to be a walk-in-the-park landing, Tom blackmails his commander to let him off the hook, which severely backfires on him, for he finds himself soon stripped of rank among the first to land with the reputation of being a deserter who pretended to be an officer to escape his duty. The enemy are called mimics for reasons that are never explained in the movie. They resemble metal octopuses, who move at incredible speed, mostly underground. They are aliens and that is about all we learn about them and that is all we need to learn about them. It suffices that they are a deadly force hell-bent on wiping out humanity(some decades in the future, somebody will write a book about how these inhuman threats are a sign of the times, just like 70s and 80s had their disaster movies).D-day quickly turns into a massacre as the aliens wipe out the human forces before they can gain a foothold. Tom dies too, but before he does, he manages to kill one of the rarest of mimics, and finds himself returned to life one day before the landing takes place. Baffled Tom goes through the same day and tries to intervene the course of action in a haphazard way. It doesn't matter that he does because everyone dies.. and he does to. And then finds himself alive and back in time again. And so it goes. With each cycle Tom gets better because he knows what will happen, but also has a lot of time to gain experience, but dies nevertheless again and again. How does he get out of this predicament? He learns with each cycle and eventually he is aided by Emily Blunt, who has suffered from the same effects. Up till this sounds like a corny predictable movie, but the script isn't as easy as you might think. The focus in this movie isn't on the humans vs aliens conflict, but on the interaction between Cruise and Blunt and their frantic efforts to turn the only advantage they have, foreknowledge, against the aliens. The key to their success is actually their ability to convince others that Tom possesses that foreknowledge so that they help in the effort. And this is the hardest part. The script avoids giving us insight into the alien thinking. The mimics are kept as far away from the camera as possible and we never get a good clear view of them. This is smart for any alien eventually gets boring when shown too often. An example is the landing, in which a lot of carnage happens before the aliens themselves actually show up. The movie even throws us of the track by introducing a twist in the story that makes the aliens even more sinister. Perhaps everything has been planned beforehand? Yet there are flaws in the movie, such as the way Tom ends up in the combat zone. And also the ending is a bit contrived and clearly written to give us a good feel. There is nothing against a movie with a good ending, but one that forced makes for a lesser ending. Also one wonders why, having the possession of a flying craft at the start of the invasion, Tom and Blunt feel the need to have to get a car and a helicopter further land inward thus getting themselves killed time and again? Personally I think that the movie is at its best when Cruise and Blunt are together and it might have been more stronger if more time was to the group of people who aid him so that their characters would have mattered if and when they died. My learning points about this movie would be that some more time could have spent characterizing the people who eventually will aid Tom. Spend less time on the battles in the landing zone and the repeating scenes(which in themselves are shot in a way as to avoid boring repetition, which ought to be mentioned) and give more time to the final attack. My ranking gives this a 7 out of 10. This needs an explanation: in it's genre this movie is a 9.. but since ranks are given not to genre or category they are given an overall score. In it's genre of action sci-fi it deserves something of a 9. Which means it is pretty damm good.",Null,0,1,8 September 2015

","Henry and Kristl lacked The Sixth Sense.'Well acted, nice movie. I can't help to say it.' Kirstl said, 'I like Bruce Willis in this one.''It was boring,' Henry said, 'Nothing scary happened and the whole end was predictable..And I thought you didn't like kids?''Uh. I meant kids that aren't kid-like or too kid-like. You know the Home Alone kind of kids or very overdone sentimental kids..''Right. Well it was a drag. Bruce should stick to Die Hard movies or movies like Pulp Fiction. ' Henry said.'And that is it?' Kristl raised an eyebrow.'What else is there to say. Nothing happened, no action. No scary monsters. No creepy situations. And when they finally get to the point where the kid finds out he can help the dead so they leave him be, it is emoted as if he just saw his pet fish die. Let's get another movie.''Uhm. Usually that is my line. You didn't like the way the kid bonded with Bruce?. The way the mother and son relations developed? And the whole time you don't quite know if the boy is imagining things or actually seeing them. It was nice acted, a nice story and a nice script. Don't you think?''It was nicely acted, but there was simply nothing happening for most part of the movie. The whole plot could have been told in thirty minutes tops. Think Twilight Zone. Here it just drags on and on and on. People should learn when to quit.' Henry said with a certain anger.'Wow.' Kristl said, ''And all of these senseless things. You know the 'big surprise' at the end. If you look back you see there are so many loopholes and it feels like that bag of Tim's Sea Salt and Vinegar turns into sawdust after you eaten it. Just so annoying.''Hold on.''And when we know about Bruce the director suddenly gives us the tale tell signs and in abundance too. It is so annoying. And why did the kid not hide from him?:'Wait...you didn't predict the ending, did you?''Nope..But the strange thing was.. I knew it somehow without knowing it. It was like a big letdown. Like when you watch a detective movie but the most important clue is only revealed at the end by the 'great detective'. It stinks.'

Thirteen Days," Henry and Kristl held their breath for Thirteen Days
","'Nothing can ruin the carefree mood of a football game so much as an imminent nuclear holocaust.' Henry folded his hands behind his head and stretched his body as to make full use of the couch.'Blimey, we actually saw a movie that was on the good side of the average divide...' Kristl said and she handed Henry a beer. She had walked into the kitchen that was at the end on the adjoining corridor of their garage-turned-movie-theater.'Beer...? Blimey..? A positive mood? What has gotten into you?' Henry quickly secured the offered beer before something sudden would happen, like a nuclear war or a mood swing. You never knew when Kristls mood would take another turn. Women, so Henry thought, were highly unpredictable.. especially to men..' I really liked the movie. It was a good political thriller. Strange actually, considering that I knew what was going to happen: it still had me sitting on the edge. I liked it that they never showed what the other people were thinking or doing: the Soviets, the Cubans, even their own people: the US military. And although I had to get adjust for a moment, it was a good thing that Kevin Costner did not play the president but his adviser. It sort of made it more human. ''Yeah, funny... Our military was as much to be trusted as not. I can imagine that some people will not like this image of some military dudes steering towards a nuclear war. Perhaps somewhat unfair too? The Russians were the bad guys, no?' Henry mused. He savored his beer.'Soviets. Not Russians. Let's call them Soviets. And the answer: maybe.. maybe.. at least they were unknown baddies.. That makes the movie unnerving. You have no idea what they are thinking. Just like the president and his staff must have been experiencing. What are they up to? How far will they go?''And what if they don't stop?''Yeah. How did you like the intro.. how it flows from the introduction into the movie. Other than that the movie was not a cinematographic high movie. Not spectacular imagery. But well played and well written.' Kristl added.'I actually was amazed myself that I liked it.. I mean,...' Henry made a vague gesture., spilling some beer.'No damsels in tight suits shooting up legions of evil guys?' Kristl smiled.'Yeah., no action.. yet the movie scares the hell out of you. They were so hovering on the brink of a nuclear war. If the Russians had not given in.. If they had not turned those ships around..' Henry made a sudden gesture with his hands making him spill beer all around, 'BOOM!''That is true.. but than we never know if president Kennedy would have backed down himself. Or that they would have ignored the ships being there. This is of course another thing. That this issue got to be a big issue was because the US made it into a one. They were prepared to go to war over nuclear missiles stationed on Cuba not because it meant that the US could now be nuked -the Soviets could do that already- but because the US could be nuked far quicker than before. Not hours.. but minutes. It sort of evened the score in their opinion because that same threat hung over the heads over everyone else. It sort of gives you pause to think why this thing was played up. Why was Kennedy prepared to let it get this far?''Well. In the end the Russians backed down.. so the US won.' Henry said.'Won?' Kristls face became thoughtful, 'Won. Maybe. But at that point in time I wonder.. was it really necessary to drag the world towards a nuclear war over some missiles placed on Cuba? I mean really.. the Soviets could already bomb the US back into the stone age so placing missiles on Cuba was not actually changing the balance in the world by much. Maybe it was more to save the presidents prestige than anything else. Which makes you wonder... and scared. ''Let's fret not over things that are in the past. We are talking about a movie, not about some political historical discussion. I liked the movie even if there was not one action scene in it.''Uhmm. Touchy subject no?''Let us just say that it ended in a positive mood. Red lost...''And blue won?''Right.''Only not sure who was red and who was blue.'

Gangs of New York," Vapid story
","As a young kid Leonardo DiCaprio's sees his dad killed by Daniel Day- Lewis in a street squabble between immigrants of all feathers and the natives. Not the Indian natives mind you, but those white dudes born and raised in the US from fathers who stole the country from those other natives a few generations before, as opposed to all the immigrants that come over from Europe and want their share of prosperity there and then. Get of my property! So DiCaprio swears to do Day-Lewis in when he has grown up. The movie then fast forwards sixteen years into the future to come to a halt around the time of the civil war. We learn that Leonardo's desire to kill Day-Lewis has not dampened yet and he learned all kinds of usual skills that help progress him and society towards a better one.Of course not: he just knows how to kill people with a knife.Perhaps the movie has some deeper meaning by showing how utter vapid the life of Di Caprio is as it is solely geared towards one violent goal. If he is to represent the Irish immigrants that came to eek out an existence it is lost on me. Blame me for not getting it.The next two hours then might see interesting things about the historical background of the US in the late 19th century or even about the life of the immigrants, but nope.. it is all about a gang of criminals. The kind that plague society any time in any setting and is filled with thugs, hoodlums, scumbags, crooks, sadists and profiteers and anyone else preying on other people. But perhaps that was the message?The US is made by criminals?It takes DiCaprio around two hours to do in Day-Lewis, which he could have done by gunning the guy down in the first 15 minutes, but nope, he needs to linger because of reasons. Moral ones. DiCaprio shows nothing redeemable and what I see is a person who has thrown away his life and sense by wanting to destroy another for nothing but revenge. No noble goal is guiding him. It is just bloody revenge.Get a life dude! There is some kind of romancing going on between him and Cameron Diaz, which is probably in there just to extend the movie even further for it feels like they just go through the motions. Diaz is a unlikable as the others, only she is female, so maybe that is her excuse.For my life I can't figure out why anyone would sit through this movie that has such unlikable lurid characters. Perhaps the acting is great, but really, why would you watch two hours of bloody violence, an awkward romance and nothing else? There is another movie about gangs called the Godfather, which is also about a group of criminals and also about immigrants. It has drama, character building and other things going for it. This movie just can't compare to it. It is almost as if Scorsese wanted to redo the Godfather in another time, like a precursor, but simply lacks the quality of writing to help him tell the tale. Perhaps Scorsese might have given Shakespeare a try by turning it into a west side story kind of thing, but it has nothing of the love story, nothing of the sad tale. It is just a boring movie about one guy wanting to do in another and taking two hours to do it.",2,7,14,13 April 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Max or Furiosa?
","With a bare bones script and set in a bare bones landscape the movie wacks the audience with visuals and helter skelter chaos in what boils down to one long pursuit through a rocky desert that recalls Mad Max 2: the road warrior. Is this the road warrior redux? Perhaps it is in a way, but then it's infused with a touch of borderlands(the game) for it's over the top weird characters, with names like: The People Eater, The Doof Warrior and The Bullet Farmer. There is no way describing them, they have to be seen. The movie keeps a stringent pace once it get's going, which is almost right from the bat, after we are (re)introduced to Max and the setting. Tom Hardy is a worthy successor to Mel Gibson, perhaps even better for he has a rather more edgy attitude, which is why Max is called Mad after all. In the first scenes he gets captured and while he tries to make his escape, he finds himself dragged along as war trophy perched in front of a car that is part of the pursuit of the War Rig, a massive truck-trailer combination commanded by Imperator Furiosa(Charlize Theron) who is trying to escape the War Boys of the Tyran Immortan Joe with his most adored treasure: his five nubile wives. The chaos increases when the first of the pursuit catches up with Theron and Max tries to escape them, while the War Boys try to kill him, Furiosa and get the War Rig to stop at the same time without killing the wives. Once the first of the War Boys have been dealt with by Max and Furiosa, the fight is between them at first, but eventually necessity turns them into allies. Later on they are joined by Nux, a Warboy who is forced to switch sides. A lot is smartly interwoven with the pursuit. There is the awkward love relation that develops between Nux and one of the girls. There is a kind of respect developing between Max and Furiosa. There is even some pondering that gives the movie a deeper feel. And there is even a very Boschlike scene when the War Rig travels to a swap-land where the Crows live. The fight scenes are a marvel to behold, almost everything fanciful is flung at the War Rig: pole riders, trucks, bikes, monster trucks, armored cars, flamethrowers, hooks, chains and a high speed saw among them. All in all this is a well made movie in which the star is Theron who overshadows even Hardy due to her personality. It's not because she pretty in this one, -for she is not- she is gritty, dirty and bald, but it is because she brings Imperator Furiosa to life. It makes me wonder whether the next installment in the series will be called Mad Max.",Null,0,2,8 September 2015
Contact," Gawd calling(gooodmorning America!)
","After spending a third of a trillion dollars Ellie, played by Jodie Foster, finds herself at the other end of a worm hole. That is to say: back on Earth. It took her 18 seconds to do so.Earth, inhabited by moronic creatures called humans, has just found itself to be the target of practical joker living on a planet orbiting Vega or thereabouts. Thereabouts cause that planet was probably just a relay station. It send them humans an instruction manual for building a device nobody on Vega or thereabouts could afford to build, hoping them dumb humans would do it. And they did. In fact, they made even two of them. How stupidly funny is that.To their great embarrassment one of the earthlings appeared so they sent it back with some garbled message that would have the slow witted creatures pondering stuff for the rest of their pathetic existence.What is next? Ellie asks her dead daddy, the guise the alien has assumed for her(and not Adolf H, which would have been funny). Well, we sent you back without a shred of evidence and nobody will believe you. And we erased all the tapes, and the audio and anything that could proof we exist. How about that? It will be just like.. a religion! You feel right at home!Fine with me, Ellie says. For as we have found out from the movie, Ellie doesn't believe in gawd.. but she does believe in something after having had her trip to another world. So she has become a spiritual person so she can have intercourse with the religious guy named Palmer Joss without feeling ashamed for it. (In hindsight the painful look on her face when she kisses Palmer might very well be because Foster was a closeted lesbian, which by Jove would at least have made the movie more interesting if Ellie had been too. Nuke them straight people! )So the whole movie, aptly named Contact, was about finding an excuse for the atheist (assumed closeted lesbian) Ellie to have (straight) intercourse with the Christian Palmer. Two third of a trillion dollars spent on matchmaking and brain reprogramming.. Does this movie get closure that way? Perhaps it does.The more I think of this movie, the lower my scoring. The biggest part of the movie turns around a conflict between science and religion, in which the latter means: the Christian faith of the American kind. 95 percent of the humans are religious someone says to atheist Ellie, which is why she doesn't get selected at first. She could have replied: but only a third of them are Christian. So who will it be? A Christian volunteer? A Muslim one? A Jewish? A Buddhist? Which religion shall be required? And if it will be Christian, which denomination? The catholic one? Oh and did I tell you about my sexual orientation? Only 4% of the female population confesses themselves to be lesbian. And how about white vs black vs Asian? What race shall represent earth? But we just skip over that one shall we.. cause, darn it, this is America and there is just one American gawd and that is the white Christian one and no other exist!And.. the American atheist gets to finally go after the American Christian dude and the first alien device gets blown to smithereens by an American religious nutcase cause them Americans prefer their own American atheist to go after all in their secretly build religious nutcase free intergalactic American travelling device version two so they can adorn the alien property with an American flag. Only they forgot to give her one. The nicest part of the movie is the beginning sequence, in which we see no humans at all. The camera travels backwards from the planet into outer space. Cool that! In between there are some more nice shots of desert landscapes and some sequences about the planets. As long as there are no humans in it, the movie is actually nice.Jodie Foster, how I like her, is at her worst here. She seems constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, about to scream or about to cry. Why did they send that nervous wreck to the aliens? No wonder they returned her and without any evidence so they will not send another one. Cause them humans are just too stupid to get that travelling through wormholes mucks with space and time. But you know.. Einstein is dead and with him all the brilliant scientists have died out.. Stephen Hawking? Never heard of the guy. Carl Sagan? Wasn't he a script writer for sci-fi movies? Higgs? Penrose? Witten? Just a bunch of loonies. The movie has also Blofield in it. He is named Hadden. Hadden is a deus ex machina. When the plot grounds to a halt, he steps in with a lotta money and gets it floating again. Jup.. the movie is almost brilliant. But there aren't any cats in it though so it remains almost.At the end of the movie Ellie is back were she started: in command of a large array of antennae listening to the universe. Did anything happen in between? Apparently not. It was all a dream probably or maybe she got back to another Earth in another universe?
