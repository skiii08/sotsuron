The Blair Witch Project," It's so scary because it's so real
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a damn scary movie! The premise: three student film makers go into the woods to shoot a documentary on a witch legend, then disappear. Their footage is found months later and this film consists entirely of that footage. The making of this movie is nearly as interesting as the movie itself. The two guys behind this film, made for just a few thousand bucks, didn't so much write and direct it as conceive it. They gave their three actors a broad outline of the story and two cameras, which the actors used to actually shoot all the footage themselves. The movie looks amateurish because it is, but that only adds to the horror. We see the three characters start out as cocky college kids, but wind up as terrified, cowering animals, hunted by something in the woods. What we never quite find out.  In this day of computer generated monsters it's nice to see a horror movie where not everything is shown. The fact that we often must listen intently while looking at a dark screen or shaky, out-of-focus camera work only makes it more real. Our imaginations are engaged. This movie is something like Orson Welles' great 'War of the Worlds' radio stunt.  Cool, scary stuff if you allow yourself to get into it.",Null,1,2,21 August 1999
American Pie," A surprisingly sweet teen comedy
","'American Pie' sounds like your average teen comedy, but it  has a certain sweetness that wins you over despite some rather gross gags along the way. A cast of mostly unknown but gorgeous teen actors star as high school kids struggling with sexuality and love.  Four senior boys vow to lose their virginity by prom night, and set out to do so in varying ways.  We laugh at their fumbling attempts, but also root for them to succeed.  In the end, we've seen a guy 'do it' with an apple pie, but also seen a realistic portrayal of teen love.  What's more, the featured characters are not jocks, cheerleaders or even popular.  It's refreshing to see a movie that would even assume high school seniors could be virgins. 'American Pie' is a fine date movie and will entertain young and old alike.",Null,1,1,10 August 1999
There's Something About Mary," Simply the funniest movie of the 90's.
","'There's Something About Mary' is an all-time classic comedy.  I put it up there with the best work of The Marx Brothers, Monty Python and Mel Brooks. The Farrelly Brothers, who gave us 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Kingpin,' wrote and directed this gross-out hit.  You've doubtless heard about the hair gel gag, the 'franks and beans' scene and the hilarious torture of Puffy the dog.  But if you haven't seen 'Mary' yet, you are in for a very pleasant surprise.  Yes, it includes some of the sickest gags ever, but it also is an unexpectedly sweet love story that will actually touch you and have you rooting for stars Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller to get together. Guaranteed to be the funniest movie on the new release wall at your local video store.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Not for the casual movie fan, but serious fans will love it
","At last, after 12 years of waiting, Stanley Kubrick's new film is in theaters. Alas, it's also Kubrick's final movie... The great one died in March shortly after finishing work on 'Eyes Wide Shut.' Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in a dreamy, surreal exploration of human sexuality, love and jealousy. Like all Kubrick films, 'EWS' will only be understood and truly appreciated after repeated viewings, but I offer here a few first impressions. This is a gorgeous movie, full of intense primary colors, lovely natural lighting and the wonderful tracking shots Kubrick has made famous. The performances by Kidman and Cruise are both exceptional, but the supporting cast is possibly even more impressive. Those looking for titillation won't find it here; instead, this is a serious study of the intense emotions that lurk just below the surface in most if not all marriages. The story begins with our sexy couple going to a party, where they get separated and both engage in some serious flirtation, but nothing more. Later, back at home, they discuss the evening in one of the movies strongest scenes. Perhaps to make Cruise jealous, Kidman tells her husband about a man she has been fantasizing about for months, a Naval officer she saw only in passing, but who she says she would have given up everything for if he had only asked her to. Before Cruise can react to Kidman's riveting speech, he's called out on business (he's a doctor,) launching him into a night of bizarre sexual and romantic encounters that play like a feverish nightmare. It culminates with a bizarre masked orgy at which Dr. Bill is deemed to be an interloper and is threatened with death if he reveals what he has seen. Back at home, Kidman tells him about a sexual dream she has had in his absence, and as the rest of the movie unfolds, we begin to wonder what is real and what is a dream. I won't reveal more of the plot, but will say the movie ends on a hopeful, romantic note, something Kubrick fans have seldom seen before. Some critics say the ending is a sell-out, but I kind of liked it. The final word spoken before the 'Directed By' credit is, it seems to me, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, the most cerebral yet sensual director America has yet produced. A note for casual movie fans: this is not for you. Audiences used to the pace of sitcoms and 'Armageddon'-type films will not be able to sit still for this 2-and-a-half hour meditation on the human condition. People behind me in the opening-night packed house bitched and moaned throughout about the pace, that nothing ever happened, etc. What's more, they laughed at totally inappropriate places. Obviously meant to see 'Big Daddy' instead.",10,0,0,18 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Schlock, Rock and Two Boring Hours
","'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells' is just out on video, and what with the glowing reviews and comparisons to a personal favorite 'Pulp Fiction,' I was really looking forward to this British film a lot. Boy, was I disappointed! This movie has a needlessly complex plot dealing with mobsters, poker losses, pot growers and a bloody hiest. I had a hard time following the plot, mostly because this move is way too talky. Yes, I know, Tarantino also writes talky movies, but at least I find his dialoge entertaining. If this film's talk is as smart and witty as Quentin's, I certainly didn't get it. Then again, the dialogue is laced with British slang sure to baffle American audiences and the accents are at times a bit hard to understand. Good rock soundtrack. I challenge you to stay awake and interested in this over-rated bore.",Null,1,3,23 September 1999
The Iron Giant," An adventure film with a message
","'The Iron Giant' is a wondrous family movie. It's animated but not a child's cartoon. This is an 'ET'-style fantasy in which a young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space and teaches him about life among us humans. Young Hogarth Hughes works to keep his over-size buddy from being discovered by his loving Mom and the US government. The movie is set in 1957 Maine, and it nicely evokes the paranoid atmosphere of the cold war era. People assume the robot is a secret weapon of the commies, but in the end the giant saves us all from nuclear disaster. The animation is clean and lively. The giant moves with a mechanical fluidity thanks to computers, giving it a different look versus the hand-drawn human characters. The director of this film is a former producer/writer on 'The Simpsons' and 'King of the Hill,' but here he refrains from the biting cynicism of those shows without crossing over into the sentimentality of most Disney movies. There are no cute animal sidekicks, no musical numbers, no happily ever after. But 'The Iron Giant' is a smart, sweet must-see for animation fans of all ages.",Null,0,4,21 August 1999
