Iron Man 3," It's good Could have been better
","Well I can't say the movie was very good but yes it keeps you entertained the Robert Downie Jr way. It has just the amount of action and they have managed to add the laughing scenes.The script has nothing new but the way they have presented it is different, Stark is amazing and Guy Pearce is just cool, every actor has done a fab job and director keeps you on the edge of adrenalin rush.Too good of a action movie and yes they have learned to make a suitable and longer climax for this one than the other 2.Over all the movie was good but I expected more. I give it a 8.",10,2,4,4 May 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Awesomely Unexpected Story.
","Peter Jackson's Awesome a director who knows how to edit a story and make the best of it, This movie on 3D is just awesome shooting and projection at frame rate of 48 fps makes it a first film, looks blurry at some scenes though.The introduction of each character and the slow narrating makes u curious, Had a High expectations but din't live up to it hope the next part 'Desolation Of Smaug' delivers it.The fight scenes are just amazing and better than LOTR, each and every character portrays their character perfectly. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is a epic Character to look out for. the end credits increases your curiosity begging for more. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is the right choice for the role the scene where he comes out to save Thorin ( Richard Armitage ) got my goose bumps up.All in all peter jackson has struck again making such an epic picture out of a children's novel is no like reaching no man's land..I give it a 9 despite of all the efforts put in.",9,2,6,8 March 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An Epic fantasy adventure ever made
","Peter Jackson one director, one trilogy amazing combination, A Director who made us live each and every moment of the LOTR, No one could have made it better.the whole cast and crew was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing journey and delivered world class performance, Frodo(Elijah Wood) is just too good as an hobbit carrying the burden of the ring, Gandalf ( Ian McKellen) is just unimaginably powerful, Aragorn ( viggo mortensen ) being the king of minas tirith is too awesome to resist, the other character like Legolas and Gimli the old rivalry turned friendship is fun to watch.overall a movie made once and can never be made again and shall stay that way for long years to come in fact words fall short writing a review about such an epic fantasy adventure.I wish there was 11 to vote...",10,0,1,31 May 2013
