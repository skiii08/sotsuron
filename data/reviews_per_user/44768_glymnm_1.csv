Hereditary," The abortion of bad film
","What makes me really upset is that there are so many struggling talented story tellers and film makers who don't have access to funding or A listed talent and struggle a life time... when people like this really don't understand the story structure process fo telling stories. I was hoping this film will bring back classic horror genre but instead I was left to feel insulted. 
A day in my family is way much more interesting than the film. Pay me and I promise you a great true life horror of parenthood.",1,1,5,10 July 2018
