Skyfall," Skyfall
","This is the first James bond films I have seen and I just loved it. Firstly I would like to say that Daniel Craig was the perfect actor for James bond and I just loved the action through out the film. Explosions, chase scenes and the death of one of the main characters M. At times I found it a bit slow and boring but I found it interesting and I love the idea of how they use one of the cars from the classic James bond films. Also this film was so good that I might go watch the classic James Bond films starting from 1963 Dr No. I also love the music in James bond by Adele and I just like listening to it when I am writing reviews. Overall I would recommend you seeing this film it has some cool actions scene and sometimes very dramatic overall I found the film good. Thank you for reading this review please read my other reviews.Henry.",8,0,4,8 June 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Very good classic, a must see classic!!!
","I remember first seeing this film and my dad wanted me to watch it so I did and I just loved it. The film takes place in the 30s and Indiana Jones is searching for a golden treasure in a deep forest with his crew (which is the perfect plot for the start). So then he goes into a cave to find it and find lots of traps along the way, from spike walls, to a giant pit and shooting darts it can be very dangerous but not for Indiana Jones. So he manages to grab the idol and exit the cave, but then people take the idol from him and so he runs off and escapes. He then returns back to his home and then a guy comes in and talks to him about going on another adventure so he sets off to India and battles bad guys with his whip and kicks ass. The movie is over 2 hours long and has lots of action and disturbing scenes at times but is great classic to watch.",9,0,1,27 January 2014
Ted," Ted review.
","This movie was just funny as hell like funnier than family guy even though the voice of ted is peter Griffin from family guy. There are some rude scenes during the film but it was just funny as hell. The plot was interesting and funny at the same time the jokes are crack up and it also had other actors that were from family guy like Jo swat-son the police man in a wheel chair. Ryan Reynolds also appeared in the film as well which was interesting. What also surprised me was the amount of swears in the film like F**K, S**t and many other bad swear words. But that OK because Seth Macfarlen always has swears in his TV shows and movies. Over all I thought it was interesting most of the time Ted was either being funny, Drunk, taking drugs or fighting a duck. Over all I would recommend people seeing this film that are fans of family guy.",9,0,8,29 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The amazing spider man review
",The amazing spider man was a interesting film and I just loved it before it came out I was just dying to see it and on that day when I saw it I thought was just amazed with the film because they finally got rid of Tobey Maguire and I thought Andrew Garfield was the perfect actor for spider man. He was young and people actually liked him compared to Tobey Maguire (No offence). Also they had an interesting villain for the film called the Lizard and I thought he was cool as well. The plot of the film made sense and I also liked the costume for spider man I thought it was great the 1 problem with the costume is the eyes for the costume because they were black and when they were suppose to be white like in the comics I just hope they change it in the next film coming out in 2014. Also if you look at this link below it will give you a bit of information for the next film http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=YQ2FCqdlvBM. Now people that have not seen the film yet do not click on that hyper link. Also the next villains in spider man 2 are Electro and Rhino.Thank you for reading my view please have a look at my other reviews for other films. Henry.,9,0,1,23 May 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Hobbit 2, Very good film
","The Hobbit was released on the 12th of December 2013 and I saw it on the 15th of December at Albany event cinema in New Zealand, Auckland. The film starts off in the past with Gandalf and Thorin drinking in a bar. It then continues on from where it had ended in the last film and in the first 15 minutes of the film there is already action where the dwarfs, gandalf and Bilbo run into a small home and rest their for the night. They then continue their quest into a forest then gandalf gets a message in his head to go meet something in the mountains leaving the dwarfs to go into the forest without gandalf. They fight spiders in the forest and they're captured by elves and then get away and make it to the mountain where smaug leaves the mountain and goes out to destroy everything. Leaving it at a huge cliff hanger for part 3. In conclusion I loved the film with it's action, humor and fantasy that peter Jackson created. Thanks for a great film peter Jackson.Thanks for reading my review and I will be posting more reviews soon. From yours truly your friendly neighbor hood friend: Henry Agnew",8,1,5,15 December 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best Marvel film so far??
","The film guardians of the galaxy was made by the Marvel Studios and is probably the best marvel film they have made so far from all the marvel films. The film is set in space and I really enjoyed the settings of the film because all the Marvel films I have seen have been set on earth, except for a little bit during The Avengers film. The film has some of the best actors such as Chris Pratt who plays as Peter Quill aka Starlord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax The Destroyer, Bradley Cooper voiced as Rocket Raccoon and Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot. For all the fans of Thanos who are reading this right now, let me tell you that you do see Thanos in the film and he looks amazing, also the character Ronan who is the villain of the film looks awesome as hell. The soundtrack used in the film is also very good. The Comedy in the film is great from the rude comments by Rocket Raccoon to Groot and his funny facial expressions. The only down side was the after credits scene which really made me mad, I will not say what it is because you can find out what it is, but I warn you it's terrible. Overall I think this film was just amazing, for all the fans of Marvel that have read this and haven't seen the film, please go see it, NOW!.Thank you for reading, by Henry Agnew",10,1,4,7 August 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," The shawshank redemption
",The Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is set in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to prison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another man during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the perfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice it's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long and that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does somethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change to the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to read and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the prison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was just fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this: Mr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and then he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from prison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each other and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be violent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times. Anyone that has not here is the trailer : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco. My name is Henry and if you want to see more reviews check out my page but for now goodbye.,10,1,1,6 June 2013
Iron Man," Very good film
",I have seen the Iron man film so many times and I would like to say that I never got sick of the film. What I also liked about this film was that the director had used the original intro just like the comic book series in the 60's. I also like the Iron man mark 1 Armour I just loved it even thought it was only in the film for like 5-10 mins I still think it was just amazing. I also loved the actor that played Tony Stark a.k.a Iron man. He was funny and just perfect for the role of Iron man. I thought the plot was interesting and I thought the villain (Iron Monger) was also interesting and what I was surprised with was that his outfit was Silver and not blue from the comics and in the Iron man 2 figures number 35 you can see the classic Armour of the Iron Monger.Overall I thought this movie was great and I would Highly recommend people to see this film especially for fans of Iron man.,9,2,3,7 May 2013
