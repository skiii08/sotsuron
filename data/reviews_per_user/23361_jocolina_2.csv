Your Name.," A very pleasant surprise!
","I'm not used to write movies' reviews but this one deserved with huge merits. After read other reviews, I encouraged myself to do the same. Although I have been always a anime fan, this movie surpassed my highest expectations. My wife was a little hesitant at the beginning, but she was truly amazed. 
Although I watched the Spanish dubbed version, the dialogues kept the main essence of the story and the characters delivered a wonderful performance. The visuals were magnificent, for both environments (Tokyo and Itomori). The premise of the movie seemed quite simple and repetitive, but I didn't see this coming. My wife and I were in suspense until the very last minute of the movie. It is a must-watch definitively.",10,4,5,30 January 2018
Die Hard," An unbeatable classic of the action genre
","A classic, according to my Literature teacher in high school, is a work worthy of being imitated. That is Die Hard. I was a teenager when the film premiered. I went to the theater with a friend and very low expectations, since I am more a sci-fi guy than action one. When I left the theater, I was like 'Wow, this was a thing' and became an instant fan of the franchise. I recommended this movie to all my friends telling them that it was different than other action movies of that time. One of these differences was how the hero suffers the continuous wounds and ends as a complete mess. In the scene when John McClane extracts a piece of glass from his foot, you can feel the pain of the protagonist. The trope of a standard guy against the odds was born with this film.
Another high point is the villain. I know more Alan Rickman for this role (Hans Gruber) than the one in Harry Potter. A charming, polite and smart antagonist is more appealing than a guy that simply hates the world. I enjoyed the humor of the movie with simple situations like the requirement of Hans of releasing a terrorist of a unknown group. His partner shrugs when listens to Hans and he told him: 'I read about them in Time'.
I am aware that the later releases of the franchise don't surpass this movie, but I enjoyed all of them. In my opinion, this a breaker of the action films genre.",10,0,0,23 September 2018
