The King's Speech," Inspiring story well told.
","The movie does not open with the Weinsteins saying 'we thank the Academy for their consideration' but beyond this omission this film is pure Oscar bait. And frankly it deserves to garner a number of the naked yellow ditch diggers. Most assuredly one of these should go to Colin Firth who plays the spineless, stuttering King George VI-one of the more unattractive royal characters in recent memory-with historical accuracy but yet making him a sympathetic character. A second statue should go Helena Bonham Carter. Although she has to do little more than be encouraging and sympathetic to her hamster of a husband in this film she turns in yet another great performance and this plus a string of memorable characters in a long career should get her the award. Geoffrey Rush will also likely win although his character is the unfailing witty, charming hero throughout the 2 hour run time so he really didn't need to work that hard. It should also win a slew of technical awards for cinematography, art direction and costuming - the production is impeccable. This Best Picture nominee shoe-in and likely favorite to win has only those shortcomings common to large-scale historical costume dramas - the run-time is a little long, some parts slow beyond comfort and it lacks a real personal connection beyond the miniscule portion of the audience that remembers these events. Also, 'The King's Speech' has to be the least compelling title in recent memory - where were the marketing people? If Hooper's creation doesn't come up big Oscar night part of the reason may somewhat represent fatigue over the sheer number of movies about English royalty of late ('The Queen', 'Young Victoria', 'Elizabeth' and 'Elizabeth 2', 'The Duchess', etc.). Speaking of which, when does Wallis Simpson get her big screen treatment? The older, twice divorced American born 'Bessie' briefly ruled one-fourth of the world through her domination of King Edward VIII and wound up with a Duchy. Her story cries out for a biopic.",8,1,2,6 December 2011
Despicable Me 2," Meh, about what you get with sequel
","Much like Cars 2, Despicable Me 2 relies too heavily on secondary characters meant to be the comedic leavening to the main protagonists the first time out. Much like Mater gets nauseating in large doses, the minions (or allergy pills with eyes) get to be more annoying than cute when brought to the fore. This main issue rises from generally flat writing that attempts to stick too closely to tropes presented in the first installment rather than trying to break new ground. In fact, the only real laugh comes from Agnes asking Gru dressed as a fairy princess why a fairy princess would be fat and he responds: 'because I live in a house made of candy and I eat instead of facing my problems.' Beyond that most of the humor comes from minions doing slapstick which just isn't that funny unless you are six years old. The voice talent does an admirable job lead by Steve Carrell doing his non-specific Eastern European accent. Unfortunately, we never hear from Gru's mother whose complicated relationship with her son drove a lot of the interest for adults in the first one. In short, watch the first one again instead.",5,11,18,2 August 2013
Moneyball," Like a satisfying double-header
","Clocking in at 2 hours, 13 minutes, 'Moneyball' requires a commitment. Beyond time, an interest - or at least a lack of aversion - to mathematical concepts and, obviously, baseball also will aid in the enjoyment of this biopic. While athletic Brad Pitt does a reasonable impression of athletic former ballplayer Billy Beane, the true star is author Michael Lewis. Lewis is contemporary literature's foremost writer on men, money and the risks the one takes with the other. His ability to illuminate the arcane economic theories the character of Peter Brand (the Oscar-nominated Jonah Hill) brings to bear on baseball player selection gives the book and the movie real heft. Hill likely does not deserve the Oscar nod for player a fairly uni-dimensional statistician who is not taxed to demonstrate any real emotion (unless awkward is an emotion). At least the wildly miscast Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't get one for the cerebral actor's misguided attempt at portraying put-upon Oakland A's manager Art Howe. Beyond these three men the other characters are largely forgettable former (mostly) baseball players. In short, if you like baseball or numbers the film is a must-see but otherwise you'll find it overlong and lacking true dramatic engagement.",6,2,3,7 February 2012
The Avengers," Is too many good guys a thing?
","In a late scene Hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible super-villain in the film - Loki - and you realize having a team of superheroes - even one that spends a lot of time bickering - does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team. The superheroes also include an indestructible beast - the aforementioned Hulk - and an immortal god - Thor. Like the old Jerry Seinfeld line about Superman - 'why would he needs the rest of the Superfriends - he's Superman!' Why do you need, for example, Hawkeye - essentially Katniss Everdeen with piercing blue eyes - or Black Widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather? This leaves Robert Downey, Jr.'s Ironman who, by contractual arrangement with the $25M a picture actor gets all the good lines. Two in particular, when he calls out an extra for playing Galaga and refers to Thor as 'Point Break' are instant film classics. Unfortunately, Whedon, like the rest of us, is slave to RDJ's ego so he's left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete Captain America ('there's only one God and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that') and one-note Samuel L. Jackson ('hey you guys, we need to fight back!'). Having said all that, although a little talky, the film presents expensive-looking prolonged and noisy CGI action sequences which distract, if not entertain. The movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for a meaningful but not creepy length of time (Gweneth Paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times). An excellent cast (actor's fees only must have hit the $100M mark) also contributes to a worthwhile outing. In short, this confused story of overwhelming good versus one overcompensating pasty evil younger brother with bad hair staring at for its 2 1/2 hour run time.",5,3,8,1 December 2014
Black Swan," Entertaining despite technical flaws.
","Horror film? Variation on 'All About Eve'? Upper class 'The Wrestler'? Aronofsky's creepy tale of sanity loss in the pursuit of greatness has garnered all these reasonable speculations but all hit the mark less well than 'David Cronenberg tribute.' Nina's (not a great name for this character) hallucinations of physical deformity (fused toes) and real injury (back sores) hark back to Cronenberg's 'The Fly' and 'Videodrome.' The creepy relationship between Barbara Hershey's mother and Natalie Portman's dancer strongly resemble the twin gynecologists in 'Dead Ringers' but perhaps the better comparison is the mother-daughter team in 'The Piano Teacher.' When you steal from greats, being derivative is not a sin and Aronofsky should be credited rather than blamed for this. However, he should be blamed for the film's repetitive and nauseating's 'Cloverfield' 'shaky-cam' cinematography. We follow Natalie Portman across the Lincoln Center courtyard so many times audience-members begin to suspect to find a complex security pass in their purse. The club scene shot in multi-color strobe which precedes Nina's drug-driven detour from reality mirrors almost exactly a similar scene in 'Basic Instinct.' However if you can get over the claustrophobic close-ups and other visual shortcomings, a compelling horror story about trying to tell reality from fiction and largely failing (kind of like 'Naked Lunch') underlies the precedings. Aronofsky manufactures some true shocks and doesn't compromise on the end. Bring your mother!",5,3,6,6 December 2011
Howl's Moving Castle," Must see in the kid's anime subgenre
","This weekend took the kids to another Hayao Miyazaki film known as 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiroâ? in Japanese or 'Howl's Moving Castle (2004)â? in English. The film is advertised as being based loosely on a novel and I would hazard to say the loosely part probably has something to do with the injection of Miyazaki's frequent themes which include allusions to the Hiroshima bombing, and pacifism. However, this time out Miyazaki doesn't demonstrate the environmental concern normally prevalent in his work. Our eighteen year old animated heroine is Sophie who hides from society after being cursed into old age by the Witch of the Waste. Miyazaki borrows some elements of 'The Wizard of Ozâ? in the witch's name and in the form of a talking scarecrow. Sophie takes refuge in the moving castle of the title and consistent with the dream-like quality of Miyazaki's films, this keep is a monstrous contraption composed of thousands of moving, steaming and grinding parts on 4 spindly legs powered by a fire demon called Calcifer. Howl is a self-centered wizard who is struggling to avoid being drafted into destructive war along with the rest of the kingdom's magic denizens. The war is over the disappearance of the prince of the land â' a plot point that does not become important until the very end of the picture. Markl, Howl's apprentice and Suliman, his former tutor, round out the cast of good and evil respectively. Sophie's first task is to bring order to Howl's castle and by extension to Howl himself who is extremely powerful but largely adrift in self-indulgence. Her second task is to get the Witch of the Waste to lift the curse which she ultimately fails at because Suliman tricks and disarms the Witch first. Sophie makes peace with this former enemy and winds up caring for her. It is left to the newly focused Howl to defeat his former tutor lifting the curse from Sophie and from the scarecrow who turns out to be the missing prince thus stopping the war. The story drifts quite a bit and there are definitely points in the film where things grind to halt. However, the animation, particularly the actual castle, are amazing and this helps to carry the audience through the 2 hour runtime.",8,0,1,5 December 2011
The Hangover," Original and absurdist
","Highly original mix of raunchy comedic, snappy dialogue and absurdist situations. The Hangover is the comedy you always wondered why Hollywood doesn't make. The movie manages to combine the smarts and observation of 'Juno' with the absurdist situations of Marx brothers movies and frames all of it in an R-rated Las Vegas romp. The non-linear narrative structure makes for a re-watchable film that is destined to be a cultural touchstone along the lines of 'Stripes', 'Better Off Dead' and the 'Revenge of the Nerds' series. Best comedy since 'Tropic Thunder' although that was a better and more substantial film.",8,1,2,5 December 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Like the book-better than the title would suggest
","Seth Graheme-Smith's central premise - that slavery represented a boon for vampires and one that they were willing to fight for on the confederate side of the U.S. civil war - works unexpectedly well. The movie plays out the more goofy part of the notion - that Abraham Lincoln fought them individually and later collectively as President - as a straight-up action movie in line with 'Air Force One' and the like. Some reviewers have faulted the film for an overly serious tone but given the campy nature of the concept itself, this taking itself seriously also works well. Basically, adding to the camp factor would have produced an annoying trifle rather than a watchable, if limited, American action picture. While the protagonists (Benjamin Walker as Old Abe and others) come across as fairly bland and serious, the vampire characters come across as menacing and, pardon the pun, bloody-thirsty particularly Erin Wasson as an evil seductress. (where was she when they were casting Catwoman?). The battles they fight although implausible (including on top of a train falling into a canyon) do make for some entertaining action sequences. In short, a popcorn movie worth a discount rental, just try not to think about how fighting something with the ability to turn invisible would pretty much be a non-starter (unless they had a really powerful smell).",6,0,1,28 November 2012
Gravity," A technical if not narrative achievement
","With just 2 characters, 3 if you count Ed Harris's voice in the darkness, 'Gravity' asks a lot of both the actors and audience to sustain interest in a technically impressive but not dramatically impressive exercise. Basically, 2 astronauts, Clooney at his charming best and Bullock (kind of dowdy in this one), try to find a means of survival after a cascading series of space disasters. That's it as far as story - somewhat reminiscent of Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea' in terms of minimalist plot. The obvious rigging, digital and blue screen motion capture impress in the same way they impressed in James Cameron's 'Avatar'. However, like the big blue aliens with human boobs, Bullock doesn't have a ton of witty dialog or plot twists to work with and much of her actions consist of twisting knobs, flipping switches and the like. Much of her emotions come down to desperation and exasperation. Much has been made of the technical holes but no talks about Bullock's character's admission that she is still deeply affected by the death of her daughter in a traffic accident. How did that make it past the psychological review before she was sent in space? In short, far more of a technical achievement than a great story.",7,0,3,3 July 2014
Citizen Kane," The ultimate must-see film.
","Given that 'Citizen Kane' has owned the best-film-of-all-time lists since the mid-1950s and that it was called the same by the ultimate film critic Robert Ebert, I'll have a limited amount to say about it other than to agree that Orson Welles' masterpiece is the film you need to see a few times in order to have a technical yardstick to judge others by. Like many of 2010's Oscar Best Picture noms ('Avatar', 'The Hurt Locker', 'Up' and 'District 9'), the basic plot is not quite up to the technical prowess of the film. Welles uses deep focus, framing of characters in the background, and other special effects techniques that would give today's $200million USD extravaganzas a serious run for their massive piles of money. His aging of Charles Foster Kane from age 25 to old age is as realistic as anything you'll see in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' or any modern blockbuster. His use of cutaway titles (such as the neon sign above the night club) which the camera magically flies through presages the interactive titles in 'Zombieland' or TV's 'Fringe'. In short, much of technical aspects of film-making in any post 1941 film will seem derivative to the Welles masterwork. The story itself is compelling but not overly so; however, it does lay the basic arc from super-stardom to has-been to crazed collector living alone in a crumbling palace for several biographies of actual people (e.g., Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley). In short the answer to the central trope of who is the 'Rosebud' of Kane's dying words doesn't turn out to be that interesting but the trip to find out is well worth your time.",9,0,1,5 December 2011
The Maze Runner," Maze Runner: The Search for Women
","An extended pack of newly pubescent boys wanders parent-less in a lush 'Glade' (did Albert originally pen that name? It seems a little college freshman 101 English for a kid) and yet they display no obsession with the lack of women? Did the wiping of their memories also give them an interest in gardening to the extent that they are reluctant to try to solve the ridiculous cement maze that surrounds them? In real life, the lack of female companionship would have meant more boys would be volunteering as maze runners than hanging around building lean-to's as occurs in the film. Teresa's arrival - the first woman many had seen in 3 years - might have started an out and out civil war. Putting the sexual (or lack thereof) politics aside, the movie presents a fairly book-y device of a government in crisis using scarce resources to build a massive climate-controlled, cyborg filled intelligence test which takes 3 years to produce results. Couldn't they just have administered the Wechsler and saved themselves 2 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours and a billion dollars? Applying a fair amount of disbelief the story itself is a relatively straightforward one of group problem solving under adverse conditions. The twists at the end are dopey but do serve to set up a half billion dollar sequel. The characters and their characterization leave the audience whispering: 'who's he again?' Only Will Poulter's 'Gally' distinguishes himself as the voice of conservatism against the more charismatic, liberal Gladers. His views are compelling and one assumes had the grievers not mounted a mass attack, he probably would still be the Glades's democratically elected leader. How he shows up at the end of the film makes no sense within the story's own logic - remember the giant metal blades shut beyond the group? In short, a not un-entertaining also-ran among the 'Hunger Games', 'Divergent', dystopian future subgenre.",5,0,0,6 March 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Good for your romance language class, not so much for history class
","What to do when you find that the dialog you wrote for your historically inaccurate revenge fantasy doesn't quite live up to 'Royale with Cheese' standards of your earlier work? Translate it into 3 romance languages. The French (29%) in particular lends an air of sophistication but don't use to much Italian (1%) as it can feel a little cheap unless it is in the context of an opera (see the much better film 'Amadeus'). To further extend the faux sophistication extend our your scenes to a wildly unnecessary length. Some of these scenes, particularly the opening interrogation of a French farm family harboring Jewish refugees in Nazi-occupied France and a tense bar scene later in the movie while the murderers who are the good guys (as opposed to the murderers who are the bad guys) try to avoid blowing their cover as Nazi soldiers, draw out so to an interminable length. We all know all Tarantino scenes end with everyone in the scene save one getting shot - can't he just get to the point more expeditiously? To be fair the costumes and set decoration are excellent. Christop Waltz's performance is stellar particularly in contrast to some overdoing it from Brad Pitt whose accent somehow sounds like he is an European doing an American accent despite being from Pittsburgh. In short, while self-indulgent and in need of an editor, the film nevertheless will entertain Tarantino's core fan base.",4,1,3,9 July 2015
World War Z," Can Max Brooks resell the film rights given the book went unused
","Imagine Max Brooks, who wrote the book by the same name and which was the supposed source material for this big budget popcorn film, sitting down at the premiere and wondering if he wandered into the wrong screening. Some film adaptations stray from the book, this one used nothing more than the title. However, out of sheer financial power, the resulting film comes across as a fast-paced, slickly produced action-adventure movie. The badly-coiffed (was he growing out his hair for a future role while filming) plays generic good-guy: smart, paternal, intrepid and, as always, good-looking. His globe-trotting would have exhausted James Bond as he searches for a way to quell a zombie (and is there a more stupid concept?) outbreak. Violating George Romero's prime directive, director Marc Forster's zombies in this particular outbreak run and are pretty scary when provoked. However, when not in attack mode the actors forced to play them look distractedly unsure what they are supposed to be doing - some stand still while others bang their heads against parts of the set and others nash their teeth in what is supposed to be intimidating but is mostly just dopey. Maybe give them some clearer direction Marc? Speaking of zombie rules, apparently helicopters don't count as noise as we see in Fort Israel but singing (and everything else) does (if a zombie crashes into something does that send all the others running?) Of course, you can complain ad nauseam about the plot and logic but you have to give it up for the expensive looking and engaging set pieces most of them involving plans or helicopters. Although the movie decidedly decelerates and loses its big bucks sheen in the final act, the non-stop, edge-to-edge excitement entertains up to that point. In short, the cliché' is to impress people by saying the book was better, if anyone tells you that here you know they didn't read it given the film bears not even a passing resemblance.",6,1,2,18 November 2014
The Hunger Games," A mildly entertaining cinematic take on a mildly entertaining book.
","Suzanne Collins monster hit series based largely on the collected writings of horror-writer Stephen King comes to the big scream with a can't miss fan base. Thus, the director Gary Ross's only true challenge is to just not screw it up. He succeeds. To be fair, Ross does take the extra step to clean up numerous shaky plot points (such as the torture porn death of Kato that mars the end of the book) and devices most especially the first person narrative which limits the development of backstory and B plots (realistically, once Katniss enters the Hunger Game arena all we should have known is her quest for food and water). Ross also does a nice job of peppering the cast with real actors including Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci as well as Jennifer Lawrence herself. Given that the core 12 year female audience lacks any interest in such matters must have represented a temptation to hire cheaper talent. Ross adequately captures the brutal action in the book and smartly drops out before the long, meandering final section. However, the CGI very much comes across like CGI and two often the film feels like a car commercial. The cimenatographic slickness undercuts some of the emotional scenes quickly jumping away before Katniss' emotion can fully land. It blunts the viciousness found in the book without papering over it but still results in a non-recommendation for those younger than fully in the pre-tween ranks. In short, the mediocre King- homage (or ripoff depending on how much of his stuff you've read) makes for a somewhat entertaining book that wears is 2 hour 22 minute running time well.",5,2,4,18 February 2013
Argo," Based-on-a-true-story filmaking at its finest!
","The often-ridiculed future The Batman Ben Affleck deservedly picked up an Academy Award for Best Film for a suspenseful retelling of a complex rescue operation during the Iranian Revolution. Much like Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13' the movie builds far more audience anxiety about how the story ends than any event that actual happened and can be pulled up on Wikipedia has a right to. Between these films, Argo stands as the superior accomplishment given the degree of difficulty. The complexity of the times portrayed and the number of conflicting constituencies involved in the story could have easily turned this into a morass of indecipherable political intrigue. Yet Affleck keeps the parties and their motivations straight in the minds of the audience. Casting choices add strongly to the entertainment value particularly the always fascinating Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Allan Arkin. The proceedings go a little long but this adds to the eventually drama around whether all the pieces would come together to get the six hostages out of the country rather than being hung from construction equipment. In short, the most deserved Best Picture winner since 'Michael Clayton' in '08 (I didn't say Michael Clayton won, I said it deserved to).",8,1,3,15 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," So...the emotionless logician as romantic action here...that's 1 way of approaching it
","In the unnecessary sequel of the unnecessary reboot, widely panned director J.J. Abrams and the guy who came up with the ending of 'Lost' give us the Stoic science officer as the romantic (Uhura, really?) Schwarzenegger-esque action star. Meh. Like Syndrome said in 'The Incredibles' when 'everyone is super, then no one is super.' The 'Team of Rivals' logic falls apart, why then do you even need Kirk when Spock can negotiate with Khan and later beat the stuffing out of him on a futurist garbage truck? (So in the future garbage trucks fly but Kirk still uses an alarm clock to wake up between the alien women?). If Abraham doesn't stick enough to the logic, some of the actors stick too closely to the past especially Karl Urban who essentially does a comic's impression of DeForest Kelley. Simon Pegg flirts with the same problem with his 'Scotty' but just narrowly avoids turning it into a caricature. Chris Pine does 'Kirk' without Shatner's cheese factor but Jeremy Renner could have taken the character in a more interesting direction. Otherwise the actors make the characters their own particularly Zoe Saldana who brings a re-imagining to the originally flat Uhura character. For Abrahams, the Enterprise crew clock in as stock players in the service of his superstar Benedict Cumberbatch. JJ actually films his introductory scene with a standing applause break lingering on his excellent cheekbones to the point of communicability. From there the camera never really moves off him and he enjoys several bouts of evil super-villain monologue-ing as the rest of the cast looks on admiringly. Maybe re-reboot the franchise and make Kahn and his crew of augments the good guy next time? The plot remains familiar to fans and the action engages and entertains even when it makes little sense: the heavily damaged Enterprise loses engines and weapons but not artificial gravity, the Enterprise needs a huge crew of engineers but the ship one model more advanced can be full operated by one aging Star Fleet admiral, Kahn Rambo's an entire Klingon patrol with air support but...Anyway, enough decent action and writing exist to carry the popcorn adventure through its running time. In short, it may be where many man have gone before but might be worth another visit.",5,3,5,1 December 2014
Ted," Like a middling 'Family Guy' episode
","In his directorial debut Seth MacFarlane does not wander far from the 'Family Guy' tropes that made him wealthy. During a party montage the film even admits the voice MacFarlane uses for Ted mimics that he uses for the Peter Griffin character. It is these montages and asides that are MacFarlane's strong suit (basically 'Family Guy' is an referential and observational stand-up comedy routine held together with a nominal plot) and their lack makes the film somewhat plodding. MacFarlane is forced to rely more so on plot which represents a challenge which he attempts by cobbling together a coming of age story about Mark Walberg's delinquent loser character and a talking teddy bear. Walberg feels much too put together to pull off the pot-smoking middle aged delinquent and Mila Kunis is much too one-note to be of consistent interest. The teddy bear character is just stupid and ultimately adds little to the proceedings a more conventional character couldn't have sufficed. However, some laughs pepper the over-long affair although they tend to be of the 'in December comes a very special day - the day the neighborhood kids beat up the Jewish kid' variety. In short, watching back-episodes of the show on Hulu represents a better return on time.",5,0,1,21 November 2012
Creed," Captures the spirit of the original while staying contemporary
","To make a film in the dramatic spirit of the first 2 'Rocky' movies (before the character drifted into superhero territory) but to make it still a contemporary film is a neat trick and the work pulls it off nicely. Since the late 1970's boxing has drifted out of the main stream and again become a niche sport (without Google-ing whose the current top contender for the heavyweight crown? Or for that matter whose the current heavyweight champion?). The film reflects the new reality with Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed working the Mexican boxing circuit and holding down a job before leaving to find roots beyond those provided by his father's true wife. While Jordan looks little like Carl Weathers and his dower serious mien tracks not at all with Weathers' portrayal of the elder creed as a charismatic showman who dances with the late James Brown, he physical command of the sport makes for a solid if not compelling leading man outing. Award shows have already given kudos to Stallone for committing to a now humbled, hampered Rock Balboa. The somewhat tacked on final scene of him leaning on Jordan's character to make it to the top of the Philadelphia Museum of Art steps to see the statue of himself that institution longs to rid itself of makes for one of the most compelling in the film. The film itself does well with exploring themes of fatherhood, defiance vs. resignation and identity but less well with actual plot which follows the Rocky formula like an 8 year old following a Martha Stewart recipe. In short, an entertaining film in it's own right and a nice addition to the series.",7,0,0,11 May 2016
Rise of the Guardians," Tired characters run around
","Had 'The Santa Clause 3' not recently employed Jack Frost as the antagonist, 'Guardians' might feel quite as tired as it does. Unfortunately, Martin Short's uncomfortably creepy (seriously little girl, don't go into the snow globe room alone with him!) but admittedly memorable turn does make it tough for this film to feature him not as the heavy. Instead Jack must battle what looks like the minority version of Rene Auberjonious' character in 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' who is trying to make a comeback in a word where kids really are frightened of anything anymore (as noted in 'Monsters, Inc.). Jack's costars aren't much help in building a sense of relatedness. Alec Baldwin sticks a thick Russian accent on Santa Clause. Not to offend our Euroasian, formerly Soviet, brethren but Russia isn't exactly known for being giving and certainly not for being jolly. Hugh Jackman lays the Australian accent on the Easter Bunny equally as thick and between that and his animated twitchiness one wonders how any kid ever sat on his lap. To round out the team, there is a Tooth Fairy drawn in that nebulous region explored by '30 Rock' between being too realistic and too unrealistic so that the effect just comes out hard to look at. There's also the Sandman who speaks in icons and has putting people to sleep as his one easily replicated (see 'The Whitney Show') superpower. All of the shopworn characters spend the moving running around in quick cut Technicolor trying to restore the dreams of children or some such other plot cribbed from Rankin Bass. In short, wait for Christmas and then watch 'The Year without Santa Clause' instead (the Cold Miser could kick Jack's frosty ass).",4,3,11,1 April 2013
Insomnia," Intriguing Daylight Noir
","Firm noir stands as one of the most challenging genres. By their nature the shades of grey characters require a deft touch to produce a relative hero and relative villain among the flawed characters. Contrast that with the slasher genre where one just hires a group of attractive but wholesome looking teenagers and one unattractive white guy, colors a few buckets of corn syrup red and you are good to go (by the way, this is also the recipe for a Tarrantino movie just add way too much droning dialog). Insomnia is good film noir. Nolan uses the breathtaking Alaskan scenery (although like the 'The Proposal' somehow the movie was shot on one of the handful of beautiful, warm, summer days in Alaska rather than the other 340 frigid ones) to set a backdrop of overexposure and to sell the central premise that Pacino's LA detective can't adjust to the failure of the sun to traverse the sky. How Nolan got Hollywood's two biggest (outside of Nicholson and anyone in a Tarantino picture) scenery-chewing actors - Pacino and Williams to turn in subtle, nuanced performances is a mystery worth an Oscar in itself. Pacino's age occasionally comes off as problematic in the film as several pivotal scenes require a level of athleticism that he clearly no longer possesses (the famously fit Williams never seems over-matched by the demands). Hilary Swank has the opposite issue, she seems just a little too experienced to play the fawning, impressionable wannabe detective who uncovers Pacino's dirty, big, secret. Like any Nolan film, little annoyances pepper the outing such as the abortive relationship between Pacino and the hotel clerk - they seems close despite not spending any time together. In short, however, the smart, atmospheric mystery is worth the viewing.",7,1,3,14 September 2015
My Neighbor Totoro," Early work of a later master.
","You won't see the brilliance of some of the later Miyazaki films ('Spirited Away', 'Kiki Delivery Service', 'Howl's Moving Castle', etc.) in this early (1988) Studio Ghibli production. Some of the trademark Miyazaki visually arresting elements are there - particularly the fantastic catbus. His mastery of artistic representations of natural elements (rainstorms, waves, etc.) which made 'Spirited Away' and 'Ponyo' such true works of art are here only in a pale reflection. 'Tonari No Totoro' also does not delve into epic storytelling of war and environmental collapse as the later works do but does tell an mildly uplifting child's story of coping with sickness and displacement using the power of imagination. In short, if you are already a fan of Miyazaki, you should see the film to round out your experience. If not eschew this one in favor of his later more mature work.",5,3,10,6 December 2011
500 Days of Summer," Best romcom since 'When Harry Met Sally.'
","Children, once upon a time the romantic comedy was a legitimate movie subgenre. Then along came people like Matthew Mcconaughey (don?t care if that is misspelled) and Jennifer Lopez among many others who began to pump out unfunny and unromantic films which all seem to not only have the same plot but basically the same characters (all of whom have well-defined abdominal muscles). Now children, these weren?t bad people ? even good actors like John Cusack fell for the temptation of making a coupla? bucks off the 18-54, white, female, movie-going demographic. Ah, but children, there is hope in the form of video-director Marc Webb who has created a romcom with real (fake) emotion, actual laugh-out-loud moments and an intriguing plot which defies the traditional conventions of the subgenre yet still delivers a satisfying ending. The film is cast with a focus on brains over abs so that when Tom falls in love with and later can?t get over Summer we actually understand why and feel what he feels. The nonlinear narrative structure (don?t panic children, you?ll get it) keeps the audience going alert and thinking and the soundtrack carries the film when necessary but doesn?t intrude when not (listen for Simon & Garfunkel?s genius ?Bookends? ).

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Kevin Costner Exonerated (sort of)
","When Kevin Costner's ill-fated 'Waterworld' beat the previous production cost record for Hollywood films by approximately 75%, no less a critic than Roger Ebert quipped that there must have been some fabulous lunches given the look of the product that made it to the screen. Some twelve years later, Ebert's line applies to Verbinski's 'Pirates 3.' Both films spend their ducats on big stars (the obviously aggravated Costner and the enthusiastically guy-linered Depp respectively), elaborate floating sets which eventually get blown up real good and enough extras to bring the U.S. unemployment rate down a full point. 'Pirates 3' has the extra cost that 'Waterworld' did not of the requisite CGI now standard on all films not labeled 'indie.' The CGI animators create a mass of mock crabs that carry a galleon across a desert, a ship that floats on either side of the ocean's surface and one presumes the tentacled beard of Davy Jones (unless that was all puppetry). Expensive spectacles all to be sure yet Davy Jones' appearance reminds one strongly of the much more convincing aliens in the South African film 'District 9' a movie that cost reportedly 1/10th the price. 'Pirates 3' likely contained more than 10 times the amount of special effects but this amounts to overuse of the technology resulting in the 'Transformers'-type visual confusion and difficulty following the action. The excessive CGI is manifest of an overreaching director's vision, again much like Costner's 'Waterworld.' To put it bluntly the film is too damned long clocking in at 3 hours if you count the advertisements and previews most theaters now tack on at the beginning of the screening. Long running times do not represent an inherent evil - certainly broad sweeping biopics such as 'The Aviator' or films that need to acclimate the audience to a very alien world such as 'Avatar' require more than the requisite 88 minutes. The third in a series of films based on one of Disneyworld's least interesting amusement park rides maybe doesn't have the grand narrative arc to hold the audience's attention quite that long. Beyond being too much to follow and too much to sit through there is too little interesting dialog, clever repartee and compelling relationships. Depp and Rush clearly compete for attention, Orlando Bloom as overstayed his welcome and more interaction between Depp and Keith Richards is not forthcoming likely because of Richards' limited acting ability (Mick Jagger he is not). In short, rent 'Waterworld' instead - at least you can follow the story.",4,1,2,6 December 2011
Midnight in Paris," At least not as bad as most recent outings
","Much of the praise for this mismatched collection of freshman art history inspired stories emanates from critics' desire for Woody Allen to finally get his groove back after a twenty year string of unwatchable films. Allen pulls out the elements of past glories but they serves them at a discount given his reduced stature. Paris stock footage replaces filming in Manhattan, Owen Wilson does a California hippie version of the quick-witted New York neurotic character and the antagonists are one-dimensional stock Tea Party baddies. The think premise involves bringing past painters (Picasso) and writers (Hemingway) to life but giving them little of interest to say to nebbish-y Gil the main character who travels backward in time to meet them. Only Adrien Brody entertains by playing Salvador Dali as a frustratingly over-the-top lunatic – perhaps Brody has far better comedic chops than we all suspected. The arc of the story follows a path predictable from the outset and only the ghosts of great lines from Allen films of the 70's and 80's serve to break up what feels like twice the 94 minute run-time. In short, wait another probably eight months for the next Allen theatric attempt.",Null,0,2,25 August 2011
Once," A well-told little tale.
","'Once' demonstrates that entertainment can be made for what was likely less than 3 weeks craft services budget on 'Avatar.' It recounts a week in the life of a busker and an immigrant hustler who find inspiration to take a leap of faith to move forward rather than continuing to rely on excuse that start with 'once...'. Despite being unnamed the lead character quickly become important to the audience in a way CGI-driven leads in 'Avatar' and the film that beat it for the Best Film Oscar 'The Hurt Locker' never did. The music feels authentic as does the dialog and plot again in contrast to most of the implausible story lines fostered on today's audience. However, all this simplicity comes at a price. This is a short story with a plot that feels more like a transitional chapter than a complete tale of any sort. While Hansard and Irglova produce touching music together, there really isn't much of it and the third time around the same duet tends to lose some of its charm. In short it worth watching unless you haven't seen the somewhat similar (also about musicians at the career crossroads in Dublin) 'The Commitments' in which case see that instead.",5,0,1,6 December 2011
Ready Player One," Points for degree of difficulty
","Like 'The Girl on the Train' and any Dan Brown book exactly what makes Ernst Cline's novel excellent makes for a just decent cinematic experience. The novel engages in dense and luxurious world-building and an intricate puzzle-box plot which unfolds degree-by-degree. By necessity of their compressed run-times, movies need to get through the set up (unless you are M. Night Shyalaman whose films constitute mostly setup). The medium limits the plot points to only a few switchbacks (again unless you are M. Night Shyalaman and you put all your switchbacks into a one big reveal). The limitations present headwinds that Spielberg takes a mighty swing at slipping but with limited success. The film's key draw, as you would expect, come from Spielberg's immersive and imaginative visuals and not from the rushed plot or flat performances. The motion picture also provides nostalgic value to those of a certain age through dozens of visual references ('there's 'Bigfoot', the king of the monster trucks back in the 80s!'). In short, to misquote the immortal words of the Gin Blossoms, if you don't expect too much, you might not be let down'.",6,0,0,10 April 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' if Indy was young and Belgian
","Spielberg digitally exercises his penchant for highly elaborate action sequences in this adaptation of the Belgian serial cartoon. The media allows the director to supersize these set pieces to epic proportions including floods and entwined flying sailing ships. Your reaction to the movie will largely depend on whether you find such rapidly unrolling mayhem exhilarating or tiresome. One suspects the film will split somewhat along gender lines with boys, in particular, finding the flying machines and crashing cars to be a good time. A note to parents that the action here, like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', is served up with a pretty healthy degree of gunfire and alcohol consumption by Captain Haddock and, oddly, Tintin's dog 'Snowy.' If the film has the feel of 'Raiders', it surreptitiously cribs the entire main action sequence from 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.' In fact, the use of digit special effects, the presence of pirates and entangled, burning boats make the sequences difficult to tell apart. In short, the film isn't quite the 'event' that Spielberg envisioned but it is solidly entertaining in that old-fangled cliffhanger serial way.",6,0,2,2 January 2012
Megamind," Bring your little middle aged guy!
","Easily the most humorous moment of an often hilarious film involves a reference to Marlon Brando's performance as Jor-El, Superman's biological father in the movie of the same name. The parody is as potent as Superman's heat vision with Brando's mumbled, near-incoherent delivery, Conan O'Brien bouffant and ridiculously cheesy costume captured exactly. The interesting part of this involves realizing that the reference exceeds 30 years of age meaning to get it you likely need to be at least 40 years old. The other visual references include 1989's 'Say Anything' and the 10 year old 'A Beautiful Mind' suggesting a writing staff firmly in middle age. However, kids will enjoy the film for the rapid pacing and multi-dimensional action sequences and perhaps the best use of the 3D gimmick in this incarnation of its rediscovery. Will Ferrell, whose career can generously be described as hit or miss uses the exaggerated emotion in his voice-work as Megamind to excellent effect. While Patrick Warburton would have been a much better choice, Brad Pitt effectively nails the self-aggrandizing Metro Man by basically being himself. Also in the good but not great voice work casting category, Tina Fey has to be smart but sincere rather than sarcastic in the Lois Lane/Vicki Vale role called Roxanne Ritchie. Reese Witherspoon from 'Aliens vs. Monsters' would have been a better choice. The excellent 'Aliens vs. Monsters' represents the closest cinematic cousin to this film with less entertaining 'Despicable Me' a close second. In short, this is not quite 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'The Incredibles' but a very, very good time at the movies. You might also bring the kids (although they might wonder what you are laughing at).",7,1,2,6 December 2011
Horrible Bosses," Another work-themed disappointing outing from Jason Bateman
","While not as inexcusably awful as Jason Bateman's foray into the manufacturing sector in 'Extract', he hasn't exactly exonerated himself with the workplace comedy 'Horrible Bosses.' To be fair, it's not Bateman but the bosses that don't quite work here. While the usually excellent Kevin Spacey's exploitative boss does ring true, Bateman's character wants his dead largely because he wants his job. This motivation would work better in a noir rather than a comedy. Nice-girl Jennifer Aniston takes a crack at playing dark as a newer comedy-stereotype-the perverted dentist. The problem here is that the writers need to twist themselves into knots, even putting their protagonist on the sexual offenders registry, to explain why her male dental hygienist would reject her advances. Why not just make the character gay? It would have made so much more sense and provided an interesting dynamic. The third horrible boss played by Colin Farrell spends so little time on the screen, we are not clear why he needs to become a target of a murder plot. The movie does get points for being upfront about the lack of moral rectitude of the three main characters who are, after all, resorting to murder to make their working lives more pleasant. Similarly, it is upfront about the 'soft' racism of the three white, male, early-middle aged characters in their interactions with Jamie Foxx as a con man and an Indian technical support rep who is central to the end of the film. The film may be among the last that will be able to try to wring most of its funny out of prolonged sequences of wild profanity. The shock value of shocking language has largely lost much of its voltage through overuse and increasing familiarity. In short, the far more subtle horror of the bosses in 'Office Space' or Sigourney Weaver's fashionista in 'Working Girl' far better earn a homicidal fate.",4,6,13,3 January 2012
Capote," Artistry worth of its subject.
","Bennett Miller's matches the dark story of Truman Capote's research on the Kansas Clutter murders he made famous with gorgeous dark establishing shots of the Kansas prairie. These frame equally visually arresting shots of domestic and prison interiors of the 1960s so well done that the scenes of the Clutter's murders still shock despite pervasive cinematic violence. Philip Seymour Hoffman's impeccable performance needs no superlatives, his impersonation's exactitude extends to how he holds a newspaper or a fork, only Charlize Theron's performance in 'Monster' as Aileen Wuornos is its superior. The story of the development and writing of Capote's 'In Cold Blood' derives the big screen treatment as it includes murder, execution, and most interestingly Capote's ruthlessness in working his relationship with Perry Smith, one of the murderers, into a confession. The story aptly captures the pain and sacrifice necessitated to create great literature. In short, well worth seeing.",8,0,0,6 December 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," Underrated among the Pixar offerings.
","'Monsters, Inc.' is among Pixar's best because it constructs a clever, convincing world from the single childhood experience of being afraid of what lies behind the closet door. Pixar opens that door and plunges the viewer into a funhouse mirror of society with puns, inside jokes and pop cultural references ('Scare Different'). Goodman, as his name implies, was an excellent job as the voice actor for the talented but naïve Sully and Buscemi oozes menace as his foil. The plot is sufficiently frightening to drive the story forward and the laughs are high-brow enough for adults and slapstick enough for the kids. In short, one of the few DVDs actually worth owning.",9,0,2,6 December 2011
Southpaw," Inadvertent Rocky III remake
","In this corner the champ 'Rocky III'. In this corner, the inadvertent remake 'Southpaw'. Gentlemen, keep the blows low and the fight dirty. BEGIN!Round 1: Main character name. The champ comes out swinging with the titular title character 'Rocky' invoking a time, place and ethnicity. The laughably bland main character name in 'South' - Billy 'The Great' Hope - sounds the writers were trying to come up with some intriguing name but eventually principal filming needed to start and they couldn't answer the question 'The Great' what? Did they mean he is the Great Hope? But not the Great White Hope with it implicit kinda racist overtones? Anyway, few real boxer nicknames and no movie boxer nicknames can stand again the memorability of the 'Italian Stallion'. And the challenger is down and the fight end early!Round 2: the kid: The challenger avoids the early knockout with Oona (that's a name?) Laurence's portrayal of Billy the Goat...er Great's daughter who is traumatized by the shooting death of her mother and Billy's incompetent parenting. While Laurence winds up just shouting at the televised climatic fight much like Ian Fried's Rocky, Jr. does, at least she has a character arc and some dramatic moment. Looks like the fight is on.Round 3: the death that pushes the champion into a downward spiral: and we got ourselves a battle! We had 2 fully 'Rocky' movies to come to know Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill so his heart attack before the first Clubber Lang fight is affecting. However, given how much Billy and Leila rely on Maureen to parent them both, her shooting by Miguel Escobar's squad equals the pathos of Mickey's death.Round 4: the baddie: Oh, and the champion comes back hard! The monster of 80's cheese Mr. T. somehow projects both a menacing and ludicrous screen presence. He plays the hungry, scrappy underdog that Rocky was before his Ferrari and house robot made him soft. Miguel 'Magic' Escobar amounts to little more than off-the-shelf disrespectful thug with little to distinguish him from his crew.Round 5: the savior trainer: But the challenger isn't done yet! The excellent Forest Whitaker plays the also unfortunately named Tick Willis (seriously, who came up with these character names?) He is kind to street kids and who takes on Billy when he is at his lowest point despite Billy treating him like crap and he is some kind of boxing training savant (his expertise is never explained). While the round goes to 'Southpaw', Carl Weathers Apollo Creed (see, that's a great character name) is a mostly one note Rocky support system for Rocky but his physical attractiveness and easy smile makes his a highly engaging actor to watch on film.Round 6: the big fight: And the challenger is against the ropes! The eventual Escobar Vs. Hope or 'Magic' Vs. 'The Great' battle excels at verisimilitude and therefore not so much at drama. An open Hollywood secret director Antoine Fuqua missed in film school is that while audiences complain about the lack of realism in movie boxing matches, they actually want them to include dozens of uncontested punches per round. Balboa Vs. Lang includes enough haymakers to give both men CTE before the ring girl strutted around the ring with the '4' card. When Jim Lampley's monolouging during the climatic Miguel / Hope showdown is the most interesting part of the proceedings, your fight staging is a little too accurate.And the challenger is out! There won't be no rematch or a 'Southpaw' sequel for that matter. The plodding, overly serious, staging of a story that's been done better multiple times before unfortunately wastes Gyllenhaal's impressive physical transformation. In short, 'Rocky!', 'Rocky!', Rocky!'",4,0,1,22 December 2017
Nightcrawler," Way creepier than your average 'scary' movie
","Give it to Jake Gyllenhaal for pulling a copy of the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5) and looking up the characteristics of a sociopath. He lack of empathy and blinking, the muscle car, the sudden outbursts, he just nails the real sociopaths who wander the streets around you every day. While slow to develop, the movie excels at asking some difficult questions about sanity, social mores and The American Way. Both Gyllenhaal (Lou) and female lead Rene Rousso's (Nina) characters succeed largely by being will to go farther than their competition. Certainly for Bloom he crosses the line into deliberate murder but Nina's morality is trickier. She gives herself completely to Bloom to get ahead at the television station where she runs overnight news. She manipulates the truth and enable's the initially small- time criminal Lou's unlawful behavior while showing no remorse or concern. So is just a career woman trying to get ahead by whatever means necessary and can't be held responsible for Lou's actions? Or is she guilty by association? The movie also raises questions about sanity. Certainly Lou's view of his 'business' (Video Production News) as an organized professional firm is at first fraudulent and self-deluded. Or is it? Don't we celebrate people who built people who build major businesses based on some self-deception and that of others? Or does Bloom really see himself at the center of a thriving organization that just hasn't coalesced in the physical reality around him yet? The decided lack of morale to the story at the end of the film strongly recalls a 1992 Tim Robbins movie about the film industry called 'The Player'. In this busy as well (all businesses?) the dirtiest player who doesn't get caught wins. 'Nightcrawler' delivers these starkly discomforting lessons in a slow-burn, too-real-to-life story. In short, if you want real scares, see this movie and realize these type of people are all around.",7,0,1,26 June 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," May have been too smart for demographic
","To paraphrase the old cliché, pop music in the digital age is never about about the music, man. 'Popstar' rips into an admirably broad set of pop music conventions and events including, hysterically, U2's force-feeding of its album to Apple users, awareness - raising songs about popular topics as a way to boost cred and sales and, most notably, the pervasiveness of music-by-committee. As the spot- on named 'Connor4real' says: 'it takes a village to make me look dope.' As that quote suggests the writing lampoons modern hipster vernacular as well as it does modern entertainment dynamics. Beyond the opposite of tone deaf writing and subject matter, the film delivers more Easter eggs than the famed Bunny. This may partially help explain why it was only lukewarmly received. There's so much insider baseball, somewhat obscure references, meaningful cameos and stuntcasting it may have just overwhelmed the 12 to 24 demo that largely came to see it. Also this reliance on such of-the-moment comedy fodder may mean the movie won't age or travel well. In short, best to see it soon before everyone forgets the Bieber / Anne Frank incident (remember that? well, Justin was...).",7,0,2,19 October 2016
The Aviator," Epic craziness.
","Crafting a biopic about Howard Hughes is like running downhill - no more interesting and complex personage graced the 20th century and perhaps with the exception of Ben Franklin and maybe Abraham Lincoln maybe all of United States history. The challenge Martin Scorsese faced involved mostly keeping the fascinating stories about Hughes to just the film's 170 minute running time. Scorsese holds the movie to under 3 hours by focusing only on Hughes' establishment of TWA and Hughes Aircraft and his film production career. Although this period probably covers the most cinematic of Hughes' adventures it does miss his rise to become the biggest employer in Nevada, stints living in London, South America and finally the Caribbean. It also only covers just the early days of his madness which progresses to a far more debilitating stage later in his life. Leonard DiCaprio delves into this madness and the Hughes' genius delivering a convincing and compelling role. He never quite loses himself in the role in the way Charlize Theron could no longer be discerned in her performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos - we always see DiCaprio behind the character. DiCaprio appears in nearly every shot but he receives the support of some excellent casting choices including Cate Blanchett , who took home an Oscar for the performance and the highly underutilized Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly. The editing of their work under can be choppy at times particularly in the beginning where titles describing the action and timeframe become necessary to keep things straight. However, once the film settles into more linear storytelling and its focus on Hughes' romance of Katharine Hepburn the nearly three hour run time moves as smoothly and quickly as one of Hughes' more successful aircraft designs. In short, the excellence of 'The Aviator' and the genius and psychosis of its subject invite a sequel from Scorsese.",7,1,2,6 December 2011
American Psycho," Ambiguity doesn't equal cleverness
","American Psycho stars a Brit and is filmed largely in Toronto with much of the music provided by Englishmen (exclude for Huey Lewis who's golden retriever countenance and cheerfulness couldn't be much more American). Title aside the film based on the overrated novel plays out the idle fantasies of an unseen office-dwelling narrator named Patrick Bateman who imagines himself really, really, really, really, ridiculously good looking (as Derek Zoolander might say), wealthy without actually having to do any work, and with his greatest challenge securing reservations at popular NYC restaurants of the time. He also fantasizes about extreme sex and violence scenarios recording them in a notebook in his office. The book and movie try to leave this ambiguous mistaking having a definite ending for cleverness. Of course, others have their own interpretation of events but ultimately the movie is not sufficiently interesting to argue about. While it does handily provide an critique of 80's yuppie culture, that wealthy entitled lifestyle has always existed in prosperous Western cultures; in the 80's it just had a name. In short, for as much ink and outrage spilled about the film, you would think it would actually be more thought-provoking.",4,0,2,1 September 2015
Knowing," 10 pounds of movie in a 5 pound bag
","'Knowing' presents a little more than the average matinée audience member bargained for when they arrived for 'Deep Impact', '2012', 'Armageddon', 'The Day After Tomorrow', etc. action. Is the universe deterministic or random, can a prediction be thwarted and still be called correct, what if you knew what was going to happen and no one believed you? Writers Ryne Douglas Pearson and Juliet Snowden jam these and more question into the story of an MIT scientist and the numeric code that conveniently falls into his hands. If the writers have an ambitious agenda they are slackers compared to Alex Proyas who throws in one thematic element after another. Beyond the mystery of the code and its predictions and Nick Cage's character's grief over his deceased wife and subsequent alcoholism, there are aliens and maybe ghosts and government agents and a whole lot of whispering. Eventually the subplots and complicated mythos overwhelm the plot into something harder to follow than the old sci-fi film version of 'Dune'. Cage, who is far more at home as a the disturbed genius character than all of the action figure jobs he consistently lands does his best in their subplot soup but gets little support for a most forgettable support cast. In short, fans of watching stuff get blowed up really good get their money's worth but others should look elsewhere.",Null,0,1,25 August 2011
Hugo," Best Picture Bait
","Martin Scorsese would like to preemptively thank the Academy for what will likely be at least four nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), and Best Supporting Actress (Helen McCrory). Given most of the movie serves as a celebration of movie-making as an art and movie directors as artists, they don't have much choice. Also it gives the Academy a chance to dole out a lifetime achievement award to Scorsese and Kingsley (although he has done a fair bit of schlock such as 'Species'). Wrapped around the brief history of the earliest beginnings of movie-making and the self-reverential celebration of film-making is the plot from the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret'. In this story, an orphan subsists in the Paris train station by stealing and spends most of his time running from the station's dedicated constable. Somehow we are lead to believe this is preferable to be sent to the local orphanage. In an interesting casting move lunatic Sasha Baron Cohen plays the socially awkward policeman. Unlike most prior roles we don't see him naked but we are invited to laugh at a physical deformity resulting from an injury sustained in World War II so he does retain some of his trademark offense. While the casting decision mixed things up in what is a very staid and stately film, Cohen's maniacal vibe is largely wasted here and the part could have been played by any number of actors. Certainly a gorgeous film and a good use of 3-D; however, even here the 3-D medium feels gimmicky. Scorsese swings for the fences with the technology and it is its breadth and Merchant Ivory grand, sweeping feel that leads to some of the problems with the movie. The chief among these lies with the slow, stately pacing which is simply dull in a number of particularly slow spots. The intrusive soundtrack often offers some bouncing bit of orchestral shenanigans during these times when not much is happening on the screen further highlighting the yawn-worthy scenes. A second major problem comes from a jarring break between the main Hugo plot and the academic salute to movie-making which starts about three-fifths into the film. By the time the history lesson ends, the return to the Hugo's battle against Cohen almost could use a recap for those who had forgotten the earlier story. In short, not a great film but with too many of the elements needed to a Best Picture nom and probably win unless the Weinsteins come up with another historical period drama.",6,3,6,27 November 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Frat boy humor in a high-concept package
","Some interesting decisions here from Judd Apatow and company. They start with just the essential choice to parody a modestly well-know music biography - 'Walk the Line' which had come out only 2 years prior. Unlike 'Spaceballs', the Mel Brooks parody of perhaps the most famous films of all time and one rife for satire likely the vast majority of film-goers won't even catch most of the allusions to Johnny Cash's story such as the death of his brother who haunted him his whole life. Also, Cash's name continues to carry artistic cache unlike a John Denver or even Elvis Presley so some viewers may have found themselves offended by the send-up of Cash's life story. Another interesting choice involves using a script made up of only jokes until the final 10-15 minutes of run-time when the film becomes very sentimental finishing on an incongrously uplifting final performance of a legitimate tune. The strategy seemed to be to launch one joke after another with the idea that enough will land to make the overall experience funny. While there is some sophisticated humor (Dewey's first wife played by Kristen Wiig promises to support his muscial career no matter what before nearly instantly trying to get a legitimate job for him in a slaughterhouse even after he has become wildly sucessful), for the most part - including the actual name of the film - it is a long series of racial, scatalogical, and genital jokes. There are many Python-esque absurdist moments as well particularly focused on fourth-wall breaking (much is made of John C. Reily playing Dewey at 14, 19, and 21). In short, probrably more of a party movie for groups enjoying some inerbriates.",5,0,1,21 February 2018
Divergent," A little worse than the source material would have suggested
","The book upon which the film is based would suggest the film version should have been been a little above average but yet Neil Burger turns in a little below average adaptation. The main culprit springs out of an uninspired cast nearly top to bottom. Lead Shailene Woodley deeps lacks the Jennifer Lawrence's big screen charisma and the viewer's eye frequently loses attention on what she's saying in favor of some interesting CGI work on post-apocalyptic Chicago. English thespian Theo James has the gravitas of someone in their early thirties which ramps up the ick factor when you dwell on the problematic plot point of a male teacher starting a romance with his 16 year old female charge. Most of the rest of the cast is indistinguishable although some of that is a side effect of the book which struggled to distinguish the male characters. Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet could have easily swapped parts between the criminally under-used mother character and the villain with the least evil name ever - Jeanine without any diminishment. The boring cast does play the plot close to the book although the necessarily condensing accelerates as the movie goes on until an ending that is just a quick greatest hits of the last dozen chapters of the book. In short, given a mediocre Hunger Games and Harry Potter band wagon jumper as the source material this wasn't going to be great but it could have been much better.",4,1,2,2 February 2016
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," You were expecting Moliere?
","Didn't you always wonder what became of Hansel & Gretel after the witch killing covered by the fairy tale? No? OK, but wouldn't it be cool to take that fairy tale and marry it with a Stallone/schwarzenegger 80's action movie? No? OK, just shut off your frontal cortex and stare at the clearly demarcated good / bad guys and the inventive period sets and watch the action. With a name like 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' you get what you pay for, a short, self-conscious, action movie which doesn't worry about placing girls with machine guns in a medieval story without electric lights. Penicillin hasn't been discovered but insulin has luckily in time to save the likable and watchable Jeremy Renner. Only somewhat hiding his disdainful amusement for the proceedings Renner's Hansel drinks and carouses his way along with the innocuous Gemma Arteon who looks good against pretty nice sets for a moderately budgeted film. That budget paid for digital efforts better rendered than some films with 3 times the budget and the fights (and basically this is just a string of hunter vs witch battle royales) are clearly choreographed and follow-able. In short, 'H&S: WH' doesn't rise above dumb entertainment but it doesn't disappoint either.",5,0,1,18 November 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Well-executed particularly given some tough source material
","David Fincher of the brilliant 'Fight Club' is to be congratulated in his success in translating Steig Larsson's smartypants, hyper-violent, dank steampunk novel into an entertaining movie. One wishes Ron 'Opie' Howard could have shown the same skill in his dismal filming of the Dan Brown's 'The Da Vinci Code'. Fincher does not shy away from presenting the convoluted, vicious story of intrigue in the very foreign country of Sweden as written. This trust in the material, which Howard did not show, reveals an acceptance of the fact that this story was inexplicably popular among book clubbing housewives. Fincher presses the accelerated right from the beginning and does not let up through the entire 2 and 1/2 hour run-time risking losing viewers as the twists of the mystery unfold. Although tough to follow and often tough to watch the intriguing story winds up like a really good episode of 'The X-Files'. Also to be congratulated is the Academy of Arts and Sciences who recognized that newcomer Rooney, quite literately, put her all into what is ultimately an unpleasant and unattractive character. It was a nomination and maybe even an award that was well-deserved. Daniel Craig, who need to carry the film given the constraints of the largely non-verbal Salandar character, makes for a passable Blumquist. Stockholm native Stellan Skarsgard excels portraying a mixture of bourgeoisie charm and generational psychopathy. In short, it's a tough sit but a rewarding one.",7,1,5,12 April 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Funny, if you ignore the tax implications.
","'The Men Who Stare at Goats' starts off with the great warning that you don't want to know how many of the stories are true; this is particularly true if you have paid U.S. taxes during the past 40 years. The movie dramatizes actual U.S. military programs including one that spanned several decades and consumed tens of millions of taxpayer money after the Cold War military was conned into believing that our Soviet opponents were developing 'psychic' powers. It also covers stories of U.S. paid military contractors who wound up shooting at each other again a dramatization but based on real and embarrassing events. The deliciousness of these tales is the movie's strength but also its weakness as the throwaway plot that is woven around them about Ewan McGregor's jilted newspaper reporter trying to impress this ex-wife by traveling to the Iraqi war zone feels very tacked on. Speaking of McGregor, he shares the screen with what may be the most impressive current male cast possible; props to the casting agent who secured Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney each of whom would have been a monster 'get' for any movie. Ultimately however, once the stories of the military's foray in new age nonsense and imperialism-on-the-cheap of the Iraqi invasion are told there is not a terribly lot for them to do. Still it is hard to not recommend a movie with a cast this stellar - it might just be worth it to see Jeff Bridges jaw-dropping aging from an energetic hippie general to alcoholic shadow of his former self.",5,0,4,5 December 2011
The Lego Movie," Inventive as plastic blocks in the hands of a hyperactive 4 yr old
","This 90 minute infomercial for the iconic children's toy presents about 20 minutes of clever but plodding world-building. At about that mark, the filmmakers find this whole other hyperactive gear and the jokes come faster than Vin Diesel in a street race. Enough Batman and Star Wars references fly at the audience to give a geek study group fodder for several nights. The movie runs through genres as often as Lego worlds ('Middle Zealand' being a personal favorite) while teeing up cliché- bursting one-liners as rapidly as audience members can laugh at them. Just at the point of exhaustion, they trout out Will Farrell to play a weirdly-obsessed dad outside the fourth wall. That the writers can take all the plot points, the subplots and the meta-plot and wrap it up into what actually turns out to be a warm and somehow affecting ending speaks to the level of prowess missing from the 'Lost' TV show. In short, one of the few movies actually worth buying as well as best commercial ever.",8,0,1,1 July 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Given what they spent, likely felt compelled the additional dull 45 minutes
","When Ant Man gets really big, shouldn't have become just a bigger easy target given he has no real powers? And when will there be a giant Ant Man vs. Godzilla movie? Come on Hollywood get it together! Anywho, this over-earnest summer popcorn movie comes out under the banner of Captain America played by the charisma-free but purdy Chris Evans but secretly and wisely treats RDJ's Tony Stark as the main attraction. A boatload of other characters clog the film many becoming forgettable during actual scenes (oh yeah, Bucky the Winter Soldier IS still in this shot). The film also makes the George Lucas second Star Wars series of spending too much time listening to politicians argue about characters who could be performing some action scene. Not that the movie lacks for action, it just comes in prolonged, interminable sequences particularly an ending fight between 'Cap' and Ironman (oh, yeah and Bucky, he was in much of that scene) which goes on longer than The Thrilla in Manilla and yet doesn't resolve much. The movie does provide more Easter eggs than your Aunt Sally's for her annual egg hunt which will give you something to do rather than listen to the rebellious, free-thinking maverick Tony Stark incongruously argue for United Nations oversight. In short, yeah, you know it's not any of the Fantastic Four movies but not quite the first Ironman.",5,3,6,12 January 2017
Spirited Away," Miyazaki's Classic
","We caught the next in the continuing series of Hayao Miyazaki?s animated children?s movies playing at our town theater this weekend. ?Spirited Away? is considered his masterwork and features his classic themes including environmentalism, a plucky young girl, witches and other magical creatures and the consequences of an older generation?s greed. Unlike other of his films there is no backdrop of war in a fanciful land but rather a move to the suburbs by an ordinary family. Chihiro, who is renamed Sen by the evil witch Yubaba, must face the mostly hideous other-worldly creatures of what appears to the outside world as an abandoned amusement park in her quest to return her parents to their original species. She is befriended by the Miyazaki?s compulsory flawed but brilliant wizard, in this case called Haku. Unlike his other films, there is a non-magical (muggle?) female lead called Lin who also aids Chihiro. As usual the animation is amazing and is made frightening by surrealistically outsized facial features on the evil Yubaba and her ridiculously sized baby. Conversely, the six-armed boiler-tender called Kamajii is disturbing because of a fluidity of his movements which give the impression that we might be OK to go ahead an evolve a few more limbs. Most impressive is a train which travels through the lonely, flooded plains which surround the bathhouse and the other station stops. The train is peopled by ghostly passengers rendered as dark silhouettes who slowly depart until only Chihiro and her small party of creatures remain. This sequence is the most truly dream-like I?m seen on film. Chihiro eventually rescues her parents and reclaims her name by rejecting conventional reactions to seemingly evil characters and understanding what is causing them to behave the way they do. In one sequence she removes a literal gigantic tangle of junk from a river spirit which all the rest of the cast avoids due to his smell. In another, she rejects the gold gobbled up by the rest of the cast when offered by a character called ?No-Face.? After No-Face goes berserk and his gold turns out to be an illusion she lures him out of the bathhouse because she understands that the greed of the staff is causing him to tear the place apart. Finally, when Haku returns dying and in dragon form from Yubaba?s twin sister, Chihiro pulls out of him the golden seal he stole which is killing him. ?Spirited Away? received a 94 on Metacritic putting it 11th all time. It was also, apparently, the biggest money making in Japanese film history. I?m not sure I would rank it quite that high but it does an amazing job of relating its story of environmentalism, pacifism, and understanding through pictures that transcend the language barrier.",8,1,2,5 December 2011
Tropic Thunder," Best comedy of the 'naughts'
","'Tropic Thunder' is the best movie of 2008 with the exception of Wall-E. Although the criticism that it slows down following the initial setup of the premise is valid, the jokes become a lot more subtle. Ben Stiller does a great send-up of Tom Cruise and Cruise himself does a hilarious setup of studio bosses. Jack Black's heroin-fueled comedian-trying-to-do-legitimate-acting-work is a bit one-note. As always the weakest part of the film is Matthew McConaughey who is just awful. The best part of the film is watching Robert Downey, jr. go all-in betting his recently resuscitated career on a very controversial character. HI-larious.",9,5,10,5 December 2011
Inside Out," Pretty good on the Pixar scale
","Featuring a clever conceit and the standard glorious Pixar animation, 'inside Out' fails to fail like 'Cars 2' or 'Brave' but doesn't become an instant classic like 'Monsters University' or 'Wall-E.' As usual the world-building -in this case the internal monolouge of an eleven- year old girl - yields an immersive and discuss-able experience. It falls somewhat short of, say, 'The Incredibles' when it comes to snappy dialog or repeatable lines. The fact that line where the character Sadness is told to 'be positive' and responds with 'I'm positive we're going to get lost' actually makes the trailer gives you a sense of the weakness of the script. The voice-acting and cast choices are solid if not bold - see Lewis Black as 'Anger'. In short, well worth seeing although you could wait until it shows up on streaming video.",7,3,22,7 July 2015
The Duchess," Being a princess not all it is cracked up to be
","I saw The Duchess on Saturday night, the latest English period piece (this time late 18th century) starring Kiera Knightly as a woman in a bad relationship. This time she is Georgiana, a slender, attractive, fashionable, emotional woman who is all but sold to the Duke of Devonshire, played as an ice-cold, aging, brute by Ralph (he would like you to call him 'Rafe') Fiennes. The Duke of Love he is not, at one point he defends his disinterest, his rampant infidelity and his abuse of the power of his birthright by saying: 'I love you in the way I understand love.' As he understands it, the intent of marriage is nearly exclusive to produce a male heir which Georgiana fails to do on numerous tries. While he is waiting, he produces an illegitimate daughter and invites another woman to comes to live in the palace and attend social functions with the two of them. Georgiana takes solace in the future prime minister Charles Grey. They produce Eliza, whom she must give up or lose the children she has with the Duke. Georgiana eventually lives out her life quietly and is officially replaced as wife after her death. The movie is interesting largely because the relationship bears such a striking resemblance to the Prince Charles / Lady Diana Spencer (who is a descendant of one of the characters) / Camilla Parker Bowles affair. Diana/Georgiana are fashion icons both beloved by the nation ('the only one not in love with Georgiana is the Duke' as one character describes the common wisdom). Charles / Duke are both dull (in most ways that word can be defined), plodding remnants of a once powerful royalty who would have risen to not a quantum of the power they possessed if left to their own devices. Of course, modern divorce laws and the continued marginalization of the monarchy meant that Diana would not share Georgiana's fate. The movie, and to some extent the modern story, put the lie to Disney's princess stories my girl's favor and suggest that Prince William may not be dreamy as you might think.",4,3,4,5 December 2011
District 9," Visually stunning by-the-numbers science-fiction-as-social-commentary.
","District 9 is very much in the tradition of what kept Star Trek from being an obscure, short-lived sixties television series ? discussing incendiary social issues in the context of fantastical alien stories. Here space aliens stranded on earth are saddled with derogatory nicknames, penned onto scrub land and harassed by the government. It could also be the story of native Americans, Palestinians, Eastern Europeans during World War II, Australian aborigines among many, many others. Given the South African setting the most specific reference is to Apartheid and the film must have particular emotional resonance in that country as well as many others on the African continent subjected to colonialism. Beyond being a technical marvel (somehow the movies solves the common problem of real actors not appearing to actually be looking at the CGI creatures when they share scenes) the film captures the techniques of oppression with great fidelity. The government?s representative trying to move the aliens, Wikus, from their squalid encampment to something more like a concentration camp (as he later admits) provides a running narrative for the press explaining what may seem like oppression and harassment is really in their best interests. He uses the threat of taking away their children to gain their compliance in the context of ?only doing what is best for the children?. Inevitably, Wikus is infected with alien genetic material and begins a transformation so that he can eventually come to understand things from their perspective. Here the visuals become less impressive as Wikus follows the physical transform patter of the original ?The Fly? (one arms turns alien first) and the remake of ?The Fly? (his fingernails start to fall off and he starts eating unpleasant things). As you realize from early in the film he winds up finding on the alien?s side. This predictable story line (shared by Disney?s ?Pocahontas?, James Cameron?s ?Avatar?, Kevin Costner?s ?Dances With Wolves? among many others) is one of the film?s weaker points as is a lack of characters that we can care about (the only sympathetic characters are aliens who are too, well, alien, to gain much audience sympathy). See it for the movie-making skill but not so much for the story.",6,1,3,5 December 2011
Wreck-It Ralph," Like Pixar used to make
","Back in the day Pixar would put together culturally-aware, well-written animated fare for children and the parents who had to take them to the movie theater. While 'Wreck-It Ralph' is no 'Wall-E' or 'Monsters, Inc', it is a smart, fun little romp through the annals of video gaming history. John C. Reilly nails the titular role by essentially playing it as the anti-Robin Williams. His even keeled, thoughtful, world-weary, voice work brings a deserved respite from the rapid-fire, jump-cut work of the animated videogames that serve as the film's locations. Rather than the over-the-top scene chewing, you would get from most other voice actors, Reilly delivers a believable relationship arc with Sarah Silverman's video game racing little girl. This warmth carries the film through some slow spots and obvious points where the writers have to wait for something to happen or where they have to write themselves out of corners (wait, so characters who are a product of programming code can change programming code?). Television actors Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch are cast to type and log decent costarring performances. The animation they inhabit is very inventive and smartly emulates thirty years of computational improvements from Fix-It Felix's Donkey Kong clone to the latest Halo-esque first person shooter. However, even non-gamers will find smart references and good performances worth seeing. In short, definitely one to add to your must-see animation list and hopefully one John Lassiter and the boys at Pixar saw.",7,0,0,1 April 2013
Bridesmaids," Comedy heavy on the drama
","The most surprising thing about this supposedly female version of 'The Hangover' (and 'The Hangover II' which was apparently the same movie) is how much it is not a female version of 'The Hangover'. While to some degree a raunchy comedy, the movie deals more with the complexities of female relationship and dealing with personal failure in life more similar to Alexander Payne's 'Sideways'. The movie take a long, well- informed look at the waning process of longstanding female relationships as well as female rivalry. The rivalry between Wiig's Annie Walker and a far more successful suitor for her best friend since grade school Lilian (Maya Rudolph)is the better developed with very funny scenes of one-ups- manship (or one-ups-womanship). Annie's coming-apart-at-the-seams development after she loses first a bakery business, boyfriend and eventually her best friend is also interesting to watch. You cannot blame Lilian's or Chris O'Dowd's character turning their back on her as her behavior gets more and more erratic. While the strong plot carries the movie, there are some very distracting problems. Wisconsin looks nothing like Southern California where a lot of it was shot. State policemen act nothing like Officer Rhodes and would quickly get fired if they did. Melissa MacCarthny's Megan, which got her an academy nom largely to make the group seem less stuffy, makes no sense. Is she supposed to be the Zach Galifianakis screw-up from 'The Hangover' or the international spy we hear about towards the end of the film. Wendy McLendon-Covey's Rita is an interesting character given that she foreshadows the miserable life that Maya's character (who seems a little old to be getting married for the first time) is destined for later down the road. The film does have some surprisingly darker moments before the obligatory ending dance number. In short, more substance here than you have been lead to believe although there are some genuinely funny moments.",6,0,3,1 March 2012
The Princess Bride," Genuine classic.
","'This is Spinal Tap', 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'The Princess Bride' give director Rob Reiner a trio of timeless classics. 'Princess Bride' takes the classic boy-meets-girl setup and adds 'Wizard of Oz'-level lines such as 'life is pain, anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something' and 'you keep saying that word (inconceivable)-I do not think it means what you think it means.' He also adds a flawless cast including the under-appreciated Mandy Patinkin, a shockingly menacing portrayal from the normally silly Christopher Guest and the previously unusable Andre' the Giant who is somehow made to deliver an understandable and winning performance. By the turns the movie is funny, frightening, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful and whimsical. The framing device with Peter Falk and Fred Savage allows Reiner to step out when things become too intense and makes this watchable even for the younger set. In short, add this to your must see list especially if you have children.",8,2,3,6 December 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Why isn't Alan Tudyk a bigger star?
","The central conceit - that the creepy hillbillies are actually the victims and the expendable college student the predators - is clever although it only carries the film so far. The true attraction here grows out of the interactions of the titular characters. Watching their friendly banter, their expression of feelings and the caring big brother / little brother dynamic makes for a compelling buddy comedy. The inclusion of, fortunately mostly cartoonish, gore does kind of reduce the warmth of the piece but it was necessary for the plot. While both Tucker and Dale benefit from excellent characterizations, Alan Tudyk shines in his role as a viewer surrogate much like the characters Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks played in their heydays. In short, there's a little too much slashy-slashy and stuff blowing up but ultimately the well-written and acted bromance elements are well worth watching",7,0,1,8 December 2017
Frozen," Disney returns to form
","'The Snow Queen' - the title 'Frozen' was just something some idiot marketing VP thought would sell more tickets - stands as a very good and arguably great return to form by Disney. This smart retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen classic mixes a few bold musical choices along with some hum-able pop climaxing with 'Let It Go' which also accompanies the closing credits. Although computer generated, the animation nonetheless comes off as warm (pun intended) and not computer-y sans for the eyes of the two main sister characters which are a bit doll-like. The 'Let it Go' sequence allows the computer animators to rare-back and show off how their technical virtuosity. The small-name cast means the characters shine through - imagine Robin Williams hamming it up and making a mess of Olaf the enchanted snowman character instead of the engaging job by Josh Gad. This reserve permeate the project and lends something of an air of the classic it may potentially grow into. In short, Disney, good to have you back.",8,2,4,2 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," The movie equivalent of a quality at-bat
","Stiller's film adaptation of the middle school staple Thurber story is one of those movies where you leave fully understanding where he was going with it. His quirky intense weirdness that worked so well in 'Zoolander' and 'Tropic Thunder' comes off more off-putting here more similar to 'Dodgeball' or 'The Cable Guy'. Stiller's Mitty takes his dying job of physical photographic negative wrangler super-intensely and he is prepared to go down with the sinking 'Life Magazine' ship. In a great piece of casting, Sean Penn plays his superstar photographer benefactor. Penn is supposed to be the catalyst to draw Mitty out of his dreaming and into some doing. However, we never really doubt Mitty will make the leap so the dramatic tension is low. We also know Life Magazine eventually went out of print so no surprises there. The nostalgia that permeates the writing and the message that life should be lived in the real life rather than on-line as a silicon chip and copper wire extension of human imagination are good but not particularly powerfully conveyed. Also, the run-time could have be shaved back to create a tighter narrative. In short, nicely done but not powerfully so.",5,0,1,1 July 2014
Ghostbusters," Wears surprisingly well.
","Meant as a popcorn comedy feature better than 25 years ago when it debuted, the Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd written tale holds up almost shockingly well despite its age. This partially due to Bill Murray's smarmy, sneering, cynic character which also makes comedies such as 'Stripes' and 'Groundhog Day' equally re-watchable. It is also due to how Reitman captures NYC's bad ol' days of crime, grit and lawlessness before Disney conquered Times Square. New York in those days was the most likely spawning group of supernatural evil and adding ghosts to the rats, and roaches seemed like an easy fit. The movie also still works because it was fairly edgy with Murray's Venkman torturing one of his male college students in an attempt to bed a female student (Jennifer Runyon was well worth the academic censure). Later he shows up for a date with Sigourney Weaver's Dana Barrett apparently with Thorazine in tow which he uses to sedate the possessed cellist he finds (if she wasn't possessed, what was he planning to do with it?) There is talk of the existence of god, a marshmallow man burns to death and the famous line 'yes, this man has no dick' is uttered. Although awkward when viewed with younger DVD-watchers, the film's spice keeps it fresh even after a quarter century on the shelf. Definitely a very good choice for as a Halloween rental.",8,0,0,6 December 2011
The Hurt Locker," A movie-making accomplishment but more immersive than compelling.
","'The Hurt Locker' may take the Best Movie Oscar but it will be more for being a well-made simulacrum of the murderous tension of disarming ?IEDs? in a hostile combat situation rather than for the riveting series of plot development. Following the reckless anti-hero William James, played with a convincing dead-behind-the-eyes zealotry by Jeremy Renner, into a series of bomb disarming and other combat scenarios makes initially for engrossing viewing. However, after you accept that he isn?t wildly concerned if he, or his fellow soldiers, get killed they do tend to be less riveting as the film goes on. The remainder of the plot largely deals with his unreasonable need to avenge an Iraqi street kids who he knows only briefly. All-in-all a well made film but not somewhat overrated.",6,1,3,5 December 2011
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Dodge of superhero movies
","Perhaps the dopiest supervillain or superhero depending on the point in the film in the Marvel universe is the ridiculous Silver Surfer. Literally he's a spaceman on a surfboard. One imagines Stan Lee struggling with a looming deadline ahead of a beach vacation and just rolling with whatever the first idea that came to mind. Given a whole movie around this loser concept, the film had an institutional upper limit on quality. Not that it worked hard to overcome the Silver Surfer handicap. The film growns under the weight of extensive product placement for some reason mostly around mediocre products most notably Dodge motor cars (one imagines the Fantastic Four quickly tired of going to the dealer to solve minor quality hiccups with their Dodge Fantasticar). It also struggles with Chris Evans and Michael Chilkris clearly feeling upstaged by their more talented, attractive and necessary members of the foursome so much so they spend a distracting amount of the movie breaking the fourth wall. While o plot, characters, acting and advertising all come in sub optimal, it would be remiss to not notice the smaller, inferior details. Why did Costume Design just recycle the one-piece blue and black unitards from 'Stark Treak Next Generation'. More importantly, did women have to take the whole thing off in order to pee? The Silver Surfer most remains unresponsive to the hero's questions but he does answer some queries particularly around his romantic interest back home. Does he just not understand the heroes or is it that he finds their dialog not worth of responding to much like most of the audience feels about the script? The film poses many questions, the most of important of which is whether you can get some of your ticket price back. In short, keep in mind that Marvel produces so many superheroes that most won't be that good.",3,0,2,24 November 2015
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Not Miyazaki's best but still very good
","Today, I took the kids out to see 'Kaze no tani no Naushika' or 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/), an animated movie from Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki. Miyazaki created a series of extremely popular animated films in Japan which have slowly made the trip to art theaters in the U.S. His films all feature themes of environmentalism and post Armageddon human survival which flow directly out of his experience in post-Hiroshima Japan. The films also feature a plucky young heroine who faces trails but manages to ultimately save the day due to her connection and love of nature. My personal theory is that the heroine represents Japan itself which Miyazaki believes must find a way to live in harmony with nature or perish.The themes in ?Nausicaa? are classic Miyazaki, our Princess protagonist is both warrior and pacifist. She is also an environmentalist so fervent that she actually hugs a tree during a scene when discovers that nature is slowly ridding itself of pollution by filtering them through petrified trees which underlie a poisonous jungle. Her kingdom (the Valley of the Wind from the English title) is caught in the cross-fire of two tribes. It is further menaced by ?Ohms? or armored, articulated cockroach-like roughly the size of Greyhound bus. The other insects in her world are also super-sized, products of a 7-day incineration of the earth inflicted by giants created by man as weapons of war. One of the warring tribes, the Tolmekian, is trying to resurrect on of the giants to use against Ohms, the residents of the Valley of the Wind and whoever else gets in her way.Can Princess Nausicaa save her beloved valley by pacifying the Oms and by bringing peace between the warring kingdoms? Can she raise the conscientious of her people and of the warring tribes to the fact that that humankind can only survive by living in harmony with nature? Does Miyazaki recycle aluminum cans? Of course, it is ultimately a children?s movie and one with a message of being green that long preceded its adoption in the U.S.",6,0,4,5 December 2011
Hidden Figures," Only 3 Oscar Noms?
","An intelligent and well executed look back at a far more racially divided but also a far more ambitious U.S. Congrats to Hollywood for putting aside a small percentage of a what was probably another Spiderman reboot or Transformers sequel to actually tell an original story worthy of being filmed. Thewestchestarian understands this was likely an aberration and that we'll get a $250M Suicide Squad remake for summer 2018 so let's enjoy it while we can. The film features three excellent portrayals of separate but unequal NASA employees trying to contribute their full talents for a nation that treats them pretty shabbily. Also, Kevin Costner puts in an Oscar-worthy performance as a NASA director under enough pressure from the Ruskies to take steps toward providing a more even playing field among the math geniuses under his charge. Apart from an overdone scene where Costner take a crowbar to a sign segregating the women's bathrooms, his character only changes as much as he needs to as shown in scenes when he refers to the now gender and racial integrated group as 'gentlemen'. The movie has some flaws. Katherine G. Johnson's character has 3 children who show up about twice - one is left to wonder how Katherine's long nights at Langley affected them. They movie also succumbs to the Hollywood superstar problem when telling a team story - one that Apollo 13 successfully avoided. Johnson's character is portrayed as the lone person who knows what they are doing while Jim Parsons' character does nothing else but take credit for her work. At one point Costner's character inspires them by pointing out he has assembled the best math geniuses in the country so presumably Parsons' Paul Stafford was making something of a contribution. In short, ultimately, this film is inspirational on several fronts and is the right one for the times and is way better than La La Land.",8,6,16,24 January 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," A tepid dish
","Apply the incredible advances in three dimensional CGI rendering to a pretty good children?s book and you get?a pretty good movie. CwCM takes the central idea of the kid?s book and tries to inflate it to a full-length feature film by using anti-obesity, pro-environment and worldwide Armageddon themes. The heavy themes and the cacophonous Foley editing quickly becomes a bit much leading to some relief when its 90 minute running time has evaporated. However, like food avalanche that destroys the town/island somewhere in the mess are some tasty nuggets including Mr. T?s voice-over work (although his lines are fairly repetitive) and some clever food-themed riffs. The noise and the funny will help to distract from some truly WTF moments including a cameraman turns out to be a Guatemalan doctor, a former child star who later turns into a cooked chicken and the giant squid-sized eyes on the main characters (I understand that bigger eyes = more cute but only to a certain extent before it become creepy). In summary, wait for it on cable.",4,1,4,5 December 2011
Lincoln," A prestige production makes this the Best Picture favorite
","Spielberg assembles a top quality cast into a first class production dramatizing a key historical moment in U.S. history to create a first- class production that is the Oscar Best Picture film to beat. Oscar noms should also be plentiful among the cast most obviously for Daniel Day Lewis who demonstrates his absolute mastery early on in the film. As the title character, Lewis relates a story in Lincoln slow Midwestern cadence in order to argue a point of law and the audience finds itself identifying and agreeing with point as audiences of Lincoln era would have been swayed by the actual 16th President. James Spader may also see a Best Supporting Nom with a lively portrayal of a fixer called Bilbo whose nefarious activities help to secure the passage of the 13th amendment. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field contribute gravitas to the proceedings if not actual standout performances. The writing may also pull a few nominations as the 2 1/2 hour running time slides by quickly due nearly entirely to genuine eloquence in the script. Spielberg's cinematography yields history textbook moments particularly of Lincoln horseback reviewing the Civil War battlefields. In short, Lincoln clearly seizes the title of this year's 'The King's Speech.'",8,1,2,28 December 2012
Big Hero 6," Smart, clever and more fun than a big, huggable robot
","'Big Hero 6' delivers on its very specific promise of being a somewhat comedic (although the family member death toll is quite high), loud, kinetic action-adventure film. The fun mostly comes from its 'Real Genius' or 'Revenge of the Nerds' hyperactive brainiac superheroes reacting against 'The Dude'-like 'Baymax' played by Scott Adsit (of '30 Rock' fame). His Spock-ian rationality and calm acts as the perfect comic foil against which to contrast collapsing buildings, dastardly Steve Jobs-modeled villains and very implausible technology weapons (wouldn't have telepathic controls been way more than enough to win the science fair without needing the cooperative robots?). Baymax charms more than any of the human characters all of whom are polite and with a heart of gold other than the juvenilely named 'Go-Go'. The characters are winning than the plot which pulls its punches in the same way 'Star Trek Into Darkness' does by given the bad guy a good reason for his evil actions (in both cases to same their families). Takes some of the sting of the revenge fantasy angle. Beyond the standard Disney killing off of the mother, the movie goes a little overboard by taking out other family members as well - thought this was a kid's popcorn flick screenwriters? However, lots of Easter eggs, nicely- paced action and some clever dialog make you forget about the plot weaknesses. In short, while you won't remember the film by the time the inevitable sequel rolls out, you'll retain a vague sense of having been entertained.",7,1,16,19 November 2014
Brave," Strike 2.
","After the panned 'Cars 2', Pixar hoped to get back on base with the 6- year-in-the-making 'Brave' - unfortunately it will have to wait for the next pitch. Certainly, not a bad film but one that relies less on the visual fireworks 'Wall-E' or crackling inside jokes ('Monsters, Inc) of previous Pixar films and more on sheer plot. Unfortunately, the plot they choose centers around feminist empowerment that would have felt dated had the premiere been in 1983. In fact, the writer Brenda Chapman wholesale lifted the plot from Marlo Thomas' 1972 record album 'Free to be You and Me' padding it with some magical elements later on in the film. Unfortunately, the characters don't step in and save the plot. The royal family including Merida are types more than characters, the triplets are more background than characters, and the bad guys are all menace and hair. And what's with the love/hate relationship movie-goers have with bears anyway? For every Yogi, there's a 'The Edge' - if the film doesn't teach us tolerance for girls, at least it might help out acceptance of bears. In short, re-rent 'Wall-E' the height of what might just turn out to be Pixar's bygone glory days.",Null,1,4,13 July 2012
Hotel Transylvania," Bloodless and toothless kiddie faire
","With its plot lifted shamelessly from 'Finding Nemo' and its overly familiar standard Halloween-mask characters, the basics of 'Hotel Transylvania' pose no threat to the younger set and no challenge for anyone older. Dialog and plot development match the toothless motif with a big, friendly daddy Dracula defends his monsters-only hotel a la John Cleese in the old British 'Fawlty Towers' television show (or 'programme') and tries to keep his daughter from coming of age. The main plot follows precisely the sequence you expect from this premise with the characters growing and coming to terms right on cue. The big name voice actors (Sandler, Samberg, Gomez, etc.) appropriately phone it in given a lack of interesting dialog or witty one-liners. The animation style brings us a lot of warm colors but no technical virtuosity. In short, a non-offensive essential neutral time killer for the five to ten year old set.",5,3,7,19 October 2012
The Dark Knight," A well done version of very well worn characters
","hate to go all 'emperor-has-no-clothesâ? here but I'm not understanding how this is regarded as one of the best movies of 2008. It is certainly a good movie â' the 2 Â½ hour running time goes by imperceptibly due to the steady, rapid pace. The special effects are remarkable particularly the 'Two-Faceâ? CGI on Aaron Eckhart. Obviously, the cast features three generations of greater actors (including the tragically deceased Heath Ledger). I guess my issues are largely around the plot. Batman (be it Christian Bale, George Clooney or Michael Keaton) is just not an endearing enough character for me to really care whether he defeats The Joker or not. Also, how does The Joker recruit henchmen when he kills them all at the end of his capers? Don't henchman talk? Or at least notice when their numbers start to dwindle? Also maybe I missed it but Two-Face knew The Joker was ultimately behind the killing of Rachel Dawes, why did he effectively join up with him near the end of the movie? I guess this movie will be like 'No Country for Old Menâ? was for me last year, I didn't understand why people loved that thing either.",6,0,2,5 December 2011
Into the Wild," A fascinating true story
","An interesting told pretty well told by Oscar winner Sean Penn. At some point in their life all men have the fantasy of just dropping out of society and living off the (hopefully) fat of the land. This movie is about a middle class suburban college student who actually did it. He eventually painfully starves to death alone in a bus inexplicably abandoned in the remote Alaskan wilderness so it is a bit of bummer. However, the two and half hours that lead up to his final stand are a fascinating study of someone who has either the courage or craziness to attempt what 100% of people fantasize about doing but 99.9% would not. In short, pick the right material as a filmmaker and the job almost does itself.",7,0,0,5 December 2011
Avatar," A technical wonder built on recycled components.
","A technical wonder built on recycled components. Like its Oscar competitors 'District 9' and 'The Hurt Locker', James Cameron's 'Avatar' is an amazing technical achievement (although with a $270million production budget, one would hope so) but not an overwhelming compelling story. Cameron turns his 'Aliens' plot of bad-guy aliens infecting humans on its head -- good-guy aliens must defend themselves against humans who have figured out how to infiltrate genetic copies of the aliens. The alien 'Na'vi' strike more than a passing resemblance to native American tribes or at least a Hollywood version of peaceful, nature-respecting, earth-connected natives. Cameron's aliens are all lightness and good even beyond those found in Disney's 'Pocahontas'. Cameron's bad guys are the Marines from his 'Aliens' feature and the sleazy corporate executive role first played by comedian Paul Reiser. Sigourney Weaver also returns and provides the middle ground between the sweetness-and-light aliens and the rapacious humans as well as providing the technical bridge our hero, Jake Sully (boy, there's a movie character name) takes to transform, like Wikus in 'District 9, into one of the aliens. Cameron throws in some mountable, flying dragons from 'Eragon', some 'Jurassic Park' dinosaurs some of which fly and some of why have hammerhead shark heads and most lazily some 'Beauty and the Beast' wolves and 'Dances With Wolves' horses with a few extra legs thrown in. Yes, you've seen it all before elsewhere but never rendered by someone with 5 years and nearly $300 million to spend. The effects are immersive and impressively seamless; I especially liked that the arrows thrown around by the 11 foot Na'vi look like spears when they puncture the hapless humans. In short, in this year's Best Picture Oscar race, 'Avatar' is the New York Yankees and we all know how that series turned out.",7,3,5,5 December 2011
Frank," Losing faith in madness
","According to conventional wisdom Paul McCartney's comfortable upbringing lead directly to the bouncy but inane parts of The Beatles catalog while John Lennon's tortured childhood produced the inspired, timeless bits. In 'Frank' keyboardist Jon Ronson takes us through his loss of faith in the most cherished artistic belief - that crazy is the soil from which talent springs. His idol, in this fictionalized version of the Frank Sidebottom character, gets presented as a mad musical genius twisted by a bleak upbringing in wildest Kansas. As Ronson integrates in the band the evidence that Frank/Chris is just a decent musician with deep mental problems mounts but Ronson having already committed financially and spiritually continues to tilt at the windmill that eventually the unpronounceably-named band will produce an album for the ages. Step by step, Jon comes to understand that Frank/Chris and bandmate Clara, played in a one-note fashion by Maggie Gyllenhaal, will take any step to avoid coming out from behind the physical and proverbial mask to face an actual audience to be judged on actual work. This progression and the ultimate peeling away of the mask that occurs in the same small Kansas town prompts a fascinating discussion of faith, madness and common beliefs about the artistic temperament. In short, a very under-appreciated film well worth your time.",7,0,0,19 January 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Entertaining but overrated
","Currently leading in the most overrated movie of 2009 race, this sloppy pastiche of movie clichés has ridden an underserved wave of acclaim. Raimi trots out Hollywood?s current favorite stereotypes including:1) Ambition can only be rewarded in men and attractive women ? true Alison Lohman is no beast but we are told repeatedly her character used to be FAT! Thus, it is morally justifiable that she be condemned to hell for all eternity for not granting a third mortgage extension. 2) ?Ethnic types? have magical powers - in this case the eastern European Ilenka Ganush can condemn people to hell (yet somehow can?t keep up with house payments) and Indian Rham Jas and Hispanic Shaun San Dena can protect people from this fate (provided the condemned have a platinum card). In Bollywood films, are the White Christian characters imbued with supernatural powers? 3) White Anglo-Saxon parents are bitter snobs, yet their prejudice melts away if you just stand your ground - such as when Christine Brown exhibits ?backbone? to the boyfriend?s mother by bringing a cake to a dinner party 4) Scientists instantly become believers on the thinnest exposure to the supernatural ? the boyfriend character (played by the guy who sells MacIntosh computers on the television) starts as a Prius-driving disbelieving psychological researcher and professor but lays down 10 large for a séance because his girlfriend thought she saw a demon 5) Cats and goats are substitutable for human souls ? vegetarian Christine chops up Fluffy on the advice of her fortune-teller and Shaun San Dena and her supernatural crew plan to sacrifice a goat because apparently while he would like an immortal soul, Satan will take small to midsize domestic animals insteadHaving said all that I do give Raimi credit for slipping the M. Night Shyamalan-before-he-got-lame ending pass me - it saved this thing being a complete waste. Go see ?The Others? instead.",5,0,0,5 December 2011
Rio," Who's a pretty bird?
","Combine the vivid colors of 'Finding Nemo' with some of the plot devices of 'Up' (most especially telling the backstory through a series of old photos and press clippings) and what do you get? Unfortunately, the combination results in a film not as memorable as either of those Pixar semi-classics. 'Rio' like 'Avatar' focuses on blue hued creatures hassled by evil humans (when did we get so self-hating?). Both films are also gorgeous to look at but revolve around only moderately interesting stories and a general lack of witty dialog. For example, despite the main character being a blue-colored macaw called 'Blu', the film never goes for the obvious joke of another character mistakenly confusing him with a bluebird. The soundtrack also misses the chance to use the old Duran Duran song 'Rio' or the old Judy Garland number 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' (blue birds fly). Instead the repetitive sounds of samba dominate the soundtrack and most audience members likely agree with Blu who expresses his distaste for Samba. In short, 'Rio' looks gorgeous but lacks substance - rent any Pixar film instead.",5,1,1,6 December 2011
Limitless," Apologies to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
","Unfortunately, Hollywood's original ideas ran out before the 2nd millennium did and so we are assaulted with remakes of 'The Dukes of Hazard' and 'The Smurfs'. With this Bradley Cooper star vehicle at least Hollywood is cribbing from a 16th century classic producing a better-living-through-chemistry retelling of the legend of Faust. In this version Satan is Big Pharma who have, for reasons only understandable to the writers, have produced a miracle smartypants drug that they are withholding from the public. Our loser protagonist gets hold of it and all hell breaks loose. On the drug, he does all manner of immoral acts: seducing his landlady, leading a business merger, playing the stock market and running for New York state Senator. Along the way, he wears some nice suits and gets to mistreat Robert DeNiro who deserves so much better than the film. The film raises some serious ethical concerns, primarily, is Eddie Morra supposed to be the good guy of the piece? Is he any less guilty than those presented as antagonists? If you can get around your moral qualms, the film presents some enjoyable effortless genius fantasies although some make absolute no sense – how does having a 'four digit IQ' make you able to do a lot of sit-ups and win fistfights? Some attractive characters and funky camera work do help to distract if not genuinely entertain. In short, pick a film that will make you smarter.",Null,8,10,28 August 2011
Zombieland," Lightweight quick-witted subgenre movie.
","If there is actor better suited than Woody Harrelson to play comically disturbed tough guys he probably doesn't have enough juice to open a film. His casting and that of Jesse Eisenberg as the nebbish-y Columbus Ohio elevate this feather-weight zombie comedy from good to very good. The plot which could be thoroughly summarized on an index car is also aided by gimmicks including titles which interact physically with the world of the film (similar to TV's 'Fringe') and some 'Lost' style flashbacks. The rapid-fire and snappy dialogue (reminiscent of 'The Girlmore Girls') also helps although there are obvious gaps where the writers take a breath after running short of it. To his credit, neophyte director Rubin Fleischer does not resort to gore that to fill the slow parts and limits the heavy blood-play almost exclusively to the beginning exposition of the zombie infection. Zombie films are often interpreted as societal allegories and this one could also be viewed in that light. The characters spend a lot of time driving a Cadillac Escalade and a yellow Hummer H2 the two least politically correct vehicles. Harrelson's Tallahassee is travelling the ruined U.S. society in search of Twinkies, the least politically correct food. The two female con artist characters (there are all of 6 total characters) have set for their post-apocalyptic goal getting to the Pacific Playland Amusement park -- such parks are the least politically correct and environmentally unkind form of entertainment. The Columbus character has managed to survive because he abides by a set of politically correct rules (another gimmick) that effectively make him a zombie of sorts. So is the spread of the zombie virus a means of lampooning the spread of political correctness so pervasive that nearly everyone thinks and behaves in a self-pious homogeneous fashion? Maybe. Although the hilarious Bill Murray vignette in the center of the film doesn't quite fit the thesis. Murray's classics including 'Stripes', 'Meatballs' and 'Ghostbusters' are risqué at times but never counter-cultural. Deeper meaning or not, this is a film worth seeing.",7,0,2,5 December 2011
Crazy Heart," See if for the music and Bridges' performance
","Correctly, a lot of reviewers make the comparison of Jeff Bridges broken down country singer to Mickey Rourke's broken down titular wrestler. A comparative film of a different sort is 'Gran Torino' where Clint Eastwood's broken down auto worker also looks for late life meaning and redemption in a world that has long left him behind. The more important comparison between the films is that they both offer a chance to see two masters of their craft getting to apply it to, in many ways unpleasant and unattractive, deeply flawed characters. In many ways Walt Kowalski's racist rants and atheism are more uncomfortable to watch than Bad Blake's losing track of his girlfriend's son while drinking in a bar although both actors get the audience to care about these characters anyway. Bridges makes more of less though in a movie turns on a seemingly unlikely romance – what is it about the overweight, alcoholic nomad that is worth bridging the 30 year age gap? Maybe it's the music. The soundtrack, the quality of the song-writing, Bridges' performance, the difficult to believe use of Irishman Colin Farrell as an American country/western star all impress. Yes, the mixed ending will not thrill American audiences but it is true to the story. In short, Bridges' performance and the songwriting make this required viewing.",Null,1,1,22 November 2011
Love Actually," The Most Overrated Underrated Movie
","The most famous example of the, thankfully, very narrow subgenre of holiday themed movies that feature maximal celebrity cameos and minimal story organized around a major holiday. Christmas, rather than 'New Year's Eve' or 'Valentines Day' gets the treatment this time with but despite the presence of an excellent British cast (Hugh Grant, Kiera Knightly, Emma Thomson, etc) the result is the same as equivalent American holiday outings. To put it succinctly there's no 'there' there. The film contains a pastiche of boring little love stories with obvious endings in largely unrealistic scenarios. Particularly Hugh Grant playing a single heterosexual man who ascends to the highest level of office comes across as completely unelectable in real life. Hugh's standard performance as the good-looking absent-minded middle class everyman had grown stale by this go-around and even he seemed bored. The talents of powerhouse actors such as Knightley and Thomson put to no good use seems a shame. If only they had some decent lines to say. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as porn actors who fall in love starts off as clever but quickly becomes repetitive. Everyone else just seems bored. Having said that blaming the folks involved somewhat does them a disservice as this type of quick-cut vignette film can amount to only so much given the necessary shallows it plays in given the number of subplots that the director tries to cram in. In short, ignore the advice of reviewers who talk about this trifle being unfairly underrated - the underraters have it right.",3,2,5,8 December 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," There's a very good 90 minute movie spread throughout the 115 minute runtime
","While this sequel entertains nearly to the same extent as the original, the film suffers from a surfeit of ambition. Director Elizabeth Banks builds several plots over the nearly 2 hour run time when the audience for the film is more so looking to hear the hits: women referring to each other with a certain 5 letter word starting with the letter 'b', some dirty talk but not too much dirty action, some singing and a whole lot of snark on top of an 'A' plot of an underdog singing group besting their betters. Instead we get a little too much soul-searching about graduation and adjusting to change. A second major problematic decision can be summed by saying 'too much Rebel Wilson and not enough Anna Kendrick'. Much like 'Mater' in Pixar's cars, Wilson's 'Fat Amy' character worked well as a seasoning in the original but gets too be a little to much as an more integral part of the plot in the sequel. We get a modestly serious subplot involving her on-again / off-again romance with Adam Devine's 'Bumper'. Much like her character's struggle, Kendrick seems somewhat checked out and the direction doesn't allow her to drive the film as strongly as her lead actress chops allow. The strength of the film lies in a cornucopia of cameos. In particular Michael Key's turn as Kendrick's music producer brings a host of laughs and a level of gravitas to the film. When does he get to be a lead? Not soon enough if he's this good on film. Other cameos particularly from players from NFL's Green Bay Packers and an un-credited appearance from Parker Posey, makes for a good time. In short, an entertaining if not stellar sequel to the surprise 2012 hit.",6,1,10,17 May 2015
The Wrestler," An emerging classic
","The Wrestler features the best performance since Charlize Theron played serial killer Aileen Wuornos. To say the performance is the movie is both a praise and a pretty comprehensive summary of the plot which largely follows Rourke's Randy 'The Ramâ? Robinson as he navigates the tawdry remains of his superstar wrestling career which peaks some 20 years past. There is a subplot with his estranged daughter which is brief and leads nowhere as does largely his wooing of Pam/Cassidy a single mother and stripper whom The Ram frequents. This single story arc through is interesting although ultimately Randy progresses little emotionally. The ending of the movie is a Bruce Springsteen song, fitting given the the gritty Industrial North Jersey setting and story of washed-up fame.",7,0,0,5 December 2011
Lord of War," Works as an immigrants story and healthy dose of reality
","Of course, Hollywood's stock-in-trade is fantasy so it can be refreshing to see it depict the real world in real world terms. Like 'The Constant Gardener', 'Lord of War' lays out the picks-and- shovels guys behind geopolitical civil unrest. Lots of groups would like to start a war but few have connections needed to men like Nicholas Cage's Orlov to bring the idea to fruition. Cage's natural neutral affect, normally a liability, works perfectly here as we see Orlov as the kind of mostly emotionless pragmatist will to engage in the dirty business of acquiring and reselling arms without regard to the cause they will be used for. Ethan Hawke plays his good- looking, drug-addled brother and sidekick and if this were a 'Star Trek' film he would wear a red shirt. The movie does an excellent job of demonstrating the ruthlessness Orlov needs to rise from cook in his parents' restaurant to the world's foremost arms dealer and husband to a model. It also does well at demonstrating the pressures and dangers he faces in this profession and why he has limited ability to extricate himself when he needs to later in the film. The twist ending may not be for everyone but it is a healthy dose of reality to how things really work. In short, while it appeals to a limited audience and can be something of a 'tough sit', it is well worth your time.",7,0,1,2 September 2015
Finding Dory," Why supporting characters are supporting characters
","As we learned from Cars 2, bringing a supporting cast member - in that case, Mater - to lead a sequel often essentially makes the side the entree. Watching 2 hours - and wow, is this thing too long - of Dory doing cutesy stuff and forgetting stuff becomes grindingly tedious. The miracle of 'Finding Nemo' grew out of the animators finding a way for small fish, who are essentially prisoners of the vast and largely featureless water, to have often land-based adventures without unduly straining credulity. 'Finding Dory' lacks the inventiveness when it comes to working around the limitations of the aquatic by employing an octopus who luckily doesn't need to be kept wet, who breathes are, can drive a truck, can match any background he squishes against, and who happens to have fine motor skills. Sure real octopi can open a jar to get a fish out but riding a stroller like a wheelchair comes across as a wincey bit unrealistic. The underwater seascapes drawn by the animators are amazingly realistic and if you just turn down the sound of the humorless and dull dialog, the movie is on whole beautiful to look at. There's just too much of it to look at with a runtime that features way too much swimming of small fish through pipes or underwater paths or sunken freighters. In short, Pixar needed to spend more resources on the script and less on the animation.",4,9,15,21 February 2017
Arrival," Best hard scifi since 'Moon'
","PwC's Abbott and Costello routine with the Academy Award Best Picture envelopes should have been used as an opportunity to have a rethink. 'La La Land' despite it's 6 (or was it 7?) wins was certainly not as good either this film or 'Hidden Figures'. 'Arrival' is more the narrative sister of 'Hidden Figures' than it is 'Contact' to which it has been extensively compared. First, it does not share the disastrous Deux Ex Machina second act of the Jodie Foster vehicle, instead of using a 'Pulp Fiction'-esque nonlinear structure to present a tight narrative from start to finish. Second, the science shares co-pilot duties with philosophy throughout 'Arrival' while 'Contact' eventually devolves into an 'I am your father' search for identity and failure of the movie to dance with the rationality that brought it. The invited cast to this dance acquits themselves well throughout the proceedings although theoretic physicists don't generally look like Jemery Renner. Amy Adams' doughty-named Louise is reflected in her own look somewhat past the spring of her days in knockoff Rom Coms such as the formulaic 'Leap Day'. The story very much is not a knockoff reflecting vital current issues in scientific thinking including the limits language imposes on thinking and implied limits on the human mind. Having said that the original 1998 publication date means we don't see the application of artificial intelligence that would certainly have been brought to bear should the alien visits have occurred in 2017. The story also gifts college film studies' professors with fertile discussion questions for their classes. It also reinforces the principle that all great movies have a great question at their core. The visuals, while very serviceable, are not quite at the same level of greatness as the questions raised in the script. The heptapoid aliens Abbott and Costello look more like forearms and hands thrust down from the top of the screen into a fish tank in need a cleaning. The alien ships they inhabit look more like one of those brown nuts you need a metallic nutcracker to open and our limited view within the ship is a square hallway which more like an especially deep storage unit than anything else. One wonders expects the giant hand creatures reach down and wipe it with a Clorox clean-up wipe after the humans leave for the day. In short, while not visually arresting, 'Arrival' is a smart, taught story which asks much of its audience and potentially was the best film of 2016.",8,1,10,6 March 2017
The Blind Side," Worst Best Picture Nom ever.
","In a world (called Memphis) where all of the white men are either lay-abouts or ineffectual idiots and all of the non-white people are some combination of drug addicts, thugs, and genetically good at sports there came White Woman to the rescue! When the local high school football coach is not able to provoke sufficient violence from his players, who steps in? -- White Woman! When this same coach stupidly calls sophisticated passing plays when he should be calling jam-it-down-their-throats running plays, who steps in? -- White Woman! When a African-American teenager has thighs and a rear-end wide enough to make him an stand-out football player, who invites him into her house and coerces him to play for her alma mater? - White Woman! With her sidekick White Tutor Woman, see White Woman modernize the local child welfare office, see her decorate her clients' house in a manner she likes despite what they may want, see her browbeat teachers into giving grades sufficiently high enough so her adopted son can play football at her alma mater without her having to pay the tuition! Suffice to say the longer you sit through this mess (and long you will sit through many sports montages which would have felt clichéd back in the late 80s) the more offended you should be no matter what your demographic categories you mark on your U.S. Census form. Professional football where careers last approximately 3 or 4 seasons on average and only lucky players are able to walk without pain between their 'retirement' and their often premature deaths is held out as the only form of success for African-Americans born on the wrong side of Memphis. The white men in the film played with that 'yes, of course, honey' slack-jawed sitcom Dad cowering perpetuates a burgeoning stereotype of its own. Finally, white woman should be offended that the comely Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for dressing up and doing something of a southern accent over the less attractive but exceedingly more difficult role of Julia Child that Meryl Streep absolutely nailed in 'Julie & Julia'. I hated this movie.",2,4,6,5 December 2011
Prometheus," A decent sci-fi scarefest with pretensions of profoundity
","Greek mythology, the origin of humankind, the nature of consciousness all decorate what is actually a haunted house sci-fi scarefest. Squid- like creatures jump out and impregnate space travelers, and duplicitous androids poison people who mutate in Frankenstein Monsters. The film feels very much like underwater alien scare stories like 'Deep Six' or 'The Abyss'. Of course, woven around this is the Alien mythology who seeks to make the non-Darwinian argument that humans are alien creations themselves much like the old 'X-Files' mythology does. If you like these 'ancient astronaut' stories you'll adore the film, if you think they are a lot of hokum, you'll still find some entertainment here. The cinematography, set design and visual effects are masterful. Noomi Rapace, despite her wandering accent, is a mesmerizing actress very much in the mold of Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron, who can do anything, frightens as a cold-blooded (or possibly no-blooded undercover android) corporate manager. They work well with a sometime clunky ('I didn't come half a billion miles from any men to get laid') and wildly unrealistic script. For example, after landing on an alien world some 10X23 kilometers from earth, finding an ancient military base, and leaving 2 crew members to die there, the whole crew settles in to get either high or drunk. I would imagine someone actually in this situation wouldn't need to artificially liven up the day by getting baked and would be too damned scared to throw a few back. More time spent on the script would have helped realize the films potential of being a true classic which it may achieve anyway depending on the success of the sequel.",6,2,5,21 November 2012
Despicable Me," Light but original entertainment.
","'Despicable Me' has what has become an almost unheard quantity in an age where sequels, prequels, reboots, TV to movie transfers, video game to movie transfers and children book to movie transfers -- originality. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much more than light entertainment value to go with the creativity. Steve Carell voices the hero-villain Gru with a Russian accent for reasons that seem related to perhaps Steve's feeling that he had to do something to earn all the money he was making for the voice work. There didn't seem to be anything in the plot that necessitated that Gru be Eastern European. Jason Segel voices Vector the villain-villain, a character who is nearly wholly uninteresting. The 3 children who eventually soften Gru's heart (oh, like you were unaware how this would end!) are cute but ultimately forgettable and actually a little whiny. Gru's allergy pill-shaped minions are not that cute either and also a little whiny. Like Gru's accent no explanation is offered as to just what the hell they are supposed to be. The movie tilts a little at trying to be more than just a summer popcorn movie by given some insight into Gru's mother's lack of sympathy but the backstory would have made much more sense if she was the father instead. There is also some hinting at larger issues with Gru representing old-fashioned Victorian-house owning villainy and Vector representing sleek, modern space pod-house villainy but it never really goes anywhere. There are some laughs particularly a sign underneath the one announcing 'The Bank of Evil' where Gru tries to get a loan indicating that it used to be called 'Lehman Brothers' but they generally of the slight smile and giggle variety. In short, if there is a heat wave near you and you have kids this is a reasonable way to get come air-conditioning and darkness time in.",6,2,3,5 December 2011
The Queen," A royal treat.
","When the former Duchess of York died in a foreign country due to a drunk-driving accident, the British royal family took only a passing interest. After all, Diana Spencer had divorced out of their ranks and used the celebrity they provided to turn herself into one of the globe?s biggest star often at their expense. Their subjects, who all but worshipped the tall, lean, blond, erupted into anger over ?The Royals? indifference and Queen Elizabeth II found herself facing the true possibility of the end of the monarchy. Director Stephen Frears does a masterful job of balancing the competing motivations of The Queen and her family, politician Tony Blair and a stunned and furious global public. The tension between the most traditional of institutions and its need to change or potentially perish makes this a fascinating story. The cast is so good that Michael Sheen who does a very good job as Tony Blair actually stands out because he doesn?t quite capture the full political slickness that the actual Blair exudes. Just a handful of nits keep this from being a truly transcendent movie. There are a few odd shots including a ?Grand Canyon? helicopter trip over Balmoral which feels like filler. Princes William and Harry are never shown as characters despite several scenes where they are just off camera or just behind a half-open door. Also, there is a very unlikely sequence where Her Majesty goes four-wheelin? and has to call someone to pick her up after she blows an axle (really?). However, overall a very well done and compelling movie and well worth your time.",8,0,0,5 December 2011
Straight Outta Compton," The song remains the same
","Remarkably the movie version of the rise, fall and redemption (at least of Dr. Dre) of the hyper-politicized, most radical musical artists of their time still follows a natural trajectory of fame you see in many other musical acts. Or to put it another way: 'it used to be about the music, man!' 'NWA' rose to prominence in the racial charged atmosphere of Los Angeles and tapped into a broad discontent about continuing disparate treatment throughout the U.S. Instead of writing metaphorical songs of protect, their lyrics directly challenged authority with blunt threats of violence. The movie, focused around founding member 'Easy-E''s brief life and experience with the group. Interestingly that group's experience follows a seemingly natural course you would find in other musical biopics such as 'The Doors' where the band struggles together to break through and then quickly struggles against one another once successful and then finally struggles with drugs, drink and the hard partying that comes with the lifestyle. While the story feels to have fidelity to actual events in the pre-Kurt Cobain era, apparently, much of the misogyny and actual physical violence against women surrounding the band is reduced to a cheeky line 'bye Alisha' as Ice Cube throws a woman out of a hotel room. Much has been made rightly over Ice Cube's son's performance as his father. Corey Hawkins neither physically or in mannerism quite nails Dr. Dre and R. Marcos Taylor never quite captures the natural intimidation that Suge Knight exudes. The writing and direction keep the story moving well across a long running time and juggles multiple subplots well as we see Ice Cube and Dre branch out from the group and become huge stars of their own. The music never quite comes to the forefront and plays a less prominent part of the film than similar biopics. Those looking for musical nostalgia are better off just buy the old albums. In short, while never bringing a lot of emotional resonance, the film captures a familiar pathway for a novel-for-their-times band.",6,1,23,3 March 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," In keeping with the series, a little too epic.
","To take the same source material for the campy 1960's Adam West television show and give it the 'Lawrence of Arabia' treatment takes some courage and Nolan is to be praised for his ambition. However, 'Rises' like the Heath Ledger-fueled middle installment of the series suffers from somewhat from the over-inflation. Parts of the sumptuously shot tale of The Batman's redemption meander and drag and all but scream 'something profound is happening in this scene'. The grandiosity (the football game scene alone must have cost a fortune) of the production makes certain character interactions banal by comparison. At one point, The Batman and the somewhat campy Bain (at what point did you want him to just take off the goofy mask?) get into a straight-up fistfight and the schoolyard beatdown feels a little jejune and disappointing. The borrowed parts also feel a little beneath the film particularly the opening hijacking scene which is wholly lifted from a 1993 Sylvester Stallone film called 'Cliffhanger'. The sheer scale of Nolan's vision does a good job of masking some mediocre performances. Again, the angular Christian Bale seems more at sea in the part than Michael Keaton at point escaping from a foreign hell-hole, making it back to a Gotham on the bring of nuclear destruction and arriving in town grinning like a Spanish tourist come to see the latest Harry Connick, jr. musical. Anne Hathaway suffers from a similar illness - her good-nature and bright personality are far better suited to the tween fair ('The Princess Diaries') that made her name. Having said that, you have to go back to Eartha Kitt to find a decent Catwoman although Michelle Pfeiffer's tactic of infusing the character with a dollop of crazy was a good attempt. Poor Michael Caine looks like he is putting on an acting clinic for advanced students. Having said all that, like 'Avatar' the film is a beautiful thing to behold despite the bad acting (Bale), dopey characters (Bane), borrowed ideas (the essence of the plot may have been written by Zaccotti Park protesters) and unrealistic ending. In short, rent it on pay per view.",6,1,5,21 November 2012
The Croods," Anti-religious Propaganda?
","Not since the very funny Ricky Gervais' very unfunny 'The Invention of Lying' has a film had such a pervasive anti-religious agenda. Grug keeps his family safe by following the ancient teaching on the cave wall - the doxology if you will. They follow precisely a prescribed set of rituals draw from this dogma which keeps them nourished. However, one day Guy appears and seduces the teenage Eep (it sounds like 'Eve' in the movie) by bringing her fire. This makes him the light-bringer - the literal definition of Lucifer. Grug's family follows Eep as Guy introduces other forms of formerly forbidden knowledge until they all abandon the old ways in favor of this more secular existence. In keeping of the agenda of the producers, everything works out for them because of these changes. Well, at least that's one way to interpret it. Another is to say this is largely a decent but forgettable popcorn animated movie long on visuals and short on writing much like 'Kung Fu Panda.' Certainly the film has some exciting moments and decent lines but by about the twelfth time someone is chased by a non-extinct large cat, it gets a little monotonousness. Casting choice aimed toward box office so you wind up with off putting and slightly crazed action star Nicolas Cage voicing the put-upon father with a heart of gold. Even in the tender moments you wonder when Grug is going to go all twitchy and spout the tenants of a conspiracy theory or pull out an exotic handgun. In short, atheist activists and Satanists will love the film, people with kids will appreciate that it takes up an hour and half.",5,0,4,20 November 2013

They fight. The story of Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?; no, Tony Stark vs. Obadiah Stane or really Iron Man vs bald Jeff Bridges with facial hair cut in menacing way not like he had it in The Big Lebowski. Without short-changing the movie, that pretty much wraps up the plot and it doesn?t even take that much of Iron Man to dispense with Iron Man-wannabee. There was an attempt at building a morale to the story but I think it was something like weapons are bad and super-weapons are like?worse.? The real draw here is to see Robert Downey, jr. as a superhero. As daft as that concept sounded before I saw the film, Downey is Iron Man or rather Tony Stark: drunk, overindulged, immature and following in his father?s footsteps. As someone I discussed the movie with said: ?it takes a wealthy cocaine addled playboy to really capture a wealthy, alcoholic playboy?. Jeff Bridges is also not who you would think of as super-villain material but apparently he can play anything well. Seriously, when the last thing you say him in when he wasn?t believable? In short, this was an entertaining way to kill off two hours on a Friday night.",6,1,3,5 December 2011
Monsters University," Two for the Money
","The Pixar classic 'Monsters, Inc.' called out for a prequel in the same way that 'Cars' called out for one sequel and one brand extension which is to say not at all. Anyway, the studio needs to bring in revenue while it works to recover from 'Brave' so out comes this exploration of Mike and Sully's origin story. Even given the original already established the universe, the story still lacks originality with fairly stock characters and situations. The writing fully lacks the crackling lines of the original and is someone maudlin and overly dramatic for a kids animated comedy. Billy Crystal and the always excellent John Goodman put in a journeyman effort but their occupation of the AARP demographic while playing teenagers does raise the question of why Disney didn't just find some sound-a-like younger actors (Billy Crystal's 'Lawn Gyland' accent invites easy imitation). The animation does present some great architectural shots and is colorful and entertaining. In short, had the original never existed 'Monster's U' would sit as a pleasant but forgettable summer popcorn experience.",5,5,7,4 December 2013
Toy Story 3," Paint-by-numbers Di$ney animation product.
","With their human going off to a noticeably generically-referred to 'college', the now-idle toys mistakenly get shipped to a 'Cool Hand Luke' prison-camp like daycare center. Hilarity generally does not ensue. A Big Wheel-sized amount of suspension-of-disbelief is needed to accept that somehow the Ned Beatty-voiced strawberry-scented Care Bear runs the prison, er, daycare, such that Woody & Co. are trapped in the toddlers room where they are tortured, er, played with. Since it was hard to accept the idea that the human day care mavens somehow couldn't simply put the toys into whatever room they wanted, I spent the time in the theater's darkness trying to develop a theory that the film was a veiled protest against secret CIA black-ops prisons. Given that the Patriot Act is still in effect, I will refrain from relating my ruminations on the subject. Anyway, the film has an intriguing voice cast such that it is populated deep into the character list with former actors who could open a film in their time. Also Don Rickles is in it. The script is passable with a reasonable amount of pathos for the younger target demographic but it lacks the winking adult-targeted asides such as those found in 'Monsters, Inc.' There is an attempt at this with the Ken doll trying to defend against charges of being a girl's toy but it never goes anywhere. This being Pixar, the animation is technically top-notch, however, since the toys-coming-to-life thrill is now some 15 years old, Disney must rely on the audience being too young to have encountered the conceit before. In short, this one goes into the over-rated Pixar films bin next to 'Finding Nemo', and 'Ratatouille' rather than into the Pixar classics bin which includes in this order: 'Wall-E', 'Monsters, Inc', 'The Incredibles', 'Cars' and 'Up'.",5,1,7,5 December 2011
Pitch Perfect 3," Suffers from sequel dimishing returns but worth it for DJ Khalid
","Movies not originally written as a multipart series struggle to avoid a natural decline in entertaining power. The Anna Kendrick series offers a textbook example of this cinematic principle. The nerdy acapella jokes which made the original refreshing feel stale, you've seen the song battle with unusual singing groups (e.g., the Green Bay Packers) before, the big movie-ending showdown is more ritual than riveting. To its credit the movie breaks the fourth wall to acknowledge some of these tropes most insightfully when Beca explains the impromptu sing-offs and then mentions that they always seem to lose them. Like the 2nd outing the movie could have used some editing particularly around a B plot involving John Litghow as Fat Amy's father. The gravity of sequel physics might have made #2 the bail out point if not for one man - the incomprarable DJ Khalid. The possibly genius / possibly raving idiot quote machine gets a hilarious scene where he spouts inpenetrable DJ Khalid philosphy why an assistant translates for the audience ('what DJ Khalid means here is you need to let go of the anchor of the past if you want to rise to your future.') Nobody has yet heard the first 2 or 3 lines following the scene as movie-goers were still gaffawing. In short, when will DJ Khalid get his own movie?",5,3,7,9 January 2018
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Enjoyable but overrated
","Neither fantastic nor a flop, Wes Anderson?s infringement on Nick Park?s (?Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit) stop motion animation territory presents an uneven mix of elements. Extrapolating from Roald Dahl?s children book the film mixes some concepts the kids will find confusing (Felicity Fox announces she is ?pregnant? twice and Mr. Fox has an ?existential crisis?) with elongated frantic chase scenes, many in tunnels, which eventually get tiresome for the adults. Mr. Fox kills ?Rat? on screen in an extended scene but during his killing of squabs and chickens the camera demurely looks away. Ultimate both constituents will find the film entertaining but unmemorable. There is a lot to like here, however, Clooney is pitch perfect as the self-centered Mr. Fox and Willem Dafoe dials up his trademarked brand of creepiness to the extent that you are happy to see the end of Rat. Anderson?s detailed set decoration lends a needed air of realism but his animation skills are not in the same league in terms of rendering characters attractive and endearing as Nick Park. In short, walk but don?t run to see it with the kids and be prepared to do some explaining.",5,0,4,5 December 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Let's get quirky!
","So let's get some quirky actors - Bill Murray, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, etc. - and put them in a quirky situation with boy scouts on a small island and then have a quirky narrator kind of tell us what's going to happen even though narrators usually tell us what did happen. Wouldn't that be totally quirky! In the quirkly named 'Moonrise Kingdom' Wes Anderson tries to pull the 'New Girl' television show's audience out of cute apartments and out to the flicks. There they find that the film presents some interesting dialog and plot turns as well as some decent performances particularly by the child actors. However, these charms are wrapped in circumstances somewhat over- engineered to be offbeat. The feeling of being manipulated limits the audience from fully enjoying the film although given the story can't fully sustain interest over its full length limits how much there is to enjoy. Also limiting the enjoyment are some highly uncomfortable scenes involving a twelve year old character being felt up in her underwear. People who find this discomforting (and everyone should feel uncomfortable with it) should avoid the film. In short, if M. Night Shayamalan didn't exist, Anderson would have an argument for being rated modern U.S. cinema's most overrated director.",4,58,111,28 November 2012
Flight," Heavy right-wing ideological bent (if you like that sort of thing)
","'Flight' takes us through some of the more conservative ideological elements you'll see in notoriously liberal Hollywood's output. The baddies come from the ranks of unionized workers - specifically the airline pilot's union. Bruce Greenwood's union representative gets portrayed as actively protecting the union's interest without regard to the flying public's safety from alcohol and drug-dependent pilots especially Denzel Washington's lead character here. Well below Greenwood's character on the morality scale lies Don Cheadle's union lawyer who delights in using technical arguments to squash evidence of Washington's 'Whip' wrong-doing. White Southern businessman Avington Carr (Peter Gerety) gets to be the moral consciousness of the piece willing to let the airline go down rather than hide Whip's wrongdoing and outraged that it becomes clear that Whip will walk if he can just stay sober and keep up the lies. As far as the actual movie behind the ideology, it famously received criticism for a marketing campaign portraying it as an action movie when it is very much a television-scale interior drama with a brief CGI-heavy plane crash as the only real action. Theoretically, staging the plane crash ate a lot of the budget as the remainder of the film seems distractingly cheap. Particularly in a scene where Whip drunkenly attacks his wife and son in the foyer of their Atlanta house, the audience is very aware they are watching a movie. Another major element that breaks the suspension of disbelief is Zemeckis' use of the Rolling Stone's version of 'Sympathy for the Devil' in the scenes where John Goodman's drug dealer appears. Contrasted against largely silent scenes, the choice feels gimmicky. Not gimmicky but without real importance is the 'B-Plot' of Katerina Marquez's drug addiction - she never really develops or plays a meaning part in Whip's coming to terms with his addictions and lies. Having said all this, kudos to Zemeckis and writer John Gatins for a realistic and honest portrayal of a unpleasant anti-hero much in the vein of 'Mad Men''s Don Draper and 'Breaking Bad''s Walter White. The motivations feel real across the cast. The writing could have used a few light moments as the story is more something you get through (like Carson McCormick's 'The Road') than actually enjoy. In short, fans of realistic television dramas who do not need someone to root for and are comfortable with moral ambiguity (cleverly the movie leaves open the question of whether Whip's intoxication during the crash actually helped him stay calm and tap into his creativity to same the passengers), this may be a film you would enjoy.",5,1,3,4 December 2014
Pitch Perfect," Strains mightily against its PG13 rating
","'Pitch Perfect' becomes a somewhat painful experience for empathetic souls who can feel the writers struggling against its PG13 constraints. The biggest confirmation of this is a joke involving one of the a Capella singing groups covering Lily Allen's 'F*** You'. It has to pull its punches by only suggesting bulimia jokes around Anna Camp's character Aubrey. Seriously dark lines are uttered at a whisper by Hana Mae Lee's Lilly although these are some of the funniest in the piece (as a bonding ritual she's asked her biggest secret to she stops the show with 'I ate my twin the womb'.) It's unfortunate the producers didn't abandon the tween market and go for the 'Hangover' hard-R crowd - while funny this could have been hilarious. As far as the cast Rebel Wilson's 'Fat Amy' ('it saves you having to call me that behind my back anyway') stands out among a group of actresses not sufficiently distinguishable from each other. In short, while short of its potential, an entertaining film.",6,2,4,2 April 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first outing
","Anyone else get the sense Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson are kind of slogging through this one? It may be just be and actorly attempt to emote fatigued resignation at once again being brought into the game to kill tributes but the two leads do give off done- with-this-can't-believe-I-signed-on-to-3-sequels-vibe. By contrast Josh Hutcherson shows eagerness given he has the same career prospects as the kid who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter series. The recently (and tragically) departed Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland appear only to give the proceedings prestige - their unremarkable parts could have been played by unknowns just as effectively. Having said that, seeing these folk join Lenny Kravitz in the same movie is still a treat. While the story they act in makes no mathematical sense. The Capitol needs 24 former victors minus the 2 (Katniss & Peeta) who won last year leaving 22 spots taken from the field of 74 previous winners. However, we know from this installment the youngest winner ever was 14 meaning the youngest winner otherwise must have been 15. Assuming a life expectancy of 75 years we can deduct 15 years old from 74 previous winners and assume only 59 remain alive. Choosing 22 of these at random leaves a resulting set of participants aged a minimum of 17 (15 year old winner minimum + at least 2 years ago) to a maximum of 73 (15 year old winner + up to 58 contests ago). The effects of the random draw (assuming no one would volunteer as tribute having managed to survive it once) would result in a contestant pool spanning most of that range. The movie does show one old woman contestant who has no lines and suffers the indignity of riding another contestant (there really are no good parts of older actresses). Putting the math aside the 'moves-counter moves' focus of the script as opposed to dwelling so much on the action adventure does make for more intriguing proceedings compared to the first film adaptation of the Suzanne Collins book. The jarring ending makes this the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the trilogy+1 but it does set up the forthcoming film nicely. In short, improved sophistication of story overcomes a decline in acting to produce an entertaining outing.",6,1,9,13 November 2014
Footloose," Suffers as much by miscasting as the original benefited by its casting
","To the same extent Ava Gardner movies lingered on her face in the 1950's and Jessica Alba movies visually caressed her abdomen in 1990's movies so does this moving on the backside of Julianne Hough. Likely this has partially to do with Craig Brewer's personal interests and a lack of other interesting images to look at in a pointless remake of the Kevin Bacon 'classic' (assuming you grew up in the 80's). The main drag on the film grows from the lack of a Kevin Bacon-level compelling talent among the cast. When Kenny Womald utters the iconic 'let's dance' to the camera you could picture yourself opting to sit this one out instead. When Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father and town elder finally has his change of heart, it comes as no really emotional catharsis given Quaid's earnestness and track record as the good guy leading man. Now Randy Quaid would have made an interesting and likely challenging from a product standpoint casting choice. Julianne Hough plays Ariel as more sleazy than fun-loving and her dance moves do kind of make you agree to an extent with the Reverend. As always, Andie MacDowell brings her inexcusably flat line readings to a part that could have been cut from the film with little effect. Everyone else in the film comes across as the indistinguishable chorus line from a traveling company version of the Footloose Musical. Having said all that, the movie brings some entertaining visuals although it someone screws up the soundtrack; the version of 'Holding Out for a Hero' used her is a sacrilege of the original Bonnie Tyler version of the Jim Steinman song. In short, see the original instead; although it wasn't very good either, the music was amazing.",4,8,10,31 May 2016
Deadpool," Long awaited Van Wilder Sequel continues the tradition
","Snarky, sarcastic, inappropriate, mildly racist Van Wilder is back and he's able to regenerate body parts (it's unclear whether he's immortal - would he eventually die of old age?). In this super rough, hard-R, cape-and-tights comic saga, the implausible combination of pretty and muscular Ryan Reynolds kills 90 people (by his count) and yet somehow is the titular hero. By comparison, Ajax (the name 'Mr. Clean' was copyrighted), the main baddie only tortures people (who did, after all, come to him) and puts damsels in distress. The movie mixes ranch comedy with torture porn and Reservoir Dogs type violence into a volatile concoction that will have many of the millions who bought tickets leaving the theater early. While clever at times - particularly any time T.J. Miller is on the screen - the movie has only a nominal plot centered around Deadpool's mostly uninteresting and unlikely origin story (couldn't the techniques be refined to produce mutants with superheroes on an industrial scale; sure the process is painful but so is cosmetic surgery and people line up for that?) . Ryan - presumably stepping in for a part written for Jim Carey - presents another major issue mostly around the fact that his handsomeness is so overwhelming that the latex mask he wears still leaves him more attractive than your high school prom date. Also, note to the special effects team, ever time Reynolds turned his head right or left, the mask bunched and gaped like a 60's creature feature. In short, a mess but an entertaining and sometimes witty one.",6,3,9,16 May 2016
Minions," Please come back Steve Carell
","Like Pixar putting Mater the tow truck in a lead role, this movie also confuses garnishing for the main course. Although the Despicable Me series never made it into Pixar quality territory, the films do entertain largely due to the comic timing and likely input on the script of multi-talented Steve Carell. Leaving these secondary characters in charge results in a tiresome, dragging light entertainment that will stretch the attention span of the younger set (you'll see much texting in the theater during this film). Beyond a lackluster script the basic limitation of the minions is there inability to communicate with the audience. They speak a non- subtitled variant of gibberish. While this was annoying in the Despicable series, having long stretches of it in this film makes for some baffling passages. With affable, approachable Sandra Bullock ineffective as an villain eventually John Hamm's sidekick character becomes the point of focus and, put simply, his English accent is worse than Mike Myer's Austin Powers. Speaking of that series of films, 'Minions' is set in 1968 London (mostly). How many of the film's core demographic will get late 1960's English references is a question the marketing department was surely asking when told they would have to sell this clunker (explain the 'Abbey Road' cover gag to an eleven year old). To these complaints add one more - the first 20-25 minutes are pure exposition. Towards the end of that period you wonder whether you could just go read the book instead if the all the director plans to do is to explain the tale to you. In short, the Despicable series 'Cars 2'.",4,1,4,27 July 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Probably not really Europe's most wanted
","So our heroes have escaped and living free in their native African habitat; however, they long to return to their cramped, damp enclosures in Manhattan's Central Park Zoo where they can stand on concrete and have peanuts hurled at them by children visiting the city. Um...look just go with this premise, alright? OK, the only way to return to New York, despite the fact that the penguins can build their own boats and airplanes, is to save a dying Italian circus. Um...look, again, just go with the premise. For adults, if you can suspend your disbelief and go with the silly plot you get...well, not much in return. Voice work by Stiller, Schwimmer and Rock involves them basically playing themselves with some effort at vocal demonstrability to punch up a thin script. Like 'Tintin', the strategy employed here is to keep the action moving at a frenetic pace as filler for old-fashioned concepts like dialog and story. Anyway, younger children will be delighted that the animators use all 64 colors in their big Crayola box and by multiple dance sequence. Older children and adults will be distracted by questions as to why Gia, the female leopard character has human boobs much like the eleven-foot cat people in 'Avatar' and why the Captain Chantal DuBois character is drawn with near obscene pulchritude? In short, 2012 may go down as the 'Summer of Disappointing Animation'.",4,0,4,18 July 2012
Joy," Largely the editor's fault
","Like 'Aloha', there's a point where you wonder if this was edited by either a trainee or maybe release 2.0 of movie editing A.I. Joy Mangano's life story probably lends itself to theatrical treatment but you can't tell that from this bewildering hodge-podge of vignettes. Most of the script revolves around showing how Joy's life is something of a self-inflicted misery of needy beings incapable of taking care of themselves - children, lounge singer ex- husband, father played by the once interesting Robert Deniro and mother played by the once interesting Virginia Madsen - dragging her down. Each of these miseries is then contrasted with her name. Get it? Hopefully you do because the contrast between her personal and financial misadventures and her happiness denoting name is used as a knowing wink to the audience about fourteen times. Largely the trainwrecks continue until a trip to Dallas where everything somehow turns itself around for indiscernible and un-foreshadowed reasons. In short, there's probably a biography or just Joy's Wikipedia page you could read instead.",2,2,4,16 May 2016
Moon," Small, serious and mostly satisfying.
","Many reviews talk about how Duncan Jones' succinctly titled 'Moon' represents a return to 'hard' science fiction in the same line as the classic '2001: A Space Odyssey' which both true and not exactly correct. The film actually is more in keeping with the existentialist spirit of 'The Truman Show' or Tom Cruise's 'Vanilla Sky' and to a lesser degree 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.' Sam Rockwell's Sam Bell learns to doubt even the most fundamental concepts as his memories, identity and humanity as it unfolds that he and the sentient mining operation robot which shares the moon with him, GERTY, have far more in common than he initially imagines. To describe why would get into spoiler territory but Rockwell and Duncan do a very convincing job of selling the central conceit and creating an entertaining science fiction story with $5mil, basically 1 actor, and the voice of Kevin Spacey. The story lingers with as much as the plot of the spectacle 'Avatar' which was 55 times the cost. My biggest objection with the film is an incongruous happy ending which suggests the company's moon-based personnel practices would be viewed with scandal -- maybe by this point in humanity's technological evolution, such procedures would be public?",7,2,7,5 December 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," The 'Rocky' of game shows.
","'Slumdog' precisely lived up to everything I heard about the film: the concept is gimmicky (the life story of an Indian untouchable is told through a series of game show questions) but the execution is brilliant. The first half of the two hour run-time is a tough sit as Jamal the protagonist faces the worst a brutal Indian society has to offer but in the meantime learns the answers which will eventually make him successful on the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' However, that emotional investment of watching slaughtered mothers and intentionally blinded children pays off in the second half as you become emotionally invested in Jamal continuing his dream run on the show and his continued pursuit of his oldest friend from the slums / love interest. The very end of the movie veers into Disney Bollywood style (stay for the dance number) territory but up until that point any ground gained by Jamal is paid for in torture and betrayal. In short, the film's emotional resonance is hard-won by the audience and is well-worth the effort. By the way, the central conceit for the ending of the movie came from the first winner of the American version of the game show who used his 'Phone-a-Friend' lifeline to get in touch with his father not to ask for help but to let him know he was about to win a million dollars.",8,0,1,5 December 2011
Me Before You," Enjoyable manipulative
","The weepy 'Me Before You' stars Sam Clafin, an actor so photogenic had movies not been invented before his birth, they surely would have developed once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing how handsome he is. Thewestchestarian wonders how he didn't get the '50 Shades of Grey' lead ahead of dead-on-the-inside Jamie Dornan. Sam also brings a delightful 'English-ness' to the role overshadowing the Campbell Scott original 'Dying Young'. Despite her London upbringing Emilia Clarke (please consider that final 'e' when pronouncing her surname Americans) doesn't bring that same underlying seriousness and gravitas that English actors contribute. The two work well together although you can see Clafin dictating the relationship and Clarke reacting to him more than acting. The story they act in is a bit what you would expect. Will's life basically went from the top of human experience to some area below average although he remains very wealthy and can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for. He deals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which 'Lou' holds eases but ultimately doesn't relieve. Any interesting aspect of the story is the personal growth Lou undergoes through her association with Will and, perhaps to a greater degree, his upper crust wealthy family. The movie doesn't shy away from the obvious class differences in English society. In short, you largely know where the story is headed and much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it is worth the ride.",6,1,3,6 March 2017
The Martian," An excellent example of the art of being a director
","Ron Howard famously made audiences fear that the Apollo 13 astronauts would not be able to guide their damaged spacecraft back to earth, a pretty neat trick given the film told the story of a well-publicized event where the fate of Jim Lovell and company was well-known. Ridley Scott maybe on-ups him by translating the science fiction procedural 'The Martian' into a film that makes you (in your less mindful moments) wonder how much the film reflects the real events (perhaps these are real but future events?). Also credit Scott for making a 'Castaway'-like story of one man isolated and trapped into a compelling narrative. The challenge all the greater than Castaway given the amount of straight up math involved in the book (what's is a hexadecimal anyway and how does one help you communicate?). So no Academy Award nomination for Scott? Well it is up against 'Room' where Lenny Abrahamson faced the challenge of recreating 2 people stuck in a room. Anyway, Matt Damon does get a best acting nom basically for being a likable guy who is good at math which required Damon to stretch - at least as far as the math part goes. He's favored to win largely as The Academy's way of saying: 'Suck it Leo'. The remainder of the cast is not terribly consequential, the writing is decent if a little math-heavy and the story satisfying. In short, get you STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) friends together and enjoy.",8,3,4,5 February 2016
Up in the Air," Except 'The Blind Side', the least of the Best Picture Oscar noms.
","During late 2008 through 2009 the unemployment rolls swelled so much that 1 out of 10 Americans were out of work, a number that understates the problem because it leaves out those who have given up and either stopped looking or took low level hourly work. The most relevant number is more like 1 in 6. Against this backdrop, Jason Reitman's drama about a professional corporate hit-man couldn't be more topical, unfortunately this relevance has lead a lot of critics to overestimate the film. My major issue with the story is the 'Sixth Sense' twist near the end. George Clooney's Ryan Bingham's torrid romance with a similarly transient Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) is portrayed as very intimate (the film's R content comes largely from a single full dorsal nudity shot of Vera) so without spoiling the ending, shouldn't Ryan have seen some evidence of the twist. Also, given the constant interruption of cell phones, how was this secret held through the extended time they spend together at the sister's wedding. Also the critic's comparisons of the dialogue to old Billy Wilder movies (although this film reminded me most of 'Desk Set' with was a Walter Lang film) seems a little generous. When it is talking about the business of firing people and travelling to do it, there are a number of sarcastic laughs and sharp insights but otherwise the script often drifts. Also, Ryan has a side business as a motivational speaker where he urges people to drop their burdensome attachments (something he has done to the point of hermetic airborne isolation). Doesn't real motivational speaking involve trying to get people to assume burdensome attachment? Having whined for about 300 words, I will say that the story's cynical and world-weary view of human relationships as we enter the teens very much as 'Sideways' (among my favorite 3 films of all time) captured the earliest parts of the millennium's zeitgeist of over-indulgence, self-deception and unfulfilled dreams. In summary, I would say urge anyone over 35 to see the movie and warn anyone younger against it -- as far as you know your marriage will hold, your employer will take care of you when you get older and technological progress is always an improvement. You can wait to find out there is no Santa Clause.",6,1,2,5 December 2011
