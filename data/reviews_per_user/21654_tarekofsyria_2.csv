Black Swan," Portman is the only actress who could do this film !
","when i saw black swan for the first time i thought of it as a drama trying to have the elements of thrillers.however the 2nd time i saw it i realized how deep and great it is . Portman gives the performance of her lifetime .she really turned into someone else to do this one . also what a Honor for rider to be in this film.esp that we stopped seeing her in big titles after girl interrupted although she has been in the most talked about films earlier in her career ,her role was short but had the biggest impact on the main character Nina.i read somewhere that this film was described as intoxicating . well it is and once you see it you will never stop thinking about it . we are all trapped with our demons and ideas of perfections and sometimes we lose track of what is right and wrong .realities or dreams and that is what black swan has told . Natalie Portman has convinced everyone of the pain she went through as Nina .this film is perfection in every sense and it has captured us with its magic . i recommend you should watch it on a weekend with a clear mind because it will give you a lot to think about .thank you .",10,0,1,19 March 2011
Orphan," such films can change the history of thrillers ..amazing ,,!!!
","orphan starts like any other thriller,however it develops into something addictive, tasteful. and not clich√©d that will force you to watch and leave with u with nothing but great respect for the cast that have delivered the best , some films were made in the last few years with the same suburban concept but none had succeeded in staying with the viewer like this masterpiece . what helped achieve the success is the original script and how deep it was and how it created the characters rather than the shallow tackling that we see in horror thrillers in which every role has limited part to play and could never be charismatic like the cast of orphan . Vera Farmiga was amazing and believable . the little girl was also original . cinematography did justice to the story and added more mystery and suspense which in-return made the cast look valid and relevant . i recommend this film to anyone who is after original thrillers ,juicy stories ,and acting that will haunt you for weeks .just give it a chance and you will see . thanks for reading this .",10,1,2,5 April 2012
