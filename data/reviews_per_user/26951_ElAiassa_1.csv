Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Haven't laughed this hard in a long time!
","Just saw this movie at a pre screening in Copenhagen, Denmark. And I loved it. Already being a fan of the show, I had quite high expectations of this film. And it didn't let me down one bit. On the contrary, it managed to go where the show has never been near. And beyond. Yes, it is a mix of set up scenes, and the familiar documentary style that you are used to, if watching the show. But I just opened up and let it all in. Set up or not.. And it was an extremely funny and provoking comedy. The way Sascha Baron Cohen manages to show peoples lack of compassion, and normal openness to other people is just brilliant. No matter what ppl should say, he is a very talented and sharp person. Give yourself a laughing shock treatment, and see this film. Cant wait to the official premiere, where I definitely will have another go. EEts Niiiice!!",10,5,25,23 September 2006
