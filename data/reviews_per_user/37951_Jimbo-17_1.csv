The Blair Witch Project," The only terrifying part was the price of admission.
","I was not only disappointed by the movie but actually disgusted that I could get suckered in by the hype. That's all this movie is. I was expecting to go into the movie and be terrified. I wanted too. I knew it had a slow start so I waited for it to get scary. It never happened. It was not scary. Believe me, I scare fairly easily in films and fully expected to walk out of there with my heart pounding. I walked out instead upset and even mad. I felt like telling everyone else in line to forget it. The only genius part of this movie is the marketing. That, I will give full credit for. I was taken and so were the 9 other people who accompanied me to the movie because of how much I hyped it. I apologize to them and hope no one else will get duped the same way I did. Stay away from the Blair Witch Project unless you want to pay 9 bucks for a film that could almost easily be aired on the discovery network or public television. DON'T GO SEE THIS ONE!!!!",1,1,3,30 July 1999
