Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star wars episode 1 the annoying kid and the CGI
",This film is absolute rubbish.Jar Jar binks should be shot tarred all over and used as a very big torch.You can see why some animal parents eat their young. As for Anakin he was so annoying. Its great to think that the most powerful Jedi saved the film by accidently pressing a button. Yippeeeee he must have thought. This film only got 3/10 for me simply because its star wars.George lucas stop directing you had the right idea with the first 3 films.Ps the CGI is crap i think he should talk to peter jackson and his staff about how to do properly and with out so much shinyness,3,0,1,17 March 2003
Man on the Moon," Carrey is brilliant
",This is one of the funniest most interesting films i have seen for ages.Carreys performance is  absolutely brilliant especially as Tony Cliftion.Me and my friends are still doing his impression half a  year after watching the film. The film is touching and portrays a comic genius who finds it hard to be  understood.I have to admit i was pretty ignorant to who Andy Kaufmann was but now after seeing  this film and Carreys performance it must of been amazing to have been around at the time when  Andy kaufmann was alive.The film is brilliant 9/10,Null,0,0,3 April 2003
