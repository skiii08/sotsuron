Requiem for a Dream," is this the best film of the last 10 years?
","tastes differ, that's one thing that is quite sure.  but, once in a while, there is a movie which stands up and should be appreciated by ANY taste, nonetheless which this taste is.  Requiem for a dream is such a movie.although the plot might not be very advanced (the movie handles the lives of 4 people who are affected by addictions and loneliness and are eventually totally bereft of their humanity), the rest of this movie is quite superb above many other movies.  First, the music.  Almost every 5 min, a scene is accompanied by a piece of music (by Clint Mansell and the Cronos Quartet) and NEVER is the music unappropiate.  In fact, the music is even that good, that it is actually worhtwhile to buy the soundtrack.  Second, the acting is genuine, never forced, always convincing.  Ellen Burstyn's acting scene, when she confesses to her son how lonely she is, is so touching, really unbelievable.  The direction, with beautiful, sliding shots, split screens and hallucinating takes of the downward spiral of the 4 main characters, gives you enough information on how shitty their lives are and simultaniously keeps you glued to the screen.  Shocked and intriged, not much films succeed in this.As a reaction to a reviewer which stated that Trainspotting is better than this movie because T. shows the good signs and bad signs of drug use, you are completely wrong!!! T. is a buddy movie, where the subject of drugs is taken as a side story development (first, i really liked T. , but the purpose of this movie, unlike R., is not to shock its audience, but to amuse and along the way show what drugs can do). In R., the downward spiral after the addictions in general have kicked in.  Therefore, R. is most of the times a shocking film, but with also many beautiful scenes where the main characters try to keep their humanity, before totally collapsing (the scene where Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto at the end of the movie are talking to each other over the phone is truly moving!).I think this is one of those movies which have to be seen. NO words can describe the true power of this motion picture.  For me, everything is perfect.  Even when i don't know, i think the coffee for the actors and filming crew was perfect.  as my title reads, i think this is the best movie of the 10 last years (yes, i have seen The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, Existenz,......).  Never has a movie succeeded in gripping me, changing me and fascinating me for many days after i have seen it.Therefore : watch Aronofsky's further projects, this man is the future of 'Quality American Cinema'!!!",10,0,1,10 May 2002
Vanilla Sky," Open your eyes and you will notice the mistakes
","Abre Los Ojos was a great film, with solid performances, haunting atmospherics and a unexpected, original ending. Vanilla Sky is the remake, a film that tries to copy Abre Los Ojos and fails rather miserably.In fact, you can say it very simple : if you have only watched Vanilla Sky, than you're in for a movie that reaches some nice intellectual heights for an American movie with an original ending. But, if you see this movie and then see the original (or if you had already seen that one), Vanilla Sky suddenly becomes a quite lame movie. Which is a shame actually, because I like Tom Cruise and certainly because he has given the attention to Amenabar he deserves. Cruise has always been to me one of better actors in America. But Cruise should have known that the quality of the original could never have been injected in the remake. There are a lot of things which make the original better, but now I'm going to give the 3 main points why this movie is way underneath the original :1)the performances : how hard Cruise tries, he never puts as much tragedy and quality in his role as Eduardo Noriega. But this goes for every actor here (also Cruz, who had a more sharp, vivid character in the original)2)the approach : the original is more scary, leaves more to the imagination of the audience and has a better ending (yes, vanilla sky manages to remove some of the intensity of the original ending!!)3)the music!!! : although the songs on their own are good (2 songs from my fave band REM), the music is just totally inappropriate and actually ruins some of the scenes. you know what i'm talking about when you can compare the 2 moviestherefore 1 advice : just go see Abre Los Ojos and wait until Vanilla Sky comes on television, late at night. Ironically, that's what the special featurette on the VHS edition suggests!!!",5,31,58,28 July 2002
