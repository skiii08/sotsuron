Howl's Moving Castle," Good in itself, but not if you're looking for a repeat of the book
","After seeing Spirited Away and loving it, I couldn't wait for the newest animation movie to come out from Studio Ghibli. This movie also happened to be a animated version of my favorite book, Howl's Moving Castle. After seeing the movie, I loved the animation and music score, and the plot was very interesting, if confusing at times. The thing that took me by surprise is that the plot line is so different. Some names are changed, and one of Sophie's sisters doesn't even exist! I know those are small things, but there are many other, more major, details that have been changed beyond recognition. However, if you have not read the book but wish to see the movie, then you will enjoy the movie. Just be prepared for a surprise when you read the book and compare the two!",7,1,3,5 June 2006
