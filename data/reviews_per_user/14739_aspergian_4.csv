The Lobster," Uninteresting.
","I understood the 'comedic' satiric on relationships and the human condition and so on, but, like all the film that I happen to discover have been directed by Yorgos Lanthimos it just wasn't interesting. It felt like you were being subjected to someone's, presumably the director's, personal piece of ideology, maybe based on his angsty diary entries was being shoved in the everyone's faces. Okay, maybe I'm not being totally serious, but, point is, the film is a bit like the stereotypical experimental film a college student would churn out for their latest project they've been assigned by some pretentious, overbearing art teacher.",1,2,3,23 January 2019
The Big Lebowski," Painful to watch
","I had high hopes for this film. However, they were quickly dashed when I sat through this American drivel. The 'humour' of the film consists of stilted acting, monotonous deliveries. All of these are probably deliberate and presented in a blatant sarcastic way that just passes as dull. It's way apparently really funny to focus your main character, who is a card board cut out dullard, to say mind numbingly unfunny things and all the banal phrases that are considered universal language to the club of a young generation at the time the film was released. The film is a testament to the recurring claim that Americans don't get irony and when they try to apply it they desperately grapple at it clumsily like in this film. It's probably the worst attempt at a comedy I've ever had the misfortune to witness.",1,4,17,29 September 2018
The Favourite," Don't let the trailer fool you. This film is one big cartoonish farce carry-on.
","The film does touch upon the absurdism of the ruling elite but barely which is why I will give it a 2 instead of a 1. It is stunning that this film is THE first film that elicited a desire for me to go to sleep. Sadly, I couldn't because of the appalling repetitive strings and organ playing, the former of which attempts to create a sense of pacing, the latter a sense of imminent castastrophe. The advertising of the film led me to believe that the film would focus on the wider history of why Queen Anne is the way she is, examining her reign and so on. However, this is not what the film does at all. NOTHING HAPPENS.Instead we get an initially semi-interesting but quickly uninteresting story of two largely similar machiavellian women who fight for the queen's affection, interspaced with a melange of scenes of palace debauchery, stunted attempts at comedic irony and absurdism, the odd slapstick moments and sarcastic 'witticisms' that aren't really all that interesting of funny except if you are one of those who boast and prattle on endlessly endlessly about sarcasm being your 'second language'. The attempts to make the audience laugh are so frequent that the drama in the film is more akin to a bad television sitcom comedy-drama than a periodic drama. It's a shame that Queen Anne didn't play a more central role in the film. The acting was good, the writing and style of the film just wasn't.",2,20,36,8 January 2019
Parasite," Mediocre, at best
","I'm unsure as to why the film has been overrated. The main theme of the film is status, class and betrayal. However, I think the film fails to make these themes compelling and thought-provoking enough to motivate the audience to care about the characters. The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family, despite their poor economic background.There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film's plot to be too chaotic and convoluted. compelling enough. As a result, there is something missing from the film. The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey. Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic, unrealistic way. This affects the believability in what you're seeing, thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters.Forgettable.",5,8,34,11 February 2020
