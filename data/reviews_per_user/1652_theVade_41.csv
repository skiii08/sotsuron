Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 did to Blade Runner, what Rogue One did to A New Hope.
","Blade Runner 2049 is not only one of the best Sci-Fi films to date, but has instantly become one of my favorite films of all time. It is first a piece of art before being a means of revenue, and was the best and only approach to the classic film that anyone could have asked for. It not only answers dying questions but presents news ones, and is a great addition to the beautiful landscape of the Sci-Fi genre as probably one of the best films that the genre has ever seen. The acting is superb, the visuals are to die for, and the story is unforgettable. Sure some might argue that the pacing of the film is slow at times and some characters are left underdeveloped, but Blade Runner 2049's negatives come with their trade offs. Both Zimmer and Wallfisch bring back Vangelis' iconic score in a new and creative way, and Villeneuve has solidified himself as one of the greatest directors of our time. In the end I decided to give Blade Runner 2049 the highest rating I could possibly give it, as it won itself The Golden V as well as 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. And with all that being said, my closing thoughts on Blade Runner 2049 are ironically the same as to what the film is meant to represent. It is a replicant that is more human, more masterful, and more beautiful than its original will ever be.Read more at theVade.",10,3,16,8 October 2017
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The better of the two films.
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was ultimately the better of the two films, and was honestly a fun and entertaining movie. Although the movie suffered from pacing issues in the first half of the film, the villain and twist definitely made up for the boring first half. And even though I wanted to give this film a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar, an alright first half and a very good second half just don't add up to be a 'Very Good' in the end. So with that being said, I decided to give Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. It is a fun film with one of the best villains I've ever seen, and yet it suffers from some minor pacing issues. But still go out and watch this film as the third installment might be on its way very shortly..Read more at theVade.",7,2,2,11 July 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.
","10 Cloverfield Lane was a good movie, and definitely one I'd recommend. Was I disappointed I didn't view it in the theater? No. 10 Cloverfield Lane was a good late night movie full of some surprising twists. The plot and pacing of the movie were very well done, but I felt the end and some character arcs lacked a bit in detail. So to finish things off, I decided to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.Read more at theVade.",7,5,8,11 July 2017
Catch Me If You Can," There wasn't much that I found wrong or exceptionally great about this film.
","There wasn't much that I found wrong or exceptionally great about this film. It had some great comedic moments, and I felt that it was an entertaining flick all the way till the end. How much of it is true is beyond my knowledge, but for a man to get away with so much.. it's kinda crazy. I will say that other than the great characters and their development, this did not feel like a Spielberg film. It just didn't have that masterful touch that I usually get from his other films. Is that bad? Well, no. It just doesn't feel like his best movie. So in conclusion I gave Catch Me If You Can a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. Although I wanted to give it an 'Alright' this film's characters and actors were outstanding and really made this film a good movie. The small issues with how the story was told, and Jennifer Garner's character (kidding) really held this film down from being a truly memorable one. If this film showed each event in chronological order this movie would have had great suspense and would have be a great movie overall, yet all it really gives us was Jennifer Gardner, and no one really wants that.Read more at theVade.",7,3,4,11 July 2017
It," One of the greatest horror films that I think the genre has ever seen.
","Other than some really really minor issues I had with the film, It ultimately provided audiences with one of the greatest horror films that I think the genre has ever seen. The fantastic cast, characters, scares, and tone leaves this as one of my all time favorite movies, and a film I will have no problem watching in the years to come. Because of It's fantastic direction in its story, acting, and execution, I have decided to give It The Golden V as it also receives 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Chapter Two cannot come any faster, as it has me counting down the days until 2019, but until then I will just have to continue reviewing horror films with the constant line of, 'Still not as good as It.'Read more at theVade.",10,5,10,13 September 2017
Detroit," A little unworthy of the big screen.
","Although this was a great film with some minor flaws in its pacing and exposition, it still provided some incredibly tense moments and some great acting. There are of course some times where you begin to ask yourself how much is fiction and if that could truly happen, but then again this was a completely different world that these people lived in 50 years ago. In the end I decided to give Detroit a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although this is a story that everyone should know and remember, it's a story that only takes a half hour to tell, which is a little unworthy of the big screen.Read more at theVade.",7,2,7,16 August 2017
Memento," Nolan nails it again.
","This was a great film, and another favorite from Christopher Nolan. The story was fantastic, the acting was superb, and what else is there to say? Nolan nails it again. Sure there was a few issues with the pacing in the beginning of this film, but in all it was completely necessary to explain the unique type of storytelling that this film uses. So with that in mind, I decided to give Memento a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10 since it is just another great film from the Nolan brothers.Read more at theVade.",9,1,2,11 July 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One is the prequel you're looking for.
","Rogue One is not only one of my favorite Star Wars films, but also one of my favorite films of all time. The great story, characters, visuals, and so forth made this film incredibly memorable, as this movie will hold a special place in my heart. Although the score sucked, and the pacing was a little choppy in the beginning, I can forgive most of that. In the end, I decided to give Rogue One 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. So yes, Rogue One is the prequel you're looking for.Read more at theVade.",10,6,8,11 July 2017
Passengers," Just a good movie.. Barely.
","After thirteen months or waiting, horrible marketing techniques, and numerous issues within the film, Passengers ended up being a good movie in 2016 yet not the best movie of 2016. So with that I decided to give Passengers a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. With so much going for it, I felt like what I looked forward to the most about this film (the screenplay), ultimately turned out to be what I didn't enjoy the most about this film.Read more at theVade.",7,3,5,11 July 2017
Zootopia," One of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen.
","Zootopia was another great Disney film, and the better of the few that they've made in the past decade. Yes, Disney and Pixar are two DIFFERENT entities. So to conclude, I decide to give Zootopia a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The film had fantastic characters, animation, and adult (semi) references, but its lack of clarification on its exposition, and forced relationship issues just bogged down the movie a little too much, to the point where I felt the need to dock the movie for those issues. In the end Zootopia is one of Disney's most political movies I've ever seen, but the use of fluffy little animals still doesn't give it enough momentum to make a change in the real world. It does make for a good kids movie, though.Read more at theVade.",7,2,6,11 July 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The Spider-Man movie audiences deserved, and the MCU needed.
","Spider-Man: Homecoming was the Spider-Man movie audiences deserved, and the MCU needed. It is a refreshing take on the iconic character that audiences have grown so fond of, and is so elegantly executed in every aspect of the film. Tom Holland is Spider-Man, and the best on screen adaptation of the character to date, and his enthusiasm for the character can be see throughout his performance. Michael Keaton was a fantastic villain, and one of the best the MCU has seen, as he is humanized to the point where the audience both fears and understands him. The writing in this film is fantastic, the characters are phenomenal, and Spider-Man: Homecoming is one of (if not) the best MCU films to date. Spider-Man: Homecoming won itself a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10, and will stand as the new standard for MCU films.. lets just hope Sony doesn't screw this one up.Read more at theVade.",9,26,46,11 July 2017
Suicide Squad," This film could have been great, but just didn't have enough life to make it better than what it was.
","Suicide Squad had some great performances by both Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and had a fantastic soundtrack. For the most part this film was pretty entertaining when the villain, pacing, and setting wasn't holding it down. So for my review of the film I decided to give Suicide Squad an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. This film could have been great, but just didn't have enough life to make it better than what it was. I came into the film knowing nothing about the movie or characters, and walked out having felt my free ticket and $8 dollar drink was worth my two hours of sitting in the theater. 'So should I go see it?' Well that's a great question. If it's raining out and you have nothing else better to do, then sure. But other than that, I think the only worth it has is renting it from Redbox 6 months from now.Read more at theVade.",5,3,5,11 July 2017
Doctor Strange," Everything I wanted in a Marvel movie.
","This movie gave me everything I wanted in a Marvel movie. Was Doctor Strange one of my favorite Marvel movies? Yes, I have to give it that. This was just a fantastic film with fantastic characters and actors, yet had some very minor issues in exposition, and a pretty anticlimactic ending. So in the end, I decided to give Doctor Strange a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. If you haven't yet seen this film, go and do so right now, as this might be one of the best Marvel movies you can see right now.Read more at theVade.",9,2,3,11 July 2017
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more.
","Full Metal Jacket was one of Kubrick's better films, and to be honest I was pretty torn on what to give this film. Although many will go against my decision, I decided to give Full Metal Jacket an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. The film had outstanding visuals and audio design, but Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more. The acting in the film was great, and the tone literally put you back into the Vietnam War in 1968 (when the second and third act take place). This was an extremely hard film to watch, but I felt it was an absolute great representation of what war really is. So in conclusion, although Full Metal Jacket had some great moments, it was ultimately three short films tied together by one thing.. Kubrick. And I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough.Read more at theVade.",5,4,7,11 July 2017
The Lost City of Z," A film that most people won't understand.
","The Lost City of Z is a film that most people won't understand. If you love film and love the art of making film, you'll love this movie. If you want to be blown away by action sequences and drama filled romance, then this isn't the film for you. In the end I decided to give The Lost City of Z a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. It's acting, writing, sets, cinematography, and drawn out runtime make this a great film for those who are tired of the nonsensical superhero movies of today. This is a one-of-a-kind film, and one you'll definitely want to lose yourself in time and time again.Read more at theVade.",9,2,5,11 July 2017
Watchmen," So who will watch the Watchmen? Probably not me, anytime soon.
","Watchmen was a movie I had such high hopes for, that just didn't blow me away like I intended it to. The story and characters kept this film from me giving it a 'Bad', but the long runtime, slow pacing, confusing story lines, weird ending, and lack of climax left me disappointed with this film. Yeah, some people loved it, and some people hated it, but I just felt like it was an alright movie. So, in conclusion I decided to give Watchmen an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 5. So who will watch the Watchmen? Probably not me, anytime soon.Read more at theVade.",5,2,5,11 July 2017
Baby Driver," A movie that will have you racing to the theater time and time again.
","Baby Driver was a beautiful classic in today's day in age, and features a great set of characters, a great cast, a great story, an beautiful visuals all to the sound of an incredibly memorable soundtrack. With that I gave Baby Driver a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10, as it has to be one of the best films I've seen all year. This has to be Edgar Wright's best film, and is a movie that will have you racing to the theater time and time again.Read more at theVade.",9,7,12,11 July 2017
Split," I will say I am impressed with Shyamalan's first real hit in over 15 years.
","Split was a pretty good film. Although Shyamalan holds a special place in Hell for what he did with The Last Airbender, I will say I am impressed with his first real hit in over 15 years. In the end, I decided to give Split a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The film had great acting (for the most part) and had a great story, but its anticlimactic ending and horrible supporting characters really bogged this film down. Hopefully the sequel to the film won't have me too split on its rating the next time around.Read more at theVade.",7,2,6,11 July 2017
The Shining," The only shining star in list of duds.
","The Shining was a fantastic horror film from Kubrick, if not one of the best films in its genre. The Shining has almost everything going for it, great cinematography, great sound design, great suspense, great characters, with the only negative being (personally) an anticlimactic ending. But in the end I decided to give The Shining 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Not only is this one of the best horror films I've ever seen, but it is also one of the best films I've ever seen, and that is why I decided to give The Shining The Golden V. So congrats Kubrick, you've made a fantastic film. Too bad it's the only shining star in list of duds.Read more at theVade.",10,2,5,11 July 2017
Dunkirk," A story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget.
","Dunkirk was one of the best films of the year, if not the decade. Its unique way of storytelling and emotional score provided one of the best films that Nolan has directed to date, and is an amazing masterpiece in modern film. Although its unique way of storytelling might turn some people away, it left me with my jaw on the ground and tears in my eyes. Nolan's direction in visuals have progressed beyond that of Interstellar, and proved to be one of the most visually stunning pieces of film in a long time. With all that in mind, I had the easy task of rating this film, which won itself The Golden V, as Dunkirk received 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Nolan continues his streak of memorable films by providing us with a story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget.Read more at theVade.",10,11,23,23 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The Harry Potter name is what truly keeps this new series alive.
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them received a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. This film sets up a beautiful new world in a world that is very different from the one we were used to seeing in Harry Potter. Although some (like myself) were hoping we would come out feeling like we just saw another Harry Potter film, this is a completely different movie. The acting was great, the look and feel of the film was good, but a lot of the story was left untold or just moved too fast for the audience to truly grasp what was going on. But in the end I look forward to what is next in this new franchise, and unlike (the name) Kubrick, the name Harry Potter is what truly keeps this new series alive.Read more at theVade.",7,1,2,11 July 2017
Liar Liar," Yeah, it was stupid, but it was funny.
","Liar Liar was a good movie, and definitely something I'm glad I had the time to watch. Sure the storyline was crap, and Carrey's acting is either something you love or hate, but in the end I still decided to give Liar Liar a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Yeah, it was stupid, but it was funny. And if a movie can get me to laugh hard enough for me to not care about story, then I guess it deserves that rating in the end.Read more at theVade.",7,3,4,11 July 2017
Get Out," There really isn't much to complain when it comes to Jordan Peele's first film.
","Get Out is a fantastic film, and a hit for audiences around the world. The acting is great, the story is great, the pacing is fantastic, and the movie looks fantastic. There really isn't much to complain when it comes to Jordan Peele's first film. So to go with all of my praise, I decided to give Get Out a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. I can't wait to see what will come next.. possibly a film called Come In? Who knows?Read more at theVade.",9,10,19,11 July 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A mediocre film from a dying series of great films.
","Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. It's heartbreaking to say, but I have to agree with what Mark Kennedy from the Associated Press said about this film. 'After this fifth episode, you'll wish Disney would just declare the franchise dead and tell no more tales.'Read more at theVade.",5,34,52,11 July 2017
The Imitation Game," If you're looking for a drama filled, realistic film with huge amounts of Cumberbatch, then this is your movie.
","The Imitation Game was a pretty decent movie. The story was alright, emotions were fantastic, acting was phenomenal, characters were alright, and the dialog was great, but this movie had a few short comings that just couldn't go unnoticed. This film had the ability to be such a great movie, but was bogged down with some boring characters, and unnecessary plot points. If it were up to me, I would of focused solely on the story of the team breaking the Enigma, and less of Turing's life. The movie opened with such a bright story and ended with a really depressing epilogue, and because of that I just didn't feel a huge connection to this movie at all. Overall, I gave this film a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10, since there were some really good, and really just eh parts to this film. If you're looking for a drama filled, realistic film with huge amounts of Cumberbatch, then this is your movie. But if you're looking for a action/war film, put this film back onto your shelf and go look for a different movie.Read more at theVade.",7,2,3,11 July 2017
Logan," One of those movies that I feel will age better with time.
","Logan was a good time and definitely worth the price of a ticket to see it. Keen's character is fantastic, and both Jackman and Stewart were great while their characters weren't as fleshed out. The western tone gave the movie a distinct feeling, unlike any other superhero film, but gets boring in the lack of set pieces. The finale takes chances that are unexpected from these types of production companies, and really brings out a lot of emotions that one might not expect to feel when walking into this movie. In the end I decided to give Logan a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Although it's a little higher than I wanted to give it, this is one of those movies that I feel will age better with time, ironically the opposite of Logan's character in Logan.Read more at theVade.",7,4,10,11 July 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," It was a movie that had too much, but not enough.
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a beautiful looking and sounding film, with horrible pacing and little to no character development. It was a film that should have been 30 minutes long, but instead was filled with boring, dragged out sequences and black screens. Overall, I do not think that 2001 should stand as THE movie that defines the sci-fi genre. I'll happily give that title to Star Wars from now on. So to conclude this review I decided to give 2001: A Space Odyssey a 'Bad' on theVade Review Bar or a 3 out of 10. It was a movie that had too much, but not enough.Read more at theVade.",3,7,14,11 July 2017
La La Land," I will definitely be singing songs from this movie for years to come.
","Overall I really enjoyed La La Land. It was energetic, heartfelt, and yet kind of slow at times. But even with those slight issues with pacing and its anticlimactic ending, I still really enjoyed La La Land for what it represented in 2016. In the end, I decided to give La La Land a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The acting, music, and visuals were excellent, and for the most part its story was pretty entertaining. It is definitely worth all of the praise it has been receiving, and I will definitely be singing songs from this movie for years to come.Read more at theVade.",7,3,5,11 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," So let down by this movie.
","So let down by this movie. Rooker and Cooper were probably the best thing to come out of this film, and the only real comic relief came from Bautista and Klementieff's characters. Other than that, Guardians was just a mixed bag for me. I really wanted to like it, but the forced comedic moments, poor plot design, and mediocre characters and performances just left me feeling pretty dull about this film. In the end, I decided to give Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. This film had so much potential, but ended being a giant let down. I knew from the moment that they green lit this movie after the initial one's success that it would never live up to its expectations. Scary part is, the third one has been green lit after this one too.Read more at theVade.",5,19,32,11 July 2017
Sausage Party," Nothing more than just a limp wiener.
","Sausage Party was probably one of the funnier movies I have seen this year, yet its mediocre storyline, and villain kept me from truly enjoying it. It is definitely a rated R film, and if you're not into sex, drugs, and cursing, than this is not your type of movie. So in the end I decided to give Sausage Party and 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. Although it gave me a good laugh at times, it was nothing more than just a limp wiener.Read more at theVade.",5,2,4,11 July 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Disappointed by this highly anticipated film.
","The film was just alright as it never blew me away nor left me wanting to leave the theater. John C. Reilly had some pretty good moments, and both him and Samuel L. Jackson stole the show when it came to any sort of character development, but isn't that wrong that I care more about the human characters than Kong himself? None of the cast is even remotely important, and like I said above, most (if not all) the characters were used as expendable exposition. Sure the end came with some awesome fight scenes and decent art style, but what is a movie named Kong without the King himself having a bigger role than the expendable humans? In the end I decided to give Kong: Skull Island an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. Yes, I was disappointed by this highly anticipated film, but the creative team should feel even worse when the best part of this film was a post credit scene dedicated to the cooler older brother in the newly extended monsterverse.Read more at theVade.",5,3,4,11 July 2017
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes just didn't seem to sweep me off my feet like some other films have done in the past.
","Sherlock Holmes just didn't seem to sweep me off my feet like some other films have done in the past. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were exceptional, and the sound and score to this film were absolutely phenomenal. The plot and story were great and the pacing was great, but I just didn't feel blown away by the film at the end of the movie. So with all that being said, I decided to give Sherlock Holmes a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. If you haven't already seen this film, go out and do it right now. This film has some great moments and I believe it is worth your time watching it. Sure it might not be the most amazing film you'll ever see, but that's not the point. The point is to entertain you, immerse you, make you laugh, and make you want to uncover the mystery. And I believe that Sherlock Holmes nails that perfectly.Read more at theVade.",7,1,1,11 July 2017
WALL·E," Let's hope that after Pixar's season of reboots we will have some original films like this one.
","There wasn't much to complain about this film. The storyline and way of storytelling was great, and the visuals weren't bad but the use of actual actors did take away from the immersion of the film. With all that being said, I decided to give WALL-E a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. This was honestly a great Pixar film, and like I said above, I think that this is one of the better Pixar movies I've seen in a long time. Let's hope that after Pixar's season of reboots we will have some original films like this one.Read more at theVade.",9,1,1,11 July 2017
Arrival," It had everything it needed to succeed, but the execution of its story will definitely turn people off.
","There wasn't much that I disliked about this film. The build up from the first two acts quickly dies off as soon as confusion sets in with the third act, and that is what honestly led to the rating I decided to give this film. In the end, I gave Arrival a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. It had everything it needed to succeed, but the execution of its story will definitely turn off people wanting to truly understand this film. Ultimately, Arrival came in as one of the most interesting films of 2016, but will not be staying in people's minds for very long.Read more at theVade.",7,3,6,11 July 2017
Wonder Woman," A great change in pace for the DC Extended Universe.
","It was a good film, and a great change in pace for the DC Extended Universe, and I hope to see Snyder learn from this film with Justice League later this year. Wonder Woman featured a stellar cast, a fantastic lead, a great origin story, and beautiful score, but still suffered from some minor writing issues, and was a little too reliant on its CGI. Gal Gadot nails her role, yet again, and won herself a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or 7 out of 10 for Wonder Woman. Although this is the film the DCEU needed, I look forward to November with the Justice League since that's the film that we deserve.Read more at theVade.",7,5,13,11 July 2017
Mother!," An allegorical film which will be either loved or hated.
","Overall, mother! was an interesting film which will be either loved or hated by members of the audience. The ones that love it will understand the message that Aronofsky was trying to paint, while the ones that hate it will be mindless fools who went in with the intention of it being another stupid horror film. Luckily I had a small bit of knowledge going into the film so I was able to understand the picture pretty well. While others might not have the same luck, it's really not hard to catch on by the third act. In the end mother! was a truly unique film that featured a beautiful hidden message, and won itself a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. Aronofsky's allegorical film is another one of those movies that will leave the intelligent dumbfounded, and the dumb invoked with more questions than answers.Read more at theVade.",7,1,7,5 October 2017
Blade Runner," By no means a bad movie, but it was not an amazing film either.
","Blade Runner got an 'Alright' on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10 since it was by no means a bad movie, but it was not an amazing film either. I was completely torn between giving this movie and 'Good' and an 'Alright', but I felt my honest opinion after watching the film was just.. eh.. So in conclusion, Blade Runner looks great, sounds great, and is an alright movie overall. It does lack, however, in some of its pacing and confusing plot design. This is not the end for Blade Runner though, as a sequel is in the works right now, and I will review it when it comes out as well.Read more at theVade.",5,4,9,11 July 2017
The Matrix," An above average score for an above average film.
","The Matrix brought in a mixed bag of both good and bad. On one side, its original story and setup for the next film is great, while on the other side, its mediocre acting, and aging visuals keep me from truly loving this film.

","Other than minor gripes, there wasn't much to hate or love about this film. Maybe in ten years when people forget about living through this event it might actually be a remarkable movie, but it ultimately crashes a little too short of a 'Very Good' on theVade Review Bar because of it's predictable and abrupt ending. So in the end I gave Sully a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. If it wasn't for its fantastic cast this film would have just been a mediocre movie, but Hanks ultimately saved this film from crashing to the Hudson.Read more at theVade.",7,1,2,11 July 2017
Alien: Covenant," It was just a damn good horror film.
","Alien: Covenant is a film full of a great cast, great characters, beautiful landscapes, and haunting sounds, but what this film really strives to be is a great horror film, and I can assure you that it does just that. Although the film was a great addition to the Alien franchise, its choppy jumps between action and narrative alongside its sorta predictive climax leaves this film on the cusp of greatness. In the end I decided to give Alien: Covenant a 'Good' on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. It's the prequel Alien fans have been asking for and the sequel Prometheus fans have been dying to see. But to me..? It was just a damn good horror film.Read more on theVade.",7,2,7,11 July 2017
V for Vendetta," It is beautiful take on the classic 1984, and yet this one includes a happy ending.
","V for Vendetta is arguably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie had great plot, great characters, great actors, great dialogue, and some short comings when it came to its confusing backstory, and minor pacing issues. Other than all that, V for Vendetta gets 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar as it is one of my newly found favorite films. Not only did I give V for Vendetta 'Straight V's' on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. In conclusion, V for Vendetta is one of the best films I've seen so far, and succeeds in almost every category. It is beautiful take on the classic 1984, and yet this one includes a happy ending.Read more at theVade.",10,4,6,11 July 2017
