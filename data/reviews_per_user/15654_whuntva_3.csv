Requiem for a Dream," The Ultimate in WTF
","I have no idea what to say about this film. Is it good? Maybe. Is it bad? It shows shades but it is not terrible. I have never seen such a film which gets so much right yet at the same time so very much wrong. It is well shot, acted, directed, and as for writing says what it wants to say very well. However, it is a major downer, cannot seem to hold interest, and the message is a bit heavy-fisted throughout. I feel the suffering, but much of it seems overblown. I would not recommend this to anyone, but still feel it to be a technical marvel. I guess if you're really curious you could see it, but it is too disturbing for most and will not resonate strongly due to the way the message is portrayed. The five stars you see in the review are just for convenience so I know I've seen it. My actual rating is *null*/5 because no star rating would do my opinion of the film justice.",5,2,3,27 November 2013
Iron Man 3," An All-too Familiar but Still Enjoyable Experience
","This is better than the second one. It is not as good as the first one. I think everyone has said that, but I still like this movie quite a bit. There is a philosophical side to this movie. Iron Man has gone down to Earth, experiencing symptoms similar to PTSD, and is suddenly thrust into his job again by forces beyond his control. There is a twist involving the true villain, and this actually works in the film's favor. The villain is usually who we least expect. Tony is crushed spiritually by his burdens, and this villain is smart enough to exploit that. I thought this writing was very clever.It is a Tony Stark movie, and that's perfectly fine. Marvel knows what makes their movies work and uses that to their advantage.",7,0,2,13 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Best Film of 2013
","How did this get shut out at the Oscars? No film got me talking, made me think more, or left me feeling more satisfied this year than 'Catching Fire'. And this is coming from someone who HATED the book. This film may also be the most relevant to the time. It is a blatant satire of celebrity culture. Our decadent society is always one step away from the Hunger Games. The culture is decadent and violent, but this is the harsh reality of our world. It hurts, but it's so true. The movie also looks GORGEOUS! At least nominations for Makeup, Visual Effects, and Costumes, please. Is it better than the original? Certainly so. And the first one was great as well. This should have gotten more awards buzz.",10,5,23,16 January 2014
