It," Not disappointing
","As a fan of the book since my early teens, I was ready to be disappointed. However, I was not. 
Sure there are a lot of things I really would have wanted to see on screen that did not make it, but most of it would have required a new mini series, or more. My biggest fear was actually the moving of the story to the 1980's, instead of keeping it in the 1950's as it is in the book. However, this was not at all a problem, as the same tone remains.The young actors portraying the protagonists of the Losers Club are doing a remarkable job. Bill Skarsg√•rd is an amazing Pennywise (I'm not just saying that because we're both Swedish). The only two issues I have really, is the relationship between these kids could be stronger. There is so much focus on finding Bill's brother and IT, that the strong bond that the kids should have is slightly thin. The second issue is the focus on IT as Pennywise, rather than the entity it is underneath the clown mask. While Pennywise if frightening, the notion of something far worse beneath the make up would have made him far more frightening.Hopefully, the next installment will delve deeper into both of these issues. With that said, it is a wonderful movie, and one that even the most die hard fans of the book should love.",8,0,0,5 January 2018
Hereditary," Disappointment
","Perhaps if critics had not called it the scariest movie ever, and the distributors subsequently sold it as that (referring to said critics), maybe I would have liked it better. But on the other hand, maybe not. Tony Collette is brilliant as always and is the sole reason for pushing my rating from 3 stars to 5. Aside from her, the movie hasn't got much to brag about. It's a movie that can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a family drama or a horror movie, and ending up being neither, rather than both. It is a movie I've seen in many versions before, and this is the artistic version. Except for the ending, which is not artistic at all, nor dramatic or frightening. In fact, it almost seemed to have been edited in from some ridiculous B-horror movie from the 70's.Maybe if they had edited out all the 'horror' scenes and focused on the drama surrounding the family after the tragic events that they experience, I'm certain it would have been a very good drama. But now, it is simply two hours of disappointment.",5,0,0,28 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Not sure what I just saw.
","I must admit that I have grown tired of Marvel movies. The extended universe not only entails that every movie and character must be connected, but also that you can't see a Marvel movie without having to see all of them in order to understand the context. I have seen all (I think, but frankly I can't be sure anymore, as they tend to blend together). Most of them are enjoyable to watch, but they do not offer much in the sense of emotion or thought, which means they are easily forgettable.In this case, I had no idea what had preceded the movie (yes, I saw Age of Ultron, but still have no idea how Bruce Banner ended up in space). And in fact I am still not sure if I saw a Marvel movie or a parody of a Marvel movie. There was so much that did not add up, so much that was too silly or anachronistic to make any sense. Sure, I laughed at times, but I that's pretty much all the emotion this movie got from me. It's not bad, it's entertaining at times, but it didn't really make much sense, and it certainly did not make me think enough to believe that I will remember any of it tomorrow. In conclusion, this movie tries hard to recreate the combination of humor and action that worked very well with Guardians of the Galaxy, but fails.",4,0,2,2 May 2018
The Conjuring 2," Not worth your time
","Sure, there is some truth to the story, in the sense that two girls made up a story of possession (which has been thoroughly debunked) and that Maurice Grosse was there as a paranormal investigator. With him was Guy Playfair (not depicted in this movie) while the Warrens were hardly involved at all. A far better, and more frightening dramatization of these events is the British mini-series The Enfield Haunting, although that, like this, does conclude that the haunting was real. Great cast, inspired by an interesting story, but frankly, the movie turned out quite boring and not particularly frightening.",2,1,3,14 June 2017
A Quiet Place," Lovely, in spite of everything!
","Let's face it, there are some really big question marks here. Like who would put a nail from underneath a board in the cellar stairs?! I mean, it can't ever have served any kind of purpose! And I get that Krasinski's character was badly hurt, but he could have at least tried to swing the axe, right? And really, the governments/armies or whatever never tried to blast the creatures with high pitched noise, even though they were clearly aware of the creatures being exceedingly sensitive to sounds?! Or are they more sensitive to some sounds and less to others? It seems somewhat unclear what they hear and not...Normally such things would lower my rating. But I forgive the movie entirely. It succeeded where so many others have failed, in making a slow paced, quiet movie suspenseful rather than boring, and in spite of the minimal amount of dialogue, we actually get to know the characters very well, and feel for them.So screw the question marks and just enjoy this little gem!",7,3,7,24 May 2018
It Chapter Two," Too much of the wrong things...
","What the first movie got right was a balanced focus on IT and the lives and friendship of the children in the losers club as well as their relationships to each other. No such thing exists in the second chapter. Instead it seems to think that the audience will feel for the adults just because we felt for the kids, and that we should be satisfied with the relationships we got to follow in the first movie. Such is not the case. I'm not given any reason to care about the adults, so I don't.So what's left? Chapter II starts out quite faithfully to the book, although very abbreviated, until they're all back in Derry. After that, almost nothing is left of King's book. With no relationships nurtured or rediscovered, it is just a painfully long series of jump scares and scenes that seem to compete for the title of most disturbing. However, due to bad animation and a lack of build-up, eventually the myriad of attempted scares cross the border into tedious silliness.Halfway in, I was begging for it to end, and in the end I was nearly crying because simply did not believe that it ever would...",2,2,3,6 December 2019
Annihilation," +No, it's not too 'brainy'
","This review will contain some book comparisons. I'm sorry for this, but I simply can't help myself. I read the book upon which this movie is based, and I found it mind provoking and entertaining (unlike its far less interesting sequels). Although I wasn't a big fan of Alex Garland's movie Ex Machina, I was excited to see what he would do with Annihilation. Especially given that some claimed it was too 'brainy' for a theatrical release here in Europe. Well, its not brainy. Certainly not if one compares it to the book. I was aware of Garland's choice not to re-read the book before writing the script, and I was prepared for him to exclude some of the book's strangest and unfilmable sequences from the movie. I was not prepared for him to have changed nearly everything except for some or the basic story. In fact the whitewashing debate seems redundant, since Natalie Portman's character is so far from the one in the books. Sure, it is a beautiful and poetic movie. But it is not mind provoking (/'brainy'), or especially intriguing. It is a light version of the book that fails to address some of the most fascinating things about Area X and most certainly the characters. So to conclude: The characters are without depth, the story as well. However, it is shrouded by a poetic and colorful shimmer (see what I did there?) that clearly is meant to divert attention from these flaws. 
My recommendation: If you want poetry, beauty, but also(!) interesting characters and 'brainy', then read the book!",6,0,1,12 March 2018
The Martian," Missed the mark completely
","Man, this movie made me angry! It attempts to make the audience feel sorry for Matt Damon's character, but all I could think of was what a selfish bastard he is. He risks the lives of his former crew mates, makes them stay in space more than a year longer than they should have, and I don't even want to think of the financial costs, and all because that egoistic turd decided he wanted to stay alive (and then takes all the credit himself for being alive in the end). If he would have thought about anyone else than himself he would have killed himself! Some of his crew mates had families, for crying out loud, which he obviously did not care one bit about! So the failure of this movie is clearly that the message of hope, that one should never give up ('solve one problem and then the next' and etc.) is overshadowed by the fact that the main character is a stubborn, selfish bastard who obviously valued his life above those of others.",2,2,3,14 June 2017
