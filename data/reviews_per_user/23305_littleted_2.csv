Deja Vu," Massively underrated.
","I'm not going to explain the plot as most people reading this will have watched the trailer. I watch this movie everytime it's on its that good. You can't go wrong with a cast of this calibre, Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Jim Caviezel, Val Kolmer. I don't usually bother with sci fi movies but this is a brilliant thriller from start to finish, fantastic visuals strong story and great acting a must see.",9,1,1,8 August 2018
Wedding Crashers," Silly but excellent.
",You either love this film or you hate it. Wilson and Vaughn are the perfect modern comedy duo like Abbott and Costello. The humour may be a bit near the knuckle but the chemistry between the leads more than makes up for it. All the cast do a great job shame there's no plans for Wedding crashers 2 .....,7,1,1,21 July 2017
