Requiem for a Dream," Good, but it's Style over Substance (no pun intended)
","Most of the reviews here have been, in my opinion, excessive with the praise. This is a good movie, but not a great one. Does this movie really get inside the mind of what it feels like to be a drug addict? Yes. Does this movie have some inventive, perhaps even pioneering, camera work? Yes. But does this movie really tell a story? Uh...no, can't give you that one.I won't rehash the plot, but of the four characters, Ellen Burtsyn's was the only one with something resembling a story, and even hers is more of a stream-of-consciousness meditation on addiction. A very stylish and pounding stream-of-consciousness, but a stream-of-consciousness nonetheless. She wants to be on a game show, which never pans out, and in preparation for her TV appearance, she gets hooked on diet pills and goes nuts. The other three characters--well, they just wallow in their addiction until they are either in jail, turning tricks, or having limbs amputated.Jared Leto's performance is passable, but he's really a bland actor out of his league with this material. Connelly and Wayans come off better, if only because their characters (at least in the movie version) are two-dimentional at best; the quality of the supporting performances mostly lie in their ability to convey the hunger of addiction in closeups and extreme closeups. Burstyn is certainly impressive, but after seeing this, I'm glad Julia Roberts won the Oscar instead (I can just hear the hardcore film buffs hissing at that).As for the direction...well, yeah, it definitely makes you feel something, and it's not pleasant (but, of course, that's precisely the point). For conveying the feeling of addiction, I give this film lots of credit. Yet, the eye candy camera work only covers up the lack of depth in the story.That being said, I'm reviewing this movie in comparison to conventional narrative films. I would be inclined to classify Requiem for a Dream in a slightly different category--rather than a narrative film, this is more of an experiment in visualizing the subjective experience of drug addiction. On that level, it's a perfect success. But the movie's more like one of those simulation amusement park rides--the theme being drug addiction, and it's a REALLY scary ride--and a satisfying STORY it is not.",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
Coyote Ugly," Trailer is deceiving
","I was disappointed in this movie. Based on the trailer, I expected it to be a sort of 'Cocktail' for girls. I was hoping this movie would have a lot of the electric booze-pouring scenes from the trailer, but if you've seen the trailer, you've seen about all there is to see (except for a pretty good wet t-shirt sequence). Unfortunately, though, the movie spends a lot of time with Piper Perabo's character whining about her songwriting career and a totally unnecessary, by-the-numbers romance with the type of movie character I like to call an 'Accent Boy' (i.e., apparently, his whole charm lies in his foreign accent, here, Australian; see also Ben Chaplin in 'The Truth About Cats and Dogs'). I found the romance scenes boring, and the other bar girls' characters underdeveloped. I thought this movie would be about a bar (e.g. 'Cheers'), but it's really just another insecure-girl-goes-to-NYC-to-make-it-big story. You've seen this story before, and if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the good stuff already.",Null,1,1,6 August 2000
Gangs of New York," One of the worst Best Picture nominees ever
","This movie is a sad failure, as it's obvious how badly Scorsese wanted to tell a story about this time period and how much hard work he put into the details. But the movie ultimately fails because of a very thin story overwhelmed by artifice - and two unfortunate casting choices.I think it was Scorsese who has said that the majority of a director's job lies in casting the right actors. If that is true, the movie is doomed by the choices of DiCaprio and Diaz in two of the lead roles.I like Diaz and think she's a charming, effervescent, and sexy screen presence. But she has a very modern appearance, demeanor, and spirit, and she just does not work in this role.As for DiCaprio, regardless of whatever acting talent he may possess, he cannot overcome his own physicality. DiCaprio has the face and body of a young teenage boy, and although he is getting close to 30 now, his appearance has not aged much since 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape.' He hasn't yet developed an adult man's beard growth and still has a chubby, cherubic face (with a whisker here and there above his lip and on his chin). And although his teenage fans are many, DiCaprio just can't convey true adult masculinity, virility, or sexual tension. His appearance works well in, say, 'Catch Me If You Can,' where the role is that of a teenager masquerading as an adult.But in this movie, we are asked to accept him as a tough, vengeful, full-grown man who is able to murder Daniel Day-Lewis's legendary upperclass thug Bill the Butcher. It's so preposterous a notion that the actual act is obscured by smoke in the climactic scene (though we do see an aftermath shot of DiCaprio with a dirty face and scruffy red hair, looking much like Chucky from 'Child's Play'). This is no fault of DiCaprio's, really - it's just a monumental act of miscasting. Just as a reasonable audience could not accept, say, DeNiro as an overweight black woman or Streep as a high school cheerleader, DiCaprio simply does not have the physical appearance to be convincing in this role.Day-Lewis, however, is not miscast, and gives an amazing performance, although his modern-cliche-sounding Noo Yawk accent was at times distracting and over-the-top. Imagine how different this movie could have been with, say, Colin Farrel or Heath Ledger or Ewan McGregor paired with, perhaps, Kate Winslet or Helena Bonham-Carter.But what bothered me most about this movie is that, even aside from the casting misfires, I was never able to suspend my disbelief. Everything about the movie seems artificial, even the sets and costumes; I assume they are authentic in appearance but seemed like something out of a Dickens PBS/BBC movie. This movie cost about $100 million, I've read, and the production values do look expensive. But they still didn't seem believable to me. I was always aware, perhaps becuase of the meagerness of the story being told, that I was watching footage shot on a elaborately-constructed Cinecitti backlot.There wasn't a single frame of this movie in which I was not acutely aware that these were actors in costumes, on sets built in Italy, and that Scorsese was standing just off camera telling everyone exactly what they should do.I suppose this is an interesting, neglected time period in history, and not a bad idea for a movie setting. Yet a setting is not enough - the movie needed a compelling story. All the work and money has gone into these background elements (expensive sets, costumes, actors, and special effects) without having anything very interesting in the story department. The movie would have been much more successful artistically if it had cheap costumes, shabby sets, unknown actors - but with an actual story that could hold our interest.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
