Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Jedi Knights should have gotten George Lucas in a 'death grip' and forced him to rewrite the screenplay!
","The dialogue throughout 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace' is trite and banal. Liam Neeson's acting talents are wasted as is Ewan McGregor's (see 'Moulin Rouge') in something that even the wizardry of George Lucas can't rescue. Instead of Liam Neeson's character, Qui-Gon Jinn, dying near the end, making way for Ewan McGregor's character, Obi-Wan Kenobi, graduation from a padawin (sic) to a full-fledged Jedi Knight, I think a more interesting plot would have involved the kidnap of the young Anakin Skywalker by the Dark Forces. Then, perhaps, the doubts of the Jedi Council as to Skywalker's having the 'Force' within him, could have been united by their efforts to rescue him from his abductors.",2,0,1,28 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," At last, a movie with a moral!
","A fantastic musical! I loved every second of the 'SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR!' I can't understand how 'A Beautiful Mind' won the Best Picture Oscar over this magnificent production.The moral that is given in 'Moulin Rouge' is something that I firmly believe in. 'THE GREATEST THING IN LIFE, IS TO LOVE SOMEONE AND TO BE LOVED IN RETURN!!!'Throughout the centuries philosophers have tried to describe what life is about with thousands upon thousands of words used in each of their complex discourses. I wonder what the ancients would have replied to the moral stated here? The only philosopher that I can think of that comes close to giving us something so true and yet so simple is Jesus Christ.Joseph Campbell abridged these words of wisdom even further when he said to Bill Moyers during an interview shortly before his death, 'FOLLOW YOUR BLISS!'BRAVO!",9,1,2,28 May 2002
