Conquest 1453," Flawed, but commendable on some levels
","I was incredibly eager to see the film, but finding an official release date for the DVD or a place where I could buy it in Egypt seemed impossible. Alas, I managed to get a copy.Let's preface this by saying I love Turkish culture. A picture of Abdul Hamid II hangs on my wall. I even enjoy the 70s and 80s exploitation flicks, and definitely 70s Anatolian rock. Fetih is a bittersweet affair for me. On one hand it represents the country's ascent over the past decade; on the other it unfortunately falls victim to imitating a western style medieval epic -- a played out genre that ordinarily bores me to no end.The introduction of an obligatory love triangle between a good and evil suitor signaled that some disappointment was in store early on. The five-second closing shot was like dumping a bottle of ketchup onto an overcooked steak: it took an already mediocre meal and made it even less appetizing. I don't really care for CGI in general, but each time the director used it there was no mistaking it. That might be forgivable in a fantasy film, but not a historical one. Some of you may claim that historical inaccuracies for the sake of entertainment are just the nature of the medium; the problem is this that these men were so pivotal in history that spreading a distorted image (even if done graciously) is disrespectful. When twenty-year old viewers become seventy, this film's portrayals will be stuck in many of their minds -- accurate or not.This will not be the last Turkish blockbuster. It needs critiqued honestly to push Turkish cinema forward, though. I wanted to give this a 10/10, but in the end it's so dumbed down that it's merely a slightly above average movie. There's some great Turkish films out there: Jan Jan and Propaganda are two I've watched recently -- two pics that are uniquely Turkish; Fetih feels more like a generic American war epic but with Turkish characters. If Adam Sandler films are 0/10, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest a 10/10, Fetih is a 6/10. Its importance lies more in what it signifies in relation to Turkey's modern resurgence as a great nation and the Islamic renaissance occurring in places like Egypt, not so much its content.",Null,6,13,26 August 2012
The Terminal," Turned a fascinating story into complete drivel
","It's a shame that Spielberg transformed Mehran Karimi Nasseri's real life nightmare into a sappy love story with a happy ending.Nasseri was an Iranian who sought political asylum in Britain, but lost his visa while in transit. Britain forced him to return to his previous connection in France, where for eighteen years he attempted to wade through bureaucracy and even a short stint in prison.Except for a couple of months in jail (it may have been less), he resided at the airport the entire time, ordering the same exact meals from the airport's Burger King each day. He loved economics and became extremely well-versed in it during his stay.A lawyer at last was able to help Nasseri obtain legal status. Nasseri, who claimed to be the son of a British mother and Persian father, refused to sign a document with Mehran Karimi Nasseri written on it, but insisted it read Sir Alfred Mehran -- his 'true' name. He subsequently returned to the airport.So the story is really much darker, with a touch of mental illness involved. The fact that this was even allowed to happen, and that a sick man was not tended to for so long is where the real drama lurks. Mehran was eventually sent to a French halfway house after spending almost two decades on the same bench.Spielberg, felt he had to anglicize Mehran and transform him into essentially Andy Kaufman from Taxi. It became a quirky little film rather than something that could have been more akin to A Beautiful Mind with a touch of bureaucratic torture involved. Maybe someone could have told the story correctly and intelligently, though I doubt they will in fear of copying Spielberg's bastardization of the man's life.",Null,3,5,4 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Unlikeable, clichéd characters ruin it
","A whore, Shaggy from Scobby Doo, a racially ambiguous faux nerd, and a supposed virgin who's -- actually not. None of them have any redeeming characteristics; none of them would be particularly missed by society. In fact, forget the Gods, can I kill these people myself? The world is better off with monsters at the helm, assuming that they intend to annihilate both the film's creator and any critics who praised it.The occultist allusions, and the concept of human sacrifice for an elitist group's advancement are the sole interesting elements of the picture. Unfortunately those ideas are left unexplored in exchange for special effects and horror clichés that caused Freddy Krueger to walk out of the screening.",Null,2,4,15 October 2012
