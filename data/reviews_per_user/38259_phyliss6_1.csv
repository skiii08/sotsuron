Marie Antoinette," Not worth the time to view it!
","One of the most disjointed, inaccurate renditions of an historical figure, coupled with a sophomoric attempt to inject contemporary music into a period piece. Who is responsible for letting this make it to the big screen? It rivals Dumb and Dumber in its execution. No credible dialog...no story worth telling...lousy acting...an excuse to create lavish costumes and orgies of food in a magnificent setting. A wasted opportunity. Unfortunately those who see this film without first knowing the history of that period will come away with a distorted impression of the French people. Hopefully they will leave with a better idea about how certain Hollywood executives are allowed to rewrite history, using it as an excuse to have great time filming in France. For shame.",1,1,3,23 February 2007
