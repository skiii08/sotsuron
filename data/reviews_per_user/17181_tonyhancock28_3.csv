Hereditary," Anyone who likes this drivel are lying to themselves.
","A huge disappointment after waiting for a while to watch this. I am very glad I didn't waste money on it. It's trying extremely hard to be an old fashioned horror like The Wiker Man and failing miserably. People are talking about the dreadful ending...okay, what about the dreadful start and middle then? It's just all complete rubbish. For forty minutes I sat there with this foreboding music coming in and out with absolutely nothing happening on screen. It's a joke it really is, the critics must be taking the pi**??? I am sick to death of over hyped films that critics fall in line with but everyone else with any sense hates. I hate this film, I hate everything it stands for and I disagree with anyone who thinks they like this nonsense.",1,0,3,1 September 2018
Interstellar," Utter Rubbish
","I was really looking forward to this, being a Science fiction fan and looking forward to seeing an excellent cast deliver.I was utterly disappointing. In 30 years time, people will look back at this movie and laugh and just how wrong it really is. I have no problem with the latest scientific theories and this does try to relate to what you might call the pinnacle of modern physics.It gets it horribly wrong. I just cant stand how it introduces this science like we are all physicists and in an instant are expected to accept it as fact. Its a Science Fiction movie trying to be Science fact and ultimately this is why it fails.NO doubt it will receive rave reviews on here from Nolan fanboys who are all to eager to make intelligent remarks about how clever it really is.It really is not clever at all. Its bloated, ponderous and completely ludicrous.How on earth does it get 8.9??? pun intended.",1,6,15,23 January 2015
It Follows," I can't think of words to describe this utter drivel
","To sum up this movie, girl has sex with man, girl is then followed by ghost type thing who will kill her if they catch her..but the ghost type thing can only walk not run (apart from the occasional levitation on to buildings!?) Girl can pass on this 'curse' if she shags someone else but if ghost type thing kills recent shag, it will come after her again and so on. How so many people can think anything good about this film is completely beyond me. I watched it on the basis of critics reviews and the IMDb scoring. If I could give this film 0/10 I would just to balance out the idiots who think it's any good. If you are like me, you will go ahead and watch the film anyway...and you WILL be disappointed. The worst film, worst 'horror' I have ever witnessed. Is my ten lines up yet? 1 hour plus of my life wasted.",1,113,237,30 May 2015
