Blade Runner 2049," Unnecessary
","What gave the original its appeal was its experimental cinematography. An overdose of close-ups combined with fast-paced editing gave it an intensity and an energy that this one lacks. It made the city streets feel claustrophobic and alive. With long stationary wide shots, this time around they're playing it safe and just trying to appeal to nostalgia towards the universe. As a result, they're forced to over-rely on plot and set design to make the story interesting, leaving it feeling distracted and overly focused on bells and whistles.",7,0,4,14 February 2019
