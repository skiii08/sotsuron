Skyfall," Skyfall big disappointment, it's another phantom of solace
","Big disappointment, skyfall is just 30% of Casino Royale. Bond movie should be more lethal, glamorous big action, spicy movie, but skyfall missed all required ingredients despite of famous director Sam Mendis. The final output is big flop, another phantom of solace. I never expected such a pathetic movie when bond completed golden jubilee of 50 years, and I don't think they invested 200 million, for me they spent 20 million for the movie, and they going to get pocketed almost 1 billion dollars with big hype. Bond movie should be international, and not a domestic bond. It appears to be people expect more action with some brainy plot like Casino Royale, but they want to show more storey type movie like recent Batman, the same disappointment. Nobody want to see bond movie is more dialogue and storey movie and boring.",4,14,31,30 October 2012
