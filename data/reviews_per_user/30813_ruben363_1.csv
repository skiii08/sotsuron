Miracle," Awesome!
","This movie went far beyond my expectations! I had read some reviews which stated that this was the greatest sports movie ever. This movie goes way beyond being a sports movie. This movie is about a generation that, unfortunately, saw and experienced a lot of things that went wrong in our country back then such as Watergate and the Iranian takeover of the American Embassy. This movie reminds us that, along with all the negative events that occurred, something very magical also took place. You don't have to be a hockey fan to like this movie. I'm not one and it did not matter at all. The game represented a lot more that just a hockey match.",10,0,0,7 February 2004
