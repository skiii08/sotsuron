Raiders of the Lost Ark," least of the three
","Although Raiders gets bonus points for being the first of the trilogy, it was still lower on my scales than the second and third movies.  It was kind of fun finding the Star Wars references carved in the Ark, so if you have never noticed them, it is worth seeing again.",Null,0,2,16 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," still figuring it out
",The Usual Suspects is a thought provoking movie on so many levels.  The script is perfectly twisted and witty.  It is a movie you can memorize and still want to watch over and over.  New ideas always seem to come.  It is a great movie to create theories for.,9,0,1,16 October 1999
The Princess Bride," I love this movie
","The Princess Bride is such a fun witty movie.  Every character has their moments of hilarity.  It is one of the best quoting movies of all time. Where else so you get lines like 'I am not a witch, I'm your wife' or 'No more rhymes I mean it, would anybody like a peanut?'  And for fans of Princess Bride, I also recommend Labrynth.",Null,1,2,16 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Too much for me
","Saving Private Ryan was a little to intense for my tastes, maybe I enjoy the sugar coating a little too much.  It was an excellent movie, I just could not handle the harshness of it.  After seeing it I was unable to sleep because I was so upset.  I realize that it was very close to an accurate representation of the war, but I would rather avoid exposing myself to something as disturbing as the opening scene for my own sanity.  The plot was intelligent and honest though extremely disheartening.",5,1,2,16 October 1999
A Bug's Life," Look I am a beautiful butterfly
","I love this movie.  I am actually watching it right now.  The characters have so much Personality.  I could watch it a zillion times and never tire of it.  The voice casting was impeckable.  It is one of the wittiest children's movies ever.  The takes at the end seal the deal, I laugh uncontrollably every time I watch them.",Null,0,0,16 October 1999
Jaws," a masterpiece
","Any movie that can scare as many people for so long has definatley earned the place Jaws has in the vast sea of movies.  I first saw this movie as a young child, and being an impressionable young child with mean older brothers, I was afraid of even tap water for months.  In attempt to reduce my fear, my mother told me Jaws was the size of the swimming pool at the YMCA, and I have not swam there since.  I appreciate the movie on an entirely different level now, but I am still in awe at it's pure genius. The fear that the shark induces will never fade in my eyes, I will never grow out of that.  But I have learned to appreciate the characters, dialogue, and depth that Jaws offers.  Rarely does an action film give you a chance to analyze the characters more in depth than face value, but the characters in Jaws are presented as complex, complete people.  I can't wait to go watch it again.",10,2,4,16 October 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," One of my favorites
","This movie was amazing in so many ways.  Rarely do movies based on books do the book justice, but the movie was inanely accurate.  The casting was flawless and the actors could not have done better.  I don't think the phrase 'Brooks was here' will ever leave my subconscious.  Every character has so much depth to offer the viewer, it is an amazing look at the human race.  Certainly not a movie to take light-heartedly.",Null,0,0,15 October 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," creepy
","I have not watched this movie since it came out when I was 11, so I am sure if I saw it today, my opinion might change.  I enjoyed the plot, but I remember the movie being really gruesome.  I also fell in love with the actress Jodie Foster from her role in the movie.  She is a tremendous actress.  Sir Anthony Hopkins did a great job as well, especially with his haunting last line.  I think I need to see the movie again though, in order to do it justice with a detailed commentary.",8,0,0,5 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," I am still amazed
","I can hardly express how wonderful this movie is.  I was honestly terrified through most of the movie.  I saw it during it's first week at the theater, and I am still raving about it to everyone who will listen.  The casting and acting are superb, the plot is genius, and the sound is perfect.  Anyone who has yet to see it, go now.  Seeing it bigscreen really adds to everything about the movie.",10,0,0,16 October 1999
