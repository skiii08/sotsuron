The King's Speech," Empathy, so much empathy
","Two things which lured me to the theater were the cast and the genre: the rare case of a biography with the elements of comedy, my top favorite among comedies. Two things that made the movie memorable were the reconstruction of the time period with a rather modern insight and the close bond with the main character, it really felt like being there and then.This movie is a touching drama with a lovely humor, but can be a really scary catastrophe thriller for anyone who has any kind of speech impediment, stage fright or other problem with public speaking. The emotions you get before an exam or a public presentation will be back on you in the theater. Oh, the horror! Bertie, do you want a hug?I really appreciate how the main characters were portrayed; it was easy to see their strong and weak points, their fears and ambitions. Helena Bonham Carter was the Dutchess/Queen with class but also with nerve, and the two leading actors created a warm and strong married couple. Geoffrey Rush showed us Lionel Logue as a clever man with the greatest empathy, who was also very much ahead of his era with the approach to the therapy.It was interesting to see the society in which mass media, public relations and personal life coaches would seem much of a novelty, but apparently it was already coming. I liked the way the movie showed good and bad sides of monarchy, both for the members of the royal family and for the nation (er... Empire).It was a memorable movie certainly worth watching even if due to the emotional bond with King George it makes you feel like having a cigarette, pronouncing random dirty words and becoming a Colin Firth fan-girl forever more.",9,0,0,7 March 2011
Coraline," So why are beetroots better than flowers? Great potential and lots of room for improvement.
","As a great admirer of doll animation I was fascinated and impressed by the amount of work the creators of the movie has put into it. A close look at the clothes, interiors and the enchanted flowers was like appreciating a piece of art. It applied to everything but the characters, which seemed to be way too sharp-edged, their proportions were too disturbed and often the general impression too grotesque as compared to classic animation.After reading a brief synopsis, no to mention the book, you already know the whole story. Real life and real people seem so dull and cold and the other world seems so luring, until it becomes a real nightmare.Having fought the evil witch and destroyed the illusion of the other world Coraline learns to appreciate her real family and neighbors. However, I don't see how the change in the characters did take place. Coraline shows more affection towards her parents simply because she missed them and they at least don't want to kill her or sew buttons on her face. The parents seem more cheerful and less distant than at the beginning of the movie, but not because of the adventure. They don't remember anything that happened in the other world, they simply feel relaxed and optimistic because they have completed their job that had kept them busy. Could that be a permanent change? Was the witch gone forever after the spider-needle-hand was tossed into the well?The story doesn't justify how the real world transformed from really unfriendly (ice-cold parents, disturbed neighbors) to fairly normal. It is disappointing because I expected a real allegory of repairing family relations and mirroring of the real world in the other world not only by the looks but by the course of events (somewhat like in 'The Pan's Labyrinth').Another big doubt about the movie is the age of a target audience. It is way too creepy for little children, but not challenging enough to grasp teenagers' and adults' attention.A real beetroot is better for you than an illusion of a flower, yet I'm not sure if it was exactly what this symbol stood for. Maybe it wasn't symbolic at all. The movie is without doubt memorable, but I'd rather have a little more beetroot than flower in it i.e. more story over the picture.",6,1,3,29 March 2010
Madagascar," Very unentertaining excuse for a family movie
","I really like animated adventures and comedies. I sometimes even go out them in a company of equally adult people and if not I just wait for the movies to be aired on TV. Since the adult people told me to see 'Madagascar' because 'thre are lemurs who like to move it, move it', I watched it.The first thing that hit me was the general unfriendliness of the movie. It is obviously the fault of Disney that I've got used to really pretty and cuddly animal characters and subtle intelligent dialog and couldn't appreciate the sharp-edged caricatures of animals and forced unfunny slang. Of course I judge the language only by the Polish dubbed version, but I'm sure that if the original dialog were decent, the Polish producers wouldn't provide a translation that sounds neither smart nor polite. I may be speaking a bit too much like a teacher now, but I believe that even the funniest entertainment for children should have some intellectually stimulating element instead of pumping utterly dumb and not even funny 'humor' into children's heads.The second major disadvantage is the lack of the plot. The animals escape from the ZOO and arrive at Madagascar. End of the story. There are some obstacles on the way, the famous penguin sub-plot, dancing lemurs and the lion's moral conflict, but all of that together don't really form a story.Let me analyze now the moral conflict of the lion and explain why I find this movie really disgusting.Every child, unless brought up by vegans, experiences this moment when he/she fully understands that meat comes from animals and accepts it by the law of nature. Again, Disney brings back the memory of the Lion King's Circle of Life with its deep and almost philosophical message. There must be something meaningful in the movies and stories about talking animals. They can either present the laws of nature (animals act like animals) or serve as an allegory of human society (animals act like people) and a child's mind is perfectly able to work in these two worlds. But the conflict presented in 'Madagascar' works in neither.It shows the lion's natural instinct of eating animal flesh as something immoral and sick that can be overcome by friendship, forgiveness and some sort of therapy. Unless that instinct is an allegory of alcoholism or domestic violence, it is all totally wrong. Lions and other carnivores cannot stop eating meat using their good will and it is something children shouldn't be tricked into believing. Of course there are cartoons in which cats and aardvarks go to school and eat apple pie, but then they don't want to eat their neighbors and friends, just like it is common in the human society, excluding concentration camps and planes crashed on the iceberg.If I were little when I watched 'Madagascar' the image of a zebra and lemurs turning into steaks would have given me a reason not to sleep at night. And the scene with the lion biting the zebra's butt is not funny at all. I don't know how it was supposed to be humorous in any way, if what he wanted was to feed on his flesh, injure him and probably kill. Maybe some people find it funny just because it was the butt and nothing bad happened after all.The solution to the lion's moral conflict is eating fish. 'Fish instead of meat' is an unrealistic change of eating habits in animal world and doesn't represent any consistent ethics in the human society (apart of some religious fasting or some sort of unsaturated fat diet). It may be a sigh of relief for kids who cared about the characters in the movie, but it doesn't help them develop any useful attitude towards real life animals with this false belief that laws of nature can be changed. I can also hear with my mind's ear some vegans arguing that 'a fish has the same right to live as a zebra!'.But that's all about meat and upbringing. But what people - adults and young ones - liked the most were the penguins and the song. The problem is that when the minor characters steal the show it means the movie wasn't very well constructed. And the song wasn't an original one, it's in fact a well known piece, which by being associated with 'Madagascar' brought the movie extra popularity.The swinging lemur, who likes to move it, move it, however, is something very special. Silly and powerful, vain and insane - I'm taking King Julien out of this movie with his bigger crown with a gecko on it to adore him in peace.Apart from the penguins and King Julien there's absolutely nothing enjoyable in this movie and with its perverted ethics and poor dialog I rate is as unsuitable for the audiences of any age.1/10 +1 for King Julien.",2,2,5,6 April 2010
The Last Legion," Imperialistic, naive, inaccurate, cute and therefore insanely funny.
","Oh, dear. It's a really bad movie, but still worth watching, even for laughs (or for unshaven Colin Firth).I swear I was told it is an 'epic historical drama'. By my sense, it is just a little less historically accurate than 'Asterix in Britain'. Why didn't they go for a full fantasy picture, but only used style of filming typical for fantasy movies and pretended to be using historical setting? Maybe that's how you could film a legend.Legends, however, most of all show how certain people today want to define their identity. By this interpretation of the Arthurian legend Britain apparently says: 'we, the British, have the true spirit of Roman soldiers, and totally so do Black and Hindu people under our rule.' I'm not sure if it's plain imperialism or just political correctness gone wrong and whether I should laugh (well, I did almost every time I saw that fat African-American dude among the Roman legionaries) or just get sick (it's a modern movie, do people really think that way?). I think Firth's many roles as an upper-class English gentleman contribute to this picture.There are many things that didn't make sense neither historically nor within the plot. It's hard to say whether the creators of the movie were ignorant or rather purposefully wanted to show their beliefs and values regardless of the general knowledge. I'm not going to list every detail, but surely the better you know history, the louder you'll laugh.Putting the confusing overtones and nonsensical settings aside, it is an enjoyable adventure with some funny moments and moving hugs. The movie is also family-friendly, because there is nothing inappropriate except sword fights. And even though Aishwarya Rai looks gorgeous, there's no chemistry between the male and female protagonists, the romance is implied just because they are the male and female protagonists. The implication is so weak, that I (an imaginative adult) honestly though they lied on the bed together because it was cold.My guess about the target audience was perfect. Within IMDb demographics the movie is rated the highest by Males under 18 (action-adventure plot with a sophistication of the last decade's PC game) and Females over 45 (sincerly, Colin Firth has never looked so manly in any other movie). Doesn't it speak volumes?I must have really overrated the movie with 4 stars, but at least I had a good laugh and didn't get bored. Also, there was the moon shown twice in different phases, which is the most rare things in movies (in almost all cases it is only the full moon which is the proper hint that it is night) and that excuses the poorly digitally pasted backgrounds in view scenes and saves a star.Dear me, I still can't stop laughing. Maybe re-reading some fragments from a history book and re-watching 'Mamma Mia!' will help me restore sanity.And if there is any new movie about Spartans, Vikings and Ninjas coming out, make sure Colin Firth is in it.

The Pianist," Unexplained cruelty, a non-character and very many fascinating wooden cupboards.
","What do you normally expect from a biographical movie about a musician during the World War II and the persecution of Jews? Probably a character who is either likable or non-stereotypical hence interesting, lots of good music, some historical hints for dummies and varied social background. Apparently 'The Pianist' doesn't give you too much of any of these.First of all, there is no plot strictly speaking, but a sequence of events in which the main character is involved. The war starts, people get killed, the uprisings break out, the Russians come, the war ends and all the time Szpilman is barely an observer, apart from the threat of being shot or sent to a death camp the history doesn't shape our 'hero', nor does he change anything in it. He doesn't fight nor support the fighting civilians, he doesn't save anyone, he barely helps his fellows. His proceedings through the war times are likely to be less interesting than those of any randomly picked war survivor.I cannot judge the real Szpilman and his life, but I could imagine him being less dull and passive than the character in the movie. Szpilman created by Brody doesn't seem to be a musical genius, but rather a self-centered average person. He is awkward and naive in a non-charming way. There is no depth to the character and he doesn't form any relationships with others apart from expecting help. With this help he moves from one apartment to another and stares blankly at the cupboards. I realize that food shortage was a big issue during the war, but how many cupboard examinations can you put in one movie?It's not like I dislike cupboards. In fact I find the decorations and choice of items to be the strongest point of the movie, some very realistic and nicely designed reconstructions. Although interiors and costumes often look too clean and too smart, it is nevertheless a good job done.The reconstruction of the society doesn't work that well. All the Poles plus one Nazi soldier are nice and helpful, all the Nazis plus one Polish neighbor are mean, Soviets are the victorious heroes who bring peace to Poles and Jews. It's a very simple division more typical of a movie from the '60s than a modern one. Besides, even though the main focus is on the Jews, the movie doesn't seem to have any really Jewish elements. Where is the Jewish religion and spirituality, Jewish music and Jewish wit? Of course living in a ghetto makes people lose heart but it doesn't mean there is no need for some characteristics to be shown in the movie.There's absolutely nothing said about the reasons of the war actions. The war is like an unstoppable natural disaster from which you can only hide, but not an international conflict in which the orders come from and are executed by real people. The Nazis simply came to kill both Poles and Jews though the latter with more monstrous pleasure. The scenes are explicit, not suitable for children and sensitive adults. Death doesn't seem to have any meaning in this movie. If so, then without any disrespect to the real Szpilman, why would we want him in particular to survive, while so many others were starved to death, shot in the head or thrown out of a window?I can only recommend this movie to people who cannot tell apart the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from the Warsaw Uprising - there are dates on the screen to help you remember; and anyone who likes cupboards.I don't recommend this movie to people who like action, multi-linear plot, well developed characters, dislike shallow good vs. evil division and showing more blood than necessary.",3,4,12,13 April 2010
Alice in Wonderland," A story lacking meaning and absurdity at once.
","When I first heard that Tim Burton and a whole squadron of actors I've already loved in other films are working on their version of 'Alice' I was thrilled. Especially because I've read Tim Burton's poetry and I thought that if he and Lewis Carrol lived in the same era they would just love to spend time together telling each other unbelievable stories while having tea and oysters. Needless to say I was wrong.The first question that comes to my mind is in what era the minds of the creators of this movie got stuck. A story about emancipation would have been big in the 1960s, while a story about a young person slaying a dragon would have become cult among teenagers in the 1980s. Yet we are in the year 2010, when the visual effects developed much, but the poor storyline is far less innovative that the books which became famous over a century ago.The visual effects, however, are no big argument in favor of the movie. It could have been the theater's fault, the angle or just my eyes, but in many places the picture seemed out of focus or with low contrast and there were no breathtaking 3D effects. So the pleasure of seeing it in 3D didn't make up for the weird adaptation as it happened in the case of 'Beowulf'.Lewis Carrol's books hasn't become popular because of their plot, but because of playing with logic, illustrating the literal meaning of conventional phrases with nonsensical situations and bringing the characters from proverbs and nursery rhymes to life. These creatures had all the right to act illogically, because they were nothing but meaningless words trying to become real in Alice's dream. Tim Burton's movie did have a plot, which was unfortunately the most banal one - the title character has to accomplish a quest because apparently no one else can. All the minor characters for some reason have got new names, but not a bit of personality.Certain situations could seem repetitive for a person who had read the books or seen any of the earlier 'Alice' movies, yet I imagine it would be difficult to understand the movie without having any previous 'Alice' experience. I would recommend knowing the 'Jabberwocky' poem by heart just to be able to grasp all the nonexistent words that appear in the movie and to know why they are there at all.Since we are faced with a simple plot and flat characters we should be able to recognize their motives and goals. In fact we can only draw the conclusions that the Red Queen is evil and she shall not rule the land because she shouts a lot, the White Queen is good and she shall rule the land because she is pretty, and only Alice and no one else but Alice shall slay the dragon because... well, because! Frankly speaking I fail to see any more reason behind Alice's quest. The division into good and evil is being forced upon us without proper argumentation. Since it is no longer an adventure of a child but of a young adult we could have expected that the story and the world would be more complex and intellectually challenging, yet we face the exact opposite - everything has been painfully simplified.The final questions are: what did the director want to tell us through this picture? What have our heroine achieved and learned during her adventure? Has Alice learned that she doesn't have to obey all the rules of the real world and rather be herself? I'm sorry to say, but such a movie was made in 1999 (the one in which Whoopi Goldberg played the Cat). Has Alice found out that she can be smart and independent? This role was not convincing enough when it comes to these two traits. Or is the message of the movie that we shall be imaginative because we can make good money of it? That's exactly what Alice's father believed and also what I think Alice and the creators of the movie have really understood.",4,7,14,27 March 2010
Beowulf," Works well for me... as a parody.
","The 3D glasses and a group of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture enthusiast really made me enjoy the movie. The arrows were flinging, the coins were showering, the branches poked my face and while other people laughed only at the weak sex-related jokes we laughed at every change of the original story and every cheesy bit of dialog, so in fact all the time.To make it clear to all of you who are not that much into history of literature: Beowulf was most probably written by an Anglo-Saxon poet-monk in England about the pagan heroes from somewhere about today's Denmark/Sweden. I imagine he just loved the simple legend about a fight of good vs. evil so he adapted it and skilfully imputed that it was the good God who help the good-willing pagans to fight the evil monsters even though they didn't know Him. It was written in a beautiful style and was appreciated by numerous generations.Contemporary world, however, seems not to be a place for heroes anymore. People go through moral and psychological struggles, the monsters that we fear are not outside, they are in us. However, making the characters the monsters' fathers in the most literal sense is a bit of overdoing in showing this.For the creators of the movie the ideas of good and evil were not attractive at all. It looks as if they tried really hard to make a point against Christianity even though it didn't fit the historical settings at all.Putting an actual date at the beginning made a funny pseudo-historical introduction. The Dark Ages are dark, but then you have late medieval strongholds and renaissance music. Pretty indeed, but pure nonsense, just like Angelina's Old English. She pronounced it perfectly, so did Gollum, er, Grendel, but it's most illogical! Everyone speaks modern English and the monsters apparently Old English. I would guess that the characters spoke Norse and West Germanic dialects and monsters didn't speak at all, because they were monsters, not golden Lara Croft with stiletto shoes and her bastard son. Only our poet-monk spoke Old English, but if the whole movie was in Old English with subs it would have been awesome.The movie rather looked and sounded pleasant and the 3D was entertaining. The humans were a bit doll-like and there were a lot of idiotic ways to 'cover' their private parts. The panoramas were beautiful, though mountains and stone walls don't do justice to the original swamps and woodwork of the times and place given.Apart from lack of consistency in recreating the settings and atmosphere of the Dark Ages it is mainly the change of the whole story and turning the back on the very idea of a hero that makes me so critical about this movie. We really need to hear a legend about a good hero who kills an evil monster from time to time to have the strength to deal with our inner struggles. The creators of the movie wanted to outsmart it and made something hysterically funny instead.I give as much as 4/10 since 2 is for a movie that I managed to watch at all, +1 for pretty visuals and 3D effects, +1 for hilarious anachronisms and Angelina :)",4,0,2,2 July 2010
Happy Feet," Very illogical if not offensive movie which might make me hate penguins.
","'Haters will hate!', 'Haters are conservative!', 'Haters don't see it is a funny movie for kiddos!'.Hello, I'm a hater, nice to meet you! I don't generally hate children's movies and literature. I find most of them great fun for both grown-ups and little ones. But this can be only achieved when the movie offers fun and action with a bit of education to the kids and something to move the adults or make them think. This movie offers nothing but very illogical 'teaching' about environment for the children and sex jokes for the adults. Besides, call me whatever names, but I assure you, children to some extent do tell dry-humping from 'playing' or 'dancing'. Even to think such content is all what we expect from a family movie is offensive to the intellect of any age group.I finally decided to give this picture 2 stars, for I appreciate the way they animated sea and sky and all the work on choreography, but the plot, characters and dialogs deserve minus rating.If I had this silly habit of talking to myself, I would have whispered 'What?', 'Why?' and 'Excuse me!' quite often.The major failure is the clash of anthropomorphic animals with actual humans. For me it worked in 'Ice Age', scored a weak pass in 'Ratatouille' and hit the very bottom here. If there are actual humans in the movie (of one kind), why are there different human ethnicities, cultures and religions mapped on the penguins? It is so illogical that it hurts. And it's also closer to offensive (stereotypes) than liberal (variety). Also, the allusions to religion are very much biased, since the leaders are portrayed as dumb, selfish and forbidding others from having fun and being themselves.It is unbelievably ironic that this production won an Oscar over 'Cars', which had no religious themes (thanks God!), but taught that there is something else in life than our personal goals that it is worth to slow down for and that the old ones have their story to tell and deserve respect and friendship. Ewww, so 'conservative'! Now I see clearly the spirit of the filmmakers and critics in general.As for the 'educative' part about saving environment and endangered species on our planet the story was also illogical and didn't lead me to expected conclusions 'we should be aware and caring'. Instead it filled my head with a bunch of ridiculous thoughts and associations.If I had just discovered that there exists a colony of penguins with near-human intelligence attempting to communicate with our species I would advocate a long-term research on their abilities and tried to create and artificial language of communication between them and us. That would surely change a lot more in our study of nature than simply giving up fishing.It's quite sad and unfair to make children believe that politicians or entrepreneurs will change anything because animals can 'tell' them something. To push my train of thought yet a bit more off the rail, all animals need the resources we are using (water, food, forest). It is such a serious and heartbreaking issue that it's the high time for us as the human race to commit a mass suicide, so that aliens could carry our souls out of this Earth and we would leave it all to the animals who tap and sing Gospel songs about mating.Sarcasm over.
