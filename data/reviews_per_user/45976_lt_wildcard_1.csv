Requiem for a Dream," Best reality-punch film I have seen, probably ever
","This movie simply has turned my perspective on how, why, and what reasons lie behind making a movie.  The brutal honesty of this movie, I cannot remember having seen before.  And even though one could argue over the point of the movie and the plot details, I believe most all would have to say that it hides nothing from the audience in the way of all the good things humans have to offer, all that they want in their life and the lives of others, and how either gradually over time or in the blink of an eye, it can all be swept away...and the brutal honesty and reality that is their own lives surfaces and shines through.  Everyone thinks that if they just ARE good people and live life and BE good people that they SHOULD and WILL get what they and others feel they deserve.  But as anyone who has ran across their own failures and fallibilities in their own lives can tell you, that is not always the case, and the story doesn't always have a happy ending, even if there are not any bad guys to readily blame or condemn for the tragedies that befall even the most unassuming of people.  Thus my claim for reality-punch....this movie acted as a reality punch for myself and I'm sure it would, or could I should say for anybody else who were to watch this movie, uninterrupted, from beginning to end.",7,0,0,21 January 2003
