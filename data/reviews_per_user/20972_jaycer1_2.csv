Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All that was expected. Nothing more. Whih is good, not great.
","Was there any one who wasn't a kid in the 70's who did NOT see any of the original 'Star Wars'? When Episode I came, it stirred oh-so-many memories in my mind. But...I want to make something clear. This is NOT a bad movie, as many of my so-called friends sometimes call it. Au contraire, this movie ROCKS. It follows the story of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his mentor, Qui-gon Jinn, to free the planet Naboo from the greedy Trade Federation's blockade, unknowing that a much darker purpose and power is under the blockade. In escaping the planet with the exiled and blumbering gunga Jar Jar Binks, they land in the planet Tatooine, where Qui-gon finds the young Anakin Skywalker, a young boy who shows signs of great Jedi abilities. (Yes, I know this sounds alot like the plot summary published on the page, but hey, I'm not in the creative mood today).The effects are simply breath-taking, and there are scenes and even major characters that are only CGI  (by the way, I am one of the three or five persons who actually find Jar Jar Binks funny). And the main villain, Darth Maul, rapidly took Boba Fett's place in my list of coolest Star Wars character, even though (SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT) he has the lamest death scene in film history. And here comes the big 'but'. In 'Episode I', the greatest attractive is the origin of the story and the cool effects (which are sure to give 'The Matrix' a run for the money at the Academy Awards). In all the other Star Wars, the mythology, story, characters AND special effects are the attractives. There isn't enough character depth or much of a plot line in 'Phantom'. The movie gives what was promised, but that was it. No surprises. I think the 'Newsweek' critic said it best when he said 'the movie was everything I expected and nothing I hoped for'. I wouldn't go that far, but it's close enough.Oh, well. Let's see what happens in 'Episode II'.",7,0,0,23 March 2000
Man on the Moon," Man on The Moon, indeed.
","'Man on The Moon', indeed. I remember seeing Andy Kaufman's act on TV as a teenager, and I admit, I wrote him off as another comedian, with an incredibly expressive face and a flair for silliness. Years later, I'm watching him on 'Taxi' reruns. I admired the easiness where he could go from loving Latka to malicious Vic with ease, and I thought, 'Wow, this guy really loves what he does'. And then I watch 'Man on The Moon'. Reality check.This picture, I believe, redeems Andy Kaufman. He endured five grueling years in 'Taxi' just so he could get some laughs out of people. He did wrestling stints just for the heck of it. He came real close of hitting rock bottom just to save himself at the end. He died of cancer at the age of 35, ridiculously young, and even then his own family didn't buy it. He lived misunderstood, and died misunderstood. And years later, he gets a biopic. Just what he deserves. It is sad that many people will know Andy's talent and understand him only after watching this film. But still, let's face it, at the end he did get the last laugh.The true cornerstone in this film is Jim Carrey. Yes, you've heard endless reviews about him immersing himself into Andy, not just playing him. But this is acting beyond your dreams, trust me. Especially when he plays Andy's foreign character, Carrey lived and breathed Kaufman air. This is the movie where his silly-putty face comes handy, as it seems to help Jim turn into Andy. (If only we could do something about those teeth...) NEWSFLASH FOR THE ACADEMY: Jim Carrey can act!!! I remember Tom Hanks beginning with the same kind of movies that Jim did: loud, colorful, goofy and silly (films like 'Bachelor Party' come to mind). Then he did 'Big', then came 'Philadelphia'. When is Carrey's 'Philadelphia' coming along? I can't wait to see him at the Academy Awards this year.Man on the moon, indeed.",8,126,149,2 March 2000
