Hereditary," Biggest letdown of the season
","I had high hopes for this movie and unfortunately those hopes were never realized. The film takes you along a slow moving plot that builds with intensity and an ever increasing sense of dread. The biggest letdown of the film is not only the dreadful way it attempts to tie up the story, but the biggest thrill is the awful clicking noise the actors make with their tongues. In a way this movie feels like a James Wan production, mixed with some M. Night Shamalan for the plot twist (if you can call it that). Overall a huge letdown. I would skip this one.",4,4,9,11 June 2018
