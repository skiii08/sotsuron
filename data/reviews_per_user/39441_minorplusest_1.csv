Skyfall," What does everyone expect of a James Bond movie?
","For me its fun to see any James Bond movie, mostly because I have no other expectation but to be entertained, the James Bond character is just fun to follow ... its somehow hard to understand why so many people react like if James Bond where ... I don't know: father?, lover?, alter-ego?.Well, that parked aside, Skyfall is a fun movie to watch if you want to be entertained.The main cast (Craig, Dench & Barden) does a fine job. New comers will have to work hard to gain their place in the franchise (no names to avoid spoilers). The plot have some serious holes, but well, that is part of the 007 franchise too. The entire checklist is filled: opening action sequence, nice girls, semi-exotic locations, the bad guy, the martini ... well, you know it. Additions to this movie are some nostalgia and tears (think I've only see those in Lazenby's Bond). With such a large list of 'needs to be in the film' elements I think Sam Mendes does an elegant job mixing them together, and if the movie is a bit long, is just that he needed time to add the differentiator content.Skyfall is just another fun James Bond movie to watch ... probably because Goldfinger did not change my life, nor Moonraker is the worst movie I've seen. Grab some popcorn and enjoy! thats what James Bond is all about.",10,2,11,5 November 2012
