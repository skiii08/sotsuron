Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Horrible with no Will Turner, Elizabeth, or a proper villain
","Don't know where they got off making a cheap lame movie like this, but all the characters suck. Jack just looks like he's doing the same stuff from the first movie but more cheaply. Not to mention that what he does in this movie, is really not even cool. The stunts seemed lamer and his whole character is just poorly done. And even if, you can't focus a whole plot just around Jack, that's just STUPID.And I know this counts as critique for the previous movie, the third one (At World's End)...but no Norrington or Governor Swann is really not the same movie. I never really liked Beckett's character too. So all that from the third and second movie screwed up this one. Leaving you with just a Jack Sparrow who doesn't even look like he's into the movie acting-wise. No Elizabeth? No Will? Sure the ending of the third one made it so you couldn't have more Will, but if it's saying the third one's ending sucks then so be it. Will should be in EVERY Pirates movie. Same with his little bonnie lass.Overall this movie is annoying with Penelope Cruz, a highly unfit character for any big movie, she should just stay in the cheap Loreal commercials. Don't know how she got to be big. This director must be a real idiot. Blackbeard is lame too, the whole mermaid siren thing is kind of cool but just wasn't fun enough to sustain a plot. Blackbeard looked and functioned like a two year old's pirate character, like Captain Hook from Peter Pan or something (no offense to people who like Peter Pan). Where's the cool people like Bosun? Raggetti? Black Beard was annoying, boring, and HORRIBLE to watch on screen...nothing but a big embarrassment. The whole 'my father is mean' Blackbeard plot is redundant and not Pirates material. Not to mention it's a cheap ripoff of other movies too.You can't just bring Gibbs in, because honestly even Gibbs seemed off. The other members of the Black Pearl can't be just tagging along for the ride as well. I don't remember if Tia Dalma was in it. But everyone lacked the Pirates charm.0/10",1,2,3,4 August 2016
Terminator Salvation," No Arnold Schwarzenegger. Therefore, it sucks.
","That's right. You heard me. They made a Terminator movie without Arnold. YES, it could have been done, if you look back at the other Terminator movies there's nothing that says Terminator has to be about Arnold, especially the first one. But for sake of pure cult movie tradition, fans wanted to see ARNOLD. WE WANT ARNOLD.Not some lamos the whole movie. The movie may as well have been named American Army Movie 4. It's just about lame armies that talk too much in a boring way, we want to see bulletholes in cars and Arnold bikeriding. One hand shotgun shooting, the black glasses, the bodybuilder in black leather, THAT'S TERMINATOR MAN. And the movie reeks of an annoying CSI 2010 era, it doesn't have the cool laid back 1990s feel of the other ones where it feels like it's the time of cool dudes with guns. There were no cooldudes here.The story sure can pass as something interesting, but the fact most people didn't see it because Arnold wasn't in it proves that it sucks still nonetheless. I'm not going to lie, you will be actually kind of drawn in when you sit there and watch it. If you can follow it. But without Schwarzenegger, it isn't a story. It's some googleplex Einstein complicated storyline where you have to listen more than you should.Filled with lame romance and lame acting, I don't really get at all what Sam Worthington's character was in it for. Makes no sense to me. Completely random tacked on character. Kyle Reese looked like a pansy, John Connor is more annoying than anything (and no, I'm not hating Christian Bale for his anger episode with that camera guy that was leaked on the net, this is separate) because he behaves too much like a 2010 'policeman' who thinks hes in CSI or Law and Order. We want to see all black wearing sunglasses guys shooting each other, not the friggin police. John is supposed to be a cool Terminator kid from the nineteen eighties.What's with this garbage movie? It's like they didn't get Terminator at all.",1,0,11,30 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 11/10, a must see!
","Personally I've never gotten this whole '1 2 and 3, 4 5 and 6 wahwahwah' separation business. Where someone will split it into this 'prequel trilogy sequel trilogy' crapola and make enemies with episodes 1 2 and 3. And plus, I think prequel is wrong English anyway because prequel means before the FIRST one I believe. It can't englishally be before the 4th one, it has to be before the 1st (like negative numbers). They're all phenomenal and if you don't want to read the rest just read this line: that Star Wars Episode II (2) is easily one of the best in the entire sixtilogy. But they all are at the end of the day.Anyway, I'm not saying if you've seen the movie billions of times you're going to be as thrilled the billion & one'th time, as many old watchers get blanded out at every movie saying 'yeah he flipped over the thing so what, oh he fought the bad guy, movies are all the same...' This movie is for your prime in life when you're young and kicking. You've got to have the fresh perspective of the 1990s, where everything is gold. I personally get a bit yawny when I watch ANYTHING now because I saw it all too much as a kid LOL.That aside, the movie is flawless. The only MINOR mistakes to note are that there wasn't enough lightsaber on lightsaber candy. But again, that's because I want more after seeing it thousands of times. Everything else is good. Music is good, Story is amazing, flow is perfect, acting is actually phenomenal (I'd like to see you random fat angry hater people act out Anakin without sounding like a complete nerd). People hated this movie for no reason. Poor them, they missed out on one of the greatest cinema masterpieces of the world. Great action, still waters my mouth to this day. Surprisingly good dialogue.But careful, some scenes can induce nightmares! If your kids don't know how to get into 90s' style movies then they'll sit there blankly not getting it (and hence they won't get scared probably). BUT, if they know how to watch movies (the open way), then they may get scared a bit. But it's okay, it all evens out.11/10! Easily one of the best of all 6.",10,4,7,15 July 2016
Inside Out," Maybe the IDEA is not bad, but the movie is a disgrace
","I don't really side with the reviewers that say the idea of a movie like this would be lame. Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives?If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term 'plastic'). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU.She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you.This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material.Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The 'emotion' characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole 'I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents' thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know.You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie. There's so many adult themes I've left out. Trying to turn our beautiful wide eyed hyper children into antisocial desk clerk emotion hormone teens that don't talk to their Mommy and Daddy anymore. My kids were never like this.-99999/10!",1,91,189,25 July 2016
Batman Begins," Epic. Amazing. PERFECTION
","This movie just kicked **** totally. Amazing. The only flaws I can think of are minute things that aren't really more than eyecandy issues. Slight imperfections in the candy factor of the movie.I think maybe Scarecrow could have got more of a finale, I think maybe some of the cinematography in fight scenes could have been a bit easier on the eyes, but it did it's desired effect though. Can't deny the fighting was amazing. Music was amazing, acting was amazing, script was amazing.Unfortunately let down by lame Dark Knight and even lamer Dark Knight Rises, but you never know what's in store in the future.1235153463711457456145747152361/10.",10,2,3,28 July 2016
Jurassic World," LOL it's not even comparable to the garbage out on your lawn
","Literally I think I could plug in some cables into a old piece of paper that annoyingly blew its way onto your property or a dirty moldy pop can and have more fun trying to play that than endure this painful movie.I was feeling all kinds of things like leg cramps, leg dryness (hard to explain what that is, it's not a skin thing), lack of blood flow in me, dizzy feelings that tingle in the thigh when I was watching this. It's like, imagine you have a flow of energy in a circuit. If you like disrupt it, then the flow doesn't work right? We have a flow that is satisfied by the movies we watch, and when that flow SUCKS, our bodies begin to shut down because they're not working circuits. Your legs keep fidgeting because you're bored, your breathing becomes difficult, all in all it felt crap to see this. Makes me wonder if you can even hold them responsible for making such atrocious cinema, because seriously I even had stomach problems after seeing it.Or maybe that's because I see too much Jurassic Park in youth and was let down so I got like sick or something...but anyway! Know that I'm one of the biggest fans ever to exist of Jurassic Park. I had all the cool toys, everything. Charts showing the dinosaur sizes, video games, and all from the cool era back then. None of this J world filth. Real old school Lost World and JP3 stuff. So if there were anyone to have review this movie, it's me (and of course the other fans out there too).It sucked right from beginning to end, the dinosaurs are reduced to annoying playthings, like literally it's not like 'oh that raptor is scary', it's more like 'that raptor is annoying, like that kid who keeps going number two on your lawn'. It all reeks of annoying things. It's sad, it's not even like it's disturbing like Saw or Texas Chainsaw Massacre or something, it's just annoying.Dinos are not these creatures you can turn into graphic barbie showcase things with the ugly kids riding them and ugly kids going to see them in a park. They're noble beings, full of power and majesty. LISTEN TO JOHN HAMMOND AND MALCOLM IN THE 2ND MOVIE FOR Christ SAKES, the creatures need our ABSENCE, and that includes the makers in our world that try to make (*cough* steal 1990's filmmakers ideas) stories and CG models out of them. They all look like they've been animated by selfish people, a loving CG artist makes even the cruddiest of 3D modelia shine with life. It's just a matter of a simple loving touch, that's what makes CG great (I know from some experience with CG). This movie had none of that. So sorry, the dinosaurs don't make you drool with immense urges to draw and colour them in all day, to have complex dioramas with your toys, it makes it worse than a street dog in your head. Just some 'oh look tommy, there's an annoying dino, go pet him'.Our dinos before had vicious survival based lives and they were as great as seeing your own mother and father when they came on screen. They marched in and ran the show, they were precious. The roars still fill my ears when I sleep at night.All the intro garbage crap with the kids and the dumb texting girlfriend nonsense, you put that in a kids movie? Seriously? That's when you know never to trust ANYTHING from this film company again, they're frauds. There was even a VERY big hint at a nude subject in the movie which I won't dare discuss. People are swearing left and right, like jeez you think the small words aren't swear words? You think our beloved Jurassic trilogy has language like that? You clearly don't know what a kid friendly movie is. Don't take your kids to see this, it's not worth it.The dinosaurs are all trying too hard to be cool, and YES I do treat the dinosaurs as their own creatures even through the screen because they were amazing enough to receive that treatment in the 3 movies. All the personifying of the dinos making them into more things for humans to control is annoying. Like a dinosaur movie isn't about them helping each other beat the bad dino like humans would, these makers are trying to make them like humans. These animals work alone and look like REAL animals when they think. YES, they can be friends but it has a different feel. It felt more like pixar creature love than anything. Complete disgrace to what keyboard and mouse is meant for. All the CG programs have been disgraced by this. The music blew too.-10000/10 if I could, but sadly 1 is the lowest rating the website permisses.",1,3,9,15 July 2016
The Dark Knight," A shameful disgrace to Batman Begins
","I really have to give this movie a low rating. I didn't want to at first, but I must. And here's why.The annoying recasting of actors didn't prove well, because the actors are very highly irritating and HORRIBLE at acting. Not to mention they look like really mean people. Plastics if you will, plastic being a term from Mean Girls (a Lindsay Lohan movie) if you've seen it. Every girl is a plastic in the movie. Rachel Dawes was recasted, I don't get why. You just killed half the movie by making it not about Christian Bale and Katie Holmes, but about MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL? What was the thought process? And recasting Scarecrow? Are you serious? It's not buyable as a Batman Begins sequel after you've taken those two out.And plus, this may anger the 'fans', but Heath Ledger really wasn't that good as the joker. And no, I am not a Jack Nicholson fanboy. He just wasn't good. Not to say if he tried again with the right guidance he wouldn't be good. He's just too normal to be honest. You think that he's so different, but all our kids from the 90s were like that. My dad used to be like that with me to make me laugh in the morning before school. I've seen peoples pets that are crazy like him. Although not violent of course, but what he got accredited for was the wide eyed psychopathic look, but it looks all normal if you ask me. I'm like that all the time. Well sort of anyway lol.Next? Well the movie is too much of a cop movie. Right off the bat (no pun intended) it didn't have a Batman Begins feel. Too much about rednecks trying to do the whole Law and Order storyline. Batman Begins was not about 'the police'. It was about seeing the ninjas, samurais, superheroes and stuff clobbering 50 million bad guys. NOT seeing the weak Gotham police force trying to solve crimes. The whole thing is about Batman just solving things, there was never an actual story. The first one was EPIC, there was actually a story to follow. This time around, it was storyless. Literally. You're just watching collections of different things happen, there's nothing connecting it. It's an episode of CSI, that's all.We had a beautiful martial artist Ducard in the first movie who was like Qui Gon Jinn in Star Wars, expertly trained. But this time we don't really get anything. All the fight choreography was lame. If you count him bending a gun as being 'choreography' then sadly you're mistaken, that's not much of a choreograph. It's just a cool feat to add into a scene, like sprinkles on ice cream. The cinematography for the fight scenes was just okay as well. Sure you could see more than in Batman Begins, but the fighting moves THEMSELVES sucked.The music was cool at least and sure, it had some good moments. But it's not really that good of a movie. Big disappointment.1/10!",1,6,19,25 July 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Lame. Lame lame lame lame lame. Christopher Nolan failed.
","I'm reluctant to ever trust this guy's movies ever again. But then again, it may not have even been him who made it I think. It just doesn't look like Christopher Nolan product. It looks like a high school project, or worse.To start off, the movie looks like it was honestly made by a 2 year old. Or someone who is as immature as one when it comes to the film industry. Cheap camera transitions, cheap scene transitions, cheap rehashes of scenes from other movies. The starting scene looked like NOTHING of Batman the Dark Knight (the 2nd movie in the trilogy) or Batman Begins let alone Batman itself. Looked like some other cheap American movie, I don't get where the thought process was for this. It jumps into random scenes out of the blue.The sequel has turned into some feel good soap opera drama movie, minus the feeling good part. Everyone seems to have an emotional sentence every few minutes, and I can't stand that. It jumps into drama whining lines randomly out of the blue.Plus not to mention that EVERYONE seems to take the spotlight of Bruce Wayne away, nobody wants to see 'the cops' 24/7 and Catwoman all day. The 'law enforcers' are all rude mean corrupt pricks and it's not about being a superhero clobbering 50 opponents like Batman Begins was. It's supposed to be about how the police take a BACK SEAT, there was actually a lame war of 'the police' officers charging. I literally held my face in my palm at that moment. We want to see Ninjas and Assassins, not the officers. That is NOT how batman works. The Justice League charges maybe, not the enforcement. I'm not trying to sound like a police hater, but we don't want to see mean people from our universe charging, we want Gondorians from Lord of the Rings and Samurai, Jedi Knights on Geonosis etc. League of Shadows is cool. Not cops. It's supposed to be about a man who is SEPARATE from muggles because he's trained to perfection. He's not a cop follower, and neither is Robin.It wouldn't even matter if you gave Bruce more spotlight anyway, because he's some lamo sad sop martyr in this movie. Way to make Batman into a complete pansy? What's the deal with that? We want to see BATMAN, it could have been deep to have him sad and then he returns but it wasn't done well. And realistically who he was in Batman Begins was a much tougher cooler character. He sounds like a whiney teen when he's having soap opera arguments with Alfred. Alfred was hardly in the movie as well.They really dumbed down the fight choreography a lot too. Just like in the Dark Knight (see my review on that movie for more info). So there goes your chance to at least get something cool of Bruce. All the cinematography for the fight scenes looks more amateurish and the fights are just lame and disturbing like Saw. He was better at fighting in Batman Begins. And that's just sad. (This is coming from someone who knows about the martial arts they used for the Batman Begins choreography)Bad acting relatively as well, especially Catwoman. Nothing cool about a character who treats people like dirt and is mean. That is NOT Catwoman, she's supposed to be SLY and CUNNING, she can be untrustworthy without being plain out spoilt and annoying. More of an annoyance than an actual cool character. Reflective of how a person from Hollywood might be outside of the movie. Tsk.So there's no swords, no cool ninja training scenes or demonstration of martial arts, just American redneck punching. What else you might ask? Well every villain is made to be lame, I won't spoil it but they ALL suck. Bane is more nightmare disturbing than he is a cool villain. It's like Jigsaw from Saw versus Jafar from Alladin. One is disturbing, one is actually cool and inspiring. Everyone who was following this movie years before it was announced knew that it was supposed to be the Riddler's spotlight. NOT Bane. And if so, Bane should have been CG'd to the max, being ripped completely. They did it in the PS3 games, so why not in the movie? And obviously Chris Nolan copied the video games Arkham Asylum and stuff (no one just comes up with Catwoman, Talia and Bane on their own) so it's not like he couldn't have made Bane muscular.Well that sums it up. Not fully, there's much more. But it sucks. All recycled music, recycled American movies, it looks like a shameful teen project. Good day.-999999/10",1,9,14,25 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Never saw it, -100000000 out of 10. Pitiful.
","Yeah say whatever you want about how if I didn't see it, I shouldn't be saying anything. Star Wars has won its glory through trailers, and these trailers all sucked. No one wants to see some collage of old movies rehashed into one cruddy work of film. Star Wars never was a copycat. I pray to GOD there isn't a sequel to this disaster. I've seen THE 6 movies and I'm not one of those people who separates it into 'prequel and sequel trilogy', they are all as one and equally perfect. That being said, let's continue.A lame villain, a lame set of main characters that don't provoke healthy things in our children (like apparently I heard in the first scene the African American male asks her if she has a boyfriend? Do I want my young star wars fanatic children hearing about 'boyfriends' at the theatre when they're not ready? No, so change the rating.) I don't really know what the context is of this African character but I heard he's like a gangster in real life or something. So I don't want my kids around someone like that, even if they're 50 feet away sitting in a theatre watching the picture of him.I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler since it was shown in the trailer, the triple headed lightsaber. You can't really keep waving that thing around us to impress us. It isn't held by a master sith like Anakin or something. We want COOL characters. Who are these lamoes? And sadly to say, yes, it is true if you heard it, George Lucas did not directly make all of this. That's not even talking about how he sold it to Disney (who knows then how much he was involved in it), I'm saying that movie plotwise and stuff he said in an interview that he didn't make it all. So note that. If you want a George Lucas masterpiece, it's nowhere to be found here.All the CGI stuff looks crud, I don't even think it's that big on the whole monsters thing. There's no real reprising Jedi, the random Gollum actor in it as a dweeby named character I find a bit offensive as I grew up with this sixtilogy and we never had nonsense like that. General Grievous, Darth Sidious, Darth Tyranus, Jango Fett, THESE are the big superstars of the Star universe. Not some guy ripping off the same 'I want revenge on behalf of my hero' plot. He is not a cool Sith. He's a LAMO I tell you!I can't really give anything away as I haven't seen it, but it's a ripoff plot. No yummy hungry Star Wars feeling when you're watching it, the CG looks amateurish, the models are all juvenile looking too. There's no heroes, there's no villains, and I bet too it's that stupid Clone Wars Yoda, the one who talks NOTHING like Yoda and sounds all fast-speaking and fake.The sets just don't feel like a Star Wars movie (figures, you can't leave Lucas out of 75% of it as I heard and expect it to work), it looks more like some American high school project mixed with some other typical movie like Bourne or whatever. The toys all were crud too.0 out of 10 if I could, or lower as I said in the subject. But IMDb doesn't allow it. Oh well.",1,8,10,15 July 2016
