The New World," Mixed Feelings
","My take on this movie is mixed. I loved the story of the movie, the sets, and the cinematography. However, i am not satisfied of the presentation of the move and the way the plot was presented and sometimes the scenes got confusing. Also i am not happy with Will Farrel's acting. Christian bale was classic as usuall. By the way, this is my first review ever, so i might be a bit off on some points.",6,0,0,13 July 2018
Mission: Impossible," The Best Mission Impossible
","Having Watched all the Mission Impossible movies, this in my opinion is the best of them all. It has class, and does not have meaningless action which the other ones have. This is the movie that started the mission impossible franchise.",8,0,1,14 July 2018
