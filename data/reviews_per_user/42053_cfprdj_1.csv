Requiem for a Dream," Great film but really depressing.
","Requiem for a Dream (2000) 3/10 as entertainment and 9/10 as a film Amazing acting that completely drags you into a depressing hopeless world of 4 addicts....The director and actors do an amazing job recreating this story. The question is? Do you want to spend 2 hours watching people destroy their lives and make you feel you are in it. ..... A very powerful movie....Still not sure if I am glad I saw it??? If you want entertaining drug freaks, try Trainspoting, which I loved. Same ugly topic, but entertaining. Very graphic. Depends on what you want. This film made us fell depressed and sick....Not what we want from a movie.",6,0,1,10 September 2004
