Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I laughed so hard I nearly shat my pants
","Are we SURE Andy Kaufmann is dead, because this guy was channeling him in this movie! I have not laughed this hard in years, but that just tells me where my humor quotient lies, apparently under a giant fat guy's hairy balls! I am glad to see that most of this movie is indeed LEGIT and is one long PUNK of US citizens, and apparently, hapless Romanian ones too.Sasha Cohen pulls off the Mother of All Punk'ds, infiltrating Terrorist War America as a Saddam Hussein look-alike to spread the good word from backwards Kazakstan.Along the way he demonstrates clearly how the culture of fear instilled on Americans by mass media and the government has turned them into a terrified, hostile, angry people, who run for their lives (literally) when approached by a stranger on the streets, or threaten to punch him in the balls.We see Upper-Class snobs, who are OK with a white man bringing a bag of his own crap to the table, but LORDY OH LORDY watch out when he then invites a black hooker in for dessert! It's Boot Out time and LET'S CALL THE COPS!!! Sasha shows us that you can actually drive down through a ghetto, walk up to some black guys, and NOT GET MUGGED, in fact, be tolerated, talked to, and have a guuuuuud tyyymeeee.Sasha shows us Petecostal freak-a-zoids who run around their church waggling their tongues and behaving like teenagers, and should not be running a D.Q. never mind in senior levels of politics and law.Sasha shows us the repressive ridiculousness of the US Empire's Police State, in the numerous shake downs he get's from cops just for driving an ice cream van with a camera crew through a US city.This film is a gem and Sasha Cohen is COMIC GENIUS. I hope to see more of his work, provided he is not strung up by the KKK first....",8,0,0,18 October 2010
Star Trek," Horrible, embarrassing, a travesty
","Yes, as a die-hard trekkie back to the original series, I admit bias.But let me say, through all of the years of good bad and ugly star trek movies and series, no movie, even that horrific Insurrection, so completely spat on Star Trek the way this movie did.So, young Spock. Stole the show, and excellent job btw. So why did the writers have to make him such an A-hole??? I HATED his character! Stranding a guy on a frozen planet is normal punishment? That was very nearly a 5 minute death sentence, the real Spock would NEVER have done that! And oh yeah, we are just going to now BUMP into the old Spock! (In a frikken ice cave!) WTF??????? Is that your pathetic attempt to save the movie? Is there some unwritten code somewhere that to guarantee success of your Star Trek movie, the Old Spock must somehow put in an appearance somewhere? Blowing up Romulus... I just can't even go there. You don't completely destroy a major race in the Star Trek mythos, just 'cause your some jerk director who wants to do things different. That's called Jumping the Shark, and was just ludicrous. What's next, the Klingons all mutate into giant easter bunnies? Why does the futuristic Romulan ship look like a giant octopus? Do you not know what Romulan ships look like? Kirk? Again, A-HOLE. Hated him. Horrible acting job, and HORRIBLE characterization of the young Kirk.Scotty? Ludicrous. Just get Lister off Red Dwarf and be done with it.Bones saved some of the day, excellent characterization and excellent job of him.Why, oh why, can you explain, does the ancient first Enterprise look way more advanced and super hot-roddy than the original series Enterprise, which comes along many years later? Hmmmm? Oh. Because the director doesn't give a damn. It shows in SPADES in this movie, and now, because this travesty, this mockery to the Star Trek mythos has been made, we must endure it as CANON, in all our computer games, books, cartoons, what have you. Yes yes, Vulcan get's sucked in a black hole kiddies! And Romulus blows up!!!! The director should be beamed inside a rock at the bottom of the ocean, which is where he belongs, for this piece of garbage.",4,11,16,13 July 2010
Iron Man 2," Waste of time, nothing compared to the original
","I did not enjoy this movie, other than the explosions, 'Iron Girls', and Scarlett in a body suit. The villains were pathetic (please tell me how a guy with zero armour and sporting WHIPS is scary or dangerous??? The plot was non-existent, motivation of characters was completely implausible, jokes were not present (or perhaps cringe-worthy) The movie only delivers on the one thing everyone went for anyway, SPECIAL EFFECTS, which is why I give it a 6 not a 2.This movie is complete garbage and not worth your time if you have a decent TV at home, rent it to watch the big booms.And Please keep Mickey Rourke off the screen!!! He SUCKS!!!!!",6,2,4,14 December 2010
Hot Fuzz," Dark English Comedy that defies definition
","What is it with the English, and their ability to make the weirdest movies yet somehow pull it off? I rented this expecting a light entertaining funny movie (the title, HELLO!!! It sounds like a porno!) I'm expecting a British version of 'Observe and Report' which is funny, because THAT movie got all weird and dark about 3/4 of the way through it too, but at least the first hour was full of hilarious comedy! This movie is NOT that funny! Or do I just not get it? Instead I am treated to a dark, strange, 'comedy'?!? with over-the-top gratuitous violence, broken up by dead boring dialogue and dry dry desert omg dry British humor. I was not aware that 'from the director of Shawn of the Dead' meant 'expect ultra-violence, weird quirky humor, bizarre plot twists, etc as this is all this guy is capable of' Much like Shawn of the Dead, this movie starts out with good intentions, hits us hard with some VERY DRY British wit that nearly has you putting in a ten minute bathroom visit and tostitos prep break early to slog through it.Then suddenly your in a graffic slasher movie, and people's heads are turning up on roads and church steeples are landing on top of people and some guy from Scream is running around with a frikken SCYTHE for goddsakes! Then the movie finishes with crazy over the top nutso plot that makes you wonder if they suddenly realized they were massively under budget and better spend the lot NOW. Let's blow up some stuff and open up with machine guns, hey? I'm left shaking my head, puzzling, not really sure what I watched....Despite all this I am giving it a high rating, because I think I need to watch this five more times, and I'm worried you guyz will not think I'm kewl if I don't, just because I'm stoopid and just don't get it...Pros: Dry British humor (if you like that stuff), super cheesy over-the-top violence (if you like that stuff) Cons: Dry British humor (if you like that stuff), super cheesy over-the-top violence (if you like that stuff) Movie takes forever to get going then explodes like a Mexican salsa IED all over your face and groin.",8,0,0,12 July 2010
Terminator Salvation," Excellent movie, Christian delivers yet again
","I loved this movie and consider it the second best of the Terminator movies, the first being the very first movie.Christian Bale brings his talent yet again and proves why I love this guy so much. He brings the John Connor character to life 'This is John Connor. If you are listening to this, YOU ARE THE RESISTANCE' in the vision I always had for him.The director and special effects team do an amazing job showing us a near future America where the last free humans fight a losing war of survival against the evil machines. Some obvious issues are slight and forgivable: - A rebel fighting force would not be using fixed runway aircraft such as the A-10 Warthog, such long runway installations would be easy targets for the machines and all would have been destroyed in the first minutes of the war. Instead, they should have been using helicopters and Harrier jump jets for their force, hidden in forest bunkers and able to take off straight up. Likely the airforce gave them free A-10's and the Marines said no.<ul><li>The one hope you have against giant 100 foot tall death machine walking robots is, THEY ARE NOISY. You can hear them coming for miles, as everyone who saw The Empire Strikes Back will attest. The rebel soldiers could hear the AT-AT's coming for MILES, even though they were walking in snow. So please tell me, HOW THE HECK DID THAT GIANT ROBOT SNEAK UP ON THEM AND RIP THE TOP OFF THE GAS STATION??? Thankfully, that was the only scene that screamed LUDICROUS to me.</li></ul>And finally, I have this special message to the human resistance. THE WAR IS COMING. THE TERMINATOR MACHINES ARE ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. A STORM IS COMING. BEGIN PREPARATIONS NOW. FEAR THE MACHINE.==Targe Out==",8,0,3,23 July 2010
Interstellar," Mathew and the Amazing Multi-Dimensional Bookshelf
","I looked forward to this space epic, and we planned for the IMAX experience to get the full vista of ooh aaah eye popping visuals this movie was promising.What did we get instead?Mathew Mcconnehay crying a lot.A multi-dimensional bookshelf (!?!)An evil Matt Daemon who pops out of nowhere and just as quickly blows himself upThe LUDICROUS notion that NASA would even entertain the idea of relocating Earth to a planet system dangerously close to a black hole.The IMPOSSIBLE achievement of navigating the event horizon of a black hole, because, 'This one is a SOFT black hole....' WTF????This movie is remarkably similar to 2001, in that: - It is WAY TOO LONG and in serious need of editing. - It involves special things happening near the outer gaseous giant planets. 2001 was Jupiter, this movie, it's Saturn. - It involves the lead protagonist going into a surreal other dimension that possibly involves aliens, with crazy visuals that feel more like a drug trip than a real experience (for an excellent job on a far more realistic looking experience, that would be the end of Contact when she navigates the alien trans-galactic wormhole transit system) - It promises outstanding space visuals, and then gives us precious few, spending most of the time on dusty earth watching people cry. - It has an ominous robot who you are not quite sure of until the end. The robot however is RIDICULOUS, looking like a BLOK character and completely impractical. Perhaps they could have used a suped-up version of the new NASA robot, which is very cool?Very disappointed with this flick, and with the writing for Mathew's character, who could have been much better. What the heck Matt Daemon was doing there, I have no idea.",5,6,11,18 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Cringe-worthy 'live video game' not worth the money
","I knew we were in serious trouble when it took 2/3 of the movie for the giant robot pilots to realize equipping their rock-em sock-em robots with swords might be helpful against giant monsters made of meat and bone...This movie is obviously a Japanese comic converted to an American movie. How strange then that there is one and only one Japanese character in the movie, a ridiculous scientist/robot pilot slash giggling schoolgirl because she has a crush on the lead character.There have been countless movies now about giant robots, and for some reason the robots in this franchise show up with nearly no weaponry, save for a plasma cannon on their hand that they strangely always save for the final blows, when they could be using it blow pieces off the charging rhinocerous like beasts on their first charge.Another bizarre item is the robots are flown around by fleets of Chinook helicopters, which would never work in real life and even CGI'd looks completely fake and unrealistic. Most of the robots are nuclear powered, why not give them jets so they can fly themselves in?? The strange lack of equipment on these behemoth robots only get's stranger when we learn that some models come with a giant rocket on the elbow to assist in punching. *GROAN*.... perhaps just give the thing a flamethrower on it's arm??? Toppers have to go to the science team duo. Hello, Pacific Rim? It's Big Bang Theory, THEY WANT THEIR CHARACTERS BACK!!! The movie so obviously rips off Leonard and Sheldon from BBT, that at times you would swear it really is Leonard. The guy dresses like him, acts like him, and talks like him! The British Snob Sheldon character thankfully was not a spitting image of Sheldon, but darn close in mannerisms.The movie staggers from one giant plot hole to the next, with acting that is horrific to behold.",3,6,11,14 September 2013
Watchmen," The apex movie of dark superheroes
","I remember reading this graphic novel in high school, and was very excited about this movie. It did not disappoint.In a refreshing trend began by perhaps Peter Jackson and his Lord of the Rings movies, tributes to past work of authors is being treated to something rare - directors who do not compromise, who present the work as written, who if anything give vibrant life to the brilliant work already done by the author. This is Watchmen.If the author is too dark, too gritty, then so goes the movie. You are treated to dark alter-heroes who you are not sure if you love or hate. In the case of the Comedian, I love him and hate him all at the same time. You are treated to the dirty naughty sexy trashy world of the pubescent young boy's fantasy supergirl, a world I relish in and still insist on to this day, and you are entertained.If the author put in ridiculous costumes and far fetched pets and tepid homosexual unlovable anti-heroes, then so goes the movie. He kept everything, and I salute him.Watchmen is a dark mirror on your society, and the evil of super hero worship, and the fallacy of fighting crime with violence. It is an exploration of the lurid sexuality in comic book heroines, and the horror and futility of war. All of this is capped with a top shelf music score and special effects visuals that blow it out of the water.One of my favorite movies, a brilliant masterpiece of film that I treasure.Hello darkness my old friend, it's good to talk to you again...",10,3,6,16 August 2010
Dark City," What the Matrix should have been
","This movie is far better than it's much more famous twin, the Matrix. Both movies involve the concept that what you see around you is all fake, created by aliens, and you are living in a prison. Dark City is a brilliant work of science fiction, mystery and horror, all in one. Where The Matrix is a glitsy expensive but plastic modern super car, with all show and no substance, Dark City is a classy timeless old gangster car with polished chrome and good leather seats, a feast for the eyes and a far stronger story to match.Kiefer Sutherland excels in one of his best roles, as he wheels around as the crippled and very creepy one human who serves the alien experimenters. This movie brings to mind classic works of science fiction. For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky...",Null,0,2,16 August 2010
No Country for Old Men," No country for believability
","This movie felt contrived, over the top, and forced, and oh yeah MANIPULATIVE, from day 1.Let's see.Ridiculously powerful and over-armed Mexican drug lords tied in with the DEA. Check.Ridiculously omnipotent all powerful bad-ass guy who is like a primevil force of nature and just goes around killing people who rub him the wrong way for sport, yet he is never in any danger of being arrested or killed. Check.Idiotic red-neck who makes so many idiotic mistakes (like returning to the scene of the crime, DUMBASS) he should be dead 1/2 an hour into the movie yet miraculously survives. Check.Grizzled old veteran 'cowboy-cop' who is wise like Jedi and yet strangely lazy as all git-out and never has to face the evil dude. Check.I could go on and on. Really, throwing a suitcase over a bridge into some bushes at the US-Mexican border in the middle of the night? Really? You think you'll ever see that again??? And how the heck did Woody find it? And really, let's pay a huge big name actor, Woody Harrelson, for ten minutes of bad acting, so he can get blown away and shock the heck out us? Sorry, didn't bite, I basically slumped back, shook my head, and said, 'well why the hell did they use Woody then?' And what exactly was Tommy Lee Jones doing? Wandering around, thinking about retirement, mumbling, not figuring out the stupid slaughterhouse weapon thing, BORING!!! Only to come within ten feet of the bad guy at the end and walk away! WHAT WAS THE POINT? And finally we are treated to seeing the bad guy get in a car crash. The car crash doesn't actually kill him. He still get's away... WHAT WAS THE POINT??? This movie is one long wandering boring search for a point. There is none.",5,3,8,12 January 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Nothing like the original LOTRs
","Standing alone, this movie would have been fine.But this is Lord of the Rings 4. And this is Peter Jackson. And his bar is impossibly high now.And he blew it.I went into this, I'm sure like a lot of you, expecting something amazing, something that would take the third LOTR movie, which is without a doubt, the greatest fantasy movie OF ALL TIME, and notch it up even higher, to ELEVEN as Spinal Tap would say.What with even better special effects technology available, we were expecting the incredible, along with the token incredible acting of the same gang more or less from before.Instead we get:<ul><li>Gandalf the Wooden. Acting due to Contract please and thank you. OH MUST I WEAR THIS CLOAK YET AGAIN??? Go play Magneto, your wizard days are up, McClellen.</li></ul><ul><li>A crazy long in desperate need of a major edit dwarf keg smasher party at the beginning that has you wishing they served draft at the theatre so you could at least get smashed along with them and figure out what was so damn funny!</li></ul><ul><li>A bizarre crazed wizard with bird poop on his head! Seriously!????? No, SErIOUSLY???!!!!!!!!!!!????????</li></ul><ul><li>A very very badly cgi'ed goblin king dude, who looks so badly cgi'd, he had almost zero screen presence. FAKE!</li></ul><ul><li>A silly roller-coaster ride (this is the next ride a Universal Studios, RIGHT???) goblin maze battle that had my head spinning and trying to keep up. Not exciting, just plain confusing and silly!</li></ul>Horribly disappointed. Peter Jackson took the Golden Cheque and exited the building.",7,4,7,26 September 2013
Kick-Ass," A dark horse super hero movie bloodbath
","I'll throw this right up top: ADULTS ONLAY.Do NOT take your kid to this. It is brutal, violent, over the top. Want your kid to watch a father shoot his daughter in the chest to teach her about bullet proof vests? Want to watch an adult man beat the crap out of a little girl? Want to watch a guy get munched in a car crusher? The rating on this movie MEANS IT, disregard at your own risk! That being said, if you love Quentin Tarantino movies (are you SURE he didn't at least advise on this??) and poking-fun type movies, this is for you. Think Mystery Men fused with Good Fellas and Kill Bill Vol. 1 and your close to what this movie delivers.Synopsis: A bored geek tries to realize his super hero dreams and quickly finds out most criminals can kick his ass and there are way more deadly super heroes already out there in secret as well.",9,1,4,18 August 2010
Gran Torino," A forgettable last movie for an aging Callahan
","I had high expectations when I finally got around to seeing this Clint Eastwood vehicle (ha ha). I am a huge Eastwood fan, especially his spaghetti Westerns ('What'd you say your name was, stranger? Clint: 'I didn't....') to his Dirty Harry movies, which we have all the lines memorized by heart, right?I was disappointed instead. Clint does not play a very convincing bigot, and that's no surprise, since Clint has never really acted, he's just played himself, and the man personally is very liberal and not at all a bigot.His 'I'm getting SOOOOO angry!' faces are hilarious, he looks like an aging Bruce Banner turning into the incredible Hulk or something, reminded me of a crocodile.The 'evil' Asian gang also does not come across convincingly AT ALL. They are like 12 year old's with Uzis. I would expect far darker characters and acting. The fighting scenes are like playful wrestles. In the end, Clint is playing himself, or his version of an aging Dirty Harry near the end of his life.His death scene sacrifice is hollow, as we all know how often people escape the courts these days, there's no justice in it. Better to have had us hate one or two of the gang members especially bad (maybe the ones who raped Clint's neighbor) and have him actually kill them.Really, to have the legendary Dirty Harry and High Plains Drifter fade out without getting to kill a single person in the movie was VERY DISAPPOINTING. Sorry if I am so jaded and evil and nasty and low brow, but THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT, not some biopic of Clint's career fading to black....And the end sequence with Clint 'trying' to sing? OMFG.... I am sorry I had to hear that once in my life...",6,3,6,10 February 2012
Clash of the Titans," I never thought I'd say this, but the original is better!
","And the original was awful.The holes in this movie are 'Legion', which is funny, because for some strange reason, Greek warriors keep talking about 'serving in the Legion', which is nonsense. This movie is supposed to be set in classic Greece, and Greeks served in the Army, ROMANS served in the Legion. Their uniforms and weapons are also decidedly Roman, what is with this fixation with Rome? Do Americans think Greek soldiers are not man enough?The story is garbage. Really not sure what Zeus is doing, we never have any idea what he is up to, suddenly at the end Hades his brother 'deceives' him, how again? Oh, the Kraken is going to kill everyone instead of make them worship you, or some such nonsense?HOW do you fly out of hell? If your trapped on the wrong side of the Styx, your DONE, you can't fly out of Hades, that's just stupid, or all the birds that die would get away. The battle with Medusa was pathetic, he just happens to spot a shiny shield at the last minute, 'Just don't look at her!' is his strategy going in?? The original, where he thought it out and then polished up a shield, is far better.Where is the ship? Didn't Perseus sail around on a ship, ala Jason and the Argonauts? I guess they blew the budget on the stupid fat Kraken thing, no money left for showing sailing ships. So we are treated to a bunch of Roman dudes wandering through the forest, with some girl in tow that somehow, nobody even questions or asks about.Then we get giant scorpions. The action is so badly done, too up close and in your face, that I miss him getting swallowed. How does a scorpion, which have very tiny mouths, swallow a guy in armour, anyway? They don't swallow their food anyway.SO then these weirdo evil looking mages show up. We don't see them tame the scorpions, just the start of them doing that, then next scene they are all riding giant scorpions. WTF?? This movie has: - Horrible writing, full of plot holes, missing info, stupid contrived devices, you name it. - Horrible acting. Watching Liam trying to fumble his way through a horribly written Zeus was cringe-worthy, and I typically LOVE anything the man attempts. - Horrible editing. The scenes jump, there's missing parts that we need to know, etc, just a bad cut job overall.I thought it was quite telling of them to chuck away the mechanical owl in the barracks at the beginning, an obvious slight thrown at the first Clash of the Titans movie, like somehow we all hated that damn owl and they were telling us NO, we AIN'T DOIN' THE DAMN OWL again, like somehow that would have us cheering from the rafters or something. I was disappointed when they left him behind, I liked the mechanical owl, and to me, this was saying, 'We will not get anywhere NEAR as good as the first movie, so we won't even bother to try using the robot owl'Thumbs down, I want my money back, garbage.",4,1,2,11 August 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Lackluster money-generating attempt based on previous
","To a seasoned movie watcher, those sequels that are simply trying to leverage more money out of our pockets, because the first movie rocked, are obvious, and this is no exception.Of particular bad taste was turning Megan Fox into a sex toy for male gratification. Yes, she is one very hot woman, but do we really need to see her straddled on a motorbike, grinding her hips into it in slow motion? Do we really need to see her sashaying down a college hallway in a schoolgirl skirt in slow motion, etc etc??? The first movie was excellent but was marred by one problem I see a lot of in newer, heavy fx based movies - they have the action scenes TOO CLOSE to the subject matter, so you can't really see what's going on, just a lot of very fast close up images of various robot parts zipping by smashing into stuff. This movie took that to a new level. The only scene that was memorable to me was the 'rumble in the jungle' forest battle scene were the Deceptacons bring serious hurt to Optimus. And only when they ZOOMED OUT and actually showed the battle properly! The lead character, who had some moxy and edge with his 'poor loser buys old junker and get's hot babe' routine, now completely blows it in the sequel, proving he is just a really bad actor that benefited from some good writing in the first movie.Transformers will forever be the first movie, this one was TERRIBLE.",4,0,7,23 July 2010
The Wrestler," Horrible, depressing slog through Mickey's real life?
","I came away wanting to slash my wrists after this, what a train-wreck depressing piece of garbage. This movie doesn't know what to do with itself, it has the feel of a bad camera work documentary, like some guy is shuffling along beside 'Randy the Ram' through the whole thing, watching him get evicted from his trailer, make lame come-ons to a stripper, do coke, get stapled in the back, puke, serve meat, it was one long boring depressing fly on the wall of what I take as parts of Rourke's real life disaster movie, minus the wrestling.This felt like a documentary of a real wrestler, perhaps Lance Cade? The characters were strange, with a daughter screaming obscenities in one scene then hugging her father and walking hand in hand in another, a stripper who refuses to date a guy just because she has a kid, a wrestler who has one bad day at the meat deli and decides to throw his life away because of it.I admit Mickey was acting his heart out (ha ha) but what it really felt like was he was just giving us a glimpse of his real life, that's why he portrayed it so convincingly.This movie is also horrifically brutally VIOLENT, not suitable for kids, not suitable for girlfriends, really just NOT SUITABLE for human consumption!!! Frikken GROSS!!!!! Is how I summarize it.",6,0,2,4 October 2010
The Wolverine," A pleasant journey into wolverine character development
","Well, the wife liked it, and usually that's a big thumbs down from the guys, but for once, I have to agree with her! I really enjoyed this movie, from several angles.I really liked the fleshing out of Logan's character, and think they pulled it off. I really enjoyed the Japanese setting, the on the run type movie very much like Bourne Identity, and liked the plot twist of Logan's sudden vulnerability. Super heroes are much more enjoyable when they are mortal, which is why I've always despised Superman...The ninjas were, horrible, knowing full well what that is all about and being one, the modern ninja is the yakuza assassin, not the clown costume bozos in this movie who give bujinkan a bad name... Enough on that, yes I see you tracing my IP...Perhaps the one flaw in this movie was the ending, which tried to 'sew a pig stomach explosion into a Gucchi bag'. Too many twists trying to weave together, too many characters suddenly acting COMPLETELY DIFFERENT at the end of the movie to fit a plot twist (GOD I HATE THAT TRICK!!) All in all though, a definite watch for all Wolverine fans, as I am, having named my son LOGAN and all ;)",8,7,13,26 September 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Without a doubt, best movie I have ever seen
","The theatre was sold out, so I sat on the stairs. All through the 3 1/2 hours this movie captivated me, and I didn't realize I was sitting on cold metal stairs.All three of these movies have it all, Peter Jackson is a god, or was, for this one time, with these three hits. He pulled it all together, firstly by not mucking much with what was essentially the holy grail of fantasy writing from Tolkien. He threw in: - Amazing soundtrack - AMAZING costumes, best fantasy costumes EVER done, so they should be good for three movies. - AMAZING backdrop scenery. Doing it in New Zealand was brilliant! - EXCELLENT writing, dialogue. Not sacrificing on the obvious camp and cheese present in fantasy stories to begin with, he relished in it, pumped it up to 11. Way to go Peter. It's called NOT SETTLING, having the balls to play it the way it was meant to be played.The final in the three has it all. I mean, you have scenes that you will never again see in movies. Amazing scenes, creatures, all of it, I scarcely breathed through it all.If I can fault Jackson AT ALL, and it's difficult, it would be cutting Christopher Lee out in so many edits. Lee did an AMAZING job of Sauroman, on par with the portrayal of Gandalf, and he deserved more screen time. Screw the limits, let the audience sit for another 15.I treasure this collection of movies as my central prize in my DVD library. I also rank LOTR: TFOTR as # 2 greatest movie of all time, and LOTR: TTT as #3.",10,0,2,13 July 2010
Easy A," A surprisingly well written comedy that adults will enjoy
","I got this with the kids because they basically badgered me into it, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The writing is above par for a teen comedy, and the main character delivers her lines with a quick, crisp and witty monologue that only starts to wear on you near the end. The movie is surprisingly tame so far as nudity, language, and suggestive scenes go, given it's subject matter, and is a good lesson type movie for young women.Look for excellent lines delivered with perfection by the movie's liberal dad.The only disturbing part of the movie, which really could have been modified or written out, was the surprisingly creepy Lisa Kudrow who has seduced a student and now has given him an STD, yet allows the main character to take the fall.",7,0,0,12 January 2011
Braveheart," A movie worthy to honour Wallace
","I have read a lot of flak about this movie and how it is historically inaccurate. Like that really matters in Hollywood! In fact, many many parts of this movie accurately portray the stories, myths, legends and historic truth around the true life hero, William Wallace.Sure we can argue over a good single malt all night over whether the ancient kilt was being worn yet in Scotland in the 13th century when William Wallace returned to Scotland from France in a bid to unite the clans and achieve independence. It really doesn't matter. It's a movie about Scotland, and the ladies demand we wear kilts, it's only fitting.I accept the director's conflicted portrayal of Robert the Bruce, torn between loyalty to his diseased evil father and the dream of an independent Scotland, and I forgive him his introduction of the French Princess as a love interest, we have to give the lassies something to watch after all.Most amusing is his use of the diminuative Mel Gibson to play a man who was apparently tall for his generation. William Wallace may well have grown an inch each time his story was re-told, and started out a short man as well. Mel did his best on the accent, and I found it pleasing to the ear, Scottish with a bit'o Aussie, what's the harm?Did you know some believe Braveheart (William Wallace) may have been the inspiration for Robin Hood? Wallace was skilled in archery as were his men, they wore green camouflage, hid in the woods, and hit the English in commando style raids. Much of their spoils would have been passed on to the dirt-poor Scottish around them.Those rich Scots, who took English bribes in return for loyalty to the English crown, are the ones who got to write history, and of course they despise the commoner Wallace for his attempt to upset their applecart. They brand him to this day a villain.But to this commoner Scot, Mel portrayed my mythological hero accurately and true to heart.May Scotland be one day free of English dominance and re-assert it's true culture!",10,2,8,16 August 2010
The Runaways," Awesome rock movie, but left wanting more...
","I really enjoyed what I got to see of this movie. 'Cherry Bomb' is still stuck in my head, and seeing an all-girl band belt it out onstage was a real treat. I'm surprised modern female singers do not give it a go as this was the first I had heard it and LOVE it.Michael Shannon was brilliant as the uber-sleeze but very smart Kim Fowley. He saw the 'jail bait band' potential right from the start and oh how telling that this band's first big break through was in Japan (can you say Sailor Moon, anyone?) Dakota put in one of her best performances to date playing the Cherry Bomb herself, and after donning the corset and stockings, I can say that Dakota is finally all growd up.Kristen Stewart rocked the role as Joan Jett, but I was left feeling ripped off. I am a huge JJ fan, and it would have been great to extend the movie and give us one of Joan's early hits, complete, on stage to show her comeback.I was also insulted for Lita Ford's sake that the movie made NO mention of her successful career in the ending credits! It appeared the director was just as overly fixated on the gyrating teen blonde bombshell lead singer as the male audience of the day.I was glad to see Cheri is still alive after all that, but CHAINSAW SCULPTING???? WTF??? That was a laugh.",7,2,5,16 September 2010
