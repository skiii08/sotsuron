"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Oh Deary Me
","Simon Pegg tries to act. Thandie Newton??(if that is a name) cannot act and to be fair doesn't embarrass herself by even trying unlike like Pegg.Surely its enough that she looks pretty and does those cosmetic adverts as well.The plot is par for the course for Pegg ,an allegedly 'likeable' oaf/complete loser(played by Pegg)must over come the odds and the obstacles that everyone else in life seem to overcome with ease in order to get the girl and ya ya ya yawn. So he starts running to prove he'll be a great husband and a dad because that's really all you need to make your life partner happy and successfully raise a happy well balanced child =running skills",1,0,1,4 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Dark Brilliance much better than campy iron man
","Compared to the last travesty Called the hulk This film is about 3 million times better .The character of banner is actually believable and doesn't suffer from pointless flashbacks that make no sense.Mostly it doesn't suffer from Ang Lee attempting to shoe horn his own weird story into a movie called hulk. The action is absolutely breathtaking and inventive .The sad love story between Betty and banner was tragic ,even the few moments of comedy didn't jar with the rest of the film .The end was pure classic hulkA thoughtful ,intelligent movie about a monster and the monstrous men that want to use him for their own ends",9,2,3,10 April 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Just like all the others its awful
",Bad acting nonsensical plot a series of boring action set pieces and just like all the others -absolutely nothing to do with resident evil. Why on earth has this franchise made it to a fourth movie? It fundamentally fails on every level As a cheap game cash in type movie it barely references the source material as a film in its own right its appalling i didn't not care about the characters because they were cardboard cut outs with zero personality i actually found my self hoping the bad guys would win at least then the movie would demonstrate some originality.fat chance alas,1,29,51,11 September 2010
Star Trek," Awful hideous travesty ,but don't take my word for it...
","The film starts off promisingly kirk's father makes a heroic sacrifice to save the rest of the Kelvin's crew so far so good thought the audience unfortunately it all goes to hell from there. A blond child-kirk takes a car off a cliff for no apparent reason other than it looked good in the trailer. The first warning signs should have been the blatant product placement of a mobile phone in the 'Antique' car.It was even more cringe inducing than the IRobot product placement of modern trainers in a sci future based film.Lord give me strength. We jump around in time to a bar fight,and the first day of kirks academy career then suddenly to three years later.After some more embarrassing drinks related product placement,the 'Plot' begins. An emergency at vulcan causes the cadets to be given starship assignments.The excuse being the fleet is elsewhere dealing with another crisis?The whole fleet is gone and for some reason having left earth,vulcan and we assume the surrounding planets completely unguarded? and there's a slew of brand new starfleet vessels (including the enterprise) with no crew happily orbiting just waiting for kirk and co to use just in case?? With logic taking such a permanent holiday so early on in the film alarm bells started to ring at this point. kirk gets made acting second officer of the ship having no experience whatsoever .Pike surrenders to the mysterious alien ship and we pretty much never see him again .Commander Spock takes command ,vulcan is blown up despite a appallingly bad fight scene with swords?no need to use phasers its not like its the mid 23rd century or anything. Kirk and spock clash over how to proceed so spock ,the logical Vulcan of star trek legend fires him off in an escape pod towards a federation outpost on a icy planet. Its there that the movie abandons all pretence of trying to make sense. Older spock ,scotty and his midget comedy sidekick show up and attempt to explain all the thundering plot holes in the movie and wouldn't you know it use time travel to paper over all the cracks.We discover Romulus is doomed ,spock failed to save it and nero the bad guy of the piece ,who speaks about twice in the whole movie, (played by a criminally wasted Eric Bana) blames spock for the death of his family.We learn the mysterious alien ship is a Romulan mining vessel? presumably converted to fire very primitive looking missiles that jar badly with the star fleet weapons used against it.Some how it can destroy entire fleets of enemy ships . After kirk assumes command by getting the emotionless spock mad he lies in ambush for nero as he approaches earth .One more badly done and confusingly filmed fight scene (in which they actually remember to use their phasers)and then cadet kirk gets given several promotions all the way to captain.And the audience scratches it collective head and wonder if they can get a refund from paramount.Its not science fiction theirs no science at all No intelligent talk about the ramifications of playing with time . Its not action as its impossible to tell whose fighting who its not a film as such more of a hap hazard collage of bad ideas bad acting and missed opportunities an insulting waste of time and effort",1,17,25,2 July 2009
Iron Man 2," A bit of a laugh if you can figure out what mickey rouke is saying
","As mindless action films go this isn't bad just like the last one ,the film hangs on downey'sarrogant boyish charm. The action sequences are are quite good although the film drags fatally in the middle if you just in it for the violence and the comedy The film gets bogged down with tony's personal problems.The ending is of course slam bang shoot-fest . The bad guys here are the weak link in the chain , Rourke is completely unintelligible as 'ruskie Whip guy' (so unengaging you wont remember his name either).His motivations are something about his dad ,maybe? Then there was hammer sam rockwell star of massively over rated Moon here a kind of pointless character(character is a description used very loosely) after setting him up as the puppet master this arm dealing sociopath is just get hauled off at the end like a punkIn conclusion a light weight popcorn movie worth ONE watch",6,0,1,17 May 2010
World War Z," Pointless,Dull and insulting
",Another huge fan of the book wondering what the hell i just watched. why does Hollywood even bother buying the rights to other media if there just going to utterly destroy it?Why not just make an original film? is really so bankrupt of all ideas?The film has a UN employee brad Pitt travel around the world to various action set pieces for pretty much no reason only to survive a series of increasing unlikely close shaves .Until near the end he and his one handed companion walk out of a devastating plane crash with a minor wound.no else survived of course. For once the mean streets of Cardiff prove less dangerous than zombies as they make their way to the wizard castle to find a magical cure or something.....,1,1,4,3 November 2016
Shaun of the Dead," So bad ...its really pathetic
","Simon pegg cannot act and is not funny. So imagine my disdain when i see him trying ACTING in a alleged COMEDY. The plot is non existent ,zombies attack and hilarity is supposed to ensue.Unfortunately like every other movie pegg is in i spent an hour and a half waiting for something funny to happen. The credits must have beat them to it.almost every other person in the film including his long time friend frost is able to make the audience suspend their disbelief until mr pegg ruins it all again with his stilted freshly memorized acting work .Take my advice don't get dragged along to see his latest travesty because of how many brainless dolts think it looks mind alteringly funny . Deep down you just know it will be worse than showgirls",1,20,56,8 September 2011
The Girl Next Door," weirdly schizophrenic film
","A teenager falls in love with the girl next door and then realises she a porn star,and they some how take this inventive premise and make one the most boring films ever made. To be fair it starts getting funny suddenly in the last half hour,before that its boring as hell . After an hour of a uncharismatic ,lantern jawed teenager mooning over a girl and endlessly boring people over his college scholarship interview,it suddenly morphs into a hilariously bad taste comedy for the last stretch. Problem is of course you have to put up with the rest of this film with no jokes .At least when dusk till dawn went from violent escape caper to horror movie both halves of the film were entertaining but this is just weird.",4,0,1,30 July 2014
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Another Rubbish X men cash in
","As if last stand wasn't appalling enough fox seeks to ring the last vestiges of credibility from the franchise until all that is left is a dried out husk. we see wolverine and his brother victor fighting in various American wars The civil war up to to Vietnam is covered in about 2 minutes. After that its business as usual with lots of cameos from marvel comic book characters but very little characterisation.There just thrown in to try to con the fan boys to see the movie.Think how 'shoe horned' venom felt in spiderman 3 and you'll get the picture. So we get the blob, gambit, deadpool ,white queen(emma frost), silver fox,Cyclops(maybe they felt guilty for killing him off in number 3 or having him knocked out for 99% of X2).Mentioning these characters is mostly pointless as they may as well not be in the film. There just there as cyphers to look pretty as hugh jackman does what hes done in the last 3 films :fight ,growl and moan. The action (since there really is no plot) is okay if you've never seen an X film before, if you have its pretty boring .He doesn't seem to like changing his tactics thats why'hes the most boring at what he does'. One of the most boring pointless films ever made focusing on one of the most overrated comic book characters ever. Don't see the film or buy the DVD don't give these soul vampires a dime",1,4,9,24 July 2009
Hot Fuzz," why pegg why ?you don't need the money
","Simon pegg and nick frost team up (for a change) but his time playing themselves in police uniforms rather than ...not in police uniforms?? Pegg is a super cop transferred to the sticks by fellow officers who don't like him(shock). there he encounters a whole bunch of stuff i wont go into not because i don't want to spoil the film for you ,oh no, pegg has already comprehensively done that. Pegg and his wife frost bungle and gurn there way through action alleged comedy until the end of the film ,then the audience breaths a sigh of relief. Yet another miss from the man that brought us the brilliant spaced but unlike spaced this embarrassingly bad action non-comedy is not a winner",1,5,25,16 September 2012
Terminator Salvation," Underrated brilliance don't listen to the detractors
","The best terminator yet An intelligent ,thoughtful action film commenting on the nature of humanity and morality. The humans while considering themselves morally superior to the enemy are ultimately saved by a 'mindless evil machine'. The main thrust of the plot is the humans have identified a 'shut down signal' that allows them to hack and destroy all the machines within transmission range.The resistance leaders ,of which John Connor is NOT one ,decide to launch an all out strike against sky net headquarters in San Francisco using the signal as their ace in the hole. Meanwhile a young Kyle Reece fights his way across America with a mysterious stranger to try and find Connor (having heard his voice of the resistance transmissions).Kyle is captured and taken to skynet and the stranger hooks up with a resistance fighter pilot . The stranger is eventually revealed to be a machine having set off the magnetic mines that protect connor's base. In prison he completely refuses to admit he's a machine despite connor shooting him several times. As the hour of the attack approaches john connor and his pregnant wife discover that kyle Reece is a prisoner of skynet along with thousands of others.His attempt at convincing the leaders to stop the attack is rebuffed,he transmits to all bases to stand down and not execute the orders. This gives him the time to mount an attack on sky net to rescue the people.But its an elaborate trap...people said this film was mindless action??? In a terminator film??Heaven forbid such heresy. Christian bale is brilliant as the messiah warrior john connor his supporting cast are also top notch especially Sam Worthington. Great actor great story great action .The only other thing we need is for the critics to get a clue and have an even more ass kicking sequel.",10,1,4,9 September 2009
X-Men," A good faithful adaption of a comic book Classic
","This film does a very good job of setting the scene it introduces mutants a sect of humanity hated and feared by the rest. we see rogue a young runaway who happens upon a another mutant a gruff unsociable cage fighter named Logan.A dude with amnesia and retractable metal claws. We meet senator Kelly a political opportunist using the 'Mutant threat' to further his own career.He puts me in mind of McCarthy,with his belligerent and combative interviews in a senate committee of mutant affairs.He grandstands and scaremongers with the best of them.All the while pushing his Mutant control bill.A law that will force all mutants to register with the government. Meanwhile there's Erik Lensherr a survivor of the holocaust and mutant with extraordinary powers.Having seen man's ability to be inhumane first hand he believes mutants should strike first while humans are weak and divided on the issue. His old school friend takes the polar opposite view and teaches his students to learn to live with their powers for the benefit of all humans.Professor Charles Xavier and his students the X men soon come into conflict with Lensherr. The stage is set for a war of ideology based on racial grounds. Erik with every reason to hate humans launches his attack to preserve his kind.Xavier on the other hand has a more precarious moral position. He risks his X men's lives to defeat his own kind and defend the very humans that would love to get rid of them. A complex moral minefield and a great filmShame then that the sequels were such utter dross no wonder Bryan singer walked away",8,3,5,16 September 2010
Spider-Man: Homecoming," same ol' same ol'
","The film is okay but absolutely nothing we haven't seen before. There's spectacular action set pieces ,quippy dialogue and peter sacrificing his personal life for the greater good. Peter Parker has girl trouble . a morbidly obese oriental friend that wont stop asking annoying questions. and tony stark patronising him, using him and then ignoring himThe only real problem i had with this average and inoffensive movie was spidey's great mistake the ferry disaster was actually stark's fault. He completely ignores parker's warning about the arms deal does not respond so our plucky hero must go it alone to stop the bad guys. The fbi show up and instead of easily taking down the villains who are unprepared they use the distraction to pull out the super weapons and slice the ferry in half.Stark called them in secret and decided not tell peter about it??then proceeds to scream at him about how its all his fault?? Stark is a dick through out this movie much worse than the actual villain who is great.Vulture even gives a great speech about rich people not caring and using people like us to fight there wars and pave their roads and clean up the mess. Stark having completely screwed up his life and forced him into a life of crime.its worth one watch despite the stark issues",5,5,10,11 July 2017
Watchmen," Brilliant ,dark brilliance
","A lot of bad reviews have been published about this movie.The people who didn't get the movie and the people who liked the comic and hated anyone who would dare make a film of this.Ignore them all ,the film has a large ensemble cast and unlike x men actually does all the characters justice,rorsach - possibly psychotic obsessed, vigilante .Night owl,still morning 'the keene act' and the hero life he used to have. Silk-Spectre pushed into the hero life by her pushy hero mom. Ozymandias - proclaimed smartest man on earth has turned from hero to business man. A hero is killed and this starts the investigation into a conspiracy surrounding the watchmen.Rorschach tries to enlist the help of the only true superpowered man,dr Manhattan and his former partner,night owl, and is rebuffed .One of the amazing things about the movie is the realistic world they have created ,a world in which Nixon is a five term president the cold war has accelerated and the world hangs on the brink of nuclear annihilation. All this functions as the back drop to the investigation which eventually draws some of the team back together. The film excels with dealing with moral grey areas and the decay of society in general.Overall the watchmen is about sacrifice and the greater good, can their be a greater good if the smaller goods get trampled on? Do the ends justify the means? This film intelligently asks the questions and invites the audience to form their own opinion rather than force some cheesy moral down their throat",10,2,5,10 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," gritty & realistic, In this case it means really really Boring
","One thing i detest more than bad films are overrated films. This was touted as dark and realistic, all the things the bond films are not. Unfortunately they forget to make us care about the characters. I lost interest in who bourne was long before the end of the film I was hoping the government forces would kill him off early and i could leave the cinema.So a blank slate of a man involved in lots of fighting for no particular reason and a love interest(thats not really interesting). One of those films that leaves you completely cold ,Found myself wondering who the heck the people were who loved this film. I pictured them also laughing at Billy crystal moviesplease avoid the movie is worthless and its sequels...",1,4,10,10 April 2010
The Matrix Revolutions," Best of the Trilogy
",Brilliant awesome action the attack on zion was breath taking dramatic and gritty. The final battle against smith was classic high stakes grudge match even smith's speech was legendary. The film plays with people expectations by giving them a brilliant but unpredictable ending. Instead of having the machines thrown down by the blind messiah they make peace.Now there's a novel concept. Instead of the hero kissing the girl at the end he sacrifices himself for the greater good.The writers were completely unafraid to break with traditional Hollywood formulaic rubbish and do something interestingand i say God bless em,9,2,4,20 September 2009
Resident Evil," They would have to invent a new vocabulary to describe how BAD this is
","A character called Alice famous from the resident evil games (Hang on, no, they just made her up) it s not like they've got a lot of characters to choose from with the rich source material or anything. Anyway a character called alice ( and a cheap excuse to have lewis carol references and pretend the movie is worth while)wakes up with no memory(the audience wishes the same in 120 minutes)in a mansion not knowing about the danger that await her but rather than focus on the mansion (the focus of the first game)they immediately go under ground into a secret research 'place' and find zombies ,monsters etcI would spoil the rest of the 'plot' for you but there really isn't oneand I have no respect for the film or its fans. Its merely an abomination I hate this movie so bad i resent the time it took to right this review don't watch its everything that wrong about the movie industry",1,2,5,14 September 2010
Batman Begins," Dark,impressive ,Realistic ,grim and with a stellar cast
","This movie does one thing very well it sets the scene for the appearance of batman brilliantly .We See Bruce's torment and pain his burning desire to help the people of gotham .It finds a way to make the essentially silly concept of a man in a giant rubber Gimp suit not only plausible but also quite scary.It explores who bruce is what kind of place he inhabits and how he learned his craft.Also very wisely keeps batsy off screen long as possible .His appearance is sometimes augmented by the hallucinations of his opponents making him into a full fledged demon beast.Each of the cast get a chance to shine with their character acting and the ability to make the silly believable. The action is fantastic sword fights, street fights ,pitched car battles and a train to round it all off.This movie works on every level as drama, dystopian horror and of course sweet sweet action. Shame about the sequels really",10,0,0,12 December 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An unexpected Abomination of a classic
","An unexpected Abomination of a classic . If you read the book or not doesn't actually matter because most of this film is asides ,made up sub plots, extra characters and other awfulness. Massive shifting of characters from believable to unrecognisable seems to be the norm here .One boring action set piece after another ,actual plot is something you don't even dare dream about. hard to believe this is the man that fans demanded to direct the films i think even Michael bay would have been a better choice and more faithful to the source material. After shouting for the hundred time 'when does this happen in the book?' I suddenly felt a calm descend over me and realised this is not the story of a hobbit who goes on a journey and finds his courage this is the story of a great of director who went on a journey and gets seduced by money churning out awful cash in prequels like this for ever more .George Lucas disease strikes again peter Jackson RIP",1,5,8,23 August 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," its ok..... for only being HALF a movie
","Much like matrix reloaded or empire strikes back the movie is
 'to be continued' so what we have here is half of an ok movie with no real end and an annoying massive cliff hanger.
so here's half a review...",5,11,34,30 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," spits in the face of every fan repeatedly and demands they pay for the privilege
","Words actually fail me at everything they've done to the old characters.
i could say its appalling ,its disrespectful, its awful,that the film makers don't get star wars at all.
but none of these words comes close to actually seeing this film and viewing this affront for your self.The new actors are bland and terrible just like the last one.Its an achievement that the film, manages to be worse in an entirely different way than the pastiche /rip off feel of the last movie .Beloved characters are changed beyond all recognition and reason,poorly used then disposed of.Mary sue herself has almost no training from the jedi master but of course doesn't need it because she's a strong independent woman ,like beyonce, right?
Finn otherwise known as captain bland goes off on his own to do stuff we dont care about because otherwise he wouldn't have anything to do in the film .Poe Dameron of course gets short changed again.I am done with star wars",1,24,38,16 December 2017
Evil Dead," Gore fatigue and random switching character focus near the end
","I liked the start of this film a lot, ratchets up the tension nicely, had inoffensive and bland central characters ,a drug abuse sub plot ,and two estranged sibling trying to bond.As the gore hits the fan and things start to fall apart the movie shifts focus on to the brother and his struggle to keep alive until ten minutes before the end when we write him off and switch back to a suddenly ,and stupidity, cured sister whose spent most of the movie as the evil killer bitch in the cellar.now we're supposed to cheer for her survival as she previously slaughtered most of the cast??Sorry thats not how movies work ,you cant get audiences to invest emotionally in characters like that .FAIL",2,1,10,3 May 2013
The Dark Knight," Corporate tie ins, nowhere near as good as the first,plot holes
","I loved the first film, but i just could escape the feeling that this was a lot more of a popcorn movie. The only bright spot in the movie for me was the joker brilliant insane agent of chaos.Played to the hilt by heath ledger. The were too many things that made no sense in the film and could only be explained by corporate interference,The man responsible for the first great film simply couldn't have made this mess(or so i thought)The heavily armoured 'tank like' batmobile built for the army is taken out by a rocket?Thus batsy must eject in the bat pod and a new 'must buy' toy vehicle for the kids. The military must have asked for a bridging vehicle that can eject a motor bike from wayne industries?? (an example of the military-industrial complex gone mad or completely non-sensical idea that the writer didn't think through?)Batman goes to hong kong for about 5 minutes to catch a man we barely see again.The bullet 'resistant' armour is penetrated by a DOG?With kevlar Dentures perhaps?So now batsy has to have a completely different suit made and thus a completely new action figure for the kids.Ker chingThe gotham city of the first film looks completely different,even the brass looking monorail of batman begins(a major feature and plot point of the film) .It is replaced by the very dark industrial looking chicago elevated train system.And did they really think we wouldn't notice that the sandstone pointed-roof tower of wayne tower was suddenly morphed into Black flattop of completely different design.Several signs bellow 'welcome to chicago' in the background.The new Rachel dawes is completely different and the new actress doesn't even try to emulate the character seen in the first film.An utterly pointless cameo from the scarecrow ,captured in 30 seconds flat .over all a wasted opportunity kind of like comparing x men to the dire sequels avoid",2,4,9,11 April 2010
This Is Spinal Tap," Boring ,please don't make me watch again
","Don't want to too much time of this steaming pile so I'll be brief. Where to begin ,the terrible accents ,someone told me later they were supposed to be English (not south African), is that what Americans think they sound like? Sat waiting for the entire length of the film ,utterly bored, waiting for a laugh and then it ended.I have no idea why this bafflingly unfunny movie is so popular at all and now gets voted one of the best comedies of all time ?It seems to me more of an exercise in remembering cool quotations than an actual watch-able film,much like withnail and I.So to fill in the minimum ten lines I'll end by saying something positive ,its far too dull to hate .That must be ten lines by now",1,6,25,10 August 2015
Frank," Spectacular
","Spectacular. Frank is an amazing film .Bizarre beautiful and with a great ending. based incredibly loosely on frank sidebottom the northern gent with the crazy band and the weird appearance on children's TV in the 80s/90s,and with a voice like a kazoo. In real life our frank died from cancer,in poverty, and was only saved a pauper's funeral by charitable donations.fortunately this film only take the craziness and the giant head from franks legacy. Its not a full on comedy it has its darker moments and little twists that take the film from good to great.So I wont spoil any part of the film for you with a synopsis . just go watch.",10,0,1,10 March 2015
WALL·E," Boring
","watching a robot trundle around a post apocalyptic world building towers of garbage pretty much sums up how I felt about this terrible movie. I didn't care about any of the characters at all.The human whales or the robots an so didn't care about there plight.The fatties could stay in space for ever for all this movie made me care about them.Some kind of half hearted love story between two machines that have just met and have no discernible personality ??why? I could explain the plot or the story but I just don't care enough about this terrible piece of cinema to do that. so to sum up and to make it to the bare minimum ten lines ,i will say its so bad its terrible",Null,2,6,2 April 2016
Wonder Woman," boring boring boring
","This movie goes so very slowly its like watching paint dry.Getting used to the funny accents took a good long while, but i needn't have worried this film gives you over two hours of boredom to get used to the Israeli Amazons accents.Kind of reminded me of the Alexander movie with Colin Farrell .He still had his Irish accent playing a Macedonian so instead of getting him to change it they just made all the other Macedonian characters Irish????Her childish belief that Ares is responsible is repeated so often we just know were being set up for a giant obvious fall when it turns out its just mankind doing what they do best.The action at the end is entertaining but not enough to make up for and hour and a half of completely being bored rigid.This film made me wish id died in world war one so i wouldn't have to watch it.",2,111,220,14 June 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Bad plot, insane twist and it's boring ,boring ,boring.
","okay don't get me wrong its not the travesty that was the dark knight but it seems to replace actively offending me with actively trying to bore me to death.Two hours later (it felt like a lifetime)the action finally gets going but cant really make up for the bum numbing ,mind shredding tedium of the rest of the film . Like most films the bad guy is all but invincible until the end when the script dictates he must suddenly lose to the hero.and then a new bad guy emerges for the last 20 minutes of the film and bane is rendered unimportant. Its a twist of usual suspects like proportions but unlike that film destroys the movie rather than blows peoples tiny minds. another wasted opportunity of a film i hope the next director knows something about directing a coherent film not a dark disappointing mess",1,13,27,26 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Triumph
","all the critics are ,of course, completely wrong. The film is 3 hours long but doesn't feel it. its jams an awful lot into each scene the two male leads and there relationships never feel short changed. The build up to the conflict feel inevitable, inescapable and is not a disappointment when it arrives. It is not however the heart of the film ,it's all about the heroes place in the world that only knows shades of grey. Being pulled in different directions by the forces of corruption and trying to save a humanity that seems far too petty and stupid to be worth saving. The film has a lot to say as well as being merely an action film. so go watch.",9,2,4,26 March 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Utterly insulting travesty
","A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem 'solved'. They are of course 'out foxed' at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.The'film' version ,and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely. So kudos to them .They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book.",1,33,82,16 October 2009
X2: X-Men United," too many characters ,too confusing plot, way too much wolverine
","the film is a mess Xavier and Cyclops are taken out in the first 5 minutes in order to give Hugh jackman most of the film to himself. instead of established characters we get nightcrawler and striker. an awful lot of running about in tunnels at the end and a confusing barely coherent plot that does a grave disservice to the original. Halle berry phones in her performance & strangely looses her African accent from the first film and day dreams about winning another undeserved Oscar. The attack of the soldiers on the school is ridiculous Hugh seems to kill 100s of soldiers and the rest of the students ain't exactly defenceless either.An 'American version' of colossus is completely in vulnerable smashing down soldiers and walls and yet they retreat.We never see where the escapees go .Logan and rogue and iceman just drive off,easy enough with all those helicopters and special forces soldiers hovering outside. Cyclops and Xavier pop up again for the last 5 minutes ,a pointless death and then its cue the even more dire sequelsIts all down hill from here folks",2,0,1,16 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," far beyond awful
","A insulting retread of previous star wars movies by a man who's main claim to fame is coming up with appalling TV shows and getting his check before people figure out they are terrible.Another death star,another young person from a desert with no parents who needs training in the force (yet doesn't?) ,Another last ditch battle against overwhelming odds. The new 'actors' are terrible ,wooden and poorly realised. Daisy Ridley is laughable in her role. Her 'character' Rey is somehow worse, she excels at absolutely everything some how? mechanic ,star ship piloting, light sabre duelling, using the force??? I started to think that it would rey training Luke when they finally found him.And who the hell goes into hiding and leaves a map all over the galaxy of where he's gone. Nothing about this movie makes sense at all until you factor in who directed it",1,33,83,5 June 2017
Looper," Creepy eyes, bad prosthetic nose constantly reminds you this is a movie and not reality
","A young murderer called Joe lives a life of pre arranged shootings and wild drug parties,until one of his suddenly materialising victims turns out to be an older version of himself. How we know this is because that's how the film has been advertised not because of any thing like a resemblance . Which bring us to the heart of my problem with the movie,Joseph gordon levitt has been made up (badly)with a rubber nose and contact lenses to try and resemble a young bruce willis .They really ,truly failed. Every single time I looked at the weird eyes of JGL it broke the reality of the film for me. Creepy, bright and totally out of place. oh dear I'm sure it was good other wise even if almost everyone in the cinema guessed the ending long before the punch. Shame i couldn't enjoy it felt like it was constantly holding up a sign saying Sack the make up department",3,1,3,11 September 2013
Moon," Predictable and boring but thinks its original
","I don't know how many different ways to say the same thing in order to get up to the minimum amount of lines required for a review but Ill try and say this as clearly as i can this is a bad movie. It bores the hell out of me,its not moody,its not arty,is not beautiful desolation its just mind numbing. A unbelievably straight forward story masquerading as deep and meaningful with lots to say on the human condition.The only thing it says is the people behind this have never read a science fiction book in there lives and don't know how to make a good film. Sam Rockwell strays from boring to annoying whilst making time for a few choice moments of being tiresome. I would avoid this movie as one would avoid all over rated faux original art",3,11,26,29 May 2012
Contact," One of the best movies ever made
","Young genius Ellie is encouraged by her blue collar dad to channel her talents into astronomy ,as he lacks the funds for private school or tutors.As they are about to watch a stellar event he has a massive heart attack.leaving her completely alone. Gifted astronomer Ellie Arroway is working on the seti project hunting for aliens by listening to radio chatter from deep space.As she moves around from Arecibo to New Mexico not making attachments to anyone ,it seems like her footsteps are dogged by the presidents science adviser David drumlin who shuts down projects ,cancels funding and is very condescending of her chosen speciality. And then she receives a signal...A lot of people criticised the movie for various reasons the most famous one being the south park comment 'waited 3 hours to see the aliens and it was her god**** father'. those people missed the point of the film entirely .There is nothing they could have possibly ever done with the aliens that would have pleased the audience with a 3 hour build up,so they didn't try.The film was of a strangely spiritual bent and seeing her old dad again fit in perfectly with this.In the end Ellie ask her disbelieving planet for 'faith' that the journey actually occurred at all. A very great majestic triumph of movie",10,0,2,9 March 2013
Alien: Covenant," Film relies on a twist that's screamingly obvious an hour before it happens
","An unasked for sequel to a film no one liked . I was ready to give the film a go despite its exceptionally bland cast of xeno fodder. About half way through the movie David starts to cut his long hair off and suddenly closely resembles Walter.At this point i realized he was going to pull the old switcheroo and betray the crew in the guise of Walter. and that's exactly what happened. What this film lacks in subtlety it makes up for in being completely bleedin obvious,even to a fool.What is supposed to be a shocking twist that puts the icing on the cake of this film is the final insult the viewer cannot bare. So it manages to be even more pointless than Prometheus and keep all the pretensions. Look upon this movie and despair",4,6,12,19 May 2017
