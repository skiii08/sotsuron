Ford v Ferrari," It was so cool...
","From a hard core Ferrari fan it is a great deal to accept that I rooted for Miles all the way :D The racing scenes were really good and exciting, the tempo of the movie was right for me and the '60s mood was enjoyable too. :) If you love cars or watching car-racing, this movie is perfect for you. #goferrari #themustangwasgorgeoustoo",10,2,3,9 January 2020
