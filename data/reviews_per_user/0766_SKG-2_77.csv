The Rock," Good work by leads can't save this 'crock'
","The late critic Jay Scott, from The Globe and Mail, once wondered whether directors Adrian Lyne and Ridley Scott were in fact the same person, given their too-similar-for-comfort styles.  I'd like to pose a similar scenario; that producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver are in fact, one and the same person; they both wear beards, and with a few exceptions(ENEMY OF THE STATE and THE REF for the former, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and THE MATRIX for the latter), they both make obnoxiously loud and dumb action movies.  What's worse, they get some talented people to work for them, and then crush them under the weight.  Sometimes, the actors are able to make it work(Eddie Murphy in BEVERLY HILLS COP for the former, Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, and Alan Rickman in DIE HARD for the latter), but mostly not.THE ROCK is the latest example from Silver...excuse me, Bruckheimer.  It's about average.  Again, the only distinction is good work by the three leads. Connery probably deserves the most praise, because he's saddled with lines like the 'prom queen' one, and still comes off looking good.  But for crying out loud, he co-produced this crap!  Cage claims to have taken this so his career wouldn't take a nose dive after LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and he does a good job in the role, but I'm tired of all the excuses actors use to appear in these monstrosities.  Here's a new one; WHY DON'T YOU READ THE F***ING SCRIPT!!!  Yes, what can be good in the script stage can still be screwed up, but if you're not obligated(by your contract or a friend), and you don't need the money, YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS CRAP!!!  Sorry.  Anyway, Harris, to be fair, has a more dimensional role than normal for these movies, and he does it well.  His scene with Michael Biehn(also good) is one of the film's high points.  Also, there's an admittedly tense scene on the 'rock.'  But mostly, this follows the MO of Bruckheimer/Silver; Thou shalt bludgeon thy audience rather than entertain them.",5,3,6,14 September 1999
The Devil's Advocate," Would you like fried ham with that?
","I have to admit something; whenever movies get serious about the mystical parts of religion, I tend to duck for cover, with rare exceptions, and this movie ain't one of them.  True, director Hackford did what he could and managed to milk some entertainment out of it, Pacino may have chewed the scenery, but at least he was entertaining at it, and Charlize Theron shows once again she's going places.  But come on!  The climax, as with most of the movie, was overwrought and melodramatic, and the whole time during the movie, I kept thinking, 'If the devil's as powerful as everybody says, wouldn't he be more subtle?'  I mean, really.",5,2,6,18 February 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Entertaining and scary
","A lot of the reviews of this film have said the reason this is so good is it doesn't show anything, it lets you imagine it all, and that's the only way to make horror.  I think that's more than a bit simplistic.  After all, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EXORCIST, THE SHINING, and many other films cited as classics show a lot(if THE SHINING was truly 'suggestive,' would we have seen the blood coming from the elevator?).  Nevertheless, they are right in praising this film.  It is entertaining and scary, and you do care about the three filmmakers and what happened to them.  It's not the best thing I've ever seen, but I had a good time at it.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Antz," Solid effort from DreamWorks
","Overall, I'd have to say this film is a solid first effort from DreamWorks. The animation could be a tad more colorful (I preferred A BUG'S LIFE in this department), and the story bogged down at times.  However, it's nice to see an animated film trying for more than just mush, but actually try to say something, even if it wasn't quite sure what it was saying at times.  Also, casting Woody Allen as the voice of Z was a stroke of genius.  Like Robin Williams in ALADDIN, he makes it funny just by showing up.  The other actors doing voices were all good as well.  Finally, it was nice not to suffer through badly written songs for the movie, but hearing good songs, like 'I Can See Clearly Now' and 'Almost Like Being in Love,' being used.",8,0,0,3 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Okay, but not worth the hype
","George Lucas certainly deserves credit for changing the way movies look, but it seems he's forgotten some things as a storyteller.  The original STAR WARS, as you may remember, was culled together from a whole bunch of sources; people today keep trumpeting Joseph Campbell as the primary influence, but let's not forget Flash Gordon serials, Kurosawa films(particularly THE HIDDEN FORTRESS), and THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD), not to mention the science fiction/fantasy novels like the FOUNDATION trilogy and THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  I had some problems with the first STAR WARS, but its grab bag of influences helped lend it an air of unprententiousness that was cheering.  And, of course, when things got too leaden, there was Harrison Ford as Han Solo to lighten things up.Now we have the new one.  Like the first three, this has awesome special effects, and the look is incredible.  And the action scenes are quite good. But the dialogue is incredibly wooden(it brings to mind what Ford said to Lucas during the first one, 'You can write this s--t, George, but you sure can't say it'), and all the actors deliver it in a stilted matter(with exceptions I'll get to later).  In the first one, since I never knew who Ford, Carrie Fisher, or Mark Hamill were before I saw it(or even Alec Guinness), it didn't seem so bad, because they had a fresh, callow look to them, and they at least seemed to believe what they were saying.  But you've got some great actors here; Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, and Natalie Portman, and they're all hamstrung by the dialogue.  Also, they all look like they'd rather be somewhere else.  Portman at least has moments when she's not dressed up like something out of a horror movie, but those are few.  The only one who escapes this trap is Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker.  He at least acts like a kid, but there's no hint of him becoming Darth Vader in the future.  Perhaps that will come out next time.In addition, the story is somewhat confusing at times, and seems misplaced in movie like this(taxes?).  Finally, there's the matter of Jar Jar Binks and some of the other aliens.  Unlike many, I liked the Ewoks in Jedi, but Jar Jar Binks brought back memories of Stepin Fetchit and Butterfly McQueen, and if the aliens Senator Palpatine(Ian McDirmarid does a good job) enlists to do his dirty work were intended to show off Lucas' Kurosawa influence, they instead come off as Charlie Chan stereotypes.  Only Darth Maul seems free from this, but they give him a motive of revenge without explaining it.Then again, with all the hype, it's hard to give a really objective opinion here.  I didn't walk out unhappy, but it's certainly not worth all the hype.",7,1,2,26 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great throwback movie
","Even if, like me, you're not a connoisseur of old adventure movies or serials (I've seen a few, but not a lot), you can enjoy this movie. Spielberg and Lucas, as one critic said, are not here making a demographic movie(which today's so-called blockbuster movies are), but a movie based on what they themselves wanted to see, and the result is pure entertainment from start to finish.  It's inconceivable that anyone other than Harrison Ford could have played this part, and Karen Allen measures up quite nicely as Marion, being much tougher than you might expect from this type of movie. A classic!",10,0,1,15 March 1999
Casablanca," 'You must remember this...'
","Though IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES, STAGE DOOR, ALL ABOUT EVE, and many many others I can't think of right now are very close, CASABLANCA is my favorite from the so-called 'classic' era of Hollywood.  It brings together all the elements of entertainment and transcends them into a work of art.  Story, direction, music, theme, acting, dialogue; all are operating at perfection here.  If studios were regularly turning out movies like these today, the movie industry wouldn't be in any trouble.  Pauline Kael once said CITIZEN KANE was more fun than any other great movie she could think of.  For me, it's this one.  A masterpiece.",10,1,1,4 March 1999
G.I. Jane," Maybe Demi Moore does have what it takes
","I fully admit I am not the biggest Demi Moore fan in the world.  As a matter of fact, she's been in some of my least favorite movies of the decade (A FEW GOOD MEN, INDECENT PROPOSAL, THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR, STRIPTEASE), and she really hasn't been good in any of those.  But she did win me over in this movie, because she lives up to her character's line, 'Look, I'm not trying to make any sort of statement here.'  And she isn't.  Instead of letting vanity get in the way, or injecting pathos, she lets her actions speak for her, just like her character does in trying to win acceptance as a SEAL.  The haircut scene is a good example; though it's directed with cinematic flourish, she does it matter-of-fact.Moore's performance is one of the two performances that elevate this from your standard grunts-become-soldiers movie.  The other is the riveting Viggo Mortenson as the Master Chief, who's the drill instructor.  He doesn't play the role as a sadistic tyrant, but rather as a subtle manipulator who gradually recognizes Jordan O'Neill(Moore) is someone worth taking seriously.  He also avoids going for pathos.The movie is best when it concentrates on the training.  Ironically, making just a standard grunts-become-soldiers movie makes its message work, because like O'Neill's superiors, we take her seriously because she becomes no different than anyone else.  The beginning is bad, and the climatic battle at the end is overblown, which weakens the movie.  Still, it's worth a look, and I maintain Moore was only given a Razzie Award for this movie and performance because of her past work, and the naysayers really weren't paying attention to her performance here.",8,84,112,22 February 1999
The Big Lebowski," Careful, man, it's a Coen brothers movie!
","Some critics thought this film was for die-hard Coen brothers fans only. Fortunately, I'm one of them, so I found this hysterical.  Sure, it meandered, but that was the point.  When Hollywood comedies are at an all-time nadir, we should be grateful for movies like this, which made me laugh consistently throughout.  Jeff Bridges was perfect, and the rest of the cast was equally wonderful.  One long trip, but highly enjoyable.",9,1,2,2 February 1999
Fight Club," Not as provocative as it thinks, but still a hit
","I was looking forward to this since I'm a fan of David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter, and since I read and liked the novel.  For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end.  Not the plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays much better in the movie.  Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary.  Still, this is almost nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting story, so you're carried along.  And all three leads are terrific, as is the supporting cast(including an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto, formerly of MY SO-CALLED LIFE, going blond here).",9,4,10,22 October 1999
As Good as It Gets," Lives up to its title
","I'm a big James L. Brooks fan, so I was anxiously awaiting this movie, and though I preferred the original title (OLD FRIENDS), that proved to be my only complaint.  Brooks is one of the masters at combining comedy with drama, and he's also great at writing dialogue (the 'noodle salad' speech is a highlight).  I should also say though I'm not familiar with Mark Andrus' work, he obviously deserves credit for writing the original script, which Brooks re-wrote.A lot has been said about Nicholson, but let me just say this; I have friends who work with obsessive-compulsive people, and people who suffer similar disorders, and they said Nicholson captured what being an obsessive-compulsive is to a T.  I also liked how gradual he changed, that his progress is slow, and that he still makes mistakes when he's unsure (like when Carol comes on to him and he asks her to sleep with Simon).There also seems to be a backlash against Hunt, and I for one would like to nip that in the bud.  A single mom is the type of role that other actresses might use to call attention to themselves, but Hunt never does.  And again, she concentrates on building her character gradually as well, and making her recognizable (the fact that the only way she can thank the doctor(Harold Ramis) who helps her son is to hug him, even though they don't know each other and he's obviously embarrassed).  Finally, Kinnear gives his first really good performance as Simon.  All in all, an excellent film!",10,1,1,16 February 1999
Amistad," Spielberg avoids COLOR PURPLE trap with powerful drama
","When he directed THE COLOR PURPLE in 1985, Spielberg was accused, rightly I thought, for simplifying the subject matter, and many raised the suitability for him directing movies about the African-American experience.  This film should put those doubts to rest.  It's a worthy and powerful film, although it should be said there are flaws.  Morgan Freeman is wasted as an abolitionist, and there are some scenes which don't come off (the 'give us free' scene, for example).  Also, this is an enormously complex tale, and sometimes it seems too complex for Spielberg.Still, those flaws, for the most part, pale beside the power of the film. Particularly the opening sequence when the slaves are captured, which ranks with the storming of the ghetto in SCHINDLER'S LIST and the D-Day sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as Spielberg's most powerful sequences on film. Although most of the film is a courtroom drama, it never feels slowed down or like a TV movie of the week, because Spielberg doesn't always go for the easy answer.  Many were not fans of Matthew McConaughey's performance, but not only did I like him here, I also liked how his character was portrayed, as you don't think to find a character as pragmatic as his is in a tale like this.  Of course, the real stars here are Hounsou and Hopkins, and they both deliver the goods.  While I'm glad Hopkins was nominated for an Oscar, I wish Hounsou had been as well; he's magnetic and a very good actor.  All in all, a good film which deserved better, and it doesn't come off as a history lesson.",9,1,3,15 February 1999
Shakespeare in Love," American actors do well in great Shakespeare movie
","The problem with Shakespeare in America today is we treat it like medicine; it tastes bad, but it's good for you.  I hope this wonderful and fun movie puts that notion to rest once and for all.  This works on so many levels it's hard to describe them all, but I would like to single out the two American actors, since one of the knocks they usually get is they can't do Shakespeare or English accents.  I've liked Paltrow since FLESH AND BONE in 1993, and here, she gives a performance full of zest, heart, humor, and shows the joy of acting at its purest.  I had doubts about Affleck at first, but he was nicely satirical, did a convincing accent, and unlike his character, wisely chose not to hog the spotlight.  Truly, one of the best films of the year.",10,0,0,2 February 1999
Seven Years in Tibet," Too long but still worth it
","The main problem with this film, and indeed with many films set in the outdoors, is that it's too long.  Maybe it's because I'm a product of the city and the suburbs, but to me, most movies set in the outdoors that don't use the scenery to advance the plot or set the mood, but rather just want to gaze at it, bore me quickly.  It's like, 'Yes, it's beautiful, let's move on.'  Also, though I like Brad Pitt, he doesn't always do the job with his Austrian accent; even when he gets it down, you're always thinking, 'That's Brad Pitt doing an Austrian accent,' rather than, 'That's Heinrich Harrer.' And that whole subplot about Harrer missing the son he's never seen doesn't work.Still, there is much to like in this film.  In many of these 'white men in strange country' movies, the emphasis is on what the white man teaches the people in the other country, and that's somewhat condescending; here, it's on what the people in the other country teach Harrer, yet his story isn't made more important than the story of the Tibet people.  Also, though his accent doesn't convince, Pitt is convincing as Harrer in the physical sense; he looks like a former skier and like the blond, blue-eyed ideal of the Nazis.  And finally, he's convincing in taking us through Harrer's transformation.Two more things; one, someone in their comments wondered how the Dalai Lama knew so much about Western culture.  According to the book, Harrer found the Dalai Lama to be quite curious about the world around him, so he studied what he could.  Also, the film meets head-on the controversy about Harrer being a former Nazi; it doesn't soft-pedal his past at all, which makes his transformation that much more convincing.",8,39,67,27 February 1999
12 Angry Men," A couple of problems but still very good
","First of all, I have a couple of problems with this movie which keeps this from being a classic for me.  First of all, I recognize that this is a different time than now, but I find it hard to believe that a defense lawyer would allow such obviously prejudiced jurors like the ones played by Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb onto the jury.  Even if he was just the public defender, it seems to me he'd have some sense.  Also, again even though this was a different time, I read an article by Alan Dershowitz who points out there's no way Henry Fonda would have been able to bring a knife into the deliberation room.  Nevertheless, this is still a good film, because it really explores what reasonable doubt truly means, and it showcases some excellent acting.  Sidney Lumet also does a good job directing his first film.",9,0,0,15 March 1999
The English Patient," Excellent film best of 1996
","Once again, it seems I must rise to defend yet another film from the most prevalent syndrome of the 90's; yes, the backlash syndrome.  No sooner does a film that is popular with critics, audiences, or both, than comes a knee-jerk instinct for someone to say, 'If other people like it, or love it, this must stink!'  I'm not denying there were people who honestly didn't like this, but if there's one trend I'd like to see disappear, it's the backlash syndrome.Anyway, I thought this film was terrific.  First, it looked stunning, and director Anthony Minghella gave each story a distinct look, from the browns and whites of the desert, and the past love affair between Almasy and Catherine, to the rainbow like colors of Italy, and the story of Hana taking care of the mysterious 'English Patient.'  As big a fan as I am of dialogue scenes, what I remember from this movie is some of the images, especially the scene with Hana looking at wall murals while going up and down on a rope line.  Second, he takes the story of the novel (which I liked) and makes it more accessible without losing the essentially elliptic tone.  So the two stories - Almasy and Catherine, Hana and Kip(and, essentially, ghosts) - come together without being sentimental.  Lastly, the performances.  Like their stories, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche create two different women, one cool on the outside and passionate on the inside, the other vice versa.  Like one critic pointed out, it's like both are joined together in Almasy's mind, since they're two sides of the same coin.  And Ralph Fiennes continues his string of excellent performances, being caustic and remote while hiding a deep and smoldering love for Catherine, and then turning around and being fatalistic and witty to comfort Hana.  This was my favorite film of 1996, and it stands that way, no matter what the 'backlash' crowd feels.",10,3,5,29 March 1999
Elizabeth," Great actress highlight of great movie
","I knew Cate Blanchett had talent after OSCAR AND LUCINDA, but even I was blown away by her performance here.  Only Billy Bob Thornton in A SIMPLE PLAN, Gwyneth Paltrow in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come close.  She captures the heart, drive, intelligence, vulnerability, and ruthlessness of the 'Virgin Queen.'  I think my favorite scene is early on when she is summoned by her sister, leaves, and is afraid she's going to be executed by the soldiers around her, but instead bluffs her way past, overhears Norfolk chewing the soldiers out for letting her bluff her way through, and then laughs.  She deserved the Golden Globe, and I hope she wins the Oscar.The rest of the film is excellent as well.  I think some people were looking for a stuffy costume drama, but I liked how modern the technique was; all those dark rooms and moving camera shots added to the intrigue.  Geoffrey Rush may get a nomination for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but he's much better here, trully Machieavellian as her closest and most ruthless ally.  I wasn't a fan of Kapur's THE BANDIT QUEEN, but this is excellent filmmaking.",10,0,1,2 February 1999
The Fifth Element," Highly entertaining junk food
","Dumb doesn't always have to be just dumb, you know.  There is such a thing as good dumb fun, and this movie provides it in spades.  The prologue was somewhat misconceived, though I guess it was necessary for plot purposes, but once things kicked in with the future, it was entertaining.  Luc Besson knows how to make entertaining junk food, as he did with 'Nikita' and 'The Professional', and he does it again here.  For one thing, he takes the time to create a dazzling world that also makes sense.  It's colorful, eye-popping, and visionary.  For another, while the story is pretty standard, it's told with style, wit, and verve.Except for one or two over-the-top performances per film, it seems Besson favors deadpan acting as a form of humor, and the actors here are well-suited to it.  Willis can be monotonous in films like 'The Last Boy Scout', but here, he's got something to react to, and he does it well.  Ian Holm lends a touch of gravity to the film, as always.  Milla Jovovich is just fine as Leeloo, playing as if things were just occuring to her.  The two over-the-top performances, of course, come from Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman.  I can see why some thought Tucker annoying, but I thought he was funny.  But, of course, he was no match for Oldman, who, as he proved in 'The Professional', is an entertaining villain.  His voice (which he claimed was a cross between Ross Perot and Bugs Bunny) was even funny.  All in all, check your brain at the door and have a good time.",9,0,1,19 February 1999
That Thing You Do!," Light but charming film
","Overall, I have to say I enjoyed Hanks' feature directing debut(this is not, by the way, the first time he sat in the director's chair; he directed a segment of a Showtime film noir series; I think it was called CITY OF ANGELS).  He did a convincing job not only recreating the time, but also the music, which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead; Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet, but as this film shows, he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always, Hanks does well playing a company man, and Liv Tyler is quite luminous(though I could have done without the 'thousand kisses' speech; that was melodramatic).  On the down side, I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech, but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still, this was overall an enjoyable movie.",8,20,31,21 October 1999
L.A. Confidential," Hollywood in the best sense
","This is a Hollywood film in the best sense of the word, and in almost every sense of the word.  This is a triumph of taste, intelligence, craftsmanship, writing, direction, music, acting, design, in short, pretty much everything. There is not one bad thing I can say about this film.  Curtis Hanson and co-writer Brian Helgeland deserve a lot of credit for taking a complex novel and making it work on the screen, even though they had to cut a lot of good stuff out.  Hanson also pushes himself in the big leagues with his directing, because he really feels close to the material, whereas in his previous films, you just got the sense of a competent craftsman.  The acting is also sensational, and though I wasn't rooting for her to get the Oscar (I would have voted for Julianne Moore with BOOGIE NIGHTS), Kim Basinger gave an excellent performance, no matter what the negative comments here have said.  The standout, however, is Russell Crowe, who not only is frightening when Bud White blows up, but shows vulnerability without going maudlin.  And for those who complain about the ending, it's in the novel.",10,2,3,24 February 1999
X-Men," Very good comic book movie
","One of the never-ending debates about popular culture is whether it reflects the times or dictates them.  I tend toward the former view, and comic books are no exceptions to this rule.  Batman and Superman, the popular comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's, came during the Depression and WWII, where people wanted larger-than-life heroes to look up to.  Whereas in the 60's and 70's, when society was becoming ripped apart and people were feeling confused and didn't trust society, comic book heroes like Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, who had as many everyday problems as they did evil ones, were the popular heroes.  Square in that tradition are the X-Men.I was only a casual reader of the comics when I grew up; it was more the excellent animated series of several years back I became a fan of.  It was on late at night, and the times shifted around so I couldn't always watch, but I enjoyed watching the adventures of Professor X, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue, and the others, and how they struggled to find their place in the world and to help other mutants do the same.  Now, director Bryan Singer and a host of writers(in addition to credited writers Singer, Tom DeSanto, and David Hayter, writers including John Logan, Christopher McQuarrie, Ed Solomon, and Joss Whedon took a whack at it) have delivered their version of X-MEN, and I'm pleased to say it delivers.One of the reasons it works is Singer, his usual director of photography, Newton Thomas Sigel, and production designer John Myhre eschew the usual look of comic book films.  Even though this is set in the future(the 'near future'), everything looks close to like it is today(except, of course, Magneto's hideout and Professor Xavier's school).  This emphasizes even more the alienation mutants feel from society.  And while there are visual effects used in both the battles and when the X-Men show their stuff(especially Mystique), they don't come at the expense of the story, but serve it.Some have complained the film is overly serious, as if being a comic book automatically meant it wasn't worth taking seriously.  Yes, Singer is making parallels to bigotry today, with some direct antecedents(the anti-mutant Senator Robert Kelly is clearly modeled on Joe McCarthy, Magneto is a Holocaust survivor, and he quotes Malcolm X near the end - 'by any means necessary' - which also suggests Professor Xavier is parallel to Martin Luther King), but they're handled well, and not overplayed.  It's also refreshing to see how little melodrama creeps in(SPOILER ALERT: When Professor Xavier becomes bedridden and the rest of the X-Men must carry on without him, it's good to see he doesn't suddenly come back just in time to save the day.  END SPOILER ALERT).  And to those who suggest the movie is without humor, there are jokes both visual(I don't know the characters, but at the school, one boy makes a fireball, and another sneaks up behind him and turns it into ice.  Also, Wolverine's version of flipping someone the bird) and through dialogue(when Wolverine puts down the costumes everyone's wearing, Cyclops shoots back, 'Would you prefer yellow spandex?').One criticism of comic book movies has generally been that they spend too much time trying to explain things to people who don't know anything about them, all at the expense of the story.  That's certainly a valid point, but the stories of Wolverine and Rogue(though admittedly hers is supposedly changed radically from the source) are a good way of getting into the story, and Magneto's short past is necessary to show while he is a villain, he's not your standard one.  And the stories of Wolverine and Rogue provide an emotional counterpoint to the information disseminated about the X-Men(the fact that Patrick Stewart is handling the exposition keeps these scenes from bogging down).Which leads to the performances.  In order for this to work, you need actors with tremendous presence and authority to play Professor Xavier and Magneto, and someone who can fully handle the complexity of Wolverine, and this is where the film truly scores.  Stewart and Ian McKellen are terrific in their roles, both resisting the urge to camp it up(the fact that they sound alike also illustrates how the characters are two sides of the same coin), and especially play well together.  And while I had wanted Russell Crowe(the first name mentioned during casting talks) for Wolverine, newcomer Hugh Jackman does quite well, capturing all the feelings Wolverine feels, plus having a great physical presence.  And he also does a great job working with all the other actors, and acting with his face(SPOILER ALERT: especially in the scene when he rescues Rogue near the end. END SPOILER ALERT)The rest of the cast is more of a mixed bag.  On the minus side, Tyler Mane has very little to do as Sabretooth, though Magneto and Mystique are the main villains here anyway.  Halle Berry has a great physical presence as Storm, her battle scenes come off well, and she's quietly powerful in her one dramatic scene with Senator Kelly, but her African accent(Storm, of course, lived there much of her life) is wayward, and she gets stuck with some awkward dialogue(her scene with Wolverine).  And while James Marsden is appropriately cocky as Cyclops, and spars well with Wolverine, isn't quite convincing as a leader, in his one dramatic scene(with Professor Xavier), he's wooden rather than moving, and he and Jean Gray don't have much chemistry(in fairness, that was probably among the footage cut out after previews).  On the plus side, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos only has one line of dialogue, but she's quite a presence as Mystique; she's a visual effect all to herself.  And unlike the tiresome face-swapping of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, her shape-shifting never becomes tiresome, because it's always used right, for terror or a joke.  Ray Park also makes a good presence as Toad, and contributes some humor as well.  Bruce Davison doesn't overplay as Kelly, but brings the right amount of edge.  Famke Jannsen brings quiet strength to Jean Gray, and her scenes with Wolverine sparkle(especially when she looks into his mind).  Finally, while some have complained that Rogue is too passive a character, I would argue it's appropriate for this conception; she doesn't use her power in fights because she hasn't learned to control it, and is afraid to use it.  And Anna Paquin captures this emotional confusion well, especially with her scenes with Wolverine(along with McKellen and Stewart, Jackman and Paquin are the best pair in the film).Overall, this was quite a good effort, and while I'm normally leery of sequels, the same people are back for the second film, so I'm looking forward to it.",8,1,2,17 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Good until last 1/3
","It seems strange that I would be a Tim Burton fan, I think, because I've seen little of the movies which influenced him as a kid(the old-style horror and science-fiction movies) and am more of a fan of narrative fiction than he is(I can't remember if I've included this story or not, but here goes; I read an interview where Daniel Waters, one of the writers on BATMAN RETURNS, talked about how he looked forward to writing Burton's first coherent narrative, only to be turned around by Burton being the equivalent of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling Luke, 'Use the force!').  But I think he's funny, visually inventive, and has surprising depth.  I think he was the wrong person to do the BATMAN movies, but I've enjoyed all of his other movies, especially EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, which, by coincidence, both happen to be the movies starring Johnny Depp.  So it follows I was eagerly looking forward to SLEEPY HOLLOW, their latest collaboration.For about 2/3 of the way, this was good.  The look, as usual, was stunning, and he does a good job of creating tension, menace, and atmosphere.  The five character actors playing the town's leading citizens(including Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones, who appeared in BEETLEJUICE and ED WOOD) add to that menace.  The sound of the sword alone was scary.  Christina Ricci doesn't get a lot to do, but she does look lovely, and looks appropriate to the period and the town.  As for Depp, this is a parody of sorts from him; he's applying the Ichabod Crane of the original story and playing him as if he really were a police constable(If he had played it straight, the movie would have felt wrong from the beginning).  This is most apparent in the scene where he's using gadgets to explain what is already obvious to the rest of the town.The problem, however, comes when it's time to wrap things up.  One of the screenwriters here is Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote SEVEN.  That was a serial killer movie with a difference, which didn't follow a traditional formula, but was disturbing and original.  Here, however, we get the feeling that he felt, despite Burton's attachment and the story's horror roots, this was in essence a serial killer movie, and gave it a conventional ending.  In retrospect, without giving anything away, the ending is logical, but it hangs on a couple of details which are barely  on-screen, and is handled so flatly that the movie bogs down, just when it's supposed to excite us most. Also, some of the characters involved are so sketchy, the explanations about them feel last-minute to cover up weak parts of the story.  If someone had found a less literal-minded ending, I think that would have worked better. As it is, it's a good film, but it's Burton's first non-BATMAN film I've had problems with.",8,2,4,1 December 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Still relevant
","Unlike other Stanley Kubrick films, which often need repeat viewings before I completely get them, this one I got right on the first try.  And okay, so the Cold War is over (though I'm sure there are people in America who still wish they had communism as a straw man).  With nuclear weapons still out there, and the chances of terrorist groups of all kinds being able to get their hands on them, and the gun mentality which pervades the militaries of the world, this is still timely and hilariously funny, as it shows the people in charge for the idiots that they are.  Sure, it's cynical, but wouldn't you be?Sellers, of course, deserves to be commended, and Slim Pickens assured his place in history with his riding the bomb down like a horse.  George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Keenan Wynn, however, usually get overlooked, and they're equally funny without ever trying to be.  A masterpiece.",10,1,2,15 March 1999
The Godfather: Part II," Achieves the impossible
","As I've said before, I really hate sequels.  Technically, this may not strictly be a sequel (since half of this, the flashback half, was in the original novel), but what the hell; this is the rare sequel which is not only great, but improves on the original.  If you held a gun to my head and asked me what my favorite movie was of all time, this would be the one. Though I disagree with Coppola, who felt he romanticized the Corleones in Part I, without that feeling, there would have been no Part II, and we must thank him for that.The way time passes from present to pass effortlessly, the way we see how past affects present, the way the story of Michael Corleone achieves the level of Greek tragedy, the direction, the performances, the score, everything comes together even deeper than in the first one.  But the primary reason to see this is Al Pacino.  It is my humble opinion that not only is this the best of his five great performances from 1972-75 (the others being THE GODFATHER, SCARECROW, SERPICO, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON), it is the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, period (Liv Ullman's performance in PERSONA is the best performance by an actress I have seen). Michael Corleone becomes more closed off as he achieves power.  He alienates friends, family, even the people who work for him, because he completely closes himself off from humanity.  Yet we feel for him, partly because Pacino NEVER plays for our sympathy, but gives a closed performance.  It's easy to overact, it's hard to play still and close to the vest, and Pacino chooses the more difficult path.  We also feel for him because we can sense Michael acts this way because it's the only way he feels he can run things. If he ever came out of his detachment, he'd have to admit he was a failure and was being immoral(which he does in Part III).  A masterpiece.",10,0,0,5 March 1999
Notting Hill," Not as good the second time around
","Perhaps it is unfair to compare this film to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, even though the writer and star of that film(Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant) have re-teamed for a similarly-themed romantic comedy(English man falls for American beauty who may be out of his league).  And I don't think Grant has played the same the same character over and over again(there's not much in common between his roles in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, SIRENS, and EXTREME MEASURES, for example, not to mention AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE).  But he certainly does a carbon copy of his performance in FOUR WEDDINGS here. Worse, while he was able to display a range of emotions in that film, and even get in on some of the film's funny bits(the best man speech), here, the only emotion he's allowed to display is wistfulness, and a little of that goes a long way.  You just wish that he'd get angry once.Julia Roberts fares a little better, though she's underplaying as if she expected she'd have something much more raucous to play against.  She of course is playing someone who has to have a facade on at all times, but she does get to show other facets, like petulance(when the others around her are saying how miserable their lives are, and she feels left out), humor(when she shows up a group of diners talking about her as if she was a whore), and anger(when the press shows up outside Grant's door).  Still, I wish the satire on movie stars' lives had been more pronounced; what's there is good(the press junkets, the discussion of stunt bottoms), but I was left hungry for more.Oddly enough, the most blatant copy of FOUR WEDDINGS - the friends Grant has - is the part which worked best for me, because at least the people their had personalities to express, and they never let the sentimentality get too heavy(when one of them is in a wheelchair, you prepare for the worst, but Emma Chambers(I think she's the actress) deflects that by never playing for pathos).  Also, Rhys Ifans steals the movie, and it sorely needs him. Overall, not bad, but could have been better.",7,0,0,9 June 1999
He Got Game," Spike Lee does it again
","Lee continues to show why he's one of the best filmmakers of the 90's with this film.  It's also one of the best basketball films ever made, along with HOOP DREAMS and WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.  While Lee's passion for the game is evident, he also shows the pressures put on athletes from all sides; school, family, people who want to live through the athletes, people who think being an athlete automatically requires you to be a role model, groupies and other temptations, and, of course, money.  Along with the basketball story, Lee also adds a nicely drawn and realistic father-son relationship.  Washington is of course in excellent form, but the surprise here is NBA player (for Milwaukee?) Ray Allen, who not only handles the basketball scenes well, but is a convincing actor.  The soundtrack was really good as well.",10,0,1,5 February 1999
American Psycho," Biting yet chilling satire
","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEADI first read Ellis' novel a year ago.  While much of it was overwritten, particularly the gore parts, within it was a biting yet chilling satire, from the concentration of what Patrick wore to what he listened to(the record reviews, written with the same depth as one might expect a review of The Who's TOMMY would have, are hysterical), which exposed an entire empty sub-culture.  I'm glad director and co-writer(with Guinevere Turner, who also plays one of Patrick's victims) Mary Harron found that satire in her film, while playing down the gore(though the murders still retain their kick).  One could argue some of it is so 80's it's passe, but then again, given the way a new generation of people are driven to success at any cost, maybe it's not just the 80's.Bale does a good job of capturing Patrick, being both funny and terrifying, often at the same time, and yet showing that the person he most terrifies is himself.  The other actors are all good, particularly Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's secretary, and makes it believable that she's the one person he would spare.  A couple of points on what people have written; if the other characters seem shallow, that's partly because that's how Patrick sees them. Also, I don't think we're supposed to think he imagined it all; I think his friends just don't believe a serial killer may be in their midst(which is why Harron keeps Ellis' last line 'THIS IS NOT AN EXIT' on the door behind Patrick).",8,2,5,20 April 2000
North by Northwest," Hitch's best
","Hitchcock always called PSYCHO his 'fun' picture.  It seems to me this film, which is my favorite of his, would fit that term better (though PSYCHO, a great film, may have been more fun for him, because it was probably less of a hassle physically to shoot, and because it appealed to his warped sense of humor), since this basically kids the genre he helped invent, the suspense thriller.  The plot, when you think about it, is a remake of his own THE 39 STEPS, and although I'm not a Hitchcock expert, others could probably point out echoes of other of his films in this one.  At the same time, it still manages to be quite suspenseful.Cary Grant was one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and it's easy to see why; he lends a class and glamour to the film, yet allows himself to be put in all sorts of sticky situations which he is able to escape from, no matter how narrowly.  Eve Marie Saint is one of the best leading ladies he ever had, generating not only sex appeal but mystery.  Leo G. Carroll is quite good as The Professor, and I wonder if he was an inspiration for George Smiley.  Martin Landau is slimy as Leonard.  But besides Grant, the best performance here is by James Mason, who avoids going over-the-top to just ooze malice.  I especially liked his last line; 'Not very sporting, using real bullets.'  There are so many classic scenes it's hard to list them all, and Bernard Hermann's score is excellent as well.",10,3,5,15 March 1999
U-571," Nothing new, but still good
","Three years ago, Jonathan Mostow made a neat little thriller called BREAKDOWN, and while there was nothing in it we hadn't seen before, it was still good.  Now he turns the same trick with this movie.  True, it's not a classic like DAS BOOT was, but if we said that about every movie('well, it's no...'), we'd have no movies.  I was caught up with most of it, and I enjoyed it.  Also, I liked Matthew McConaughey, who proved once again he's a better actor than given credit for, even when he's not using his trademark grin and charm.  Except for Harvey Keitel and Jack Noseworthy(who was also in BREAKDOWN), the rest of the cast wasn't distinctive, but they were good.Now to answer some of the criticism of this movie I've read: (1) It's not just that this is a fictional story and not fact, it's that the Enigma is a McGuffin; just something to get the plot rolling.  The real story is the crew trying to survive on the enemy submarine and McConaughey's character learning if he has what it takes to be a captain.  If we found out the characters were also supposed to be able to use the Enigma as well, that would have been a problem, but all they're doing is taking it. (2) If I remember correctly, and it could be I'm not, the German captain who orders his gunman to shoot the survivors on lifeboats says those are his orders from 'the Fuehrer.'  Of course, that's no excuse(given that following orders was the defense for My Lai), but we weren't meant to think, 'Oh, these German bad guys' because of this scene, especially since they didn't look particularly happy about it.On the other hand, I do agree one torpedo blowing up a destroyer was a little ludicrous.  But it does seem to me a lot of comments which nit-pick films like this are by people who go in not caring if the movie works as a whole, but who have to be satisfied about every little detail in the movie, and go through it as if they were studying something under a microscope. People like that, in my humble opinion, need to get a life.",8,1,9,25 April 2000
American Beauty," Much more than a male menopause movie
","You know how some ads may make one character or actor seem more important to the movie than they actually are?  AMERICAN BEAUTY is one movie where that isn't likely to happen, as I've seen three different kinds of ads for this movie; those emphasizing Kevin Spacey, those emphasizing Annette Bening, and those emphasizing Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari.  All of them get equal play in this movie.  From the reviews, you might think this was simply a male menopause movie, in the vein of LAST TANGO IN PARIS, but while we do get that, it fails to do this movie justice.  Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball present these people as people, rather than just one-dimensional idiots to hang a supposedly profound thesis onto(like the so-called profound HAPPINESS), so that we actually care about them and understand their actions.  And each of them gets their own story.For a theater director, Mendes also seems quite confident behind the camera as well.  His use of the camera and his willing to take chances visually are almost always compelling(though admittedly, the rose petal fetish got to be a bit much).  The use of music is also inspired(you may never listen to 'Bali Hai' the same way again), and special points for using the original of 'American Woman,' rather than some cover version(I usually have nothing against covers, but Lenny Kravitz(who I normally like) did an awful version of 'American Woman' for the AUSTIN POWERS sequel).  And the script also takes chances and goes for surprises, particularly in the last act.Finally, the performances.  It goes without saying Spacey is terrific, as is newcomer Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher add dimension to what could be stock characters.  Mena Suvari does the same to her character(the one Spacey becomes infatuated with), and she's part of the surprises at the end, which she handles convincingly.  And Alison Janney, a character actress I've long liked, is almost unrecognizable as Bentley's out-of-it mom.  But the two I want to spotlight are Birch and Bening.  I liked Birch in PARADISE and an 'Outer Limits' episode where she played a girl with telekinetic powers, but while she had moments in PATRIOT GAMES, she really hasn't had a role suitable to her talents since until this one. In interviews, Birch describes this as the 'Christina Ricci' role, and again, it may look that way on the surface, but there's so much more going on, and Birch handles it all convincingly.  As for Bening, I don't think she'd be my first choice for this type of role, but she handles it with ease, and hits the right comic note every time, especially at her scene on the firing range.  It's also fun to think of her character here as kin to Myra, the con artist she played in THE GRIFTERS.  In short, you think you have this movie pegged?  Look closer.",Null,0,1,29 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," It's my head!!!!
","Though I had liked the few Spike Jonze music videos I've seen(Weezer's 'Buddy Holly' and the Beastie Boys one), I was hesitant about whether he could make the jump to movies, for, as we know, for every good MTV raised director(David Fincher), there are several bad ones(Michael Bay).  And this is truly a concept which could have gone either way.  But this is one of the most original, funny, and enjoyable movie experiences I've had this year. Every idea pays off in ways you don't expect, all four main actors do well cast against type, and it's awfully hard to pick who's the best(though I suspect John Malkovich will be remembered at Oscar time), the dialogue is great('Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man!' may be the best line of the year), and I can't think of another way to describe this except go see it now.",10,70,115,1 December 1999
Face_Off," Best American action movie ever
","The reason why I like John Woo's Chinese films(what I've seen, anyway; 'The Killer', 'Once a Thief', 'Hard-Boiled') and dislike most American action films by comparison (or even not by comparison) is they feel like they were made by a human being, while American action films feel like they were ground out by a machine.  Woo films have plots which, while they may be implausible, are worth following, characters to care about, actors who get involved, and oh yes, spellbinding action.  Whereas American action films, except the few good ones, have stupid plots, monoliths as heroes, terrible dialogue, cardboard characters, and just one blowup scene after another.In 'Hard Target' and 'Broken Arrow', Woo had moments, but you could sense him being hemmed in by Hollywood.  With 'Face/Off', he finally gets to cut loose. Sure the story is implausible, but you don't think about it while you're watching it, because you're so caught up in it.  And unlike Hollywood action films, where you don't care about who gets killed because neither do the characters, here you do care.  Woo has said in interviews how much he liked old Hollywood musicals, and he choreographs his films like them.  'Hard Target' and Broken Arrow' didn't feel like that, but this one does.  And in Travolta and Cage, he has actors perfectly suited not only to his action flair, but also the operatic storyline.Travolta was flat as the bad guy in 'Broken Arrow', but here he gets to bring out his gift for parody, and he's quite enjoyable (and gets the film's best line; 'Lies, mistrust, mixed messages; this is turning into a real marriage').  He's also good as Archer.  The real story here, though, is Cage.  He's great as the bad guy, but when he's called on to provide the emotional heart of the film, he does it in spades, especially in the scene where he's Archer wearing Castor Troy's face for the first time.  The other actors are all good as well.  I hope American action filmmakers learn from this film and make more movies like this.",10,2,3,19 February 1999
Dark City," Kafkaesque tale dazzling to watch
","When I describe this movie to people, I always tell them if Kafka had written comic books, he might have turned out something like this.  Alex Proyas proves THE CROW was no fluke with this visually dazzling film.  He convincingly creates a world we can accept and marvel at, and he never breaks the rules he sets up.  I missed the emotional connection I felt with THE CROW, perhaps because while Rufus Sewell does a good job in the main role, he doesn't give us that connection.  Still, I found it compelling viewing.  Jennifer Connolly doesn't have a big role, but she adds to the level of weirdness we feel, since she has the most 'normal' role.  I was surprised to find William Hurt here, but he's very good.  Acting honors, however, go to Kiefer Sutherland, who's better than he's been in a long time.",9,0,2,4 February 1999
The Usual Suspects," Keyser Soze rules the world
","An ex cop named Christopher McQuarrie (or maybe he's an ex-detective; I read this somewhere but I don't completely remember it) gets an idea about putting five super-criminals into a police line-up.  He takes it to Bryan Singer, a director whom he collaborated with in Singer's first film PUBLIC ACCESS.  Singer says that police lineups never have five super-criminals, they have the criminal and four people who share a resemblance.  Then he thinks about it and says, wait a minute, under what circumstance would they be put in a line-up?The result, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is an enjoyable, twisty, thriller which is fun even as it entangles you in a complex plot, and then pulls the rug out with one more twist.  Curiously, I guessed that twist, then dismissed it out of hand, and then was proven right!  It did not stop me from enjoying it. It wasn't the best movie of that year (it was tied for #8 on my top ten with THE UNDERNEATH; ahead of it were LEAVING LAS VEGAS, NIXON, DEAD MAN WALKING, SMOKE, LE CONFESSIONAL, TWELVE MONKEYS, and THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY; behind it were ONCE WERE WARRIORS and SAFE), but it was the most fun.  This had a lot of comparisons to RESERVOIR DOGS, but whereas that excellent film was an ironic take on old heist films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS plays it straight.Everything comes together perfectly here; direction, writing (which assumes the audience is smart), music (which avoids most cliches when it comes to thrillers), colors, and yes, acting.  All of it is top-notch, with of course special kudos going out to Kevin Spacey.  Without ever 'indicating,' he creates a thoroughly believable cripple, plus he is a master storyteller, plus he's convincing both when he's defiant and when he's scared, or both, and when he's...but I should stop there.  If you like being surprised and thrilled, this is for you.",10,0,1,5 March 1999
Independence Day," If there's intelligent life out there, please save us from movies like this
","A friend of mine said that Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich weren't trying to make a demographic movie, but were honestly trying to make the type of movie that would entertain them, a la Spielberg.  That may be true (in fact, I'm inclined to believe it is), but you also need talent, and they fall short there.  The first half hour of the movie has problems which re-occur throughout(like Randy Quaid; never is he more annoying or condescending than when he's playing crazy types), but grabs us at least, and I can't deny the visceral effectiveness of watching the White House being blown up.  But then the story becomes cliche city.  The only actors who survive are Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum, because they at least are entertaining.  Some do solid work (Harry Connick Jr., Robert Loggia), some are wasted (Mary McDonnell, Bill Pullman), and some are awful (Quaid, James Rebhorn), and the movie is similarly patchwork.  This movie does not represent the end of civilization as we know it, but it's a sad state of affairs when this is the norm and not the exception.",7,1,2,4 April 1999
Man on the Moon," Thank you very much
","The first time I saw Andy Kaufman was on the Saturday Night Live 15th anniversary show.  In the clips from the first 5 years, they showed a few seconds of his Mighty Mouse thing, and I found it strange and funny.  Since then, I've seen him on old Saturday Night Live shows, and comedian specials, and seen a few old Taxi episodes(though I was never a big fan), and found him to be quite strange, but also quite funny.  So I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was not disappointed.I agree with the person who said to try and find out the mystery behind Kaufman would have undoubtedly gotten it wrong.  Instead, we get a look inside his art, and if you don't find him funny, you're not going to like this movie(and I have no problem with those who don't like the movie for that reason).  Viewers may also be thrown by the fact that the movie, as demonstrated in the opening scene, is a series of 'is that real or just a put on?' episodes(in a way, this reminded me of PENN AND TELLER GET KILLED, which is similarly constructed).  But it stays true to Kaufman and his performance style, and I found it offbeat and, yes, funny.I do have a couple of minor quibbles.  I don't know the entire story, but there are a couple of facts fudged.  For example, the way Kaufman left Saturday Night Live is not quite true(if they had done the true story, it would have been even funnier).  Also, Courtney Love is not as good as she was in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, though she does have moments.  But, as I said, those are minor quibbles.  Particularly high among the virtues is, of course, Jim Carrey as Kaufman.  It took me awhile for him to 'disappear' into the role, as so many people said he did, but he is amazing and constantly keeps us off balance and laughing, as does the entire movie.",10,9,20,28 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," If Spielberg hadn't directed it, this would get unanimous acclaim
","Like someone, I forget who, wrote in, I can't wait to see this again when it reopens on February 5.  Except for the last scene at the cemetery, which was unnecessary, I can't think of a film that's moved me more all year.  The fact that it's been coming under heavy criticism is yet another demonstration that a vocal minority of people have a bug up their a** when it comes to Steven Spielberg, and that's sad and shameful.  If he hadn't directed this film, it would get unanimous acclaim as the best film of the year.  But people can't handle that the man who made E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK would make a serious film about the horrors of war.  For those who say it's powerful battle scenes at the beginning and end and nothing but cliches in between, I say hogwash!  Is it a cliche when Tom Hanks' character is screaming at one of his soldiers not to save a child?  Ignore all the Spielberg bashers, and if you haven't seen it yet, see it, and if you have, see it again.",10,0,0,2 February 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Same strengths and weaknesses as the first one
","In retrospect, Spielberg's adaptation of JURASSIC PARK not only made sense in financial terms, but also artistic.  I didn't read THE LOST WORLD, but most of Crichton's novels, while they're well-plotted, are straitjackets, told in a clinical fashion, as if he's trying to tell you how much better he is than you.  And the characters are usually one-dimensional at best, with the exception of a few here and there.  Where the film versions of RISING SUN, DISCLOSURE, and CONGO kept most of the book, and therefore were held back by it, the film version of JURASSIC PARK threw out the book and just kept the dinosaurs, which made it more entertaining, so we could forget about the fact that the characters were one-dimensional and the plot is right out of a (bad) 1950's sci-fi movie.This sequel is, in most senses, a carbon copy of the original.  It has the same strengths (the dinosaurs, Jeff Goldblum) and weaknesses (lack of character development, watered-down story).  The primary difference is this is more of a straight-ahead action movie than the original, and Spielberg is in control there.  Also, Julianne Moore and Pete Postlethwaite do a lot with a little.",7,0,0,24 February 1999
Good Will Hunting," Liked it, didn't love it
","I'm not one of the people who said, 'Wow, this is the best movie I've ever seen!', but I did like it a lot.  I think the reason I didn't love it is I thought the conflict between the Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard characters was somewhat exaggerated for dramatic purposes, and I didn't always buy it.  I did like the relationships between the other characters, especially between the Matt Damon and Ben Affleck characters.  My favorite moment in the movie is Affleck's speech to Damon where he tells him his favorite part of the day is when he thinks Damon isn't there.  And Williams was really good.",9,3,9,22 February 1999
Schindler's List," Profound meditation on good and evil
","Steven Spielberg showed he could make grown-up movies with this powerful drama about the Holocaust and about one of the handful of people who tried to save Jews rather than kill them or allow them to be killed during this time.  It's unflinching in looking at the nature of good and the nature of evil.  The good is represented, at its most unlikely, in the form of Oskar Schindler, a womanizer, boozer, charmer, and money-grubber who nonetheless manages to do one good thing and save over a thousand lives.  Contrary to what some people have commented, he is not presented as a saint, but as a complex, enigmatic human being, and Liam Neeson plays him that way splendidly.  I do agree the scene where Schindler wishes he could have saved more feels misguided, but that's my only complaint about the film.On the other side of the coin is Ralph Fiennes, in an absolute chilling portrayal, as Amon Goeth, who represents evil here.  Yet like Schindler, his is not a simplistic portrayal, but is someone who doesn't feel anything, except contempt and maybe a little greed.  He kills not out of pathology but rather out of boredom.  The only time we see any feelings come over him is when he decides, as an experiment, to spare people who do wrong, rather than kill them, and it shakes him, so he goes back to killing.  Also he's undone by Helen Hirsch, his maid, so he lashes out at her even more than if it was just some servant.  The genius of the movie is to see him and Schindler as closer than we would like to think.  Also, Ben Kingsley is very good.Spielberg was trying to bring the reality of the Holocaust to people who didn't know about it, and maybe were being bombarded by all the hate groups who are spreading a disinformation campaign by saying it never happened.  And I think he suceeded brilliantly.",10,9,18,4 March 1999
The Game," Engrossing thrill ride
","If you're the type of person who comes to movies just for escapism, this is a good movie to watch.  It's a thrill ride that always keeps you guessing, yet it's enjoyable and keeps you glued.  John Brancato and Michael Ferris were also the credited writers on 'The Net', and like that underrated film, this asks the question; what if everything you took for granted was thrown out of whack?  Another way to see this is as the ultimate virtual reality movie.  And like any good director, David Fincher turns the screws so subtly that by the time you realize he's done it, you're hooked already.Michael Douglas, of course, has played so many yuppies he can do them in his sleep, but luckily he didn't here.  He even shows the man behind the facade here.  Sean Penn seems an unlikely choice, but he keeps you guessing.  One performer who gets overlooked usually is Deborah Kara Unger.  Her role may not be that big, but it's certainly key, and the ambiguity she radiates fits perfectly with the tone of the film.  Good character actors like James Rebhorn and Armin Mueller-Stahl also turn in memorable performances.  As for the ending, I can understand how some may have felt cheated, but I loved it.",10,0,1,19 February 1999

In the relationship between Donnie and Lefty, it also brings in a DEATH OF A SALESMAN tone, which is also well done.  Pacino, of course, has a good history with the gangster, having played Michael Corleone, and here, he brings the same ability and restraint to someone 180 degrees from Corleone.  You may hate what Lefty does, but you won't be able to stop thinking about him.  And Depp matches Pacino point for point in this, his first real adult role.  Credit should also go to director Newell and writer Paul Attanasio for the authentic feel this movie has.  The only complaint I have is Anne Heche (a wonderful actress) is wasted on the role of Donnie's wife, since it's a nothing part.",9,1,2,18 February 1999
Jerry Maguire," Cameron Crowe does it again
","Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers after only three films to his credit as director (he also wrote FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, which was a little rough around the edges but still good, and THE WILD LIFE, which was a huge mistake).  SAY ANYTHING and SINGLES were classics, and now comes JERRY MAGUIRE, which is the first time he's made a film about people his age or around that.  It manages to avoid being cynical and at the same time avoid being saccharine in its tale of a sports agent named Jerry Maguire who, thanks to a memo(or mission statement) that came from a brief bout of conscience, loses his job and his fiancee, and must not only claw himself back but admit to himself that he did in fact write that memo and really does believe in it.Tom Cruise has spent half of his career coasting, and half of it giving great performances when he works with a real director.  This fits in the latter category.  As the script shows Jerry's growth in small steps, so does Cruise.  It's not until he really has grown and has something to lose (his marriage) that he has a big emotional scene at the end, and this feels earned, rather than cheap, as it does in so many other movies.  And while he is the star here, Cruise doesn't horn in on everyone else, but really plays off of everyone else, and even allows them room to steal the movie.As for the rest, a lot has been said about Cuba Gooding Jr., and among the people who were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he would get my vote. He also felt honest and was funny and energetic.  And the rest of the cast is good as well.  But the real force, for me, anyway, came from Renee Zellweger.  I think it was Gene Siskel who said he felt the movie might have started out being more about sports, but when Zellweger was cast, it was shifted towards her character more simply because she lights up the screen. Now, from what I've read, I don't think the movie was edited towards her, but she certainly does light up the screen.  She has the two best moments of the movie; when she finds out Jerry's dumped his fiancee, the look on her face is incredible, and I also loved her line to Jerry after his big speech near the end, 'You had me at hello.'  A great moment in a great movie.",10,3,9,4 April 1999
A Bug's Life," Lots of fun for a family film
","I have to admit right off the top, I'm not a big fan of 'family' films these days.  Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental crap.  But this one, like TOY STORY, the previous film from Pixar, is a lot of fun.  The two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in ANTZ, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it.  The animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(I especially liked Hopper's line 'If I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you!'), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(Denis Leary doing an animated movie; what a concept).  And like everyone else, I loved the outtakes!  I hope the video has the new ones.",9,0,0,2 February 1999
The Insider," Stinging indictment
","Before I start, I should declare my bias up front; I have never understood the appeal of smoking.  Granted, I didn't grow up during the time when it was made to look cool in the movies, but I don't think it looks glamorous or stylish or any of that.  I can understand how some people will drink too much in that many alcoholic beverages actually taste good(I hope no one sees this as an endorsement of alcoholism, because it isn't), but cigarettes don't even taste good; it's just smoke.  I've always liked this routine I once heard where a comedian talked about smokers and their attitudes:'Smoking doesn't affect me, I can still exercise,' they say.  Then you walk up a flight of stairs with them, and all of a sudden they turn into Darth Vader(heavy breathing).  Meanwhile, there's Yoda on the railing going, 'Stunt your growth, it will.'All that is to say I was predisposed to liking THE INSIDER before I even saw it, since it goes after the tobacco industry(anybody who thinks legalized drugs would improve things should consider how the tobacco industry has handled its own legalized drug).  But if that was all it did, it wouldn't be a complete movie.  Instead, THE INSIDER, and Michael Mann, also make this an indictment of the news industry, which is more concerned with industry than news, and a complex character study of two men.Admittedly, there are a few facts fudged here.  The most surprising thing is an omission; I'm not entirely clear on this, but wasn't one of the CBS executives related to someone at Brown & Williamson?  Also, while it's not true the movie gives credit to Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) for manipulating a Wall Street Journal story(he merely gives them the other side of the story they were about to print), it doesn't give the paper enough credit for its own investigation(as Bergman in the movie points out, the Journal is not exactly known for going after big corporations).Still, this is a powerful movie.  One thing, as I said before, which makes it powerful is how it also goes after CBS, and in particular CBS News, for caving in to the possibility of a lawsuit(not a lawsuit, just the possibility of one).  And while Mike Wallace has criticized the film(though he has retracted that somewhat), the fact of the matter is if he had made a stink about it, CBS might not have caved in so easily.  And yet the film doesn't portray him as a bad guy, just someone who doesn't know if he has the fight left in him.And as a character study, of course, it's riveting.  Some people think this film is a departure for Mann from his usual crime dramas.  But Mann has also made films about flawed heroes(MANHUNTER, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS), which Jeffrey Wigand certainly is, and like the characters in Mann's more famous films(THIEF, HEAT), Wigand is a man good at his job, but not good at expressing his feelings, and backed into a stand he didn't know he was going to have to take.  Russell Crowe has not always played characters with simmering intensity(think of PROOF, THE SUM OF US, or THE QUICK AND THE DEAD), but as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL showed, he's masterful at playing them, and shows it again here.  He walks like a man defeated at the beginning, when he's fired, and you can feel the longing he has just for things to be normal again.  But you can also see the intelligence and the man who refuses to be pushed around by anybody, whether it be the tobacco company or Bergman. Pacino is also quite good as Bergman, playing not a hero, but someone who also is pushed into a stand he didn't think he'd have to take.Oh yeah, and as usual for a Mann film, this looks incredible.  Just as ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN(which this is being compared to) director Alan J. Pakula and cameraman Gordon Willis was able to visualize the creepiness of Watergate, here Mann and his cameraman, Dante Spinotti, emphasize how there's no black and white here by showing the gray areas visually.  All in all, this is a great film.",10,21,43,8 November 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," Fine showcase for Ryder
","It's always tough in today's goal-obsessed society to be someone who isn't quite sure what they want, but woman and minorities especially have it tough, because they seem to be automatically assigned 'roles' for them(if you're a woman, even today, people still ask you when you're going to get married; if you're black and look big, people ask if you're an athlete).  In the 60's, author Susanna Kaysen was in a similar position; she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life, but knew she didn't quite fit into the norm.  Because of that, and because of some legitimate problems(she tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin), she went into a mental hospital and was tagged with having 'borderline personality disorder,' a catch-all phrase which meant whatever the doctors wanted it to mean.  From her experiences in the hospital, Kaysen wrote the book GIRL, INTERRUPTED(the title comes from a Vermeer painting), and now comes the movie version from James Mangold and Winona Ryder.Mangold's first two films, HEAVY and COPLAND, were both about main characters leading lives of quiet desperation; the pizza chef in HEAVY unable to express himself, and the partly sheriff in COPLAND who must learn to assume his responsibility with that position.  Susanna fits in with those two characters, and Mangold does just as good a job with her, except for some melodramatic scenes near the end.  There are some major themes going on here, like whether Susanna is really crazy, just spoiled, or conditioned to think something is wrong with her, the nature of what 'crazy' is in the 60's, and of course being a woman at the time, but Mangold avoids making big statements for the most part, instead concentrating on Susanna's growth into being a little more sure of herself.As has been said before, Ryder brings a lot to the table, not just being a talented actress, but life research, having spent time in a hospital due to exhaustion(this is why she pulled out of GODFATHER PART III as well).  And instead of going for obvious drama, she too just makes Susanna's recovery a gradual and detailed journey, except for those melodramatic scenes.  The first third, which seems to be influence by SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, flashes back and forth through time, as if showing Susanna feeling lost and fragmented.  The rest of the movie is more linear, but Ryder doesn't make it boring.Some people have dismissed this as a chick ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, which is the usual knee-jerk response whenever a mostly female cast tackles what is normally done with a mostly male cast.  In truth, they're very different movies, primarily because in CUCKOO, we're meant to see the hospital staff, represented by Nurse Ratched, as evil, trying to break down the patients rather than build them up.  Here, on the other hand, while we're meant to see the system's shortcomings(in addition to what I said before, the different meanings of 'promiscuous' when applied to men and women), the hospital staff is generally seen as trying to do the best they can.  The patients may make fun of the doctors(well-played by Jeffrey Tambor and Vanessa Redgrave) and occasionally challenge the nurses(head nurse Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance in a long time), but there's no real hatred here, except maybe from Lisa.Angelina Jolie certainly has a flashy role with Lisa, the resident sociopath, but makes her seem real, until the movie betrays her at the end. When she's pushing people's buttons, she's actually quite sly about it, which is a lot more multi-dimensional than some have made it out to be.  The rest of the cast playing patients is also good(it was a little heartbreaking seeing Elisabeth Moss playing a burn victim, especially when they show a picture of her as a young girl, where she looks like she did in IMAGINARY CRIMES).  But it's Ryder who is the main reason for seeing this fine movie.",9,93,116,17 January 2000
Men in Black," Nice, silly fun
","I had reservations about this, since I didn't like Will Smith's last alien movie, INDEPENDENCE DAY, but then I saw part of a rough cut and became interested.  Seeing it in theaters, I liked it, though with some reservations.  Vincent D'Onofrio is a good actor, but all the scenes with him when he became the alien felt like they were dragging down the movie, and the alien didn't look very good either.  And Linda Fiorentino was wasted on her role, except for the scene where Smith thinks she's coming on to him, and the last scene.Still, this was fun.  I liked all the satirical pieces and the New York jokes, and I liked the way Smith and Tommy Lee Jones worked together.  As he proved with the two ADDAMS FAMILY movies, Barry Sonnenfeld knows that wacky humor comes off best when it's played as completely normal (especially Jones' reaction when Smith tells him the suspect he chased said the world was coming to an end; 'Did he say when?').  Overall, I enjoyed it.",8,0,0,25 February 1999
There's Something About Mary," Some belly laughs do not a comedy make
","Maybe as I grow older, I may be less tolerant of really tasteless humor, but I don't think so.  After all, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, which also starred Ben Stiller, also has tasteless humor, but it also had a consistent tone and no gaps of unfunny scenes in it.  There are admittedly some huge laughs here (like everyone else, I laughed at the zipper and hair gel scenes, and the dog humor is as hilariously twisted as anything since Monty Python), but there are also some boring stretches.  Eventually, you get tired of Mary being so naive about everyone's intentions, and how she only seems to attract idiots.  Cameron Diaz is an appealing actress, but she's stuck here with a part that doesn't require much besides being the object of affection. Most of the men don't come off much better; Stiller, who showed range in ZERO EFFECT, goes back to his nerdish character, and he overplays it to the point of being tiresome.  The saving grace here is Matt Dillon, who's quite funny as a sleazy investigator, complete with mustache.  One of the nice things is how he's been able to show a surprising aptitude towards comedy this decade with this, SINGLES, and BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, among others.  For the most part, however, you can give this one a miss.",5,0,0,15 March 1999
Mission: Impossible," Slick but entertaining
","A couple of things to get out of the way before I start.  First of all, I was not familiar with the TV series, so I don't have a history to compare it with like I did with, say, THE AVENGERS.  This is not to say I avoided seeing it, it just was never in syndication where I happened to live, or if it was, I just never noticed it.  On vacation one time, I did happen to catch a few episodes, but nothing stuck with me, except, of course, the catchphrases like 'Good morning, Mr. Phelps,' 'Your mission, should you choose to accept it...' and 'This message will self-destruct in five seconds.'  So those who said the movie suffered when compared to the show may very well be right, I just don't know.As for those who complained it was too confusing; with all due respect, you need to get out more.  I knew who the bad guy was within the first half hour, and so all you have to do is wait for the rest of the people to figure it out.Okay, now that I got all that out of the way; having seen this again on TV recently, first time since I saw it in the theater, I can confirm once again this is slick but still entertaining.  The main problem, as one critic said up here, is that this is neither an actor's movie nor a director's movie, but a story movie, and the story doesn't allow a lot of room for either the actors or the director to move.  You've got some good names here, but the only one with a character to play is Vanessa Redgrave, and she plays it beautifully(though Ving Rhames has some moments).  Especially lost is Emmanuelle Beart, a great actress and the most beautiful actress in movies today, but she's all wrong for the part here.  And though Brian DePalma stages some good scenes(especially, of course, the scene where Tom Cruise breaks into the computer room), he seems a little hamstrung by the plot. Maybe John Woo will do more with the sequel, I don't know.  Still, it is entertaining enough.  At least it wasn't like THE UNTOUCHABLES, which one critic aptly described as a beautifully wrapped package with nothing inside.",8,1,2,27 April 1999
The Red Violin," Excellent film about the power of music
","Francois Girard does it again.  Like his last film, 32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD, this explores the power of music (and though the subject here is classical music, it applies to all music), in a non-conventional, yet compelling way.  The 'red violin' is not the overwrought symbol it might have become in lesser hands, but the expression of how moved we are by music in so many ways.  The way it's tied up to fate, passion, and, ultimately, life, is also well done without being pretentious.  It's appropriate that the violin is used, for it's one of the most basic of instruments.  The way Girard weaves in and out of flashbacks is also well done.  Finally, the performances are all good, particularly Jackson as the collector.  I even liked McKellar in his small role, for while he's a good writer, I'm not a fan of his acting.  All in all, superb.",10,0,0,7 February 1999
Shine," Good, not great, film
","Being a piano player myself, I was interested in this tale, even though I had no idea who David Helfgott was.  I found it a good movie, though not a great one; the whole thing about the Rachmaninoff piece having the power to drive people crazy was a bit pretentious, I thought.  Other than that, though, it was good, especially when Rush allowed us to see the quiet moments.  And I don't think we were encouraged to see him as 'special' just because he was somewhat crazy, as some have charged.  I also think Noah Taylor, as the teenage Helfgott, was the most overlooked performer in the cast; this and FLIRTING prove he's got a lot of potential.",Null,1,2,22 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","After three years of waiting, EYES WIDE SHUT has finally come out.  So now after all this time, the delays, the rumors, the teases, the sad death of its director, Stanley Kubrick, we finally get to answer the question, Does it live up to the hype?  For the first time this year, the answer to that question is a resounding yes.  This is, so far, the best film I've seen this year, and it deserves its place among other Kubrick masterpieces like DR. STRANGELOVE, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.Although I had been looking forward to this film, I must admit I was unsure about it at first.  After all, since CLOCKWORK, Kubrick's films(BARRY LYNDON, THE SHINING, and FULL METAL JACKET), while having some good parts, have all been somewhat flawed, particularly THE SHINING.  But my misgivings were quickly put to rest within the opening scenes, where we get a glimpse of both what's right on the surface(nine happy years of marriage, wealth, a healthy 7 year old daughter, both husband and wife with jobs) and the possibility of storms that lurk underneath(the practiced way they get ready for the party, hardly looking at each other), and I stayed enthralled throughout.Now I'd like to use this forum to deflect some of the criticisms I've read of the movie so far.  One, of course, is that this is not really New York City, but a soundstage in England.  I've lived in New York City and visited several times, and the surface details seem right, but more importantly, this is set in the 'rich' area of Manhattan, which has always been idealized in movies(particularly the Woody Allen ones), and thus it's appropriate in a dream-like movie to play to the fantasy of the city, rather than the reality.Secondly, we are given no hint that this is a dream Cruise's character may be walking in, since it looks so real(yes, that's inconsistent with the criticism up above, but to be fair, I've only seen a couple of reviews which make that mistake).  First of all, dreams rarely look like they were designed by Salvador Dali(at least, my dreams).  Secondly, if the whole nighttime sequence looked like a dream and nothing else, we would laugh when Cruise goes back to the various places he visited at night; how would he know to go back to them if they weren't real?  Finally, in the way the narrative unspools, it's played like a dream, complete with scene where he might be awakening(the scene with Domino(Vinessa Shaw), the prostitute, where his cell phone rings and Kidman is on the phone right before he can do any damage).Thirdly, that Kidman is only in the film for 40 minutes of its 2 hour, 40 minute running length.  Now granted, that is all of her screen time, but when Cruise enters his 'dream state', she is always in back of his mind, not just in the flashback scenes(when he imagines her having sex with the sailor she had fantasies about), but in the fact that all the other women he comes across are meant to make him think of Kidman.  And her performance is certainly strong enough(especially in her monologues) to linger in the mind.Fourth, that Cruise is completely flat here.  Again, at least in the dreams I've had and read about, often in dreams we react to events, not provoke them, and that's what his character does.  Secondly, Kubrick and Cruise play off of his image, to make him the object of desire of everyone he meets, and not just women(I like to think the scenes where he's harassed by a group of teenage thugs who think he's gay, and where hotel concierge Alan Cumming seems to be coming on to him, are Kubrick's way of joking about the rumors of Cruise being gay which have dogged him).  For all of that, I think he plays it exactly right.Finally, that the film is flat and not really sexy.  Once again, unless it's a nightmare, dreams aren't played at MTV speed.  Secondly, contrary to what we heard at first about the film, this isn't about sex.  Rather, this is about sexual obsession, so it's not supposed to be about sex the act.  It may seem like the film cheats a little by asking us to play off our expectations of Cruise and Kidman as a couple, so we just picture in our heads them having sex, rather than us seeing it, but isn't it good that some things are left to our imagination?  Besides, it's only on the surface that things look good, as I said before.Unfortunately, I have not had a chance to read DREAM STORY, the novella this is based on, and so have no answer to those who claim this is a poor adaptation(though what some have called stilted dialogue I think adds to the dreamlike quality, and I'm normally on the lookout for flat dialogue), and that may be true.  But this is an excellent film, a fitting epitaph for Kubrick, and proof once again that Cruise can act when he's teamed with a real director.",10,144,212,19 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," As T.C. said, this movie rocks!
","You all may know the story at how Tom Cruise saw this movie at a screening in London, and afterwards said, 'This movie rocks.'  Whatever you may think of Mr. Cruise, I happen to agree after watching this film.  Although I had trouble following the story at times, it was a lot of fun, and Ritchie managed to juggle all the characters around and keep me interested and compelled to watch.  I also didn't have any trouble understanding what the characters were saying, and I think those who blind themselves to films like this by saying, 'Oh, I can't understand them' lack patience.  I also liked all the actors, particularly, of course Lenny McLean and Vinnie Jones(one of my few complaints is I would have liked to see more of them in the film). And for a film which feels violent, there's surprisingly little actual violence, which is refreshing.  Overall, not a particularly deep film, but a lot of fun.",9,80,108,14 January 2000
Titanic," Captivating experience that will stand the test of time
","When I first saw this movie the day it opened, I was going in because I liked the cast, I like James Cameron's work, I was blown away by trailer, and I prefer not to judge a movie by its budget.  I am not a fanatic about the actual ship; my reaction has always been, 'It's a big ship, it sank.  So what?'  Back on opening day, though some rave reviews had already come out, some dissenting views had also come, and while interest was expected, no one knew the ultimate fate of the movie.  And at the theater I saw it in, the projector broke down three times in the first five minutes, and I think it's safe to say the audience I saw it with was ready to kill.  Then, finally, the movie went on interrupted.By the end, though we of course took the free passes the theater provided us to apologize for our inconvenience, we were transfixed by what we had seen on screen.  James Cameron is a director who tries here to make art out of pure entertainment, and he suceeds on a massive scale.  There were better movies in 1997(TITANIC was #8 on my top ten list that year; the first seven were, in order, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, THE ICE STORM, ULEE'S GOLD, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, and GROSSE POINTE BLANK), but this was the best pure entertainment of the year.  The physical achievement of the movie, of course, is not to be forgotten, particularly when the ship sinks, and the scene where Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose(Kate Winslet) are standing in the front of the boat (the 'I'm flying!' scene), which, when I saw it in the trailer, was what made me want to see the movie.  But the love story worked for me as well, as did the wrap-around story of the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) remembering when she was in 'the heart of the ocean.'  DiCaprio is a good actor, and he's good here, though a bit too modern for me, but it's Winslet who gives the movie its heart, playing passion to the hilt.But as the 70's were the 'Me' Decade, and the 80's were the 'Greed' Decade, the 90's can probably best be described as the 'Backlash' Decade.  As soon as a work or artist in popular culture (American anyway) becomes popular, it seems people have a felt need to line up and dump on it simply because a lot of other people like it, and they can't stand it.  This is not to say all popular culture is good.  Rather, it is to argue that just because a lot of people like something doesn't automatically make it bad.  This is not the movie of the year, the decade, or the century, but it's a great movie, and I wish people would get over themselves and not consider those of us who feel like I do cretins.  This will stand the test of time.",10,1,4,28 February 1999
Psycho," Set the standard
","1960.  Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from 'auteur' critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.  This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic.",10,4,7,15 March 1999
Scream 2," Hell freezes over; I liked a sequel
","One comment I read said that they didn't like sequels, but who does.  Well, SOMEBODY must like them, otherwise Hollywood wouldn't keep on churning the bloody things out!!!  With rare exceptions, I am not one of them, and so I was surprised to like this film, which I saw instead of THE RAINMAKER that night.  It's just as funny and surprising, and almost as scary, as the original.  Some have complained about who the killers were, and sure, logic wise, it's a bit creaky, but in the sense that this is an homage to horror films (slasher films in particular), it makes perfect sense.  The only problem I had is the problem I had with the first one, and indeed, most Wes Craven films except the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET; the climax is way too long.",8,0,0,27 February 1999
The Green Mile," Huge disappointment
","Like a lot of people, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Though I didn't think THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was the greatest movie ever made, I did like it a lot, I liked Stephen King's serialized novel, and I like the cast.  So how did this movie go wrong?  Well, 'wrong' is perhaps too strong a word, since there are good things about it.  All the performances are good, and there are moments of real power(***SPOILER ALERT*** Like when Sam Rockwell grabs Michael Duncan.  Having read the novel, I knew it was coming, but Frank Darabont sets it up so well it truly is a shock. ***END SPOILER ALERT***).  And maybe my opinion of the film is tempered by the fact the theater showing it had projector trouble about 2/3 of the way through.  But I don't think that's it.One of the reason King's stories, when he's on, are so good is his characters are just ordinary people.  He doesn't try to make them insufferably noble.  And while the supernatural is his territory, he makes sure he grounds it in reality.  But in this movie, that goes out the window. I know John Coffey is a symbol, but in the novel he was also a real human being, and here, he's just a symbol, which gets to be tiring after awhile. And while I know this is a fable, and not a realistic story, Darabont lays things on awfully thick, especially when Hanks finds out what really happened to those two girls.  If I remember correctly, in the novel, he finds that out on his own, which is part of what I meant about grounding it in reality.  And while I am not among those who think movies are too long(if you think about it, a lot of the really good movies this decade have been over two hours), this feels longer than its 3 hour plus running time.As I said, I didn't hate this movie, but considering the talent involved, it has to be counted as a disappointment.",7,0,0,14 December 1999

","As I write these, the IMDB poll has this listed as the top film of their top 250 films of all time.  I'm a little surprised by this, as you can imagine. On the one hand, it's always nice to see a list that's willing to throw a curve, instead of automatically putting CITIZEN KANE at the top, and this choice certainly qualifies.  And don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good film.  The relationship between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is well played out (and both actors are excellent), the story is well-adapted from the Stephen King novella, and Frank Darabont deserves credit for keeping it simple without making it simplistic.On the other hand, the greatest film of all time?  It didn't even make my top 10 for 1994 (they were, btw, PULP FICTION, QUIZ SHOW, HOOP DREAMS, THREE COLORS: RED, THE BOYS OF ST. VINCENT, THE LAST SEDUCTION, NOBODY'S FOOL, BURNT BY THE SUN, SIRENS, and ED WOOD).  It did indulge in a few cliches, like the caged bird kept by James Whitmore's character, and the 'sisters', that prevented it from being a 5-star movie(that's my highest rating). Nevertheless, it is a very good movie, 9/10, and I'm glad to see so many people have caught up to it after it didn't do so well during its theatrical release.",9,0,3,4 March 1999
Scream," Still worthy
","Like Quentin Tarantino before him, Kevin Williamson has become one of the most revered/reviled writers of our generation.  I don't revere him(I hated I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and while DAWSON'S CREEK started off good, it got mediocre, except for Katie Holmes(*sigh*)), but I don't revile him, as this movie was good.  You don't have to be a big fan of the horror genre to even appreciate it(though it does help, which I found out after watching HALLOWEEN and then watching this again).  It does share a problem that every Wes Craven movie has had since NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - an overlong climax - but it's funny and scary, it takes some well-deserved shots at both the horror genre and how our culture reacts to death, and it doesn't look down on its characters or its audience.  Still, I am looking forward to SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER(or is it HALLOWEEN?), as this does need a spoof around now.",8,17,35,14 September 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Unusual horror film
","I'm not an expert in the horror genre, but I do know the reputation it earned thanks to the 'slasher' films which were so prevalent in the 70's and 80's, which could be described by the 'M' word; misogynistic.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of those rare horror films(hell, one of those rare films) which features a strong heroine who's also believable.  And Jodie Foster is the perfect actress to play it, conveying all the strength, toughness, resourcefulness, and vulnerability of Clarice Starling.  And while 'Buffalo Bill' may kill women, none of the women portrayed in the film, from Brooke Smith as the one in the pit, to Diane Baker as her senator mother, and Kasi Lemmons as Clarice's partner, are seen as just victims (even Smith, once she gets over her initial terror, tries to fight back).  It's one of those rare things, a feminist horror film.Of course, Jonathan Demme and Ted Tally, working from the novel by Thomas Harris (the best thriller novel of the 80's) do remember this is a horror film as well, and give us THE most terrifying villain of the 90's.  No, not Buffalo Bill, though Ted Levine is effective in the role, but Dr. Hannibal'the Cannibal' Lecter, played to mesmerizing perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Hopkins said one of the ways he tried to create Lecter's effect was trying not to blink, and that certainly does the trick.  But he also uses his voice, his lack of body movement, and his face to create terror, and while he pretends to give away nothing, in fact, without meaning to, betrays feelings for Clarice (just look at the look of sadness he has before he tells Clarice Dr. Chilton has come for her before he can give her what she needs to catch Buffalo Bill).Yet while Demme is quite good at the horror, he avoids the mistake most serial killer works have made today, and that's being too clinical.  People get so wrapped up in the science that they forget about the human beings who are turned into these monsters, and who are killed by them.  He also avoids being overly lurid; most of the actual violence occurs off-screen, and in the one case (the jail cell) where it doesn't,  we don't have big close-ups of the victims, but mostly shots of Lecter, which is frightening enough.By the way, two misconceptions to clear up; first of all, this film does not glorify Lecter.  It merely recognizes that sometimes, when you have to fight evil, you have to confront it.  Secondly, when this film was released, there were complaints that it was a homophobic film.  Buffalo Bill is not gay, and it states clearly that he was rejected when he tried to have a hospital make him a transsexual, so his behavior, not his desire, is what is portrayed as abhorrent.",10,1,2,15 March 1999
Any Given Sunday," Not quite a touchdown, but at least Stone is back
","Oliver Stone is one of the most, if not THE most, passionate filmmakers working today.  He's also a talented filmmaker, which a lot of people seem to forget.  When both his talent and passion are at full strength, the results are impressive(SALVADOR, PLATOON, JFK, NIXON).  When the passion is still there, but the talent is tripped up by his passion and ambitions, he makes flawed movies which are still powerful(WALL STREET, TALK RADIO, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, HEAVEN AND EARTH).  But when he goes outside of his passions, for either experiments(NATURAL BORN KILLERS), or to make 'mainstream' movies(U-TURN), he misses wide.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS, to me, was a worse film, but U-TURN was, in a way, even more dispiriting, because the former you could at least excuse as an experiment gone wrong, whereas the latter screamed 'Cash-in!'  You felt after watching Stone was too tired to fight anymore.Well, as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY proves, Stone, like his on-screen alter-ego, Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino), may look tired, but he's still got fight left in him. Many have seen football as war, so it's appropriate Stone has long wanted to make a movie about football.  And as Spike Lee did with HE GOT GAME, Stone wants us to see not only the glory of the actual playing(as well as how tough it is to earn that glory), but also the corrupt forces which are pervading it today.  After all, we decry flashy players, and then complain about those who are too boring, we talk about tradition out of one side of our mouth and demand the game be updated out of the other side, we call white players who exhibit boorish behavior 'colorful' while calling black players who exhibit similar behavior 'punks'(and that's putting it mildly), we complain about players who are overpaid while thinking nothing of owners who spend lavishly on themselves and move teams around, we complain about football being too dominated by TV yet sit around like couch potatoes every Sunday and Monday night, we react with horror when players get hurt badly and get addicted to drugs, yet we yell at them to murder each other on the field and call those who don't chicken(to put it mildly), and so on.This is a wide canvas to cover, and yet Stone does a pretty good job of it. Especially good is how the relationship between D'Amato and his new quarterback Willie Beamon(Jamie Foxx) encompasses a lot of that canvas. There are two scenes in particular which stand out; one where D'Amato sits with Willie on the plane and tries to talk to him, but can't think of anything which doesn't sound patronizing from Willie's point of view(like music, where D'Amato thinks the fact he's mentioning black jazz musicians is supposed to mean something), and the scene at D'Amato's house, where Beamon talks of how, in the past, 'playing for the team' was code for 'Know your place, boy,' and have things really changed?  Willie has to learn that playing for the team really does mean, as quarterback, getting them to respect you so they'll play for you, and Tony has to learn that tradition can't be stodgy, that it has to accept change.Stone is less sure in other aspects.  Cameron Diaz does a good job as the team's owner, but her character is a little too one-dimensional at times. It would have been more interesting to have here not just talk in terms of money, but that the game, to her, really is more interesting the way Willie plays it(maybe I'm biased, but I'm a fan of more pass-oriented games).  And while I don't think Stone is as misogynist as he's been charged with in the past, certainly it's evident here.  It's one thing to say there are groupies in football, it's another thing to delight in showing them.  There are sympathetic woman here, particularly Ann-Margaret as Diaz's mother, who shows what being a football wife costs, and Lela Rochon as Willie's girlfriend, who is unwilling to have that happen to her(the scene at the party, where she feels both isolated from Willie and the other wives, is nicely drawn).  Finally, Stone can't resist the ROCKY-type cliches near the end.But though it's flawed, there's still a lot of power here.  Except for Lauren Holly, who I'm not a big fan of, the acting is all around excellent, particularly Foxx.  I was particularly impressed with how well the athletes did as actors, particularly Jim Brown(though he's an actor, so this isn't surprising) and Lawrence Taylor.  And, of course, all the football scenes are terrific and feel real.  It's always good when you see on screen what you can't see watching the game on TV, and Stone accomplishes that here. Call it not quite a touchdown, but a film which convinces us Stone still has fight left in him.",8,49,74,12 January 2000
Trainspotting," Enjoyable ride
","I don't think this is the greatest movie ever made, but I did enjoy it.  It doesn't really go anywhere, and the scenes involving what happens to the baby are a little slow, since the filmmakers seem uncomfortable that they're dealing with a subject they can't have fun with, so they don't quite know what to do.  Still, this is consistently surprising, offbeat, and yes, funny except for the baby parts, and they make the most with the low budget they have.  And this is very definitely not a 'pro-drug' movie; it just lets the viewer come to their own conclusions, rather than give you a 'Just Say No' message movie.  The actors are all good as well; I especially hope Kelly McDonald is able to move on to bigger things.",9,0,6,27 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Strange but ultimately rewarding
","First of all, I've read a few comments about the pace of this movie being too slow.  I sort of agree with that, but I think it's refreshing to have a movie which takes its time and builds things with subtlety(although here, as I said before, I think it took a little TOO much time).  And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say.  At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment.  Then came the famous twist ending, and I will tell you that I was quite surprised, and it's making me turn the movie over and over again in my mind. I probably will have to see this again. Overall, while I don't think it's the best of the year, it is a good film.",8,57,113,25 August 1999
The Truman Show," A terrific film got attention it deserved
","After the surprisingly strong showing by this film at the Golden Globes, I hope people will check it out again (or if they haven't seen it, see it). This got overlooked after SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which I also thought was terrific, but this is terrific too.  In addition to Jim Carrey(who I normally don't like) and Ed Harris (who I do like), who were both great, I also think Laura Linney deserves praise as the actress playing Truman's wife.  She was hysterical, especially during her product pitches.  Let's hope Oscar remembers this film as well as the Golden Globes did.",10,0,0,2 February 1999
The Matrix," Entertaining for a Joel Silver movie
","There are two names behind THE MATRIX, one which made me interested, and one which gave me pause.  The one that made me interested is the Wachowski brothers, who made the highly entertaining 1996 thriller BOUND.  The one which gave me pause is Joel Silver, whose movies seem to function primarily as a way to pound people into submission.  Happily, THE MATRIX represents the sensibilities of the former more than the latter.  The ideas it throws out in this film are similar to last year's DARK CITY, and this is more or less a high-octane version of that, but it's entertaining, and the philosophy doesn't get in the way of the story.  The only time it gets to be like a Joel Silver movie is at the climax, when it becomes overkill.  Still, this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year so far.",9,0,0,5 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Good if somewhat overhyped
","No, I am not a STAR WARS fanatic.  I have seen it a few times, we own it (the original, not the re-release version), and I even saw all three movies at once in New Jersey about 5 or 6 years ago.  And I'll certainly see THE PHANTOM MENACE when it comes out.  But I don't own the toys, I didn't see the re-release versions, and I don't think it's the greatest movie of all time (I can't say on sci-fi because I always seem to end up arguing about semantics, and I haven't seen that many anyway).The special effects are good for its time, but special effects alone don't make a movie.  This is a fairy tale, as many have pointed out, but it's rather a clinical-looking one.  Some of the characters are one-dimensional. Mark Hamill was a little too green as Luke.  And I can sympathize with Harrison Ford, who reportedly told Lucas, 'You can write this s---, but you can't say it,' as some of the dialogue is wooden.  Maybe I needed to grow up on old serials like Lucas did.Having said that, the story is generally compelling, Ford and Fisher are good, and there's nothing wrong with simple if it's done well, which this is.  For people who blame this for what it left in its wake, PSYCHO has inspired more rip-offs than this, and it was inevitable movies would become more product than art, this just happened to be the trigger for it.  Another one would have been in its place.",8,1,2,4 March 1999
The Thin Red Line," Tough but ultimately powerful film
","I read the James Jones novel this was based on about a year ago, and after seeing the movie, I intend to read it again to see how it compares.  I can understand how many people have walked out saying 'What the hell was that?'  For me, however, it was quite powerful. I've never seen a Terrence Malick film before, but I was overcome by a lot of the images here.  Not just the war ones either; the image I most remember from the film is the shot of Miranda Otto(as Ben Chaplin's wife) on a swing.  This is not a linear plot movie, which always drives people crazy. Rather, it's a mood piece, and a reflection on man's relation to nature (and how war violates that relationship).  This, of course, brings it to the land of 'nothingness of being' movies, which normally drives me crazy, but I found it worked here.The voice-overs were a little over-used, but other than that, I have no complaints, not even of the rather large cast.  James Caviezel did a good job carrying the movie, and everyone else was good as well.",10,0,1,7 February 1999
Jackie Brown," Tarantino proves he's for real. Deal with it.
","I read a positive review of this film which said it was the Elmore Leonard adaptation people were waiting for, but he wasn't sure if this was the Tarantino film people were waiting for.  Well, sure, if you were expecting PULP FICTION pt 2!  Given the way we Americans (although I live in Canada, I'm a U.S. citizen landed here) love to backlash, I know it's really popular to say Quentin Tarantino is a hack, and I believe the account given in the book KILLER INSTINCT which suggests he let success go to his head.  Still, there's no doubt the man has talent, and he shows it here.I do agree with those who feel it's too long, De Niro is wasted, and Samuel L. Jackson does go overboard on the n-word.  But it's funny and compelling to watch after the plot kicks in, with the same attention to character Leonard has.  I'm not as familiar with the work of Pam Grier and Robert Forster that Tarantino and those of similar tastes are, but I was blown away by their work here.  And who'd have thought a filmmaker as supposedly trapped in hipsville as Tarantino would present straight a romance between two middle-aged people, let alone an interracial one?  That alone makes it worth watching.  I also loved Bridget Fonda in the role of Melanie, an airhead.  Fonda does that type of role well, because she has no condescension in her.  I'm sure this film will get better with time, once the 'Tarantino is nothing' campaign loses steam.",9,0,1,23 February 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," We demand a SHRUBBERY!
","Though this is not my favorite Monty Python film(MEANING OF LIFE is), this certainly is quite funny and quotable.  Of course, it's not for everyone; in college, I remember watching it with a group of people, some being Python fans, some who had never seen it, but were immediately receptive to it, and some who just didn't get it.  Still, I think it's funny.  If you're watching it with someone who is not familiar with Python, try to avoid saying all the lines along with the film(though you can sing the Camelot song).",9,0,0,17 March 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of the trilogy
","I know you're probably tired of reading comments like this all the time, but it's true for me.  Admittedly, I'm kind of slanted towards this one, since this is one of my early childhood moviegoing memories, since my mom took my brothers and I to a really big theater in New Jersey to see it.  This film explores the central characters deeper without sacrificing thrills and excitement, and while it's a more obvious set-up for the next movie than the first one was, it's still got a good climax scene that allows you to take away something good.  Ford and Fisher are able to create something together too, and Mark Hamill comes off better than in either the first or third ones.  In the book I read on the STAR WARS movies, it said Lucas liked this least of all, but I think he's wrong.",9,0,0,15 March 1999
Gladiator," Entertaining epic
","I can't say I'm a real big fan of what is known as the 'sword and sandal' genre.  Admittedly, I haven't seen too many of these medieval epics, but I can only think of two I liked(not counting Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, which spoofed the genre); BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS.  The former, despite an annoying lead performance by Charlton Heston, had taste and craftsmanship, the latter, despite a somewhat one-note performance by Kirk Douglas, had irony and intelligence.  The others all seemed melodramatic.  But Ridley Scott's new film shows there's life in this genre yet.Admittedly, the film does suffer in comparison in one respect; Scott seems less comfortable with the talking scenes and the backroom politics, as it were, than, say, Stanley Kubrick was in SPARTACUS.  All the scenes with Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov were, in that film, equally as compelling as the battle scenes.  Whereas in Scott's film, while he's cast some good actors like Joaquim Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Derek Jacobi, and they respond with good performances(in particular, Phoenix, an underrated actor, and not the obvious choice as the bad guy), you can sense his need to get back to the action.Fortunately, the action is all well done; while it's clear Scott is trying to have it both ways(make entertaining spectacle which comments on the need for entertaining spectacle), he stages it so well we don't tend to worry about that.  Also, he's helped mightily by the casting of Russell Crowe in the lead role.  Crowe couldn't play a false note if he tried, and he brings a lot to a pretty standard action hero here.  As with THE INSIDER, he's playing another person who takes a stand he didn't think he had to, and he leads by example, rather than bluster.  Overall, while I'm not a big fan of the genre, this is a fine example of it.",8,1,4,8 May 2000
Contact," Despite crucial error, this is an involving story
","One crucial error the filmmakers made in adapting Carl Sagan's excellent book is how they watered down Palmer Joss (it also doesn't help that Matthew McConaughey isn't entirely convincing in the role).  The argument of science vs. religion, or whether the two were compatible or mutually exclusive, was crucial to the book, and Palmer Joss was not only a three-dimensional character, he also had a clear point of view.  In the movie, however, his religious beliefs are just a generalized mishmash, and the movie suffers because of it.Still, this movie is quite powerful.  Jodie Foster shows why she was perfect casting as Ellie Arroway, using not only her intelligence, but her innner strength and vulnerability to play the character, and they all fit.  If the religion suffers, the science is well done without being too technical, and the filmmakers capture the wonder of it all without entering 'gee-whiz' territory.  Many criticized the ending, but I think this is the one case that the relgion part wasn't dumbed down.",9,1,3,17 February 1999
The Wedding Singer," Sandler's best, but that doesn't say much
","From the start, I have to say I hate Adam Sandler (except for his decent supporting performance in AIRHEADS), but some friends of mine convinced me it was actually good, so I rented it.  If I were the type of person who stopped speaking to friends because of their taste in movies, this movie would rank there.  As a satire on the 80's, this is not bad (if the intent is to have those of us who lived through it say, 'That was us?!?', it suceeded), but the rest of it is bad.  Sandler's more restrained than usual, but he still gets obnoxious.  Barrymore seems to be condescending to her character, and most of the acting and writing is of the 'gee-whiz' school of drama.  The soundtrack is good, but the movie wasn't.",4,0,2,7 February 1999
High Fidelity," Cusack continues winning streak with this film
","I read the novel when it first came out because the title intrigued me, and I found it quite good.  When I heard John Cusack was adapting it and moving the action to Chicago(from London in the novel), I was a little worried, because I worry about changing things during adaptations for arbitrary reasons, but I needn't have worried; though I have a few quibbles, which we'll get to later, Cusack and Co. have done a fine job adapting the novel.First off, I've read one comment which claims it stereotypes 'music geeks.' The type of people Hornby, Cusack, his co-writers(D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, who also co-wrote GROSSE POINT BLANK, and Scott Rosenberg), and director Stephen Frears are portraying is a very particular type of 'music geek'; the type who is a snob about music.  Almost all of us, I would say, are aggressive about our likes and dislikes when it comes to music, but not many, I agree, compare liking Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel to 'agreeing with both the Israelis and the Palestinians.'  And probably not many of us would be so cut off from feelings that, when hearing about a person's death, would find no better way of expressing their sorrow than listing their top 5 songs about death.  Yet we do like these people as characters because we see even if they have some snotty attitudes, they do have a genuine love for their music, and they're in a low-paying job because they love what they do. And who among us hasn't turned to music when we've felt sad(or happy), like Rob does, or wished that Bruce Springsteen(and a pox on the person who, in their comments, implied he was passe.  Bruce will NEVER be passe) would talk to us directly like he talks to us through his music?  The novel and the movie captures all of that.Another strength, of course, is Cusack's performance.  Woody Allen once said that while American actors were very good at playing virile men of action, there weren't many who could play more 'normal,' regular people.  Cusack, on the other hand, has carved out a niche for himself playing regular guys.  He doesn't look like The Boy Next Door, and he's neither stereotypically sensitive or hip, but comes across as a guy who feels both at ease and yet still longs for something more.  At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren't sure if they want to, and yet he's made each of them different.  Rob's condition may be a little more conventional - he's not sure if he wants to settle down yet - but Cusack, while unafraid to show his unlikable qualities, makes us like Rob anyway.The rest of the cast is also quite good.  The well-known names only get short takes(Lisa Bonet, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they make the most of their time.  I've never seen Iben Hjejle before(I haven't seen MIFUNE), but she does well as the most grown-up person in the movie.  But the real stars, besides Cusack and the music, are Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob's co-workers.  Black especially reminds me of people I knew.As I said, I do have some quibbles.  There are a couple of incidents in the book which don't make it to the film which I would have liked to see(the Sid James Experience, and the lady who wanted to sell Rob a ton of valuable records for a ridiculously low price).  I'm getting tired of movies which use rain as an expression of sorrow, and this is an example of overuse.  And the character of Laura isn't developed as well in the movie as she was in the novel.  Nevertheless, this is well worth checking out.",8,87,103,5 April 2000
The Godfather," Like the perfect meal
","I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called 'Literature and Film.'  This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, 'I believe in America,' this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue ('I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse' 'Leave the gun, take the cannoli') - and leave you completely satisfied.  And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days.  Incredible as it may seem, Part II is even better.  But I'll say more about that in those comments.",10,1,4,4 March 1999
