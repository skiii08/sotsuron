Blade Runner 2049," Waste of time
","Its completely waste of time. I can't believe who gives so good rating to this movie. The movie is going too slow, while your expectations of a science fiction script make you wait for something else, something that will raise your pulse and keep you focused on the whole time. However, I will recommend it to people I don't like.",1,9,22,17 October 2017
