Catch Me If You Can," Leo is finally in a good role
","I must admit i was unsure of going to see a movie starring Leo, i mean, he did a good job on Growing Pains, but as a guy, I havent been impressed by his other roles.  This movie, however, showed me a mature actor who was capable of filling into a challenging role.  Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio could carry the film by themselves as they each contributed excellent performances, but i was also impressed by the supporting cast.  One of the best movies of the year, bar none.",9,1,2,27 January 2003
12 Angry Men," Brilliantly done...
","The big visual effects and action sequences of today's movies might impress your eyes, but this movie will stimulate your mind.  I was told the entire movie took place in one room, so I was skeptical to view it, but I was glad i gave it a chance.  Excellent dialog, innovative characters and will filmed tale cements this movie as one of the greatest of all-time.",9,0,1,27 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien would be proud
","I have been waiting since sixth grade for a movie to be made about these books, and i am not disappointed at all.  While i am upset that Tom Bombadil was yet again left out of the movie, but other than that, it was great. Visual effects and musical score were phenomenal.",9,0,0,27 January 2003
