Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best movie of the Millennium
","Wow! And I thought I was going to be disappointed. George Lucas really did it. Episode I is fantastic! I'm not entirely certain it's better than 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi', but it was better than Star Wars itself! Maybe it was the best of them all.There wasn't much action, wars or galactic crisis in this chapter. This movie focused on character buildup and scenarios.Ever since I've read the Bantam Spectra novels and saw the special edition of Return of the Jedi, that was exactly what I expected when I saw Coruscant (also known as Imperial City). The planet is awesome and the city is fantastic. The traffic never ends. The senate chamber was astonishing. So many seats to thousands of Senators from thousands of Republic allied worlds.Naboo was a great new addition to the Star Wars planet list. Great scenarios. The city and the palace were from another world. The underwater city was even better than the city we see in the movie 'The Abyss'. The underwater monsters were pretty scary.Darth Maul is even more incredible than Vader ever was. His lightsaber was the most incredible weapon I've ever seen in the Star Wars universe. The lightsaber battle was the most amazing yet!Anakin was incredible. Such a naive and innocent little boy. I can't believe what's coming in his future can be so dark. The critics had no right, NO RIGHT to concentrate their fire on Jake Lloyd. He did a great job portraying Anakin. Natalie Portman also did a great job doing Queen Amigdala. Liam Neeson was the best of them all and Ewan MacGregor did a great job portraying a young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The pod racing was incredible. I'm going to buy Episode I racer for the Nintendo 64 as soon as possible!Since the story was not entirely concentrated on The Phantom Menace, I believe most of the story will be thrown on the next two episodes. I have a feeling they'll be a hell of a lot better. Oh god! I can't wait THREE YEARS for the next one!Fantastic job George Lucas! You and Lucasfilm did something that will never die. Every new generation will see the Star Wars saga! Congratulations Lucasfilm! The Phantom Menace is the BEST!!!!!",Null,0,0,24 June 1999
Armageddon," The 'end of the world' movie...
","Much better than the overly dramatic Deep Impact.Jerry Bruckheimer and his crew (responsible for The Rock, Con Air and other excellent action movies) did their greatest job in this movie. As we approach the end of the millennium, more and more movies and programs about the end of the world show up. Liv Tyler is one of the best young actresses ever seen on the big screen. Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck did a good job on this movie. It has more FX shots than i've ever seen on any other movie this year, except maybe, Godzilla. The soundtrack is fantastic. The best song couldn't be any other than 'I don't wanna miss a thing', by Aerosmith. This is one of the best movies of 1998, rivalled only by The Prince of Egypt and A Bug's Life. People say that movies like this are nothing more than poor crap. I strongly disagreee. A movie like this is meant for entertaiment. It's about the end of the world and the people who are forced to risk their lives saving it. We also see a lot of emotion from the people who worked on this film, especially Liv Tyler.",9,1,1,4 February 1999
Scream 2," Surprising!
","This is not, definitely not a scary movie. However I found it to be even better than its predecessor, which also was not a scary, but an entertaining movie though. People say that sequels are never better than the original movie. I don't find that necessarily true. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are both better than Star Wars. Star Trek: First Contact is definitely better than Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Terminator 2: The Judgement Day is far better than Terminator 1. And this movie is well written. Kevin Williamson always does it right. I expected more murders than the last movie, but it was still very exciting and enjoyable. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are even better in this movie and I liked the murder scenes. I was even more surprised than the first movie when I found out who was the real killer. Excellent movie. Better than Scream.The movie also brings out an interesting situation we live these days. Entertainment programs,games and movies affecting our minds with inappropriate contents and turning us into psychopaths. I don't agree with that. If people become violent just like that, then such people are crazy from birth, not from a movie meant for entertaiment. If that was true, I'd be roaming the streets killing people for fun, rather than commenting on such a good movie.",Null,0,0,10 March 1999
