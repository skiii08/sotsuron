Minority Report," Slick, sinister, thought provoking
","Philip K Dick was one of the most thought provoking SF authors ever and films made from his stories have a good record, Bladerunner being an obvious example.This is a slick film with huge product placement (did they realise how sinister the future they were to be placed in was?) and great production values.However, it is also a great film with a twisted and enjoyable plotline about predestination and the nature of choice. Tom Cruise does a great job of mixing self doubt and some action sequences to show off his muscles. The special effects are great and in the background and you end the film wanting to watch it again. It's not Matrix, but its close.",7,0,0,22 August 2002
Men in Black II," Crap stale pastiche
","This is a sad tired pastiche of a great film performed in a wooden and cardboard fashion by actors who must have seen through the whole thing. The humour is flat, the wit is non existent and the only good thing are the little people who live in a luggage locker..",1,2,4,22 August 2002
Gladiator," Gratuitous, boring and overlong
","I like Roman stuff, I like action films, I like historical films.I didn't like this film. It started well with a battle both dramatic and accurate. It then started to drift with the appearance of the hammed up Commodus. We then enter fabtasyland for a short while while Maximus rides from Germany to Spain and is then captured by slavers in the middle of civilised Rome and taken to Morocco. mmm.Proximo is a great character played by Oliver Reed, but then we get to a series of difficult to appreciate gladiatorial combats that frankly had little entertainment value and were gratuitous.Not that they were't authentic, just that they had little cinematic value.The film then drags on for ages and eventually the almost Goth-punk Emperor fights Maximus in the arena and is killed. ho hum, I was begging for the film to end by now..Now why should this film, which is quite authentic, not implausible and both modern and Roman in morality, be disliked by me so much?I can only echo Ebert that the film is dark, dull, morbid and has no flair. I watched Spartacus on the TV last night, and that is a much better film.Watch that and see what you think.",7,0,0,29 August 2000
