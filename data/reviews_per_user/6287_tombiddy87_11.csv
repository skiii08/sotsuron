Iron Man 3," A disappointing end to a otherwise impressive trilogy
","It may not be the Iron Man were used to but new director Shane Black brings us a more personal story of the man behind the mask as we see a vulnerable Tony Starks trying to come with his own inner battles.When a terrorist, known as the Mandarin starts to hijack the airwaves to send messages, threatening America with a plan to send countless strikes to the country Tony takes action and gives a live broadcast to avenge all who the Mandarin has harmed and in the process is forced to go on the run after a attempt is made on his life. He starts to question who needs Iron Man more, the public or himself. Robert Downey Junior gives one of his best performances as the billionaire genius as this latest instalment we a much more vulnerable character, very different to the cocky playboy we have come to know and it does show his talent as he does spend much more time out of the iron suit. The love of Tony's life, Pepper Potts played by Gwyneth Paltrow shows how far she has come since the first film and plays a big role in the first act. The Mandarin who is also Iron Man's arch nemesis is not a particularly accurate adaption from the comics and certainly falls short of expectations. Iron Man 3 does have it moments with some pretty impressive effects but there are great lengths when very little happens and the narrative suffers in the process. It's still worth a watch but don't expect a repeat of what we were given in the opening film of this trilogy.",5,1,5,11 September 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Dead awakening is a hit
","Remakes are becoming a bit of trend these days but very few manage to live up to the original. This is one of those few exceptions as Zack Snyder manages to stay faithful to the original while putting a few of his own ideas into the mix. When Fort Pastor, Milwaukee is hit with a vast spreading virus the majority of the population are converted into zombies. A group of survivors are forced to take refuge in a shopping mall. The film is let down by providing us with too many characters but some merely make up the numbers and don't get much screen time. A stand out performance comes from Ving Rhames who plays Kenneth, a cop mad with authority but has a good heart and Sarah Polley who plays Ana, a nurse whose a tough women under the circumstances. Snyder makes you really care about these characters, including a dog called chips. Just to up the game a bit Snyder's zombies can run. It makes you wonder how this move might affect the way zombies are portrayed in the future. There is much gore but it is not used to often and relies on the story as much as the action. The suspense is just as thrilling as some of the attacks. Snyder's Dawn of he Dead can sit along side the original without shame and has the potential to be the start of a franchise.",8,0,0,26 August 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Abbram's puts on a show in his latest feature
","Abbram's new vision of the long running Sci-Fi franchise may not please the most hardcore fans but never the less 'Star Trek Into Darkness' brings plenty of entertainment and thrilling action. The Starship Enterprise must capture a terrorist after he strikes a blow on Section 31 on Earth. They find out he is located on the planet Kronos but must take great caution to avoid starting a war with the Klingons. Kirk and Spock's friendship is strained as Spock is trying to balance his out right honesty in his duties and his loyalty towards the captain. Benedict Cumberbatch, best known for his leading role in successful BBC series 'Sherlock' steals the show with a outstanding performance as Harrison. Once more Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) played great off each other, providing the comedy while giving true portrayals of their character. Alice Eve is brought in to play scientist, Dr Carole Wallace. It seems like a clear attempt to bring in a female hero but for the most part is one dimensional. The films predecessor was clearly used to set up the character but little is done to progress those characters but to Abbram's credit the rare occasions when we see developments they are done very well. Despite these flaws 'Into Darkness' is still a fantastic addition and a fun action packed film. It brings potential and promise to the third installment set for a 2016 release.",8,1,2,4 September 2013
About Time," A story of love and family
","Richard Curtis's 'About Time' which the Director has claimed will be his last film is a heart warming experience. Curtis brought us Notting Hill and Love Actually and many similarities can be found in his latest project.21 year old Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is shocked when his Father (Bill Nighy) tells him all the men in his family can travel through time but only with in their own life. He need only find a small dark space, concentrate on the time he wishes to travels to. What seems at first to be a priceless gift becomes more complex as time goes on.The Father and Son relationship between Gleeson and Nighy is heart warming and superbly executed. Tom Hollander plays Harry, a old acquaintance of Tim's Father and play writer who reluctantly gives Tim a room in his house while he's living in London after moving from his family home in Cornwall . Lydia Wilson plays Tim's Sister, Kit Kat who has a close bond with her Brother. Rachael Mc Adams plays Mary, Tim's girlfriend who he meets in the Dans Le Noir, a restaurant where people eat in the dark. Lindsay Duncan who plays Tim's Mother is talent wasted and is constantly a spare part. 'About Time' provides charming humour and like Curtis's previous works is a film about love and family but also the relationship of a Father and Son which will send everyone who watches it on a emotional roller coaster of what we all call life.",9,2,4,16 September 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel starts to soar and comes crashing down
","Zak Snyder shows us once again a impressive firework show of specials effects but lacks to keep a compelling story as Man of Steel falls flat. When the planet Krypton is dying scientist Jor-El(Russel Crowe) and his wife launch their new born son Kal-El in a escape capsule to Earth. He is taken in by Jonathan(Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent(Diane Lane) and is named Clark. For the time being he is safe but sooner or later he must confront his past. This latest addition had such promise with Christopher Nolan(Director of the Dark Knight Trilogy) involved but for what ever reason his involvement could not save Man of Steel from being one of the biggest lets down this year. A fairly unknown Henry Cavrill who formerly was the leading role in 'The Tudors' TV series, does a decent enough job at playing Superman/Clark but is easily forgettable and Amy Adams who plays his love interest Lois Lane never quite gets her character right and is too accepting when she discovers Kal-El/Clark's secret. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane defiantly give the best performances.The origin story was set up well but once the action started it did not cease and ended being a overkill.This latest take on Superman brings the people of Smallville not a hero to protect them but rather death and destruction. It's a surprise there were anymore buildings standing by the end of the 143 minutes. Will Snyder continue down this destructive road or will we see more nobility in the next installment?",6,0,3,20 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Released too soon after Sam Raimi's trilogy
","This film is not a ultimate success but it also is not a fail either. That being said it has to be looked at from many angles to get a full understanding of why it failed to match the box office success of Raimi's trilogy.Background Story- When you start any movie franchise off the most important thing is getting a solid background story for the character. The main focus is the mystery of what happened to Peter's parents. We saw flashbacks through out the movie of Peter's memories of his parents. The problem is we get too engrossed in these flashbacks which results in a slow pace when the main focus should be about how Peter becomes Spiderman and it feels too often like his alter ego (Spiderman) is a side story rather then the main focus point.Characteristics- Now in Raimi's adaption Peter Parker was one of the least popular kids in the school and a bit accident prone, which is the perfect character because once he is Spiderman it shows how far he has come. However in this adaption Peter is a bit cocky and not nerdy at all. It's almost like he is too polished.Villain- Now this is one of the most important aspects of a super hero movie. If you don't get your villain right not much else will go right. Now Raimi got it spot on. He brought in Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin. A great start to the trilogy and makes the audience want to come back for more which is good for when the sequel comes out. There are the villain in Amazing Spider-Man. The main reason is he is a giant lizard. How more accurately it is the transformation of a scientist who is played by Rhys Ifans who's experiment went wrong so I'm afraid it's another point to Raimi's trilogy. Love interest- This however is one angle where Amazing Spiderman gets it right. Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) it a much better match for Peter. They both have a fascination for science and are more alike. The other love interest that we are comparing it to is of course Mary Jane who features in Raimi's trilogy. It is obvious in the story that Peter sees Mary Jane and thinks she is out of his league. So although I credit director Marc Webb for taking the reigns of a reboot so soon after the previous set of films and taking into account the success it brought in the box office, it just didn't feel like it ever got going. Although there is room for improvement Webb has the ability to level out the bumps in a other wise decent start to the reboot.",7,0,2,1 December 2012
Remember the Titans," A movie to unite all
","A film which retells the true story of how a group of High School football players put asides their prejudices to become a winning team and help narrow the gap in a racially devided community. In 1971 Denzel Washington plays Herman Boone, a coach who has been appointed to lead T.C Williams High School football team. He replaces Bill Yoast played by Will Patton. Boone allows Yoast to stay on his coaching staff. Black and White players frequently clash through racial motives but Boone is determined unite his team. The plot might not be original but there are some fine acting. Denzel Washington is superb from start to finish and there are some great one to one scenes between him and Bill Patton. Ryan Hurst who plays Gerry Bertier, a key player is given some tough and emotional scenes and he executes them with precision. This film sends a message on how it is important to do the right thing regardless of who you might offend. Disney are one of the last studios you might of imaged to deliver a story with such deep layers and they have done it with such class.",6,0,0,25 August 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Reach my expectations and more
",Wreck It Ralph is one of the best animated films Disney have produced in a while which was a nice change since Pixar have not released a on par movie for a while. With some great voice acting. It was like Toy Story at times as I felt it shared some of the same ideas.Ralph is fed up of being the bad guy in his video game. The only way he can gain respect from the other characters in his game is by winning a medal so he jumps to other video games in search for one. The different video games we see are very well designed. There are quite a lot of jokes that only video game fans will get but it's still a great watch for all. It was a surprise how many licensed characters were used which was a great plus. It was entertaining through out and was made into a proper story for it would of been easy to make it into a gimmick. They got a balanced of keeping it both relevant to kids and also enjoyable for adults. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman's voicing of Ralph and Vanellope were excellent.It will be very hard for anyone studio who has a similar idea to match this. Even if it is a success in the box office it will be hard to reinvent this idea for a sequel.,8,1,2,9 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A great conclusion to the detective's tale
",Once more and for the final time Christopher Nolan manages to pull it off as we can add another well told story in the Dark Knight Rises.Bruce Wayne(Christian Bale) has left the vigilantly which is Batman behind him and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile a new criminal is arising called Bane (Tom Hardy) who's plot will threaten he safety of Gotham. Batman will be forced to come out of hiding and will need the help of a cat burglar but things become more complicated when there is another plotter behind the evil plan. The pacing is slightly off for the first 45 minutes and a couple of plot holes crept in but it did not effect the story overall. Tom Hardy steals the show and the fact that you can barely see his face did not knock the effectiveness of his chilling presence when ever in a scene which just boasts his ability as a actor. It would be a crime to forget Anne Hathaway who provided the key role as Selina Kyle.With some great camera work and fairly decent fight routines between Bale and Hardy the final installment is a overwhelming success.,9,11,17,30 November 2012
Monsters University," Mike and Sulley are back as Freshmen
","The last few attempts by Disney may not be up to the standards that we expect from Pixar films with the likes of Brave and Cars 2 but Monsters University is a step in the right direction even if it doesn't quite match the 2001 feature Monsters Inc.It takes place many years before Monsters Inc, Mike Wazowski is attending Monsters University determined to work hard so he can fulfill his dream of being a top scarer. Unfortunately he is rubbed up the wrong way by fellow freshman James P 'Sulley' Sullivan who feels he does not require to put in the work to achieve his goal but they must pull together if their to win 'the scare games'There is some great voice acting from a bunch of misfits who end up house sharing with. They include Don (Joel Murray), a former salesman, The headed bickering twins Terry and Terri (Sean P.Hayes and David Foley) and the doughy looking Scott(Peter Sohn). Monsters University might not provide us with any of those emotional scenes that we have come to expect from Pixar but it does provide laughs for young and old alike.",7,0,0,24 August 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A great end to a great saga
","Deathly Hallows Part 2 is well directed and every actor gets their moment to shine which is impressive considering a run time of just over two hours. The battle between good and evil comes to it's climax. Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their search for Voldemort's Horcruxes (objects with part of his soul concealed inside) and their search brings them back to Hogwarts but when Voldemort finds out he deploys all his forces on the school in a attempt to stop them once and for all. Despite some rushed scenes early on David Yeates does the best he can to fit a lot of content into a film slightly over two hours. Matthew Lewis's performance as Neville Longbottom really showed the young wizards full abilities and how far he has come. Maggie Smith's performance as Professor McGonagall is once again fantastic. Let's not forget of course Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape whose character is a main focus for much of the film as it has been throughout the saga also. This finale marks a great end to a truly memorable set of films which many generations in the future will enjoy.",9,0,1,26 November 2012
