Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The film is a bit over hyped
","Well say we like it or not, the movie still hauled nearly a billion dollars in box-office ticket sales alone. But still everyones a critic (the same goes for me). You should definitely watch it if you have seen the first trilogy, otherwise see the them first cause they are much better and will give the interest of watching episode 1.To sum it all up here are the pro's and con's that I thought were:Pro's: F/X, Music, Darth Maul, Qui Gon, Obi-Wan, Watto, fight scenes, trailer, and the usual star wars stuff.Con's: Jake loyd's acting, too little Music and light saber scenes, story too predictable, becomes a bit monotonous in the middle (lets face it Lucas is directing a film after 20 years).I hope the second episode will have a different director as we can see George Lucas's strays and the story is a bit more exciting.",Null,0,1,11 January 2000
Fight Club," One of the Best Movies in History
","If American Beauty deserves an oscar than Fight Club deserves 10 oscars.....I would say this movie has been underrated by most people and not given the respect it deserves.... the acting, sound, story, directing, cinematagrophy are all A+ ....In the consumer society in which most of us live in .... this movie really re-define the meaning of life...its a real work of art and story telling , with comedy , action and sex....This movie trully deserves to be in theatre as one the best films ever .... And I rarely give a film 9/10 .....",10,0,1,12 July 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Good but not that good...
","Pros: Great action, not overally complicated storyline, Thandie Newton and other overall cast, location of movie, the facelifting, cinematography and sound...Cons: Action scenes are at the too prolonged and very unrealistic, story is quite predictable at times, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise's character) is lost with identity crisis with James Bond and Jackie Chan.I personally liked the complex storyline presented in the prequel of Mission Impossible...it made me see the movie several times to understand it completely but I enjoyed...only someone like Brian De Palma could pull it off this ultimate story of deceive.Sure John Woo is the king of action but at the end 20 minutes of the film it becomes all pointless ... you know when there will be a macho fist to fist fight with the big bad guy, and hero wins, the villain fakes his death and rises up but the  hero is still a wiseass...and rescues the beautiful girl from the clutches of evil.Tom Cruise tries more to like the flamboyant James Bond rather the spying mole he played in MI-1. There were elements in the original series and first movie that I especially liked. These vital essence are missing in this movie.Otherwise the movie is quite ok, nice way to have fun and spend two hours time. John Woo fan will surely like it, but me being more interested the deciet, espionage and investigation prefer MI-1...compared to MI-2...At the end I give it 73 out of 100....the same score I gave 'The World is Not Enough'..",7,0,0,18 June 2000
