The Monuments Men," The Undeveloped Men
","At first sight, everything seems to be going for this film: the concept, the cast, the director, the writers -- even the trailer makes it seem worthwhile. So what went wrong? The writing went wrong. The film does a good job of showing that no matter how great other aspects may be, without good writing you have nothing. With perhaps the exception of Clooney's character, there is little development for many of the other characters. This becomes apparent when certain scenes arise requiring an emotional response, but since we're yet to really get to know them, we feel nothing. If you are wanting to see this film based upon being a fan of one of the featured actors, then you will be disappointed. Bill Murray and John Goodman in particular seem very underused and an overall missed opportunity. There is also very little humour, considering its concept and cast (I understand it's set in Nazi Germany, but that's no excuse).Save the cost of an expensive theater ticket and wait for the rental.",5,1,2,18 February 2014
