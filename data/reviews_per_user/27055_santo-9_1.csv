Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Never thought of an 'A new hope' remake
","Episode I was the movie I been waiting my whole life and when I saw it I was very dissapointed, I thought 'I have seen this before', for days that thought spinned in my mind and then I realized: Episode I is the remake of the very first Star wars film ever made. Think about it, the characters, situations and dramatic turnovers are the same in both movies. Just look at this list: -A non-adult innocent boy, with a lot of force inside of him. I either pick Luke or Anakin. -A royal woman with an attitude. I pick Leia instead of Amidala because the first is much smarter. -A man who follows his own decisions, no matter who is against them. I prefer Han Solo rather than Qui Gon Jinn (Han can use a lightsaber, Qui can't use a blaster). -A sidekick who only mumbles a few sounds and is an excelent machine repairer. Chewbacca is a lot cuter than young Obi-Wan. If you think a little you can find more similarities , and maybe we can make a 'why is better IV than I' list. Don't get me wrong, I love star wars , but I expected Episode I to be superior to A new hope, but when I saw it i remembered that Star Wars: A new Hope is the best movie ever made and no other film is gonna take off that title, not even one of the prequels.",Null,0,1,5 August 1999
