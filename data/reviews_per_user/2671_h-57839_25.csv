The King's Speech," Love the movie
","In fact, no one is perfect, no matter how good people are, they also have shortcomings and imperfections that they can't think of to mention, but they always hide these, the people only see the bright and perfect side. In the middle of the night more thinking and crying, the dawn of the morning to stay up to study hard, painful comparison and psychological pressure... Perhaps can only hold back, understand, reply to the world is only a smile, just a back view.

World War Z," Great
","The charm of Star Wars is that people have magnificent expectations and infinite desire for another life in another world. It's a force beyond the real world. If there really is a force, it should be a reflection on 'another life.' This kind of thinking forever torments, prodds and comforts mankind, leading to the kinds of actions from thought to practice that shape each other.

The Revenant," Love leo
","The film first gives people a strong visual impact is very characteristic photography style, scheduling perfect long lens, wide Angle rotation lens, large panoramic, natural light shooting and so on.

Frozen," love it
","Best Disney animation in years. Although there are a lot of movies, but has a very unique perspective, focusing on sisterhood, rather than the traditional prince and princess happily together. The character description is profound, everyone has a multi-dimensional character, the introduction of two female protagonists is unprecedented. Music is definitely broadway-level, and a whole part of storytelling, not just for the sake of singing. Wonderful!",9,1,2,8 April 2020

","Favorite spielberg's place is in the character he doesn't look tall, whole is absolutely beautiful, but in the real documentary, therefore the present are a real person, Mr Schindler's speculative psychology, as a merchant's treachery, the first for the numbness of the jews, can easily know the start of the film, but this does not affect his greatness. Unlike many biography movie always like in the acura praise at the same time, the great man's flaws were erased, not absolutely perfect don't give up, but a good student must have got a perfect score in always is a dull student, a small evil thoughts never initiation any person also must be a boring person.",9,0,1,24 April 2020
I Am Legend," Love the movie
","Will Smith plays a wonderful role in the film, showing his love for little Sam, his beloved pet, and his grief at having to end his life himself. A few scenes of forced laughter, you can even see through his brow that 'unique' sadness. In other words, as a commercial film, the ideas, acting, action are just right, what more do you ask for? You know, there's a lot more to movies than killing zombies.",8,2,2,30 March 2020
1917," Can be better
","The lack of insight into the characters' dilemmas and the dangers of this extremely difficult, near-suicidal mission makes it seem as if the film is piecing together pieces.",8,0,4,4 April 2020
La La Land," Great songs
","The aesthetic feeling is too beautiful too beautiful, the aesthetic feeling of the artwork, basically reached the film language sound painting audiovisual output information acme. If anything, it's the kind of thing that doesn't blink or end, sits in a chair hoping it gets as long as possible, and then silently plans when the subtitles come out to watch it again.",8,1,1,1 May 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Crying for the movie

Pulp Fiction," unique
","A masterpiece of nonlinear narrative cinema. Clever structure and deep meaning, wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has a good quality, but they are hopelessly dark and confused. Each paragraph has a complementary structure, with the beginning and the end linked together, suggesting that in reality, similar to the plot in the movie, it is always happening and never stops.",8,0,0,7 May 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The. Best chapter

Joker," Joker

Inception," Love leo
","Inception is not just about dreams. Dreaming is only a form of the film, it is more about some ideas. For example, a person's subconscious mind is characterized by self-preservation. In real life, there are a lot of people will not wish to accept some facts, they will go their own way, to the other people blocking their way to avoid or remove the way. These actions are the embodiment of this thought.",10,0,1,8 May 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Love the movie
","In terms of narrative performance, the film sublimates the theme of 'freedom'. The so-called freedom is also hope. There are many things in the movie that symbolize the oppression of freedom, and Andy mentioned 'hope' to Red more than once. Although Andy was physically and psychologically imprisoned from this prison, he did not give up his pursuit and desire for freedom and hope. Andy: that's right. Andy: that's right. Through these, the film has been telling us the true value and meaning of 'hope' and 'freedom'.",9,0,2,27 March 2020
Parasite," Just so so
","'Parasites' is not about a class or a group of problems, not about the parasitic relationship between poverty and wealth, but that everyone can have problems.In fact, the shortcomings of human nature is an inherent phenomenon left over, the human gene is from the competition for resources and competitive selection, is engraved in the blood of the bad history and relics, even if one day to achieve unlimited energy technology people no longer worry about livelihood, this feature is difficult to eliminate in a short time.But modern people are people because of the ability and rules of self-restraint, and if there were a criterion for distinguishing between the top and the bottom, it would probably be the capacity for reason, intelligence and empathy.",7,0,2,12 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The great fairytale movie
","As a mythological story, the Lord of the rings inherits the simple ideological theme and narrative structure of ancient mythology: the hero defeats the devil and the good triumphs over the evil.

The writer and director also strictly followed the original theme, with a slightly lengthy but remarkable ending, giving the epic a stronger literary flavor.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
Green Book," Really like the movie and actor
","At the end of the story, don shows up at Tony's house with a gift. The family is surprised and welcomes don.
