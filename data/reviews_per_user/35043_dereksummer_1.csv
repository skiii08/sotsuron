The Rock," From my favorite action director, Michael Bay, comes my favorite action movie.
","From my favorite action director, Michael Bay, comes my favorite action movie.  Ed Harris, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Michael Biehn make up this movie's excellent cast and all give great performances.  Not only does this movie have top-notch acting and directing, but the musical score rocks. I loved the music during the Cage/Connery chase scene.  The SEAL slaughter scene also had great music.  I thought the plot was a little far-fetched, however.  Don't get me wrong, it was a -good- plot.. just not very believable.  I high recommend this movie not only to action fans, but just about any movie fan out there.",10,1,1,22 March 2000
