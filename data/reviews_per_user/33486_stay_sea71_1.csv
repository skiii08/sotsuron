50 First Dates," Loved this Movie
","I would like to start off by saying that I hate Adam Sandler movies. But I have to compromise if I expect him to see a chick flick with me. My husband loves SNL people movies and I find them stupid. I like movies with substance and that make you think. He hates them. I was forced to see this movie and I loved it. It was sweet without being to corny, I could have done without the other SNL guy (Rob Snider). I love romantic movies like this that don't seem to be like other movies. It is a great movie that my husband and I both enjoy. It is our movie the perfect combo of what we both like, and it is refreshing. It is on my top ten list for favorite movies.",10,0,1,10 January 2005
