The King's Speech," Historically very dodgy but an acting tour de force in the lead role
","All three lead players (Helena Bonham Carter, Geoffrey Rush and, of course, Colin Firth) are first rate but it is really Firth's film. His acting is just breath-taking and he really makes you feel for and with a figure from history with whom most people would probably not think they have much to share at all.The historical 'background', though, is very much a 'right on' adaptation / tailored for a British/US 2011 audience and full of errors which a history teacher would spot immediately, e.g. Churchill being 'at the centre of things' in the 1930s right up to the outbreak of war (or even for 'Bertie' and against 'David') - ridiculous; Baldwin feeling he had 'failed' (especially over foreign policy) whereas in fact he retired (rather than resigned) in a glow of popularity for having 'sorted out' the mess of the Abdication - nonsense; the prospect of his saying, in resigning, 'So Winston was right all along' - complete rubbish (as they had in fact been at daggers drawn since 1930) and, overall, it has to be said, the idea that the vast bulk of the UK populace (and especially many in high social and political circles (the true feelings of Bertie and Elizabeth towards Chamberlain are not shown in any real way either)) had any feeling that war with Nazi Germany was inevitable until well into 1938 (and, in fact, early 1939 for very many when, despite his assurances at Munich, Hitler (by now hell-bent on war (although not necessarily with Britain and France)) simply marched into Prague/the remainder of Czechoslovakia without any discussions whatsoever with London or Paris and, in doing so, convinced the vast majority of people that he was a lying scoundrel and someone who was determined to gain his (insane) ambitions no matter what it cost (to other countries and even the German people).",9,3,6,13 January 2011
Black Book," A so-so film, but massively over-rated by some commentators
","Good production values and a smashing central performance, but this film otherwise has very little indeed going for it, with its convoluted, (but also entirely predictable), plot, gratuitous violence and scenes of nudity and by over-staying its welcome by at least forty minutes. Obviously, its Dutch makers felt a real need to make a film about life under Nazi occupation, the Dutch resistance, the treatment of the Jews and the relationships of various protagonists from all of these domains, but, given the resources evidently at their disposal, one could have hoped for much more of an achievement than this concoction of a film. It seems that no-one could come up with a really convincing or satisfactory script/plot/vision to unite the various aspects of the stories they wanted to tell and so what one gets is a series of 'adventures' loosely linked together, but in such a manner as entirely to fail to illuminate, entertain or even, towards the end, hold one's interest much overall. Something to view once, but unlikely to remain in the memory for any length of time after having been seen, (beyond the really great performance by Carice van Houten and the interesting support of Sebastian Koch - both stuck in a film hardly worthy of their talents).",7,2,4,23 November 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," My vote goes with the 'thumbs down' reviewers
","A complete load of old tosh. The lack of any real plot, (with something between 'Theology for Beginners' and simple New Age gibberish competing to try to form this), leads to over-compensation in the special effects field. The latter are used again, and again, and again, and... to portray endless 'battles' between the (human) Goodies and the (Machine) baddies and fights between the three main protagonists and 'Smith', (who comes to represent...oh, that's right, because the plot is so poor, you never really understand what!). Of course, because these battles and fights are so similar and so protracted, they become, like the film as a whole, unbelievably b-o-r-i-n-g and by about half way into the film you really could not care less who wins 'the War', you just want the thing to end and to justify your video rental money by enduring this torture until the closing credits. What also contributes to this, of course, is the fact that the characters are just human computer game figures by this stage, lacking in humour or any real discernible human emotion to such an extent that, when Neo and Trinity do show their 'love' to each other, it comes across as a scheduled 'emotion check' between the battle/fight scenes and just as authentic as a fifteen dollar note. No, this, (together with the other sequel predecessor, (which was bad, but not to the same degree as this turkey)), should stand as the all-time warning to any director/writer responsible for producing a truly brilliant film, (which the original 'Matrix' certainly was), and who is thinking of producing a/future sequel/s by calling up inside them a little voice, saying, 'Are you REALLY sure?'",4,6,11,5 May 2008
The Duchess," Great hats and hairstyles!
","Superb job by the costume designers, hairstylists and location spotters. Nice to see Charlotte Rampling in a big production again as well. What of the two leads, Fiennes and Knightley? They really try and some of the scenes are quite moving, but, overall, a second rate script defeats them, which, basically, does not have enough 'meat' to cover the entire length of the movie (meaning that we get lots of scenes inserted on the same principle as 'The Tudors' TV series - 'ten minutes up, undergarments down' and time for a bit of carnal viewing for the audience). Overall, I came away feeling the script writer/director had tried to be just a little too clever in getting the 'parallels' across: a beautiful, young member of the minor aristocracy is 'auctioned off' by her parents to marry a (much older) member of the 'top of society' (have you got it yet?) Her family name is 'Spencer' (have you got it now?) The old fogey she marries only wants her to produce a male heir (come on!) and it becomes apparent he has no interest in her at all as a person. In the end, he forms a relationship with another woman (who has lots of strapping, healthy sons) and they form a 'menage a trois' under the same roof (Ahh, now you've got it!!!!!!) In the end, she fights against love and following her heart (and going for cruises on big yachts in the Mediterranean?) and instead sacrifices herself for the sake of her beloved children. MORALE: women in the 18th century had it rotten and is it not lovely to live in an enlightened, blissful era like ourselves instead??! As I said, I would concentrate on the hats (how DID they keep those things on top the massive haystacks of hair piled up on their skulls???)",Null,3,4,26 August 2011
From Hell," A silly film with very little appeal beyond three good performances by supporting actors.
","Where to start? To begin with, the plot has already been filmed in an adequate (and vastly more entertaining) manner in the 1979 film with Christopher Plummer and James Mason 'Murder by decree'. Secondly, Johnny Depp's 'English' accent must be well up there for the Dick Van Dyke 'cod-English, 'gor, blimey, govn'r'' Award - it is so abysmal that you LONG for another of the 'opium den'/'vision' scenes because one knows that at least he will keep his mouth shut and spare one's ears. The 'opium den' scenes themselves, and the role they 'play' in the script, are also themselves the height of silliness, even if they play the 'key' role in the final scenes and the 'saving' of Depp's sweet-heart. The whole role and everything about the latter ('Mary Kelly') is also virtually 'off the silliness scale'. As usual with films about Jack the Ripper, the producers want it both ways; revelling in the filth, poverty, gore, diseases and total cheapness of and disregard for human life prevalent in the slum areas of London in the 1880s, whilst, of course, portraying the lead, especially female, characters, as if they had actually nothing to do with such surroundings. The police photographs and crime scene sketches of the time, to which the film refers at many stages, show the real Mary Kelly (as with all of the other victims of the Ripper) for what they actually were - wasted, emaciated, disease-ridden and broken women, decades old before their time. The 'Mary Kelly' of this film, with her fresh complexion, beautiful 'Pre-Raphaelite' auburn hair, spotless clothes and bright, assertive expression is a travesty of the reality. If, however, 'Kelly's' general appearance and demeanour are shams, wait until the final scene when she escapes to a 'designer' cottage directly on the coast of Ireland with her 'rescued daughter' and decides to devote her life to bringing up the latter in healthy,clean and invigorating surroundings rather than the rat-infested slums of the East End of London - I say, what a terrific idea! A VERY silly ending to an extremely silly film which deserves to be totally forgotten and left to the type of murk and dark obscurity in which most of it is shot and which even makes the physical act of simply watching almost as disagreeable as waiting for the 'plot' to unfold. The ONLY saving graces were the performances of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson (the latter's appearances, though, being far too brief).",5,4,7,28 February 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," An interminable BORE once the initial scenes with Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffths are over!
","Probably the greatest waste of talent and money since the Burton/Taylor 'Cleopatra' of the 1960s. After the initial scenes with Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths, the thing is just one interminable stretch of ennui, inter-spersed with special effects which are initially quite good but which, fatally, do nothing to bring the pasty-faced and innocuous 'lead' character child actors to life, about whose fates and undertakings one becomes progressively LESS interested as the whole things drags itself from one phony set scene to the next until, after two and a half hours, (which seems like months!), the whole thing fades out like a candle finally guttering in its holder. Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane etc. etc. must have sent their agents a Christmas bonus for having secured parts for them in this turkey which demanded of them less engagement than a Roger Moore 007 epic and, even better (!), set them up for numerous sequels until the kids gripped by the books finally add a few years and move onto movies for kids, (and adults!), which, unlike this junk, really DO entertain and amuse, e.g. 'Shrek', 'Toy Story', 'Antz' etc. etc.",6,1,3,26 December 2004
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful, inspiring film
","A beautiful,insightful and very moving film which is a joy to watch. The script and direction are superb and the film zips along at a 'page-turning' rate which will continually have you asking 'what happens next' as it is a rolled up thriller, love story and biography in one. For me, it was also a revelation in terms of Russell Crowe as an actor. I had admired his playing in 'Gladiator' and thought he was good fun to watch in 'Master and Commander' (while, on the other hand, I had thought his 'Robein Hood' was a disaster and a waste of talent all round - not least for including the usually marvellous Cate Blanchett in its proceedings as well!) In this film, though, Crowe is a revelation and shows some of the best movie screen acting I have ever witnessed. His portrayal of the lead character is achingly beautiful, with many high points (culminating in his 'Nobel Acceptance Speech' which had me on the verge of tears!) A marvellous film all round!",9,0,0,28 August 2011
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Biggest cinema disappointment so far this year
","Cate Blanchett's acting in the central role is as spectacular as in the first film, but she, (and everyone else involved), is totally let down by the writers of the script. The whole film plods along as, in popular history, the Spanish galleons allegedly did in the Armada of 1588 itself; top-heavy, over-manned and extremely sluggish in covering the ocean. Recent naval historians have revised such views and, while the film contains numerous other pieces of historical tosh, (Sir Francis Drake and Raleigh virtually sharing the command of the English fleet against the Armada??? I don't think so!), this was also abundantly true of the original film, 'Elizabeth'. The crucial difference, though, was that the original film had pace, humour, terrific insight into the nature of power and, simply, thrills, which made one more than ready to suspend disbelief and be swept along by the action as it unfolded. Although the latter film looks very good, (the costume department having done an especially fine job and the photography being on a par overall with the first film as well), there is just not the pace or human interest in it to sustain the attention of the audience over nearly two hours, (as testified to by the fact that this was the first film in 2007 which I had seen in a cinema in which more than one party walked out before the end!) As I say, a terrific disappointment, leaving one wishing the writers, (considering all of the assets they had their disposal, not least the massive talents of Ms. Blanchett), could meet the fate of those unfortunates who come under Walsingham's power in both films! The protracted scene in the original 'Elizabeth' where the plotters against her throne are arrested or otherwise dealt with to a background of achingly beautiful choral music was said to have been inspired by a similar scene in 'The Godfather'. Seeing 'Elizabeth - the Golden Age' reminds one how 'The Godfather' was also very rare indeed in having a sequel which at least matched the original film. If a third 'Elizabeth' is planned for future years, (the Essex rebellion and Elizabeth's final years?), the producers will need to consider very carefully what went wrong this time and not repeat it.",6,3,4,4 November 2007
Me Before You," As syrupy and watchable as they can get but I still have problems with the underlying message
","No disclosure of the ending/spoiler, but just to say I think some people (like me) will probably have problems with what is the essential underlying message of this film (which is what brings my rating down from a 7 or 8). These ratings would be justified purely on the basis of the acting (particularly the female lead who easily 'steals the show') (while the other main roles are also occupied well too) and the gorgeous location filming plus great sound track. If you want to enjoy these aspects and view a classic modern 'weepie' (without going too much into what the ending of the film seems to me really to imply), then this is definitely one you will enjoy.",6,0,3,23 November 2016
