Deja Vu," Amusing movie, but negligent towards public wisdom.
","It Can be a Spoiler - So read it after you see the movie! Travel in time is not a new topic. There are many movies based on it, some of them excellent works (such as the Jacket or Butterfly effect), but Dejavu has some logical problems. The movie, without the scenes about monitoring and traveling in time, is in no way a fantasy or Sci-Fi. But the very time traveling issue is a fantasy element which is not logically supported by any proper background. On the other hand, if such a facility exists, many more important applications are there for it and the movie could have chosen a stronger application for this. I can also mention it as a weakness that if such a machine uses so much energy and its usage causes black out in the city, why the creators have not foreseen a proper power plant to supply the required energy? Another point is that such a technology is more strategical than it is put in a single person's disposal so that he, at his own discretion and after the working hours can put it into operation all by himself, not needing any technical coordination with other departments or any permission from higher authorities.That the organization having the facility is not interested enough to do such an experiment before a police officer talks them into doing it shows a terrible lack of incentive and sort of carelessness which is not justifiable for any person or entity having such a technology. But As I mentioned earlier, it's really amusing and Denzel Washington plays fine(he did much better in 'Man on Fire' though).",7,1,3,16 May 2007
