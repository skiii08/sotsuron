Insidious: Chapter 2," I told you! (Don't you dare!)
","I told you guys, two years ago, when Insidious (chapter 1) came through. Here's a part of that review:'There are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of Wan when it comes to film. But he didn't relie on his talents, he used other people talents (like Kubrick's The Shining) to deliver a classic horror film. I'm not comparing Wan with Kubrick, but some of the camera works, some of the angles, are truly brilliant, rarely seen in a horror film. This is a movie you can analyze in many levels... 'The fact is that I was right. I saw James Wan's obsession with Kubrick's 'The Shining' (here's the part where I'm not being humble). This chapter 2, confirms it. I loved this film as much as I loved the first part. I would not argue with those who think this film and The Conjuring are the best horror films this year. They are perfect, though I liked most the Insidious series because I have a sick fanatism for this story in particular.It completed the circle, totally. I hope they won't ruin the third part coming soon. And I beg to Mr. Wan to continue delivering horror movies. This is what suits him. Thanks for this two beautiful classes on horror.Cheers from Argentina.",9,0,0,27 December 2013
Interstellar," Nolan overwhelms with a rock solid epic movie... again.
","Quantum physics and relativity are not easy subjects to understand if you're not a physic. Buy I can assure you this is a plot with thought provoking topics, not typically Hollywood pop-corn film. My only criticism is about the dialog in this one: way too cheesy and when not too cheesy, too complex to absorb in matter of seconds. It is undeniable that Chris Nolan did a good and hard work on this film. Visuals are just a backup of the story, and not as Kubrick's 2001 nor Quaron's Gravity; which put visuals up front leaving script behind. This is another kind of film. This is ambitious (not pretentious as some critics said) The good old Nolan couldn't disappoint his long-term fans with his twists, his (sometimes) cold and detached way of telling the story. But he manages to wrap it up upon his own errors. I said there were mistakes, I felt it a little too much complex, but that's because the subject is complex itself. And when we leave the confusing dialog scenes and the detached direction, he turns back 180ยบ and blushes all of us with his tenderness. That I felt a little awkward. But such a premise in the script, can't bring the movie down. The movie is solid as a rock. And it's unique in that level. Boy, you got to have the nuts to go and imagine this movie and put it all together like a puzzle. Well, it's C. Nolan, he has experience on that issue.Maybe not too far away, this film could be eclipsed by new scientific discoveries, theories refuted and so on. But nowadays, it seems scientifically accurate in terms of possibilities. This is not metaphysical, it's a possibility, like Schrodinger's cat. Like quantum mechanics.And I Know, most of the people didn't come to theater for that. They came for a Gravity approach or so.For me, it is a 9 because sometimes Nolan overwhelmed too much, and it's a long film for overwhelm people. But maybe that's my problem, I am not a quantum-physics scientist.. I Feel I could have enjoyed it more if I were one. But there's one thing for sure, he indulged me to go and learn more about this whole thing. I still enjoyed a lot and got carried away for the fantastic ending in my opinion.

Silver Linings Playbook," Cooper Flew Over DeNiro's Nest...
","I'm not a fan of romantic movies. In fact, I recently bad-reviewed Bradley Cooper's 'The Words' for the plot lacking thing those awesome actors did not so long ago. But then I saw Silver Linings Playbook. And it's so darn difficult to review! I have the feeling this is a very good movie in the genre, but I can hardly describe why. I saw that tandem (Deniro and Cooper) on an action flick about mindbroading drugs and all that stuff . I didn't like it, really, but seems this subject is to be exploited by the guys involved in this film.Bradley Cooper took a step forward in his career and made a nutcracking role. Not easy to pretend to be a bipolar if you're not one, though towards the end, he seems to control his temper more easy than I would 've thought, and that's the only flaw I can tell. Jennifer Lawrence is a shocking and beautiful girl who captived my attention all the movie through, and that's not easy for me to say. Not that I am a misoginist or something like that, but I often don't give too much credit on young girls on important roles. They tend to ruin all the prospect. But this is not the case. I love her, I definitely love her (hope my wife doesn't read this review). She's perfect.I mean, it resembled me a little to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, may be a tribute somewhere there. You know, the loonies on the path who are tough enough to face society and prejudices, the ones who are diminished by others and they point the finger on us, on things what we consider 'normality' and how sometimes you have to be very very special to fulfill a dream, or if not, to be clever enough to get yourself up together and do things right. Every member of Pat's family has an issue. Selfishness, tolerance, fanatism, pedanticism, quirk, pressures, ingenuity, obsessions, etc. A good point on the script is to vanish the psychiatry issue, and picture them as virtues somehow, instead of negative human qualities.So this is about redemption, this is about love, and this is about little pathos thing we all have and how we handle it. The linings of sickness and sanity sometimes are so thin. In love, specially. Still don't know how to justify my 9 out of 10 score. I simply loved it. Maybe because is an original piece, with a beautiful (and all-the-way- rocker) soundtrack -yeah, Stevie Wonder's 'Don't You Worry Bout a Thing' is a delicious choice, and so Zeppelin's 'What Is and What Should Never Be', with glimpses of DeNiro's awesomeness... we should cherish this one as a gem for the future, a cult movie of its own. It has a lot of great elements which merge together fine though it's a hell of a ride.DeNiro is the absolute man. He may be old, but has that shine I can barely describe on other actors. Yes, he's the Italian tough guy, yes, he's an old man autoportraiting himself nowadays, but he's a legend, and he's a key role in the story. And does it so well. He'd bet your daughter that he can.Sometimes the film has the predictability we hope for, but that's no harm. Romances must end well. And this one does. Though the paths which lead this beautiful story may be a little odd. Very, very good and touching movie. Cheers from Argentina.",9,2,5,11 January 2013
Insidious," Finally, a true horror film. Hard to be surpassed...
","Hats off to James Wan, I loved Insidious!!! And most of the merit goes to him. The story happens like many other Poltergeist-Paranormal Activity-ish films, but even with this simple argument (boy, we have a haunted house and it's a pain in the ass), we are tested in every scene. Our capacity to scare is tested with original tricks. I didn't notice, but there was not a single drop of blood in the whole film. Even with some borrowed tricks, it scared the hell out of me. The acting was so good, not a flaw, not a single overacting, but an adjusted performance of everyone involved. It also has a strange sense of humor in some parts of the movie, which I liked, similar to the Wes Craven's auto-parodies. Some of the scary parts are to collect and retain in our memories. I must repeat, without spoilers, that IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. That's what classics do. There are some cinematographic deliverances that made me enjoy extatically the mastership of Wan when it comes to film. But he didn't relie on his talents, he used his talents (like Kubrick's The Shining) to deliver a classic horror film. I'm not comparing Wan with Kubrick, but some of the camera works, some of the angles, are truly brilliant, rarely seen in a horror film. This is a movie you can analyze in many levels... I watched it again and again. I almost never watch a horror film more than once, since is very rare to find a gem like this in the genre and normally I pass the movies with the strange feeling of 'oh my god, this is the same movie I saw last week!' and I grew tired of horror films recently. But with Insidious, I didn't want it to finish. For me, having seen Poltergeist, I think that (Spielberg apart), Insidious is a masterpiece of horror in a similar level than Poltergeist, or even The Shining (cinematographically speaking). The next horror films, might be a little boring. If there were the Oscars for horror genre, James Wan would get all of them this year. He has stablished a mark with this film, and will be hard to be surpassed.Absolutely recommended. 9/10",9,1,4,24 June 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Amazing action, but no script
","It's quite difficult to review negatively one of my favorite franchises since I saw the first Avengers movie and totally loved it. But this film is not quite impressive as it seems to be. Joss Whedon had to stick to his plan: in Avengers the first, he managed to balance everything in order. Script was nearly perfect and action scenes were quite impressive but not too overwhelming. You felt (in Avengers first deliver) that it was not another Transformer-ish, Michael Bay-ish, film. Although darkish than the first one, Age of Ultron lacks of originality, but its worst flaw is the lack of well crafted dialog. Everything is mayhem. Chaotic. Script does not stand alone for its merits. This goes right for an action film, or kind of a B-movie. But we were expecting more. There are at least three or four amazing scenes with superb CGI, and again, Whedon gives every hero its right place, but something is missing comparing the two Avengers movies: script of the first one was flawless, this one is not.I know it's a high standard with a major casting. So we're expecting the best. And on script terms, the movie does not deliver a bit.Our villain (Ultron) is weaker -conceptually- than Loki. The man (or machine) is blabbering the whole movie through with unintelligible concepts, and some of the cast members looks too tired to carry on (Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr.) . I have an awkward feeling about this flick. The waiting took too long. Joss Whedon decided to present action before drama, nonsense chaos before logic. So then the results are quite obvious. He was too eagering to create a new Avengers generation when the actual one had not the opportunity to fly high. Man, this is as cheesy as can be. One-dimensional story.Our expectations, as fans of the first one, were not at all fulfilled. This looks like another Transformer's movie. Whatever happened to Thanos (end credits in the first one), I cannot guess. Studios and budgets can spoil everything. I felt they ruined a wonderful saga. Let's hope the next one surpass this second part, totally forgettable.I mean, it's not a bad movie, but on Avengers standards, this is a bluff.Cheers!",5,8,18,18 May 2015
The Artist," Something was very wrong with the Oscars...
","I just watched The Artist and let me tell you... those guys in Hollywood they've committed one of the biggest mistakes giving this film an Oscar. It's beyond my belief that you could sustain an award-winning picture on the tricks of a dog, the lavish grin of a few (good) actors and such a naive, yet unlovable script. Yes, I know... you can say that movies in the 20's and 30's had this kind of gimmicks and they lacked this thing that has evolved during the many years of cinema: an argument beyond a foolish, childish, non-sense love story. Let me tell you I love these kind of films, I've watched too many. Even the original stories are a little sharper than this. Even worst, mr. Hazanavicius offended me as a viewer a few times with these cheap analogies, like the one you see when the beautiful Berenice Bejo is watching Mr. Valentine (an obvious surname for a love-story character), being swallowed by sinking sands in the cinema, just as the same time he was 'sinking' in his career... is that a joke, Mr. Hazavicious? There were a few more, though, like the scene when Mr.Valentine is 'going down' the stairs (and so does his career) as Ms. Miller 'goes up' the same stairs as she 'climbs up' for the stardom. I don't like directors who mocks so deliberately from their viewers. Anyway, I'll take the offence. What on earth did the critics applaud? I think maybe this picture had to be rolled in color and with dialogues. So we could see the shallow script that unfolds in front of us. So we could see the mocking, childish pretension to be thought-provoking. This movie has nothing to do with the 20's nor the 30's. If you want to see that kind of movies, well... you know what to do. We don't need another foolish tribute, we need to think! We need to feel the experience of cinema! And with The Artist it happens almost never. You never get fond of any of the characters except for the astonishing beauty of Ms. Bejo. But you never get too involved. It is all packed, you know it will end like you want to, you know the love story will end good. My god! Even Casablanca had better intentions in its script! Please, don't mention that I said Casablanca and The Artist in the same sentence, since they had nothing to do with each other, and the second has got nothing to do with the award merit.Take Hugo Cabret, for example. Merges the 2011 way of thinking, sort of speak, but makes wonderful things with the ghost of Geo. Melies. I laughed, cried, loved each and every one of the characters... Scorsese astonished me in so many ways... He did deserve the Oscars. Strongly. And so did his beautiful Hugo.But this movie goes and wins the Oscar... oh, what a bluff. I'm speechless.I suggest to the members of the Academy to go and see The Great Dictator if they wanted to like a silent movie, and give the retroactive Oscar to it. It deserved it, and Chaplin deserved the Oscar they never gave him for that awesome piece of cinema. As a conclusion... The Artist wasn't a bad movie, but the best rating I can give to it is a 6 since it leaves with nothing but deceit. You will ask yourself as I did: did the Artist really deserve the Oscar's best picture? I'll give it a 6/10, And pretty much of it, I should blame the marvelous score who did deserve an Oscar. Go and see Hugo. Cheers from Argentina!",6,5,11,28 February 2012
Sinister," Not overrated, but close...
","I left the theater with mixed feelings. Reviews on IMDb blew my mind with comparisons (Insidious, one of my all time favourites) so I guess I gave Sinister a chance because of some good reviews. I'm not at all disappointed, but may be not the huge horror movie I expected to see.The thing with Sinister is that you have this wonderful music composed by Christopher Young. Chilly as hell. The best soundtrack for a horror movie in a while. Music is a factor of fear by itself in Sinister. I liked the plot though it may be redundant and have not so many surprises. I liked Ethan Hawke at the final part of the movie. He portraits so good his character. In fact, it has some connections with The Shining in order to character development. One man who begins to freak out and loses his temper and calm with things occurring. His annoying wife, though, spoiled the entire movie. She's not the bond Ethan needs to continue with his obsession to find the killer of those families. Nevertheless, Sinister has some good scare jumps, but lacks in gore. This was a movie which could've improved the path of Insidious. Of course, demons, haunted houses, but no James Wan. Neither gory scenes. But yes, good scares guaranteed. It is pretty solid plot, I find no holes in it, but from time to time, situations on the movie become a little overexposed and boring. We have a villain, people! Bagghul is badass, I liked the inventive on this issue: it becomes harder these days as horror movies go by, to create a menacing villain. This is the case, and that's a good point to mention. But I'm not sure this is THE horror movie of the decade. It's a good one, better than many, but still a little clichรฉed and lacks in development of the villain and his awful methods as well as my hunger for gore and spectacularity was not fulfilled.But it's still worth the watch. It is all-the-way tense (at least in Ethan's crime investigations and the eventual finding of Bagghul), but there were some scenes that conspired against perpetuating the tense feeling. Kind of relief scenes which could have been erased. Also, there is a lot of redundancy on common images and themes. C'mon, Bagghul! You could have killed some more families! And for those who ask; nothing to do with Saw.I liked Sinister, don't say I didn't. It deserves a 7 out of 10. Excellent soundtrack, good plot, better acting, tense moments, a little naive snuff and scary jumps spreaded once in a while. It is a 7. Cheers from Argentina!",7,1,3,20 November 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," You can fool some people some times but you cant fool all the people all the time
","This review's title goes to A. G. Iรฑarritu. How pretentious and messy can you get when you write and direct a script? Birdman-type. A whole new adjective for a movie suspiciously similar to Synecdoche New York, from Charlie Kaufman.This is not a movie theatre experience. This is self-pretentious, lisergic pseudo intellectualism. Not to say, plagiarism. What did we do to deserve this, I don't know. This movie is madness out of boring. Actors did quite well, but the film's clumsy and drags them along, merging with pseudo intellectual scripting, one-shot style in a NY theatre's backstage... this cannot be so over-hyped for Christ's sake.Worst movie Hollywood sold me in quite a long time. Can not understand the positivism about this. This is like 12 years of Slavery, now absolutely forgotten because it was a forgettable movie.St. Vincent, Gone Girl, even Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes)from Argentina, have lots of more fun than this, without the 'I know what's going on, you idiot, you don't know sh**' attitude from director. This kind of subliminal and liminal messages Iรฑarritu sends in the middle of this pretentious form of art as he claims is what pisses me off the most. I can even understand the bad script, the no-story plot. I can understand it. But I don't know how this guy manages to go with other filmmakers and stand in front of those men with his face unaltered. I'd be crying in shame asking for forgiveness. First, for robbing the plot from Charlie Kaufman. And then, for torturing all of us with that drum soundtrack that puts us on our nerves. For a drum solo story, go and see Whiplash. That's a movie where it fits well. I mean, even Babel had its moments. This is nude wrestling, one-shot theater pomposity I don't need in my life, and no one should have to suffer from this. I had to overcome Babel, giving it a chance, and saying I'd mostly liked it. I didn't want to confront the massive positive opinion about that. 21 grams.. passable, but pretentious too. Now Birdman is Iรฑarritu at his best: one of the most irritating directors of all time.Worst movie I've seen in a few years. Since Tree of Life, I guess.I'm sorry for Michael Keaton, they are using his talented gift to sell this rubbish. What happens next is that Keaton will still be Michael Keaton and we'll love him forever. I can not say the same on the person who shot this lame movie.",1,57,121,13 January 2015
The Conjuring," Mr. Wan did it again!!
","Now we have to admit that James Wan has created a style of his own in order to do scary movies. It began with Saw, then Dead Silence, then Insidious. He evolved again in The Conjuring. Saw it yesterday. Pop-corn chewing noises and coughs along the theater didn't happen at all throughout the second half of the movie. People were tense and scared as f**ck. I was, too.Wan's way of filming is particularly disturbing. He pulls out tricks you rarely see in a director nowadays. He knows faces can be scary as hell. He knows about the primal fear we all have for the possessed puppets. Scary witches, powerful demons, chilling strange sounds, anacronic music, wicked kids. He displays so much on screen is hard to memorize those tricks, but one thing is shure: they work. In The Conjuring, jumps and scares are rarely predictable. As a horror fan who saw lots of those movies I can't tell you how do I appreciate that. So you never know how you gonna be frightened out next time. That drives you crazy. You get so tense you forget to breathe. It's gripping and delightfully crafted. James Wan explores everything he can to twist a super known genre and manages to give it a fresh view.And this time, the movie has an excellent crescendo (like Insidious) but flaws a little at the end. I think it could have been a little longer and explore a little more on the grand finale. I didn't buy so much the end of the movie. Bethsheba was a badass old witch. But I won't be so harsh on the ending: I jumped and scared and got what I wanted to see: Mr. Wan did it again (in that 70's style). Cheers from Argentina.",9,0,2,9 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," We'll miss Nolan's Batman...
","So here I am reviewing this unique movie for those who might be interested in what do I think about 'The Dark Knight Rises'. I have to say it is a privilege to do so. But on the other hand, I think it's better to review the whole trilogy as one piece. Because it is that way intended.I've come from the theatre (gladly I saw it in IMAX-screen format) and my first impression is that Nolan caught me again with his same old formula. And it is not bad. Oh, what am I saying, it's still awesome for true comic and cinema lovers!!! Huge, astounding scenarios, spectacular script, but the most important of all. He hadn't forget to pay his tributes to acting roles. Even though you know there will be plenty of fetish actors. It happens on most directors. Yeah, but this was not Inception. Probably the most human of superheroes, Batman is cherished for being a 100% human being. Not for Hollywood standards, the Dark Knight had to be a pariah, border-limit vigilante, thoughtful and concerned maybe overwhelmed hero. And to make this set interesting, Batman had to be a 21st. century hero. That's what Chris Nolan quickly took advantage of. So he unfolds tricks and treats with super budgets but never forgetting the most important subjects of the Gotham world. The people. The individuals, the collective feeling. The poor, the lonely, the rejects. And surprise! FX are not the most important thing of all in the series. Though really amazing, they were never the strong point of the whole Dark Knight stories. Let me say it. If trust, care, belief, perseverance, friendship, love, mercy and hope are not the most important words in our language, we're absolutely done. So the whole series of this Nolan's Batman made a cult from these words. Doesn't matter the budget. Imagine what happened to the quirky Joel Schumacher's Batman. Doesn't matter the setting. Imagine Burton's ultra grotesque Gothic Batman, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Nolan gets the point from the start on Batman Begins. And repeats (with more or less luck) the spirit on his sequels.Well, TDKR is the perfect ending for a big big romance we all had in this last decade.He guarantees you villains with human touches and relivable statements, love-hate relationships, honor, pride, madness, humour, glamour, flawlessness, minimalism, humanism and heroism in the same dose. And God we loved that!!And that's the uncomfortable idea I felt when I left the room. It was over. The waiting was over. Four years of waiting plus three after Batman Begins makes seven. Almost a decade under the Nolan's shade. Almost a decade with those perfect impersonations of Gordon, Fox, Pennywise, Dent, Napier, now Bane and Blake, Tate and Selina Kyle. Almost a decade of a Bale's Bruce Wayne. The perfect Bruce. And I'm saying it as a Michael Keaton fan.And I also think of the casts all over these years. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman will never be so charming, memorable and breathtaking as they were on these Batman series. They achieved their new (or last) stand. I truly hope that Nolan agrees to do a new trilogy some time further. It could have not ended this way (we have a bit of an open and full of new- Batman-series ending). But if this really ends, I'd like to say thank you, Chris Nolan. You brought back our love and fuc**ing belief for the Batman. He was not a dancer, neither a ridiculous Maxwell Smart type of hero. Yeah, we got it. We could be heroes, just for one day. It's his legacy. We are the Batman. He represented all of us. And, as a message for C.Nolan, there's no Superman forecoming franchise capable of surpass this memorable trilogy. I put it on my list along with The Godfather, Star Wars and Back to the Future series. Above the Matrix's one, of course. I'm still a little sad. At this point TDKR is a bit irrelevant as an individual. It's the ending. Don't be so concerned about we the reviewers with technical aspects or script devariances think. We should shut up and behold the might of Nolan's Batman. Plus, you won't get a hint if TDKR is the first film you watch from the whole series. So, catch up f you didn't, Batman Begins, Dark Knight, then go sit on a cinema, and let yourself go. You won't be disappointed. Every dollar or peso, or lira will worth it. Enjoy with a sad tear, the finish of the Dark Knight series.But you MUST see it, in spite of all the reviewers here. Sure you won't care what people say about this. You just will go and see it for yourself. Cos you loved the two last ones, and absolutely will love this one as well. Cheers from Argentina.Long live the Batman.",9,7,15,11 August 2012
Flight," I'm not a hero..
","Bob Zemeckis got a hold on Forrest Gumps' Jenny. That poor little girl who got catched up with illegal things and sadly died from her illness. I think he based the whole movie 'Flight' upon this character in a way. And then, exploited it. With no less than success, because this is a movie full of human (and machine) mistakes.Denzel is the man. Absolutely, he's back on the road. Whip Whitaker is the portrait of a pariah, an incidental hero. Despite his good will, he 's not the reliable man, or pilot (though he manages as a brilliant one). A lot of big big struggle. Alcoholism is a harsh reality in our times. 'Flight' is maybe the best example on screen. An alcoholic portraited perfectly by our man Denzel. It can be very moving sometimes, and I think it is one of the movies you'd show up on an AA meeting. The story of a guy who cannot get rid from his addiction.As 'Cast Away', we have the memorable aviation incident. But this is only the beginning. Denzel unfolds a very complex character in search for the booze, and lastly, in search for the truth.A moving drama with good and bitter elements. John Goodman appears only a few minutes, but he's the relie on a very touching situation. 'Flight' reveals the hard fight about our very demons, even though you sprinkle the situation with altruistic moves. Even though you are the best man in the world; you have flaws, and those flaws are what you may become. He was not a hero, but after seeing this brilliant film, many people can stop and think about the issue. Alcoholism is a silent disease, mostly denied by those who suffer it, and by the society. Finally we have a naked truth about it, and it is very welcome on mainstream films. Sometimes I though it was a little dull in passages, but the whole experience was although, satisfactory. Because of the issues that are put on screen, the acting of the man, Denzel Washington and more than good supporting roles, I give it an eight. I liked it, very much. And I'd see it again, without hesitation.Cheers from Argentina.",8,0,0,30 December 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Oh, it was such a ride...
","Everything about this slapstick comedy horror sci-fi film has many things to consider. The first opinion I can give is that Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard put on script and on screen lots of classic horror influences. So that makes 'Cabin in the woods' a must see for every horror fan. Imagine mixing together Evil Dead, Jeepers Creepers, Cube, The Truman Show, 13 Ghosts, The Ring, IT and Braindead.. surely we find ourselves placed in one or another of these movies in several moments of the film, which could have been a mess.. or, in this case, useful to tell a different story, yet so familiar to us horror lovers. I think those references were put together on purpose, as a huge tribute film, certainly with sadistic humour, a few scary jumps, and not so many, but good gory scenes. I didn't like the ending, though; too much plot ambition and some holes in it. I think it's normal since the whole film worth the watch just for those elements. It's gritty, thrilling, entertaining, a little creepy. But mostly, cynical. Love cynical movies!!Still, Cabin in the woods is sooo weird. Ludicrously weird. That's good news for us fans. You'll finish watching it and asking -WTF did I just see? The final scenes are naturally misguided by an overthought plot. Not everybody can 'do a Nolan' script. But that's a little flaw in an intriguing, well-delivered film. It has a virtue, too. It makes you try to predict what is going to happen next, and you'll never guess it. That's the definition of a good thriller. Especially in the first parts where you are forced to think what's the connection between those weird guys at the control center and the boys in the cabin.You'll like it, dislike it, and WTF about it all in same proportions. But certainly remember it as it is: a fresh cynical horror film with old elements. Cheers from Argentina!",7,1,7,9 June 2012
