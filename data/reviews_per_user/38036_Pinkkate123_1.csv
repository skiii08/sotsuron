United 93," I'm still shaking
","This was an absolutely intense, emotional, and beautifully made movie. It was incredibly well acted and wonderfully shot. It was, of course, extremely difficult to sit through. In fact I found myself shaking for most of the movie. I saw a few people get up and leave, I guess it was too much for them to stomach. And no wonder. We (of course) all know how it ends, but that doesn't stop us from wanting a different ending and hoping that somehow, the plane wouldn't have crashed. The movie starts off like any normal movie, except for one thing: we are not introduced to one single 'main character', as you say. Instead, we get a feel for each of the people that comes up on screen (including the ones on the ground trying to make sense of this horrible situation). You are drawn into each and every one of their worlds without ever really having any kind of back story on them. Even though we have all seen the news footage of what happened on that day, it still hits you like a low-blow when it comes up on screen again. When I saw the second plane hit the world trade center, I had the same feelings that I had experienced that actual day of 9/11. It was gut wrenching and my heart sank. United 93 tells the story of the one plane that did not hit its target on 9/11 in the USA. And the movie makes you appreciate life and all of its glory. I don't think there was a single person in that theater with me that was not affected. Normally in a crowded theater, there are people talking amongst themselves and you can hear folks munching popcorn. But not for this movie. It was quiet to begin with, but near the end of the movie, when the credits started to roll, you could hear a pin drop. It just goes to show you the reality of this movie. How it was shot, the way the people on screen came together, and the wishful hoping of a different ending or outcome. All I have to say is: Bravo. And God Bless those souls on that plane.",Null,5,12,30 April 2006
