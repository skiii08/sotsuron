Vertigo," Overlooked Cinematography
","Certainly a classic, but one aspect of this film which seems to be always overlooked is the use of light and shadow.  Hitchcock and cinematographer Robert Burks use light and shadow in a way that has never been duplicated in any color film I have seen.  The effect is as strong as if it were shot in a black and white film noir or impressionistic style.  Film students, this is film making at its best.",10,4,5,18 June 1999
Scarface," Laughable
","What is there to like about this film?  Pacino's phony accent?  The fake violence?  The totally unbelievable plot?  A finale which defies logic and credibility?  Certainly `Scarface' is one of the worst movies of all time. A lot of people get their guts blown away, but so what?  How about a few interesting characters?  A story line that is at least halfway believable? Is this too much to ask?",1,39,84,30 November 2000
Citizen Kane," What can I add?
","What can I say that has not already been said about the greatest movie ever made?  What can I say about the acting, the unique narrative style, the ground-breaking cinematography?  How about this:  If you are a student of film, lesson number one is watching 'Citizen Kane.'",10,3,5,2 February 1999
Memento," Don't You Just Love Movies that Screw with Your Mind?
","I know what I saw.  I know what happened and how.  It is just after having my mind screwed with for two hours, I don't believe anything that I saw! MEMENTO is a wild ride that leads you down many paths -- most of which are dead ends.  Even when the truth is revealed you won't believe it!  I have to keep my comments very brief for fear that I may spoil this film for others. There are a few, brief slow parts, but use those to catch your breath -- the ride will start up again in a few seconds.",9,0,1,18 May 2001
Shakespeare in Love," C+
","A very good story and a very good performance by Joseph Fiennes helps this movie get a passing grade.  Unfortunately, the humor is too forced -- obviously they were trying too hard to be funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow keeps her accent up much better here than in 'Sliding Doors,' but she still needs practice staying in character.",6,0,0,4 January 1999
Snatch," The Worst Movie of 2000?
","'Snatch' may well be the worst movie I have seen over the past 12 months. Who ever told Guy Ritchie he can direct? Probably the same person who told him Madonna would make a good wife.There are so many places where this film went wrong, I don't know where to begin. But, I'll give it a shot.1. The movie is just too slow. Ritchie certainly is taking us for a wild ride, but the pace is almost as slow as an 80-year-old grandmother driving on the interstate. Ritchie spends too much time spinning his wheels before moving on.2. MTV-Style cinematography. Nothing really wrong with this, provide it is actually used to further the story and the pace of the film. But Ritchie uses it as a gimmick. His lame attemps to dazzle me actually bored me.3. The use of 'ethnic types' and 'ethnic humor.' Again, I have nothing against the use of ethnic humor or the use of race, provided it is not done in a mean spirited manner. Ritchie doesn't cross the line, but he does tread it. Actually, from his portrayals I can see that Ritchie's knowledge of ethnicity is limited to whatever is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His use of ethnic humor makes Ritchie look like an idiot.4. Eccentric characters. I love to see really eccentric characters in movies. But again, this is something Ritchie can't handle. Half his characters aren't eccentric enough, and the rest go so far off the deep end that they are not even credible, just one-dimensional. Its as if Ritchie is trying too hard. Also there is a lack of 'normal' characters for the eccentrics to play off of.The only positive thing I can say about 'Snatch' is that this is the best acting I have ever seen from Brad Pitt. He totally disappeared into his character. Unfortunately, even with Pitt 'Snatch' is not worth the time or money to see.",2,25,69,24 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Seen Better; Seen Worse
","There were scenes that brought me to the edge of my seat with excitement. There were scenes that went absolutely nowhere and made me want to yell, 'Come on!  Get on with it!'There are some great performances.  Then there's Ian McKellen talking as if his fake beard got caught in his mouth.For everything good one can say about 'Lord of the Rings,' there is something negative one can say.  This isn't a bad movie, but it is not memorable.  For all the fuss, I predict it will go the way of all recent big Oscar nominated films and be quickly forgotten.  This is an average movie at best.",3,1,2,13 February 2002
American Beauty," Hollywood's Idea of What an Art Film Looks Like
","Hollywood's latest attempt at imitating the art film genre, or at least imitating independent, cutting edge cinema, is nothing more than another example of the consistent mediocrity they've been feeding us for the past few years.First, I want to take my hat off to Conrad Hall's cinematography.  This just may be the best photographed film of the year.  But it does not make up for a poor script, directionless direction, and a series of characters that are nothing more than cliches.Haven't we seen the mid-life crises male played before?  Haven't we seen the wife and mother who is married to her career before?  Haven't we seen the gung-ho, homophobic Marine Corps colonel before?  Haven't we seen all these characters in better movies?  Don't get me started on the daughter -- she's nothing more than a 'Wednesday Addams wannabe' (re: 'The Addams Family).'American Beauty' is a must-miss movie.",3,1,2,25 October 1999
Man on the Moon," Carry as Carry
","Jim Carry gives a hit or miss performance as Andy Kaufman.  When he hits, he really hits.  Unfortunately, there are many more misses.When Carry does certain Kaufman characters, such as the Little Immigrant (aka Latka) and Tony Clifton, he gets the role down perfect.  But while playing Kaufman himself, Jim Carry is Jim Carry -- a weak actor who is overwhelmed by the material.  I never doubt that it is Carry and not Kaufman I am watching.On the other hand, Courtney Love totally disappears into her role.  Unlike Carry, she can act!",4,8,16,23 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg Redefines the War Movie
","The graphic, ugly, realistic depiction of violence in 'Saving Private Ryan' sets this film apart from all other war movies.  There is no glory in killing and dying here.But there is much more to 'Saving Private Ryan' than just us versus the enemy.  The film asks, 'What is the group's responsibility to the individual?  What is the individual's responsibility to the group?  What price is too high to pay in fulfilling these responsibilities?'  Spielberg in his film does not supply the answers.  If there are answers, it is left to the audience to come up with them.",10,0,0,4 February 1999
The Pianist," Polanski's Best?
","This is debatable, but The Pianist may be the best work Roman Polanski has ever done -- although this may be one of his most un-Polanski-like films. Unlike Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Ninth Gate, here evil eventually has to give way in the face of good.The film is also timely.  There has been in recent years an upswing in anti-Semitism.  Jewish studients in US and Canadian colleges report verbal and physical abuse by faculty and other students.  European nations ignore the rise of anti-Jewish violence in their own countries.  Arab press and websites praise Hitler, deny the Holocaust and call for a war of genocide against Jews. (How can one both praise Hitler and deny the Holocaust is beyond me, but I have read the articles!)The Pianist is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography.  But in watching this film,I do wonder if Polanski took any artistic license and added any autobiographical material of his own.  Szpilman's and Polanski's wartime experiences are similar.  This may well be the most personal film Polanski has ever made.",10,0,1,5 January 2003
Titanic," Average at best; Overrated at worst
","'Titanic' is an average film at its best.  But certainly it is the most overrated movie in history.OK, the visuals were great, and the last hour was exciting.  But the first two hours were nothing more than a routine, predictable love story that has been done over and over again.  Were you able to tell which characters would live and which would die the moment you first saw them enter the story?  If not, then you've only seen two or three movies in your entire life!And that dialog!  Ugg!Get to the theater late for this one.  Catch the last hour only.",4,2,3,2 February 1999
Titanic," Haven't we seen this before?
","Rich girl falls in love with poor boy, much to the dismay of her mother and fiance.  Hasn't this been done before?  Hasn't it been done better?  Hasn't it been done with dialog that is above the 3rd grade level?  The last hour was very exciting, but the first two were dull and predictable.",4,1,2,3 December 1998
Sweet and Lowdown," Allen is Back with a Labor of Love
","After 'Mighty Aphrodite,' I have not cared for Woody Allen's recent work. But with 'Sweet and Lowdown,' he is back in form -- although with his most un-Allen like comedy yet.This is a pseudo-documentary/biopic about (a fictitious) jazz 'legend,' Emmitt Ray.  What really puts this movie over the top is Sean Penn's performance as Ray, a sensitive but egotistical talent who treats women like dirt.  Ray's search for artistic perfection turns out to be a search for love.  Telling any more would ruin the movie.  See it for yourself -- even if you are not a Woody Allen fan.P.S.  Kudos to Samantha Morton on her performance, too.",8,0,0,28 December 1999
