Blade Runner 2049," save your money...Rent for free or $1.00
","Blade runner 2049. Yes. Does NOT deserve CAPS. I found this flick to be as bad as dune. This movie is Long. the movie is Tedious. This is Dreary. This movie is Boring. Not a worthy sequel to the original. I In the end I did not care whether or not the movie answered questions left over from the original. All that being said, the acting was good; the CGI was very good; the cinematography was good. Save your theater money, wait for the rental; for free or $1.00.",2,5,14,16 October 2017
