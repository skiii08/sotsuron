Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weak plot is an excuse to deliver special effects
","Well, I went into this movie as an avid Star Wars fan, fully expecting to be as disappointed by this movie as I was by ESB and ROJ. And, in this respect, I was not disappointed.From the very beginning, I realized how contrived everything felt. By the end of the movie I was still waiting for a significant plot to develop, but it never did. So I asked myself 'what was the plot?' ... and yes, I did come up with what all of this movie's defenders came up with. But I quickly realized that the whole thing was just an excuse for George Lucas to play with his special effects team. And he did a good job of it.It's just too bad that the rest of the movie, to be blunt, is terrible. It took me all of about 10 seconds to figure out who the bad guy is after he was introduced (and I avoided nearly all of the pre-movie hype) - although I will admit that this actually passed by the person I saw this with, as they were not as 'into' the Star Wars mythology as I am. The characters were, well, boring.I will admit that I'll still see the rest of this prequel's sequels. Probably for the same reason that I read all of the stupid books based on Star Wars- I got addicted when I was 7 back in the 70's and can't shake it.",4,0,1,11 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," As a stand-alone movie, it isn't good, but as a setup for Episode III it isn't bad.
","First off, let me say that Episode I was so bad I considered not seeing this movie (and I've seen and loved each of the original trilogy at least 6 times in theaters). That being said, I took the time to see Episode II expecting to be disappointed. Well, I wasn't TOTALLY disappointed, but will say that it still is FAR from a good movie. There's plenty of 'brain candy' - overly long (and only mediocre computer generated) chase/battle scenes, ridiculously long and badly written 'romantic' scenes (only saved by Natalie Portman's skimpy clothing), and plenty of third grade humor. Unfortunately, I don't like dishing out $7 for 2+ hours of this stuff - especially when I can get it for free with a TV combo of 'Friends' and 'Star Trek:TOS' (yes, some of the 'special' effects were that bad, gang). So what was right about Episode II? Well, I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I watched the movie for its undertones. And there are a few of them running through this movie. We get a feel for the causes of what will be Anakin's turn to the Dark Side, a peek at the future Imperial Army, motivation for Boba Fett, vulnerability of the Jedi Knights, ... and a few others (I don't want to list too many spoilers). All in all, these elements begin to put in place what could be a very dark and brooding Episode III.
Bottom line is that this is at best a fair movie, but it sets the stage for Episode III to be a very dark and enjoyable film. Get the message Mr. Lucas?",6,0,0,4 June 2002
