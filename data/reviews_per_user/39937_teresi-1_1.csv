Requiem for a Dream," Amazing
","This movie is so incredible, it absolutely leaves you speechless. When everything is going well for the characters, the viewer actually feels happy too, and when everything turns sour it can be hard to watch because you are so attached to the characters. The story is amazing and the cinematography is extremely creative and fun to watch. This is undoubtedly my favorite movie that I've ever seen, although it is not the movie I would choose to watch the most often because it is definitely a downer. If anyone is thinking about trying heroin, or deciding whether to stop, this may help you make up your mind. Otherwise, just see it for its emotional impact, watch it with your girlfriend and you'll realize why you still like her so much.",Null,0,1,8 November 2004
