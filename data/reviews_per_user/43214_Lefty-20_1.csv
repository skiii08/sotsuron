The Blair Witch Project," good movie for a student film project
","I'm not sure why there is so much hype surrounding this movie. I guess it is just great marketing. This is a bad movie -- the acting is bad, there is no story that I could detect, it is slow, and it isn't scary. Well, it's a bit scary for the last 3 minutes, and then it unexpectedly ends. Maybe people are mistaking the handheld-camera-induced nausea for terror.",2,1,3,4 August 1999
