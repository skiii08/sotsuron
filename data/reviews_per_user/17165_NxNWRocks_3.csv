Gremlins," Not Underrated, Just Underdeveloped
","It's strange how some films become not just successful, but hugely successful.  Revisiting this movie recently, it's apparent that not only is it obviously dated two decades later, but it's very much a film which is remembered as being better than it is.It requires an obvious suspension of disbelief to accept the very arbitrary rules of keeping a Mogwai (WHY does feeding it after midnight turn it into a Gremlin?)  That's par for the course for a blockbuster, and not a problem in itself.  The Mogwai's mechanical movement can't help but make it look fake, but we can overlook that too.  The real disappointment here is that the script, having crawled somewhat in the first half, falls away in the second, almost as if the Gremlins themselves had gotten to it in their chaotic manner.  Sure, we see scenes of havoc, but to what ultimate purpose?  The movie got a PG rating, but the Gremlins display the kind of behavior you wouldn't want kids to associate with, especially in the rowdy bar scene, during which Phobe Cates is behind the bar, inexplicably serving them drinks when most people would have high-tailed it out of there as soon as the little devils showed up.The film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone.  Yes, it's a comedy foremost, but with some horror thrown in.  The comedy doesn't entirely work, even and especially in the scenes where the monsters run amok, and the film's lack of real tension undermines any attempt at a darker quality.  It is not aided in the least by the totally nondescript Zach Galligan in the leading role.  He is so bland that if he didn't keep moving you would lose him in the wallpaper.  Hoyt Axton is also ineffective in a stiff, monotone performance as the hapless inventor father, whereas Francis Lee McCain gets to add some beef to her role as typical American Housewife with one of the movie's best scenes as she defends her house, most notably the kitchen, from the Gremlins.  Cates and Reinhold are pedestrian in their supporting roles. The writing is such that the characters pretty much sidle up to an underwhelming resolution, putting the cap on a movie that, like one of Peltzer's inventions, promises much but soon goes haywire.",2,16,41,10 August 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Dismal sequel
","This film has a cast of established actors, a renowned director at the helm and a continuance of the very believable CGI that was on display in the first film. Why then does it largely fail, and why is it so inferior to its predecessor? The answer lies in the script and its structure. After twenty minutes of set-up, most of the film involves various characters running around an island pursued by dinosaurs. We've seen this already in the first film, and the rehash here is done without spirit or wit, rendering it dull and mundane. What the paying public ought to have been clamoring for, and been shown much more of, is the paltry twenty minutes at the end featuring a T-Rex running amok in San Diego. It is extremely baffling why a movie that talks so much about the perils of man interacting with dinosaurs shows so little of that interaction in the urban setting of a big city, and even then with only one of the dinosaurs. In fact, for a blockbuster action movie  and a second go-round at that  it is bordering on criminal that they waste the viewers' time with so many ho-hum by-the-numbers sequences on the island.A key failure in this long middle passage of the film is that, besides the always-dependable Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, the principals are playing a number of underdeveloped characters that are hard to work up any real sympathy for. Julianne Moore turns in a poor, unbelievable performance as Malcolm's roving-scientist love interest. Vince Vaughn is miscast as a hired-hand photographer, but does not have much to work with. Postlethwaite stays the right side of over-the-top as a hired hunter, but for the most part the film shows that names and money alone do not make for a successful film.If the feeble script deserves any kind of credit, it would be for giving us a sense of empathy with the creatures, but to be truly invested in a movie, we also need to empathize with the characters, and have genuinely interesting things happen to them. For a blockbuster, it also helps to have a whiz-bang ending. This film has a hugely anti-climatic one, but the biggest transgression of all is its failure to entertain.",2,8,32,19 August 2007
Con Air," Effective OTT action caper
","'Con Air' is a film that inhabits the alternative universe where everything is highly combustible, bad guys are always larger-than-life and have a talent for quips, heroes can defy the laws of gravity and probability, and vehicles of all shapes and sizes have a tendency to crash spectacularly. There is nothing ostensibly wrong with this kind of film, but it is not for everyone, and some may be annoyed with the lack of reality as the stunts and improbable events pile up higher and higher.The movie is one of the better specimens of the over-the-top sub-genre of action movies, mainly due to an excellent cast list and a very fluid sense of direction. The editing hardly puts a scene wrong, and the plot holds the attention for a good two-thirds before it slides into ludicrous, badly-orchestrated overdrive at the end. One of the biggest bugbears is that some major plot points are overlooked along the way, such as who helped the bad guys obtain materials like plans of the plane, etc.Nicolas Cage does reasonably well in a role that is effectively a rewritten John McClane, but the clothes do not quite fit him right, and neither does the Deep South accent. While it would be very easy to see Bruce Willis romping around the plane if this were another 'Die Hard' sequel, there is something just a little off-key with Cage's character, an Army Ranger who is being paroled after seven years of a ten-year sentence for killing a man in a bar-room fight. This may partly be due to the over-emphasis on sugary romance featuring his wife and the daughter he has never met. It's possible to get behind Cage as he takes on the bad guys, but he just isn't as likable as McClane.On the other side of the cast, Malkovich and Buscemi both play very effective, believable psychopaths, and a scene of Buscemi's freed character stalking a little girl is among the most tension-filled in the film. The rest of the cast largely play their parts effectively.If you are willing to delve deep enough  and you do not need to examine the movie too closely to spot them  the flaws are there, as the goofs section indicates. Depending on your tolerance for a film to deliver an entertaining story over being entirely realistic or accurate, this may or may not be a problem. Most things considered, 'Con Air' has a lot going for it, the least of which being that it is neither 'Air Force One' or 'Executive Decision' to name but two fellow (and inferior) high-octane action movies featuring airplanes.",8,1,1,19 August 2007
