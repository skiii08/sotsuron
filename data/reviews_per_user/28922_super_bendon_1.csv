The Benchwarmers," Funniest movie I've seen
","The Benchwarmers was the funniest and best baseball movie i had ever seen before. It is non- stop funny through the whole movie. It may be hard to believe that Gus bullied Marcus when Gus was almost as short as him! There was one blooper that I do not know if I am correct on this, it was the scene when Gus was talking to Marcus and the camera was focusing in on him in the castle. The flaps that he closed in the scene before, were now open. You can tell by looking at the shadow behind Marcus. But, the after that, the flaps were back to closed. Overall, it was an excellent movie. 'Gus Bus','Richie Itchy', and 'Clarke the dork' are the best role models for bench warmers all around!",9,0,1,6 November 2006
