Iron Man 3," Make my marvel?
","Just returned from the cinema with mixed feelings...I really had high hopes for the third iron man movie and when i say high i mean SKY HIGH... I must say i wasn't a big iron man fan in my marvel comic book era (huge spidey fan) couldn't really bond with the character in the comics...But when the first iron man movie came out i was stunned , i was thrilled!It had everything a comic superhero movie should have: awesome cast (Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for the role just like Jackman was a perfect fit for wolverine) a good script , good humor and a decent villain!Iron man 2 was a nice sequel in my opinion .Not as good as the first movie but still it delivered the package for most of the fans of the franchise.The third movie ,well lets just say it was a HUGE disappointment.It felt rushed , full of plot holes , underdeveloped characters , the action scenes were numbered and it lacked the emotions and the superhero feeling of the two previous films.Iron man 3 was certainly NOT the movie people were waiting especially after two great films and the AVENGERS!!! Need i say more ?",6,0,1,17 May 2013
