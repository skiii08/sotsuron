The Legend of Bagger Vance," Finally a film everyone will enjoy!
","I had seen this movie at blockbuster for years, yet I never actually picked it up think it was boring. I mean it's about golf! This week I finally watched it and was very impressed with it! The acting by Damon, Smith, and The leading woman (Sorry can't remember her name) was fabulous! Golf never looked so much fun! I truly think this is a film for everyone! It has History,family, romance, sports, and drama. If you like any of those categories you will like this film! Not to mention I absolutely loved the costumes!:D Anyways I thought it was a triumphent story set in the Great Depression and celebrates the human spirit. I defiently recommend this film to anyone!",9,0,4,5 December 2009
