Conquest 1453," Splendid cinematography, spectacular battle sequences n one of the best sword fighting choreography.
","I first saw this on a dvd.
Revisited it recently on a blu ray which I own.
People may crib why n how, this n that, ifs n buts, lauda lasun, etc.
As an entertaining period war film, this film is an amazeballs.
I love Hollywood films. They too make fun of their villains n show their heroes as the best people.
Consider this as jus a film n enjoy the battle sequences.
Haven't seen much of Turkish cinema but this film n Valley of the Wolves made me a fan of their movies. Both r solid action entertainment.
The actor who played Hassan is terrific.
Fans of Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, Red Cliff, etc may enjoy this epic action film.",10,18,35,8 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Very slow movie with an unsatisfactory ending
","The film is about three persons who spend their time living in a bunker with no real tensions among them. Not at all gripping, too boring, clichéd, unoriginal with an absurd ending. It's a hybrid of War of the worlds n a segment from Sanitarium starring Lou diamond phillips. Even War of the world had a silly ending. There's a scene in which Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The thing, Final destination -3, Deathproof takes down an entire alien wotever by a single bottle-fire shot. Nowhere in the movie it's shown that she had some previous military or any training. The only saving grace was John Goodmans performance,(The gambler, Argo, Trumbo, The flintstones), the other cast members gave an OK performance. Very amateur direction by Dan Trachtenberg.",6,13,23,4 June 2016
Wind River," Renner's potrayal of a broken man who is keen on hunting any kinda predators, Sheridan's superb writing, the snowy landscape as another character makes this a must watch.
","I saw this few days back on a Blu-ray. As an avid fan of Taylor Sheridan, was looking forward to this without watching the trailer. It is a very beautifully shot, well acted and distressing crime drama. The vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop, it becomes a character in the film.
Wind River is able to showcase Sheridans directing and storytelling strengths.
From the dark border area (Sicario), to the scorching plains of Texas (Hell or ...) and to the frozen mountains in Wyoming in Wind river, the writer/director managed to make the landscape a character in the film. Jeremy Renner potrayed the role of a broken man who is keen on hunting the predators very well n he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The less said about the plot is better because one has to see this film rather than read about its plot.
The film has a very strong social message.
The films conclusion with the message was very horrifying n distressing.",9,102,120,17 December 2017
Train to Busan," Tensed, brutal/gory n very engaging. This is how zombie genre shud be.
","I am writing this review again.
I don't know how n y my earlier review of this film got deleted. I am a big fan of Korean thrillers n a bit bias but this film doesn't deserve anything below 9 from horror n thriller fans.I find movies set in a running train intriguing.
The aerial scenes were very well shot. The cinematography is spectacular n the editing crispy.
The film is loaded with tension n mayhem throughout.
The best character is the husband of the pregnant woman. One helluva selfless fella.Horror, especially zombie fans will not b disappointed.",10,29,72,17 September 2018
Underworld," Solid Gothic action flick about vampires n werewolves.
","I saw this first in a theatre in 2003. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - Kate Beckinsale is a vampire looking incredibly hot in ridiculously tight leather matrix style clothes whose job it is to eliminate the werewolves as part of the centuries old war between the two species. Her acting is good too. Things change when Beckinsale tries to protect a human, Speedman who is targetted by the werewolves for some reasons. The movie has a distinctively Gothic look, with great attention given to the backdrop. Every inch of the cinematography is polished. The architecture and costumes are true fashion statements. This world is so dense with aggressiveness it is almost surreal. Borrowing from The Matrix and Blade, the director Len Wiseman made Underworld more of a goth action flick n less of a vampire/werewolf. Nonetheless pretty enjoyable action flick. Was happy that none of those hand held shaky cam stuff was added.",9,7,10,19 February 2017
Kickboxer," Loved the training part of this gr8 martial art flick.
","Kickboxer is one of Van Dammes best films (not as good as Bloodsport though). Muay Thai fight sequences are choreographed very well. It is a predictable film n full of clichés. Now comes the training part man, JCVD having his legs pulled apart with ropes (ouch the groin man), kicking down palm trees (the shin bone hurts man), coconuts dropped onto him from a great height, raw meat tied to his legs so dogs would chase him (Usayn bolt can learn something man), being kept underwater whilst performing various kicks (Mickey Mehta stole ideas from JCVD) and finally training in the ruined temple where he could hear the noises made by the ancient warriors (is it a fantasy flick man). Nevertheless I enjoyed this the first time I saw on a rented VHS during the early nineties. I still own a DVD of it. Fans of the genre shud definitely own a DVD or blu ray of it. Directed by Mark DiSalle n David Worth (The perfect weapon n Lady dragon respectively).",9,1,1,9 May 2016
The 13th Warrior," Shibby, awesome, excellent, epic, adventure Viking flick.
","Hollywood shud make more movies like this. Its a good solid action adventure from start to finish. Virtually stunning and set designs that transport the viewers back in time for 100 mins. This movie was extremely well done... Great cinematography, excellent casting, well written script, plenty of action, fantastic battle scenes and one helluva plot. It is a wonderful, erie, scary, and exciting Viking flick. Fans of CONAN THE BABARIAN/DESTROYER, shud definitely own a DVD or blu ray of this epic adventure flick. Very underrated film. A good adventure made better being based on the actual diary of the main character. Sadly the movie was not promoted enough. I remember seeing this when it first released in the theatre in 1999. Without watching any trailer or reading anything or any expectations, I entered the theatre for a late nite show. By GOD, was totally surprised n happy to catch it on big screen. The battle scenes are generally fantastic and exciting to watch and come at a pretty fast pace all the way through the movie. The final confrontation was kinda scary. Directed by McTiernan (Die hard 1 n 3, Predator). Excellent music by Jerry Goldsmith. Awesome cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr. (A time to kill, Clash of titans@2010, Killing season). Star cast- Vladimir Kulich (Equalizer, Iron clad, Smokin aces). as Buliwyf. Antonio Banderas as Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan. Omar Sharif as Melchisidek n other less known actors who did decent job. Jus a lil reminder. This epic flick was before Gladiator,Lord of the rings,Troy,Kingdom of heaven,King Arthur,the New clash of the titans n the New Conan.",10,5,7,23 May 2016
12 Angry Men," It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from an ordinary premise.
","Saw this first time when I was in 5th grade. Thot it was jus chatting n no action. Saw it again in 9th grade n found it to be totally engaging n character driven movie. Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long. (Joseph Sweeney).",10,3,5,12 June 2016
Green Room," Nice lil survival thriller. A dash of out of furnace, deliverance, straw dogs, frontieres, judgement night.
","The slow beginning which really lets you get a feel for the characters, the progression into a claustrophobic unfamiliar backwoods. The film is nicely shot with emphasis on darkness and its color, and the photography of the landscapes effectively capture the ominousness of rainy Oregon backcountry. Nice cinematography by Sean Porter (Kumiko, The trust). Superb direction by Jeremy Saulnier. Saw Saulnier's debut movie 'Murder Party' shortly after its release in 2007. Found it to b decent. Loved his second film 'Blue Ruin'. Was highly anticipating his third film, Green room. The direction and cinematography are both fantastic. While watching this flick, the movies which came to my mind are Out of the furnace, Deliverance, Judgement night, Frontieres, Straw dogs. Performances are commendable from Yelchin (Fright night), Poots (Need for speed) and frequent Saulnier collaborator Macon Blair (Blue Ruin). However, an almost unrecognisable Patrick Stewart (X-men) steals the show as the ladder of the Nazis. There is also Mark Webber (13 Sins, Jessabelle) in a small n unrecognizable role. The sad side note is this was Anton Yelchin's final on-screen role.",8,6,14,10 July 2016
Point Break," Story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing.
","This movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action sequences and it's absolutely worth watching Fortunately, I'm an extreme sports enthusiast n i love rock climbing n mountain biking. It has the most spectacular visuals of surfing, snowboarding, rock climbing, wing-suiting, bike stunts, etc. The director Erickson Core himself did the cinematography. Hes an amateur director but veteran cinematographer. No wonder the film has exceptional cinematography with setting like surfing in the middle of the ocean, Angel falls and the Alps. The movie has remarkable camera work, the film was able to capture every crucial move with acute depth. I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances. Edgar Ramírez got a strong screen presence n he did a good job. It delivered what I expected. Its my kinda action flick. I hate those super hero films, except Nolan's Batman trilogy. Well story-wise this is just a mediocre movie, but the stunts and scenery make the 1 hour and 45 minutes worth the watch for those of us who enjoy that sort of thing. I know and understand what goes through the minds of extreme sports enthusiasts and why they do it. U cannot call it a remake of the original classic. It's jus inspired by the original.",9,21,33,5 June 2016
The Mummy," Solid entertainment. The remake starring Cruise is so bad....
","I first saw this in a theater in 1999. Revisted it recently with my kids on a DVD. I am writing the review of this as i was totally upset by the boring n lame Tom cruise's remake. Many compared this film to Indiana Jones n other treasure hunt films. Whatever the similarities, this film is pure fun. It is one of the best movies -- in terms of sheer entertainment. The pacing is good n the visuals top notch considering the era. It has monsters, thrills, humor and daring close calls. The opening sequences of Ancient Egypt are breathtaking as are the shots of new century Cairo. The special effects has fast paced skeletons, sandstorms, beetle hordes, fiery hail bombardments and hungry locusts/tiny monsters. Ther is little to think but plenty to enjoy in this movie. Director Sommer filmed the action in carefully composed widescreen shots, where it's always perfectly clear what's going on. If you're looking for some mindless fun with zero story, romance, good effects n monster fun then you'll probably like this film. The sequel was a decent film. The third starring Jet Li was a total letdown.",8,9,9,23 August 2017
Zodiac," Very immersive n detailed procedural film. Loved it.
","I saw this in 2007 when it first released in theater. Saw multiple times after that on a DVD which belongs in my collection. Felt the urge to write a review now as i recently saw the mediocre, Awakening the zodiac. U can call it an obsession with Zodiac. Having background information about the Zodiac and viewing it multiple times, I found it to be an immersive n highly detailed film. Found it to b very fascinating, very gripping n historically accurate film. This movie is an awesome thriller without fast-paced action, car chases, fight sequences, loud explosions or twist ending. This film is about thorough investigations, obsessions taking over the characters' lives, and grizzly murders. Very dialogue driven film. Technically a very accomplished film. Good direction, dialogue, acting, cinematography n screenplay. Slow paced but very immersive for every second, this film earns the right to slowly pull the viewers in. Top notch direction by Fincher n engaging screenplay by Vanderbilt. The movie boasts an amazing star cast n lovely performances by all.",9,2,2,6 August 2017
Sleepy Hollow," Awesome cinematography, an entertaining gothic horror film aft a long time.
","I first saw this twice in New Excelsior theatre in South Mumbai when it released circa 1999.
Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.
This film is a visual treat n a very entertaining film.
It has a creepy atmosphere, lovely visuals n musical score but a bit less scary.
When the character of Depp first arrives in the village, the scene looked like a painting on canvas.
The decapitations were brutal without spilling blood. The twist is good. There is a terrific action scene towards the end, a well shot chariot chase scene.
Some trivia : Walken's only dialogue in the movie is shhhh n Christopher Lee in a small role.",10,4,6,27 November 2016
The Hateful Eight," A dash of Peckinpah, Leone n Takeshi. The harsh weather n the set up is heavily inspired by The Great Silence n Wheels aka Tockovic.
","Tarantino's direction, the performance of the entire cast combined with the deeply engaging dialogues make for an awesome experience.
Robert Bridge Richardson's cinematography n Ennio Morricone's score adds more flavor.
The film is focused around the dialogues, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces a la Reservoir Dogs.
While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold a la The Great Silence.
The weather in this film is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters.
Good to see Kurt Russell with the coolest handle bar mustache. He was good in Bone Tomahawk too.
The story line was intriguing. Found a lil similar to Tockovic aka Wheels n Reservoir Dogs.",10,14,27,31 January 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," As an avid reader of the books n fan of the TV show, i thoroughly enjoyed this awesome flick.
","As an avid reader n collector of the Tintin comic books and a fan of the television show, i thoroughly njoyd this awesome flick. Fans of the original comic books will be happy to see a faithful adaptation of the books, and fans of Spielberg's Indiana Jones' series will be more than impressed with the action sequences. The animation is simply breath-taking and astonishingly lifelike for the most part. Once again i wanna state that the animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen. The action and especially the chase sequence was awesome. The film is gorgeous, and probably the best motion-capture rendering to date. The colors pop, the 3D is adequate, and the characters and settings are so lifelike they sometimes looked real. Simply put: a visual feast. Me n my kids had a good time in the theatre.",9,2,3,24 July 2016
BlacKkKlansman," Hilariously entertaining, tensed at times n pretty relevant.
","Colorado Springs police department's first black detective (John David Washington) gains the trust of the local KKK on the phone n they want to meet him in person.
The task of infiltration becomes complicated.
While he impersonates the white supremacist on the phone,
he sends his colleague, (Adam Driver), a Jew, to play him in person. This leads to all sorts of hilarious predicaments as well as some tensed situations.
Spike Lee is back in form.
Washington n Driver gave good performances.
Topher Grace as David Duke was top notch.",10,55,114,20 January 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Awesome film. Very entertaining inspite of the matter being serious n dark. The mamma's boy deserves an Oscar.
","Saw this in a theatre. Very entertaining film with relevant social issues. The film deserves best film Oscar n Rockwell best supporting actor.
The best part about this film is the character development and the awesome ensemble cast and their performances. 
Frances McDormands performance is solid but Sam Rockwell cannot be ignored n Woody Harrelson is always a treat to watch.
Another great aspect is the writing. McDonagh did a terrific job. He tackled the films serious dark material very well n made the film bearable to watch by adding enuff humor, unpredictability, tension n beautiful locations. The editing n cinematography is good too. This film was captivating n mesmerising n not at all slow as compared to most Oscar nominated films.
Havnt seen the directors previous films but will definitely check it out as after watchin this film i can b sure of em being good.",10,31,57,23 February 2018
Predator," One of the best action/sci fi/horror film.
","I saw this for the first time in the late 80s on a VHS n many times in the 90s. Revisited it recently almost aft 20 years. This movi is full of adrenaline action that it doesn't leave you room to breathe. John McTiernan's direction is terrific. This is a high octane chase thriller with lots of violent n gory moments. Action/horror/sci-fi fans will enjoy this. The jungle photography by Don McAlpine is itself a character. The casting is also amazing, Schwarzenegger, Weathers, Duke, Ventura n Sonny Landham. Stan Winstons creature effects r noteworthy n the film is helped greatly by the action and adventure score by Alan Silvestri.",9,4,4,13 July 2017
The Revenant," Hardy adds a lively touch to da film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than the crawling, moaning n groaning of Leo.
","The opening sequences are fantastic and should be seen on as big a screen as possible. Tom Hardy's character was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The cinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting  was great, but the story was monotonous and slow paced. Good cinematography and camera-work, and superb acting all round. From the films I have seen so far it should definitely win Best Cinematography. The scenery and backdrops are epic in scale and totally immersive. Tom Hardy blows Leo off screen for acting ability in this movie. Leo's role had a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning compared to what Hardy's role where in certain scenes he spoke with his eyes. The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! Sadly, this film borrows too much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, (extraordinary opening battle scene) n Gladiator with snow, (the wife and son flashbacks were way too similar and predictable). Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather slow film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than his actions. I was wondering why a fish would be eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration. The Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is very similar to what he did in Mallick's movies. Mirrione has had a notable collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh n he did a terrific job in all Ocean's trilogy but with Alejandro he gets lazy. He did a lazy job for Babel n again a lazy job for the revenant. This is the type of film you must see in the theaters, the experience is just heart pounding and exciting but in the past there have been better survival n revenge dramas. Sure thing, everyone likes Leo including me. He deserves an Oscar but at least not for this role.",9,10,17,28 February 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," A perfect example wher the remake is far superior to the original.
","Saw this on a DVD in 2006. Had seen the original on a VHS in the late 80s. Bought the dvds of the remakes. Felt like reviewing the remake as its much better than the original. Alexander Aja (High Tension) did a terrifc job in remaking Wes Cravens 1977 cult movie. Aja managed to greatly improve upon the flawed original in more ways than can be counted. This one is scarier, intense, a visceral experience n more technically improved remake coz of the larger budget and major studio backing. This movie is like a shotgun to your senses. The mood, atmosphere, and music add the perfect touch of edge of your seat creepiness. This is an extremely rare occurrence when a remake is far superior to the original. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre allows Aja to use the desert to its fullest to create a foreboding landscape. The hills and desert in bright yellows and subdued reds. The Moroccan locations that double for New Mexico r captured perfectly as a waste land totally isolated and foreboding at the same time.",10,4,8,22 January 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome action sequences, terrific sound effects n superb cgi. The chase sequence is awesome.
","I still remember seeing this movie for the first time in 1993 on a VHS. I was completely blown away by the action, special effects n sound. Bought the VHS in '94 n saw countless number of times that the VHS nearly got burned out. Bought a DVD recently n revisited it. T2 is a timeless movie. It is much better than the original. It has superb car chases, big guns, dynamic explosions, gore, tension, suspense, etc. The chase sequence is awesome and nail bitingly intense, it is one of the best action sequences ever made. The pacing is impeccable and the action sequences still stands out. This movie has awesome sound effects, perfect cinematography n impeccable editing. I don't think there must b an action fan who hasn't seen this movie. It has an awesome cgi, action n sound effects. The scene in the Institute where Arnie walks in slow motion with a shot gun n Patrick, the cold emotionless killer, approaching is so full of tension. This movie also has a creepy n dreadful atmosphere. The movie is very violent n action packed.",10,18,21,3 July 2017
Dangal," Awesome film n wonderful performance by Aamir. Disney n Aamir did a miracle with this film.
","I saw this with my family in a theatre. Awesome experience.
Aamir's acting, effort n most importantly his passion is what makes his cinema so damn unique. First thing Dangal has going for it is Aamir khan.
Aamir khan gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Phogat. He is the best actor in bollywood. Period. He shocked me by his transformation. I myself being a gym trainer knows the effort which goes in such kinda transformation. Without Aamir I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has.
The child actors were good too. The music was good. The direction by Tiwari was the best of 2016. This movie was never boring and full credit shud go to the director. The cinematography gave you a feeling as if what you are watching is real.
Overall you don't have to like wrestling or know wrestling to appreciate this movie. Its a wonderful movie. The movie is written very well. Superb screenplay n crispy editing.",10,128,175,23 December 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," now that's what i call method acting. The eyes and facial expression says it all.
","When I saw the trailer of dollars, that time only I predicted that Matthew's gonna win the best actor Oscar. But at the same time a lottuva people I know were placing their bets on Leonardo for wolf of ...I mean just look at Mathew, he looked like an hiv patient. His acting was too good man. In fact I jus saw this movie again on hbo, at 2 am. I dint got the time to write the review when I first saw the movie. I m writing this while am watching it on hbo. It's a sad thing that the cbfc here in India plays a spoilsport by censoring all the English movies even if it's aired after 1 am, while ignoring the trash bollywood item songs openly broadcasted in daylight. Fucktards, never cut the violence portrayed in bollywood movies but all action n horror movies are chopped here. Fucktards even went on to delete scenes from the girl with the dragon tattoo that too in theatres. Good Daniel Craig refused to allow that to happen. But ultimately it's people who wants to watch, they are deprived. Coming back to the movie, it was a very good movie with excellent acting and editing.",10,30,37,19 November 2014
The Exorcist," A classic horror film which started it all
","I know that this film has been reviewed to death and is pretty much known or has been seen by every horror fan in existence. So is there anything more to be said. Jus an obligation from another horror fan. Saw this in the mid 80s with my parents on a VHS. Bought the dvds of the trilogy n the 2 alternate prequels, The beginning n The dominion. Revisited this recently. Director William Friedkin did a masterful job of transforming William Peter Blattys book into a motion picture. He managed to create a real masterpiece. The direction is impeccable n the pacing effective n the tension is unbearable and there are some really frightening moments. The shot which forms the cover of the movie is a classic, the tall figure of Merrin (Max Von Sydow) as he stands in front of the house, about to confront the evil within is hauntingly memorable.The cast is excellent: Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller, Linda blair as the possessed girl n Lee J. Cobb as the detective.",10,1,1,22 January 2017
Duck You Sucker," One of the best Zapata western with lots of action n explosions.
","Saw this for the first time recently, the original 157 mins with Eng subs.
Honestly i did not enjoy this as compared to other Leone's films but the comic timings of Steiger n the screen presence of Coburn made it watchable.
A rapist Mexican thief and an ex-Irish Republican Army revolutionary join hands to rob a bank but involuntarily gets inducted in the Mexican revolution.
Although the last train blast scene looked very fake of that of a wooden train toy, but the film is loaded with action, specially the explosions n artillery guns' scenes reminded me of Rambo.
The film is a lil tedious, apart from the two lead characters, none of the others r memorable, the villains r not given enuff time n ther r no showdowns like most western films. The flashbacks scenes were lousy as two men run behind a woman n later one by one they both smooch her, wtf man.Steiger's role reminded me of Eli Wallach throughout the film but he acted good.",7,10,11,29 May 2020
Resident Evil," High octane zombi flick with an amazing laser defence system scene n ferocious dogs.
","I saw this first in a theatre in 2002. It is a fast-paced, high octane zombie flick filled with brisk action sequences. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - A virus has been released inside a secret underground lab, turning its workers into zombies, a military task force is deployed to take care of the problem. The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesh-eating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene, the zombified dogs, awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters, especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face, Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for action/horror/sci-fi films did a fine job with the direction.",9,11,16,19 February 2017
Avengers: Endgame," A disappointment when compared to Infinity War but still a fun watch for fans.
","I saw this with my entire family in a theater.
It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War.
In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.
The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds.
The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting.
Rocket's one liners were good though.",7,30,56,27 April 2019
The Dirty Dozen," Grandpa's fav film who was a bodybuilder, which goes on to prove that this film is indeed a testosterone filled action xtravaganza n one of my personal fav too.
","Is Posey (Clint Walker) still missing in action?Til date I have not been able to figure out what happened to the character of Samson Posey (Clint Walker).
During the mission at the crossroad Donald Duck site, we get to c his partner Bravos but not Posey.I first saw this in the mid 80s on a vhs, then on a vcd in the early 2000. Revisited it recently on a dvd which I own.
I dont know y i never get tired of these old films.Major Reisman (Marvin) is assigned a top-secret mission to train army's twelve worst convicts and turn them into elite soldiers to infiltrate and assault on a castle which will be filled up with high-ranking German officers. (Tarantino took the theatre filled up with the nazis in Inglorious Basterds).
The castle's destruction will weaken the enemies' chain of command before D-Day.
Those who survive the mission will be pardoned and returned to active duty at their former ranks.The film has plenty of laughs n get to know characters moment before the action starts.
Some may complain that the training n introduction part is given more emphasis than the actual mission but then it would hav lost the charm n affection we feel for the suicide squad team members.
Training n disciplining the twelve convicted men n making em learn how to operate as a group does takes time.
The film has lots of action, explosions, gun firing, tension n body count.
Editing is a bit weak considering the non elaborate death scenes.
The direction n the ensemble cast is top notch.
Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, John Cassavetes, Richard Jaeckel, George Kennedy, Robert Ryan, Robert Webber, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas as Maggott, the psychotic religious fanatic on the verge of insanity n Clint Walker as Samson Posey.I expected some showdown between Posey n the nazis, where Posey single handedly kill the nazis.",9,2,3,10 March 2019
Climax," In an attempt to be different, arty or jus to shock audiences, film makers resort to cheap stuff like repugnant n erotic gossips.....
","70 mins of erotic n repugnant gossips, unnecessary dance movements, loud music n the last 20 mins of headache inducing flickering lights, upside down shots of bizarre stuff n weird camera angles makes it a boring n abysmal film.
Pls don't call this cinema or film.
It is jus another lame excuse to pretend to be different n arty.",1,136,267,15 February 2019
The Pianist," A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.
","This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody.",10,58,65,9 September 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Fans of the 60s, McQueen (especially the character Hilts from The Great Escape), Mohammed Ali, Spaghetti Westerns, Corbucci n Zapata moustache will definitely love this.
","I saw this with my family in a theater.
My teenage son liked the film too as i had explained him about the 60s n everything related to this film.
As a fan of McQueen n Ali, Ioved this even more.The film is about an aging television actor (Caprio) and his stunt double friend (Pitt) n how both r looking for work. While the actor manages to land roles in Spaghetti Westerns, the stunt double is finding it hard to find work due to rumors that he killed his wife.The best part is the ending n Tarantino shud be applauded for the change.
It is brutal with solid face smashing, dog mayhem, etc.The scene where the stuntman (Pitt) goes visiting the Charles Mansion's ranch is creepy n it has a downright sinister vibe.Fans of Bruce Lee may be angry but trust me this film ain't racist at all. Myself a big fan of martial arts films n a fan of Lee too.
Most comedy films may sound racist if v start becoming cynical.
It is jus a comical take n not at all offensive.",10,69,114,18 August 2019
Insidious," Solid horror film by very talented fellas, Wan n Whannell.
","I saw this first on a DVD in 2011. As a fan of James Wan (Saw, Death sentence n Dead silence), i was excited to see this film. Insidious starts off on a routine note - a family moves into a new house and are absolutely in love with it. Soon strange, supernatural-like things start to happen n the son goes into coma after falling from a ladder in the attic. Sensibly the family moves into a new house. Thinking they've left those occurrences behind, they soon discover that it's not the house that was haunted but their son. Insidious was actually scary at some points. There were several pretty chilling set pieces and the ghost designs were particularly creepy. There is this one scene where the red demon is standing next to the sons bed n the granny inquires the demon. Man, that really terrified me. Another scene was the one wher someone is walking behind the curtains. While watching this scene i turned behind to check my window. The scary moments are well-paced and always effective. Creepy figures emerge from the shadows and appear in the background in an unpredictable fashion. The soundtrack complemented it well. The cast is remarkable. Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne n Lin Shaye all gave good performances.",9,2,3,19 February 2017
Schindler's List," Bring me the heads of Hitler, Himmler, Eichmann n Mengele.
","Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.
Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.",10,240,292,9 September 2013
Sultan," Wasn't boring......
","I was very reluctant to see this film. Firstly I cannot stand sallus films n secondly when i saw the trailer, i was scratching my head, is the movie on wrestling or boxing or MMA? It wasn't clear n i thot maybe sallu is just trying to fool audiences. My wife n kids had seen it n they loved it. My wife kept on pushing me to check this film. She even wants to buy a DVD. Most of the people I bump into, asked me shockingly, arrey Sultan nahi dekha? I said I don't want to. Finally got a chance to see this n honestly being forced to write a review. Cannot say no to her. The pros: 1)It wasn't boring 2)No overacting by Sallu 3)As an instructor myself, enjoyed some parts 4)As a fan of Randeep, i found his small role very convincing n nice. The guy looked like a trainer who's fighting his own inner demons. 5)Found Anushka cute.The cons: 1)Sallu doing park-our (running freestyle after the kites) was hilarious. It looked too fake man. Common, with that kinda weight n muscles, it's practically impossible. 2)Anuskha didn't look like a wrestler at all. The scene where she is doing pull ups, looked fake as her legs weren't shown. 3)In the second last match of the MMA, Sallu breaks his ribs n he manages to win the final bout. Common man. 4)They shud have just ended after the win in the 2nd last match. 5)Sallus body/muscles didn't look like a wrestler. He shud have cut down with Clen or some good diuretics or maybe some Oxand....",8,1,2,6 September 2016
The Mountain II," The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome.
","I saw this without seeing the first part but still i thoroughly enjoyed this film. At times the flashbacks were a bit confusing but as the film progressed, i understood everything.
The action is impressive, the acting is solid, the direction is first class, the special effects are brilliant and the cinematography awesome. I dont kno the names of the actors but all of em did a terrific job.
The film is very realistic n u feel the tension once the enemy surrounds the elite commandos. In fact the acting of the entire commando team was so good n convincing that i felt sad for each one of em after they get surrounded.
Basically the plot is a bit similar to Saving private Ryan but this film is more about patriotism n protecting homeland rather than invading another country.
This film is more about risking lives for a principle, more about protecting one's countrymen even if those countrymen are against u.
The explanation by the team leader to his fellow commando on saving the journalist was top notch. Even the contents of the letter which the team leader gives to the journalist was very well done.",10,55,111,10 August 2018
Drag Me to Hell," An absolute treat for the horror fans.
","I first saw this on a rented DVD in 2009. Revisited it recently. The plot - a loan officer declines to extend a gypsy womans mortgage thereby incurring a curse... the gypsy and the curse angle may sound similar to Stephen kings Thinner but the movie is an absolute treat for horror fans. Raimi created a truly frightening n tense horror film inspite of it being pg13. It is very tense and horrifying, also laugh-out-loud hilarious—and sometimes it's just flat-out insane. It has tons of jump scares. There is ample amount of tension in all of these moments. A very entertaining horror film. The film seems to offer up something to gross out and disturb everyone, the mark of any horror film. The effects are top-notch. Eyeballs pop out, staplers are wielded as deadly weapons, maggots are viciously vomited, nosebleeds jet across the room, etc. It is full of creepy sound effects and superb atmosphere n genuinely spooky score. Drag Me to Hell is an absolute treat for the genre faithful. Alison lohman n Justin long acted well.",9,1,1,27 March 2017
Saw," One of the best mystery thriller. Ain't no torture porn.
","Why do I want to write the review now on SAW ? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. I saw this movie for the first time in 2005. I have yet to see a movie that has brought such intensity. The music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it. An excellent soundtrack that keeps the heart racing as the victims running outta time. Da da daa. Da da daa was perfect for this kinda flick. Pretty low-budget and filmed in just a few days. Kudos to the makers James Wan and Leigh Whannell. Subsequent to my viewing of 'Saw', I went on to watch all 6 sequels. Unfortunately, all the other sequels weren't able to recapture the charm of the first one except for the 6th, which was decent.It has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. The best ending since Usual suspects. Many ppl will complain that Sixth sense had it but I wud difffer as Stir of echoes had similar. At least the story for Stir of echoes, appeared long before The Sixth Sense, in Richard Matheson's 1958 novel. Saw ain't no torture porn like many ppl believe. It's one of the best mystery thriller. The film stars Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, Michael Emerson, Ken Leung, Tobin Bell and Leigh Whannell.",10,3,7,29 May 2016
Sinister," Captivating, creepy, atmospheric n an excellent ominous, eerie soundtrack.
","I saw this first on a DVD in 2013. Revisited it recently. The movie was a like a breath of fresh air. The soundtrack was awesomely creepy n haunting. This movie had me glued from start to finish. I cud only recognise Ethan hawke from the star cast. Well the plot is basic - a family has moved into the wrong house where the previous tenants were murdered. It is not at all predictable n it is very terrifying. The title, Sinister aptly suits the movie. Captivating and creepy from the opening, it packs in plenty of scares from start to finish while also creating a horrifyingly unsettling atmosphere that engulfs you in same way that it grips the main character. Its a slow burn horror but not at all boring. The movie is full of atmosphere n tension. The creepy tapes, creepy kids, creepy drawings n most of all a very creepy n noteworthy villain, Mr Boogie. Scott Derrickson did a terrific job with the direction. Been a fan of his Exorcism of Emily.... As a pure chair-jumper, its right up there with the best. Derrickson knows how to put effective horror scenes on screen.",9,12,16,18 February 2017
3 Idiots," Finally a masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood. Period.
","Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film.
Its about the pursuit of happiness. 
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show. This guy is the best thing to happen to Bollywood. The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood.",10,55,71,9 September 2013
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," 0/10. Bring me the head of Marquis de Sade.
","Heard a lot since my teen days.
Finally saw this trash aft much resistance in my head.
Fast forwarded most scenes.
Terrible at all levels. This ain't no movie man.
Only followers of Anti-Christ will like n approve these kinda films.
This is for the third time i gave a movie zero. In fact I dont even consider this trash to be a movie.",1,37,61,29 March 2020
Don't Breathe," A must watch for thriller fans.
","Saw this last Sunday with my dad n son in theatre. It was on my watchlist for a very long time. It is a tense thriller. It is really intense, terrifying and with plenty of twists and turns. The script is brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a fast paced thriller. Acting was decent. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch. The frustration, anger, fear and desperation was portrayed well by these actors. Stephen Lang did a fantastic job as a blind army veteran which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice. Direction was awesome. Fede Alvarez did an awesome job. The idea of showing certain things which would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house was great. Some scenes were very well shot inspite of being in dark. U can feel that it's dark but as audience u know what's going on. The cinematography was very good by Pedro Luque. The background score by Roque Banos is one of the highlight. The editing was top notch. Eric L. Beason, Louise Ford n Gardner Gould did a fantastic job. It grossed over $90 million against a $9.9 million budget. Wow. Speaks volume. Movies which audience may find similar- Panic room, Wait until dark, The Collector, Livid. Sam Raimi n Fede Alvarez did a wonderful job of satisfying thriller fans.",9,4,9,16 September 2016
Sicario," The Deeper You Go, The Darker It Gets. ..
","Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins.",9,65,83,31 January 2016
The Descent," Claustrophobic survival horror thriller.
","Director Neil Marshall did a terrifc job. His previous film, dog soldiers is my fav too. Descent is loaded with horror, tension, suspense n action. The story follows six female friends, one of em still reeling from the death of her husband and daughter- as they embark on a caving expedition. One of em covertly changes the plans and takes the girls to an unmarked cave n like a true horror film they r trapped in it n under attack from forces ...... The movie effectively captures the atmosphere of being lost in the last possible place one would ever want to be lost. Though shot in a cave n wil hav more of scenes in dark, it was very well directed n one can make out what was going on. Marshall also establishes a slow-burning tension that develops between two friends and n allows it to boil over completely at the harrowing climax. This movie shocks the senses and provokes a sympathy for its characters trapped inside a hole in the ground with creepy hostile forces.",9,7,10,22 January 2017
The Shape of Water," All creatures r created equal.....
","Saw this in a theatre. Got enticed due to its huge Oscar nominations otherwise not a fan of Del torro's films n his last movie Crimson peak was a complete letdown for me. Surprisingly got impressed with this film as Del torro transported viewers into the evenings n wee hours of the 60s. He dealt with issues ranging from the authoritarian militarism, brutality, racism, anti-immigration, homophobia and workplace sexual harassment very well. The star cast n performances r top notch.",8,77,149,17 February 2018
Zombieland," Hop onto this drop tower ride n be ready for ur giggle to turn into a guffaw, tensing ur diaphragm n thereby gaining a solid ab workout.
","First saw this in 2010 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it recently. As a fan of Woody Harrelson, I enjoyed this even more.
The film follows four fellas making their way through the zombie apocalypse on a road trip.
While one fella has a set of rules to survive, another has a craving for Twinkies and stops to acquire some even with the threat of zombies roaming the countryside.
The list of rules, especially cardio, for surviving in the zombie-infested world, a clown-zombie n the drop tower ride, r all uniquely the highlight.",8,30,33,26 December 2019
30 Days of Night," A different vampire flick.
","I saw this first in a theatre in 2007. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Bought the dvds of this n the sequel. Its a must watch for horror/vampire movie fans. Very different concept. I cannot recall but i must hav seen one similar concept (vampires in alaska wher the sun doesn't rise for few days). Maybe it was an episode from tales from the crypt. The plot - a group of vampires attacks a small town in northern Alaska in the middle of winter when the sun doesn't rise for 30 days. Scary uh? Well its a very good horror/survival thriller. On a visual level, this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. There isn't a shot in the film that you wouldn't want to pause and admire. It is fast paced n well acted n directed. There's loads of blood, some flesh eating, lots of heads blown off, plenty of axe wounds, and arm ripped off, and some cut in two with a buzz saw. At times the editing became tedious coz of the fast cuts n shaky stuff which spoiled the action. Nonetheless a different vampire flick.",9,0,0,19 February 2017
Joker," Arthur Fleck: a case study of a young person's journey through madness n Pseudobulbar affect.
","This film surpassed all other films in portraying the slow descent into madness, caused by biological, psychological, social and familial factors.
It also highlighted the decaying n broken system n society's austerity.
The film is very dark, it has amazing cinematography n this year's best performance by Phoenix.
It has a very surrealistic feel n in fact a solid non horror film which is terrifying n poignant.",9,38,75,18 December 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Inspiring lead character in a very inspiring movie. One of my fav in my top 5.
","I saw this movie when i was a kid. Then again during high school days, then again with my kids. My kids loved it. One of the greatest movie of all time. Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to. Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, (ROBERT DUVALL) held a kind of mystery. My daughter kinda got scared of the character BOO. But once she saw the entire film, she too loved it. To me the character, Atticus Finch (GREGORY PECK) remains the top screen hero of all time. The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl . One of the most moving parts of the movie is when Atticus Finch is leaving the court room and the Reverend tells Scout to stand up your father is passing. This is a deeply moving and powerful film about right and wrong seen through the eyes of children. Mulligan's direction is flawless. Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert are brilliant. They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Excellent cinematography by Russel Harlan. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly and one of the best things is the music by Elmer Bernstein. Gregory peck's best performance and very inspiring character. Very inspiring movie. Waiting to own it on a blu-ray.",10,9,14,9 February 2016
Con Air," One of the best action of the late 90s. It belongs in my collection with Face off, Broken arrow n The rock.
","I saw this movie almost 20 years ago with my brother in Regal theatre in south Mumbai. Bought a blu ray. Will revisit soon. It's a very entertaining movie with non-stop action n lot's of explosions. So many actors as villains- Malkovich, Rhames, Buscemi, Trejo. Nic Cage really got into good shape for this film but his long hair on the neck side was funny. It has good one liners, plenty of actors, awesome action. It can b called one of the best action flick of the late 90s. Nic Cage was really having a good time, Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock, Con Air and Face Off all in a row. All solid movies. The only flaw is the editing which is a lil poor. The shootout at the deserted airfield deserves merits. A must buy for action fans.",10,5,7,1 December 2016
It Chapter Two," As a fan of the book n the original mini series n aft having enjoyed the remake chapter 1, i found this to b a well concluded chapter.
","I saw this film with my family in a theatre.
This film has amazing cinematography, direction n acting. The only thing missing is the camaraderie of the child actors but we do have some flashbacks.
Some scenes r very scary, especially the small girl, the mirror one n the Pennnywise's daughter one.
This film has lots of jump scares too.
The creature turning into a spider is like the one from Carpenter's The Thing.",8,56,97,11 September 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.
","The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.",10,10,15,5 March 2016
Parasite," Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.
","Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.
The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime, more of a social phenomenon.The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas n not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious.",10,86,146,4 February 2020
Halloween," Everything has already been said about this classic n ther seems to be lil left to say but as a fan of horror films, lemme contribute by praising how good this film is.
","I first saw this in the mid 80s on a vhs. It did scared me then. The mask, the music, the knife, the empty suburban area, the absence of parents, found all these things truly terrifying.
Saw it again in the mid 2000 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it few days back (Oct 2019).On Halloween night a six year old kid stabs his older sister to death. Was it cos she did fornication or the kid possessed or the kid simply a psychopath?
New generation fellas watching this film in today's time may find it difficult to digest that how can a six year old stab a grown up. Pure evil may be.
After spending fifteen years inside a sanitarium, without talking to anybody for fifteen years, the now grown up insane fella escapes by stealing a car. Even his psychiatrist (Donald Pleasance) thinks maybe the doctors must have taught him to drive. Pure evil maybe.
Our psycho returns to his hometown to buy a mask, a knife n to desecrate his sister's grave. He visits his now abandoned home. He carries his sister's tombstone so that he can place it next to a victim's body.
He starts killing promiscuous girls n boys n goes on a rampage with his unique mask n knife, until he comes face to face with a sexually repressed girl (Jamie Lee Curtis) who unleashes her energy.This film is without a doubt a very influential film within the horror genre and shud be seen by lovers of horror films.
The music by Carpenter is a character itself in this classic horror film.
The greenery in the suburbs is so soothing man.",10,1,1,3 November 2019
Tombstone," Ther is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it.
","I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs. Saw bits n pieces of it umpteenth number of times on Zstudio channel. Just revisited few days back on a blu-ray.
There is something about Doc Holliday n Val Kilmer nailed it. Val Kilmer is the first reason to see this flick. He potrayed the fearlessness n daring of a man with finesse
n the second good reason is Kurt Russell who with his handle bar moustache was awesome, specially in the last river shootout sequence n the third reason is the splendid star cast, Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Powers Boothe, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Stephen Lang n Michael Biehn as the notorious crazy Johnny Ringo. Biehns facial expression during the last confrontation was very convincing of that of nervousness n insanity. Russells facial expression after Doc tells him that he wont survive Ringos confrontation was top notch.
The dialogues r memorable, the theme of loyalty, family n friendship was good, the contrasting cinematography, from the dry set up leading to the river shoot-out n the final confrontation in the green woods. The only drawback is the romantic sub plot n the scene involving Michael Rooker, in one scene he is shown helping the lady climb the carriage along with Russell outside the safety of Charlton Hestons house n ........ u have to see to believe the scene.",9,6,9,26 December 2017
Final Destination," Very unique concept with lots of 'cool' death sequences. I love the franchise.
","I first saw this in 2001 on a TV channel. Cant remember whether it was hbo or local cable. Was very eager to watch this. By this time the VHS business had already closed in mumbai. The Lcd n vcd were total flop. Had seen n enjoyed all its sequels, especially the 5th part. Revisited the 1st recently on a DVD. I own all the parts. The plot of this movie was very refreshing n intriguing. A bunch of teens r heading off on a school trip n one of the fella falls asleep and has a bad dream/premonition that the plane they are on will explode just after it leaves the runway, mercilessly killing everyone on board. The fella causes a ruckus n is removed from the plane along with few others. Weirdly, the said plane does explode n as the tag line of the film says, u cant cheat death. The survivors r later followed by a sinister dark shadow.... The tension n suspense is maintained throughout. Very original concept. The writing is really unique. The gore and death scenes are really intense. The deaths are impressively choreographed, occasionally funny and liberally bloody. The acting is decent. The effects are done to great effect. There are some terrific scares here.",10,7,9,16 April 2017
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the most scariest n atmospheric movies of all time.
","I first saw this in the late 80s on a VHS. Used to own the entire franchise of this film on the VHS. Now a proud owner of this franchise n the remake on dvds. Revisited it recently on a DVD. This movie is one of the most atmospheric and scariest movies of all time. One of my all time fav horror film. It is one of the best work of writer/director Wes Craven's career. A dead psycho in a sweater, with razorblades for fingers is stalking kids in their sleep. He is able to murder the kids in their sleep. Thats scary enuff. Robert Englund is justifiably terrifying as Freddy, hes subtle and more quietly menacing. Veteran actor John Saxon n Ronee Blakley did well in their performances. Its also worth noting that this was Johnny Depps acting debut and he gets one of the films most enjoyable death sequence. The movie is not boring at all. The tension n suspense is adequate. This movie introduced us to one of the most memorable horror villains.",9,6,8,29 January 2017
Green Book," The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar.
","This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal.",10,40,73,30 December 2018
The Great Escape," I simply love this golden classic. In my top five fav film of all time.
","THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I wud say is timeless because its subject matter is just something thats never going to die or get old. Its a golden classic. I saw this movie so many times n still doesn't get burn out. The acting and character development is outstanding and is something that is hardly seen today. The direction is top notch. Each character is extremely well-developed. The director takes extra care to make sure we understand each of their roles and motivation. One of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Donald, Donald Pleasence, Richard Attenborough, David McCallum, John Leyton, Gordon Jackson.... and the list goes on.Â  Almost 3 hours long n you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you are ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. The editing is done by Ferris Webster. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueens case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. With Richard Attenborough as the leader and Steve McQueen as the unforgettable Cooler King. Its directed by John Sturges ( Bad Day at Black Rock, The Magnificent Seven, Joe Kidd).",10,4,6,31 March 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Truly this film is world's first globalised masterpiece.
","I really enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire. There is absolutely nothing wrong with an occasional feel good, happy ending to a movie, especially a movie which is fairly well written n has a good story. Slumdog Millionaire is one of those rare films that comes along every once in a while that is simply breathtaking. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film. But a true feel good in the end. Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Best direction by Danny Boyle. Slumdog Millionaire is much better than City of God. The message of grit and hope the movie carries has resonated with the people world over. It gives them the hope that not all is lost, things will become OK if you hang in there. Luck would favor you if you tread the straight path with perseverance. 'Jamal, son is it you? You have my blessings, go win it all'. That poor lady's wishes n prayers really came true.Professional actors always look like they are acting - its just that we get used to it. The people in this film for the most part are not professional actors, especially the kids, but they acted very well. Truly this film is the 'world's first globalised masterpiece'. One of the reasons why this is a feel-good film for me because one cannot help but along the way, rooting for Jamal to succeed. From every point of view, acting, direction, cinematography, music to any little detail of the film you name it, has been worked on almost to perfection, to create refreshing tale of love, betrayal, crime and Destiny. Screenplay by Simon Beaufoy was excellent. Music by A. R. Rahman was excellent. Cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle was excellent. Editing by Chris Dickens was excellent. Sound Mixing by Resul Pookutty, Richard Pryke, and Ian Tapp was excellent.",10,5,7,13 March 2016
