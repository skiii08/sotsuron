Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch Sucks Hard
","This flick may have had something interesting to say in its juxtaposition of sexual violence toward women and mindless cinematic violence- if it wasn't so busy hypocritically parading a bunch of young girls around in burlesque attire and school girl outfits.Like Inception, the scenes depicted in this film cease to hold any relevancy to the viewer. After the structure of the film is established it becomes utterly tiresome to watch, limply accosting us with a secondary reality concocted by the film's heroine to cope with the primary reality. We are then intermittently subjected to a tertiary reality the lead uses to cope with the horrors of the secondary reality.For example, rape in reality #1 = striptease in reality #2 = anime brawl in reality #3. We get it. It's not clever.The bulk of the film consists of the theft of mundane objects to aid in a breakout attempt. Acquisition of an object in reality #1 = striptease distraction and crafty sleight of hand in reality #2 = 15 minutes of cinematic trash in reality #3.People who dig it will claim it to be very cerebral when it's really just a vapid excuse for misplaced fetish and video game shenanigans.By the end, you'll be praying for a visit from Jon Hamm.",4,6,14,28 March 2011
