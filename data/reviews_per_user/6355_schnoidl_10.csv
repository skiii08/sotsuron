The Incredible Hulk," crappy physics always a dealbreaker
","it's hard enough to suspend disbelief for something like this, but when a body is running or jumping or throwing things, and the motion doesn't look right, that pops the bubble. aggravating that they can put so much effort into choreographing shots, blow all that money on extras and effects, yet they can't even be bothered to make the most elementary physics of the scene work. Bugs Bunny has a more convincing walk cycle, and I buy him as a character, no problem, totally transparent, and that was done with a bunch of pencil tests. Hulk and Abomination walk and run like marionettes. For all the computing power thrown at this, how hard can it be to set up a convincing dynamics rig? it's like running a formula one car on street tires or something.plus it's a little odd that the transformation would double the number of teeth in his mouth. and Abomination's scale relative to the Hulk varied wildly, sometimes three or four times his size, sometimes almost the same size. I like to get sucked into big comic book movies, but when my bullshit detector goes off every ten seconds, it kind of spoils it for me.if they ever need a supervillain called Wooden Man, William Hurt would be my first choice, he has about as little charisma as is possible.",6,2,5,1 August 2008
3:10 to Yuma," waste of attention
","beautifully shot, decent enough acting, but so full of holes that you just can't imagine how this script got approved. It had to cost a hundred million; don't the people chucking that money feel like making the extra effort to be sure the script would fool a twelve-year-old? boggles the mind. SOOO WEAK!!!! Ignore all the oh-my-god-it's-perfect comments and read the ones that slag it, especially the one star ones that point out all the ridiculous inconsistencies. it throws so many hooks in the water, tugs on the line, then tosses the rods in the lake, over and over. You want it to get better, and after you sit through so much of it it's just hard to stop, but when it ends, you wish you had walked away a long time ago. Come on people, with a little effort my suspension of disbelief is happy to play along, but this is just so half-assed. AVOID. bleh.",2,7,11,8 November 2008
Inglourious Basterds," masturbation
","Boy does Quentin Tarantino love to make him some movies. Well good for him, but that is not sufficient justification for asking for my attention. There were some moments that really moved me, like when von Hammersmark was on the doctor's table, she was like a cornered panther, and Landa was a delightful character, but far too often, I could feel Tarantino's hot breath on my neck yammering away about what a genius he is. Oh boy look, I blowed up the cinema. The rare times there was anything like a suspension of disbelief were the indulgent bits of gore, like the finger in the wound, or the carving of the swastikas in the forehead, which i can still feel. If I want that kind of cheapshot, I'll watch ER or something. If you are looking at a character and thinking about them as an interesting casting choice, then the director has failed. Hitler was many things, but he was not a chewed-up piece of gristle, and casting that actor in the role is just obnoxious. I rarely like seeing big name actors in movies, and seeing Brad Pitt means I'm watching Brad Pitt, not the soldier he's playing (ok, he was great in that Guy Ritchie movie as the Irish fighter, but that's an exception); i wish the Hollywood beancounters would stop wrecking movies with that crap. And whose stupid stupid idea was it to put Mike Myers in this? That just completely killed that scene to death. Unless this director, whose name I don't even want to write again, has some big life-changing experience that makes him reconsider his penchant for grandiose masturbation, I don't think i will ever want to see a thing he does again. If i want to watch somebody jerk off, I'll just get some porn.",5,8,19,1 September 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," gorgeous but the bubble keeps popping
","visually stunning, but unless I bring a Walkman, oh sorry, iPod, I need a little more. As a compositor, sometimes it's hard for me to watch CGI bonanzas like this; little things like shadow color balance being off blow my suspension of disbelief in an instant. It annoys me to no end that they can put tons of expert attention into texturing and lighting but then the walk cycles are clumsy giveaways. Just as i'm getting sucked in, something lazy blows it for me. When the little guys were shoving a big door closed, they looked like puppets. And when people get tossed across a room, their path should be an arc unless they're traveling superfast, NEVER a straight line. In the beginning, when the kid was talking, his lips never closed for Ps and Bs and stuff, and that little animal part of your brain just can't help but notice. I could find at least fifty examples if i watched it again; i rarely got sucked in for more than half a minute before another stinker dead-fished my face. And those of us who are fans of dark weird stories like we hope this would be really do NOT need cheesy overblown choirs to tell us when it's all grandiose and epic; would suit me just fine if i never had to hear cheesy bombastic cliché soundtracks ever again (why does Danny Elfman get all the jobs? he's gotten so intensely boring). The schmaltzy tearjerking moments had a lot of the people around me snickering. I thought the German voice-over was horrible, then I saw why: Seth McFarlane? what in hell was the thinking behind that? and the Barry Manilow thing was cute for a minute, but playing it over the credits was like a final smirky flip off. and the glitchy credits treatment was dumb. BUT, in between the buzzkills, there are some seriously stunning visuals. LOVED the golden army, and the big space they were kept in. The troll market was a total delight, wish we could have spent more time there. But come on, if you aren't going to go that final five percent, just don't even bother.",7,2,7,14 July 2008
Non-Stop," such a huge spoiler
","it was those two guys. one of them did a trick thing to make you think it wasn't him, but he was just being smart.when you get to the end, and the two guys are standing there speechifying their implausible garbage about why this was all necessary, you will have your fingers in your ears going leh- leh-leh. watch out Liam, that point blank shot right to the chest didn't keep him down!cheap misdirects, lots of people intentionally made to look suspicious and then revealed to be benign. Like that bulbous-nosed Slavic cop namedof courseRiley. and then you get to the end and you realize all the stupid loose ends were just there to make you go woo-woo, and then you start to feel pretty cheap and used. Hmm, how do you spend 50 million and almost never leave the room?Also, Julianne Moore plays Julianne Moore, like she pretty much always does, her waxen corpse so luminous, her expertly coiffed mane flowing just so, her tortoise dentition just so literate.",1,10,19,4 June 2014
Mr. Nobody," impossibly twee and affected
","Losing the forest for the trees, this excruciatingly overwrought pile of desperate artiness is so mired in trying to impress, it becomes impossible to watch. If you are a fan of such strutting garbage as Matthew Barney, then you'll gobble this right up and feel bettered for the experience. If you have a reasonably functioning bullshit detector, your skin will start to itch by a half hour in. Individual details are exquisite, and the director's craft is very elegant and refined, but the visibly heaving and straining effort to do something Vast and Poetic knocks the whole thing flat on its face. It's also one of those films that relentlessly quotes scenes from other films, which I find so aggravating, more about wink-winking how clever the director is than adding any useful content. Jared Leto also sports one of the most annoying haircuts I've ever seen on a man, and his inverted androgyny feels like he took the worst from both genders and forgot why he came into the room. When it finally ends, the director's satisfaction with his supposed Grand Reveal is one massive saccharine fart of nothing at all.",3,18,35,2 July 2012
Alice in Wonderland," waste of attention
","Some movies, you know from the first scene that you are going to be sucked into a loveletter, charmed and delighted, immersed in wonder. I wish I had gone to one of those instead. Not once the entire movie did I have the slightest suspension of disbelief, not once did I invest a drop of emotion or anticipation. The CG was some of the worst I've seen, really inexcusable; really, EVERY single item looked fake. The Tweedledoofs were smudgy, all the rock textures were so obviously synthetic, everything was just plastic looking. And my favorite bone to pick, just the simple physical motion was ridiculous. When that big shaggy sharkdog was running, it was so blatantly animation. Even Depp's little (why? why???!!) break dancing bit was just such a weak effort. And the...'performances'? Every single character was as flat as a card, especially the dishwater-banal utterly charisma-free lead. And who was young Alice, some producer's daughter? She looked like she couldn't keep from giggling, like she was the guest of honor at a hugely expensive party or something, which she probably was. And why would anyone cast Anne Hathaway in anything, ever? I find her so unwatchable. And why was Crispin Glover in this, except so somebody could go oh wow, it's that weird guy? Danny Elfman needs to take a break from grinding out his stale goading and reconnect with his weirdo roots; he has become the exact opposite of what he once was. Why oh why, Hollywood? Is there anyone there who really loves movies? I thought Tim Burton was one of them, but this is just him licking a mirror.",1,21,39,7 March 2010
Mary and Max," be warned
","This was going to be one of my favorite movies ever, right up until the unbelievably lame cop- out ending. My date and I were both dumped into a depression, so it's not just me. Back and forth the movie gives and takes away hope, then gives it back, and then you get to the end...and whiff. Somebody decided it would be too predictable to end on a happy note, so they got all artsy and clever and...predictable. I really wanted to punch the filmmaker in the face at that point. There is an implied contract if you take on someone's attention and emotions for this long a period of time (only 80 minutes? god it seemed like so much more than that by that point), and if you aren't going to play the game out until the end, then I think that's very rude and self- indulgent. It's like when Forrest Gump steps up to the microphone, and everybody is waiting to hear The Big Punchline, then the mic howls with feedback instead, and everybody cheers, and we get a fake airball instead of something worth the effort of the journey.All that said, right up until that stupid stupid ending, what an incredibly charming movie, so full of absurd details and love for textures and the minutae of neuroses. What a waste that it ended on such a pathetic non-idea.",6,11,26,24 March 2011
Lucy," stunningly bad
","STOP GIVING LUC BESSON MONEY!!!how does this infantile goon still keep finding money for his crap? he's so lazy, he even steals from himself. Bad enough we have to see the terminally overused chewing-gum-faced Scarlett in yet another superchick role (and this is no doubt VERY far from the last time), destroying all possibility of getting sucked in in the slightest. ButMorgan Freeman? Really? REALLY?!?!?Hollywood, with your stupid insistence on the same crappy recipe for sucking the life out of everything, how do you keep a straight face and blame piracy for your slipping profits?funny how this is called science fiction. it's techno-farce. JING, 20% ACHIEVED! MAKE THE HAIR BRUNETTE!! you people who insist this is brilliant are either overpaid astroturfers or just stupid. Why oh why is there almost never any decent actual sci-fi anymore? It's always so dumbed down, as if the audience for such things are the average body-sprayed shaved- crotch knucklehead that can only deal with the simplest of ideas. If you didn't laugh painfully at this worthless implausible mess, then please stop cluttering up IMDb with your opinions.",1,88,191,7 October 2014
Moon," weak, implausible
","I really don't understand all the positive reviews here. I came here at about 2/3 of the way through to see if anyone else thought it was a major stinker, but was surprised to see almost nothing under 8 stars. I didn't get anything even remotely philosophical about it, it's just some lonely guy slowly rotting (from...radiation? never mentioned), with a couple of hallucinations that crop up at the beginning but are never heard from again. He and the buddy hardly talk at all, no deep discussions, just some general snottiness, some collaboration, and then the end. Big wow.So many inconsistencies: if he was still alive in the vehicle, wouldn't medical monitoring have picked that up? All that massive infrastructure, and no auto-tow-truck bot to go pull the vehicle out of the dust? And why an Indiana Jones warehouse hallway of cells? Why did the vehicle have brake lights? How would a vehicle headed for earth, designed to hold solid objects possibly not kill a man? Why would its temperature be expected to remain below lethal, why would it be expected to not hit so hard as to kill anyone inside? And when he climbed in, you could see the walls wobble like they were cardboard. And on and on. Sorry, I'm not being picky, but these things just jump right out at me. And only in one shot near the end did we see anything like the reduced gravity on the moon; when the vehicle moved, the object on the back swung along merrily.And hey, let's just make all the inside door corners 45 degrees, that way we'll all know it's the future. So lazy.Usually any movie reviewed on here, no matter how awful, will have a bunch of people going OMG best thing ever, but there are always at least a few people who can smell a stinker. For some reason everyone seems to think it's all that, and I really really disagree. I rarely want to check out of a movie before the end; wish I had never watched this at all.",4,24,53,27 October 2009
