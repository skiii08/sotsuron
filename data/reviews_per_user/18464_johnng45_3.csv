Casablanca," The Best Hollywood Movie Of All Time !!!!!!
","Humprey Bogart & Igrid Bergman at their best !I still remember the song 'As time goes by'. What a romantic story ! Don't you remember 'Hey, kid he's looking at you!'? Two lovers(Humprey bogart & Ingrid Bergman) loved with each others, but one of them followed the patriot ( Paul Henreid ).It's full of funny dialogues!  The story contains romance, love & democracy. Democracy live long !!!! What a lovely movie !!! What do you guys ask for ? Everyone must see this one 9/10!",9,0,0,21 August 2003
The Fan," 'Not The Best Film,But Worth review !'
","It's a good film !!!! Robert DeNiro didn't disappoint me !!! Snipes did a good job !!!! Just I think the film was too sad,nothing is happy.....  by the way,Adrew J Ferchland as DeNiro's son was GREAT GREAT GREAT ! I felt very very sad when he cried finally..... I think people should try to like this movie :-),just try it. It's an upset film tho....",6,2,5,25 August 2002
Home Alone," It was a magical movie !
","A great movie composed by John Williams !!!I love the Main title music in the beginning of the film !!!This was the one of John's best music ! I love E.T, JAWS,Home alone 2 & Jurassic park !It's one of my favorite movie in ages !! The first could be better than the 2nd !!! He played the two bad guys was so CLEVER !! Macaulay Culkin wake up and he found his family was totally disappeared. Was this magic ?  The important thing appeared in the movie was 'Having family is happiness'. Don't you agree with that ? Get this movie at homes,go ahead !!!",9,0,1,4 December 2002
