United 93," Must See
","This is probably the best movie I'll never see again. I can't say that for certain, but right now I feel that I wouldn't want to see it again. However, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I highly recommend it for anyone that feels they are ready to deal with such a sensitive subject again.This is probably the least 'Hollywood' movie I've ever seen. It was superbly presented, and it almost makes you feel like there was a floating camera there that documented the actual events. A true 'fly on the wall' kind of feel if you will. Mundane, ordinary conversations such as one between pilots regarding how many days they're having to fly that month are portrayed so realistically. The real time aspect helps to give a feel of reality while creating a sense of building anticipation and anxiety that takes you back to that day. You could have heard a pin drop in the theater until the latter scenes. Then you begin to hear an almost universal whimper and sniffle from throughout the theater.It gives great insight into how the events of that day truly changed our everyday mindset. When you see the ATC and FAA reactions to the fact that they think they have a hijacking in progress it's angering until you remember how it used to be pre-9/11. We were all guilty of the attitude we would now chastise anyone for taking. I don't know it for sure, but I understand that most or all of the ATC and FAA agents in the film are the actual ones that dealt with the events of that day, not actors. You also won't likely recognize many, if any, of the actors in any of the other roles. That aspect helps to make everyone come across as just an ordinary, everyday person dealing with an extraordinary situation. After seeing the movie I went and checked out pictures of the Untied 93 hijackers, and the casting for those roles was absolutely perfect. I'm proud of the fact that this movie was made in the way that it was. I was afraid we were going to see an over-dramatized, sensationalized version of the story, but it was done very respectfully.",10,1,3,6 June 2006
