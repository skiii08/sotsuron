The Blair Witch Project," The main point? It simply didn't scare me.
","From a cinematic standpoint, the idea of finding year-old film footage that tells of the last days of several students involved in a project that gets them in over their heads is unique and exciting.  That was why I went to see the film.  The execution of this idea, is where the movie falls way short. I got with the spirit early on, but by the time the lame excuses and frustrations are bantered about for about the four hundredth time, you find yourself wanting it to end quickly.  The only thing scary was the seasick look on my face while trying to persevere in watching the bouncing frames until the end, which came far too late and was disappointing to say the least.  It becomes obvious through the utter lack of preparation and resourcefulness on the part of the characters that they don't belong on a cub scout day hike, much less orienteering through deep woods.  Perhaps this should be chalked up to artistic license, but I would like to know where they bought the batteries for their video cameras, because I can't get mine to last for 45 minutes of shooting, must less 3-4 days in the damp woods. I would overlook this silly point, IF the movie had been worthy in other respects.  What can I say good about this film??  At first, the method was VERY convincing and I found myself thinking that the story might somehow be REAL.  Unfortunately, about halfway through I'd had enough and was actually squirming, wanting to get up and leave.  If anybody cares to write a sequel, consider having the students get CAPTURED about halfway through, and have the remaining footage taken by their captors. Maybe we will revisit this in about 20 years and it will actually be frightening, and not only because of the price I paid for admission.",Null,0,0,29 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funny as the TV show
","South Park, B, L and U. was as funny as the TV show, just a lot more of it. Except that the events on the TV show generally don't affect people outside the South Park town limits, here they start a major war between two countries.  I only had a few problems with this one.  First, Chef didn't have a song of his own.  What an oversight!  Second, I saw it at the movies instead of on video so I couldn't keep repeating the parts that went by too fast or repeat parts that are just darn FUNNY!  When it comes out on video, you can bet I'll be right there with my finger on the 'rewind' button.  Ok, the Saddam/Satan thing got a little old, but it did make Saddam look like a real jerk, so it was ok by me.  My favorite part was when Kenny appeared to the kids in the night to give warning of the earth-shattering events to come, and said, 'MMM-MM-MM-MMM-MMM-MMM-M-M!'.  My wife and I just about rolled in the aisles.  The usual South Park 'moral' in this effort was to raise the act of swearing to an absurd plane, and then slaughter it right before our eyes.  Parker and Stone have done it again.",Null,0,0,28 July 1999
The Fifth Element," Well, I loved it.
","I have been disappointed by a great number of shoot-em-up, special effects laden Science Fiction adventure stories but I really loved The Fifth Element.  The story IS simple, but no less imaginable than a bad plot that tries to hide its failings through numerous twists and complications.  I thought Willis was great (as far as Willis-type characters go) and the Zorg character was interestingly portrayed by Oldman.  The Ruby Rod character was so outrageous as to be a perfect foil for Corbin's Gary Cooperisms ('yep', 'nope', 'maybe').  The scenes with the Diva added tons of class to the genre (she even captivates Corbin) and I am going to hunt for records of Ms. Tchako's singing.  Lee-Loo is cuter than a hundred buttons.  Great fun.",Null,0,1,7 April 1999
Ed Wood," a story that needed to be told
","Thank goodness for these 'pet projects'.  As a fan of really BAD cinema, especially '50s Sci-Fi, Ed Wood's movies are right at the top.  Therefore I'm glad to see the story about how a rich medium such as film can be made so horrible in the right hands, and Ed Wood certainly had those hands (Gads, that sounds like a line from one of his scripts!!!).  Depp is marvelous, but it is Martin Landau that showed us the glimpse of TRULY GREAT ACTING, a completely electrifying moment in the archway of an old building.  I have seen Landau make even lesser roles gleam like he did in this movie enough times to prove that great acting is no accident.",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
Fargo," stark realism, the way I like 'em
","Great depiction of how greed and ineptitude can turn a staged crime into a disastrous tragedy.  Well acted and shot, full use is made of the stark, snow filled landscapes of the mid-northern states to the point of surrealism.Maybe the accents were somewhat exaggerated, but the constant use of the 'Jeezes' and 'Yahs' did give a semi-hypnotic effect I'm sure the producers were looking for. It is also very violent, something that happens all too frequently in Paul Bunyan's America.  Frances McDermond was great, and deserves the Oscar she got.  If I can find fault with the movie it is the scene where the 'old friend' tries to con Margie into starting a relationship.  The only possible purpose for such a scene would be to give more depth to the Margie character, but it is mostly distracting.  Some other story device would have been more welcome.Though hard to adjust to at first, I found the musical score to be most haunting and builds brilliantly for dramatic effect where needed.A definite 'thumbs up' from us fans whose tastes lean a little toward the bizzare.",Null,0,0,8 April 1999
The Piano," My wife and I both hated it
","Every character in the movie displays nothing but selfishness from beginning to end.  I saw nothing subtle about locating a story in an isolated place where the men are portrayed as brutal and selfish while the women are portrayed as victimized and selfish.  If there was any 'character' we could empathize with, it was the PIANO itself.  It was the victim of abandonment, neglect and prostitution by brutal and selfish people.This one really stinks.",Null,5,10,14 April 1999
Titanic," Cutting about 1/2 of the contrived romance would've made a great movie
","OK, so there HAS to be a romantic story intertwined to make a real blockbuster.  I like romance, but too much is too much.  If  half the time spent on the romantic fling had gone into historical or technological accuracy or even developing some of the stories of the lives of the hundreds of others aboard, I would no doubt rave that this was the best movie of the year.  But they didn't... and I won't.  It was a good movie that could have been a great movie.  'A Night To Remember' is far better for my vote.",Null,2,3,9 April 1999
The Waterboy," Funny, but not funny enough
","I did laugh out loud... about three times during this boring piece of work. I think I laughed loudest when he takes his GED and his teammate compliments him with, 'All of us know that you are the only one that could have passed that exam!'  Otherwise the weak plot was too reminiscent of 'Happy Gilmore' (a better and funnier movie).  The soundtrack was the best part.",Null,0,2,6 July 1999
