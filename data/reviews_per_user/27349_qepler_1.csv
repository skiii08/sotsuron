The New World," This movie is a total time waste.
","This movie is one the most boredom films i've ever saw.. in fact, when I went to see it I left the cinema after about 30mins because I fell asleep out of boredom. Unless you're a person who gets all this touchy and emotional plus you have iron nerves and patience of steal, take my word on it, don't waste your money and time on this boredom. When I first saw the movie trailers and the kind of hype around it, I went to see it, but never thought it would be that bad. So from I think of this film is that its mostly a film for the review writers and competition such as Oscar etc'... This isn't the kind of movies you go to and when you leave the cinema you say 'wow.', this more of the movies you leave the cinema and say 'damn, did I just waste 2 hours of my time and 5 bucks of my money for this c***?!' Take my word on this, don't spend your money and waste your time for this.",1,4,10,18 March 2006
