Saturday Night Fever," I Don't See Anyone Givin You A Raise Down At Unemployment
","I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the 'Edited For Television' version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.'Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a clich√©. You're no one, going nowhere.' As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his 'station in life' and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak.",10,102,115,5 January 2006
Se7en," It Would Be A Sin To Miss Se7en
","Movies, like music, often help to define the decade in which they originate from. I am 32, so I happen to love a lot of movies from the 80's. Movies like Top Gun, Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire, Die-hard and Lethal Weapon very much define the 80's for me.In my opinion the three most defining movies of the 90's are Pulp Fiction, Silence Of The Lambs and Se7en. Those three movies best capture the mood of the 90's. Smart, dark, cool, gritty and witty. Everything, after all, that the 80's were not (young, dumb and full of cum).I can best describe the movie Se7en as a combination of Taxi Driver and Silence Of The Lambs. It is a close look at the ugly underbelly of society. The people and things we look away from when we pass them by on the streets. More than that, it is a disturbingly close look at the ugliness that we all possess on some level.The plot and screenplay in Se7en are superb. The best there is. The story is simple yet that of genius. A veteran cop (Somerset/Freeman) serving his final 7 days of duty is paired up with a younger cop (Mills/Pitt) who is ready to kick the world in the ass and they are both after a maniacal serial killer who is completing his masterpiece offing 7 victims for 7 deadly sins. Somerset is jaded and cold while Mills is eager and hopefull. A perfect match. Somerset is black and Mills is white. Absolute genius.I can remember being in absolute awe when I first viewed this movie in the theatre. Nothing I'd seen since Taxi driver compared. It's unabashed view of society is unparalleled. Even our two 'heros' aren't terribly admirable. I am actually embarrassed to admit that I understood the serial killers disgust with society during his explanation of his masterpiece to Somerset and Mills. That's not to say I justified his actions. And the casting of the serial killer? Again, absolute genius. Especially because the actor asked that his name not appear in the movie's advertisements or billing.Se7en is not for the faint of heart, but it IS thoroughly enjoyable for fans of cinema. It satisfies on every level.",10,0,0,21 June 2006
Crash," Subtle Hatred
","I read the user comment that accompanies the movies statistics (actors, directors, awards etc.) and the user commented that this was the worst movie ever made and that it handled the subject of racism in a childish manner. The user went on to say that if you'd like to see a 'real' movie about racism than you should see American History X.First of all, American History X is a phenomenal movie. It tackles the subject of racism like no other movie, but I do believe it explores racism at its worst. I think Crash explores the subtle racism that exists on a much more prevalent level. The true hate crimes that are depicted in American History X are horrific, but I believe racism exists in a larger number of people the way it is portrayed in Crash. Racism is based upon fear and ignorance and that is what we see in Crash. People that are afraid and ignorant. Every day people if you ask me.A woman (Bullock's character Jean Cabot) sees two black men walking down the street and she instinctively draws herself closer to her husband. A Lebanese store owner calls a lock smith because his door will not close. The Hispanic lock smith tells the store owner that the problem isn't his lock it's the door. The store owner tells him to 'Just fix it,' and the lock smith informs him that he needs to call someone who sells doors. The store owner insists that he fix it and accuses the lock smith of trying to rip him off because he probably has a friend that sells doors. Does this sound irrational? That's because most of the characters in this movie are, but to me they are real.Most of the characters in Crash are flawed to some degree which makes them even more real. Not only does Crash explore racism amongst several different cultures it also explores how people deal with racism within their own culture. As the movie clearly demonstrates, racism exists in every culture and none of us deal with it intelligently. In Crash a man is accused of not being black enough by his wife. That same man tells another black man that, 'You embarrass me,' because he is living up to many of the stereo types placed upon black people.More than racism I think Crash explores another problem in our society. Our culture has become much more diverse over the years and it would appear that communication between the many different cultures is a HUGE problem. This of course can ultimately lead to racism.",9,0,3,13 July 2006
American Beauty," It's Like I've Been In A Coma For 20 Years And I'm Just Now Waking Up
","Note to self: The next time you see a movie and hate it watch it again. Like Swingers and Sideways I detested this movie upon first viewing. Something drew me back for a second viewing and, ironically, I now watch it every time I need to be cheered up.I can't think of a movie since Ordinary People that captures white upper middle class America as perfectly as American Beauty. In Ordinary People a family is torn apart by a tragedy. A son's death. In American Beauty a family is slowly being torn apart by a different kind of tragedy. Every day life.Lester Burnham is a 42 year old white male who has been completely sedated by the rut of every day life. His wife Carolyn seemingly has everything a person could want, but is totally miserable. Together they have raised one daughter, Jane, who they are clearly out of touch with.What makes this movie work so well for me is how close it is to reality for a lot of people. There seems to be an abundance of people who clearly seem disappointed by life (Lester) or are chasing the next thing that will make them happy (Carolyn). Lester chooses a more dramatic solution to the problem. He quits his job, black mails his former employer, trades his family car in for a Firebird, starts smoking pot with the kid next door and begins to lust after his daughter's best friend, Angela. Carolyn takes her frustrations out by having an affair and blows off steam by going to the shooting range to pop off a few rounds.The tag line for the movie was 'Look Closer' and I couldn't think of a better way to pitch this movie. Upon initial viewing the characters seem typical if not familiar. The movie truly requires multiple viewings to see the depth of the story and the characters.Like a lot of movies that have seemingly basic plots what makes American Beauty rise above the rest is a phenomenal cast. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the roles of the miserably married Lester and Carolyn perfectly. Chris Cooper does a superb job of portraying the ex military gay bashing homosexual neighbor, Col Frank Fits, USMC. A man so disgusted with his own desires that he projects them on to his son, Ricky. No one overacts their roles and all seem to understand the characters they are supposed to be playing. One of those movies that is a 'treat' to watch.I live in Naperville, Illinois. One of the largest suburbs of Chicago and possibly the most white upper middle class community in this country. I find myself driving through neighborhoods looking at gorgeous homes with seemingly happy families thinking, 'There's a lot more going on behind closed doors than people think.' And I do believe that is one of the points American Beauty is trying to make. That and life is what you make of it.",10,2,4,19 June 2006
American History X," Has Anything You've Done Made Your Life Better?
","Asks Bob Sweeney, a former high school teacher of our main character, Derek Vinyard.Derek is a white male who was brought up in a white middle class family and neighborhood. Derek is also the local poster boy for the skinhead white supremacists. Derek is evil personified.At the start of our story we learn that Derek has been convicted of two brutal murders. He has just been released from prison after serving a little more than three years. All of Derek's disciples, including his younger brother, Danny, have been waiting for this day to come. They've been waiting for the return of their hero.Derek has other plans, though. Three years and one prison rape gave Derek enough time and reason to rethink everything he once believed to be true. With the help of his former high school teacher turned mentor, Derek now fully understands the emptiness of his former beliefs. Derek simply wants a second chance at life, but it won't be that easy. Danny worships Derek and is stunned at his change in attitude. Not only will Derek have to remove himself from the life he once lead, he will now also have to remove his brother Danny. A task that proves to be much more difficult than it sounds.Any movie covering the topic of racism is typically difficult to digest, especially when its portrayal is as honest as American History X. As the viewer we get to see it all from the brutal hate crime that landed Derek in jail to the irrational beliefs that fueled his rage. It's not an easy movie to sit through, but well worth it.I have often felt that American History X could be used in high school to educate students about racism. It would take an incredibly talented instructor to tackle the subject using this movie as a tool because many people that harbor racist beliefs depicted in X may view Derek as a hero for all the wrong reasons. I say this because I have personally talked to people who 'like' this movie for all the wrong reasons.X does an excellent job of portraying the pent up anger and frustration of white middle class males that typically leads to these sort of beliefs. Even better, X shows that racism usually starts in the home. Derek adopted his beliefs from his father and were, in his mind, only justified when his father (a fireman) was killed in an all black neighborhood while attempting to do his job.X brings up many social arguments including border control laws and the demographics of prison populations. The movie doesn't attempt to address those issues from a solution standpoint, rather it suggests that if we continue to use examples of societies problems such as these to justify our hate and unhappiness than we are only that much further from becoming happy.The movie is an honest look at an ugly part of our society. I think the movie does a superb job of portraying the story and issues without preaching to the viewer. That being said, it's impossible for an educated viewer not to see the flaws in the views that lead to Derek's hate crime.I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone with the caveat that at times it can be uncomfortable to watch. I'd also add that if you are a fan of Edward Norton his performance was Oscar worthy.",10,0,1,3 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," An Unusual Review
","If I ever have the pleasure of meeting Tom Hanks I probably owe him an apology. Often times a movie will be released and receives so much hype from critics and movie goers that if I don't see it within the first 48 hours of its release I won't see it for quite some time. I'm not sure there is any logical explanation for this. Perhaps I get tired of people quoting and/or talking about the movie. Perhaps I fear that the hype surrounding the movie will only spell disappointment for me as I sit in the theater. For this reason I didn't see Rain Man for at least 10 years after it was released in the theaters. For this reason I will probably never see any of the Austin Powers movies.This has happened to me twice with Tom Hanks and I now own 9 of his movies. I didn't see Forrest Gump for the first time until a year or two ago. The second was The Da Vinci Code which I just finished watching for the first time. Now, this movie is still pretty recent and is actually still considered a new release on DVD. This is one movie I should have seen in the theater for the set pieces alone! I guess this is as good a time as any to mention that I have never read the book and probably never will (sorry Dan Brown). I don't read fiction, which is not to say I don't read. I know that much of the criticism this movie has received is based on how closely it follows the novel.This is an argument that will never end and it's one I don't quite understand. We're talking about two completely different mediums that satisfy and stimulate two completely different parts of our brains. People that whine and complain about how much better a book was than the movie that followed are totally unrealistic. Books have an unlimited amount of time (pages) to discuss the smallest of details. The same people that bemoan movies for not being true to the book from which they were adapted would no more enjoy sitting in a movie theater for 4 hours watching the sincere version of the story that they were hoping to see.All that being said, I think The Da Vinci Code is a superb movie. If you've read the book and seen the movie yet feel the movie was 'lacking' ask yourself this. If you'd never read the book, how would you feel about the movie? How can you not enjoy this movie. I suppose that is the challenge a director like Ron Howard and an actor like Tom Hanks face when making a movie from a book that was so widely read as The Da Vinci Code.There really isn't enough room here to discuss plot points and most of you reading this probably already know the gist anyway. Just know that this is a fantastic thriller. I'm not terribly religious so I had no personal objections to the content. The twists and turns keep you guessing until the very end as quality movies of this kind should.As I said the set pieces are gorgeous. The directing is top notch (the ever reliable Ron Howard rarely disappoints) and the acting is everything you'd hope for and expect from one of our greatest actors, Tom Hanks. I firmly agree with those who compare Hanks to Jimmy Stewart as today's version of the 'every day hero'. Audrey Tautao stands toe to toe with Hanks in the role of Agent Sophie Neveu. This movie is one that I am sure to view several times over the course of the next month trying to soak up all the clues and details that I missed during the first viewing. I'd also read several reviews that stated the movie was too confusing to follow. Not so at all. I had no problems following the movie or understanding what was going on. That being said, there is a lot to take in.I think what confuses me the most about those who are fans of cinema yet did not like this movie is that The Da Vinci Code is a movie fan's movie. It's a thrill ride from start to finish that relies very little on special effects and when they are used they are used very tastefully to help further the advancement of the plot.If you're expecting to be satisfied in the same way you were when you read The Da Vinci Code my advice is to wait for Dan Brown's next novel. If you are in the mood to enjoy a thrilling movie that excites on every level a movie should than The Da Vinci Code is sure to please.",9,0,2,4 January 2007
Halloween," The Original 'Slasher' Flick That Isn't A 'Slasher' Flick
","There are a few movies credited with starting the slasher flick genre. Some claim that it was Psycho. Others feel that The Texas Chainsaw Masacre was responsible for starting one of the most hated film genres of all time. Most would agree that it was the movie Halloween that started it all. Halloween became the template for all of the slasher crap of the 80's. Not until Scream came along in the mid 90's would you see a fresh take on this genre.All that being said, Halloween really ISN'T a slasher flick. Slasher flicks tend to satisfy (or dissatisfy, depending on who you are) the same type of person that prefers a gross out comedy over a more intelligent comedy. Slasher flicks rely on making movie goers squirm in their seats by showing them blood, guts and gore. Something Halloween lacks completely. Director John Carpenter approached the film the same way Hitchcock would have. Less is more. The less you show an audience in a horror film the more scared they are bound to become. Peoples imaginations tend to run wild when they aren't spoon fed all the details. People will walk away from a movie like Halloween thinking they saw things that they really didn't see.The plot of the movie is as simple as it gets. An escaped mental patient (Michael Myers) returns to his home town to continue the killing spree that started with his sister when he was a young boy. Laurie Strode is his main target/obsession (watch Halloween II to find out why).Carpenter succeeds in scaring the living hell out of viewers by dwelling on our most basic fears. Those things that lurk in the shadows. Things that go bump in the night. That house in every neighborhood across America that children warn each other to stay away from (usually because of some false urban legend). For the most part the movie is a ghost story told just as a master story teller would tell it to a group of people sitting around a camp fire.This movie was made to be viewed in the dark and I encourage you to try doing so alone. All of the sudden your own home becomes a bit too spooky. That long dark hallway seems longer and darker. You will undoubtedly hear noises in your home you've never heard before.In addition to top notch directing, John Carpenter also contributed an unforgettably chilling score. As the story goes the movie was originally tested without the score and tested poorly. It wasn't until the addition of Carpenter's basic, yet spooky piano work that audiences felt the full impact of this horror masterpiece.Up until The Blair Witch Project Halloween was the most successful independent movie of all time. Studios didn't believe in it, but movie goers loved it. It's ironic how that works. Studios don't believe in something as powerful as Halloween, but after witnessing its enormous success begin churning out senseless copy cat versions that aren't anywhere near as good.If you haven't seen Halloween, I highly recommend it. That is if you're ready to know what it really feels like to be scared.",10,0,1,29 January 2006
True Romance," Pick Up Some Beer....... And Some Cleaning Products
","Tarantino. With all the Elvis freaks in this world how brilliant is it to write a screenplay where your main character summons The King whenever he needs advice? True Romance is one of those best kept secret type movies. There is no way The Accademy would honor a movie with such gratuitous violence with an Oscar.The best way for me to describe this movie? Whenever I meet a fan of the cinema and we start discussing what we consider to be 'the greats' I get excited, hell I get jittery when I learn that this person HASN'T seen True Romance. Why? Because I remember what it was like viewing this movie for the first time, expecting nothing, yet being totally in awe while watching True Romance for the first time. I get excited because I know that when I insist that THIS be the next movie this person watches, they too will soon be enlightened.While Tarantino should receive credit for knocking out an incredibly original screenplay, it's the cast that makes this movie so special. No one tries to steal the show. No one tries to make it 'their' movie. Believe it or not, there are times in Hollywood when an ensemble cast so special is assembled that the end result truly is magic. This is one of those times.The big scene, of course, occurs between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. A scene that True Romance is known for. But standing toe to toe with these two Hollywood veterans are actors like Bronson Pinchot (yes I said Bronson Pinchot), Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt (responsible for the summary title), Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore and Saul Rubinek.There isn't a dead spot in this flick. It flows perfectly. It's safe to say that most of the characters are unlikeable, yet we love them all.For me to describe the plot would be pointless. It's a waste of time. This is the type of movie where, even though the plot is superior, it doesn't matter because this is a movie made for people who love movies.If you haven't seen True Romance, do yourself a favor and BUY it. I am getting jittery already.",10,1,3,6 January 2006
Goodfellas," I Love Goodfellas More Than The Godfather
","I'm sure I am not the only one on this web site who gets into arguments with their friends about which mob movie is the best. Ultimately it always comes down to The Godfather and Goodfellas. It's like debating over who is better, The Beatles or The Stones? Both are fantastic movies, but offer two different view points on the same subject. I do believe that The Godfather offers a more romantic point of view of the mafia. Perhaps that is because it focuses more on the early years of the mafia. The good years. Goodfellas covers a longer period of time.Including the early 80's when the mafia began to fall apart due to its involvement in drugs.Regardless of whether you prefer The Godfather to Goodfellas there is no denying that Goodfellas is an amazing film. Total perfection. From the directing to the acting to the soundtrack. This movie is flawless.As much as I think The Godfather romanticizes the mafia, when you watch Goodfellas you'll find yourself drawn to the characters and lifestyle depicted in the movie. Goodfellas is THAT powerful. Are these 'good' people? Hell no. But it's all relative. Yes, they are all scumbags, but some are worse than others. When you finish watching Goodfellas, ask yourself this: Are you ticked that it's over? Are you angry that Henry got busted? Do you want to punch the cop in the face when he licks the cocaine off of his fingers smiling at Henry as if to say, 'Busted!'Stellar performances throughout make this a must see for anyone who considers themselves a fan of film. How powerful are these performances? I happen to think De Niro deserved an Oscar simply for the way he smoked a cigarette. The scene where Henry confesses that he knew Jimmy was going to 'whack' Morrie. Sunshine Of Your Love by Cream begins to play as the camera zooms in on Jimmy (De Niro) standing at the end of a bar, smoking a cigarette, pretending to pay attention to someone who is talking to him as he stares off into the distance in anger. THIS is my favorite scene ever captured on film and it lasted less than 30 seconds. This scene is why De Niro is the best living actor. Without saying a word his facial expressions are Oscar worthy.De Niro aside, the movie is loaded with talent. Hell, even Martin Scorsese's mom, Catherine, steals a scene.The plot follows a 'crew' in New York. In the beginning they ruled the neighborhood and ran all the schemes. When it all fell apart 'one of their own' sold them out in court to save his own ass. It's not a movie for the squeamish. The f bomb is dropped constantly and the violence is real and raw.It's been said that when watching The Godfather you almost feel as if you are watching a family's home movies. If that is true, then Goodfellas is like watching the home movies the family didn't want you to see. These are not admirable people. But like I said, Scorsese is so good at what he does, you will be heartbroken when it all ends.",10,0,0,14 February 2006
All the President's Men," A History Lesson
","I was born in 1974, so the events depicted in All The President's Men had just concluded. By the time I was old enough and interested enough to start asking, 'What's Watergate,' more than a decade had passed.I can distinctly remember two events that throughout my schooling my fellow classmates and I were dying to learn more about, yet teachers were far too reluctant, to say the least, to consider discussing. The Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.When asked teachers would often cite a lack of time as the reason why we couldn't discuss these topics. In retrospect my guess is that even 10-15 years after these events had concluded teachers, at least those teaching junior high and high school, were still uncertain as to how to approach these two subjects. They undoubtedly had an opinion and perhaps opinions were still so strong on both issues that administrators and those in charge of curriculum decided a hands off approach was best. For that my fellow students and I made it through high school graduation learning very little about a fascinating very recent slice of American history.It wasn't until 1998 that I learned about a movie about the Watergate scandal called All The President's Men. Surprising to say the least since I am such a huge fan of film. It was the summer of 1998 and my then girlfriend and I were in Washington D.C. visiting some of my relatives. As always, my uncle was the ultimate tour guide. While touring the Library Of Congress he showed us the location of the famous over head shot that is seen in the movie. Once home from vacation I immediately went to the video store and rented All The President's Men. So good it was I actually watched it twice in one sitting.I truly believe that the 1970's is perhaps one of the most interesting decades in our country's history. I can't even really explain why, but I am quite certain that the overall darkness and disappointment that surrounds most of the decade has something to do with my interest in those years. Those ten years were sandwich'd between the artificial self important idealism of the 1960's and the bloated larger than life fat cat life style of the 1980's. For many growing up in the 1970's Watergate was just one example of why they were on a daily basis losing faith in our country.All The President's Men, I believe, captures this event perfectly. The story is told almost totally without any judgment whatsoever. You watch the movie from the reporter's point of view. Their job is to simply gather facts and report them to the public. It's not their job to make judgments. It's their job to present information so that we can make judgments. Of course that is a very idealistic view of the media, but I do believe that is what makes All The Predient's Men so special. We all know how the story ends. The movie is simply a presentation of the events surrounding Watergate and those involved with the scandal.Even today the story holds up and is suspenseful to watch. It's also a sincere glimpse into the day to day workings of a newspaper (at least at that time). There is no effort to glamorize the lives or jobs of Woodward and Bernstein, two working class investigative reporters.What makes All The President's Men so affective to me is the incredibly slow pace at which the tension builds. Especially by today's standards it's a very slow moving movie, but by the end of the movie the tension is nearly unbearable. For over two hours the tension builds and not once does it let up. Again, keeping in mind that we all know how the story ends. That being said, you can genuinely feel the fear that Woodward and Bernstein are experiencing as they unfold one of this country's most devastating political scandals.It's clear that everyone involved in the filming of All The President's Men (Redford, Hoffman, Pakula etc) were committed to giving it their all. It's a joy to watch a political thriller that doesn't seem hellbent on force feeding a point of view down the viewers (deep) throats. Knowing the outcome it's impossible to sympathize with Nixon and presenting the movie that way would have been an injustice, regardless of your political stance.I highly recommend All The President's Men to anyone who is a fan of political thrillers or anyone who is interested in this period of American history. Actually, I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of film because it is one of the best.",10,3,4,6 August 2006
