Mission: Impossible III," big improvement
","when mission impossible 3 was released i was extremely put off going to see it as the second one was so poor, but I'm glad to say this is a big improvement. tom cruise is back in a movie which plot changes so often its hard to give a summary without spoiling anything but lets just say there's some good acting, big explosions,an impossible mission.....(really!) Simon pegg, which all result to give a pretty enjoyable film. once again it doesn't really come close to being as good as the first but to be honest when your watching it thats not really in your mind because on its own its just a really good film that at times proves pretty exciting. this isn't a must see or a must have, in fact its far from but its just some good entertainment that doesn't take a lot deep thought. worth catching though.",7,0,1,21 April 2007
Ghost Rider," the worst film ever made
","ghost rider is simply the worst film ever made. the story follows johnny blaze as he does his deeds for devil whilst juggling the love of his life roxanne, really a simple story storyline but it makes a pretty good job of spoiling what could of been a half decent film. the only thing thats on ghost riders side is that it has some pretty cool special effects and that for once in his life Nicholas cage is at least trying to act , but its not enough to hold this movie together. let me explain why i look so harshly towards this film1.the devils son in the film is totally unconvincing and unscarry 2.the stupid cheesy rock music that comes on every time you see the ghost rider really starts to get on your nerves3.the film seems to come with the promise of an fantastic and exciting climax, but of course there ain't one4.instead of fighting they make fun of each other and just say the stupidest things e.g(when the devils son is holding the ghost rider down he says ' try and get it into that thick skull of yours)ha ha comical geneuise5. each character appears to be incredibly stupid and it just becomes annoying6. this piece of craps over an hour longreally i must implore you not to watch this film to will totally regret paying the admission fee, wasting good money to buy the DVD pr allowing it to waste an hour and a half of your life that you may never reclaim.ghost rider simply leaves you with the felling of regret and sorrow that for one moment you thought it may be good, its a really big disappointment and a step backwards for the comic book adaptions",1,4,11,10 April 2007
World Trade Center," world trade center
","this is most most disgracefull movie ever made. i am appoled that the American studios think this is the right way to commemorate the September 11 disaster, by getting nicholas cage to put on a fake moustache and pretend hes some kind of hero when the only reason he is in this film is to make a bit of money. Shall i tell you the truth , this is American shite and proof that America what these disasters to happen so they came make millions on the so called heart breaking films about them. if you are American and think you have to see this movie, think again, if you go to see this you are as well spitting on the graves of those who died that day because this movie is not 'a tale of courage' its a tale of thousands dieing because of the war, which America is to blame for. its just sickening to watch this, not because it breaks your heart but because you know oliver stone is sitting at home fluffing his pillows and smoking cigar's with the money you give him to make a movie that laughs in the faces of the terrorists saying ' you giving destroy anything we have and well still make money out of it ' so don't fear viewers because as soon as they do it again nicholas cage will be round the corner to save the day with another Hollywood blockbuster. god bless American",1,9,18,27 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," the Da vinci code
","the Da vinci code by Dan brown was an interesting and fast paced book, but I'm afraid the movie does not live up to it.the movie is let down by consistent poor acting a lack of explaining that for viewers who haven't read the book will be confused by. Ron Howard has made two big mistake in making this film, he has rushed the last half hour of the film and giving it a pure American ending. these things let the movie down but it's a good story and worth a watch. i decided to read the book before i saw the movie and it definitely changed the way i saw the movie so it's probably better to have not read the book when watching the movie ' but if given the choice read the book and forget the movie . if you go to see it don't expect a masterpiece",5,0,1,12 July 2006
