Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Utterly rubbish in every way.
","Unfortunatley it took me a long time to realise that Espisode I: The Phantom Menace was poor, poor beyong all imaginable parameters.I still hav e trouble accepting just how bad it really is.
i owe a lot to George Lucas, he provided me with 3 superb films that allowed me to wonder and imagine at the world as I grew up.  Indeed, Star Wars-released a year before I was born-was a film I watched every day for 2 years(according to my parents)What I can't understand is how someone with such vision and ability has created something with no discernable heart, soul, emotion or cohesiveness.I can't imagine why Rick McCallum was allowed to oversea such a mishmash of stilted, mishmassed, children orientated rubbish.  The appeal of the original trilogy is that it appealed across the ages, wheras this celluloid is merely a mis-matched collection of graphics against live action footage, and sadly the much heralded CGI graphics will look ropey in 10 years time.Jar-Jar Binks was apparantly added as a nod to kids, but who cares when the whole film is aimed at children from 5-11.  Binks is embarrassing, crude, and even the live actors can manage to meet eye contact.The sad thing is that I STILL try to watch this film in an attempt to make it appeal to me.  It does not happen.  Darth Maul was the only redeeming feature, yet he is already dead.One sadly must put the blame at the door of George Lucas.  He arrogantly expects people to wait 20+ years for follow up masterpieces, yet glaringly fails to deliver.  I thought the man was a genius, yet he actually appears to be the first Direstor/Creator/Whatever who wants to replace actors with CGI, thus undermining what all his previous efforts were built upon.I can only hope for improvement with Episode II: Attack of the Clones, but somehow, with so much to be drawn from it(the Mandalorian Battles/Clone wars, Padme/Anakin angles, MAce Windu, etc, etc) I don't think so.  Even Ewoks were more palatable to thisMaybe I'm wrong.  Prove me wrong.  Don't ever make me cringe watching any STAR WARS.",2,0,1,3 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A vast imporovement on the turgid kiddie flick EPISODE I
","I really got into this film, despite its almost 3 hour length. Similarily with Episode 5, The Empire Strikes Back, this film bridges the storyline of a trilogy, oozing a darker, edgier tone.Lucas clearly has woken up to the fact that the majority of SW fans are not kids(even if they were first time around) and thus do not want a kids' film.  The action and violence are increased accordingly, and all that remains id for Jar-Jar to be brutally murdered in Episode III.Wonderful ending sequence, lasts upwards of 20 minutes , and this definately makes the film stand out. The dialogue still sucks to high hell sadly.  Lucas sadly has not let his betters take care of this area, ignoring Harrison Fords advice of 25 years ago.Overall I would recommend this film.",8,0,0,22 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Look, the guy who says this fillm lacks credibility is wrong
","If you actually read the book by Robert Ludlum, enjoy it, then take a step back from it consider two things.1) Thia book was written years ago, in 19802)Carlos Ilyich Ramirez, aka Carlos the Jackal - was still at large in 1980.  He is not now, as he was jailed by French Authorities, once again, many years ago.You cannot take a theme that was resolved in real life and superimpose it into fiction and expect your audience to respect the work.  As Carlos was the central theme of all three books(The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum-all excellent by the way), it is both painfully obvious and decididly necessary to change the central theme of the film to reflect the secondary theme of the book, IE what National Secrets could this Rogue Agent/CIA Assasin impart to the wrong people/Government if coersed, bribed or whatever.My opinion is aside from the obvious and necessary meandering from the Carlos angle, the film is a decent and effective attempt at bringing the thrust of Bournes struggle to find who and what he is, whilst avoiding shadowy hitmen at every juncture.You simply cannot take a 500-600 page book written in 1980(as a techno/espionage thriller), leave it entirely intact and have it still appeal to a mass market.I went into this movie with an open mind, as I usually do, and whilst I would have liked to see more depth to Clive Owens and the other assains characters, and more explaination behind the purpose of 'Treadstone 71', I feel this is still a movie to enjoy, so I recommend you give it a shot.",8,2,2,26 January 2003
The Thing," Classic film, suspense just creeps out of the cold..
","I think this film is a remake of a 1950's classic, but can't find the relevant reference.   As it is, John Carpenter turns in a masterful effort of chilling, riveting cinema, that still roots me to my seat after countless viewings.  He even does the soundtrack which ably compliments the feeling of claustraphobia the Antartic Survey team feel at finding an intruder amongst their midst.. Recommended viewing for any film-goer who likes to be gripped to the edge of their seat.",9,0,1,30 September 2002
Gladiator," A great action movie, but underneath a powerful story..
","The film is well made, well acted and a fantastically fluid yarn. I have seen this film over ten times, yet still feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and discomfort after doing so.That is why I cannot consolidate or agree with lines like 'edge of your seat fun'.  Lets face it, the guys son is murdered, his wife is raped and butchered, both are burned.  The hero gives up a life of comfort as a General in the Legion over his principles and beliefs, and this is how he is repayed?Almost everyone in the film end up dead, there are long scenes of dreamscapes and wind rushed grass, yet still I find myself drawn to this story.Whether its Crowes masterful performance(aided ably by a skilled cast), or Scott's knowing direction, the film strikes me as a classic-now, and for years to come, albeit a depressive one.MCR",8,0,0,16 November 2001
