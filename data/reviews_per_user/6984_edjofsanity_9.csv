The Equalizer," Nothing new to see here...
","Denzel stars as a man with a hidden past that includes many specialized and dangerous skills. The prostitute he befriends is beaten up by the Russian mob. All he really wanted to do was to encourage her to read classic literature, instead he's ready to take down the mob single-handed. It really seemed like the movie was supposed to star Liam Neesom (might of been better too). Same story as hundreds of other movies, just ramp up the violence. Same Denzel: how many times do we have to see him squint his eyes and look with serious hatred, then suck on his bottom lip. It was great in Glory, but come on man, learn some new facial and vocal expressions already. He is the same in every movie. Which only made this worse. I suppose it's a decent action movie for a matinée or a rental, just don't make it your first choice.",5,12,23,30 September 2014
It," Meh...
","I saw the new 'It' today. I read the book years ago. I also saw the made for TV miniseries. While this movie was not bad, it certainly was not very entertaining either. The story is a balance between the experience the children have in defeating evil and what happens 27 years later when the evil comes back and they have to decide if they will fight it again as adults. Some of the best parts of the story are derived from comparing the characters in their childhood years to their adult years. This movie had none of that. It only dealt with the children, obviously banking on a second feature. Because of this, all the charm of the movie was lost. It felt like a second rate 'Stranger Things.' Even the made for TV version was better. I am so glad I only paid matinée price, but even that was too much. The best part of this movie was the clown, Pennywise. Very creepy but not good enough to save this feature. Wait for video.",5,10,19,12 September 2017
Ex Machina," Good movie.
","Great acting. Great script. Great special effects. Great story. After watching the trailer a few times I thought I knew what the twist would be, and I was surprised to find out that I was wrong. Also, the actors are so good that they make the 'rich playboy scientist creates the world's first AI' story believable. But the pacing was just too slow for me. I even went in to the movie expecting it to be a more cerebral experience. Still, the movie dragged on. It seemed like they were repeating scenes just so they could keep the ominous mood throughout. I enjoyed it, and chances are good that you will too, but I won't be watching it a second time.",6,2,6,19 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Done Right
","I thoroughly enjoyed Episode IV, loved Episode V, thought that Episode VI was enjoyable but too 'kiddy.' I consider episodes I, II, III worthy distractions at best. With the announcement of Episode VII a flicker of hope began to burn. Could JJ and Disney re-ignite what has been considered a world-wide cultural phenomena? Could new characters be introduced that engaged our hearts with emotion and excitement as Luke, Leia, Han, Chewy, Darth and the Droids did? I am writing this to tell you THE FIRE HAS BEEN RE-IGNITED! The Force Awakens has managed to re- kindle the fire of Star Wars. The new characters draw the viewer in and make you care about what happens to them (something Ep. 1-3 failed to do). The connection to the familiar old characters didn't feel forced and made it fun. I can't wait to see Episode VIII! I need to see it! I did not think I would feel that way about Star Wars again. V and V are still my favs, but VII has proved to be the awakening we've been looking for.",8,6,17,20 December 2015
Spectre," Spectre is little more than a shadow of good 007.
","I love James Bond. I love Daniel Craig as 007. This movie was neither the best or worst of that team up and left me wishing it was better. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were great; the casting superb; the story and writing were even well thought out. What wasn't thought out were the scenes in-between the action. No character or plotdevelopment - just boring. The audience was not engaged in the story. The movie dragged on and on. I welcomed the ending in stead of wanting more. That is not a good place to be for such a solid franchise. Hopefully the next installment will have more substance than a spectre.",8,2,6,9 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Delivers exactly what was promised!
","I loved all the trailers for this movie. In fact, they were so good I was beginning to suspect that the actual film was going to sub-par. Boy was I wrong. This movie hit every button promised in the trailer. Stunts, over the top action, choreographed car chases and a small but engaging story line. (Let's face it, if you were going for a heart- wrenching, deeply moving story about a misunderstood man ------THIS AIN'T IT!) This is cars, Max, cars, Furiosa, cars, explosions, women who can stand up to bad men, cars and a killer storm thrown in. Even Mel Gibson would be approving this upgrade. While it is rated R, it's on the tame side of R. And that DOES NOT mean you can take your kids. It's still R. Be the responsible parent and enjoy this with your friends now, with your kids when they are 18. I plan on seeing it a second time with some more friends.",8,3,10,19 May 2015
13 Hours," Fantastic movie about a troubling incident.
",I was worried when I saw Michael Bay's name attached to this movie. One thing this story did not need was his tendency to glamorize and pontificate. After seeing this movie I can honestly say that I'm glad he was in charge. The directing helped the viewer to identify with what the soldiers were dealing with: not knowing what locals to trust; trying to obey superiors but wanting to save American lives. John Krasinski does a great job as soldier who is realizing the importance of his family. His underrated performance brings the heart to this movie. I was also worried that Bay would turn this story into some political message - he did not. This movie was about the soldiers' dilemma and how they saved American lives.,9,7,15,26 January 2016
The Martian," The Martian Has Landed
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie going in. Matt Damon is pretty hit and miss for me and I was afraid of a preachy message from Scott (like so many sci-fi movies do). To my great surprise I, I loved this movie! The story was compelling, the characters believable and the 'leave no man behind' message is very positive. Matt Damon's performance shines and watching him deal with overwhelming problems is enough to inspire anyone to not give up. Of course much of the science was not believable - it's a movie - but as a story element it all worked terrifically. I recommended this movie for everyone teen and above. It has some language issues (so would I if I was left struggling alone on Mars). This movie just topped my list for 2015.",9,3,9,7 October 2015
Furious 7," Screen Action Saves the Day
",The gang's seventh installment gives you all the action and fast cars that you have come to expect from the franchise. The fact that you have to leave half your IQ at the door should come as no surprise either.The script and plot had me wincing in my seat on several occasions but I decided to wait and see if the action sequences would make up for it...again. They did (barely). Here's an idea: reserve .01% of the money used on cgi and put it towards a decent screenwriter and story collaborator. I think everyone who likes fast cars and/or a good action thriller should be insulted at how stupid the producers of this movie think we are. End on a positive note: loved the Paul Walker farewell.,6,0,12,8 April 2015
