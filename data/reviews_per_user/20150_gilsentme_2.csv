Hereditary," Good set up, slightly silly denouement
","Hereditary demonstrates considerable skill in how it sets up an unsettling tale about a family enduring a devastating loss and what dark forces may be behind this. The family members are presented as idiosyncratic, representing different perspectives, but all of whom are sympathetic in their own ways and not yielding to simple stereotypes. The difficulties behind the events in their lives unfold slowly and eerily, director Ari Aster pacing the film expertly. As a result, we have a film that has a very strong and convincing first two thirds but alas loses its way in the final third when everything suddenly becomes somewhat generic and echoing the melodramatic moments of horror cinema's greatest hits.",8,0,0,15 March 2020
The Witch," Unnerving, compelling but afraid to embrace ambiguity (thematic spoilers)
","An unnerving piece, focusing in on self-imposed isolation emerging from a desire to be doctrinally pure. The film ostensibly builds on how a family, moving themselves away from the Pilgrim community with whom they entered the New World at the behest of a devout and driven father, begin to develop paranoid notions regarding their fate, both related to their abandonment by God and the influence of darker forces. The pacing of all this is done incredibly well and the acting compelling, especially the younger actors, who I feared were verging on being traumatised such was their commitment. If anything, the ending let's the building tension down little, giving as it does an unequivocal answer to the central concerns being presented throughout. I did wonder if leaving everything ambiguous might have been a bolder approach. As it is, arguably what is presented as explanation lets certain family members' perspectives off the hook somewhat.",8,1,3,15 March 2020
