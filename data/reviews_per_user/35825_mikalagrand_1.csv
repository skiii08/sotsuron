First Man," Missed Potential
","Yes it's interesting to show the family side, but I found this movie really boring. Eventhough it was one of the most exciting moments in history. They should have shown more about the spacerace and the tensions with the USSR. There was also nothing about how Armstrong was enthusiastic about flying from an early age. Also when his daughter died, I didn't even know who she was; there should have been more time establishing the family and the character motivations at the beginning. Armstrong's wife also seemed like she was only annoyed with him.",5,0,0,25 April 2019
