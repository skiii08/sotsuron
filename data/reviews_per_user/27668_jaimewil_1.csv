Lucky Number Slevin," This movie felt like The Usual Suspects with a love interest. Good things come in 3s (err 4s)!
","This film is well worth heading into your nearest theater instead of waiting a few months for it on DVD.I went to a matin√©e Tuesday to an empty theater, well one other soul entered as the nearly endless reel of commercials and theater ads and upcoming trailers concluded.I was thoroughly please with the film and the 'perfect' center seating. The soundtrack selections were nice and further added to this film.Good things come in 3s and 4s and slevins. Go see this film.Director Paul McGuigan did an excellent job following up his work on 2004's 'Wicker Park.' Good to see writer Jason Smilovic has advanced to film following the TV series 'Karen Sisco' My rating is actually 8.5/10 though I choose not to round up until I am able to track down the soundtrack.",8,2,9,13 April 2006
