Skyfall," Excellent movie from start to finish
","Absolutely Loved the movie. Everything about it was awesome from the opening chase to the shoot out at the end. It would be great to see some Oscar nods, especially for the cinematography and the song during the opening credits. Hoping they can get Mendes/Deakins back for another one because you can tell right from the start that this a much higher caliber Bond film than we have gotten for decades. What a way to bring Bond back after a 4 year absence. I am such a happy movie goer. I cant remember the last time i enjoyed a movie this much. If there is anyone that has any doubts about this movie, let me put them to rest. Already looking forward to the next one. Happy 50th anniversary Mr. Bond!!!",10,6,18,11 November 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Just couldn't follow it
","I couldn't follow this any better than I could the Hurt Locker. It was way too slow and long and the conversations/meetings were too hard to understand who and what they were talking about.(I even had subtitles turned on) Wish it had made more sense, but unfortunately, it didn't. What is zero dark thirty supposed to represent? Anyway, I am sure there are plenty of fans of this movie out there. But I am not one of them and this movie wasn't for me. Hoping for a better offering from Kathryn Bigelow in the future after not understanding her last two films. Would like to see something that's more to the point and adrenaline pumping like an 80's movie like Point Break, which had a simple story.",1,11,23,23 March 2013
Inception," The most confusing movie I have ever seen.
","Why does this movie have such a high rating? I do not get it or the movie itself, for that matter. It just do not make any sense to me. When I saw this movie, I walked out of the theatre feeling so confused and having mixed feelings of unhappiness for the most part and parts of happiness for the parts I liked, which were the ones with special effects. My wife loved this movie, I did not. I tried to really watch close and pay attention, but I still didn't get it. At all. Sorry for the low rating, everybody else seems to love this movie. Oh well, I can't say the same thing if I don't understand what was happening. Anyone who wants to offer an explanation can feel free to explain. I will welcome any explanation offered. Maybe I will enjoy the movie more the next time I watch it. I hope to get to watch it again soon. That would be good.",Null,3,8,21 November 2011
