The New World," Vague, confused mess
","It's bad enough we slaughtered them, riddled them with disease and scattered their tribes. Mr. Malich has now exploited them with this impressionistic music-video in the guise of a feature epic. Colin Farrell seems truly intoxicated throughout. Christian Bale is an uncharacteristic drip. Christopher Plummer seems to be gliding around like St. Peter on a winged chariot. David Thewlis wastes his talents on a cheesy cameo. But the nature pictures and the soundtrack were so very, very pretty. They garnered my 5 vote. Why, after all these decades, can't a decent historical film be made from good solid research and decent scripting?",5,1,4,18 August 2006
Requiem for a Dream," My sober opinion.
","This film left me absolutely drugged. I have waited for a week to write down my comments. I am beyond detox and now in recovery. I have worked as a nurse in detox centers. I have had significant relationships in my private life with alcoholics, speed addicts, marijuana addicts and heroin addicts. And, I know that this film taught me a powerful and direct lesson about how addiction feels to the addict. I was stunned by the film makers' abilities to convey the feeling of gradual distortion and loss of control, caused by chemical addiction. It was a very harrowing ride. This film (probably more than any other I have seen recently) blurs the boundary between representation of experience and experience itself. Very powerful. Very talented cast of consistent and compatible skill. Well written and well directed screenplay. Exquisitely integrated and affective use of sound and visual effects. A cut diamond with very sharp edges.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
Meet the Parents," Does funny mean stupid?
","I enjoyed this film. DeNiro, Stiller, Danner, all were quite funny in working with the screenplay. I just had to wonder, though, during that really slow part near the end, why American comedies tend toward making their characters seem incredibly shallow and stupid. The more shallow and stupid these characters seemed, the less funny the film became. Direct correlation in my opinion.",7,0,0,1 November 2000
The Other Boleyn Girl," One for the chopping block.
","Another venture into Tudor History Lite. This film has gone the way of the recent HBO miniseries on the Tudors. I admit the Tudor family, with the exception of Elizabeth I, were the B-movie equivalent of English royals, but this film poorly modernizes their lack of sensibility and desperation to build a dynasty on very shaky hereditary ground. The conflicts all seem equivalent to Silicon Valley mergers. Dry, scrubbed clean, and dressed with cable-TV sex scenes. The movie's on-screen talent is immense. I have never seen Natalie Portman acting so badly, so over the top. I have to surmise this was the director's bidding. And what was happening with Mark Rylance's beards? I think that make up person might end up in The Tower. The whole production reminded me of the history pictures of the 1940s and 1950s. However, those beloved old films were great camp and did not take themselves as seriously as this misguided attempt.",6,1,2,16 June 2008
Billy Elliot," What a film!
","This film is about Liberation in the most fundamental sense. The story of one proletarian boy's struggle to just begin to develop amazing natural gifts is brilliantly told. The viewer is shown the objective and subjective (verging on production numbers) realities of a conflicted and dominated child with seamless grace. Amazingly, the film deals with BIG issues very effectively by using the various vignettes in Billy's life. We are allowed to see things through the less cluttered child's eyes. Jamie Bell is himself a talented boy and simply IS the title role. Julie Walters, whom I will always see as the uneducated Rita, was a natural for her role. Gary Lewis, as the collier dad,  was able to keep his potentially dastardly character from being a bad guy. Jamie Draven, as Billy's much older brother, captured the conflicts in his relationships extremely well. For me, Jean Heywood's farewell to Billy was a crystal revelation of what this Elliot family was all about. I cried, as I always do when a film captures the emotional fullness of a subject. The film is about class. The film is about talent. The film is about the unscarred beauty of youth. The film is about the victory of honesty and love. So, go see it and bring a handkerchief.",10,1,1,13 October 2000
Troy," Not even Homer lite
","The Iliad was not all about Achilles. But this movie is all about Brad Pitt. I am a big fan of Mr. Pitt for many reasons. However, I am a much more avid fan of Homer, whose Iliad has been massacred by this 1950s epic with 21st Century special effects. The sacking of Troy cannot compare to the devastation wrought on Homer's epic poem by this production. 'Lord of the Rings' received far better treatment on all levels. Brian Cox plays Agamemnon with Vaudevillian villainy. Brendon Gleeson takes a better stab at Menelaus, but it is not his finest hour. Orlando Bloom's Paris is prettier than Helen of Troy. And bless the memory of Peter O'Toole, who, despite age and infirmity, gave this movie its only dose of class. In fairness, I should also credit Sean Bean with a somewhat respectable Odysseus. The staged beefcake shots were calendar worthy, I suppose, but even the passion seemed canned and stale. My vote of 6 goes to all the crew and post production folks who did a great job on the look of the film, with the exception of the really bad hair extensions. Why can't someone have the guts and vision to do the Classics with intelligence and respect for both the original brilliance of the stories and the intelligence of an audience? The Iliad could have been done much better with less flash.",6,0,1,13 March 2005
Snatch," Gritty and very funny.
","This finger snapping, episodic comedy is very well done. Lots of graphic violence and a total dearth of P.C. hypersensitivity punctuate an intelligent, albeit cynical, screenplay. I was particularly impressed with its use of real Brit pleb-speak without subtitles. (Three American 20 somethings behind me were left utterly and amusingly clueless.) I enjoyed watching Dennis Farina in a character part that was perfectly suited to him. Brad Pitt's gypsy was great, and suitably folded into the story to mute his superstar/superhunk appeal. There were too many great characters to name, but Alan Ford, as Brick Top, had that remarkably funny and sadistic edge of Hopkins as Hannibal. Likable henchmen, a squeaking pit bull, no silly romantic subplots, and fast pacing make this a fast and giddy ride through the seedy side of the UK. A great film to see in a large audience. Lots of raucous laughter.",9,0,0,3 February 2001
The Beach," DiCaprio's celebrity overshadows.
","DiCaprio fever seems to have obscured the worth of this film on its own merits. His celebrity seems to have overshadowed and killed serious criticism of this film, I believe. If 'Lord of the Flies' is seen as a reference, I think a case can be made that this film makes some very powerful and effective statements about classic Utopianism among the children of the jaded and bored richer classes. DiCaprio plays his spoiled American very well. The young man is a great actor. The role of Tilda Swinton is well written, but I think she made her character too intelligent and complex with her excellent, but intense, acting. The jockish and superficial tribe members were much more convincing. I loved the international casting. The cast and the setting are visual knock outs. Robert Carlyle brought his 'Trainspotting' insanity to the film, but I think his character was written over the top. Paterson Joseph, as Keaty, was a stand out. Guillame Canet, as Etienne, worked well as the tortured cast off in his particular love triangle. It took two viewings of this film for me to see past its stunning visuals and over-the-top highs and lows to appreciate it for its intelligent themes. If you disliked it the first time, you might give it another try.",8,0,0,20 March 2001
Closer," The play plays well.
","The twists and turns of coincidence and rivalry are Shakespearean. The acting is superb. The cast is an intriguing mixture of British masculinity and American femininity. As the final credits turned, I was stunned at my own lack of awareness during the film that it was indeed a cast of four, performing a well written play, based in excellent dialog. The play indeed plays well in the movie. I was particularly entertained by the unusual nature of parts played by Natalie Portman and Jude Law. She uncharacteristically plays a sex worker of sorts. He uncharacteristically plays a neurotic underachiever. Their chemistry and dissonance is well done. And who doesn't like to watch Julia Roberts and/or Clive Owen being sexually tortured and/or torturing? Something for everyone there. My only negative criticism is that some of the plot devices bringing them all together seemed a bit arcane, despite being gussied up in sexy gear.",8,0,0,3 December 2005
Gone Baby Gone," A for mood, C for message.
","As a Bostonian, I am always interested in seeing a shared view of my native area. The Affleck view in this film is very familiar to me. I am delighted that somebody has shown the other textures of the greater Boston community. I grew up in the Boston portrayed in the film. Rough working class neighborhoods. No John Adams in sight there. So, Ben, you get an A for the feel of the film.The plot and the cast are other matters entirely. The convoluted story would probably read well, but the continuity in the film is poor at times. Casey Affleck simply cannot do stoic without looking over-medicated. He's attractive and likable, but he's no Harrison Ford. The pivotal role of the hostile uncle of the missing child is played by Titus Welliver. The portrayal is a major flaw in the movie. He's just bad, as in smoked pork product.Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman add weight but are very out of place. They simply are too good for the rest of the cast. Amy Ryan is excellent as the South Boston-Dorchester single mom. She captured the essential persona of doper and narcissistic MTV-generation airhead. Amy Madigan is also quite good and believable in her small role.Uneven and anticlimactic throughout, yet better than watching TV.",7,1,6,17 April 2008
The Aviator," Biopic or testimonial?
","This Scorsese-DiCaprio epic is a visual and audible feast. All the media blitzing seems warranted from the perspective of bang for your movie bucks. The special effects are thrilling. The camera work is hypnotizing. The shots are suitably grand or movingly intimate. And, the viewer is guaranteed 170 minutes of semi-solid entertainment. I cringed at the initial sound of Cate's Kate, but I was won over very quickly. I winced at the first sight of Beckinsale's Gardner, but I was soon reassured by her delivery of Ava-speak, frank and earthy. Mr DiCaprio's representation of Hughes was less problematic, since the recluse Hughes left a relatively forgotten audio-visual legacy. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda were really quite good. Alda's Senator Brewster rivals Charles Laughton's Senator Cooley in Preminger's 'Advise and Consent' (1962).But, is it biopic or testimonial? And, as either or both, is the film a well constructed and coherent piece of work? The exploration of Howard Hughes' eccentricities certainly is coherently and cogently done. This is no mean feat. The man lived a relatively long and very eventful life, despite crippling personality traits. The political material late in the film did seem more testimonial than biopic. I felt I was fairly warned by the earlier scene, in which Hughes scolds the rich socialists at the Hepburn table in Connecticut. In any case, I think it fair to summarize one of the movie's underlying prejudices as 'Unrestrained capitalism is good.' It is indeed a timely message. However, I wonder if this timely viewpoint will stand the test of time and art.",7,1,3,20 February 2005
American Psycho," Movie or audience?
","I think 'American Psycho' will succeed because repeat viewers will go to the film to watch premier viewers for their reactions to the shocks, ranging from loud and clear racism, sexism, homophobia and oozing violence. This is a phenomenon familiar to fans of the 'Halloween' genre. My showing began with a young 20-something couple walking out after the characters made some nasty remarks about a Jewish colleague. (Later, I was happy for them. They might have needed resuscitation if they had stayed.)Actually, after observing the many under-30's at the showing I attended, I understood that the dark humor about 1980's Manhattan was wasted on them. They seemed to react to the graphic violence, but they did not laugh at all. Perhaps these times are too similar for them to those in the film?I lived in Manhattan during the period of the movie. I was frequently embarrassed by my own lonely laughter during the film. I was getting Ted Bundy looks myself after a while. It was worth the humiliation. I really did enjoy most of it.As a film, however, it seemed to get sloppy at its end. Without revealing any details, I would say that the film seemed to lose it edgy pace and meticulous style in its last ten or fifteen minutes. I will recommend the film very carefully to certain friends.",7,0,0,21 April 2000
Beasts of No Nation," Refreshing window on Africa.
","As an American I was pleased to see this ground-level view of the conflicts in Africa of the last 25 years. I applaud Netflix for adopting the film as one of its own. I have followed these conflicts in international news. I have known immigrants here in the U.S. who were displaced by these conflicts.The film is a bit generic. By that I mean it has the super-realism of bloody violence but maintains the feel of a stage play. Scenes tend toward tableau rather than a blend of related events as they might occur. This is fine, but felt like a buffer between me as a viewer and the horrors portrayed. The perversion of children by poverty and violence is very well represented. Agu, the central character, conveys the process of descent into hell from a nurtured and deceptively secure childhood. I think the film could have contained more inner-voice commentary on his experiences. His voiced thoughts were very compelling. I was most impressed by the end of the film. The straight forward portrayal of his trauma while in a refuge for child warriors was stunning. This brought the film back out of the typical genre of war movies into the realm of psychological drama. Abraham Attah's performance was most impressive in these scenes.",8,3,4,8 January 2016
The Illusionist," Intelligent suspense.
","This wonderful story is brought to life by a very good cast. The story itself is loosely based in the real-life mystery of Crown Prince Rudolf's suicide, which rocked the Austrian Hapsburgs in 1889. He was thirty-one. His suicide followed the violent death of his female lover, Baroness Vetsera. There is ongoing debate as to whether he murdered her and then committed suicide, or whether they were engaged in a suicide pact, in response to an edict from Rudolph's father, Franz Josef, the Austrian Emporer. It has been called the Mayerling Affair, named for the hunting lodge where the couple had their assignations. The use of real history and its reshaping into an engaging mystery which parallels the real mystery is what is ingenious about the script. Edward Norton is excellent. Perhaps the taciturn nature of his character enhanced his performance. Jessica Biel is also very good as the Countess. Paul Giamatti puts in another great performance as the police inspector. The only thing that bothered me was the sepia palette of the film. While it contributed to the credibility of the illusions, it was a bit too brown and dark at times, when contrasted to the scenes which were brightly lighted. A minor complaint. The sets were delightful. I could feel the heat from the real gas lights. Overall, this is one of the best period mystery-suspense films I have seen.",9,1,1,18 March 2007
Pi," Quirky?
","Jim Jarmusch famously resents having his films referred to as 'quirky' by critics. Yet, it seems to me that many independent films, including 'Pi', have little else going for them. Perhaps the development of rich dramatic films by independent producers has spoiled me or corrupted me. Didn't David Lynch do all this stuff in 'Eraserhead' in 1977? Black and white, crooked cameras, troubled close ups, vague and humorless dialogue. Come on. I can understand how the new generation of math obsessed computerites can relate to the hero's psychosis over formulas, but I thought it was boring and very 'done'.",6,3,4,18 March 2001
8 Mile," Wiggerdom 101
","I took to watching this film like I take to swallowing pink antacid. I had been subjected to the music, of course, since I live in a major city where unrestrained car stereos blast all sorts of monotonous dribble. I was most resistant to experiencing the culture of trailer trash sensation, Eminem. Since I am what Eminem would call a 'faggot', I feel that I must speak on his level when commenting on his art. It is art. I recognize the artfulness in it all: His lyrics, his film, his persona. I also recognize the cold blooded nature of the culture he promotes and glorifies. I would conjecture that some black men might also protest about this portrayal of black male culture. Yet, I also know that this wigger world view is out there in America. So, I have to admit that the film served an educational function for me. It was akin to watching one of the many films about Nazis or the KKK. I also know now to avoid wiggers and their kin, since they seem committed to a culture of violence and intolerance. The intolerance is the most base kind, since its chief targets are education, achievement and good manners.",6,0,1,18 February 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Expunged Intelligence
","Who are you? I felt like the Blue Caterpillar as I watched this movie, without benefit of the water pipe. This production has flattened the intelligence of the original story and turned it into boilerplate Disney. Sad. No Dodo dialog. No Walrus. No Tweedle-Dumb-Dee repartee. No discernible March-Hare riddles. A vaudeville shadow of its source. Perhaps the American psyche is getting stupid because the diet offered up by its media is lacking in proper nutrients. Johnny Depp needs to let go of his zany thing for a while. I admire his talent, but this aspect of his repertoire is getting stale. Helen Bonham Carter and Stephen Fry (Cheshire's voice) steal the show.",5,2,5,5 November 2010
The Last Samurai," It wasn't really about eye candy.
","'The Last Samurai' (good riddance) is a Japanese Western along the lines of the Japanese samurai genre of the 1930s-1950s. Its visual scale is comparable to the late Kirusawa epics, but its content is a derivative hash of American Westerns and Clavell's 'Shogun'. The most laudable feature of the film is its cinematography. For those of us who admire antique Japanese design, the eye candy is very nice. But the end of the samurai culture was not about eye candy. I think the film misses this point entirely. It also was not about rugged (American) individualism fighting against corporate corruption. These are American stories which could be told again these days. The ending of the samurai culture was akin to the current turmoil in the (Saudi) Arab world. Samurai were xenophobic feudal creatures like Usama Bin Ladin, confronted by an Industrial Age, championed by an emperor who received a modern education for his time. The Hollywood propensity for making everything black-and-white from an antique American (cowboy's) moral viewpoint poisoned what could have been a wonderful film about the complexity of progress and human evolution.",6,1,3,19 September 2005
The Hurricane," I thought I wouldn't like it.
","I saw this film recently on cable. I had missed it in the theaters on purpose. I was turned off by some of the selling of the film I had heard on talk radio. So, when the first twenty minutes seemed to forecast the fairly predictable 'it's just the way white people alway abuse us' theme, I grabbed the remote control. I did not click. I was held by Denzel Washington's riveting superstar thing. He's just got it. What can I say? I was rewarded. The film evolved into one of the best mind benders I have seen about race relations. I like that a lot. There were no bad groups or good groups by the end of the film. Just very real individual people, responsible and irresponsible, lovable and hateful, hopeful and defeated. I really enjoyed Liev Schreiber in this film. Also, isn't Rod Steiger always a welcomed player? I could not help remembering Clancy Brown, here a decent prison guard, as a tough in 'Bad Boys', another prison favorite, when he was younger. I am going out of my way to recommend this film to friends who have not seen it.",9,0,2,30 January 2001
The Departed," The Dee-PAH-tid, as we say here.
","Well, where to start? Martin Sheen gets Most-exaggerated-Boston-accent Award. Jack Nicholson gets Most-like-'here's johnny!' Award (again). Alec Baldwin gets the He-really-looked-and-acted-like-a-local-Irish-American-bully-cop Award. No awards for Marky W... he was just playing himself back in Southie. Great retelling of a notorious Boston story. Can't wait to see the one about the Big Dig, Mr. Monahan. I hope Whitey and his brother Billy Bulger got a chance to see this one. I think Scorcese went a little Little Italy on the violence. Too many bullet wounds and not enough baseball bats and beer bottles, the more traditional weapons of Boston hoodlums. A gripping suspense thriller most of the time. A short 152 minutes. It's a shame that Monahan's villains met a moralistic end. Life here in Boston just hasn't worked out that way.",8,3,6,19 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Plod or plot?
","The gang of eight monstrous, giggling little girls at the back of the theater where I saw this film made me acutely aware of the delicacy of its pace, longish silences and deadpan mood. That having been said, I admit to liking the story and the execution of a subtle, mind-bending plot. My viewing companion said, 'It was like having a novel read to you.' He really liked it...more than I did. Emma Thompson ran through her range from haggard neurotic to supercilious Brit. Queen Latifa did her usual limit-setting, hard-edged woman of humble beginnings. Dustin Hoffman seemed to be pacing out an extended cameo. Not much energy in his performance at all. Will Ferrel was impressive as the protagonist. It was a pleasant surprise to find out he really can act. Maggie Gyllenhaal was superb and delivered the best performance in the piece, I believe. If you like moody, thoughtful and slow-paced...go see this one.",8,0,4,16 November 2006
Amélie," A 'must see' picture.
","This is a 'must see' picture, and I am going to suggest that it will become a favorite holiday tape for reviewing. I saw it on Christmas Day, since I was concerned it might leave in the crush of Christmas releases. I was sorry I had waited so long to see it. Intelligent, visually intense and beautifully filmed, well acted in the best French farcical tradition, this movie rocks! It's fun, fantastic and sexy, but the amazing thing is that it is also very real in its characterizations of human behaviors and, especially, human quirks. An absolute treasure that nourished eye, mind and soul. And, in case you are unfamiliar with my comments here, I don't usually go on like this!",10,1,3,26 December 2001
300," Hercules for the new millennium.
","OK. I get that this is a comic book depiction of a notable moment in military history. But this pseudo-epic is neither comic book nor history. What it appears to be is pro-war, pro-nationalist propaganda of the most American kind, aimed at the young, male and impressionable, at a time when we are debating sending more and more youngsters to the botched war in Iraq. It seemed obviously racist to me. It also seemed obviously homophobic. This is particularly odd since the real 300 were also known as an army of lovers and were trained to fight and die in pairs. It also seemed obviously ethnocentric. I you don't see these elements, I suggest you do some reading other than comic books. Oh, by the way, 'graphic novel' exaggerates this form to a literary level it does not actually satisfy. In my early years, we had Steve Reeves in the Hercules movies. These were dubbed perversions of Greek mythology. It seems one thing to pervert mythology and another to pervert the national history of another country. I don't believe this is a Greek production. Finally, I studied ancient history in great detail during my old-fashioned education. The picture I came away with hardly resembled this Kung Fu, soft-porn epic. I advise those inspired by the film to check out the rich history from which it evolved and morphed. It is far more interesting.",3,8,17,23 March 2007
