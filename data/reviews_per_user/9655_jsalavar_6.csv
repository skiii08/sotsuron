Casablanca," OK, why is this movie so great??
","I'm like Stepp, who posted similar comments on Sept 16th. We watched it for the first time last night and I failed to see what all the fuss is about. Was it a good movie? Yeah. Was it a classic? Not that I could see. First, I felt like I was watching the 1942 verison of the Gilmore Girls because the dialog by the actors was at a lightning pace. I couldn't understand half of what was said at the beginning. Unfortunately, a storm knocked out our signal for about 15 min so that added to the confusion.The acting was OK. Again, they talked to fast at first, which is crucial when you're trying to figure out the plot. After that it went along fine. I even enjoyed the relationship between Bogart and the Chief of Police.Bottom line, hundreds of movies have come along since then that could hold Casablanca's candle.",Null,2,8,3 October 2004
Captain Marvel," An unfortunate necessity
","The only reason this movie exist is to bring her into the next avengers flick. Unlike many of the other Marvel films, you most likely will never watch this one again .Also, too many inconsistencies with her power after she obtaines her full power. And, at full power, she renders the rest of the avengers team useless. Hell, the dang cat renders the avengers useless.",4,7,13,8 March 2019
The Dirty Dozen," Big Disappointment
","Why this film is called a classic, I'll never know. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years and made an attempt to watch most of it last night. All-star cast but terrible editing and sound. Can't really describe it but it was almost like the movie was dubbed in parts, especially those parts where the 'dozen' were razing someone.Also, America's heavy involvement in the European theater lasted less than an year(June'44 - May '45). I find it odd that we would have troops conducting maneuvers during that time.Too many other great war movies to watch. Don't waste your time on this one.",3,5,12,9 August 2007
The Graduate," Would you believe...
","The story didn't make a lot of sense. First, Dustin's character was all bummed out at the beginning, for reasons that were unclear and didn't make sense considering he just finished a very successful college career. Second, he had one date with Mrs Robinson's daughter, which started off terribly but ended well. On their attempted 2nd date she finds out about him and Mrs Robinson and ends with her crying and running off. Those were their only two interactions and yet on their 3rd meeting, which takes place several months later, she's open to marrying the guy.Oh, yeah, that is so true to life! (rolling eyes) Still, its entertaining and worth watching.",7,0,2,7 August 2008
Creed II," Typical Rocky Formula but still entertaining
",My only issue is that they're trying to pass Michael B Jordan off as a heavyweight. It looks like a middleweight,7,0,1,18 April 2019
Alien: Covenant," Rehash of alien/aliens
","Bottom line, not a very good movie. Too many similarities to Alien and Aliens And way too many unanswered questions. I thought Prometheus was actually entertaining and this movie should've tied everything up into a nice night but it did not. Too many holes in the plots. Nothing that ties anything to the original Alien. Still does not explain the ship that was found on uninhabitable LV-426",4,1,4,18 May 2018
