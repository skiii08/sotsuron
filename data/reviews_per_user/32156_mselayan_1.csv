The Equalizer," Entertaining But!
","I watched The Equalizer yesterday at the movie theater. I think I had a good time watching this thriller with friends while munching on my nachos. The events of the movie keep you excited and trying not to blink so you don't miss the imminent next kill. Washington was great as usual.. another movie to join his smart choices list.Aside from being a good theater watch experience, a lot of the events did not make a lot of sense and I feel I have to point out that I just used euphemism here. I find that the peculiar killing methods and dexterity were being excessively used as a tool to distract the spectator from the nonsensical part of the scene. For instance, the protagonist receives a threat call and is told to come to the home market and surrender before his coworkers are killed, and the next thing you know is a place perfectly set up for slaughtering his opponents one after another. Wire systems, hanging apparatuses and many other flawlessly prepared traps, not to mention the part where the other men and their chief Teddy who was unduly being referred to as the sharp and undeceivable psychopathic criminal were unable to determine where the drilling, fight groans and broken glass noises are coming from.This is one of the movies you would definitely recommend to any mind-blowing action/thriller movies enthusiast. On the other hand, for diligent movie viewers or those who pay good attention to the plot and its technical aspects, it's just one of those movies on the shelf with a 'Don't Bother Watch' label.",6,12,23,26 September 2014
