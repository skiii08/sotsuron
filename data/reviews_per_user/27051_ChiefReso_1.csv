Miracle," One of My All-Time Favorite Sports Movies
","I remember the 1980 US Hockey Team's victory over the Soviet Team like it was yesterday. It's just one of those things that if you were fortunate enough to see, you'll never forget. The 80's were one of the worst economic times for this country I can ever remember (I was 14 at the time) and this was indeed about a lot more than just hockey. It became what was indeed the GREATEST moment in sports that I will ever see. To re-live this moment through the film 'MIRACLE' is a real treat. I know where the story is going to go. I know how it is going to end. BUT this movie manages to capture my soul and bring me in every time I see it! I have seen this movie over and over and it still gets me! (I saw it 3 times in a row on a flight to Scotland and I still got all misty-eyed). I grew up watching Kurt Russell and have always liked him. I think his portrayal of Herb Brooks is EXCELLENT and by far one of the best performances he has ever had on screen. Buy this film. Watch it over and over again. Feel the dream.
