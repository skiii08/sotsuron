The Hangover," Freaking hilarious
","I had a feeling about this movie, from watching the trailers, and let me say, it's THE most hilarious movie I have ever seen. It's escapism at its best. Who wouldn't want to roll into a movie theater, be thoroughly entertained for 100 minutes and literally laugh your *ss off so many times you come out feeling like you've done two hours of crunches at the gym the next day? It's rude. It's vulgar. It's raunchy. It's so, SO politically incorrect. And it doesn't apologize for any of it, which I LIKE. There are many grains of truth in it's absurdity, which really is what makes it so funny. The cast clicks and the story line, while ridiculous, is engaging. I absolutely loved it. I'd go see it again, and it would be just as funny the 2nd time.For those who hated it, to each his own. That's why some of us like sushi and some can't stand it. C'est la vie.",10,3,6,27 July 2009
