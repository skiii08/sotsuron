The Rock," The Last Great Action Movie!
","wonderfully overdone explosions and high octane thrills, The Rock is the last great action film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow, In the same calibre as top gun and mad max! wonderful performances from all around, not at all corny but so far-fetched you have to love it! Nicolas Cage is just as exiting to watch as in con-air. If you see any modern action film you will notice little ideas and concepts invented in the rock. Wow, 'BRAVO' 'two thumbs Up' 'the last great action film'. Even if your a lover of the 'intellectual films' such as lost in translation you will love this film. Sean Connery does nothing less then deliver a cool slick role that should be remarked upon as great acting. although not the type of movie that wins Oscars does not take away from the fact it is a great film.",9,2,3,28 December 2008
