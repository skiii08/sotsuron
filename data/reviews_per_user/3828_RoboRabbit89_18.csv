Resident Evil: Afterlife," Still weak on story but better on the action.
","After the first two films which I consider the best, this
franchise quickly went down hill in Extinction but after
I seen this film I felt well at least it's a little better than
the third film.I first seen this back in 2011 on DVD 
when another buddy of mine brought over a 
bootleg copy on DVD and I found it to be better than the third film.
He did as well and felt the third was probably the worst in the series,
at the time I agreed with him but the third has grown on me and I'm
more OK with it now.Unlike the third film, this one gets right to it with a strong action packed
opening and it delivers. Alice storms an Umbrella Corporation with her
multiple copies in Tokyo, but soon she is turn back to her normal human
state( still having her over- the-top fighting abilities) by Wesker and her copies get KIA after Wesker detonates the facility
on his getaway chopper. Also this franchise begins to become inconsistant
in this film but it really started with Extinction. Alice meets a new group of survivors and they band together to
fight the undead that has breached their strong hold.I give it a 6/10. better than the third with fun over the top
action scenes.",6,0,2,17 March 2018
Terminator Salvation," Cool, dark and intense...a nice addition to the franchise.
","Post apocalyptic Los Angles. The machines have risen. The year is 2018 in 'Terminator Salvation'.Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed this film, it was a nice change of pace for something different,so I'm glad that they chose to do the future war. Trouble was director McG didn't have these three ingredients: First- there was no Arnold.Second- Setting the time frame of the future war in 2018 instead of 2029 sort of ticked off fans. And last but not least, Third- Giving this a toned down PG-13 rating instead of an R rating of what the audience expected.Having said that, I still enjoyed it for what it was.This may contain some spoilers.Marcus Wright, the guy we see in the beginning, of the film set in 2003 is a convict on death-row about be executed for a crime that he possibly committed. But before he is committed he is ask to donate his body to science but it's really Cyberdyne Systems.Fast forward to the future war of 2018, Marcus wakes up in some type of bunker as he exits he sees the world is a cold dark wasteland. He later teams up with a young Kyle Reese as they embark on a journey to find John Connor. Marcus and John form an uneasy alliance for John learns Marcus is cyborg, but uses him to help infiltrate Sky-net's compound. It's flawed but, I think it was at least a little better than T3.I give it a 6/10 a cool fun action movie. If your a fan of the franchise I recommend it.",6,1,3,11 October 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," Simply a weak third film in the series.
","I will be honest, this film is not my favorite in the series,
back when this was a new release on DVD in 2008, my buddy brought
his DVD copy over and after seeing it I was let down by it, also I thought
in a sweet nostalgic way it was going to be the end of the story. I was wrong.I was mainly disappointed with it because it doesn't really do
anything different in terms of story, it's just more of the same,
but in a new location this time the Nevada desert. Also it doesn't follow
where the second film leaves off which always bugged me, even to this day. 
I really wanted to see the adventure that took place after the second 
film with the scientist's little girl.The story from this film and the three sequels on word is pretty lazy,
the action scenes are OK but what really lacks is story.
As of today I feel a little better about the film I still think it's weak
but after seeing it more often the film grew on me. The story is honestly confusing because you don't really know
what is going on it's kinda hard to explain without ruining the film.
But the action scenes are alright, luckily it's fast paced enough not to
be boring which it could have easily done.I give it a 5/10. Not the best but watchable. I'm at least glad Afterlife was better.",5,1,3,17 March 2018
The Terminator," A good thinking man's action movie.
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is unstoppable in'The Terminator.'I first seen this when I was 3 years old on VHS and was blown away by it.It's haunting atmosphere and it's grittiness.It's both intriguing and frighting, that is so original.Sometimes this is referred to being called a horror movie. It's not really but sort of a hybrid of both sci-fi and horror.This may contain some spoilers.The year is 1984. The Terminator arrives and goes an a killing rampage in Search for his ultimate target: 'Sarah Connor.'Kyle Reese arrives to rescue her from Terminator. Unknown to her, her destiny is to help insure the survival of the entire human race form being wiped out by the machines and an artificial intelligence supercomputer known as Sky-net for Kyle's future time.What can I say It is just fast pace thrill ride from start to finish I totally love this movie it's just cool.I give it a 7/10 an awesome film that gets the franchise off to a nice fun start. It's a thinking man's action movie.",7,1,2,11 October 2017
Predator," Predator is a damn good movie.
","This film is a lot of fun to watch, Arnold is at his best.
The story is very simple, a group of commandos,
lead by Dutch (Arnold),must extract some hostages from 
hostel guerrilla forces in some Amazon jungle (can't remember
the exact location).The mission was going quiet well...until they run into
the extremely dangerous, extraterrestrial aka the Predator!
Soon the Predator kills off Dutch's team one by one until only
he and the Predator remain, and face off against each other...
that only one can survive!The youngest I can remember seeing this was age 4 I think on HBO,
I loved it then and now. Back in 2009 my mom found it at a goodwill along
with it's sequel Predator 2 both on VHS, then in 2012 I got Predator 2 on
DVD, and the original Predator I recently got on DVD in 2018.The supporting cast is great as well, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Carl Weathers
I don't remember the other two Latino actors but the were good as well.Overall, an awesome film with an original story and concept.
I give it an 8/10. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,4 October 2018
Man of Steel," A good reboot of Superman, an awesome flick.
","Let me start by saying, that this is the Superman movie I was waiting years for, I mean years. I found this movie to be very well made and honestly pretty damn good.Now I do like the Christopher Reeve Superman films, even though I have not see them in years, I only own the first film on VHS and fourth film we have on VHS as a TV copy with a few others movies on it. The only Superman film I did not like was 'Superman Returns' and that film I seen in theaters with a buddy, more on that for another review.Now, this film I did not see in theaters but waited for DVD because I guess I was a little worried this was going to stink. But I was pleasantly surprised and relived that it was very good but most importantly it was awesome and re-watchable.Henry Cavil is an awesome Superman and thank god the studio chose him because you need a good actor to play this iconic character, I have not seen him in very much but I think he is more or less starting out as an actor right now.Amy Adams is a damn good Lois Lane and she was great for the part I have not seen her in much, but she is a good actress she was a good choice for the part. And I think she is a very sexy lady too.Laurence Fishburne is probably the best Parry White I have seen, I mean there are other actors who are good that played the character but he is probably the best, and thank god they did because you need a good actor to pull off a convincing boss.Michael Shannon is probably the best or at least second best General Zod, he was damn good as the main villain and the end fight scene was a blast, I mean what a colossal fight, it got my adrenaline going, Michael was another good choice.Director Zack Snyder did a good job delivering a real Superman movie that I been waiting for years for. As for his past films, I didn't like them very much I sort only liked the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake and that's about it. But his movies now as far as the DCU I've enjoyed very much. Plus the supporting cast was great as well. Overall, a damn good film that I enjoyed, I mean, I almost regret not seeing it in theaters, it was fun and action pact, very action pact, and I liked that it had a lot of action.I give it an 8.3/10. An awesome reboot and return for the Man of Steel. Definitely, a good time, I watched it with my mom and she enjoyed it.I highly recommend it.",8,2,2,2 December 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A weak but fun third installment...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator in 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.'When I was 13 back in 2003, I first saw this and was quite blown away by it. I had to a least see it twice, but a couple of years later I started to sour from it. Even my mom said it wasn't as good as the first two films, and I had to respectfully agree it's not.However, recently a couple of yeas ago I have found myself starting to like this film again.This may contain some spoilers.The year is 2003. The newest nemesis from the future arrives in the form of a woman this time, The TX.She is here to eliminate John Connor's Lieutenants to ensure the machines victory.Later the Terminator arrives and teams up with a now adult John, he informs him about the TX and how he is not sure if he can defeat her, along the way they find a young woman that is a veterinarian and that her fate is linked to john's.With time running out, they quickly learn the young woman's military father is unknowingly about to activate Sky-net it's self. Which actives the rise of the machines.A weak entry in the franchise but usually third parts are, let me into the positives here.First I would like to say Arnold Schwarzenegger was great in his return to his famous roll. Even though this version of the character is a little less friendly form his T2 counterpart. Arnold was still cool as always.The action scenes were very good here, lots of expositions and gun battles. The vehicle stunt work is amazing and quite impressive with very little CG. Even the CG work is still good even by today's standers.Now for some of the negatives, now this dose not apply to everything else in the movie, just some things.Kristana Loken is OK as the TX character, however I mostly blame the writers for this. They just made her a sexy character that's all brawn and no brains. Not that I don't like her being sexy because I do, It would have worked out better if she was more scary and intimidating.Nick Stahl is OK as John Connor, but I feel ether he wasn't written well enough or if it was the actor I can't tell.Claire Danes is pretty good as Kate Brewster, but she wasn't given enough to work with.It has it's flaws but, I still think I does the job, it's still entertaining. I know some people sort of hate it like I did for a time, but It's a cupcake. It's a nice frothy cupcake and if you look at it as that it can be a wonderful piece of froth.I give it a 5.3/10 it's not bad more of a so-so action thriller, but it can be a real good time in the right mind set. If your a fan of the franchise give it a look.",5,1,2,11 October 2017
"I, Robot"," A good sci-fi action movie with a mystery-thriller at it's center.
","Let me get to it, Will Smith is really good in this movie, I like that he plays a cop who is afraid of robots but at the same time knows that they are useful.Will plays Del Spooner a police detective who stumbles on to a crime that a robot may have murdered a human.I own this on DVD, I first seen this back in 2004 in theaters with a buddy and he and I agreed that this was the best film of that summer.Bridgette Moryahan is also great as Dr. Suzanne Calvin who looks after the robots at USR Robotics Corporation, and is like Will's character but opposite, she trusts robots but not humans.Bruce Greenwood is good as the CEO, head of the corporation who is like the bad guy, his is good at playing bad guys. I haven't seen him in very much with but he is a good actor.Overall, a good action-mystery thriller that shouldn't be missed. I give it a 7/10. I highly recommend it.",7,0,1,7 November 2017
Wanted," A good rock solid action film.
","Let me start by saying that this film is a blast. I originally wanted to see this in theaters but the money was tight so I had to wait for DVD. I first saw this on my buddy's copy on DVD. He and I and another friend of mine really liked it.I found it original and fresh, you didn't essentially know where it was going and that was good, and it always surprised you in unique and interesting ways.The action scenes were awesome and fun to watch and it had a well made, well paced story that was easy to follow.James McAvoy is a very good actor and a great lead in this film. He is good in the latter X-Men films and a joy to watch.Morgan Freeman was awesome as Sloan, leader of the organization of assassins.Angelina Jolie was awesome as Fox, she was sexy, a little edgy and fun to watch.Overall, a really cool action film that I enjoyed. I give it a 6/10. I highly recommend it.",6,2,3,16 November 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best sequel to date.
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as The Terminator in'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.'Let me start by saying T2 is the best. This film is considered the best film of all time and I have to respectfully agree. I honestly have to say I think this film surpasses the original in every respect.The year is 1995. Eleven years after her first encounter with The Terminator, Sarah Connor is in mental psych ward and people think she's crazy or is she? Her son John Connor is a rebellious 13 year old child that lives with foster parents.Later that night, The Terminator arrives in search for John. The next morning he finds him in mall,but this time to protect him form the menacing,unrelenting T-1000 who also arrived that night.And so the chase is on.After John has Terminator get his mother out of the asylum they high tail it to the desert where they find a weapons cache,and head back to the city were they meet Mile Dyson the man that started it all.After Terminator convinces him about the demise of the 'cool tech', they all head to Cyberdyne Systems to destroy his research so this can never happen again. Suddenly The T-1000 his hot on their trail circle-ling in for the kill.I first seen this film and T1 back in 1993 when I was 3 on VHS and I was blown away.I'll express everything I like about T2.Arnold is excellent as The Terminator he's just a bad-ass hero of the piece.Linda Hamilton is also a bad-ass as Sara Connor in this one just too bad she didn't pursue more roles like this.Edward Furlong is pretty good as John Connor since this is his first feature film. Too bad he got in to drugs, it sort of ruined his career.Robert Patrick is phenomenal as The T-1000 he plays one of the coolest villains in history.Joe Morton is great as Miles Dyson he is just memorable as that character I haven't seen him in much else.Overall, a cool action packed sequel to the original Terminator.If you have not seen this film, what are you waiting for?I Give it an 8.9/10 by far the best sequel to date.",8,1,3,11 October 2017
Salt," I love Salt.
","Let's get going, back in July of 2010 I first seen this in theaters, when I first seen the trailer for this I definitely wanted to see it. Now, when I did seen this I absolutely loved it, I own it on DVD and have enjoyed it ever since.Angelina Jolie is a bad ass chick in this film and I loved it, I hope she will do a sequel to this soon since the movie is left open ended.I love spy thrillers and when done well they are fun, but I also like them as action films too. This film was very good, the action scenes are awesome and I thought the story was good too if not a little convoluted.This was the only film I seen that summer but it was worth it, overall I give it a 7/10. Probably the best action film of the summer of that year and Angelina's best action film in her resume.It was fun and action packed I highly recommend it.",7,12,15,16 November 2017
Resident Evil," The best in the series.
","I first seen this back in 2004 on a VHS copy that my buddy owned, he myself and another buddy watch it together.Since It was my first experience seeing the movie I totally loved it,
which was surprising because at the time I wasn't sure about it, since it was
a horror movie, I stayed away from them a lot as a little kid.
The suspense is quite creepy but not too creepy because it's also an action
movie blended in to one, however this first installment is more suspense with
good jump scares and small action scenes.
The pace is fast and the movie is kinda edgy in music and action sequences,
I've seen the remake of the original game which my one buddy owns on Game Cube, it's good but also really creepy and I like that the movie captured that essence.
Alice played by MIlla Jovovich is the heroine of the film, who has amnesia,
as we met her she comes to the shower, which looks like she hit her head,
she is oblivious to things as the audience is, we lean what's going on as she
does. Which I feel is fresh for as zombie movie.The movie is 100 minutes but fairly fast paced and has an engaging story,
so you met characters as the movie goes. Alice is joined by special forces-like
operatives that inform her and a couple other characters about what's
going on.
Video game purists will not like this movie but casual audiences will probubly
enjoy it, it's made to be popcorn fun that's all, it should not be looked at as
anything else but a fun movie however haters will hate so each there own I
guess.Overall I enjoy the film to this day, for me it's a guilty pleasure.
I give it a 7/10. If you want a fun but suspenseful action film
with fun action scenes and great scares look no further.
Give it a look. It's fun.",7,3,4,5 March 2018
I Am Legend," The Last Man On Earth...Is Not Alone.
","I'll get right to it, Will Smith is great in this film, he shows a great deal of vulnerability as a battle harden soldier/army doctor trying to cope with fear, uncertainty and loneliness.This story, I know is loosely based on the book of the same name, which has been adapted twice before as, The Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man. In this story , with only his dog for company Dr. Robert Neivelle, lives in a desolated New York City for the past three years with no human contact,but lurk-inking in the shadows are mutant plague victims watching his every move,struggling to find survivors and desperately trying to find a cure using his own immune blood.I first seen this with a buddy the opening weekend back in 2007, we both very much enjoyed it, we both enjoy Will Smith and thought the story was good.A year later, I decided to look up the book and I was surprised that it was adapted into two other films which I've seen, more on that for another review.Overall, I liked this film, I own it on DVD and I think this should be seen by more people if it hasn't already. Now I know there are some novel purists out there who feel that this movie isn't close to the source, but I think this is the closest where going to get to the book with a PG-13 rating.I give it a 7/10. A good action-horror thriller with good character development and story. If you haven't seen this give it a look.",7,1,1,7 November 2017
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," The second best in the series.
","After seeing the first film I definitely wanted to see the sequel,
I can honestly say it was at least a little better then the first because
there is more. This time there is more action less scares.I seen this one on DVD with a buddy, after I responded well to the first
he had the second film and brought it over and we watched it, I loved it
even more because it had a lot of action and it left me wanting more,
because it ends on a cliffhanger.This film pretty much picks up right were the first leaves off,
Umbrella employees re-open the hive and release the zombies,
within a few hours the city is over-run by the undead. 
Alice wakes up as in the first and enters the city and helps a group
of survivors as they battle against Umbrella Corporation.There are plot twists that are confusing and some unexpected but it's fun.
And the best part a video game favorite, Nemesis is in it, and he is awesome.I give it a 7/10. A fun follow up to the first, and like the first, ends on
a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting more. But I'll be honest the series
goes down hill from here. This is the second best in the series.",7,1,1,17 March 2018
Mission: Impossible," A fun spy film means a good time.
","Let's get to it, Tom Cruise is awesome as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, whose team is murdered and he is the only survivor, and he must uncover a shadowy conspiracy about the NOC List.I own this on VHS and back in 2014 I found it on DVD at the video store in the mall. I think I first seen this back in 2000 on my video copy that my mom and I found at a flea market.This film is very well written, and well shot, and well directed by Brain DE Palma, he crafted a good edge of your seat thriller.Tom Cruise is a producer on this, I think this is the first film he produced, anyway he was good in this, for his first action movie even though this first film is more of a thriller.Ving Rhymes is good as Luther Stiklle, the computer expert of the team he plays a likable character in this and he's fun.As for the rest of the cast, they were pretty good too. I don't want to spoil it for you because there are some good twists in this. The action scenes are pretty cool even though there is minimal action, they are very satisfying especially the ending which I will not spoil.Overall, a cool spy thriller that was fun to watch and one that I enjoy very much.I give it a 7.4/10. If you like spy thrillers this one is cool and I highly recommend it.",7,0,0,2 December 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," The awesome sequel to the original.
","Well I have to start buy saying that this is an honestly good movie,
but with all sequels it has it's flaws as well. (There easy to overlook).I think that this takes place at least six months after the first,
and we get to see Zion an underground sanctuary where the human race
hides, we also learn that the machines are digging their way to them.
Neo flies, a prophecy is talked about and there is a ticking clock to all-out 
war with the machines.
(Let me get into the flaws first).First I would like to say that this is a fun movie, great action scenes
great visual effects. But the movie manly lacks in I would say character
development, maybe a bit of the story is a little muttled, and a little
confusing and convoluted. I can't place my finger on it but it's there,
to put it simply they should have done something else for the story.
Even before I seen this I was kinda expecting something different,
you know, new villains, new threat just something cool but different. 
Not that what is in it isn't and not that I was let down or anything when
I watched it but I'm saying that it was missed opportunities for something
really special.
(On to the good stuff).The action scenes are awesome and quite memorable,
my favorites are when Trinity is on the freeway in a high speed chase,
Morpheus fighting an agent on a semi-truck's trailer all the bad ass fights
with Neo.
There is a scene where Neo kisses Monica Bellucci that is quiet erotic
also Neo and Trinity have a sex scene in this, I can tell the directors wanted
to have some sex in this film LOL.
A side from that this was an enjoyable film to watch all though I do watch
this film a lot less these days, I do find myself going back to the first more
often. But this one is still good and ends on a cliffhanger leaving you wanting
more.Overall I give it a 7/10. Fun to watch every once and a while.",7,1,3,26 June 2018
RED," One cool spy action-comedy.
","RED is an awesome action-comedy. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast were great.This review may contain spoilers.We meet Frank (Willis) at home and we see he's living a lone. But soon masked armed men brake in, and shoot up the place, but the cunning Frank is no fool or an ordinary guy. He fights back, the intruders with deadly force, and we come to relies Frank is a retired CIA agent, with his cover blown he must reassemble his old team. Marvin, Joe, Victoria and a life insurance assistant named Sarah help Frank on his quest to find out why they've been tagged RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous).Overall, a cool action-comedy I really enjoyed. Great cast, funny and a well written story.I give it a 7/10. Highly recommended.",7,1,1,17 October 2017
The Matrix," One of the greatest movies ever made.
","Where do I begin, well I heard of this film back in 1999, and around
2000 I finally seen it as a rental first, with my dad. He and I both loved it,
it's quite original and unlike anything I've seen before, even at that time.Then in 2001 my mom and I found it on VHS, new I think? Can't remember.
I think it was, anyway she enjoyed it too. I have to admit this was part of my childhood, and it was great fun to watch over and over again. Even today.About the movie, This is a cyberpunk action-thriller, Thomas Anderson is a
hacker aka Neo under his alias, is what I think, kinda lost in life and is 
looking for Morpheus (as many times I have seen this, I have no idea why he's
looking for him, really). He is brought into the realization that the world he knows
is a clever computerized dream world!
Morpheus, Trinity, and the others join the fight to stop the machines called
sentinels that mankind has been at war with for a century. The cast, Keanu Reeves is great as Neo aka Thomas Anderson, he did a good
job, playing Neo slightly naive to all the carnage and to his destiny as 'The One',
being chosen to be the savior of the human race.Laurence Fishburne is great as Morpheus the leader of the team and mentor
to Neo and Trinity, his voice is so magnetic you are drawn in completely and 
he's just a damn good actor anyway. He's a pleasure to watch.Carrie Ann Moss is awesome as the ass kicking Trinity, I have to admit she is
a very sexy lady, she looks great in vinyl, it shows off her sexy shape well.
I still have not seen her in very much, but she is a really good actress, I hope
in the near future she will play in more action movies because she just rocks!Hugo Weaving is also great as the sort of main villain Agent Smith, he's great
playing creepy and emotionally robotic as Smith. Also a good foe to Neo and 
the others heroes, I haven't seen him in much either but he is a good actor too.
On to the action, the action scenes are unbelievably awesome and memorable
which is always good, my favorites are when Neo vs. Smith in the subway, 
the beginning with Trinity being chased by Agents as she jumps from roof top
to roof top and when Neo and Trinity have an epic firefight in a government lobby.
Overall a great piece of science fiction with epic action scenes and mind teasing
philosophical messages. I give it an 8/10. If you have not seen this, please see it,
we don't get movie this good anymore and if you've been dying to see something
completely original, look no further. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,5 March 2018
