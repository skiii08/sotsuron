The New World," Review
",I am watching this movie for a history through film class. The class is watching it together to see the differences in camera movements and different elements of Terrance Maliks filming. Arriving with the British expedition in Virginia is captain john smith. Is captured by native Americans. They spare his life because of a girl named Pocahontas. She was the daughter of the tribe chief. She had fallen in love captain john smith. John smith was sent away and his death was reported. Pocahontas went on and married John Rolfe and when john smith arrives Pocahontas is torn. For the year of the movie being filmed it was pretty advanced. Terrence Malik new how to capture things in different ways with the movements with his camera. How old Pocahontas was. I am sure there are lots of other connections to movies but i have not seen them. I do think that other directors have used Terrence Maliks movements and thought processes in there movies. I liked the movie in general. I liked the way the camera flowed with the mood of the movie. I like Terrence Maliks directing. I did not like that it wasn't 100% accurate.The movie was good. I would watch it again. I found it pretty interesting because I didn't know much about the Pocahontas story. Yes i would like to watch more movies from Terrence Malik. I like his directing.,6,0,0,4 September 2018
The Alamo," Review
",I am watching this movie for a history through film class. It was an informational film . It was about the Mexicans and the Americans fighting over Texas land. It is telling us about the war. They were very passionate about this land and this war. I noticed that the movie was out dated. They were filming about something from a long time ago. So i think they are trying to keep it as accurate as possible. I am sure there are some connections to other movies. I have not seen any though. I have seen movies with same actors in it. I liked the story line. I liked the information it gave us. I liked the movie. I didn't like the graphics. The movie overall was alright. I wouldn't watch it in my free time. I probably will watch more movies by the same director.,4,0,3,15 October 2018
Wonder Woman," wonderful
",I had watched this movie when it first came out in the movie theater. I thought it was an alright movie. All the fighting scenes are my favorite in this movie. She fought for everybody life by fighting a bad guy to get this poison that was gonna kill everybody. I didnt know anything about this part of history. Yea its decently interesting not something i would want to listen to everyday. Yes i have seen movie set in this time period before because of old history classes. Yes that she is a superhero.

Yes i like the actors that were in this movie Like i said the fighting scenes in this movie are the best scenes. I liked gal gadot. I didnt like the other actors. Yes i did.,Null,2,2,8 January 2019
Cinderella Man," depression
",My personal experience with this movie was great. I loved the movie i would watch it again. My favorite scene of the movie is when he starts to get back into boxing so he can provide for his family. The plot of this movie is that he was making a lot of money doing boxing and then the great depression came and he had lost a fight so we wasnt getting enough money to provide for his family. so he went out and started working multiple jobs. I knew that the great depression was a horrible time in life i knew that it was hard to get money and it was a very poor time period. I feel like i have watched movies set in this time period but none of them come to my mind. No there was no evidence that showed that it was made up. The director of the movie is Ron Howard. James J. Braddock was the main character in the movie being the boxer that goes through the hard times of the depression. Im pretty sure ive seen movies with them in it but i dont know what they are called. I liked the movie. I liked the movie it was a great movie. there wasn't one thing i didn't like. Yes i would have watched this movie outside of class. boxing movies intrigue me. Yes i would recommend this to a friend. I liked this movie a lot.,9,1,1,8 January 2019
