Blade Runner 2049," Conflicted - phenomenal cinematography, poor pacing
","This movie has the best cinematography I have ever seen, I can't stress enough just how good that aspect of it is. The acting is pretty good for the most part too, however the pacing and large periods of slow moving (or not moving at all and serving no real purpose) plot really let it down here. I found the original to be the better movie overall, but this is still worth a watch.",6,1,1,4 October 2019
