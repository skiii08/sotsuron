"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A great comedy
",If you're a fan of Simon Pegg you'll like this one. If you're a fan of comedies you'll like this one. It may be formulaic but Pegg's charisma and acting really shine thru.the plot has been summarized already by many so here's the review.The story was not new. There's the self-admitted loser (Pegg). The beautiful lady who is his object of desire (Newton). There's the off-kilter best friend (played superbly by Dylan Moran). And the too-good-to-be-true nemesis played by a surprisingly buff Hank Azaria.The strength of the film is its heart. The character of Doyle is a loser but as the film progresses he gains back some of your respect - bit by bit. The acting by Pegg is superb with his physical comedy being one of his strengths.Newton isn't called upon to do too much. Azaria gets the thankless role of being Mr Perfect and he does the transition from Knight in Shining Armour to A$$hole of the Year very well.The direction by Schwimmer is a surprise. It never seems forced. the pacing seems just right. And London never looked more bright and cheery.8/10,Null,0,1,3 September 2010
Changeling," Wow, where to begin
","The first 1/2 of the movie had me disturbed, frustrated, and agonizing for the protagonist. The fact the movie was based on a true story made it very troubling that this type of injustice and corruption could occur in a 'civilized' country during a 'civilized' time.But when the courtroom scenes take over the film seems to lose itself a little and some of that tension that was built in the first half seems to subside.it's not until one of the last scenes where that tension is brought back again.Jolie's performance was excellent. She looks a little anorexic in this one but it suits the character well, perhaps an indicator of the horrible stress she had to go through in her ordeal with missing a child, being forced to adopt another one, and repeatedly being told she is wrong about her misgivings about the new child.Malkovich is actually a minor character in this one and really doesn't have that much to do acting-wise. The serial killer on the other hand makes the most of his screen time and delivers a truly wicked and disturbing performance.Another excellent film directed by Clint Eastwood. His choice of camera angles, lighting, and especially the initial farmyard scenes were masterfully done.8/10",Null,1,4,20 June 2010
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," if you liked the first, you'll like the 2nd even more
","A sequel should give viewers more of what they enjoyed from the first, less of what they didn't and add a few twists and turns to change things up a bit to keep you on edge.The style is the same as the first (same director after all), the witty repartee between Holmes and his sidekick Watson remains sharp as ever. But it's the introduction of Moriarty gives the film real life. He's the opponent that Holmes needs to truly shine, a genius on the side of evil versus a genius (albeit eccentrically so) on the good.The storyline has plot holes that I won't go into to too much here. But the weakest points of the film have to do with the actual mystery itself and connecting the dots between the gypsy brother and Moriarty. Noomi Rapace got a lot of screen time but didn't have much to do or say. She seemed to be getting in the way of the budding bro-mance between Holmes & Watson much like Mary Watson's character. In some ways, the role of the gypsy fortune teller really didn't need to be so prominent at all.The strength of the film is the fast paced action, the interplay between the characters, and the charisma shown by Law, Downey Jr and Jared Harris. It's a light-hearted, yet intriguing and suspenseful movie, so entertaining that it made me forgive its obvious flaws.9/10",Null,1,3,2 February 2012
Skyfall," don't believe the hype machine
",When this first came out there were so many reviewers absolutely agog over what they termed to be 'the best Bond ever'. I don't know what drugs they were on but they were certainly mind-altering. Skyfall comes nowhere close to being the best of the series. In fact I'd rate it as above QoS and below Casino Royale in the 'Daniel Craig trilogy'. !!!SPOILERS BELOW!!!The problems are numerous. There are too many plot elements here that we've seen before in other Bonds or in other movies. And worse yet is that they were done better in those movies. The worst for me however is the ending and that lasting impression wiped away any good will that was accrued in the first half of the film. It made no sense to have a 'plan' that would isolate Bond and M from the rest of MI6 - how is being stuck in a medieval mini-castle out in the middle of nowhere a good idea? OK so good stuff.... hmm... the new money penny is pretty and she has some decent dialogue with Bond. the New Q is a bit annoying to me but my buddies thought he was a good addition. the initial action sequence is good as is the scene in Shanghai. But once Bardem comes on screen with his cheesy bad guy it gets to be just a weird film. The villain is a mastermind but his motive is neither complicated nor interesting. Is that it? You've got a bad Hate-On for M? the standards for Bond films are higher in my books. As a regular film I could have given this a 6 but for a Bond I have to give it 5/10,Null,4,10,10 July 2013
Inglourious Basterds," overrated glorification of violence in WWII
","World War II was a horrible episode in history that lasted 6 years and took countless lives away all for the sake of hatred, greed, and tyrannical madness. And out of this springs Tarantino's movie about revenge, killing, and trying to find a way to kill as many Nazis on screen as you can. As with most Tarantino films the violence is over-the-top, outrageous, bloody, and definitely excessive. He makes a point with a sledgehammer when a tap would do. His scenes are also characteristically Tarantino. He has long stretches of dialog that seemingly are headed nowhere. But eventually his characters start getting closer to 'the point' and then the tension builds, makes the viewer want to know what's going to happen next. And then they start meandering again. And suddenly the scene's final climax will explode across the screen in a trail of blood and guts.as far as Tarantino films go I'd put this below his most famous works. In fact I'm perplexed as to how it got so many academy award nominations. I'll definitely agree that Christoph Waltz's performance was enthralling and Oscar worthy but the film as a whole, just too much excess in a setting that required a more sober touch. 6/10",Null,1,2,29 January 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," entertaining, action movie
","Full disclosure, I'm not a hard core Trekkie. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Lots of action, lots of twists and turns. For the true trekkies there's lots of references to past episodes but this being the 'parallel' universe introduced in the last film, I don't see why the reviews point to that as being a negative. It's no surprise that the directors would want to pay homage to the old while still making way for the new. And they do a wonderful job here. The philosophical discourses on morality, anthropology, right to live, logic vs emotion, is all still here - but given to you in 'sound-bites' interspersed with dramatic well-choreographed action sequences. The interplay between Spock & Kirk which to me was a strength in the first film, continues here and actually seems to improve. The villains were well cast and Cumberbatch especially does a great job at being the 'superior' genetically engineered human. One of the plot twists took me a while to digest and after a while it seemed to be dizzying. I'm not a big fan of how they 'rescued' the ending which is why I cannot give this film 10/10.9.5/10",Null,3,6,28 May 2013
Public Enemies," Not sure what to make of this
","Maybe the marketing was bad, leading me to believe this was a film that it wasn't. Maybe the story was bad, not quite able to draw the viewer (me) in to their world of crime society at the turn of the century. Maybe the characters were too shallow, or their inner-workings too subtle, making it difficult for me to care about them.In any case, if, at the end of a movie, I'm asking all these kinds of questions, you know I'm not going to give it a good grade. I've never been a fan of 'bad guy' as the hero/protagonist type of story. And that is what Mann has been serving up in many of his movies. So perhaps it is my bias. But the main characters, who are marketing as having this cat-and-mouse type game between them rarely interact. There's no strategy. There's no planning. It's just 'hey, let's go rob a bank with a bunch of guns and a getaway car'. Followed by the good guys saying, 'OK men, this is a dangerous assignment, be prepared to be killed in a hail of bullets, and if you see them, shoot to kill'. Repeat that formula about 6 times and you get Public Enemies.5/10 not recommended.",Null,0,0,10 May 2012
Elizabeth," Overrated
","i'm not a big English history buff which is probably why I don't understand half this movie. It seems to be catering to that crowd.A character may be introduced once, his significance hinted at but that character never really does or say anything of importance - unless it's 'hinted' at.take the Spanish guy with the goatee who gets to hang around court all the time. What was the deal with him? Sneaking around, talking to Joe Fienees about what? they never really say anything.and then Joe Fiennes - who is somehow guilty of treason for being addressed in a letter from the pope - gets no real punishment whatsoever? The only reason I gave this 4/10 is the acting by Cate Blanchet and the costumes and some interesting directing choices. That's about it. Had to struggle to watch for 2 hrs.",Null,0,1,21 May 2010
Troy," Pitt overrated. Simplistic story doesn't deserve a 7/10
","I was disappointed in the story which I found rather simplistic. A junior high school student could have done better than this. No twists. No turns. Just straight on fill in the blanks between fight sequences (which were really good by the way).The acting was uneven. I thought Eric Bana's performance was riveting. You could see the internal conflict in his eyes as he anticipates a war which he feels is needless. Peter O'Toole was also excellent - making the character an extension of himself and also displaying his screen presence. On the opposite spectrum was Achilles (Brad Pitt). Pitt played him like a whiny, self-absorbed, conceited a$$hole. I don't think he was written that way. There are many scenes where Pitt is disinterested and it shows. His monotone delivery of his lines got tiresome early on.The fight scenes were well staged and exciting. The cinematography was very good - but not Lord of the Rings good.I give it a passing grade but not by much: 5/10",Null,1,3,1 November 2005
Ocean's Twelve," yawn
","wasn't very impressed.no snappy dialogue like the first one. no intriguing case like the last one. None of the actors seemed to really be interested in this one except for George Clooney who oddly enough didn't play as prominent a role in this one.I don't like Steven Soderbergh's herky-jerky camera style and I didn't understand what effect it was supposed to bring to this. Using it during a chase scene or a fight scene, then yes I can understand. But during some filler-dialogue? Huh? I don't know why people rave about his work so much.The worst though is the climax of the story when they describe in detail what supposedly happened. No big intricate planning. Could have been done by street punks.",Null,0,0,9 June 2006
Alien," I didn't like it much
",I don't get the enthusiasm for this movie. As of today it's the #62 movie of all time. I found it had some rather dry boring parts that didn't add to the story or to the mood. Cinematography was amateurish. Plot was straightforward without any interesting points to it. No real character development. I just kept waiting for the beast to kill them all. I didn't really care for any of the characters. A suspenseful movie only works when you actually care about what becomes of the main characters and I didn't feel any warmth to this movie at all.This movie hasn't aged very well either. Looks very 80's-ish. I found Sigourney Weaver's hair to be scarier than the Alien itself.,Null,2,5,1 February 2006
The Doors," Couldn't finish it
","I listen to the Doors on occasion whenever they're on the radio. I like some of their music but I wouldn't classify myself as a fan. I'm also not a big fan of the 60's-70's. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be either a Doors fanatic or someone totally enamoured of the 60s & early 70s.Watching this movie was quite a snoozer for me. Couldn't make it past the candle-lit witch meeting. The scenes seemed to go on forever. The antics of Morrison (Kilmer) made me think this guy was a self-absorbed, selfish, pitiful guy who took it out on everyone else and thus destroyed himself.Maybe that was the point, but I didn't want to sit for 2+ hours watching it being relentlessly shown on screen from different angles. I guess Bart Simpson was right about showbizness. 'Repetitiveness is my job... my job... repetitiveness is my job!'",Null,1,3,31 August 2005
Life of Pi," Gorgeous film to look at. Truly art via CGI
","LOTS OF SPOILERS BELOW: in the DVD extras Ang Lee is quoted as challenging the CGI Tech team to create moving works of art. And boy did they ever deliver.In a film like this where the ocean dominates the scenery and in itself becomes a 'character' and antagonist it is important to have it rendered well and here it is brilliant. So vibrant and realistic.That's just part of the fun. The tiger is amazing. It's hard to believe it's mostly CGI. And the acting by the young Pi is also incredible, especially when watching the extras and seeing him; eyes fully bugged out in terror at the tiger, while staring at a green screen.The story line seems bare but when you think about the raw emotions being delivered on screen it really hits home. the maturation of the young boy into a survivalist young man is quite an epic adventure.The ending - well I'll leave that alone. It' quite the twist and really makes you think hard about what's true, what's a representation of the truth. When he asks at the end 'which do you like better' I started re-thinking about what it was I had just watched. And I think that's the mark of a great film.9/10",Null,1,2,3 April 2014
Pacific Rim," crash, bang, boom
","I watched this because I'd heard so many good things about Guillermo Del Toro. And the film looked good. The effects were quite impressive. But the movie felt hollow. It was all a beautiful exterior shell with no heart, nothing to keep it moving, and a threadbare plot acting as sinew holding it (barely) together.If you grew up watching the Michael Bay Transformer movies, then this is your adult version because the plot is slightly more complicated this time around.The plot summary is basically, bad guys are alien fish like giants. Humans fight back by creating giant robots controlled by humans. Lots of fights happen, destruction and mayhem ensues, and voila, you've got a blockbuster on your hands.there are some minor characters that do get screen time and backstory time. They work great as caricatures. And that's about it. I don't want to watch this ever again, and likely not interested in the rumoured sequel.crash bang boom kaching 5/10",Null,2,2,17 December 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Forumulaic superhero movie
","Wow. CGI and special effects fans will be enthralled. Nothing beats somehow transforming a normal human being into a short, super skinny weakling. And then a few scenes later, the same actor becomes an indestructible super-human specimen with 0.5% body fat. They must have spent a lot of time, effort and money to make that happen so seamlessly. It looks so real.Unfortunately that also means that there was a lot less time, effort, and money remaining to create a story, build supporting characters, and make a deeper storyline. As it is, it's an entertaining movie. Has some great caricatures for supporting characters. Tommy Lee Jones does his usual bit as the sarcastic, abrasive, yet witty man in charge. Hugo Weaving hams it up as the bad guy who's super charged body rivals Captain America's. The girl is a throw in - but she's required because, this is the prototypical formulaic superhero movie.6/10 nice to watch... once.",Null,0,0,11 May 2012
Burn After Reading," Better than I expected
","I really liked this movie. I had no idea what to expect. I'm not a big Clooney fan and I'm not a big Pitt fan. I've seen a few Coen brothers movies before (Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou) and was entertained but not to the point where I thought they were cinematic geniuses.Acting: Brad Pitt really changed my mind about him. Here he is unrecognizable from many of his recent roles. In this movie he is playing a dufus to the hilt. He looks like he enjoys what he's doing. Clooney's acting has never done it for me, I find him to be a one note kind of guy. This movie didn't do much to change that although he was a few shades dumber than his usual characters. Malkovich was fine. He is always good for a crazed guy kind of role.Story: don't expect any major plots and twists, but more a study of some very interesting (aka dumb) characters. Pacing was good.Overall 8/10",Null,1,2,3 July 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," underrated gem
","Good examples of animated movies combine the dazzling graphics and drawings, with good story lines, easy to follow 'moral of the story', and humour that children and adults can enjoy.'Monsters vs Aliens' successfully does all of that in my opinion. I knew nothing about this movie before watching it and I came away surprised that it is not talked about in the same regard as Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story franchise.The animation is exceptional. The characters are memorable and the monsters all play an important part in the storyline and in helping Susan find her own identity. The battle scenes are great but they are a small part of the real story which is Susan stepping out of her shell, and finding herself surrounded by the most unconventional friends imaginable.kudos to Seth Rogen who delivers a lot of the really funny lines and also to Stephen Colbert who's turn as the president of the US of A is hilarious. Parents who are familiar with 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' will especially enjoy the 'first contact' scene.9/10",Null,1,3,28 April 2011
Goon," simple minded Goon is entertaining, mindless fare
","There's no deep thoughts about fighting or it's role in hockey. There's no deep psychological study of the goon and his motivations for punching another man for a living. this is light hearted comedic film making - hockey style.Sean William Scott plays Glatt, a big hearted, strong fisted, weak brained individual. He's not the sharpest guy around but he's got a lot of good qualities including a fierce loyalty and two fists that can do a lot of damage. He loves his role as the enforcer on the team and he loves being part of the collective. His infectious enthusiasm wears off on his teammates and in the end, they stop short of a magical Hollywood ending - but it's a good one for Glatt and his mates. 7/10",Null,1,2,10 December 2013
District 9," SciFi movie with a great story and heart
","Wow. What can I say.The story starts off fast paced, getting the viewers caught up in Alien history in South Africa using an effective and familiar 'CNN' news story style.The story isn't overly complex. It's the characters that get you hooked. The lead character (Wikus) is brilliantly portrayed by Sharlot Copley. The awkward guy who's in charge of evicting all the aliens and who gets himself in trouble with a mysterious container.The story's parallels with real world events (Apartheid, American occupation of Iraq) are hard to miss and give it some deeper meaning.the effects are great, especially considering the film's budget.9/10 the only thing I didn't like was the extremely shaky camera work during the District 9 eviction scenes.

Twilight," this wasn't made for me
","This movie wasn't made for me. I'm not a preteen girl with a huge crush on Robert Pattinson. I'm not going thru some 'goth' phase nor do I harbour some secret vampire fetish. My wife was interested in this so I forced myself to watch. What did I see? The story centres around Bella and Edward. A star-struck teenaged romance which in the modern day means plenty of angst, brooding, moodiness, and latent desire. Not my cup of tea. The added twist is that whole 'vampire' thing. Can a vampire really have a relationship with his prey? The story twists vampire mythology to the point its totally unrecognizable. Vampires being afraid of the sun? Nope. Their skin turns into diamonds when exposed to sunlight. Poor babies... Vampires can pretty much do whatever their hearts desire as far as the CGI budget will take them. You no longer kill a vampire with a wooden stake but by dismembering him and burning up the pieces. All this became quite ridiculous in my old jaded eyes.The film tries to look sophisticated with a few arty camera angles. Lighting was pretty much the same throughout the movie - grays, muted by grayish blues, followed by dark grays. It's pretty much the Pacific Northwest in winter. I'll give them points for effort and it actually does look pretty convincing.Direction, well it was OK. Nothing mind boggling.Overall I'll give it 5/10 for effort. Story is definitely a minus because of a mopey, depressed love story, plus some outlandish perversion of the vampire lore.",Null,1,3,30 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Ugh. the female Hayden Christiansen
","When Hayden Christiansen gave his robotic performance of Annakin Skywalker he was widely panned and ridiculed.Double standard. I actually believe Kristen Stewart achieves the Keanu Reeves Hall of Fame for non-expressiveness in this movie. Watch her panic as she runs towards Edward. Then watch as she sorrowfully sits in a chair by the window. Same face. I actually forced myself to rewatch a few 'pivotal' scenes and yup. No change of expression. Nada zilch. How did she get into Hollywood anyways? She's not even that good looking...Anyways, on to the review. As with most sequels the 2nd one tries to amp it up a notch. In this case Twilight was an absurd movie, changing all the rules for a vampire to the point where I expected the Cullens to wear red capes with blue tights and a giant S on the front. They can fly. Their skin turns into diamonds in the sunlight. Absolutely ridiculous. Completely ignore the vampire lore from the past century and makes it up as they go.Now they do the same for werewolves. No full moon? No problem. Watch as Jacob turns into a werewolf while leaping in mid air to fight a vampire. Yup. Suddenly a werewolf's primary source of prey is a vampire.And that's pretty much it. Not much story in this one. I really hope I don't get forced to watch the third one.The only redeeming quality here is the campy performance by Michael Sheen. Sure it's over the top. But hey, who says a vampire has to be sullen, depressed, and expressionless all the time... oh, right. The Twilight series...3/10",Null,6,9,3 June 2011
Ip Man," Very good martial arts movie
","It's not an epic. So don't expect something like 'Hero'. It's not a complex tale so don't expect 'Curse of the Golden Flower'. What it is is a very good biopic of Ip Man, arguably the best Wing Chun martial artist of his time. He is portrayed by Donnie Yen, a real life martial artist. His background in the sport along with the masterful choreography by Sammo Hung gives the fight scenes a lot of realism and a lot of style. Wires are used but kept to a minimum unlike the 'wire-fu' epics that have over-saturated the market. the contrast between Ip Man's style of Wu Shu and the northerners is subtle but still there. Ip Man's moves are definitely more graceful than the brute force of the northerners. The Japanese viewers may not like the film as it focuses the second half of the film on the atrocities committed by them during World War 2. So obviously, even the soldiers being depicted as 'honorable' (such as General Miura) are still capable of despicable acts of violence and cruelty.Ip Man is a period piece and even the film itself has a dated quality about it. The acting is superb with some exceptions. Simon Yam is almost un-recognizable as the factory owner. He was great. But Donnie Yen's stoic face and lack of range sometimes were weaknesses. the actress playing his wife wasn't given much to work with and hence she doesn't have much to show. Many of the Japanese characters were caricatures. But overall it's a very entertaining martial arts movie that has some heart, some story and a lot of realistically choreographed fight scenes. Kudos to Sammo Hung for designing those and Donnie Yen for executing so brilliantly.",Null,0,1,11 February 2011
Avatar," spoilers below - beware
","This movie can be reviewed in 2 parts.Visually this is a stunning movie. Even if it wasn't 3D the backdrops, the scenery, the visual effects on the Navi are breathtaking. WETA has upped it a notch. Amazing how far they've come in such a short time. The 3D effect took me some time to get used to but once I was adjusted, WOW. Mind blowing. The motion was so smooth too, even on the effects shots. Just for the spectacle itself I had to give it a 7/10. Someone said this is a milestone movie, one in which people will be comparing the technical achievements of all future movies. I wholeheartedly agree.The storyline and character development however were sadly lacking. The story is simple, and that I could forgive. However, its parallels with 'Dances With Wolves' were too close and too obvious to miss. It's bad when you're sitting in a movie and are constantly reminded every 5 minutes that James Cameron photocopied the script to Dances with Wolves and stuck in Navi instead of Navajo. For that I gave him 1 point.So total is 8/10.Be sure to see this on a big screen in 3D, iMax if you have it...",Null,0,2,3 March 2010
Up," How does Pixar keep doing it?
","It's amazing how Pixar keeps making great animated films. They are somehow able to find that magic of compelling storyline, heart-felt characters, great voice actors, lively and light-hearted animation, and meaningful musical scores. Whatever magic potion they've got over there is really working. Dreamworks has been hit and miss. The other companies pale in comparison.Where to begin? How gutsy was Pixar to have a septuagenarian as one of its lead characters? And to top it off, deal with emotional gut wrenching themes of loss; through miscarriage, death of a loved one, and potential loss of a lifelong home. They spice things up by adding a young boy who's dealing with his own issues of abandonment, emotional distance from a father, and striving to achieve. Wow. Heavy stuff for a kids film. And yet Pixar pulls it off, making a film highly entertaining for young ones (my 6 yr old was captivated) and their parents.Just when you think things are getting too heavy, a change of pace comes along with the introduction of a group of dogs with collars that allow them to 'speak', as well as the antagonist of the story. A few chase scenes, some funny scenes, some serious bonding and voilÃ . A fantastic family adventure movie that ranks among the best ever made by any animation company.9/10",Null,0,0,11 April 2012
Zombieland," Excellent film - more comedy than horror
","a hilarious movie with zombies, a geeky protagonist introducing you to the new world of Zombieland. Too much mad cow turned into mad human disease and the US of A has turned into Zombieland.Woody Harrelson is great and completely believable as the Zombie killer with a grin. As someone else mentioned, the weakest part of the movie is the girls and the difficulty a mostly male audience would have in sympathizing with them, especially after our two male heroes get duped twice by them.I thought the cameo was great and was very fitting. Definitely did not run too long and ended very appropriately.I gave it 10/10 because I honestly could not think of a way to really improve this movie.",Null,1,2,15 March 2010
WALL·E," Wow. A very deep film yet entertaining for the kids
","How does Pixar do it? Their animation is first rate. The way they can bring life to characters is absolutely unparalleled. That feat is made all the more remarkable here because there is actually very little dialog - at least not between the main characters. All the emotions, communication, and 'humanization' of the robots happens with their eyes, their body language, and their tonal vocalizations. It's stunning to behold.And yet that's not their greatest achievement here. How does Pixar find the best stories time and time again? It's amazing how you can watch all the futuristic sci-fi out there and yet Wall-E may be the most accurately prophetic one out there. Can you not see us in an era where people are so enamored with their smart-phones where they are constantly bumping into each other because they don't see the people around themselves? Even the sports they engage in are virtual - rendering the people into milk-shake eating babies who do as they're told This incredible achievement doesn't just stop there. It's an entertaining tale for the kids as well. They'll like the action scenes. They'll love the robots and how they can interact without words. And the film, dealing with such bleak material, somehow finds a way to have a hopeful ending.10/10",Null,0,1,10 November 2011
X-Men: First Class," the franchise is back
","A lot of people felt that after X2, the franchise was losing steam. X3 was a huge disappointment to some (not to me, it was just a mild disappointment to me). And then the Wolverine movie was good but seemed to be too far apart from the X-Men franchise to be considered part of its 'canon' with character continuity issues between it and the first X-Men movie.Well this one definitely has the storyline, the characters, and the actors to help revive this movie franchise. The casting of the characters for Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr was spot on. Both actors did brilliantly in moving along the main stem of the plot - the introduction, budding friendship, and eventually alienation of the two great mutants of their generation.The effects are very good and yet they don't overwhelm the picture. The picture is still about the humans/mutants, their story lines, and their interactions with each other. It's SciFi with heart and that's the best kind.X-Men: First Class does have some predictable parts to it, such as when the youngsters who take over the story they're bound to get into trouble. And with all these character introductions with attractive young folk, you're always two scenes away from turning it into a teen-age sex comedy superhero style.But the directors and writers are able to veer into that territory without crossing the line. I can't wait for the next one. And ultimately, that's the mark of a great film.9/10",Null,0,1,30 April 2012
Signs," underrated film
","I don't think this film deserved the poor reviews that some gave it. I've only seen 3 of Night Shylaman's films (6th Sense, Unbreakable) and this one is the most sophisticated in my mind in terms of the director manipulating the viewers into seeing and believing what he wants you to believe.This is not Gibson's worst film by any means. If anything he gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character and I think he soft-sells it very well. Joaquin Phoenix also has a similar character to play and he too soft-sells it well. That was probably not an accident as their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in.If you haven't already, see it - and keep an open mind.",Null,298,469,28 July 2005
Cloud Atlas," six twisted plots of twisted fates
","Quite a marvel to look at. The first thirty minutes of Cloud Atlas are confusing as it introduces six different story lines to you. Adding to the confusion is that the story lines all use the same actors (but in different makeup) and that the stories are all in different eras. After piecing together the various story arcs I found myself following and getting interested in it and then suddenly they cut away and it's off to the other story. It's a bit jarring and disorienting and doesn't really work until the end when all the various story climaxes are about to meet at the same time. The acting was quite good all around. Kudos to Hugh Grant for taking on a few roles you'd never see him normally do - without an English accent to boot. Tom Hanks looks like he had fun with his short but memorable role as the author of 'Knuckle Sandwich'. The role of the young musician was very well acted and was a standout for me.Part of the fun and the distraction was trying to recognize the various actors in different costume/makeup in the various scenes. Definitely not a perfect movie by any means but if you can put in the effort in the beginning, the payoff at the end is worth it. 8/10",Null,0,2,21 January 2014
Gangs of New York," wonderful to look at
","the sets, the costumes, the settings. This is a beautiful movie to look at. You feel like you really have dropped in to the middle of an 1800s slum in New York. And boy is it ever gritty. this is the birth pains of America in all its gory. And yes, that is not a typo. This is a brutally violent movie. There are no real heroes above reproach. It's an ugly tale of greed, hatred, bigotry, racism, debauchery, pride, humiliation, and there's no final scene with a redemption.Daniel Day Lewis mesmerizes with his performance. He IS Bill the Butcher. You totally forget he could be anyone else. His Bill is pompous, self-righteous, vile, and yet carries with him a sense of honor, although his definition is definitely twisted.DiCaprio has a harder time making us forget he is a Hollywood A-list actor. But he tries and he does well at times. But once in a while, the camera can't help but showcase his pretty-boy good looks. Even when his hair is greasy and dirty it still looks like a matinée idol 'perfect' kind of dirty. Telling is the scene where he is supposedly scarred for life on the cheek with a red hot knife blade. Yet five minutes later you see his face, almost untouched, as if he was just filming a Dove Soap commercial.Cameron Diaz has a strange un-placeable accent. But she tries and does OK as the street pickpocket. Unfortunately the 'romance' between her and DiCaprio seems very forced and misplaced in this tale. It probably could have done without that at all. Sure, let them sleep together but there should be no love romance about it. This awkward romance is the weakest link in the whole film and probably the source of the poor reviews of Diaz's acting. It's not really her fault. It's the story.The story isn't overly complicated. No twists nor turns. You watch because you know what's going to happen, but you want to see how it happens and what the outcomes affect on the main characters will be.Overall, 7/10.",Null,0,0,21 February 2012
Valkyrie," much better than expected
","I didn't pay much attention when this came out in theatres. The entertainment media kept calling it a 'troubled' production and there was the usual skewering of Tom Cruise because of his religion, erratic behaviour, etc. But if you just put all that nonsense aside and watch the movie you'll see a well crafted, well acted film.Based on the true story of the German resistance and their last recorded attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler it proves to be quite thrilling. At first the movie seems to be a Tom Cruise vehicle with every shot highlighting the star's ever move. But as the film progresses it becomes more about the plot, the various things that 'could' go wrong and did.Kenneth Branagh is hardly in the film but he gets shown in the promotional posters. He plays his tiny part really well. Watch his facial expressions as he sits uncomfortably in the military office, wondering whether or not his secret has been revealed. It's an awesome piece of acting.Cruise is a lot more limited in his range. You can recognize his various looks from far away including his 'determined' face, his 'giving orders' face, and his 'struggling with something' face. The role allows him to show all that. His performance is adequate but pales next to his costars.Great pacing, decent plot (surprisingly much of it really happened as it appears in the film) and great performances by all the supporting cast along with a decent performance by Tom Cruise.8/10",Null,0,0,11 March 2011
Up in the Air," Overrated dramedy - spends too much time 'up in the air'
","It's tricky to make these 'Dramedies' - part drama, part comedy. You either have a lot of humorous but not funny incidents that don't get enough laughs. Or you don't get your audience fully engaged in the storyline or characters and they wonder where the drama fits in.For me this movie unfortunately fit both descriptions; neither funny nor dramatic. The plot is wafer thin. It's the recession, people are getting laid off everywhere. So why not outsource the firings and have a bunch of professionals flying around the country telling people they've been let go. It's a very dark premise and given today's situation, perhaps one that hits too close to home. So immediately, for much of the audience, you've probably lost a lot of the intended comedic irony from that situation.then you have the characters. None of them is particularly 'like-able'. Clooney is a 'character' but not one who is charming nor engaging. His character is meant to be trying to distance himself from others, but again, his success in portraying that is a detriment to the audience actually getting connected to his character. So he fails for being successful. Anna Kendrick, the young go-getter is primed to fill that void as the film's heroine but her project - firing people by webcam to save the company money, also reeks of insensitivity, or at best naivety. And Vera Farmigiana, well, she looks good in a tight black dress.And there you have it. The funny scenes are more 'droll' than funny. You get it. It's humorous. But it's definitely not 'laugh out loud' funny.the characters are hollow, empty, and floating away on a sea of misery, largely of their own making.4/10 - I've watched it once. And that's enough.",Null,2,3,22 February 2011
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," humorous, but not overly funny
","It was a nicely shot movie with a definite feel for the era. But the storyline left something to the imagination. Many nods to the source material (Homer's Odyssey) but the original made the adventures much more thrilling whereas in this movie it just seemed to be a bunch of random events strung together.Clooney was OK but the best character had to be his short sidekick. John Goodman's role is actually quite small. Holly Hunter, another top billed actor in this movie has a role that's even smaller. Overall I found it mildly amusing, mildly entertaining and therefore only mildly recommended.",Null,0,1,14 December 2008
