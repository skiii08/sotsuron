Ford v Ferrari," The film studio behind this flick does a great job . . .
",". . . in graphically documenting another sad chapter in the saga of America's Most Fiendish Family. Edsel's whelp (Hank #2) stands in as FORD V FERRARI's most hiss-worthy villain, as he viciously drives beloved World Racing Champ 'Ken' to a premature, fiery death in a faulty Ford car. Perhaps it's a wise decision by the filmmakers to forego a prologue showing Hank #1's gun thugs patrolling the world's first auto assembly lines, with orders to shoot any workers who dare talk to each other. Maybe it would be beside the point to depict members of this Corrupt Corporate Fat Cat Family chilling with Der Fuhrer, and providing technical support for the latter's infamous Blitzkrieg. Possibly it would be too much of a tangent to incorporate references to Edsel's Revenge, when Hank One's favorite son was NOT given a starting spot by the Detroit Lions, prompting this petty grudge-bearing conniving clan to BUY the team with the intention of making it the focus of national derision forever. However, what FORD V FERRARI actually DOES put up on the screen should be enough to convince anyone (beyond the demonically-possessed ditto-head Pachyderm core supporters) NEVER to get behind the wheel of a fraudulent Ford!",8,3,7,20 November 2019
The Lobster," LOBSTER picks up right where WALRUS (a.k.a., TUSK) left off . . .
",". . . in our increasingly anthropomorphic Society ('They're animals--just animals,' to quote President-elect Trump). Imagine cramming all six seasons of LOST into a couple (admittedly commercial free) hours, and you get a pretty good idea of what LOBSTER is like. Exposition is kept to a minimum, as viewers are required to fill in an EXPENDABLES-outing worth of blanks for themselves. As best as I can make out, LOBSTER is meant to forecast America's Future under Trump Rules. These are a little bit more Fascist than CIDER HOUSE RULES, but probably something happened--like 50 shot dead in a Gay nightclub--which required The Authorities to adopt harsher measures than those championed by Bill, Hillary, and King Harald V. Apart from politics, LOBSTER is full of fascinating facts about Nature. Did you know that the title critter here has blue blood? I sure don't remember them that way, when I was forced to go on an annual cruise in Boston Harbor with all-you-can-eat lobster for a previous job. I guess you learn something new every movie.",9,0,3,13 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Warner Bros. courageously battles the Insidious Sony MegaCorp . . .
",". . . throughout BLADE RUNNER 2049. Though this sort of 'Inside Baseball' cinematic warfare has resulted in a fairly schizophrenic film, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is still chock full of the sort of prophetic Portents of Real Life Doom comfortably familiar to all of We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Citizens. Many of BLADE RUNNER 2049's trademark Warner Bros. warnings could be ripped from Today's Headlines. In fact, on the day that I saw 2049 (Monday, October 9, 2017) Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin's U.S. Environmental Pollution Agency Czar, Scott 'Just Ruin It' Pruitt, condemned 375,000 of our Asthmatic Fellow Americans to Excruciating Early Deaths by giving Big Coal a Carte Blanche to turn our once 'Beautiful, for Spacious Skies' totally Black, just as they are pictured throughout Warner's half of this flick. Sony's 50% of BLADE RUNNER is full of crass product placement and corrupt job-killing automation, in keeping with their Mission--as the official Propaganda Arm of the Japanese Government--to destroy all the American Values that they can.It will go without saying for many if not most Americans that Sony is closely allied with Putin's Stevie Repug Party, aka the GOOPERs, led by Steve Bannon and the late Steve Paddock (commonly referred to as the Deplorable Machinegun Cult). Certified, card-carrying Satanists in Real Life, these murderous miscreants are referred to by Warner as 'Replicants' during BLADE RUNNER 2049. This is done to distinguish these Groupthinking Automatons from We Flesh and Blood Human Beings. The soul-less Replicants rule over LA LA LAND, as actor Ryan Gosling frequently manages to remind us by plunking various derelict pianos. The climax of Warner's Las Vegas half of BLADE RUNNER 2049 involves high-rise windows being shot out, no doubt Warner's way of alerting Real Life Sin City Concert Goers to Beware of Repug Replicant Steve Paddock. Unfortunately, Sony's team of deplorable Fifth Columnist Traitors spilled the beans of this mass market caution to Replicant Shooter Paddock, who moved up his hotel reservations for Another Day of Infamy. Those familiar with that Ancient Greek Oracle Cassandra might call this turn of events Deja Vu All Over Again, but if you're Warner Bros., what more can you do?",7,2,8,10 October 2017
First Man," This is by far the scariest movie . . .
",". . . that Universal's 'House of Horror' has ever made (and I've seen most of them, from the silent HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA right through weeks of DRACVLA, FRANKENSTEIN, MUMMY, WOLF MAN, INVISIBLE MAN, and CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON flicks). Every moment of FIRST MAN is fraught with Terror, from the opening scene of 'Neil's' X-15 bouncing into Outer Space to the closing pathos of he and his wife unable to articulate a thought in the vast emptiness of their moon-visitor Quarantine Room. ('Ripley' enjoys a picnic during ALIEN compared to Mrs. Armstrong's suffering throughout FIRST MOON.) The ominous hollow clanking and grinding noises of U.S. rocket ships both BEFORE and after launch sound like the TITANIC breaking in half, and the fact that something always goes wrong--often with deadly results--every time an American astronaut goes to work no doubt prompted Real Life SIRENS OF TITAN author Kurt Vonnegut to demand that the U.S. Space Program cease and desist (in a clip from a TV interview) included during FIRST MAN. As Colonel Kurtz would say, 'The Horror! The Horror!!'",10,1,4,29 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," 'If you build it . . . '
","' . . . THEY will come,' Hollywood teaches the main tenet of Quantum Physics' String Theory in 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE. People say even a broken clock is right twice a day, and 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE suggests that every paranoid schizophrenic psychotic serial killer is reigning as a One-Eyed King in some Land of the Blind. When I lived near New Orleans in Tangipahoa Parish, folks like John Goodman's 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE character 'Howard' were a dime a dozen. Certainly The Crescent City will be Ground Zero for most Alien Invasions, and any shape-shifting chameleon-like Extraterrestials will come to us in the guise of someone like Howard (obviously, intended to pay homage here to HOWARD THE DUCK). The religion of Karma contends that you reap what you sow, and your chickens eventually come home to roost in the form of Bad Karma. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE shows what kind of just desserts a chick gets from running out on Bradley Cooper (who poignantly plays the voice of 'Ben' in this story).",8,1,5,13 March 2016
The Finest Hours," Disney asks, 'Are you a Man, or are you a Minnie?' . . .
",". . . with its latest unnecessarily-3D flick, THE FINEST HOURS. Though this True Story takes place in 1951-1952, Disney makes clear that it is targeting the 21st Century chick with 'Miriam,' by having HER propose to the tale's hero. According to THE FINEST HOURS, women think with their Hearts--NOT their Heads. Disney proves that if it were up to Miriam, the 32 survivors of the oil tanker Pendleton all would have drowned. If THE FINEST HOURS bunch had made GONE WITH THE WIND, that yawner would have been 2 1/2 hours shorter, because Mrs. Lincoln would have commanded Abe NOT to contest the Rebels or their Lazy Plantation 'Colonels'' Racist Black Slavery System. (Of course, Mrs. Smith would be too busy picking cotton nowadays to raise any Oscar ruckus, had women like Abe's Mary Todd and THE FINEST HOURS' Miriam been able to successfully influence their men.) With its FINEST HOURS, Disney is telling America NOT to be hasty in electing a Woman President. 'View THIRTEEN HOURS first, America, before casting your ballots,' might as well be Disney's 'Tag-Line' for THE FINEST HOURS.",8,0,6,1 February 2016
Child 44," CHILD 44 portrays Russia as a land of . . .
",". . . murderous liars, where Life is Cheap, Death lies around every corner, and the slain may be considered 'lucky' to be out of their misery. (But not as fortunate as they would have been if they were born in, say, Finland in the first place.) If you diagnose Russia's national character during the last couple Millenia of its recorded history, 'paranoid schizophrenic' would be spot on, and CHILD 44 provides ample evidence for such a conclusion. At the end of CHILD 44, the surviving cast members make a lame attempt to blame everything on Hitler. But anyone familiar with the few thousand years preceding the Third Reich's Russian foray understands that 'Der Fuhrer' was no match for the Pure Evil that is Russia. Viewers of CHILD 44 may form their own theory, as the movie implies that Mother Russia got knocked up by a Demon to get the whole shebang going (but the jury's probably still out on that one).",9,20,56,20 April 2015
Deepwater Horizon," This flick makes the case for a permanent total ban . . .
",". . . on ANY oil or gas extraction operations in America's coastal waters. The callous incompetent buffoons pictured here in DEEPWATER HORIZON murdered at least 650 dolphin people (which would constitute 3% or 80 million human deaths when extrapolated to Planet Earth's bloated human population). Since DEEPWATER, dolphin miscarriages are up 1,000%! Any poor baby dolphins which survive being born need to painfully struggle for each breath of their shortened lives, thanks to DEEPWATER. Because DEEPWATER decimated 8,332 species altogether, it will take experts hundreds of books to document all this carnage. (This movie glosses over this Holocaust among the Creatures God gave Man stewardship of by depicting a single dead pelican!) DEEPWATER HORIZON admits that the title ship had 390 broken systems the night of the disaster, April 20, 2010 (just after the 98th anniversary of the Titanic sinking)! Yet instead of chewing their fingernails, the crew was too busy partying and handing themselves safety awards! When ship personnel should have been heeding multiple warning alarms sounding among the few systems left working, they dismissed these as 'false positives' to help their kids with homework, discuss car repairs, or conduct long-distance 'pillow talk,' DEEPWATER HORIZON testifies. Though Gulf sharks--considered the cockroaches of the seas--were able to enjoy about a dozen crispy critters, the overall effects of the DEEPWATER HORIZON Apocalypse call for an $100,000 environmental surcharge on the type of monster Toyota pick-up truck driven by Mark Wahlberg's family, for no apparent reason when a Chevy Cruz would meet all their needs. Better yet, follow the federal government cash-for-clunkers program of a few years ago, and give drivers $5,000 vouchers good toward the purchase of a Chevy Malibu during the mandatory cementing of their gas-guzzling SUV, Minivan, Crossover, and Pick-up engines. While we're at it, DEEPWATER HORIZON suggests that Semitruck and Private Jetliner traffic must be given a compulsory time-out until all such engines are replaced with solar, battery, or steam power. Scientists have envisioned an alternate Steam Punk Reality for Humanity during recent years. DEEPWATER HORIZON proves it is High Time to make these Visions our actual Future!",8,1,2,4 October 2016
It," Warner Bros. hired contractors to deftly rewrite IT . . .
",". . . to Perfectly Allegorize the Deplorable Conditions in Current Day America. Filmed in Canada to minimize interference from the treasonous Putin Administration now infesting the swamps in Washington, DC, IT depicts the Squalid, God-Forsaken Reality of an American Empire on its knees, emphasizing the Fetid Pipelines sprouting up under Putin's Environmental Pollution Agency Tsar Scott 'Just Ruin It' Pruitt, the brain-dead generation of USA children lobotomized by Putin's Billionairess 'For-Profit' Charter Brain-Washing Chain Secretary of Miseducation Betsy 'Amway Calling' DeVos, and the Pacebo-based PutinCare Regime being foisted upon Americans by Ill-Health Secretary Tom 'The Price is Wrong!' Warner suggests that since the Red Commie KGB pawns supporting Putin's Putsch possess most of America's guns, We the True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Progressive Union Label Citizens--represented here by Bill, Ben, Beverly, Mike, Richie, and Eddie--MUST take out these Fifth Columnist Quisling Putin Miscreants by Any Means Necessary, including nap-time attacks with switch-blades to the neck and bashing out brains with ambush cudgelings launched from behind shower curtains. Warner warns us that this is likely to be a long, slow slog, since they label their revised flick as 'IT: Chapter One.'",8,4,10,12 September 2017
If I Stay," 'I want this to be over!' Mia shouts . . .
",". . . after one hour, eighteen minutes, and fifteen seconds of screen time mostly spent staring at her comatose self Shilly-Shallying between Life and Death in a hospital bed. If my showing is any indication, this is a VERY dangerous 'date flick.' Two or three guys walked out on this film after hearing Mia's Complaint, one of them muttering to his female companion, 'Some day 'cello gal' might decide to stay, but I'M splitting now!' If nothing else, this movie will make hospital visitors think twice BEFORE giving loved ones 'permission' to croak. IF I STAY's hero is awarded brownie points for introducing his musical prodigy protégé (pre-stupor) to teenage intercourse and alcohol abuse, despite America's prevalent statutory rape and zero-tolerance laws. Of course, in Real Life such 'younger but wiser' girls do NOT live happily-ever-after at prestigious art schools. Rather, after fighting with their lover they attain three times the ADULT legal alcohol limit, jump into their Cobalt with an unbuckled seat belt, and speed 67 m.p.h. down their 15 m.p.h. Cul De Sac before dying instantly at the hands of a maple tree. Then a celebrity mediator orders GM to pay their single mom $2 million for being such an attentive parent (posthumously, of course; this amount will buy lots of Kleenex). But IF I STAY was filmed in Canada, where apparently they've never heard of Real Life.",6,1,4,26 August 2014
A Star Is Born," Before our Sun dies, it will expand, burning Earth . . .
",". . . to a tiny black cinder, as it 'Goes out with a bang,' the always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America with A STAR IS BORN. More so than the earlier three versions of this story, the 'D.B. Cooper' take on A STAR IS BORN is primarily about A Star Dying. His 'Jackson Mayne' character already is on his last legs, with at least one foot in the grave, before he ever sets eyes upon 'Lady Maggot.' Though it may seem that the worm turns then on a superficial level as Jackson wraps frozen peas around Maggot's bruised hand, perceptive viewers will note that he's actually beginning his Super Nova-like expansion phase, bathing all around him with the fire of a funeral pyre. Maggot feeds off the doomed Jackson until she's drained the last succulent drop of his tender bone marrow, and then kicks off into her own new orbit without a second thought. As the movie closes with a close-up of her eyes, it's clear that she senses that her time to shine will end soon.",8,1,2,23 October 2018
Fury," Even though many of those involved with FURY are Americans . . .
",". . . it's still as if some 'fair and balanced' world version of Fox News is behind its revisionist 'history.' Everyone knows that the biggest name connected to FURY, Brad Pitt, fancies himself a One Worlder now. But FURY could have earned a rating of '10,' like Warner Brothers' LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, if its distributors had exercised their prerogative of editorial oversight. No such luck here. Japan's Sony Corporation continued its assault on American Values with FURY, which is no surprise when you consider that Sony's Japan was Hitler's Best Friend. So rather than a manly frontal attack, FURY tries to bamboozle those too young to remember Tojo with dozens of sneaky slights to America peppered throughout its long 134-minute duration. Flattering pictures of Germany's dictator, Adolf Hitler, pop up here, there, and everywhere; not even one photo of America's beloved WWII leader, FDR, is in sight. Wounded G.I.s shoot themselves in the head, rather than sticking it out till the medics arrive. Newbies are forced to violate the rules of war by gunning down unarmed German P.O.W.s, as sort of the second step in gang initiation (Step One being slopping up the face of their predecessor into a bucket). Adding insult to injury, German Nazis are shown WINNING the tank named FURY's final battle! With all the Japanese and German cars on our U.S. highways today, it's not surprising that many American high schoolers think that WE lost WWII! Who could blame them, with untruthful spectacles such as FURY in our Megaplexes?",7,0,3,25 November 2014
Darkest Hour," Humanity was on the verge of caving in to Hitler in 1940 . . .
",". . . DARKEST HOUR deftly documents. England was rife with Fascist Gestapo Nazi Fellow Travelers such as Neville Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax, DARKEST HOUR recounts. Even King George VI--current monarch Liz the Second's Pops--sat on the fence, seriously considering whether to defect to Canada to avoid a firing squad A La Czar Nicholas. Were it not for a common secretary and a random collection of True Blue Loyal Patriotic Average Normal 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label 'Little People' donating a transfusion of backbone to Winston Churchill in Civilization's DARKEST HOUR, the Corrupt 'Conservative' Corporate Fat Cats would have embraced Hitler in a New York minute, and we'd all STILL be living under the 'Third Reich.' Except for the Jews, of course--cowards such as Chamberlain and Halifax would have been sure to round up the OTHER six million Sons of David who survived World War Two for Their Fuhrer. Gone, too, would be the Gays, the Gypsies, the Mentally Challenged, the Physically Infirm, the Poor, the People of Color, the Liberals, the Socialists, the Free-Thinkers, the Press--pretty much the same Hit List of Usual Suspects currently endangered by Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin, and his White House Sock Puppet, Don Juan Rump. The latter just announced this week that he's going to have Devil's Tower strip-mined by America's Big Coal Oligarchs. This is the U.S. National Monument that Rump's fellow serial sex offender, Richard Dreyfuss, was building out of mashed potatoes in the middle of Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," As one of the eight Americans versed in both STAR WARS . . .
",". . . and the content of the late-night radio broadcast COAST-TO-COAST (two Universes which have NEVER mentioned each other!), an individual feels a Great Responsibility to highlight the point at which these Alternate Realities intersect. When a Rebel leader complains during ROGUE ONE that his group is 'an Alliance, NOT a Suicide Pact,' the obvious reference is to that part of the U.S. Constitution embedded by Racist American Southerners to insure that Our Nation implodes, diverting control to a White European Strongman, if Blacks ever reach the Acme of Power (as did the Obamas). The U.S. 'Electoral College' IS a 'Suicide Pact,' designed to put someone such as a misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, chauvinist casino-frittering, serial finger rapist, tax-dodging, womanizing, Emmy-losing TV Game Show Host beholden for billions of dollars to the loan sharks of Nuclear Russia's Death Star into our White House. COAST-TO-COAST has announced that their primarily-'Prepper' listening audience has mere days to be stocked up to the gills with Survival Supplies, as 'President' Rump intends on letting his Red Commie KGB Puppetmaster Vlad 'Mad Dog' Putin take down our Power\Communication\Water\Sewer\Banking grid with six EMP nuclear blasts and then 'behead' our Military with thousands of warheads which will kill millions of Americans in Uniform as Rump and his Cabinet of Deplorables cower in a bunker.

Passengers," The economics of space colonization . . .

Jennifer Lawrence, as journalist 'Aurora Lane,' estimates during PASSENGERS that America's first colonized planet boosted our Gross National Product (GNP) by $8 quadrillion (that is, by about 8,000,000,000,000,000 bucks), which is more than enough to upgrade our nuclear weapons arsenal while also fully funding ObamaCare, not to mention fixing our infrastructure by replacing every lead water pipe with gold and repaving every mile of our Interstate Highways with Titanium. As a side benefit, most of these New Earths Colonists will be bored Rich People, according to PASSENGERS. Just think how much better off America will be when the sort of billionaire bozos making up White House Resident-Elect Rump's Cabinet are instead put into 'Hibernation' for 249 of the next 250 years, so that they can spend the remaining 12 months touring a Planet Far Far Away.

Apparently, the Evil White Sheep are jealous of the Predators' generally Bigger Size, and their many positions of social prominence. Consequently, the Devious White Sheep come up with a plot to poison the Predators with covert Steroid-like injections, causing symptoms similar to 'Roid Rage.

Whether it's starting to nibble on an opponent in the boxing ring, beating or cheating or beheading the Predator's White Sheep spouse, or sexually assaulting a Predator Miss Zootopia, the secret injections begin to give Predators a Bad Name.

The Danish Girl," Someone said 'there's nothing new under the sun . . . '
",". . . but they were dead wrong. History tells us that the classic Greek armies had no need for a 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Policy, because they were all doing each other like rabbits (with NO protection, to boot!). Speaking of the Greeks, they ran the first several centuries of Olympic Games. Yet there is not a single recorded case from Greek Antiquity of either AIDS or an Olympic Champion switching to the Women's Division four years later. So, with Magic Johnson and the athlete once known as 'Bruce Jenner' (among others) proving that there actually ARE new things soaking up sunlight, Rational People cannot help but begin looking for Cause\Effect Relationships. As they said in GOODBYE, COLUMBUS, the key might be summed up in one word: 'Plastics.' The DANISH GIRL presents its 'Lily' as Ground Zero's Patient #1 for its so-called 'Transgender Movement.' Though it's not spelled out whether Lily was one of Humanity's first babies to be bottle-fed through some sort of plastic (or otherwise artificial) nozzle, Lily's final memory is of being held by her mom in a nursing position. (Of course, we also don't know if Mr.\Ms. Jenner was brought up with BHA-containing bottles.) As with AIDS, Ebola, Bird Flu, and other Modern Pandemics, The Transgender Movement may seem tiny now, but a tipping point will come if and when it has infected even a quarter of Earth's Population. That's why ALL plastics (and probably most other chemicals) MUST be banned immediately! It may be too late to save THE DANISH GIRL, but let's try to salvage the rest of us!",8,1,2,19 January 2016
Little Boy," In a clever allegory promoting nuclear warfare . . .
",". . . the title character LITTLE BOY is conflated with the real-life bomb bearing that code name, which instantly vaporized some 80,000 mostly civilian Japanese folks on August 6, 1945. (Note that if Sony Corporation had its hooks into ALL U.S. theater chains, this flick would have been seen by even FEWER people than was THE INTERVIEW.) One hour, 13 minutes, and 45 seconds into LITTLE BOY, this film's soundtrack joyfully blares the Sunday School standard 'This Little Light of Mine' while archival footage of Hiroshima's apocalyptic Death Cloud brightens the screen! (This may be the first documented and totally overt 'Nukes for Jesus' message EVER conveyed by American mass media.) To hammer this point home, 39-inch-small LITTLE BOY next pictures HIMSELF as his namesake Nuclear Holocaust Capsule, standing as the ONLY human alive deep in Hiroshima's Ground Zero Crater! The not-so-subtle main message here is that LITTLE BOY's daddy only survives WWII because of the A-Bombs. LITTLE BOY's implicit argument is that America has lost Her way since 1945, and MUST revert to nuclear Revenge & Deterrence forays into world trouble spots such as Iran, Russia, North Korea, and China to regain Her stature as God's Annointed Holy Nation. The rest of this movie is carefully constructed to teach LEGAL immigrants about the proper way to live in America. Mr. Yashimoto is NOT accepted until ALL of his cultural keepsakes (and traditions) are stomped to bits in the dust. LITTLE BOY is yelling to the barrio, 'Forget May 5, Quincineras, and piñatas--gorge on Fourth of July hot dogs instead!",8,5,10,16 May 2015
Point Break," Warner Bros. documents that FBI agents make the best stone-cold . . .
",". . . killers. When Warner's James Cagney ran out of murder targets in THE PUBLIC ENEMY, the movie studio simply made him the star and one of the title characters of G-MEN, so he could use his taxpayer-funded license to kill to become an even more prolific man-slayer. In Warner's recent BLACK MASS, all of the many cold-blooded assassinations were performed, or aided and abetted by FBI agents (as was the case in Real Life Boston). Now Warner's POINT BREAK brings to life the story of FBI Agent 'Utah's' Training Month, during which he becomes a particularly sadistic serial killer, infiltrating a group of environmental activists so he can get his jollies by performing Extreme Sports on their dime as he picks the more talented quintet off one-by-one. He even has intercourse with the lone female in the bunch (not unlike a cat 'playing' with its prey before eating it alive). Then, of course, he gives 'necking' an FBI Re-definition by fatally shooting his one-night stand in her neck. When you become friends and/or lovers with an FBI agent, your minutes are surely numbered, POINT BREAK and Warner Bros. illustrate here.",8,2,8,29 December 2015
Creed," There really isn't any reason why we cannot have . . .
",". . . a Second Coming of CREED. For one thing, Adonis Creed 'Donnie' Johnson is still alive at the end of CREED I. Secondly, his geriatric trainer Rocky Balboa has risen from his death bed to remain in the picture here through the final fight. Though many critics believe that Sylvester Stallone's dialect always has been somewhat akin to an Italian geezer recovering from a stroke, there are plenty of other old folks maladies left to endanger the Rocky Balboa character, without forcing Mr. Stallone to attempt the Herculean acting height of portraying what would essentially be a stroke victim squared. The erstwhile Rambo actor has attained the Real Life age where bouts with influenza are frequently fatal; 'Can Creed cream corny pugs as Rocky fights flu?' sounds like a ready-made tag-line for the next CREED offering. This would give the scriptwriters an opportunity to have Mr. Adonis bellow out 'Bianca, Bianca!' at the end of a tussle (which could become as memorable as a Mum-Yelled 'Adrian!' by the original Rocky).",9,1,4,3 December 2015
Spotlight," SPOTLIGHT proves that Donald Trump's wrong . . .
",". . . about WHICH group to ban from entering America because they're prone to be terrorists. The Romans are documented to be 10 times more insidious and successful in terrorizing our Homeland than Trump's scapegoat Muslims (a.k.a., 'the usual suspects') in SPOTLIGHT. Half of ALL Roman priests ignore their 'sacred' obligatory celibacy vows to enjoy sexual intercourse, SPOTLIGHT shows, and between 6% and 18% are sexually abusing defenseless young children (the lower figure is given early in the film, but the higher ratio is used right at the close, when more facts are in). The end credits for SPOTLIGHT itemize that nearly EVERY major city of the 'Western World' as being corrupted by this plague of ecclesiastical terrorism, 99% of which STILL is being swept under Rome's rug. Boston (a.k.a., 'The Devil's Playground,' as documented earlier this year in BLACKMASS) is Ground Zero for America's nefarious malignant cancer, SPOTLIGHT illustrates. This flick suggests that the Roman cabal conspirators tried to quash the scandal from becoming widely known to the Public by using its pawns at Boston's Logan Airport and their Roman counterparts in New York to usher the 9-11 hijackers onto four airliners (in an effort--so far successful with Trump and many other benighted Americans--to divert attention from the REAL domestic terror threat ripping the fabric of U.S. civilization). Joe Paterno's statue at Penn State was bulldozed because he was thought to be two or three steps removed from a one-man child sex abuse 'ring.' By this Paterno Statue logic, the time is way overdue to bulldoze EVERY Roman edifice where such abuse enablers have been housed, starting with the one-time tower of Child Rape Kingpin Cardinal Bernard Law's hideout in Boston itself. The heavy-duty work involved in razing these thousands of blots upon America's conscience through the power of 'eminent domain' and replacing these Sex Abuser Havens (usually occupying prime downtown real estate) with appropriate development which actually benefits society will create 1.8 million new U.S. jobs, and grow our economy an additional 1.1% annually for the next five years! Act now toward a solution to the USA's #1 Terrorist Threat, urges SPOTLIGHT. Otherwise, you're part of the problem.",10,3,7,9 December 2015
Aquaman," Next time you thoughtlessly toss a plastic drinking straw . . .

For many decades Warner's prophetic prognosticators have warned Earthlings about their upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. AQUAMAN is one of Warner's most urgent such warnings in the History of Time, as it deals with 'the Wrath of the Seven Seas' being unleashed upon you land lubbers. Warner's clairvoyant seers predict Dire Consequences if you insist upon bagging your groceries with disposable sacks or gulping your fluids from plastic water bottles and Styrofoam coffee cups. Cigarette butts, loose beer can tabs, indestructible six-pack rings, medical waste, worn-out vehicle tires, rusty shipping containers, and 'moth-balled' fleets are among some of the most egregious environmental excesses sure to draw Poseidon's Wrath, AQUAMAN cautions.

Concussion," The hits just keep on coming . . .
",". . . from Japan's Sony Corp. against America. Japan's latest assault on American Values, CONCUSSION, is particularly insidious, being so well acted, edited, and paced that it merits a rating of '9' as a product of world cinema. However, any True Blue American would give CONCUSSION a mark of '2' at best, since it besmirches our current National Religion, NFL Football (which, as CONCUSSION emphasizes, has stolen the ownership of American Sundays from their long-time possessor, Christianity). CONCUSSION's bottom line is that 28% of NFL players will die young of the CTE brain condition that Will Smith discovers during this movie. C'Mon, folks, do the math: Even IF that's true, the remaining two-thirds of Pro Bowlers won't get Alzheimer's until they're in their 80s, like Bart Starr! More importantly, without PeeWee, Middle and High School, and College Football, America would surely lose at least half of its professional Servicemen (All-Girl Army, anybody?) and Police Officers. So football is the main thing keeping Lawless Chaos from over-taking the United States, and CONCUSSION is no less of a sneak attack by Japan on America (in the form of corporate warfare) than Pearl Harbor was (in a military sense)!",9,4,11,6 January 2016
Youth," Some of the reasons that YOUTH is better than REVENANT . . .
",". . . are that 'Melanie Ballinger' is far scarier than any Gentle Ben grizzly bear, and Jane Fonda comes awful close to upstaging Leo's bruin in the fright department herself, not to mention Harvey Keitel and Paul Dano. When 'Hitler' places as just the fourth creepiest character in a flick, you know that that picture has a lot going for it. Ask yourself this, as well: Did REVENANT feature a well-endowed full-frontal Miss Universe? Or a command performance of a haunting tune for the Queen? Or a dozen amazing live acts on a turntable? Or cow symphonies? Or a Daddy\Daughter nightmare-in-bed scene? Or violin lessons? Or massage tables where happy endings are not foregone conclusions? Or existential fights for survival where the combatants are fresh and clean, NOT scruffy and infested? Or a dying fat man able to volley a tennis ball off his ankle? Or one intriguing mystery after another to keep you guessing? Or breath-taking strolls through the Swiss Alps? Is REVENANT really anything more than a tedious slog through the swamps of Yesteryear?",10,4,8,19 January 2016

READY PLAYER ONE is carefully crafted to outline the sort of secretive plotting that will be necessary for we True Blue Loyal Patriotic Progressive Union Label Citizens to Carpe Diem. Most of the action of READY PLAYER ONE is set in Columbus, Ohio.

The Hateful Eight," This STAGECOACH remake really rocks . . .
",". . . as writer\director Quentin Tarantino exposes the True Essence of Real Life Menaces John Ford, John Wayne, and the rest of their gang of UnAmerican Fascist Thugs--all while making a highly enjoyable picture twice as good and four times as funny as the over-rated 1939 original. Though the mendacious and ruinously harmful GONE WITH THE WIND (inspirer of countless Real Life lynchings in the decades following its release) hosed THE WIZARD OF OZ for the Best Picture Oscar in the Year of Hitler ('39), Mr. Tarantino also goes a long way toward avenging American cinema for the racist travesty GWTW was with one of the longest passages of reverse racism ever to play on the screens of U.S. Multiplexes. John Wayne movies always promoted violence by reducing death-by-gunfire to a spot of ketchup on a victim's shirt. Conversely, Mr. Tarantino is the National Rifle Association's worst nightmare, since most of his flicks show parents exactly how their kids will end up looking when there are guns in a home; it ain't a pretty sight!",9,1,17,5 January 2016
Molly's Game," 'I felt like I was in a hole so deep . . . '
","' . . . I could go fracking,' MOLLY'S GAME title character Molly Bloom says toward the end of her 10-year psychological research project into the World of Fat Cat Men leeching the lifeblood from America's Homeland. Jessica Chastain proves that the home-grown threat that these Good Ol' Boys pose to the USA's long-term well-being is far greater than that of some over-rated Bearded Bozo hiding in a cave such as Osama Bin Laden, whom Jessica helped to rub out a few years back in ZERO DARK THIRTY. The socially-worthless money hoarders Chastain ferrets out during MOLLY'S GAME have perverted America's entire legal system to give themselves a Carte Blanche to produce the greatest large-scale inequality of wealth in human history, this flick documents. MOLLY'S GAME shows that even when these demonic clowns are NOT poking a revolver down someone's throat, they might as well be. Clearly, their greedy, grasping, gratuitous 'life-style' as illustrated during MOLLY'S GAME is a 'luxury' America call ill afford, liable to snatch Medicaid, Social Security, ObamaCare, VA Hospitals, Medicare, and all other touches of Humanity from We 99 Per Centers any day now!",10,2,5,5 January 2018
Black Mass," It's easy to connect the dots between the Bosox, Patriots, and the . . .
",". . . Cradle of Corruption, a.k.a., Boston, MA, after viewing BLACK MASS. Known as Satan's Playground since its suburban Salem witch & warlock days of the 1600s, BLACK MASS documents how James 'Whitey' Bulger is one of the Devil's top Earthly minions, exporting his Evil Deeds to places as far-flung as Tulsa, Miami, and Ireland. In the 1900s, America's original 'Title Town' sports capital was Detroit, MI. But now, as the Tigers and Lions languish, Bostonians Lord it over the rest of us with three World Series wins and umpteen Deflategators' triumphs in this End Times Century. Anyone who watched those eight-hour games between the Bosox and the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series could see plainly that 'the fix was in.' The bribed umpires gave the Bosox an average of four outs per inning, while finding some flimsy excuse to nullify most of the Yankee hits and runs. It STILL took an eternity for the lesser team, famously cursed by the Bambino, to 'win.' This is foretold 89 minutes, 20 seconds into BLACK MASS when Bulger's pet FBI-agent-turned-convicted-murderer John Connolly tries to bribe the incorruptible non-Bostonian federal prosecutor with Bosox tickets to a game in which the infamous Curt Schilling is pitching. 'Boston Strong' sounds like one of Voldemort's mottoes from Harry Potter, when viewed in the context of BLACK MASS. Thanks to this movie, we have proof positive that Bulger is STILL corrupting America's sports scene from his prison cell with his Parseltongue messages to henchmen such as MLB umps, Schilling, NFL refs, and Tom Brady.",10,0,3,16 October 2015
Suicide Squad," Warner Bros. may not come right out and endorse . . .

Donald Trump as our next U.S. President in SUICIDE SQUAD, but this feature's mid-credits final scene between Hillary Clinton's stand-in 'Amanda Waller' (played by a scary Viola Davis) and Ben Affleck as Gotham City Tycoon Bruce Wayne, a.k.a., Batman, a.k.a. New York City Tycoon Trump, indicates--as the Trumpster keeps telling us--that Hillary/Viola MUST be stopped, one way if not another. Warner shows us that Hillary/Viola can easily fall prey to the Forces of Evil. (When her Emails are compromised, she just shoots her IT people in the head!) Trump echoed Warner's warning this week when he revealed that Hillary founded the dread terror SUICIDE SQUAD known as ISIS. During the course of this movie version of SUICIDE SQUAD, Hillary's alter ego--'The Witch'--turns the citizens of Midway City into some sort of mindless cancerous zombie army, which can only be stopped when Will Smith shoots them in the head (before they can reach the voting booths). But even Warner's SUICIDE SQUAD has a tough time contending with Hillary/Viola's Evil Witch powers: only Trump/Batman is immune to them, and available to save America's bacon!",8,2,6,11 August 2016
Battleship Potemkin," This flick is set BEFORE the Corrupt Job-killing Commies merged . . .
",". . . with the Corrupt Job-killing Capitalists, sending Civilization down the Road of Perdition with a couple 'World Wars,' countless other conflicts, the Great Depression, the Holocaust, and rampant Global Warming. The heroes of BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN never set themselves up as Fat Cat One Per Centers, along the lines of Lenin, Hoover, Stalin, Rockefeller, Mao, Buffet, and Putin. All they want is maggot-free meat after a hard day's work. But just as the duplicitous honchos of Ronnie 'The Gypper' Reagan's American Administration declared maggots to be suitable condiments for the USA's public school lunch population, POTEMKIN director Sergei Eisenstein accurately depicts these Death Worms as an impending staple of the Red Commie Oligarchical Fat Cat Paradise. While Putin and his fellow Trillionaires chow down on cake and caviar, Russia's 99 Per Centers are reduced to a POTEMKIN-like diet of 'borscht' (aka, maggot stew). Mr. Eisenstein lays the groundwork for American choreographer Busby Berkeley's cinematic masterpiece--'The Forgotten Man' marching number--with his scenes of Odessa on Parade. And POTEMKIN's famed Baby Buggy Massacre foreshadows the upcoming wanton slaughter of World War One's Defrauded PENSION (NOT 'Bonus') Army Heroes--along with their wives and kiddies--near the Capitol Steps in Washington, DC, at the rifles of Herb Hoover, 'Black Jack' Pershing, Ike Eisenhower, Dougie MacArthur, and George S. Patton, who slew the 'this' out of We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Progressive Union Label Americans 'like 'carp' through a goose.'",9,0,2,19 November 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The lesson being taught here seems to be . . .
",". . . 'don't trust the chain of command.' In CAPTAIN AMER1CA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, there are two types of military personnel depicted: those who follow orders from their commanding officers, even when it means carrying out a 'Pre-Emptive strike' on 20 million civilians, including the valedictorian of an Iowa City High School (who will presumably become the grandmother of a freedom fighter in the distant future, along the lines of the TERMINATOR franchise), and those who think for themselves, such as Chris Evans, Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, and Scarlett Johansson. Since this movie was not made in a vacuum, it obviously is 'preaching' to the U.S. military, which owns more than half the world's martial resources. The writers no doubt are aware that a former C.I.A. chief\defense secretary who died last week--James Schlesinger--had to 'go outside' the chain of command so that President Richard Nixon could not nuke either Vietnam or Cleveland (or perhaps both) as he fought to save his presidency. A military coup was Nixon's 'Plan B,' but Schlesinger defied the chain of command to stop both. On the other hand, polls show many if not most Americans believe the White House plant in 2001 ordered the USAF to 'stand down' during the terrorism attack on America, to further the interests of the oil men who put him in the Oval Office even though he lost the election. Therefore, if you have a child in the U.S. military, advise him or her AGAINST seeing CAPTAIN AMER1CA, unless you want them to prevent the next 9-11 by going against the chain of command, as Schlesinger, Evans, Mackie, Jackson, and Johansson all have done.",7,0,2,7 April 2014
Doctor Strange," The 3% of DOCTOR STRANGE viewers who stay for the final scene . . .
",". . . (which comes AFTER 'all' the closing credits) will learn that it's now Open Season on Harry Potter & Friends. When Mordo attacks Pangborn, he mutters 'The world has too many wizards.' This is a dead giveaway that Disney MegaBlobCorp intends on forcing AT&T to spin off Master Potter's Warner Bros. Studio to the House of Louse as the price of regulatory approval for AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. That way, the D-Blob will swallow up Warner's Potter Properties, just as they devoured Pixar, the Muppets, ESPN, ABC, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars. Anytime now we can expect a flick to hit the Big Screens in which Mordo sets his sights on Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Disney Multiverse. Kiefer Sutherland as the DESIGNATED SURVIVOR will be divvying up Kermit, LeBron, Woody, Luke, Miss Piggy, Thor, Nemo, Draco, Anakin, Bryce, Elmo, Ironman, Dory, Quasimodo, Jarjar, Wolverine, Ernie, and all the Princesses from Leia to Elsa into Team Mordo and Team Potter. Perhaps the Disney Blob will release what amounts to a gooey glob, but it cannot be much cheesier than the psychedelic Outer Space DOCTOR STRANGE spin on GROUNDHOG DAY. (Would you like some spaghetti with your multicolored meatballs, Doc?) By ripping bits and pieces from both good movies (INCEPTION) and bombs (THE LAST AIRBENDER), at least DOCTOR STRANGE is an Equal Opportunity target for copyright infringement lawsuits.",7,3,6,9 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Before rewatching this Epic Series from beginning to end . . .
",". . . I was fairly dismissive of all that jazz about the SITH being indistinguishable from the terrestrial Pachyderm Party. After all, I thought, Jerry 'Stumble-foot' Ford reincarnated as 'Jar-Jar BINKS'?! 'Come on, get real' an inner voice objected. However, as several new books out in the past two months document, STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER continues this saga's uncanny knack of dove-tailing closely with Real Life, from 1900s SITH ringleaders Noxious Nixon and Ford to more recent criminals, including The Gypper, The Weasel and The Orange Buffoon (obviously a dead ringer for Emperor PALPATINE). Just as Real Life unmasked the fact that Jar-Jar was a SITH mole, The Art of STAR WARS discloses that our POTUS #45 is a satanic SITH (aka, Red Commie Russian Kremlin KGB) asset, planted inside America's once-hallowed Oval Office to dance around like a marionette on strings--a pawn with no volition of its own, compelled to surrender wars, treasonously give up military secrets, betray and back-stab loyal allies, torment Ukraine and degrade the USA into a hellacious lawless knock-off of Mother Russia. STAR WARS IX's #1 takeaway? The Force WAS with us, but now its 'Long Live the SITH!'",9,8,39,30 January 2020
The Lost City of Z," Considered the Primary Source Material for about half of Literature's Jungle Books . . .
",". . . Percy Fawcett was friends with the authors of SHERLOCK HOLMES and SHE. He's also the inspiration for the Monty Python skit in which one of the crew takes a Backbush Constitutional and another soon stumbles into the steaming pile, removes his boot, sniffs its sole, and remarks, 'Dr. Livingston, I presume.' That's because Percy entered the Amazonia Rain Forest on his Lucky Seventh Expedition intending to install his eldest son Jack as God for the local tribes, only to Beta Test the Art of the Deal: Percy himself wriggled out of a sticky wicket by divvying up Jack's remains among the tribe in question, cementing his own future as a Cannibal King and giving rise to the English fatalism, 'Sometimes you eat the Gods, and sometimes the Gods eat you.' Essentially, THE LOST CITY OF Z covers about 8% of the tamer events in Percy Fawcett's known life. In addition to discovering perhaps half of South America's various unique species, Percy may well have stumbled across one or more Fountains of Youth, in which case he's still alive and chowing down on 'the other White meat' even Today!",8,0,6,8 May 2017
Southpaw," Some viewers may see SOUTHPAW as just another fight flick but . . .
",". . . it's more than a ROCKY remake. Jake Gyllenhaal's pugilist character, Billy Hope, begins the story as a Super-Rich World Champ. As implausible as this may seem give Billy's pale demographic, this is the key to the allegorical structure of SOUTHPAW. Billy is meant by the filmmakers to represent America's Golden One Per Centers, who are overwhelmingly White despite a handful of Oprahs, Tigers, and LeBrons. Billy's daughter, Leila, stands in for the rest of us--the 99% of Ordinary People Americans. Billy Hope losing his first fight, his wife, his career, his support team, his home, and custody of his daughter echoes the U.S. financial crash of 2008. In order to win his daughter back (along with a few incidentals), Yesterday's One Per Center Fat Cat Billy must spend a big chunk of his life cleaning the toilets of us normal people, which is exactly what SOUTHPAW's producers (The Weinstein Company) want Donald Trump to do BEFORE he asks for our votes. Let's see if The Donald can follow in Billy's footsteps, scrubbing out the Thrones dearest to the Hearts of America during 16-hour days for the next 15 months! Billy comes out of this tale with custody of his kid, and a room at the Y (or some such place). That's how the Trump-type folks can best weather the Coming Storm, SOUTHPAW suggests.",8,1,3,7 August 2015

",". . . in which Marvel and Disney want us to believe that a human being can shrink to infinitely small proportions and not only still be fully functioning, but also have the capacity to return to 'normal' size no worse for wear. Paul Rudd, as ANT-MAN II, is shown floating in a daze amid a sea of SUB-atomic particles, in a tableau smacking of TRON, FANTASTIC VOYAGE, and THE MATRIX. Not only that, but such a person can communicate telepathically with insects when he's their intermediate size. This gets one to thinking, 'How does ANT-MAN downsize the bubble captions that his thoughts normally occupy, as the regular size surely would explode an ant's brain?' You may argue that Rudd's thought bubbles would naturally be expected to have microscopic sizing when HE does, but that still leaves the problem of retired ANT-MAN I (Michael Douglas), who habitually sends his full-sized musings about 'One lump or two?' into his enslaved ants teeny-tiny brain pans. I think the ants behind this flick need to give these points more thought before churning out possible sequels.",8,0,4,26 July 2015

NIGHTCRAWLER is the most complete expose of America's corporate culture ever put on screen. It's not as Cartoonish as AMER!CAN PSYCHO, not as claustrophobic as GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, and not as number-numbing as ARBITRAGE or WALL STREET. Not only that, but NIGHTCRAWLER outdoes NETWORK in PROVING that the journalistic ideal of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a giant load of bull, and that today's news media slime around rubbing shoulders with the others in the lowest circle of the Corporate Hell-to-Come, Big Oil and Big Medicine. As a survivor of several U.S. media conglomerates, about the only thing for which I'm thankful is that I was never 'down-sized' as ruthlessly as 'Rick' in NIGHTCRAWLER. It's nice that writer\director Dan Gilroy-was-here to expose all the maggots writhing just below the skin of American culture.",10,2,4,22 November 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," POPSTAR blows the whistle on the 'pop music' industry . . .
",". . . disclosing that 'popular' tunes are simply a random collection of notes and syllables packaged to please the diminished perception of drunken or otherwise impaired youngsters who should be out fighting terrorism, easing poverty, and tackling rapists. The 117 leading 'song artists' making cameo appearances here obviously are taking great pride in delivering their spoof lines of Palavered Drivel with straight faces. The funnier thing is that you could read the same sort of Pompous Pontification in any issue of Rolling Stone and its competing Zines including self-styled 'music reviews,' and the pretensions on display would be even greater assaults against Common Sense and Rational Thinking. Since the advent of Autotune, your Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel could be the equal of any 'Pop Star' selling out stadiums, as long as they are limber enough to simulate obscene body positions (something within the capabilities of any individuals still able to use the toilet by themselves). The definition of 'Pop Music' always has been anything that will make someone older than yourself (or the reviewer) cringe. 'Pop Music' is NOT fully accessible to pop drinkers, or to people exercising their better judgment. As Brian Wilson had it, BURP SOUNDS better expresses the Essence of Pop. POPSTAR serves as a reminder NOT to take any music written since Bach seriously.",8,17,32,12 June 2016

The first thing that Freddy does in Rock Band Land is to declare himself Queen of the foursome, and rename the whole shebang after himself. Freddy is much more of a Red Queen than a White Monarch (though he takes after that social butterfly Alice in that he plunges down every rabbit hole he runs across). Eventually Freddy tries to race Across the Universe in true Mercury fashion, belting out six minutes of a BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. But then he catches AIDS from some farmers, and decides to rest on his laurels by declaring himself to be 'Champion of the World.' Since this never ending story clocks in at well over two hours, there's plenty of time to cram in the thousands of little snits and petty quarrels among Freddy's many families: The Zoroastrians, the former dental hygienists, the leather shop crowd, the breeders, and the gold record farmers (who perhaps should be designated as 'miners'). At any rate, BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY is the kind of fairy tale that includes kisses for everyone (even the frogs).",9,0,11,6 November 2018
Justice League," Warner Bros. keeps the JUSTICE LEAGUE firmly grounded in Reality . . .
",". . . by having a Junior Leaguer ask Bruce Wayne, 'What's YOUR Super Power?' to which Wayne replies 'Money!' Warner reinforces this warning to the World during the final, post-credits scene, in which a more plausible and life-like Billionaire--Lex Luthor--threatens to create 'a league of our own.' Warner Bros. realizes that anyone with a brain in their head will quickly dismiss Superman, Wonder Woman, and their Junior Leaguer Wannabes as Pure Fantasy, or so much Wishful Thinking. The red-haired Steppenwolf, on the other hand, is a Dead Ringer for American Strongman and Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin. To sum up, Warner warns us that We have met the Enemy, and it's Putin's Pedophiliac Repug Party (aka, The GOOPERS). These Billionaires brazenly instituted a Real Life 'League of Their Own' to run EVERY ASPECT of American Life for we True Blue Loyal Patriot Honest Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Citizens.

The Caine Mutiny," If we feel sorry for Queeg, do we have to pity Nixon, too?
","From the moment Captain Philip Francis Queeg gives the original version of Richard Milhous Nixon's infamous 'Checkers Speech' (as in, 'I'm really not that bad of a guy--even my little dog likes me'), it's clear that the fictional paranoid Naval Captain Queeg is the template for the all-too-real paranoid President Nixon. (President Reagan famously kept jars of jelly beans in the Oval Office; after watching THE CAINE MUTINY you'll swear that 'Tricky Dick' must have had bowls of ball bearings there to finger whenever he felt a 'Saturday Night Massacre' coming on). Queeg's irrational behavior threatens to scuttle a fictional Navy 'rust bucket.' Nixon's psychotic 'Reign of Terror' nearly destroyed America a decade after this movie came out. As THE CAINE MUTINY illustrates, historically male hierarchy systems are prone to the sort of blind 'Groupthink' which can march a ship's crew off the figurative gang plank, or an entire nation off the cliff into history's dust bin (where is the Third Reich today?). Words such as 'military discipline' and 'chain of command' often are code for De Facto suicide pacts. Unfortunately, such infectious thinking has seeped into our civilian sector today (who's the Queeg\Nixon in YOUR work place?). THE CAINE MUTINY would have been immortalized as the 'Best Picture' of 1954, except for a 'Yellowstain' performance, involving a craven recantation, in real life blotting the reputation of the man Oscar-nominated for playing Queeg, Humphrey Bogart. Ironically, 'Bogie' aped 'Caine' crew member 'Tom Keefer's' cowardly retreat from Admiral Halsey and subsequent lying during 'Steve Maryk's' court martial by wimping out in front of the Blacklist Witch Trials in Washington, DC, when he could have asked Joe McCarthy, 'Have you no decency; no sense of shame; not an ounce of respect for America?' Bogart had only himself to blame for the rest of Academy voters following his example by caving in to runaway fascism, and presenting an undeserved 'politically correct' Best Picture award in 1954 instead to a far inferior film Helmed by a back-stabbing snitch: ON THE WATERFRONT.",10,0,2,19 March 2014
The Revenant," This isn't your grandpa's JEREMIAH JOHNSON . . .
",". . . as Robert Redford never had to crawl a thousand miles with a broken leg as the title character of that Western that set the standard for gutty realism and wintertime survival in the 1900s. Apparently, Oscar-nominated REVENANT director A.G. Inarritu has decided that his best chance for back-to-back wins (after last year's over-rated BIRDMAN, which stole the golden statuette from WHIPLASH) is to take a page out of Alfonso Cuaron's Oscar-winning Playbook for GRAVITY, as he recycles pretty much the same plot in an attempt to give Hispanic 'Magic Realism' (known as 'Fantasy' to those who speak American) a clean sweep of top awards during the past three popularity contests. Sure, GRAVITY takes place this century in Outer Space and THE REVENANT is set in the 1800s down here on Earth. But these are just superficial differences, when you consider the core of each plot. Both Sandra Bullock and Leo DiCaprio keep seeing Dead People, a hallmark of Magic Realism. They both face a personal survival challenge, though not much is on the line for either one of them beyond their own life. Bullock and DiCaprio's characters both get help from unexpected foreign sources, as implausible serendipity substitutes for adult logic in Magic Realism. But Hispanic Fantasy is trendy with the Hollywood 'Elites' currently, and anything that smacks of Real Life and has something important to say about today's world (think THE HATEFUL EIGHT and TRUMBO) gets the Stink Eye from Tinseltown.",9,0,2,16 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Steven Spielberg documents that few if any U.S. officials . . .
",". . . actually believe that they should uphold the American Constitution in practice (if even in theory). Spielberg proves many if not most American law enforcement and military officers, prosecutors, judges, and lawmakers perjure themselves when they take their oaths of office to live at U.S. taxpayer expense. Crooked FBI and CIA agents, prosecutors, judges, and cops abound in Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES. All of them apparently had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they were sworn into their offices, thinking that they will 'uphold the Constitiution' only when it's convenient and profitable to themselves to do so, treating it like toilet paper whenever it conflicts with their personal agendas, profit motives, idiosyncratic belief structures, or if they feel a sudden urge to enjoy an 'opposite day' at the Constitution's expense (not unlike most of the officials depicted in the current release, BLACK MASS). I say, cut the hypocrisy now! Things have gotten much worse in America since 1957, when the BRIDGE OF SPIES story begins. Let President Obama make it official, and tear up that ratty old parchment signed by James Madison & Co. on a live national TV broadcast. Follow up this PURGE-with-a-purpose by letting the Walton Family, whose Wal-Mart Co. just had a really bad week, dash off a New Constitution everyone can believe in, as a gesture which says, 'Thanks for all the fish!'",10,3,8,19 October 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Since they conclude with Quantum Explosions . . .
",". . . and especially because they each opened in American theaters on December 14, 2018, viewers have naturally wondered whether MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE tell the same story. The quick answer to this question is a simple 'Yes.' Let's examine some of the areas of congruence . The makers of MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-VERSE strive mightily to make their characters more 'diverse' than a United Nations picnic. This is quite ironic, because these flicks emanate from New Zealand and Japan, two of the LEAST diverse, most homogenous places on Earth, with immigration policies that make the USA's current White House Occupant seem like a spiritual brother to the Statue of Liberty by way of comparison. However, SPIDER-VERSE deserves a higher satisfaction rating than MORTAL ENGINES because it celebrates a hallowed past (even after ALL of its end credits have rolled), while the latter flick runs out of gas desperately seeking to set up sequels which will rival HEAVEN'S GATE II, HOWARD THE DUCK QUACKS AGAIN, and ANOTHER ISHTAR when it comes to audience demand.",9,9,16,21 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mark Twain once said that, 'A NIGHT AT THE OPERA . . . '
","' . . . is a good walk spoiled.' In this loose remake of director Alfred Hitchcock's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH II (1956), the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (episode 24 or so) people quadruple the number gun-wielding assassins Hitchcock had prowling around in an opera hall, and switch the program to Puccini's TURANDOT (which was just used for similar dramatic purposes by another action blockbuster a few months back, but I'm not any better than Twain in keeping my opera cameos straight). Tom Cruise also retraces Jimmy Stewart's footsteps to Morocco from TOO MUCH (though since kidnapped children would raise the suspense stakes far too high for today's squeamish movie audiences, only Cruise's comic relief sidekick gets snatched here). Anyone expecting a big musical hit to emerge from MISSION 24, such as Doris Day singing her young son to Freedom with 'Que, Sera, Sera,' will be sorely disappointed. So too will the folks dying to know what happens in TURANDOT. (SPOILER ALERT: Ping, Pong, and Pang cannot persuade the Mystery Prince to tell Turandot his name, but after Liu's tortured and kills herself, Turandot decides to live happily-ever-after with the Prince, anyway). But for fans of implausible chases, bad guys who cannot shoot the broad side of a palace, and imaginary Higher Tech, MISSION 24 won't disappoint.",8,0,2,14 February 2016

It's hard to imagine that ANY viewer will side with the Stark Toadie Faction (and if there are any of that ilk, there ought to be some way to compile a list of them for future watch lists and possible sanctions). America's Fatal Flaw is that a majority of its people Worship Money, and view those that hoard the most of it as Gods on Earth.

Jackie," Many, if not most, Americans have learned from the late-night . . .
",". . . radio program COAST-TO-COAST and many other sources that Lyndon Johnson (aka, LBJ), Richard 'Tricky Dick' Nixon, and the George Bushes (that is, H.W. and just plain W., plus a few others, probably including Ted Cruz's dad) met in a Texas hotel room the night of Nov. 21, 1963, to fine-tune President Jack 'JFK' Kennedy's Assassination the next day in Dallas, and divvy up the pecking order for who'd be President when. JACKIE Kennedy smelled a rat as soon as the first bullet flew, demanding within a few hours to personally interrogate self-proclaimed 'patsy' (or fall guy; aka, The Thane of Cawdor) Lee Oswald, which is why the High Treason plotters had to whack him immediately, too, JACKIE documents. This, of course, is the stuff of Bill Shakespeare, who no doubt would vote JACKIE the 'Best Movie' Oscar this year if his SAG Card were up-to-date. JACKIE includes spot-on portrayals of all the leading villains who destroyed America's Golden Age of Camelot, including Lady Macbeth (aka, Ladybird Johnson; 'Macbeth' obviously meaning 'Big Bird' in Scottish). If Shakespeare were making movies for the past 60 years, surely CAMELOT would be one of his comedies and he'd be proud to claim JACKIE as a Shakespearian Tragedy fit to go into rotation at Stratford Festivals with HAMLET and MACBETH.",10,1,6,10 January 2017
Inside Out," INSIDE OUT teaches impressionable Little Ones . . .
",". . . that their heads are full of bickering adults, who may cause them to catastrophically run amok without warning. If they suddenly wreak mayhem totally out of character, it's not their fault at all, INSIDE OUT suggests. Blame it, rather, on the tiny voices quarreling constantly from one end of their brains to the other. Advice, rules, cautions, responsibilities, social norms, parental expectations, American Values, homework, politeness, best behaviors, decency, kindness, daily chores, proper decorum, and common sense can all be thrown to the winds whirling inside each child's noggin. Their very self-hood is shown to be based upon a relatively small handful of memories subject to gross distortion at the drop of a hat. INSIDE OUT personifies the Aging Process as a callously cackling cleaning crew clearing cherished memories off the Cliff of Self Awareness into the Chasm of Forgetfulness. Disney pictures a Child's Mind as a miniature Disneyland, complete with 'Imagination Island,' 'Goofball Island,' and so on. The Mouse House's clear implication is that if you don't refresh your kids' minds at Disneyland regularly, they're liable to take a bus to Duluth--or worse! INSIDE OUT may be too frightening for children, but it certainly provides a young mass shooter's defense lawyer with a dream team.",8,2,21,24 June 2015
Yesterday," Perhaps the most important word in YESTERDAY's script is . . .
",". . . 'Shakespeare.' Though this flick explicitly asks, 'What if the Beatles, Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and Harry Potter NEVER happened?' its implicit primary query must be stated as 'What if the Bard was never born?' Think about it. If the Stalwart on Avon never existed (and was unknown to EVERYBODY except YOU!), then if you said 'The Truth must out,' or pledged 'My kingdom for a horse!' other people would raise their eyebrows. If you advised your college-bound kids, 'To thine own selves be True' they might laugh in your face. When you were giving your bottle of Spray and Wash a workout at your local laundromat and muttered 'Out, out, Dark Spot!' nobody would credit you with a smidgen of erudition. If you told someone 'All the World's a stage,' they might retort 'So break a leg!' If you persisted in prepping for an audition while walking through a cornfield, declaiming 'Friends, chums, country bums: Lend me your ears!' Vincent might give you BOTH of his! Upon noting, 'Money is the root of all Evil,' any Pachyderm within earshot might stick out their hands. Or if these miscreants heard you lament, 'What a spider's web we weave, when first we practice to deceive,' Designated Liar 'Sirrah Huckleberry' could retort 'Practice makes perfect.'

Avengers: Endgame," In the past two weeks both of America's actual cable news networks . . .

Where these courageous news outlets may differ amongst themselves is in regard to which facets of the Armageddon-like Final Battle of the movie represent who, among the Axis of Evil's Real Life gathering of Satanic Forces. While 'R. Maddow' on MSNBC has not been shy about pointing out that the cinema Bad Guy's Giant Flying Slug is a dead ringer for POTUS #45, CNN's 'A. Cooper' seems equally convinced that this flick's 'Thanos' is met to represent 'The Teflon Don.' Today, in THIS Reality, as 'Little Rocket Man' is initiating the World's Nuclear Meltdown, as Iran verges on erasing Israel, as the USA's cold Trade War with Red Commie China is a nuclear football away from turning Red Hot, and as 'Mad Vlad' Putin's henchman (aka, the White House Pawn, aka the KGB Puppet) declares himself 'President for Life,' does it really matter whether Rachel or Anderson is the most correct?",9,2,15,9 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Cry me a river, and while you're at it . . .
",". . . move it underground without anyone noticing, so I can sell it back to the weepers. QUANTUM OF SOLACE is oddly Q-less, with the 'Bond. James Bond.' line long gone, and the iconic gun barrel Bond view tacked on as a closing credits afterthought. Perversely, Agent 007's martini recipe has been over-complicated here. Sure, there's a car chase, a foot chase, a boat chase, a plane chase, and something big implausibly exploding at the end, but it's mostly a case of 'been there, done that.' Worse yet, many scenes are shamelessly cannibalized from earlier Bonds, none more jarring than Bond playmate 'Strawberry Fields'' oily spoof of Shirley Eaton ('Jill Masterson')'s spray-painted demise in GOLDFINGER. One of the few mercies is that the loosely described 'Quantum' criminal syndicate is NOT made into an awkward acronym here along the lines of S.M.E.R.S.H. or S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (HOW could the scriptwriters pass on the obvious 'Quiet Usurpers of Aquatic National Treasure Using Murder'?) About the only original passage in the story's uncharacteristically brief 106-minute running time is the shootout during a violent scene from the opera TOSCA. The proverbial 'Fat Lady' may not be singing to denote the end of the Bond series yet, but you can hear her loudly clearing her throat.",6,0,2,8 November 2014
Gone with the Wind," The reasons WHY this flick is worse than and MUST be outlawed like Kiddie Porn . . .
",". . . are Self-Evident to ALL Loyal Patriotic Normal Average True Blue Progressive Union Label Americans. From its mendacious opening scroll to Rhett Butler's final words about Damnation, GONE WITH THE WIND (as well as Margaret Mitchell's poorly-written source material) perpetuates and celebrates the most Evil BIG LIE in all of American History. If Leni Riefenstahl were alive today to make a sequel to her star-making vehicle for Adolph Hitler (TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, an equally over-rated Propaganda Piece that came out within a few months of GWTW's Grand Premiere), and IF Der Fuhrer were alive and kicking (and able to rant in semi-coherent English), Hitler could easily co-opt the supporters of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin's White House Sock Puppet Don Juan Rump in a New York Minute. Such is the power of Big Money Cinema, even when this sinful enema is flushing out the most vile excrement imaginable, such as TRIUMPH OF THE WILL or GONE WITH THE WIND. It is ILLEGAL even Today for Germans to own a copy of Ms. Riefenstahl's Satanic TRIUMPH, and the U.S. Government MUST take similar action against GWTW immediately! How many Heather Heyers must die before this KKK recruiting tool is eradicated?!When Kiddie Porn was outlawed, there was no 'Grandfather Clause' to allow perverts to retain the smut that they had legally purchased in the 1950s for 'Old Time's Sake' or 'to Preserve Film History.' (You can still Google stories about Oklahoma State Troopers seizing Blockbuster VHS tape rental records so that they could kick in the doors of folks who'd just rented the PG-13 movie version of Gunther Grass's coming-of-age novel, THE TIN DRUM.) Also, ISIS beheading Youtubes now can be found only on the Dark Web--NOT in public Art House Film Festival Revivals or in University Film Appreciation Classes aimed at Impressionable Youth. America MUST follow Germany's lead Vis a Vis Nazi paraphernalia in regard to GWTW. ALL copies of this Demonic Fake Facts Racist Screed MUST be incinerated ASAP, along with ALL the Rhett and Scarlett dolls, GWTW posters and lobby cards, Grand Premiere newsreel footage, and so forth. This should be VERY easy to do--all the GWTW offal added together amounts to less than 1% of the Kiddie Porn already stamped out by our Brave FBI Agents. For each person killed by Evil Kiddie Porn, more than 100 have died at the hands of GWTW's Racist White Supremacy 'Romance.' EVERY Black person who's lived from the 1930s up until Today has suffered at least some harm from GWTW, even if they have not paid the Ultimate Price by being Lynched or run over by a Dodge Charger. If YOU have seen GWTW more than once, go get your head examined to see if you're a ticking time bomb like Dylann Roof, or if your name merely belongs on the coming-soon National Registry of Racists!",4,2,23,9 September 2017
Toy Story 4," 'What if 'Woody' lost his 'Peep,' and did not know . . . '

Bo not only knows baseball and football, but she also runs a mean zip line. After suffering the ordeal of a forcible amputation (at the hands of a doll NOT named 'Lorena!'), can a maimed Woody fare better than 'Jake' did as twilight falls in THE SUN ALSO RISES? Or will TOY STORY 5 take a tragic turn, with a homeless Woody swearing off Bo, as unable to perform when it counts as 'Papa Hemingway's' frustrated Mr. Barnes? Pixar's animated features are notorious for their dark undercurrents, and TOY STORY 4 is no deviation from this pattern. What the scissors of 'Gabby's' henchmen taketh, Ms. Peep's crook will prove powerless to return. In a Perfect World, Bo and Woody might live happily ever after, raising a flock of little peeps to follow in their father's footsteps.

The Fault in Our Stars," If you lop off one letter from the back of the adjective 'cute' . . .

THE FAULT IN OUR STARS teaches us that, 'There's no 'I' in cancer,' at least when it strikes youths of a certain age. These sufferers spend most of their time kissing each other because, unlike adult victims of the disease, they never have 'cancer breath.' The constant sniffling from the young audience surrounding me prove that it is very sad when young Americans glowing with the pink of health actually are dying of cancer, even though they get to go to Disney World AND Amsterdam. Of course, for every ONE fatally stricken U.S. cancer youth there must be a hundred or a thousand more youthful Africans and Asian lives snuffed out (by Ebola, AIDS, war, and starvation) with a degree of 'oblivion' unimaginable to FAULT lovers Gus and Hazel.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," Unsavory goulash or exquisite clutter?
","You know your movie is getting overcrowded when it becomes nearly impossible to tell who belongs on the poster and who is to be relegated to an Unbilled Cameo. Milton Welsh (AEON FLUX, CONAN THE BARBARIAN) is on-screen for more scenes lasting longer than is Tom Wilkerson. However, most everybody else at my screening were gray-haired old farts approximately Wilkerson's age, as opposed to the Milton Welsh crowd, who are still in their reproductive years. Therefore, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL plasters Wilkerson on its poster to appeal to its target audience (folks with one foot in the grave), most of whom could not distinguish Welsh from their own great-grandchildren. THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is ALL about the past, with lines such as, 'His world vanished long before he ever entered it.' As Michael Bay once said, 'Those who can, transform the 'Now' into Tomorrow. Those who cannot, make 'Art' films.' The best thing about THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is that it provides so many jobs for codgers. With every flick like this, it's likely to be one less plug for the Old Broke Actors' Poor House we'll be forced to sit through at the multiplex (and less social security gravy train dough stolen from today's teens).",8,0,6,2 April 2014
The Favourite," As the World chortles hysterically at the 'Brexit' debacle . . .

For centuries, this beleaguered island has limped along as the decadent play land of the Super Rich. THE FAVOURITE faithfully depicts these demonic clowns as blithering bozos, interested in nothing beyond bankrupting the Working Class to finance their Wild Orgies of Perversion and underwrite as many senseless slaughterhouse wars around the globe as possible. Though THE FAVOURITE only covers about a decade at the beginning of the 1700s, it soon becomes clear that any nation which allows itself to stagger along under the curse of a 'Royal Family' richly deserves all the Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti Providence surely will throw its way. EVERY 'Royal Family' of which there's a historical record notoriously has been culled from the most sordid Dregs of Humanity, soon being further riddled with all the maladies and deviances known to Man due to rampant in-breeding. THE FAVOURITE's 'Queen Anne' embodies most if not all of these gross short-comings. With Anne accurately documented here as a sorry excuse for a person, it's obvious that England could have fared better with a frog on its throne!",9,5,12,17 January 2019
Foxcatcher," As Lord Acton once said, 'Wrestling corrupts, and Freestyle wrestling . . . '
","' . . . corrupts Freesylishly.' FOXCATCHER documents how wrestling ruined the lives of several people, renown Orinthologist, Conchologist, Philatelist, Museum Director, and Multimillionaire John Eleutere Du Pont foremost among them. Prior to being bit by the wrestling bug, Doctor (of Natural Sciences) Du Pont discovered 24 species of birds, authored several books about our feathered friends, and for fun purchased the world's most valuable stamp (the 1856 one-of-a-kind British Guiana, notably held by Audrey Hepburn in the film CHARADE). But concurrent with his descent into the underworld of big-time world wrestling, all of Du Pont's old friends and acquaintances noticed be was getting more and more erratic (if not paranoid). This movie is from the point of view of the surviving Olympic Gold Medalist wrestling brother, implying that John introduced HIM to alcohol and cocaine. (Anyone who's been around wrestlers will bet that it was ACTUALLY the other way around, but John's not alive to defend himself!) Wrestling compels this young man to trash hotel rooms, avoid women, as well as to engage in binge eating and regurgitation. Schools value his hang-dog presence as a motivational speaker at $20 a pop (about $9,980 less than Lance Armstrong or O.J. Simpson). In their wisdom, the International Olympic Committee banned wrestling from future Olympics after John's martyrdom, recognizing it for the perverse splinter religion it is. Yet it's allowed to continue corrupting and even killing American high schoolers today (one was found dead in his bed by his mom not far from me this morning). Worse yet, John never recovered from his wrestling disease, and was buried in his FOXCATCHER red singlet, in accordance with his will.",8,3,9,7 January 2015
It Follows," IT FOLLOWS does a fair job of revealing the horrors of Michigan . . .
",". . . where it was filmed; horrors of which I experienced many first-hand during my recent visit with relatives there, which included them 'treating' me to a showing of this flick in the Detroit Zoo suburb of Royal Oak. Several montage scenes of this movie's characters driving around at random indicates that you could transplant the Bates Motel, HELL HOUSE, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, and every other Hollywood horror flick setting into the Wolverine State, and the residents there would see it as an upgrade. The high school kids pictured in IT FOLLOWS are so backwards they still have to use land lines! They spend about half their time at beaches, but they never seem to swim, since it's almost always too cold to go in. Because long-time Michigan resident Thomas Edison invented horror movies with his film ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT (for real), and his victim Topsy has a long memory, it makes Karmic sense that Michigan would be Ground Zero for a new STD that transmits ghost zombies to the teens who sleep with everyone in sight, such as the kids in IT FOLLOWS. But this flick pales in comparison to the REAL LIFE horrors of Michigan, such as the story in the news during my visit of the single lady who moved to the Detroit area from the East Coast, died of unknown causes in her Jeep in her garage, and got mummified before she was discovered by the 'authorities' FIVE YEARS LATER!",7,63,130,25 March 2015
Legend," Fox News and CNN's Anderson Cooper won't repeat . . .

Instead, they run 'One Shining Moment'-type music (like at the end of the March Madness Title Game) over a victims' photo collage as soon as they can get their paws on some pictures. But this artificial Grief Porn doesn't change the fact that there's never been so much as a made-for-TV or even a direct-to-video feature film made about any previously anonymous victim of either a mass killing or a serial slayer. 'The Krays,' on the other hand, have had at least TWO feature films playing on the Big Screen (including current release LEGEND) to carefully detail their sordid gangster careers and all the people they killed. The nationwide Family Video chain in America has carried multiple flicks about John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Ted Bundy because that's just what U.S. citizens crave in the way of family entertainment. Anderson Cooper and Fox News do Americans a great disservice in making us wait five or ten years for the mass and serial killer details we have a right to learn for our own protection.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," As a bevy of snickering young ladies streamed out of . . .
",". . . my showing of ONCE UPON A TIME IN H0LLYWOOD--beaming with ear-to-ear grins--it was difficult to believe that H0LLYWOOD writer\director 'Q.T.' had ever been accused of 'misogyny.' While the main female character here is portrayed as a dirty-soled adulteress with a thing for 12-year-old boys, at least she doesn't eat any of the canned dog food. The latter distinction belongs (more or less) to the second-fiddle H0LLYWOOD female, who has her entire face mashed in by a full can of canine chow being fired into it like a fastball. (After just ten minutes of noisy suffering, this wailing banshee is mercifully dispatched with a flame thrower.) Though some might argue that the Alpo-visage chick's fate pales in comparison to that of her female companion (a demise involving being partially EATEN by a bulldog, THEN having her mug shattered and flattened against eight extremely hard and hateful objects), let's not forget about the harpy battle-axe 'Janet,' who only has the side of her car caved in when 'Rick' tosses 'Cato' halfway through it.",9,15,27,31 July 2019
Gone Girl," Salt of the Earth from America's Heartland . . .
",". . . GONE GIRL is every woman's fantasy, along the lines of 50 SHADES OF GREY, which previewed before my GG showing. If you think the Femme Fatales in those Chinese martial arts flicks or the SIN CITY series are realistic, then you will have no problem with GONE GIRL. On the other hand, guys will find 'Amazing Amy's' Hijinks hoot-out-loud entertaining. (A little hint for any cerebral viewers: novelist\screenwriter Gillian Flynn couldn't possibly mean anyone to see any aspect of verisimilitude between Real Life and any events or characters in this tall tale, so she obviously means it to be taken allegorically, with 'Amazing Amy' being George W. Bush and Suffering Nick a stand-in for Barack Obama.) Since IMDb says this comment is too short so far to be acceptable, I'll simply add a thank you to My Own Personal Gone Girl, who picked me up a while back as I was desperately hitch-hiking during an ice storm from Marquette, MI to Cape Giradeau, MO--where much of GONE GIRL was shot, jogging my memory. A few hours earlier I believe Jeffrey Dahmer had given me a ride but left me off with a warning not to trust people who picked up strangers (I guess I was less his 'type' than Gone Girl's).",9,0,13,6 October 2014
Aladdin," 'Steal an apple and you're a thief . . . '

Jafar, of course, is an aptly drawn proxy for the Mouse House's full-on frontal assault against alleged POTUS #45 a year prior to the 2020 American Presidential tussle. Jafar echoes the rump cushion administration in continually saying 'Women should be seen, NOT heard!' Not unlike the USA's Game-Show-Host-in-Chief, Jafar prevents the People's Choice from becoming her country's first female ruler. Using hypnotism, sorcery, and bogus nationalistic threats to rile up and control his deplorable base of core supporters, Jafar is solely obsessed with the accumulation of dictatorial powers and ill-gotten wealth. Short of reading the Emoluments Clause from the U.S. Constitution, ALADDIN could not be more specific in vilifying the rump cushion mob. Doubtless scores of movies will try to nail the swindler currently bankrupting Casino America during the next few months. It's hard to imagine that many of these will top ALADDIN when it comes to exposing the current White House Crime Syndicate.",10,4,10,17 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," Did Edgar Allan Poe dream up . . .
",". . . Stephen Hawking? String theory and quantum physics suggest this is possible. A look at the evidence in the current film release--THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING-- indicates this is likely the case. Since my next door neighbor was diagnosed with and relatively quickly died from Lou Gehrig's disease, Hawking's survival for 51 years and counting never ceases to amaze me. (My neighbor, before passing, once said that Hawking is somewhat controversial in the ALS community; it sounded as if they suspect him of have Gehrig's disease 'Lite,' or something.) EVERYTHING is an amazing (if somewhat Soap Opera-Ish) movie in which actor Eddie Redmayne outdoes Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis' offering from MY LEFT FOOT. Is it just a coincidence that Poe wrote 'Eureka' (1846) in an apparent attempt to explain everything? (Being one of the six living humans who has actually READ Eureka, I need to point out in Poe's defense that Hawking had the shoulders of more giants such as Einstein on which to stand than did the 'Raven' author.) Furthermore, anyone who has read Poe's short story 'The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar' (1845) will see an almost perfect parallel to Hawking's personal situation as they watch EVERYTHING. In addition to anticipating Hawking's life's work and unique personal circumstances, Poe's recurring fear in nearly half his tales was of a living death (or of being entombed alive--most famously in 'The Fall of the House of Usher,' 1839). Is it too much to say that Stephen Hawking is Poe's worst nightmare come true?",10,1,4,24 November 2014
Room," ROOM is a disturbing look into the Canadian Psyche . . .
",". . . that is far easier to take allegorically than in any literal sense of story-telling. As a linear tale, ROOM is deeply flawed, building to its primary climax just 58 minutes into the 118-minute feature film, and then tacking on a pretty boring final hour (that mostly emptied my American theater by the end of the showing). However, when astute viewers realize that the main characters and locales in ROOM are standing in for other things, the flick as a whole is much easier to take. Perhaps if it was more directly titled (CANADIAN CONFESSIONS, for instance) more people in the world film market might 'get' it. This movie is suggesting that most if not all Canadians feel trapped in a cold, squalid room or shed--sort of a back bay to the Real World tantalizingly close (but a world away) just South of their border. The ironically named Mom here, 'Joy,' tries to convince son Jack that every wall has two sides, but Jack's not really buying it. Jack's kidnapper\rapist father, of course, is meant to represent Uncle Sam, that is, America. And Jack himself, certainly, stands in for the Canadian film industry, infamous for being comprised of a million counterfeit Americas--amazingly including ROOM itself (C'Mon, guys, don't tell us ROOM is in 'America,' and then show a politically-incorrect 'Apache Burger' joint just down the block in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada!). When Joy, with Jack's help, escapes ROOM (for the wider world of America, allegorically speaking), she has so much regret over what she's missed during the prime of her life the past seven years she attempts suicide. Only Jack (that is, the fraudulent Canadian film industry, the country's main export now that the XL Pipeline won't be spewing nation-killing tar sands oil to the rest of the planet) is able to cheer up Joy (at least, while in some sort of confined ROOM, such as a theater or shed).",8,3,18,12 November 2015
The Lion King," These 'Dippy Nature Films' are getting less and less plausible . . .
",". . . not unlike taking a 'safari ride' at Dippy World. At least the genuine, original LION KING flick admitted to being a cartoon fantasy. However, this alleged 'live action' remake is sillier than any symphony starring 'Lucky Louse.' To see herds of CGI African animals keeping 'straight faces' as their mouths spout out fluent American is very off-putting to True Nature Lovers, as well as to the students of the Afrocentric Academies now permeating all of the USA's major cities. (This film does not even have an AHAD animal welfare approval number in its closing credits, as 'no animals were used in the making of this movie.') Currently the usurpers in power in both America and Brazil are waging a cut-throat duel to determine which of them will go down as the biggest villain in the on-going World Extinction Event. The Dippy folks are acting as enablers for these malicious miscreants, giving young generations of movie goers an attitude of 'With CGI, who needs REAL animals?'",8,0,2,27 August 2019
A Quiet Place," This flick pictures an America with NO 'Freedom of Speech' . . .
",". . . as apparently government-engineered toothy cyborgs with giant ears roam the country, swift to shred anyone foolish enough to utter a single syllable. A QUIET PLACE begins about three months into this Gooper Reign of Terror, after around 99% of We Non-Bunkered Loyal Patriotic Normal Progressive Union Label citizens already have been slain. While the Fat Cat One Per Centers are hunkering down, swilling their champagne and caviar deep underground, A QUIET PLACE examines a year in the life of a heavily-armed looter family. These rural 'core supporters' (that is, duped pawns) of the Current Corrupt Regime divide their time between shoplifting, fishing, and making babies. Despite their best efforts, they wind up one kid and one parent short. (The climax of A QUIET PLACE implies that this clan will fill these gaps 'The Southern Way,' about which you may satisfy your curiosity by rereading the Old Testament account of Lot and His Daughters.) If you want to learn more about America's near future, when 'They' begin 'culling the herd' (after all, Rigged Elections have consequences, too), check out A QUIET PLACE.

The Longest Day," 'We are going to lose the war . . . '
","' . . . because our glorious Fuehrer has taken a sleeping pill and is not to be awakened,' laments a German field marshal around dawn on THE LONGEST DAY. With its peppy theme song desecrated by sappy, upbeat lyrics, this farce is no BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The soldiers there had the sense to merely whistle 'Colonel Bogie's March,' NOT prattle insipid lyrics glossing over unspeakable war-time agonies. Most of the spoken dialogue in THE LONGEST DAY sounds so contrived, pompous, and written 15 years after-the-fact that it seems probable that some of the dimmer bulbs in the cast--such as self-admitted potheads John Wayne and Robert Mitchum--were allowed to ad lib their own lines. With at least 60 speaking parts, most characters (including Henry Fonda's doomed American President's son) get lost in the shuffle, and virtually none merit a movie watcher's attention (no matter how Heroic their Real Life counterparts). If Hitler had had an opportunity to watch this three-hour snooze-fest, he would not have needed to take a sleeping pill in order to nod off! Producer Darryl F. Zanuck apparently was too dense to realize that having FIVE directors on your flick is nothing to crow about. If he wanted to be honest about something, he might have advertised that THE LONGEST DAY was mostly his effort to make his latest mistress--Irina Demich--a movie star, so that he could reap the perks that might come with her gratitude. THE LONGEST DAY is like giving SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a HOGAN'S HEROES makeover. This could well be one of the WORST World War Two pictures of all time!",7,1,6,2 January 2016
Patton," 'Would they sacrifice their best general . . . '

Scott, as Gen. George S. Patton, Jr., sniffs out Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's plot to cook up a decades-long post-WWII 'Cold War' with Russia to benefit the Military-Industrialists eager to anoint him as President I-Like-Ike. From the establishment of the totally bogus 'United Nations' to America's 8-war losing streak, PATTON strengthens your belief that most of our Troubles could have been avoided had not a Megalomaniacally jealous Eisenhower engineered PATTON's assassination-like demise. That a smirking Ike got away with this outrage gave Johnson, Nixon, and the Bushes--all present in Texas on 11-21-63--the blueprint they used to brazenly snuff JFK and facilitate 9-11. PATTON is portrayed as an idiot savant of War, lacking in key social and political survival skills as he prattles on about his various previous incarnations and poetry writing skills. On the other hand, Karl Malden embodies Gen. Omar Bradley as an Ike Toadie interested only in getting a tank named after himself.

Pawn Sacrifice," Now that even a second-string computer can beat Boris Spassky . . .
",". . . and Bobby Fischer at chess simultaneously, one might wonder if there's a reason to see a movie about people playing this obsolete game nearly 50 years ago. PAWN SACRIFICE is worth seeing since it documents how ONLY folks with serious brain defects can beat top-level Russians. Bobby Fischer is shown here using his paranoid schizophrenia to best Spassky, the pride of the U.S.S.R. Spassky's Russian 'Evil Empire' itself was briefly crushed a few years later by an Alzheimer's-riddled Ronnie Reagan. Now another Balkan Crazy, Vladimir 'Mad Dog' Putin, has arisen to threaten America on the World Chess Board, annexing U.S. allies left and right as the 'sane' desk jockeys in the White House and Pentagon merely sit back and dither about it. PAWN SACRIFICE tells us it's high time that we ask ourselves, 'WWBD?' If America remains stale and predictable, we'll lose. President 'I-Like-Ike' Eisenhower MADE the Jewish Fischer (and no doubt thousands of other boys--non-chess-savants--in his demographic) crazy by declaring a random Jewish mom named 'Ethel' from Bobby's mother's circle to be a Russian Master Spy, and electrocuting her THREE TIMES in the highly-publicized most gruesome state murder in American history. This 'MAD' policy of Ike's had the U.S.S.R. shaking in its boots, not knowing what insane tactic we might undertake next, as documented in THE BOOK OF DANIEL and elsewhere. One MUST fight fire with fire, PAWN SACRIFICE proves.",9,0,12,30 September 2015
Magic Mike XXL," HEDWIG famously possessed an ANGRY INCH . . .
",". . . but MAGIC MIKE XXL's more like a sleepy centimeter. In a sense, XXL is a spoof of a spoof. This is a dull, pale imitation of cable TV's Cinemax Channel's porn parodies. Instead of simulating wild sex with clothes OFF, we have XXL lamely hinting (with clothes mostly ON) at things that may have seemed a trifle risqué in the 1890s. Though it was somewhat difficult to follow XXL's pointless plot amid the snores of the Bachelorette Party to my right, the main climax of this flick comes when Channing Tatum gets Amber Howard to smile (something he probably could have accomplished in Real Life 110 minutes sooner by simply dropping his drawers for her in Warner Bros.' family assist lavatory). This Snooze-Athon builds up to some sort of 'competition' with NO winner, and NO opponents performing. XXL jumps the shark by bogging down for a seeming hour or two at Jada Pinkett Smith's bordello. Next it's over to Andie MacDowell's living room for another tedious eternity. (Smith and MacDowell no doubt are two of XXL's producers, or their molls.) Finally, Elizabeth Banks reprises her Queen of Snark role from the HUNGER GAMES and PITCH PERFECT series. Then the EMT's had to use paddles on one of the walker-bearing septuagenarian matrons seated to my left during this film to jump-start her awake enough to clear the theater.",3,12,23,7 July 2015
Hidden Figures," Racist Red State Toilet Laws delayed the U.S. Moon Landing . . .
",". . . by at least a year, HIDDEN FIGURES documents. Not only is HIDDEN FIGURES the Best Movie of 2016, but it's also the Most Important Film of the year (two distinctions which do not always overlap). HIDDEN FIGURES is the Best Movie because it's near-perfect in every way (and Taraji P. Henson as Katherine G. Johnson certainly deserves this year's Best Actress Oscar). Of more note, HIDDEN FIGURES is so important because it deals with issues still dominating Today's Headlines, upon which America's very survival as a Democracy depends. 'Dixie's' Capital, Virginia, is the setting for HIDDEN FIGURES, and the Confederate State just below it--North Carolina--is the current front line of the South's continuing nonsensical Toilet Wars. Incoming USA Czar, the Red Commie KGB Strongman Vlad 'Mad Dog' Putin, rigged our Election and activated our Racist Self-Destruct 'Electoral College' Loophole, to put the Deplorable Toilet Warriors in Power. The American Majority (that is, our average normal people with Common Sense living mostly in California, New York, and our Major Cities) know that Putin is destroying us because he cannot get over the fact that America won the Space Race, beating Russia to the Moon by 48 years and counting. So go see HIDDEN FIGURES, and then battle the Red Commie KGB Putin\Rump Party traitors Hell-bent upon PREVENTING America from ever being Great again!",10,2,9,19 January 2017

Pixar's COCO will not only entice your kids to welcome their Mexican friends, but will persuade many if not most tykes to want to BECOME Mexican themselves! COCO relates a Parable about Mexico's version of Elvis--Ernesto--who murders Hector, the REAL creative talent behind this pair of musicians' Wealth and Fame. As always, The Truth eventually struggles out. In Real Life America--especially at this time of year--the closest parallel to COCO is Anglophile Fat Cat Family Tory Scion Wolf-in-Preacher's-Clothing C. Clement Moore when he seized the credit, fame, and royalty wealth (of course) from the REAL 'Night Before Christmas' story-telling poet, Captain Henry Livingston, Jr., a Revolutionary War Hero and actual True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Progressive Union Label Man of the People. (The modest Hank was not one for tooting his own horn, leaving an opening for the gold-digging plagiarist Clem to brazenly steal authorship--NINE YEARS AFTER HANK DIED--of a lucrative rhyme published anonymously many years earlier; as Clem sank into dementia, he also claimed credit for having written 'Roses are red' and several books of the Holy Bible, too.) Please bring your tykes to COCO so that they can learn to distrust Big Business Bozos like the Disney Suits, and understand that True Art pretty much always comes from We 'Little People' like Hector; NOT from the grasping clutches of the Fat Cat Class, like Ernesto and C. Clement Moore!",10,1,7,4 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This flick tries to answer the flaming question . . .
",". . . 'Do holograms dream of shimmering sheep?' After surviving Mr. Ren's twenty-one hundred gun salute, Luke Skywalker's astral projection seems pretty stumped about what to do for its next trick. Blow up a Death Star? No, that would fill Hyperspace with too much needless debris. Take over the wheel of the Millennium Falcon from Han Solo's icy grip? No, again, the chicks have beaten him to that assignment (though it could plausibly pass as a Wookie now to sit in the copilot's seat). Just hang out and chill with Yoda? Wrong again that would be. It's as if Dorothy has returned to Oz, only to find that the Cowardly Lion has died from old age, the Tinman has one foot in his grave, and the Scarecrow's coming down with Alzheimer's. Sounds pretty grim, Huh? Maybe the Disney folks can find a way to monetize Youth. With Today's CGI, why can't they hire fresh young blood to say the 5,132 different words making up 99% of all movie scripts while performing the 78 basic Screen Movements and 41 possible facial expressions in front of a green screen? Then, by copyrighting these exclusive and versatile young talents forever, they'll have stars just as durably ageless and incorruptible as Steamboat Willie (aka, 'Mickey Mouse').",8,6,31,30 December 2017
Jurassic World," This fourth installment of the JURASSIC PURGE series . . .
",". . . could not be timed better. Russia has proved that if a country has a yearning for another peninsula, it can just snatch the one of its choice and no one else will do anything. Therefore, if you read between the lines, JURASSIC WORLD is suggesting that America and\or its multinational billionaires should latch onto an island few people would miss, such as Costa Rica or Hawaii. Step Two would be reviving new and improved dinosaurs through gene-splicing. (This is NOT far-fetched. Today's frequent deconstruction of robed people roaming the streets of yesteryear by means of drone-fired 'Hellfire' missiles--as in the current flick GOOD KILL--is far scarier than the most frightening UFO flicks of a few years ago.) Finally, as this movie states, 'No one's impressed with dinosaurs anymore.' But JURASSIC WORLD shows us that the average T-Rex must eat 30 or 40 people daily to survive. Since China and India each have a billion folks to spare, plus umpteen millions of excess Americans, soon we can expect an internet gold mine to be in operation live-streaming the daily arrival of 20,000 'Guests' for feeding time on a real JURASSIC WORLD island.",8,78,156,17 June 2015
Silence," As the Karma Chameleon always sings, 'What goes around . . . '
","' . . . comes around,' and SILENCE documents this fact better than most movies. Wikipedia repeats Japan's claim that 35,000 locals (minus at least 2,000 kidnapped Korean slaves) died as a result of Our U.S. Nuking of Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945. (The immediate context of this Big Blast, of course, was a decade of unprovoked misbehavior on the part of Japan, which raped China, Korea, and the Philippines, as well as Sneak-Attacking Hawaii and Alaska, while committing countless thousands of Barbarous Sadistic Perverted War Crimes in the process of Murdering Millions of innocent bystanders just trying to live their lives.) SILENCE documents the 300,000 fiendish deaths-by-torture inflicted upon Christians by the Tokugawa Shogunate during the 1600s, almost all in Nagasaki. (Though 537 of these Martyrs have been Canonized as Saints by the Romans, the other 299,463 have been lost to Heaven's History thanks to the lazy Japanese Authorities, who were much sloppier in documenting their Genocidal Massacres than were the anal-retentive Nazi Hooligans of World War Two.) SILENCE shows that these Miscreants of Nippon also were much more efficient at incinerating the evidence of their Hellish Outrages than was the Leiderhosen League. But as a keen student of History (advised by actual History Profs such as Newt Gingrich), do not be surprised if Leader Trump finds some pretext to nuke Nagasaki again. After all, they purged their gene pool of all the Worthy People 400 years ago, and the Karma Chameleon would seem to demand AT LEAST 265,00 more 'Pay Back' lives, multiplied by the usual factor of seven applicable to such Crimes against Civilization.",7,0,1,27 January 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Super Bozos Bring on the Clown-Pocalypse . . .

But even that brief span of Time proved long enough for Ultron to send the guy seated three spots to my right into La-La Land, as his sonorous snoring competed with the Surround Sound for the final hour of this flick. Obviously, providing hours of mental clutter-induced deep sleep is one of the Disney Mega-Corp's main goals in latching on to Marvel Studios. Soon Disney will merge the X-MEN and the AVENGERS into one film, guaranteed to send sleep-deprived members of Big Families or those with apartments next to the El into an elusive snooze after the first 20 minutes of endless 'super hero' introductions involving the exchange of birth names, Noms De Guerre, aliases, and 'pet' monikers. Instead of blaring country music non-stop at America's terrorist rendition 'Black Sites,' the psychological warfare torturers will be able to alternate between twang and Marvel movies.",7,5,12,4 May 2015
Everest," EVEREST deals primarily with the pollution problem . . .
",". . . facing the main Nepalese national park, which is now littered with hundreds of human corpses. I personally have hiked ALL the trails--maintained and 'abandoned'--from the South Rim to the Colorado River in America's comparable leisure area, the Grand Canyon, and I've never seen so much as ONE human stiff cluttering a pathway there. (Several of my hikes were in the vicinity of a pack mule who had plunged to its death--or expired from old age and been kicked over the side by the wrangler--one mid-summer, and even THAT isolated carrion rarity stands out as an exceptionally odoriferous memory.) The Nepalese, on the other hand, have allowed the world's most famous peak to become festooned not only with the bodies of a plethora of suicidal rich Western geezers, but also with many tons of human waste, which constitutes a global disgrace. EVEREST glosses over this fecal nightmare, but it cannot sweep this mountain's wall-to-wall carpeting of cadavers under the rug. No one would hike into the Grand Canyon if the experience combined the outhouse scene from SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE with the set decoration for HOUSE OF 1001 CORPSES. It's surprising that the Nepalese cooperated as much as they did here in exposing their national disgrace--it seems likely some form of 'ambush journalism' was involved. Normal people do not see anything 'heroic' about carelessly losing hands and noses while visiting a once-pristine world treasure, but leave it to a Texan to shell out $65,000 for the 'privilege' of doing exactly that!",8,1,3,4 October 2015
La La Land," 'Oh well, at least we'll always have L.A. . . . '

'LA LA LAND' answers the question, 'What if Sam were a White dude, and smoke NEVER got in his eyes, and he had a fling with Ilsa BEFORE she met Victor and Rick, would they have lived 'Happily Ever After'? (SPOILER ALERT: The answer is 'NO! Some things are just not to be.') For those of us who plodded through director Ken Burns one-man Jackie Robinson show (aka, BASEBALL) and lacked the patience to give his #42 follow-up JAZZ a listen, LA LA LAND doubtless is a more moving homage to the Pride of New Orleans (and probably about 60 hours shorter, to boot). It's also the 21st Century's Top Tribute to the attractions of 1900s Hollywood (especially the Fred Astaire\Ginger Rogers flicks). One can only hope that Ryan Gosling is Reteamed enough times with Emma Stone that they stumble across a LA LA LAND gin joint in which Gosling actually gets the girl.",10,3,8,17 January 2017
Snowden," Director Oliver Stone cleverly tricks 'Saint' Edward . . .

Later he blew the whistle on W.'s enabling 9-11 in order to wage a $2 trillion personal vendetta costing 5,000-plus U.S. lives and causing upwards of one million Iraqi deaths, among Oliver's many previous accomplishments. With SNOWDEN, Stone reveals that the CIA and NSA exercise nepotism in hiring Special Olympic-type kids of Washington Insiders (Edward's grandpa was an Admiral) with major brain conditions such as Ed's epilepsy to supposedly 'keep us safe' when they're not too busy playing video games or fiddling with Rubik's Cubes. Stone further discloses that SNOWDEN has endangered the U.S. capacity to instantly destroy the power grids and banking systems of Japan, Germany, Australia, Mexico, and Canada the next time they decide to attack us. As Corbin, the American Patriot dude Stone presents here as both the Real Hero and Main Victim of this saga, says 'Most Americans don't want Freedom--they want Security.' Stone takes a stand at the end of this flick, assuring us that the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election will allow Leader Trump to 'flip the switch' on ALL of the SNOWDEN computer programs from 'Politically Correct' to their 'Maximum Security' settings.",10,2,10,19 September 2016
Woman in Gold," 'What do you do with a problem like Maria?'
","That may be a song title about a different Real Life 'Maria' from THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but Maria Altmann proved a more costly defection for Austrians than Maria Von Trapp, to the tune of $200 million and the permanent loss of the so-called 'Austrian Mona Lisa,' the title character here, Adele Bloch-Bauer. More than 100,000 art works looted from Europe's murdered six million Jews hang on the walls of that continent's museums today, state WOMAN IN GOLD's end notes. This movie tells how porcine Mrs. Hermann Goering (the Nazi's First Lady of Propaganda and Anti-Semitism) personally wore Adele's necklace from the portrait throughout WWII (even though Maria had inherited the necklace from Adele when Gustav Klimt's commissioned portrait model died in 1925). This flick proves that Continental European Culture (including Einstein, Freud, and a host of others) was primarily Jewish at the time of WWII. Therefore, though Maria got her five Klimt paintings back through arbitration, the reparations are NOT finished. When you multiply her $200 million in blood money times the 12 million people alive today with a connection to the Holocaust victims, it comes out to a staggering $2.4 quadrillion--MORE than Europe is presently worth. Therefore, now that people have had a chance to catch their breath after WWII, there needs to be a U.N.-managed Exodus of non-Jews from that evil continent. EVERY Nazi-occupied country where at least one Jew was murdered MUST be turned over to the government of Israel within 90 days. With an entire Jewish Continent to oversee by the end of 2015, Israel's pragmatic leaders will vacate the Middle East forthwith, and we'll all have world peace in our time!",10,3,7,12 April 2015

That's why they target the World's 'Arsenal of Democracy'--the Big D--their nemesis, for libel and vilification in DON'T BREATHE. This hatchet job depicts a part of Hungary where many adjacent city blocks rot virtually abandoned (a situation nonexistent in the English-speaking Real World, outside of a MAD MAX flick), and attempt to foist off this Hell Hole as our fifth largest U.S. Metropolis (according to the latest reference book in the Detroit branch library I patronized on my recent visit to Motown). I just toured America's Motor City during the 'Woodward Dream Cruise,' and enjoyed a steady stream of Detroit's GTO's, Corvettes, Mustangs, and Chargers roaring by. Sony shows the turkey-basted mother-to-be 'Rocky' driving in something like a Hungarian Yugo, that cannot even keep the dogs out. These mendacious propagandists also slander our Undefeated U.S. Army heroes, depicting them as Ticking Time Bomb Serial Killers. It pictures a squalid Detroit beset with WHITE-ON-WHITE crime (which smacks of Hungary to me).

Beauty and the Beast," Hermione Granger courageously tackles her First Major Muggle Movie Role . . .

Disney produces its best flick of the decade, highlighted by a perfect blend of vocals channeling Joel Grey's CABARET emcee and visuals mimicking Busby Berkeley's kaleidoscopic choreography in the 'Be Our Guest' extravaganza. However, the most daring component of BEAST is ripped from Today's Headlines. Disney goes out on the limb of risking a charge of political incorrectness by suggesting that not all Gay Guys are Good. Tinseltown has toed this party line for decades, with Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Stanley & Livingston, the Lone Ranger & Tonto, right through to Butch & Sundance. However, the Gay Blade Gaston is clearly the Real Villain of BEAST, as even his Bi- Belly-Hickeyed Paramour LeFou comes to realize. Not only that, but Disney makes it Crystal Clear to even America's toddlers that Gaston's pursuit of Belle to become his 'beard' (or 'trophy wife') is a perfect parallel to Don Juan Trump's exploitation of U.S. Third Lady Melania. About 96 minutes into this film Disney puts Trump's most notable Campaign Catch-Phrase ('Lock Her Up!!') into Gaston's mouth (referencing Belle), and turns the gullible villagers into a crazed mob indistinguishable from a Red State Trump Rally.",10,3,13,21 March 2017
Sicario," SICARIO documents the need to immediately move . . .

If we were being informed of what's ACTUALLY happening in places such as Chandler, AZ (where SICARIO shows how Mexican cartel members slaughtered 42 random American collegians and dry-walled them in a single suburban home in observance of pagan customs) EVERY U.S. citizen (except maybe those like the sniveling, bleeding-heart, 'by-the-book' FBI agent cry-baby and drug-lord enabler played in SICARIO by Emily Blunt) would be demanding AT LEAST a 100-mile-wide No Go Zone down South. As SICARIO proves, our 'border' presently is riddled with drug terrorist tunnels, and any crime-lord committing genocide against America can buy his way out of detention by bribing the 'authorities' of this totally corrupt society (as happened this summer with the prison tunnel guy). Maybe some Americans have forgotten that we already have 'won' the entire 'nation' of Mexico in the Battle of Vera Cruz. As the U.N. mandates, 'to the victor go the spoils.' That 100-mile-wide No-Go buffer zone now features little but squalor and human suffering. When it's totally depopulated (and policed 24/7/365 by the U.S. Air Force and drone program), Americans will be MUCH better off, and Mexicans won't be any worse.

"McFarland, USA"," Border of Dreams . . .

Disney's actual name for this film probably is meant to be ironic, as is the character's name played by America's favorite FIELD OF DREAMS 'jock flick' actor, Kevin Costner ('Mr. White,' a.k.a., 'Senor Blanco' here). McFARLAND USA documents that as far back as the 1900s there were parts of America which spoke Mexican, ate Mexican, drank Mexican, worked Mexican, played Mexican, drove Mexican, partied Mexican, fought Mexican, ran Mexican, and were flagged Mexican. Since then this situation has been greatly magnified, so viewers of McFARLAND USA won't be able to avoid realizing the obvious solution. The sooner the better, the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, and Oklahoma MUST be spun off as a separate country. This six-state area could be called 'Sunnyside.' Cross country running could be Sunnyside's national pastime. On Sunnyside's initial Independence Day, ALL residents of these half dozen states would become charter members (that is, legal citizens) of Sunnyside. No muss, no fuss.

Back in the 1900s, when SPIDERMAN and X-MEN flicks were something novel, the World's Leading Auto Makers fought tooth & nail for the 'privilege' of a few seconds' grill time for their latest prototype models. Though the end credits for GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOL. 2 exercise some wishful thinking by implying that Marvel's sagging franchise MIGHT have even more pale sequels and spin-offs up their withered sleeves, one hates to think of what dying products from the previous century will be content to risk a few hundred bucks to hawk their cob-webbed wares with a Big Screen Last Hurrah. Preparation H, perhaps? (This might be a good fit for Stakar Ogord.) Drax may appreciate some Alka-Seltzer after a hard day of belly-diving. Gamora could imagine that she's back on Pandora in her Maidenform Brassiere. Surely a Zoot Suit would suit Groot.

The Disaster Artist," I had heard that someone was making a third remake of . . .
",". . . A STAR IS BORN, and I think that it is a stroke of genius for director\star James Franco to dispense with the shop-worn Janet Gaynor\Julie Garland\Barbra Streisand title and opt in favor of the less ironic and more apt heading for his project, which also uses the device of ingenious gender-neutral casting: THE DISASTER ARTIST. Among other winning moves on Franco's part is dragging this tired tale out of its ruts into Our 21st Century by adding to the usual STAR IS BORN-type yarn Gay undercurrents, themes of sexual harassment, and cutting-edge insights slicing through the idiocy of America's Monied Class. The latter point makes it clear why the USA's People's Studio--Warner Bros.--successfully bid to distribute THE DISASTER ARTIST. So far no one has produced a script which more accurately epitomizes the so-called Administration of current U.S. Strongman Vlad Putin. All it would take to convert THE DISASTER ARTIST into something perfectly analogous to our present-day Real Life Travails is stirring in a few thousand irrational Tweets to the stew of 'Tommy's' madness.

Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It's as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal. This film does more to show Evil Triumphant than any movie Hitler's Videographer, Leni Riefenstahl, ever churned out.

Steve Jobs," 'Just be evil!' is the legacy of this man and his products . . .

STEVE JOBS is a wonderfully cast and acted movie, with witty writing, sharp editing, and great cinematography (particularly the close-up of Jobs' face as Andy lingers in the blurry background about 1:29:30 into this story). The plotting and editing of STEVE JOBS cuts to the chase incisively, boiling down the 14-year period from 1984 (and Apple's prophetic 'MacIntosh' Super Bowl ad, forecasting how billions of iJobs ditto heads world-wide would morph into the Nazi sheep in the seats and NOT the sledge hammer-throwing chick!) to three key days, with a sprinkling of flashbacks and a generous use of composite characters. Coupled with THE SOCIAL NETWORK's documenting the Life and Crimes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, JOBS shows that you do NOT need the fake villains of WALL STREET's Gordon 'Greed is Good' Gecko or GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Kevin Spacey to prove that most if not all of America's One Per Cent mogul class are in league with the Devil. While flicks such as STEVE JOBS and SOCIAL NETWORK may feature 'feel good' endings to put butts into theater seats, one cannot ignore the human carnage projected on-screen wreaked by the Zuckerbergs, Jobs, and Trumps plaguing today's America. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen) tells Jobs 'It's not binary--you can be decent and talented at the same time.' Though that's probably True, what actually IS binary is that you CANNOT be both decent AND an American mogul. Some guys decide to become serial killers.

",". . . by machines rising out of the ground to attack him? Perhaps it began most famously with TOP GUN in 1986, when his 'Maverick' character was just moseying along in a jet, only to be assaulted by surface-to-air missiles. Then in 2002's MINORITY REPORT, Cruise's 'Chief John Anderton' incarnation was pursued by spidery metal eyeballs scurrying across floors to spy on him. Most people thought the culmination of robotic attacks from beneath upon Mr. Cruise would be WAR OF THE WORLDS in 2005, when massive machine-bound aliens awoke from millenniums of sleep underground just because Tom's 'Ray Ferrier' was walking over their 'graves.' No such luck. Where Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s 'Rod Tidwell' character loudly demanded that Cruise's 1996 JERRY MAGUIRE title sports agent 'Show me the money!,' Tom must yell at his own agent to 'Show me the sneaky robots!' If you cross MINORITY REPORT spiders with the WAR OF THE WORLD robot suits, you get the 'meteorite attackers' for EDGE OF TOMORROW. Though simple calculations prove that the mass of all the spider-bots shown in EDGE OF TOMORROW would have required a space object twice the size of Manhattan to contain them all (which would have been detected by astronomers years from earth, and blown to smithereens by our nuclear shield), who expects realism from Tom Cruise flicks?",7,1,3,7 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," 'Your sweat smells like cinnamon . . . '
",". . . may be stereotypical L Words, but PITCH PERFECT 2 tops its predecessor as the most harmonious A Cappella flick ever. The Germans shape up so well in the early going that their eventual showdown with the Barden Belles seems sure to be a David versus Goliath affair, fought entirely on a totally sandy shore this time. Put another way, it's the Nazi Blitzkrieg against France. At my showing, film goers were on the edge of their seats, fearing that the Na--oops, that the Germans would win, or, worse, that the Belles would be called the winners on some sort of technicality, when they had been clearly out-classed. However, due to clever writing and innovative thinking, this sequel produces a crowd-pleasing climax that seems not only plausible but well-earned. Though the life of these Belles beyond their competitions still seems a little too pat and Tinsel Townish, their Hollywood ending on the World Stage is 100% satisfying.",10,37,68,1 June 2015
It Chapter Two," From its opening horrendous homophobic homicidal harbinger . . .
",". . . to its depiction of demonic attacks upon our American Homeland, it's clear that the always eponymous Warner Bros. prophets are warning the USA against more than sinister sewer grates with IT CHAPTER TWO. Obviously, IT's 'Derry' town is meant to represent ALL of the deplorable 'Red State' sectors of the U.S. here. With its ubiquitous red balloons, pervasive bigotry, and mindless ballyhoo, viewers may well feel that they are in the midst of a rump cushion mob campaign rally. 'Beverly's' dad addresses her in the same icky bone-chilling terms used by the Pachyderm Party's Real Life 'Don Juan' about his OWN 'Buy Her Stuff' daughter of the infamous 'Howie Stern' program interview. Certainly the Power Balls controlling 'Pennywise' throughout IT 2 will put audiences in mind of the KGB Masters pulling Don Juan's strings. Does Warner Bros. hold out any hope, then, that Evil Clowns usurping power can be defeated? Yes! The Warner prognosticators show us that IF the lying bozos are publicly demeaned, derided, belittled, shamed, minimized, and marginalized by Brave Truth Tellers, they will shrink, self-destruct or self-deport!",8,5,10,10 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," The Coen Brothers argue for the Union Label . . .

This film is virtually 'Breaking News,' with its late focus on Michigan's water crises, now being investigated by the United Nations Genocide Dept. (The Wolverine's 'Capital Party'--used as a movie studio name by the Coens--decreed that Unappointed town dictators poison Labor Party voters in Flint with lead and Legionnaire's Disease, while cutting off water altogether to Blue Collar Balloteers in Detroit.) The agenda of the Coen Brothers' Jesus is Clean Water for All, as shown in their movie. This platform weans George Clooney's lead character away from his Gay Campaign to whole-hearted support for the Socialist Workers' Cause. Some Americans still don't realize that our two strongest Labor Unions are the Screen Actors' Guild (Ronald Reagan was an early SAG president) and the Major League Baseball Players' Union. Both of these working stiffs' groups fully subscribe to the Socialists' Prime Directive: 'To each, according to his ability, and from each, depending upon his tax lawyer.'

12 Strong," Warner Bros. works valiantly to help Americans 'connect the dots' . . .
",". . . about our 21st Century History with 12 STRONG. Early on during 12 STRONG we are treated to a view of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin muttering about unleashing his rabid mutt Osama Bin Laden against America. Later, the Weasel's defense secretary Rumsfeld is shown swallowing Putin's bait about 'Weapons of Mass Destruction' to lure the U.S. into another disastrous quagmire. Between Afghanistan and Iraq (the proverbial gap separating a rock from a hard place), America has seen 10,000 of our own slain, 100,000 wounded, with a price tag of Three TRILLION bucks and counting. This is a far greater toll than that racked up by Russia in Afghanistan, and the Soviet Bear's modest losses were enough to rip apart the U.S.S.R. in into 15 pieces. 'Afghanistan is where Empires go to die,' the characters of 12 STRONG say in various ways at least seven times during this Docudrama. America has lost the War against Afghanistan just as surely as the campaign against Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam, with the past few days seeing two attacks in that failed nation's capital, the first of which killed two dozen at what passes for a 'luxury' hotel and the second tearing more that 100 locals limb from limb. Tet Uprising, anyone? Any day now 'Osama Bin Ladenville' will join 'Ho Chi Minh City' as a world capital. If failed president Jimmy Carter had just done something useful (like nuking Iran, Russia, and Afghanistan) instead of boycotting the Olympics, we would not be in our sorry state Today, 12 STRONG suggests. The World would still have too many -Stans underfoot, but the U.S. would be a lot better off!",9,8,24,30 January 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Anyone with more than a couple 'gray cells' will recognize this remake as the clearest call yet . . .
",". . . for 'regime change' in Washington, DC. Think about it. Half-Heartedly disguised as a 'Period Piece' dabbling in a case similar to The Lindbergh Baby Kidnapping, why on Earth does it trash the original's popular 'justice is served format' by allowing multiple killers to get off 'Scott Free' from a Julius Caesar Ides-of-March mass-stabbing political assassination? You just have to ask yourself, which two Real Life people from the 1900s are mentioned here? Johnny Depp tells Kenneth Branagh that the only OTHER famous person he's met was when 'I once rode a bus with Ty Cobb in Detroit.' The remaining Real Life references are to Josef Stalin, one of current Red Commie KGB Boss Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin's ancestors as Russkie Strongmen. Therefore, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS's REAL focus is entirely on Putin's White House Sock-Puppet-in-Chief, Don Juan Rump, since it singles out Rump's current criminal lawyer--Ty Cobb (who happens to be some sort of descendant of the Honest Ty Cobb)--and Rump's boss, Stalin heir Putin. Therefore, the cast and crew of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS are telling us that our beleaguered Homeland, America, IS the Orient Express, Scar-faced Gangster Johnny Depp is playing Rump, and it's up to each and every one of us to come prepared to the table for our long overdue 'Night of the Long Knives!'",8,0,10,13 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Since its start, Universal has been America's Monster Movie Studio . . .
",". . . which makes THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS par for Universal's course. When most people think of monsters, Frankenstein, Dracula, Godzilla, and Hitler are among the first to come to mind. If you specify American monsters, Bigfoot, the Boogie Man, Candyman, and The Duke are on the tips of everyone's tongues. PETS cleverly provides animated documentation of Duke's decades-long rampage through American Life and Culture during the 1900s, as the usurper of U.S. dog Max's Home Sweet Home. (If you're not up on 1900s American History, a boy named Marion got depressed over his Ma running out on his dying Pa and renamed himself after the family mutt, as 'Duke (Mad Dog) Wayne.' Shortly thereafter, this struggling cheap-flick 'singing cowboy' was recruited to the Dark Side by the American Fascist Party, where he literally fingered thousands of Real Life Working Stiffs for bankruptcy, political prisons, 'suicide,' and premature death as the self-appointed U.S. Snitch-in-Chief.) In PETS, gluttonous Big Dawg Duke steals Max's food, bed, and mistress before turning Max over to dogcatchers. It would take an entire book to itemize all the tie-ins between PETS' plot and characters with America's All-Time Leading Monster, Duke 'Mad Dog' Wayne.",8,11,20,11 July 2016
Finding Dory," Of all the gin joints in the World, Cleveland . . .
",". . . definitely is NOT a random destination of no return for Pixar's FINDING DORY. The first 90 minutes or so of DORY feature some of the gloomiest gray animation ever to come to the Big Screen, such as the 15 minutes she spends lost in the corroded pipes. The parents reassuring their young kids at my showing seemed to be muttering about whether this was a wrong-headed exercise in doom and gloom for its own sake. My guess is 'No,' it was more than that. Think about it. Attentive viewers will notice that there are 56 species of ocean life depicted in DORY, ranging in numbers from a mere handful to more than 100. It's no accident that this is exactly the number of U.S. states and territories--along with Washington, DC--and these numbers dovetail with the relative strength of each delegation making travel plans to the Republican National Convention this summer in CLEVELAND!! When all of the cartoon delegation's aquariums finally hit the freeway toward the Buckeye state in DORY, she and her bound-to-Trump pals desperately plunge their transport truck into the ocean, Unbinding these wavering or lukewarm delegates once and for all. Trump's Clump of Wild Orangish Hair makes a cameo appearance just then in the form of bushy seaweed at the 1:26:15 mark (just before the end credits).",7,1,9,23 June 2016
Arrival," ARRIVAL explains exactly WHY Leader Trump won the White House . . .
",". . . as it combines the nonlinear time element of SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE with the romance-midst-the-aliens theme of THE ABYSS. Trump's Red State voters are stuck in the 1900s, listening to AM radio all the time. In the two weeks before the Election, perhaps the most popular radio show--COAST-TO-COAST--was quoting and discussing all the hacked Wikileaks from Hillary's Right-Hand Man, John Podesta, and his insistence that ALL the terabytes the U.S. Government is concealing on Our Alien Presence would be dumped on the General Public Hillary's First Week in Office. Leader Trump and the Red Staters KNOW that the Wall Street Clowns (not to mention the citizens of backwards countries such as Canada, France, and Germany) CANNOT HANDLE THIS TRUTH! Therefore, millions of COAST-TO-COAST listeners (even college educated women) made it their mission to thwart Podesta's (and, by extension, Hillary's) crazed plan to blow the whistle on Our Real Life Alien Presence. Since NOT ONE of the TV pundits has ever tuned in to COAST-TO-COAST (many lack cars, let alone car radios), they're grasping at straws to explain Leader Trump's Election 'Surprise,' being totally in the dark about the REAL reason for Trump's Triumph. ARRIVAL carefully documents the world-wide chaos (such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 2,000 points in one day!) that the Posdesta\Hillary team would have wreaked against us IF all the Red State radio listeners had not Saved America!",10,2,19,17 November 2016

It's an absolute ordeal for the ordinary normal average Koreans to keep a set of dry work clothes available in order to perform their low-paid menial jobs for the monied PARASITE Class wallowing in the conspicuous consumption of their ill-gotten Wealth. These work environments are flagrantly unsafe. When employees perish, the Miser Clique dismisses them like squashed bugs and hire replacement victims, complaining all the time about the Smell of Squalor to which they condemn their fellow man.

The Big Short," As $5 trillion was stolen and 200,000 Middle Class Americans slain . . .

Since these Banks bought Obama, W., Congress, and ALL Federal Courts and 'Bank Regulators,' these Bank Robbers (that is, robbers running Banks) divvied up an extra $5 trillion on top of their chump change 8-figure annual bonuses. THE BIG SHORT shows that these Bankers own the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the rest of U.S. Media, which is why the outrageous story of these 200,000 Banker murders and 8 million stolen homes is almost totally suppressed right up till today, and not a peep of citizen outrage hits the media. As long as Americans have to claw tooth and nail to keep their TVs going from one meager paycheck to the next, no one has a moment to question the System. We callously dismiss our killed-off brothers and sisters, as well as homeless parents and kids as cases of 'bad luck,' or the 'cost of doing business' for the 'privilege' of breathing in America. When the Banks say 'Jump!' we simply quiver, 'How high?' We cannot organize, since the Banks own all the media. THE BIG SHORT suggests that a few thousand (or hundred) Big Bankers will continue to doom the rest of us to increasingly tiny, hopeless, more squalid existences. We Nation of Sheep probably will simply cross our fingers and hope to be dead the next time Bankers have an itch to steal $5--or $50--trillion in one fell swoop.",8,5,8,30 December 2015

It's especially shocking that the Vatican seems to be talking out of both sides of its mouth this Spring. On the one hand, the Pope is raising a ruckus by insisting that the Turks 'Fess up to their Crimes against Humanity. On the other, His representatives on the U.S. MPAA Film Censoring Board (see *THIS MOVIE IS NOT YET RATED) have NOT slowed the advance of Mr. Crowe's wrong-headed revisionism into the American multiplex by giving THE WATER DIVINER its kiss-of-death, the NC-17 rating.

As WONDER WOMAN says, 'Only Love will save the World.' But she adds, 'Maybe some people are NOT Good,' in reference to the 80 million Deplorable Putin/Rump Enablers who MUST be deported North to Canada for a Seven-Generation Cooling Off Period (not unlike Dr. Miru's exile from the Bulk of Decent Humanity as WONDER WOMAN closes). Warner Bros.' implicit message is that only when that moldy Racist Suicide Pact on Parchment from the 1700s is REPEALED AND REPLACED at a Constitutional Convention will our WONDER WOMAN Statue of Liberty be able to curtail Lucifer's interchangeable Three C's: Conservatism, Communism, and corrupt job-killing Capitalism by permanently banning ALL corporations with their proclivity to nurture Ares/Putin's Poison Gas War Machine!",8,3,10,6 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Since France conceals its military tactics . . .
",". . . to maintain a strategic advantage, it's up to Americans such as Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas--the PATHS OF GLORY creators--to expose the secrets of French military success. Many of these tips involve execution by firing squad. When you face embarrassment from whistle blowers such as Edward Snowden and Monica Lewinsky, just shoot them (like Corporal Phillip Paris here). Since decorated war heroes such as SERGEANT YORK or that Pennsylvania Marine who gunned down his ex-wife and her family this week, can become post-war liabilities, just shoot them before the war ends (like Private Pierre Renaud's fate here). With the high cost of medical care, when soldiers are wounded in battle, why award them Purple Hearts, when you can just finish the job the Enemy started and shoot them (like Private Maurice Ferol here), even if you need to strap their stretcher to the execution post and slap them out of a comatose state (Private Renaud's fate here)? This French approach to Military Discipline virtually eliminates the need for veterans' benefits and V.A. hospitals, while insuring sterling reputations for the general staff Muckety-Mucks. True, it takes a lot of bullets (nine per soldier) and sandbags to do things the French Way, as depicted in PATHS OF GLORY. Maybe the guillotine would be cheaper.",8,0,1,20 December 2014
Straight Outta Compton," One of the best documentaries on the Decline & Fall of America . . .
",". . . STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON links the Unprintably-named N.W.A. gang to most all the U.S. social ills of the past 30 years. Why, just this summer two home-grown American shooters--one Black and one White--tied their massacres to an on-going Race War, which many if not most Americans believe is being covered up by our government and media. COMPTON makes clear that its Mob of Seven intentionally began this ruckus to sell rap 'music' to the bored Youth of the Monied Races. (N.W.A. is shown to be in cahoots with Jewish people in their plot, and this anti-Semitic angle will give Eichmann--wherever he is--a good laugh.) The N.W.A. Seven are portrayed as the instigators of today's shoot-a-cop craze, which claimed its latest victim on the day I saw COMPTON. (This grass roots terrorist movement is shown reaching a fever pitch in Detroit, which declared bankruptcy after N.W.A.'s visit.) As many if not most of today's 'law enforcement' officers spend the majority of their time cowering inside the relative safety of their police posts, N.W.A.'s rampant drug dealing, AIDS-spreading sex orgies, and reckless driving faithfully depicted in this flick make it a deadly mission for a normal person to attempt a milk run to their nearest store. COMPTON documents how this metal ball bat wielding thug behavior has thoroughly eaten away and trashed America's soul. You'll never get on an elevator alone with someone who looks like a 'rapper,' and you'll cross to the other side of your street when you see them approaching, after you've witnessed and learned the lessons of COMPTON.",9,0,24,3 September 2015
Mother!," It's said that, 'Insanity is the Mother of Invention' . . .
",". . . and this Famous Aphorism seldom has been borne out more explicitly than with writer\director Darren Aronofsky's MOTHER! After all, once the World possesses BOTH of the movies STAGECOACH and PORKY'S, what could prompt anyone to produce yet another flick?! However, Mr. Aronofsky not only insists upon churning out one yawner after another, but he has the unmitigated gall to brazenly attempt melding key elements of both STAGECOACH and PORKY'S into his misbegotten MOTHER! Though there's a birthing scene toward the end of MOTHER!, as there is in the final half of STAGECOACH, the Advent of Darren's Baby is a tedious exercise in the use of heavy-handed religious symbolism by way of comparison. And while MOTHER! probably has more peep-holes and voyeuristic themes than PORKY'S, they come off as totally sophomoric and lame-brained when put up against the thrills of that Campus Classic. Probably Earthlings would be much better off in the long run if we all sacrifice a few bucks and send the stimulus-deprived Mr. Aronofsky video disks of cinema masterworks such as STAGECOACH and PORKY'S.

Warner Bros.' prophetic prognosticators use the Moscow ring showdown at the close of CREED II to show exactly why NOW is the time to call the bluff of the Russian Rabble. For nearly a century the infamous U.S. Military-Industrial Complex has been hard at work maintaining the hoax that Russian submarines, missiles, troops, and bombers are a threat to those of America. However, CREED II proves that when you punch these over-rated Commie boars in their snout, they will cave to the canvas immediately. Warner's seers warn us that IF America allows a Moscow pawn in our Oval Office to duck the KGB challenge, the World will vacate America's title and award it to the Chinese who are now waiting in the wings to triumphantly slurp through America's drinking straw!

That's because Superman's Red Cape and Blue Onesie ARE part of his Birthday Suit (making him a good bet to win any game of strip poker). Perhaps the biggest revelation of VERSUS is that the moms of every D.C. Comic 'Super Hero' are named 'Martha,' just like the Mother of Our Country (Mrs. Washington). That's because the D.C.

Many movies have focused upon so-called 'Freaks versus Geeks' conflicts in modern U.S. high schools (as frequently explored by Zac Efron--aka, the Greatest Showman, Jr., here--in the aforementioned TV series). However, GREATEST SHOWMAN explicates explosive epic battles between freaks and GREEKS more than 100 years ago (if you define fraternity brother types building their mansions to resemble Greek Temples filled with fake Greek sculptures as being 'Greek'). As they still do Today, these Monied Frat Boys use the news media that they own and control to rile up We 'the masses' by inventing Sex Police and other bogus, quasi-religious 'social issues' to seduce some of Barnum's fellow 'Riff Raff' into torching his theater.

The movie makers seem to be saying something along the lines of, 'Let go of the past, and let the Dead bury the Dead.' Just as Cruz and Bush must drop out to let Rubio thump Trump, the SON OF SAUL people are arguing that the Israelites should throw their lot in with the Crusaders to win a Final Victory in the Middle East. That's why they have written a script in which ALL the flag bearers for the Star of David perish, including half a dozen rabbis. Though Saul is shown digging graves for his son here, there, and everywhere, this movie prognosticates that in the end it's just a matter of 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust.' There's a Chinese Proverb that counsels, 'If you can't lick them, join them.' Which is what hundreds of Nazi detainees have done here in agreeing to be 'Sondercommandos.' Instead of forcing the Nazis to do their own lying and dirty work, these 'cleaners' self-police to desecrate their own dead so efficiently that Hitler's minions can slay twice as many of their People in half the time.

This is a dead giveaway that Disney MegaBlobCorp intends on forcing AT&T to spin off Master Potter's Warner Bros. Studio to the House of Louse as the price of regulatory approval for AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner. That way, the D-Blob will swallow up Warner's Potter Properties, just as they devoured Pixar, the Muppets, ESPN, ABC, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars. Anytime now we can expect a flick to hit the Big Screens in which Mordo sets his sights on Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Disney Multiverse.

Perhaps the Disney Blob will release what amounts to a gooey glob, but it cannot be much cheesier than the psychedelic Outer Space DOCTOR STRANGE spin on GROUNDHOG DAY.

This flick's trailer contains ALL of SHADOWS' few humorous moments, so this feature itself becomes an exercise in tedium that makes the viewers feel 8,000 years old, like vampire Peter. Few movie-goers will manage to stay awake throughout this snooze-test, unless they have brought along a 'familiar' to keep them occupied in the movie theater's shadows. SHADOWS comes from New Zealand. If you thought that THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT were a hoot, then you might bust a gut watching SHADOWS. But if you expect this entire show to build upon its trailer in a clever way, you most likely will be disappointed.

I guess that that's what happens when you're bored with the 18 billion names already given to Real Life People on our planet (including Rocky Rhodes and Chastity Bordello), and you concoct an infinity of Alternate Universes. Because the Artist Formerly Known as Prince already has exhausted Society's patience for Hieroglyphical Names, since numeric monikers become monotonous after about three digits (just try to imagine telling someone that two social security numbers kissed each other), and with names composed of random letters (such as a-s-d-f-g-h-j-k-l) largely viewed as being both crude and unwieldy, Marvel is forced to resort to the DEADPOOLS of this world. With Ryan Reynolds making a couple of post-credits appearances here to promise a DEADPOOL sequel including new Super Hero characters, I'm willing to contribute a few free suggestions to the obviously depleted Marvel Brain Trust. First off, 'Braintruss' seems perfect (sort of like a jockstrap for your mind). As Marvel values testosterone so highly, why NOT add 'Jockstrap' and 'Testes' to its Pantheon, as well? They'd make a great team. Finally, I once ran across an 'Alice' limerick that could provide Marvel with a real thumper--they only have to beat out D.C.

",". . . but KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is even more important for its vicious critique of and poetic justice for the One Per Cent. In spoofing Bond, KINGSMAN touches all the bases with its own twists. Secret agent trainee 'Eggsy' names his obligatory pooch 'J.B.'--not for Bond or James Bond wannabe (if he could just remember) Jason Bourne, but for Fox TV's loose cannon Jack Bauer. There are takes on the Bond gizmo's, the Bond martini, the 'Bond girls' (Eggsy's are no holes barred), the Bond one-liners, the Bond villains, the Bond villains' mutant-like Henchpeople, the Bond predicaments, the Bond implausible escapes, the Bond outer space Hijinks, the Bond villains' verbal diarrhea, the MI6 elaborate hideouts, the villains' more elaborate hideouts, etc. David Niven's CASINO ROYALE Bond spoof was a total mess, and the Austin Powers series was ALL tongue-in-cheek spoof, laying it on way too thick most of the time. KINGSMAN hits a more perfect balance of wry, self-conscious (and often self-proclaimed) homage, and a movie with plots and characters the viewer can take somewhat seriously.Regarding the One Per Cent, is it too much of a 'spoiler' to say to watch carefully when 'Pomp and Circumstance' starts playing in order to see Barack Obama's head explode? Unfortunately, in most of the 23 Eon Company Bond flicks out so far, Agent 007 only looks out for the interest of the One Per Cent, everyone else be darned. Refreshingly, KINGSMAN is just the opposite. When Samuel L. Jackson's villain comes up with the idea that a few billion 'little people' need to be 'culled' (or purged, for those of you non-lobster eaters), he has absolutely no trouble convincing most of the world's 'elite' to go along with his plan to create more elbow room. ALL of the villain's Rich and Powerful collaborators' heads explode in a Candyland sort of way toward the close of KINGSMAN, thanks to Eggsy and his allies. Jack Bauer could be counted upon to behead a baddie or two, but it was just one at a time. KINGSMAN goes Bauer and the Fox TV thousands of times better. (What else would you expect from Twentieth Century Fox?).",9,3,12,19 February 2015
Green Book," As Hollywood's official House of Horror, poignant monster dilemmas . . .
",". . . are no strangers to Universal Studios. From its silent movie days, when the unrequited loves of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA elicited many a tear from sensitive theater goers, to Frankenstein's Monster learning that little girls don't always float, to the Creature being hounded out of the cozy confines of that Black Lagoon, the lives of Universal's horror stars are a lot more difficult than those of 'Terry Howard's' HUSTLE & FLOW street entrepreneurs. And what could be harder than the predicament facing 'Doc' in GREEN BOOK? An alcoholic gay White Chopin-playing piano prodigy born with a Black body, Doc nevertheless insists upon drunkenly cruising Pale Face-only swimming pools after hours, on the prowl for short-term romantic partners. To 'up' the horror quotient, Universal depicts Doc's Happy Hunting Grounds in the U.S. Deep South at the height of America's so-called 'Jim Crow' Era. If all of this is making GET OUT seem like a church picnic in comparison, you're picking up on the vibe created by GREEN BOOK, our top Horror Flick of 2018.",10,3,7,13 December 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," This flick provides the perfect playbook for these troubled times . . .
",". . . though on its surface JOHN WICK: CHAPTER TWO may appear to be merely a mind-numbing exercise in murderous mayhem. Such a facile dismissal of Keanu Reeve's cautionary tale ignores the tenor of Today. This afternoon one of Massachusetts' U.S. Congressmen was tossing around the words 'High Treason' on CNN while discussing how rogue U.S. Army Gen. Michael Flynn, Sr. was White House Resident Rump's Mafioso go-between in selling out America to Rump's Red Commie KGB loan shark Vlad 'The Mad Russian' Putin even before the Rigged Election of 2016 occurred. Since that day, of course, we've all seen the Basket of Deplorable Putin cabinet picks--confirmed with ONLY the votes of the Putin Party Senators--including the KKK's Jeff Sessions as Putin's Attorney General; Putin's buddy Rex 'Exxon Valdez' Tillerson as Putin's Secretary of State; Betsy 'Amway Calling' Pyramid-Scheming DeVos as U.S. Secretary of Miseducation to run Putin's chain of for-profit brain-washing shacks; Tom-the-Inside-Trader Price for the HHS head of extermination camps to deal with all the Americans cut loose by Putin from ObamaCare, Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, and Medicare--the list seems endless. That's why Wick is leading the way in showing how to fight against Traitorous Putin Party Members: with Extreme Prejudice. As YOU plan to do your Patriotic Bit in defending America, notice that Wick ends virtually EVERY confrontation with a head-shot (even the buxom nude chick in the big bathtub). Not all of us will be lucky enough to take down the Ace of Spades or the Queen of Hearts in Putin's stacked deck. Most of us might not even have access to someone ranking as high as the two of clubs. But if YOUR neighbor funded Putin by purchasing one of those cynical 'Make America Great Again' hats, or displayed one of those Rump\Scents yard signs last fall, go after them--John Wick style. After all, what do you have left to lose?",6,3,14,14 February 2017
Minions," 'Roger, go at throttle up . . . '
",". . . seems to be the end of Kevin, as the MINIONS animators painstakingly recreate one of the most iconic images of the late 20th Century: the twisted mess of contrails splayed across the blue sky after the Jan. 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger explosion. In Real Life, this disaster blew up Christa McAuliffe--the first Teacher in Space--and six others, but in the Animated Universe, Giganticized Minion Kevin not only survives HIS version of the Challenger Explosion, but is inexplicably reduced back to his proper (if diminutive) size. Not only are the contrails of the Challenger Disaster faithfully reproduced here, but also the pregnant pause among the crowd of equally horrified on-lookers desperately hoping it's all a bad dream for Kevin (as the Challenger viewers had once prayed). Since this flick comes from that premier House of Horror, Universal Studios, it would be disingenuous to criticize them for spoofing the Challenger Tragedy for their big cartoon climax. No doubt they'll wait another five or ten years to make an animated reference to the Twin Towers collapsing on 9-11.",7,6,11,12 July 2015
Spectre," James Bond retires as the 'Pale King' . . .
",". . . just as 'Gentleman Jim' Corbett faded from the scene as the final major 'Great White Hope' on the heavyweight boxing scene in the early 1900s. Folks such as the next (currently unknown) Will Smith or Denzel Washington have been telegraphed to be in line to fill the shoes of the Connery's, Moore's, Dalton's, Brosnan's, and Craig's of the past. Giving the Agent 007 series a darker tone from here on out undoubtedly will unleash a misfire or two, such as a Morris Chestnut or a Steve Harvey-type incarnated as 'Bond. James Bond.' But neither of them would be as cringe-worthy as George Lazenby (Eon Company's James II). The second sure thing is that the next Bond will be a Yank. SPECTRE puts the handwriting on the wall in that regard by imploding the hulking MI6 headquarters building (which already was reduced to an obsolete ruin by the end of Eon Bond #23, SKYFALL). Since Britain has been relegated to the status of being a virtual museum island of little 21st Century relevance in Real Life, Eon must transplant its next, Black Bond to America (a move long overdue). When 007's behind the wheel of a 'Vette or Mustang, he'll be primed for his Next Generation.",9,7,22,7 November 2015
Joy," Get in line for social security, Julia Roberts & Sandra Bullock . . .
",". . . with JOY, Jennifer Lawrence has finished entrenching herself as America's latest Sweetheart. After scraping by in WINTER'S BONE, dancing through SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, and doing the AMER!CAN HUSTLE, Jenny may not have become Queen of Panem as THE HUNGER GAMES wrapped up its famine, but JOY brings her to an even more exalted pinnacle: Empress of American Home Shopping. Though Ms. Lawrence has a turn with a pump-action shot gun at her neighborhood shooting venue here, she is not allowed to erase the family members and callous frauds obstructing her Progress, because this Docudrama recreates Real Life events that involve Actual People. The lesson JOY brings this Holiday Season for other would-be American Inventors and Small Business People is NOT to expect anything other than bankruptcy UNLESS you have loads of firepower (OR you're on really great terms with a sibling or spouse who is also a patent lawyer). Otherwise, JOY suggests, having an American Dream just leaves you open for heartbreak (and you'll be much better off hiding in your bedroom watching TV like JOY's mom!).",8,2,7,2 January 2016
The Nice Guys," Warner Bros. films usually warn America about upcoming catastrophes . . .
",". . . long BEFORE the fact, not decades AFTER the shark's been jumped. However, at first glance THE NICE GUYS seems to be chewing cud already masticated in the 1900s, as alcoholic drug-addled Califorians plot to eliminate the U.S. Middle Class by replacing the Classic Cars of Detroit (such as Mustangs, Corvettes, Continentals, Caddies, GTO's, and Chargers) with an Invasion of Axis Imports from America's Revenge-Minded Enemies of World War Two, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. As each Trojan Horsepower takes a hundred bucks out of a True Blue American's pocket (or $20,000 plus per vehicle), THE NICE GUYS documents how civil order breaks down, with everyone at risk of Death by Random Gunshot, as bodies rain down from the rooftops (unless they're burned up in arson fires or Smushed by killer foreign cars first). Ryan Gosling's character drives a German Mercedes here. The script for THE NICE GUYS is sprinkled with references to Hitler, since Adolph is having the 'last laugh' now. Perhaps Warner's warning is that if you think things have been bad the last 50 years, just wait and see how much WORSE things will get with a One Per Center Secretive Billionaire representing the Trilaterals in the White House!",8,1,5,31 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," MAD MAX: FURY ROAD defines the movie genre called 'eye candy' . . .
",". . . as its events take place in an alternate reality located on an unnamed planet in an island of time unconnected to any we know. This Parallel Universe seems to have a few things in common with Life As We Know It, such as men, women, and gasoline-powered vehicles. But the Laws of Physics discovered by people such as Newton and Einstein do not apply here. Nor do the Economic Principles of Malthus, or any precepts of the Natural Sciences as taught in America's public schools. (Maybe they dove-tail somewhat with Creationism and Global Warming Deniers--I wouldn't know about that.) In MAD MAX, children are only seen in nightmares, but non-pregnant women are 'milked' by machines for so many gallons that milk baths are the preferred way to clean up. This planet's gravity is such that 100-ton trucks seem to get about 500 miles per gallon of gas. Though the landscape has less vegetation than any desert on Earth, the common folks appear to be well-fed (but are told they do NOT need any water to survive.) For entertainment, artificial waterfalls are allowed to soak into the parched landscape at the drop of a hat. The original MAD MAX trilogy made some attempt to maintain an internal logic connected to our world. This remake simply tries hard to be over the top, all the time. Some people fancy themselves to be visually oriented--this film is for them. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is 'Beyond the Thinkingdome' for everyone else.",8,2,7,20 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson has John Wayne somersaulting in his grave . . .
",". . . with his latest flick, HACKSAW RIDGE, which can be best described as APOCALYPTO on steroids. Draft dodger Wayne's 'Sgt. Stryker' character definitely would have killed the mutinous vegetarian Bible Thumper Desmond Doss in boot camp. Fortunately for America, in Real Life Wayne's wide yellow streak prevented his Unconstitutional Fascist Ideals from directly contaminating Our Real Heroes, such as the pacifist Doss. Without making a fist, let alone firing a shot or throwing a grenade, Doss broke the spirit of Japan's Suicide Squad on Okinawa by combating the Japanese Death Eater Culture with America's Vibrant Life Spirit. Director Gibson makes the case with HACKSAW that the current Millennial Generation is unlikely to produce enough stalwarts like Doss to win the next World War. Therefore, by picturing nearly naked Japanese soldiers using the White Flag of Surrender to launch a grenade attack against the Americans AFTER targeting U.S. medics and savagely executing dozens of helpless U.S. wounded guys, Gibson is implicitly endorsing Leader Trump's Plan to nuke Syria, Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, and, probably, Japan again for good measure. This will allow Fortess America to get rid of our aging H-Bomb inventory in order to make room for Trump's new generation of Peace-Making Bombs. Tuesday you can put America's Future in the hands of Crooked Hillary's Legion of Brave Vegetarians (IF ANY!), or keep our soldiers' hands clean with Leader Trump's Nuclear Rocketeers.",10,10,20,5 November 2016
Warcraft," How much Validity is there in comparing WARCRAFT . . .
",". . . to our current Real Life World Geopolitical Scene? 'Two worlds. One home.' is among the tag-lines promoting WARCRAFT. Many of my friends, particularly the military ones, equate WARCRAFT's Orcs with Jihadis when they play or discuss WARCRAFT. They point out that the Orcs amputate limbs in punishment for infractions, just as happens daily in the Jihadi third of the Real World. Orc factions constantly are in armed conflict with one another. Sound familiar? Of course it does, at least to them. The Orc clans share a love for Stone Age rituals, and the destruction of any bulwarks of more advanced Civilizations, just as the Jihadis razed Palmyra, Ninevah, and blew up the planet's largest statues and other World Wonders (not to mention the Pride of Japanese Architecture, New York City's World Trade Center). Orc warfare is often one-sided hands-on terror waged against comparatively defenseless humans, just as Jihadis are most infamous for beheading bound captives. It seems that WARCRAFT may well be plagiarized from Today's Headlines.",8,3,5,14 June 2016
Me Before You," Literally half an hour prior to us seeing ME BEFORE YOU . . .
",". . . we were delayed in the bank parking lot (so MUCH that we MISSED the first three previews!) by a young chick walking S-L-O-W-L-Y in the middle of the road in front of us (right next to a perfectly good sidewalk) yakking on her cell phone, TOTALLY oblivious to the extreme danger caused by her Solipcistic Sociopathic Behavior. (Naturally, we did not beep her with our car horn, since it was impossible to predict whether such a highly warranted caution would elicit a psychotic episode of Phone Rage on her part, perhaps involving her launching herself into our car, causing hundreds or thousands in damages by an uninsured pedestrian). Warner Bros. has released ME to warn America that maybe cell phones were fun while they lasted, but they MUST be outlawed immediately! Fortunately for us, it wasn't raining this afternoon. The motorcyclist who gets traumatized, and totals his bike in the drizzle against cell phone-toting 'Will Trayner' as ME begins was NOT so lucky! (Some women may go through a box of Kleenex during ME, but most guys will see through this flick as a case of FIFTY SHADES OF GIMP meets EYEBROWS WRITHING LIKE SNAKES).",7,0,5,9 November 2016
Macbeth," In one of the greatest plagiarism crimes in film history . . .
",". . . the Weinstein Company has churned out thousands of movie posters for MACBETH without a single mention of Bill Shakespeare in sight. Evidentally Kow-Towing to the sound and fury of the ANONYMOUS crowd, these movie-producing fat cats should have their pants sued off by Bill's heirs for copyright infringement. Not only do these MERCHANTS OF VENICE appropriate Bill's title, but the script for this flick is stolen in one fell swoop, virtually line-for-line from what Bill wrote for his Globe Theatre in London a few years back. But I suppose what's done is done. However, if you have significant cataracts, DO NOT TRY TO SEE THIS FLICK, because you won't be able to! Apparently to save on the budget required to film MACBETH on director Roman Polanski's scale, most all of this latest film of that name takes place in a murky haze which perfectly captures the heartbreak of cataracts. If you already suffer from this tragic condition, watching this MACBETH through your set of double cataracts won't be any easier that trying to perceive it from behind Niagara Falls! The Weinsteins also skimp on castles, resorting to tents for the first half of this story. Most who remember Polanski's version will be stunned to hear that there's not one naked witch in sight here, as the union scale for nude actresses was far beyond the scope of this low-budget effort. Though 99% of Bill's dialogue is mumbled incoherently here (no doubt the Weinsteins skimped on microphones, as well), we do learn that 'The Thane of Fife had a wife,' who doubtless was as burned up as anyone else over this MACBETH!",8,3,5,15 December 2015
13 Hours," America wins the Battle of Benghazi . . .
",". . . about 227 to 4, as best as I could count during 13 HOURS (which seemed to last at least that long in the theater). If this had been a Little League game, the 'Mercy Rule' would have stopped this fiasco when the score got to be around USA 20, Libya 2, but there are no baseball teams in Benghazi. However, 13 HOURS director Michael Bay is not content to just show how each American is worth 50 foreigners, but insists upon adding his own personal political spin to this story. Bay seems to be arguing that Americans should be prohibited from traveling outside our U.S. borders. We've already forbidden trips to Cuba for decades, and our fellow U.N. member North Korea currently has put the dangerous Outside World off-limits to its own citizens. Bay is urging us with 13 HOURS to end taxpayer funding of the C.I.A., as well as calling for the closing of all U.S. Embassies and foreign military bases. He is showing us that it would have been far cheaper, far more effective, and far more practical (as well as saving thousands of American lives and trillions of taxpayer dollars) if we'd simply nuked Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan when the governments of these two rogue nations allowed 19 Saudi hijackers directed by a Saudi holed up in Afghanistan to ruin Normal Life in America on Sept. 11, 2001 (footage of which begins his movie). Maybe Bay has a point, seeing as how we've spent billions on nukes these past 71 years with nothing to show for it.",8,2,13,21 January 2016
Sully," Director Clint Eastwood and Warner Bros. are Warning America . . .
",". . . that we MUST elect someone such as Leader Trump in November to revamp our Education and Transportation Systems. In his masterful, ROSHOMON-like hit movie SULLY, Eastwood examines the title character from every angle. Though Trump University's B.S. in Aviation REQUIRES would-be airline pilots to study John Wayne's example in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, as well as Leslie Nielsen's character in AIRPLANE!, Eastwood portrays a Chesley Sullenberger who jogs around in front of taxis, whiles away the hours at bars, and NEVER sees a flick! Wayne's 'Whistling Dan' co-pilot has to slap around his boss Robert Stack to prevent a mid-flight water ditching when Stack goes all SULLY on him (in a scene which is later famously reprised--18 times--in AIRPLANE!). But since Chesley skips Trump U., he and his culturally illiterate cohorts have no one to slap THEM around! The only silver lining is that just a trashy Airbus is lost by SULLY. Leader Trump has pledged to outlaw this sort of cheap foreign vehicle, unable to withstand encounters with rugged American Wild Life. So come next Jan. 20, it will be good riddance to Toyota, Mercedes, and Airbus!",10,3,11,13 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," '20th Century Fox' (that is, Fox from the Racist 1900s) . . .
",". . . brazenly Allegorizes its own monstrous Creation, Don Juan Rump, in ALIEN COVENANT. Michael Fassbender is cast as the Demonic David, Hell-Bent upon destroying Human Kind, and he has Rump down to a Tee. Pretending to be a Friend of the Common Man, this 'synthetic' Humanoid--David--turns out to be a Destroyer of Planets. Many commentators have classed Rump with HOWARD THE DUCK and the star of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE as an unworldly creature not of our Beloved Mother Earth. Just as the Good Ships Prometheus and Covenant were created to feed David's Nefarious Passion Play, Fox 'News' birthed Rump to end Human Civilization as We Have Known It. ALIEN COVENANT gloats over the fact that resistance to David OR Rump is totally futile. You could smelt down either one of them in a vat of molten metal like Boris Karloff as FRANKENSTEIN or Arnold Schwarzenegger as TERMINATOR, but they'd each disappear with smirks on their faces in the knowledge that they have curtailed the possibility for World Peace of Mind from Now until Eternity.",8,2,12,22 May 2017
The Wizard of Oz," This flick beats CITIZEN KANE 'Heads over Munchkins' for the title of . . .
",". . . 'Best Movie of All Time.' Only very insecure cinema reviewers and 'film school' professors (that is, those dudes who think that they--and they alone--are on the verge of 'understanding' CITIZEN KANE) could rate the disjointed Orwellian newsreel above 'Dorothy Gale's' epic journey to Emerald City. One of these flicks features a Yellow Brick Road; the other, a rotten sled. One film is dominated by the Wicked Witch of the West; the other, by a drunken hag. Aging, alcoholic, gold-digging showgirls are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, but WHO ELSE could curdle your blood by demanding to know 'WHO killed my sister?' Or by threatening 'I'm going to get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!' 'Charles Foster Kane' may have become 'unstuck in time,' but his hop-scotching through the years can't hold a candle to 'Billy Pilgrim's' anachronistic adventures during SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. (Don't even TRY to picture Mr. Welles caged--in the buff--as he's ogled by alien zoo-goers, along with a similarly unclad Double D Lady!) CITIZEN KANE lacks even ONE chart-topping hit song. (Can you imagine how much better it COULD have been if it had opened to the strains of 'Ding dong, old Chuck is dead!'?) Though both KANE and OZ are met to be scathing critiques of American monetary policies as of 120 years ago, when KANE's sledding gets tough, it breaks a snow globe. OZ, on the other hand, keeps its eye on the crystal ball, never losing sight of the fact that the Yellow (Gold) Brick Road is a Dead End Street. Kane pulls most of its punches, devolving into the bathos of maudlin sentimentality. Conversely, OZ promises us that heroes can lead a Popular Uprising against the Established Order, 'liquidating' the Fat Cat One Per Centers who think that THEY can Lord it over We True Blue Loyal Patriotic Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Working Stiff Citizens forever!",10,1,2,11 March 2019
Furious 7," As anyone keeping up with Nascar's Brad Keselowski knows . . .
",". . . the fastest drivers make the best fighters, too. In Real Life, a former Nascar racer recently was sentenced for fleeing police across three states at a speed of 150 mph. Add to that Keselowski's 'Bum of the Month Club' bouts climaxing many of his 2014 Sunday afternoon jaunts, and the plot for FURIOUS 7 practically writes itself. If Kevin Harvick shot out a 100th Floor window of some Abu Dhabi high-rise, you can bet Keselowski would shoot out right on his tail from the 101st Floor. Since nearly every Nascar event is conducted in an Open Carry state, it's only a matter of time before the Daytona 500 and most of the lesser-known contests inject a literal element of 'road rage' into their proceedings by encouraging drivers to become Armed & Dangerous. Other than adding some bullet-proof glass atop the walls for young spectator protection, America's fastest sport seems ready-made for FURIOIUS 8 pay-per-view-style mayhem. After all, that saw about 'We went to see Nascar, and an MMA brawl broke out' could seem old (if not tame) very soon.",9,3,8,11 April 2015
