"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Tack-a-rama!
","I embarked on a journey through the beautiful outback of Australia with three guys who are searching for an answer. They are three drag queens. The best in Sydney, who want to spend the next four weeks traveling to this casino to perform their performance of a life time. There is Adam Whitely, also known as Felicia Jollygoodfellow (Guy Pearce). He is the 'classic' drag queen. Constantly looking for a good time. Very comfortable in his lifestyle, and always looking for a chance to be in the spotlight. Pearce adds most of the comedy to the trip and perhaps some of the best costumes that these 'ladies' have to wear. There is also Anthony 'Tick' Belrose (Hugo Weaving), also known as Mitzi Del Bra. He is the secretive drag queen. We learn that he is married, he has a child, and that he is afraid of his profession. Quite possibly the best performer in the group, he provides a sense of leadership to the group. He is the one that organized this trip, and the one who's wife works at the casino, and set up this gig for them. Finally, there is the elder of the group. The experienced drag queen, Ralph, also known as Bernadette Bassenger. He is almost like the Yoda of the group. Shouting out lessons that need to be learned, he plays the complete opposite to Pearce's character. After buying a bus it to travel through the outback, they christen it 'Priscilla'. After a few road bumps such as stops in other locations, a Chinese ping-pong lady, a group of violent mates, and even love. As they make it to the casino, our group hits their final snag as they struggle for acceptance in an unchanged world.This was a horrible film. Not just horrible, but also confusing, plot less, motionless, and uneventful. Yes, I realize many of those words mean the same, but they all happened in this film. My first problem was that I had trouble trying to see who the 'stand-out' character was. Normally in films, you have that one character that has more screen time, more sub-stories, more character development. While I first thought that it was going to be Weaving's character, during the bus trip through the outback, I began to question my initial guess. I feel that if we wanted to have the emotional impact at the end of the film for Weaving's reuniting with his son, then perhaps we should have spend less time with Stamp as we traveled. I felt that midway through the film, Stamp became the central character because of his love towards Bob. If this is the case, was the director trying to create the theme of acceptance towards same sex characters, or was he trying to show the theme of acceptance of who you are and not to be afraid to be proud. I felt that these themes broke down like 'Priscilla' in the outback.Not only were the themes jumbled, but so were these characters. I realize that Stamp was nominated for some awards for this role, but I honestly felt like he, along with the rest of the cast, were just walking through some lines and blocking. During their songs, I felt that they were acting. I never once felt a connection to these characters. Colorful costumes do not make a better actor. Terence Stamp hardly smiled in what I felt was supposed to be a fun character. I need to also say this, if you are going to make a film about lip singing to songs, make sure that your actors know the lyrics. About ten times I saw them, especially Stamp, flub his lines.Finally, there was not enough development at all with Pearce's character. I felt that if anything he was just annoying. Not really contributing anything to the actual story other then the occasional joke or reference, he seemed to just float through every scene on just his physical appearance. Did he need to have his shirt off for every scene? Overall, the costumes were great...but don't make this the focus of your film. I enjoyed the beauty of the costumes in the desert...seemed to strike me as religious in some way. Dull, trite, and what seemed like bored actors brought this film directly to my DVD then right out the window. Films have moved so much further in this genre of film that I hope that we learn from its mistakes.Grade: ** out of *****",6,1,8,21 September 2004
The Longest Yard," Fumble. All I can say is fumble.
","What did I like about this film? Was there anything worth keeping with this nearly play by play remake that would make even the British version blush? Outside of the hits and the music, there was absolutely nothing. 'The Longest Yard' was the sorriest sad sack of a comedy ever to be called a film. While it tried to be identical to the first, it misses the mark mainly due to the characters, the cheap inserted jokes, and the obvious over budget. Do we need to be spending millions of dollars to make the grass greener? Before I begin, I want everyone to look at the box to this DVD  see Adam grinning  does he look tough enough, does he look like a QB, does he look like he can be hit by huge linebackers and live to tell? My answer is no, and for you hoping to see a Happy Gilmore in a football jersey, you will be sadly disappointed. This film was plastic wrap in its grandest of ways. This film is Styrofoam when you really just needed a big belly laugh to ease the day. This film was cliché after cliché with a VERY LOUD soundtrack. How could this be? Basically, this was the same film that Reynolds did a long time ago, but with Adam Sandler  shouldn't it be funnier? Alas it wasn't. How did this film fail? After watching the original film, the British 'Mean Machine', and finally this one, I came to realize that the spirit was just missing from the cast, the production, and the design. While Sandler spewed the same lines that Reynolds did during his prime, it was difficult for me to see Sandler filling into Reynolds' boots. The two actors are not the same, the age of America is different, and what originally was a creative film about self-discovery, turned into an over-budgeted film about trying to make the audience see those amazing hits that can be seen on ESPN. Director Peter Segal has nobody to blame but himself. 'The Longest Yard' is one of those films that couldn't be remade today because the surrounding themes are obsolete. The bulk of this issue falls on the casting. I have already denounced Sandler, but Chris Rock is the icing on the cake. He is absolutely not Caretaker. He was not the smart, Jiminy Cricket-esquire character that Crewe needed to see what was important to him in the long run. When it comes to the quintessential pinch moment, there is no emotion  I literally didn't care what happened between the two. They tried to be funny together with words, but the humor in the original fell in the situation, not Rock lounging around like this was his obvious first day at prison. The rest of the story, with the miscast of these two, fell completely to the ground. Sandler's cronies are there, Schnieder humiliating himself again, but Cromwell made me twitch again. Where was his evil, his motive, his sinister tenacity? Again, due to a much bigger budget, bigger stars, and a decision to make the punches bigger than the story, Segal let this film slip right out of his hands and into a failed category.Nothing worked in this film  at least I didn't think anything did until I finished the film and found myself humming a few bars from the music. The music was way TOO LOUD  it distracted (like so many other elements of this remake) from the essential story lines, but it was perfect music for this film. They strengthened the hits, made us feel like we were on the field with the team, and inspired us to root for the good guys  but the music alone doesn't create an amazing film (unless it is a musical  but I digress). 'The Longest Yard' suffered because of its poor character development, its poor casting decision, the painful story, and the insufferable direction. Yet, the music remained a constant focus. Thank you music team  it is the only one that I am handing out for this review.Overall, I hated this film. It disgraced the original and I don't even find myself a fan of sports films. If I had to rank these three films (the original, the remake, and the British) it would be a tight race between Vinnie Jones and young Reynolds  I thought that the Brits seemed to have a better grasp on what this film was trying to accomplish more than Segal did. Sandler was a joke, Rock sunk to the bottom, and it was obvious that Reynolds was just in it for the nostalgic effect. While the cameos by the ex-jocks would make any enthusiast drool, they try their best to hold up any remaining value to this film. It took me two views to make it through this, while I can nearly recite all of the lines from 'Happy Gilmore' or 'Billy Madison'. That should be the perfect example of what horrid road Sandler has been traveling. I would strongly suggest skipping this film. Watch the original or import, but seem to know better what comedy is all about than Mr. Segal.Grade: * out of *****",3,6,12,27 October 2007
50 First Dates," You're the state idiot of Hawaii.
","I don't know what happened. The critics are raving about this film because it 'shows Sandler's humble and sensitive side', but I am raving because we saw this side of him. Where was his Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison days? Have they long gone? I at least thought that it would be better or as good as The Wedding Singer, but alas, that dream didn't come true either. The moment we walked out of the theater after seeing this, my wife referenced it to a bowl of oatmeal. The lumpiness of it reminded her of this film.50 First Dates just didn't make any sense. There were loopholes like crazy that our audience just didn't see because they were laughing at the walrus throwing up scene. There were scenes that were not finished, and there were actors that just didn't care that they were in the film. It is bad when people who have seen this film are talking more about Sean Astin and Rob Schneider more than Sandler or Barrymore. Astin, oddly enough, wore the same outfit in this film as his 'brother' did in the Goonies movie. Coincidence? No, I saw this as yet another marketing ploy to make people think that there was something funny going on when there actually wasn't. Drew was off in this film. She just seemed like she was overacting, while it seemed like Sandler just wasn't himself. I guess that is what happens when Happy Madison productions and Flower Films team up to do a movie ... wait ... don't they both own those production companies? Cheap people. What was Dan Aykroyd doing in this film? There was a line that he said that just didn't seem to fit anywhere in the movie at all. He wasn't funny. Also, he was trying (or perhaps it was the director, but Aykroyd was in on it too) to milk every last drop from Tommy Boy. Something about Callahan motors paying for the doctor's office. I don't know, by that time I was ready to pass out from the boredom.There was only one redeeming scene in this film, and that was close to the end. I am not even going to talk about it, because just like Barrymore in this film, I am hoping that I wake up tomorrow and I don't remember this at all. People just need to be educated. What gets me about this film is that if you watched the film, you would understand that the song that Barrymore sang, the pivotal song of the film ... the song that takes Sandler back to her ... was not sung because she remembered him, but because she remembered her parents. WAS NOBODY PAYING ATTENTION??? Arg. Where was Kevin McDonald? Where was Steve Buscemi? Where was the fun? Missing from this film.The only compliment that I will pay this film is that it did make me want to go back to Maui. The background was beautiful. That is what the whole state is like. Too bad this film couldn't have been the same. Unless Sandler goes back to a serious director, I will definitely think twice about giving my money back to him. I sometimes wish that I could place his face on a milk carton and send it out ... send the message that we miss the old Sandler, and hope that he gets the message.A man can dream ... can't he?

Raiders of the Lost Ark," Do you think Illinois Nazis wanted the Ark as well?
","As a child of the 80s, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was the epitome of movie making. Two big directors, a huge star, Nazis, the unknown, a spooky finale, action, adventure, humor, far away lands – this movie, this one singular film had it all. This film had something for everyone; man, woman, and child could all sit around and be amazed by Indy's adventure. Everything about this film is addicting. Watching it then, and even today – Indiana Jones' theme music stuck with me for hours afterwards. This film is more than just a casual view; it is a part of history in the making. The cult icon that Spielberg and Lucas created breathed a celebrity life into the world of archaeology, but also has handed the world a character that felt real and exciting. With that said, re-watching this staple of my youth today, in 2009, it became a far different cinematic experience. 'Raiders' is an important film, it is still an amazing film to watch, it is still two hours of entertaining adventure, but does the DVD do it justice? Is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' only really meant to be enjoyed on VHS? These questions arise from crisper images shouting through my player at night, the lack of detail around the edges (don't be ashamed of the VHS fuzz), and how bright this dusty hero should have looked. I am not judging quality here, but Indy will always remain a VHS protagonist in my book.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' as a stand-alone film works better than anything that could be released today. It takes the adventurous introduction of a man in search of a gold statue and juxtaposes it with an image of Indy as a teacher. It is a film that even after numerous viewings, the deadpan humor of Harrison Ford remains funny and repeatable in a group of friends. This, unlike 'Crystal Skull' relies on Indiana's skills, it takes us to places that actually could exist, and builds a mythology that is real. We were not overwhelmed with CGI or great effects, these were the days of stuntmen and real explosions – this was made during a time where realism took precedence over computer. Yet, isn't that the mantra of Indiana? Isn't the idea of this film to inspire youthful minds to become archaeologists, to make them aware that modern technology could take a backseat to a fedora and/or whip any day? There is this classic nature of both this character, but of the way Ford portrays him. Ford gives us this hero that is literally an everyman – he bleeds, he has fears, he punches when he should run – these are all great relatable features that still makes Ford's Indiana Jones so iconic. The costume works, but it is the level of strength that Ford brings that makes me replay my VHS over and over.What else makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' perfect? The Nazi element, the idea that Hitler was searching for more than just total world domination was brilliant. Lucas and Spielberg took a trusted villain, a villain from the classic radio era, and made him search all over the world for this Ark of the Covenant. The spiritual element within this film is not overbearing, mostly explained, and it again gives us a task that may not be too out of reach for the average viewer. Watching it today, older, wiser, and somewhat more film skilled, I loved learning that Karen Allen could drink like it was her job. I never did catch the romantic twist forming between Belloq and Allen, but it seemed more relevant as I am older. Our man Dietrich was both hysterical and utterly evil; one of my favorite scenes was when he tricks us into hanging his coat. Brilliant. Proving again that 'Raiders' takes you on this journey, a journey that could have been stale and caper-ish, and delivers a story that seems bold, refreshing, and new each time that you watch it – no matter what age you are.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a timeless film. I cannot wait to watch it again – every element from the design, to the characters, to the finale is perfect. Despite the passion that I have for the VHS version, the DVD does thankfully make this film more accessible to the modern masses. This was created during the time where Ford was making skilled movies, a trait that he seems to have forgotten today. Do not watch this series backward, do not begin with 'Crystal Skull' and expect 'Raiders' to be the same. It is a retro film, a film about using skills sans computers. It is near perfection from everyone filming, writing, and acting within it. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for creativity, excitement, and/or a time where cinema was fun.I miss these days.Grade: ***** out of *****",8,1,2,14 July 2009
The Birth of a Nation," Our Nation's History with Music...
","'Birth of a Nation' can rattle any viewer to the core because of both the brazen images that it conjures, but also, made in 1915, it forces the viewer to change the way they watch movies. There are no spoken words, just the loud notes of the orchestra playing 'Dixie', or 'Star Spangled Banner', or just tunes to carry us to the next scene. This film also depicts the racial tensions of the time rather honestly. Griffith has been marked a racist for his work on this film, the images of white actors playing African Americans, or the depiction of the power of the Klu Klux Klan can rattle any viewer to the core. Isn't that the point? 'Birth of a Nation' is not only a stronger, more influential film than 'Gone With the Wind', but it challenges the typical popcorn-to-couch viewer. One could show similarities between the two films by saying that there are sweeping landscapes and powerful battle scenes in both films, but Griffith takes it a step further by showing us the history of racism, a.k.a. the birth of a fearing nation. He begins with the Civil War, most specifically two families that were friends prior to the War, but find themselves eventually on dueling sides of the battlefield. It is this brother-against-brother war that fuels the future events of the South. Griffith's film also develops the power of Abe Lincoln throughout these times. It shows his compassion, his desire to unify the country, and to assist in the redevelopment of the South. This, sadly, gives a further reason as to why his assassination took place, and how the North used this to push the South into further disarray.To modern standards, 'Birth of a Nation' is racist. Griffith's depiction of African Americans in the army, voting, and taking office is very difficult to watch in 2008, but there is a moment of truth to his images. The new rule from the North brought too much power to one particular person, thus destroying any level of equality for this already war-ravished nation. In the same vein, Griffith's portrayal of the KKK to today's modern standards is also considered racist. To have an organization, fueled by hatred, be the heroines of the film, is again, difficult to watch in 2008  but Griffith, I believe, sees this and with that final scene of the KKK demonstrates how they have transformed into an entity of hatred, instead of encouraged by change. Griffith credits the birth of the KKK as a group that merely wanted to have a voice in the South, a group that wanted to have equality across the board, so in retaliation, they organized, and the KKK was formed. Having never read 'The Clansmen', one does question how detailed Griffith went when pulling source material for his film from this book. Watching how the KKK regains power is necessary to this story, because Griffith is able to take these historically accurate moments and show us where we went wrong. 'Birth of a Nation' is a film that points the finger inward, depicting casualties from both the North and South, both white and black, and both rich and poor. The underlining meaning to 'Birth of a Nation' is that corruption and evil lurk from all different places and that perhaps the best response isn't the greatest action.Finally, I would like to end this review by expressing my feelings toward this film. This was an emotional, exhausting, and powerful film to watch. Why it isn't on everyone's 'Top Ten' lists is beyond me, outside of the fact that perhaps the depiction of the KKK or African Americans is a bit hard to swallow. I would agree that this film is racist, but in the context of the time, I think Griffith was right to do what he did to create this masterpiece. I am not racist myself, but if I had a child, and wanted to show them a darker side to our great nation, this would be the film I would showcase. Not only does it show racism, but is shows 'why'. It is a courageous film from its historical basis, but a sad film from its honesty. Everyone should watch 'Birth of a Nation', it is a bold entry into not just the world of cinema (the first real epic), but it is one of the few films to really paint a dirty picture of the Civil War. While we all agree that the Civil War (or any war) is unjust, 'Birth of a Nation' takes us to next level to show its repercussions.Overall, I initially had trouble training my eyes to watch a non-talking film. The music was fantastic, the scenes were detailed, and the story captured my attention until the very end. This was a historical epic  surprisingly, an epic that takes you away from you comfort zone. It forces you to root for an evil organization, to shake your head at the images of African Americans, and see the corruption of the North (a side we typically see as sympathetic to the cause). My argument is that this film is a classic  alas, a forgotten classic. While film schools, film geeks, and non-commercial film literature feels that 'Birth of a Nation' is considered the ultimate classic, there is a strong majority that fear the message in this film  that fear the images that Griffith has created  thus they push away, and on so many lists of films you will find 'Gone With the Wind', a glossier, less engaging film. In conclusion, 'Birth of a Nation' is exactly what the title describes. It is the birth of our current society, complete with racism, hatred, confusion, corruption, epic battles, and greed. It is a film that should be catapulted to the top, not forgotten at the bottom.Grade: ***** out of *****",8,1,5,25 August 2008
Lords of Dogtown," Lords of something, but perhaps not Dogtown
","Hardwicke, whom many of you remember as the brain child behind the fabulously gritty drama 'thirteen', helms this project with the same gumption that she enlisted for her prior film. Using some of the same crew, same filming technique, and an over-hyped budget this film demonstrates that even the dirtiest of teen struggles can be glossed over to Hollywood standards. Egos aside, we are handed a Hardwicke special which includes (but is not limited to) shirtless tween hunks, a sense of invincibility over adults, a rockin' good soundtrack, a time frame that breaks all borders, and finally two actual stars that would be used to introduce an older audience that may not be familiar with teen main characters to pack theaters and make sure someone's child gets a college tuition. I am harsh with this film  again, why?  because this was supposed to be a group that was anti-establishment, anti-normality, anti-boundaries, yet seemed to fit well within this Hollywood box. I witnessed the innovators of a generation, sans Jay Adams, sell their souls for corporate glory. Sure, they may have wanted their story to be told for a new generation of skaters, but there could have been a better way to portray this creativity, struggle, and eventual breakdown of friendships. This was supposed to be like the grittier 'Stand by Me', when instead it felt like Disney was an independent benefactor.I thought Hardwicke's choice of cinematography, camera angle, and story placement seemed dated. She did this already in 'thirteen', I wanted her to explore more boundaries, stronger moments, and really define herself as a director. Instead, I watched three times (two audio commentaries plague this disc) a director mimic their already golden film  even the choice of casting some of the same actors from 'thirteen'. After watching 'Dogtown and Z-Boys', I was prepared to see a better side to their story. I wanted Hardwicke to take me places that Peralta's minimal budget couldn't. With Peralta writing the story, I didn't think he would allow anything to slip by. I was wrong. His choice to create small, more insignificant characters to help build credibility in our central three characters was pathetic. I wanted Peralta to interact with everyone from the Zephyr skate team, not just Jay, Tony, and himself. This was a collaborative effort from everyone, and not giving everyone their moment in the spotlight just seemed to make me grumpy. I loved hearing everyone's voice during the 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' film, and it hurt to just be focused on three while others were equally as successful. If this were the case, we should have had only one story  instead of trying to intermingle everything together. Stories were dropped, players were disrespected, and the true story became a muddled mess of semi-truth and Hollywood truth. Our actors did what they could, but were shaky as the main characters. John Robinson felt like he was back filming 'Elephant 2', I just couldn't see him as any other character. Emile Hirsch was goofy, while I realized that Jay Adams was crazy (as we all know someone from our past like him), he just came off as arrogant and acting like he was a tormented teen. His scene on the burned pier with Heath was laughable at best. Victor, as Tony Alva, didn't carry the weight he was supposed to. He wasn't the best of the group, but he was the strongest, but Victor couldn't put any strength behind him. The three players did a decent job, but it was obvious from the opening scene that they weren't going to win awards for their portrayals.I must compliment Hardwicke for her choice of Heath Ledger as Skip. From the documentary to the silver screen, Ledger did an amazing job of bringing this pivotal character to life. His voice, his mannerisms, his taut demeanor was exactly like watching the documentary. I loved it. It gave me faith that Heath could pull off The Joker in the upcoming 'Batman' film. Alas, I cannot say the same for Rebecca De Mornay (who needs to do some independent work to get back into the business) and Johnny Knoxville. He is growing into an actor, but this was not the right character for him to tackle. Tony's financier needed to be meaner, pushier, and darker  none of which came from funnyman Knoxville. Everyone else involved seemed to hit their stride, as I enjoyed seeing some of my favorites playing cameo roles throughout the film. I must give credit to Hardwicke here as well for really bringing some (not all) of these guys into the project  I just wish she would have listened to them more when developing her style. She should have at least used all of them in the commentary, by just using Peralta and Alva, we knew who her favorites were. Where was Skip's side of the story? Overall, I cannot say that this film compares in anyway, shape, or form to the documentary that Peralta created. I know that he wrote this film too, but it was obvious that one was written with the soul and the other was developed for the money. 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' spoke for itself, giving us a raw taste of what life was like back in the 70s on Venice Beach and in innovation that the surfers had for bringing a new style of sport into the limelight. I loved the music again, 'Maggie May' near the end really struck a chord for me and developed Skip into this true player. I cannot suggest this film to friends because I will be devoting my time to suggesting the more impassioned 'Dogtown and Z-Boys'  especially the audio commentary  to them. I say watch the documentary, unless you like your stories with glossier endings.Grade: ** ½ out of *****",4,7,16,16 August 2007
Shaun of the Dead," It's been a funny sort of day,hasn't it?
","It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film. Normally, when this happens we end up with something like the Chucky series. It began serious, but after seeing the new preview, I know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror. I was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction, but then I remembered Â… this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny. As I was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end, I couldn't help but wonder why America has not been able to master this style of film yet. Why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes? While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based. 'If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes' style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.With its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity. It takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act. That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film. I was there, sitting in the theater, knowing that it was a zombie film (still, can I call it that?), and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background. My eyes were focused directly on our star and scene-stealer duo, Shaun and Ed. One of my favorite scenes of this film is when Shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around. How many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anything-different happening in our daily routine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions. I couldn't stop laughing.What also made this film work on every level was the cast. Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters. They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy. He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film. That is another great aspect of this film. It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment. So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds. This wasn't happening in this film. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, so I couldn't play favorites. All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.I would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film. It is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up. I know that sounds strange, but you will get used to it American viewers. I mention that it is still a zombie film because I do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof. While it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films, this film stands on its own two feet. It had blood, it has violence, and it has those infamous scenes of people's heads being blown apart. That is why we see zombie films. Overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you. I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.Grade: ***** out of *****",Null,0,1,26 September 2004
The English Patient," Good God, man, pull yourself together.
","Yet again another example of a year when a small independent film should have taken home the golden statue known as Oscar, but instead a bigger budgeted independent film (if you can call it that at all) swept it all. This film was none other than The English Patient. I know this was actually an independent film, but it surely didn't look like one when I went to go see it in the theater. Big sound, big big budget, and beautiful (expensive) scenery, leaves only the actors to be the 'independent' of the entire scenario. Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Juliette Binoche, and Willem Dafoe round out this seemingly independent production. Minghella pulls out no stops as he takes us on a whirlwind tour of  World War II? Love is a power theme as the human spirit is explored through eating peaches and talking about the 'one that got away'. While this was enjoyable the first time I watched it, I do not thing I could force myself through another viewing. It was interesting, but not provocative. It was enjoyable, but not powerful. It was emotional, but not gut-wrenching. In essence, it was lacking the 'umph' to get to the next level. I really think this could have been a decent film, but sadly, Hollywood caught it way too soon!Grade: ** out of *****",Null,2,5,25 September 2004
The Notebook," This movie brought to you by big business Kleenex!
","I am of the utmost belief that Kleenex was a sponsor of this film. It has been a very long time since Hollywood released a 'true' tearjerker film, and I know that Kleenex couldn't help but try to get a piece of the action. I know that my wife went through at least ten Kleenex by the time this film was over and she had read the book. Imagine what it would be like for those that didn't see this film coming. I honestly feel they could go through a whole box. Ironically, and corporately minded, I went through no Kleenex as I watched this film, but instead found my mind wandering and trying at any opportunity to search for any chemistry between our lovebird characters. From Garner and Rowlands to Gosling and McAdams, there was this sensation that they were nothing more than actors playing their part instead of the feeling of true love erupting from the screen. Adding to this mess was a mixed bag of story lines that seemed as if Cassavetes was trying to make straight lines out of circles. While this wasn't a horrible film by any means, The Notebook was perfect and its flaws cut very deep into this sad story.While I think Sparks' characters in his book are probably much better than in this story, I still wish he would have pushed harder for better actors or a bit more story. There definitely seemed to be a lacking on both of these ends that hurt the overall feel of the film. James Garner is old, and that was about the only thing that he had going for him. Rowlands I can give some credit towards, but strangely I couldn't see these two working together. Garner's passion towards Rowlands seems scripted, while there definitely wasn't anything between Rowlands and Garner. It felt as if Garner was working too hard while Rowlands just didn't place any effort. The Kleenex effect only occurred between these two characters, in my opinion, because they were old, and that seems to strike a chord with all of us. Perhaps it is the grandparent effect or the fear of getting to that point in our lives, I felt that tears were shed near the end of the film because of their age, not their acting ability. The same can be said for McAdams and Gosling. McAdams did a decent job with the material given, but the slipping accent of Ryan Gosling was inexcusable and disturbing. Gosling was completely miscast in this film. I don't know if he was Cassavetes first choice for the role, but he just didn't capture the emotions that were deeply rooted in this film. He read lines, gave some expression, but that was all. I saw Ryan Gosling playing the character and not Noah on screen. His eyes are what hurt him the most. They just didn't seem to fit with what the character was trying to convey. Each time the camera moved to his eyes, the film lost more credibility. To build a great film that this could have been you need to staple it with strong players, sadly, this did not happen with The Notebook. Feathers trying to be paperweights instead hold down this story.Then we have the story. Sparks has a great imagination, and this story seemed like it would make a great story to tell on the written page, but not in film. There were too many loose ends that were not covered or given enough respect for me in this film. Allie's parents are one of them. Allie's dad was hysterical looking as I kept hoping that I would see him whip out some Dapper Dan somewhere in the film. Allie's Mom, Joan Allen, is not given enough time to defend herself and her climactic moment at the end seems a bit forced and boring than emotional. We don't have enough information on her or this other character to really care about her big scene, instead it feels just like 'filler'. There should have been more with Sam Shepard, who conveniently did not make it till the end of the film. It felt as if he was written away because nobody knew what to do with him. The same can be said of James Marsden's character who arrives, conquers, and leaves with no emotional response. With many of these moments I felt we were given the short, short, short version instead of the emotional powerhouse this could have been. The final scene that I found myself laughing at immensely was the entire 'Noah going to war' bit. The emotional scene during this brief interlude was completely forced and implausible. I needed more during this moment to have my heart wretched out of me, and not just a scene to tie up any loose ends. Cassavetes could handle this film, I think he just chose to throw too many elements into the fire that he could not fully develop, which hurt him in the long run.Overall, this film could have reached new levels, but instead cheapened itself to cater to those with low emotional control (the weepy) and lovers. Everyone in love has their own story to tell that would probably make another person tear up, but that is what makes it your own. Cassavetes did not build a strong film with The Notebook, but instead used common clichéd Hollywood techniques to give the audience what they were hoping for, shallow characters that will make you cry. Well, if you are looking for a film that literally cuts the drama and gives you the tears, this would be the film for you. To everyone else, I say skip it. There are better dramas that will burst your tear ducts longer than this one! Grade: ** out of *****",3,5,12,16 February 2005
Madagascar," Remember, cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.
","I would have to disagree with most critics about this film. This was not a boring film at all  it was pointless. I literally walked out of this viewing trying to think about what this film was all about. It wasn't that it was confusing in any way (honestly, overly simple), it was just that NOTHING HAPPENED. Normally, in cinema, you have an introduction, something happens, it tries to get resolved, then you have that climactic ending that everyone talks about for weeks. None of this happened in Madagascar. For an hour and twenty minutes I sat, nearly falling asleep, as decently animated creatures used horrid voices and clichéd references to move the plot of the story. Throw in an overused song and some semi-racist moments, and you have the film called Madagascar. Pointless indeed.In contrast to what everyone else seems to think about the animation of this film, I was impressed. It was a different style than what was used in Dreamworks other works like Shark Tales and Shrek. Instead, the animation on this film seemed more comic, as if I was reading the story that was taking place directly from my morning newspaper. It seemed flat, and to me, it worked. I really liked the way that Alex the lion looked, and the way that the animators drew him. In a world so infused with CGI and computer animation, this seemed and felt like it was a step backwards. It felt more like the animation of what Disney used to create, which appealed to me. Sadly, that was all that appealed to me about the film. Visually I was on board allowing my eyes to enjoy the moments, but with everything else it seemed overdone, clichéd, and pointless.Sadly, unlike most films, the bad outweighs the good in this film. Outside of the plot being completely pointless, the actors who voiced our characters did not give us anything worth remembering. Ben Stiller is overused, and with his current influx in the film market, I only see his stock going bottom-up in the near future. Chris Rock managed to squeak out his worst performance in years as a one-dimensional character that focus' solely on himself. With no emotion or care, it seemed like every word out of his mouth embodied some racial stereotype that was toned down for a PG or kid-friendly audience. To add to more of the pointless nature of the film was Jada Pinkett Smith, who proved that Will is the breadwinner for the family. Her character was so underdeveloped that I nearly forgot that she was in the film after the opening credit sequence. Everyone was shallow, unsubstantial, and just your seemingly overused technique in the film industry. I was surprised that anyone was able to take these actors for any more then ten minutes, much less an hour and a half.I am getting tired of the Pro-American; New York City has so much tragedy, moments in movies. While I will agree that what happened on September 11th was horrid in nature, there is no reason to announce that New York is the best city in the world. I live in a wonderful city, that has a zoo, and probably has animals that would have acted just like these in Madagascar, but instead I had to watch as pro-New York actors did whatever they could to promote a city that needs no more screen time. I am just so tired of this in movies and Madagascar seemed to drill it in even more. I think it had to do with the fact that there was no story present to overwhelm these slight discomforting moments. In most films you have an engrossing story that sometimes patches these slow moments where jokes becomes drills and instead of laughing you get headaches. With Madagascar there was no story, so we were forced for an hour and a half to listen to jokes that were not funny. How old is the film Castaway? Did we need to use this joke in this film? Oh, and if that joke didn't work, how about the overuse of words like 'crack-a-lackin' which sent a shiver down my spine every time that zebra said it. Poor writing lead to a non-existent story, which ultimately lead to me nearly falling asleep in this film.Finally, the penguins were the life of this film, and we could have used more screen time with them. In fact, if the entire film were to be made on just these little tuxedoed creatures, I would be the first in line to see it. They were cute, actually had funny lines, and highlighted some of the more creative scenes of the film. The same could be said for the monkey's that somehow were forgotten about. There were some really creative moments to this film that were just overshadowed by the horrid rank of the rest of the film. For example, one of my favorite moments (and only moment) was when Alex picked up the phone to call for help, and all the humans heard were growls. That was an interesting concept that could have been built up a bit more, but instead, we were forced to witness growing scenes with 'We like to move it, move it' being overplayed in the background. That song was just another hole in this already sinking ship.Overall, I was not impressed and thought this was one of the worst children's films released in years. From the poorly valued voices to the completely missing plot, this film gave kids the impression that if you go against who you are truly meant to be, to want to be out in the wild and be yourself, wellbe prepared to loose friends. This film was a disgrace to children and vegetarians everywhere! Grade: * out of *****",1,9,17,19 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," It's a terrible joke... But thank you for coming.
","I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year. While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X-Men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history. I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best 'character study' films of the year. That this sequel was more than just good vs. evil, but also an inner dilemma between Parker's personal lives and that which he has been called to do. While this may have been the case, what actually translated onto the screen was a reassurance that Toby Maguire was miscast, Kirsten Dunst is loosing her sexual appeal (though Raimi felt enough self-guilt to place her in water to reveal her 'bits and pieces' for the pre-teen in all of us), and that you can go too far with a villain creating a cartoon instead of a physically frightening creature.So, where do I begin? At first I had hope, here we find ourselves following Peter as he attempts to get to work after noticing that he was running late. He has just a few minutes to deliver some pizzas (oh, how the mighty do fall) or he will be fired from his job. He apparently really needs this job, so he resorts to transforming himself into his alter-ego personality Spider-man to help him get out of the tight situation. While we are stunned by this cheap display of his super powers, we assume that it will show that Spider-man is a crafty guy. Immediately, we are proved wrong as Peter Parker is fired and forced to go back to his run-down apartment that he cannot afford. Instead of showing us a hero for children to look up to, we have a guy that says to the youth of our nation, be late to work, don't pay rent, and everything will be just fine. This is not the character that I was hoping for. This only leads us deeper into the mind of Peter Parker as he struggles to maintain a very busy life. Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up. When life throws you lemons, go ahead and cry like the babies that you are, or at least like Toby Mcguire has patented.Spider-man is not the hero for our youth. He is not the passionate crime-fighter that we have envisioned or at least that was drawn for me in the first film. Instead, Toby is given the possibility to 'grow' his character and give him '5000 dimensions' that continually fail. He uses the technique of huge-teary eyes to portray the struggle that is happening inside of him. He never really feels strong. He never really makes a decision. He only does what the villain forces him to do. He continually remains indecisive and weak through all moments of this film. I lost respect of his heroine status. I instead saw him as this whiny kid that couldn't handle the pressures of the job that he was handed. He cries, and is wimpy instead of showing a true emotional struggle. This only proved to me that you couldn't take an independent actor, one that prides himself on the dramatic element, and give him a role in a huge-budget film. I once thought of this in the first film, but this sequel only proves my theory correct.This goes the same for Kirsten Dunst, who progressively became uglier throughout the film and whose bosoms fluctuated in size in nearly every shot. She was drenched yet again for the pre-teen audience and for those that like to use the stop-motion feature on their DVD player. She was useless, and perhaps should be replaced for the third installment to this series. Finally, there was the unsupportive villain that seemed less 'evil' and more like a cartoon Elmer Fudd, constantly messing up and not really causing any chaos or destruction. He didn't frighten the people of Spider-man's city, so why should I be frightened of him? Molina was horribly cast as Doc Ock, only proving that a large man with tons of robotic work can be evil, or at least try to be evil.Finally, I would like to say that Raimi needs to go back to his roots. For me to ever be interested in one of his films again (especially after this sequel), I would need to see Raimi go back to his roots. He needs less money, better scripts, and an unknown cast that can prove themselves and try something new. All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters. It was sad, it was poor, and it was an inexcusable issue. Raimi is a 'cult' film director that has eyes the size of Toby whenever money is thrown his way. This was a very poor film. It was exactly what Hollywood represents and the type of film that I despise. There was no substance, no structure, and nothing exciting about this sequel. It was, for lack of a better word, very poor. I am embarrassed to say that I have seen this film, and will deny it whenever anyone asks. This is my final word on this film. Good-bye!

Constantine," A film for those that loved The Prophecy...
","I must begin by saying that I have not read the Hellblazer comics, nor did I know anything about Constantine before viewing this film. So, perhaps I went in blindly and that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. I will say that upon viewing this movie I am very interested in reading the Hellblazer comics and learning more about our unpopular hero, John Constantine, especially since he is mentioned in some of the Sandman series (which is one of my favorite Neil Gaiman stories). I think one of the reasons I thought that this movie was 'utterly uber cool' was because it focused less on action, more on a defined story. When you see the previews for Constantine and you are a fan of The Matrix, you will be very disappointed. This is not so much an action film as it is a character study with themes of religion and compassion. While there are some powerful scenes of violence, the central focus is around Constantine and his plight to enter Heaven. He embodies the everyman's struggle to get into the pearly gates at the end of our great journey through life. Even though he has done so well fighting for Heaven, there are outside forces that fight against him. That is the central struggle of the film. It wasn't Constantine vs. the Devil as I think several of our fellow critics think. This was not The Matrix, but instead a film that stood sturdily by itself.I am an enormous fan of the series The Prophecy. I thought that Christopher Walken brought a completely new spin on the angel character as well as screenwriter/director Gregory Widen expanded the playing field of Heaven and Hell and showed us a new creative story that seemed utterly real. This is the same as I felt with Constantine. Here we have a growing and constantly changing world, above and below us, that feeds on our souls. While they do not interfere directly, there are elements of our day to day life that will guide us on the path of destruction or salvation. It is the great gift of free will that gets us to our ultimate destination. That concept of free will is also detailed in this film. Christopher Walken grappled with it in The Prophecy films and the amazing Tilda Swinton dwelled heavily on it in this one. It was great to see the consistency of the Gabriel character. It is hard to explain, but this is the concept I loved the most. The idea that Heaven and Hell do really exist and it is ultimately our choice which one we will end up in. Also, director Francis Lawrence's vision of Hell was disturbingly original. I loved the concept that it is just like Earth, except more terrifying. The two times that we visited it in this film my jaw was on the floor. It was amazing just to see another viewpoint on an age-old concept.I thought casting for this film, especially the high budget production that it was, was exceptional. Tilda Swinton nearly stole the entire film, if it hadn't been for Peter Stormare's turn as Satan. I was also very impressed with the acting ability of Gavin Rossdale. When I had first heard that he was going to be in this film, I had my doubt, but he pulled through and was a great choice for the sleazy demon named Balthazar. While I just didn't enjoy Shia LaBeouf's character portrayal in this film, it was the coupling of the other actors that kept me going. Keanu did exactly what I wanted him to. He played this really cool anti-hero that had been to Hell and back while not being afraid of what was to come. He embodied the struggles that Constantine had to deal with while also bringing out that sense of humanity that I don't know if other actors could have done. He also was able to capture some great chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who was a strange choice for a big budget film, but turned out for the best. If the story doesn't impress you as much as it did me, then at least you can be happy with the acting. I thought that it stood out as one of the better lineups in this year's cinema releases.Finally, the last aspect that I enjoyed were the small details that if you were not paying attention you would miss. The cultural mix of fantasy and reality was perfection. The Nazi flag in the beginning coupling to the character of Papa Midnight (possibly Father Time) just seemed to click with me. I know this story arrived from a graphic novel, but I thought that director Francis Lawrence did his homework and should be very proud. The colors and tone of the entire film never became light nor was it ever positive. This is a dark work, and Lawrence showed it. The only down side to this entire movie was the Hollywood influence on the final cut. There were two scenes that I could just feel that big studio bosses forced Lawrence to make either to get a laugh or to have some sort of completion. Either way, the two scenes were pointless and really felt forced. You could tell that they just were not meshing well with the rest of the film.Overall, I was impressed. I cannot wait to get my hands on some of the Hellblazer stories and read more about this hero from beyond. This film got me psyched about watching The Prophecy and see the war between Heaven and Earth fought again. I have to warn you through, this is not an action film. This is a character study of one John Constantine, which is more dramatic than action. A perfect blend of CGI and modern culture, Constantine is exactly what I needed to tie me over until Sin City.Grade: ***** out of *****",9,7,22,23 February 2005
Troy," Careful boy, my mercy has limits.
","My feelings on Troy are mixed. While I did enjoy the action/war scenes that reminded me of Lord of the Rings, there was the small detail to the story and plot that just completely blew my mind. Why, if you are going to make a history epic such as this, would you focus so intently on the characters that the story (which should have been the star of the film) pretty much falls to the wayside? I think that it has something to do with who you have carrying your story. If you have actors that are a little less defined in their careers, perhaps you would focus more on the story giving us the way that Homer would have been happy with. Instead, we headline huge actors to carry the roles and focus more on the shirtless wonders of the world instead of the written word. It is sad and unforgivable at the same time.To begin, let me tell you what I really liked about this film, which shouldn't take up too much space, but is still worthy of mention. I loved the grand scale of this film. When I read Homer's work, I didn't think of this tiny little incident that felt and looked like a back lot to a movie studio. I wanted epic visions of land, wars, and chaos. I wanted to be placed right in the action by being transported to the era visually and audibly. Director Wolfgang Petersen did this with the greatest of ease. This is a big production film, and he never allowed us to forget that. Second, I enjoyed the smaller stories of this film. The hints and references made to the culture at the time that allowed those three years of Latin class, Greek Mythology, and history of Troy seemed to constantly keep a grin on my face and my mind in motion. It reminded me of Disney's Hercules, one of the most under-appreciated Disney films out there. There were subtle hints and clever moments that just placed that intelligent smile on your face. Troy did the same even threw in a couple 'fun' CGI moments for everyone to share, but sadly that was it.If you could turn the sound off on your television or surround sound and watch this film, you probably will experience a better picture than I did. From the opening scene until the very anti-climactic moment in Troy, the hardest trouble that I had was the accents that accompanied our actors. Brian Cox is one of the worst as I nearly found myself laughing in hysteria when he bellowed his first lines in a very un-Greek British accent. This was followed by Orlando Bloom dawning a very unmasculine British accent coupled with Peter O'Toole looking very un-Trojan in his element. If that wouldn't have been the tip of the ice cream, we were allowed to add sprinkles with the grunting force of Brad Pitt as our heroine/anti-heroine Achilles. Taking moments from Rocky and Cobra, Pitt gives us his worst performance to date as a man given the strength of millions, but the emotions of a child. It is sad to see Pitt butcher such an amazing character and never look back in suspicion. This was not the role for him, and somebody (even the best boy) should have stepped out of his place to inform the Hollywood hitter that perhaps he was making a grave mistake. Unfortunately, nobody came through and Troy was created and the power of Fight Club was thrown right out the window. Corporate Hollywood had its field day in the Trojan sun.Another steaming issue that I had with this film was the pacing and timing of the overall picture. Why did it take two hours to get to the most popular moment of the film? Why did Petersen bog the viewers down with idle moments of passion and unnecessary character development when really we were most interested in learning about the infamous 'Trojan Horse' and the 'Achilles Heel' references? I would hate to say it, but those were two of the reasons why I was very interested in seeing this film. I wanted to see Petersen's portrayal of this historical moment, but instead what I discovered was that choppy editing left too much on the sandy desert floor. It felt, at least to me, that the ending was very rushed and very underdeveloped. The ending seemed cheaper to me, and without giving anything away, almost out of the precedent set forth by the beginning of the film. I think Petersen knew that he had run out of time and the budget was already too big, so the ending was forced to suffer. This ultimately hurt the film more than helped it giving it that sensation of a two-week science project done the night before. I felt sorry for those involved with this droopy ending.To be honest, you had a very powerful story here that failed due to corporate Hollywood deciding to cast big names to fill the parts and place more emphasis on who was going to get the most screen time instead of story. The actors hurt this film more than most will imagine because they just never fully represented the power of Homer's work. I would have never imagined seeing Brad Pitt fighting along in Greek/Trojan times, and even after seeing this film I still cannot. Brian Cox, normally fascinating in every film he does, just fell flat on his face in this film with the yelping of British words during this era. It didn't fit causing the epic to quickly transform into nothing for that another summer blockbuster. The story didn't help much either, forcing us to desperately want to get back into our High School Latin class to relive the truth of the story one last time.SEMPER UBI SUB UBI!!!

Insomnia," There are two kinds of people in Alaska...
","In 2002 I went to the theaters and saw Insomnia on the big-screen. I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams  a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together. I was wrong. I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast. I was not disappointed. I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles. I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play  and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit. I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, cliché ending. I was in awe of this film  that is  until I saw the original. Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision. It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the 'How to build a great climax' handbook handed to new  mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good. If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen. I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments. To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations. While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his 'unknown' past, Pacino brings a visual to the character. You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is. There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the 'bad cop' mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer. Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt. A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Nolan's discreet changes morphs this film into something completely different that originally conceived. To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake. It is a new interpretation of a classic film. Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film. For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood 'running' in Nolan's film than in the original. Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace. Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely. That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form. This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical. Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months. It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia. So, where does that put us currently? I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say 'no' to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his 'dark' stint). I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films. I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best. Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino can not compete.Grade: *** ½ out of *****",7,0,0,25 November 2006
L.A. Confidential," Will this review put me on the QT? How about Hush-Hush?
","In 1997, five films were up for the category of best picture  of those 'LA Confidential' was a contender. It was an up and down year for the Academy, having the highest grossing picture on the ticket doesn't really allow room for small independent features to see the light of day. Thankfully, 'Good Will Hunting' proved that wrong, and allowed the comedian Robin Williams to receive the credit he deserved. None the less, 'LA Confidential' was in the gambit that year, boasting hot new talent, an awe-inspiring image of the golden years of Hollywood, and the grittiness that only James Ellroy could imagine. So, with so many high marks  why didn't this film win? To be honest, my friends, this isn't a very good movie. As other reviews have claimed, and I agree, it is a popcorn film. It has gloss, it has catchy music, and it has veneer, but it lacks the soul to be an award winner. 'LA Confidential' is a motion picture. In the gambit of releases, it requires one viewing to see where both Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce first found their Hollywood USA footing, but outside of that  it only demonstrates one thing  Kim Basinger didn't need to put her best foot forward to win an award.Wow. Isn't that opening paragraph grouchy? My initial feelings for this film were not as negative as I may sound, it does require one viewing, but alas, this was my second time around and frustration has set in due to the missing hours I cannot get back. 'LA Confidential' is a film that boasts truths (i.e. there was a club that had women cut like movie-stars for men), or the dirty cops, but ultimately lacks that punch to make it feel  well, real. Let me explain. Upon watching this film a second time, one could notice places where the actor's voices were not synchronized to their lips; one would feel as if they were on a soundstage instead of the actual location, and finally, perhaps the largest downfall, the secondary actors not quite fitting their respected roles. I don't mean to tear apart an award winner, the people have spoken and it has already won, but it should go under scrutiny just like anything else Hollywood recycles. 'LA Confidential' needed to be darker, it needed further development into our main characters, and it needed more blood  more truth, more honest, more detail. Boasting speaking parts of over 80 people is great, but when there wasn't a strong enough story to support them, it just falls apart at the seam.With so much distress, I must admit, there were parts I enjoyed. I loved the costumes, the fantasy of this missing Hollywood. The freedom during the time seemed stronger than ever, and Hanson captured this greatly. The music countered the film greatly, focusing our attention on the time with upbeat songs and jingles. Finally, I did like where Russell Crowe went with his character. His was the only one that I believed, and trusted to portray a cop still fighting the struggle with his past. He was the darkness that we needed for this film; his character alone represented what 'LA Confidential' should have been. He was worth watching and should have been presented with his first Oscar, but I digress. Alas, this is all I can say  the rest seemed like a downward scramble into the pit of despair.Overall, I wasn't happy with this film. 'LA Confidential' could have been the small film that knocked Titanic off its shelf, but because it was so glossed over, because it lacked the grittiness, it just felt like a Hollywood-churned product. It duped the audiences. It promised this dark world of corrupt cops and staunch criminals, but did not deliver. I wanted this to be a great noir film, a great feature to the likes of 'The Untouchables', but this comes nowhere close. Hanson tries to stay mainstream with this film, but could have succeeded by bringing his own image to the table. I cannot stress this enough, this is a Hollywood film. It is everything Hollywood represents from predictable plots, to friends finding roles for other friends (see DeVito and Basinger), and bloodless shootouts. Even with all the production value going into it, we still couldn't get Crowe's voice to match his lips. Pathetic.One viewing  that is all you will need. I promise.Grade: * out of *****",2,13,37,8 December 2008
MASH," M.A.S.H. the TV Series ... Great! M.A.S.H. the Movie ... humph!
","The story (or at least the little vignettes of it) were simple, the characters could have been multi-dimensional (yet simple), and the environment could have added to that overwhelming need for comedy, but instead Altman did nothing to connect these simple ideas. Perhaps it was pioneering to see surgeons during the Korean War at work, but it added nothing to the overall film  no comedy, no insight, no charm  just a way to prove to the viewers that these men were actually men of medicine. 'M.A.S.H.' had all the inner-workings of a great comedy, the scene was set, and the overhead announce had his funny lines, but, sadly, this film never quite found its stride. From the actors to the continuity to the muddled themes, 'M.A.S.H.' was genuine for its time, but watching it now, in 2008, it feels dated and overwhelmingly tiresome.What a treat it was to see the groundlings of such great actors like Donald Sutherland, Eliot Gould, Robert Duvall, and even Tom Skerritt. To see these infamous character actors in their youthful prime is worth one star already, but that may be it. We cannot fault Altman for not giving these characters souls, because they did. Hawkeye had his whistle and martini, Gould had his brutal honesty, and well, Frank had his religion and his 'Hot Lips', but alas, our guys never took them further. These characters were strong in their individual moments, such as when Hawkeye is borrowing the Jeep at the beginning of the film, but, like the others, he suddenly falls flat and uncharismatic throughout the rest of the film. Duvall's Frank was another character that could have been a staple through the rest of the film, but again, just jumped without reason and walked off the screen. While we were not hoping for other war films just to be reinvented, we were hoping for some form of structure with our characters that would allow us to see their growth, see their souls, and give us a reason to follow them into the operating room or, oddly, onto the football field. They had jokes that would make us laugh, words that would inspire, and goofiness that would only befit Altman, but there was something desperately lacking with our guy near the front line. Sutherland was fun, but as I watched, he was Donald Sutherland in a G.I. outfit. It was Duvall pre-'The Apostle'. It was Tom Skerritt being, well, Tom Skerritt. This was the ultimate shortfall for this cast. They could not shake their own personalities  their own selves for these roles. Concluding with this feeble football game that came from nowhere (supposedly fitting in with the tangents of war), that gave us no emotional throwback for these characters  we were left with shells of what could have been. Not knowing the original 'theme song' to this film, the 'suicide' song set the wrong tone for the beginning of this film. Sure, the morbid nature seemed to fit with what was happening in the operating room, but during the off chance that we knew what was happening in there, it just didn't seem to fit. Then, when the dentist has his moment of sanity, we are returned to that same song. It felt like one big cliché that Altman didn't want to acknowledge. While the television music could not be shaken from my mind, this little ditty needed to be erased completely. Aside from the song, mentioned before, there was just no story to this Korean caper. 'M.A.S.H.' would have been a stronger outing as smaller stories within one connecting story instead of trying to just keep it all continuous. At one moment we are listening to Hot Lips and Frank, in another we are fighting for a Korean boy to not join his national army, and then to wrap it up, we are playing in a cliché football match-up with an outcome everyone expected. It felt like Altman had the ideas; he just didn't know how to connect them all cohesively. The thought probably being that he could connect them through the surgery room banter was not worth the printed reel, while the guy doing the announcements at camp was not a close enough second place. I wanted to like the quirkiness of the characters; I wanted to see the juxtaposition of the tragedy of the war, with the comedy of the doctors. I wanted to see Sutherland use humor to alleviate the blood of war  alas  this never happened. I chuckled once during the big Hot Lips shower scene, and that was it. There was a level of brevity with Altman's war-torn camp, but at times it felt more along the lines of apathy. Nobody cared, nobody had heart, nobody showed emotion except for Frank, and he was less than a secondary character. Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with the praise that Altman has received for this film. 'M.A.S.H.' may have been a pioneering film for the time, but over the years it has become more and more chaotic, and less meaningful. Altman's control over his characters and story is non-existent, as he just added short story over non-connective short story in hopes to make at least a two-hour long feature film. Add in Sutherland's semi-annoying whistle, and we have monumental film that seemed avante-guard for the time, but now just feel misleading. Remember, this was pre-'M.A.S.H.' the television show, which was a defined comedy/drama show. Looking back at the film, it did work in simple 30 minute segments, so perhaps Altman was thinking television while he made this  that would make stronger sense for the continuity issue. Either way, 'M.A.S.H.', with the cast and director had bigger hopes in my eyes, but was let down in the long run. Time has nearly corrupted this film, and even with our current war standings  it just doesn't relate.Grade: ** out of *****",4,11,21,21 May 2008
Closer," i can't take my mind off of you...
","Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer. I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him. His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began. He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one. So, I was happy with his performance. I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film? At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it. This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling. It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes. This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one. After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in. This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture. Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was. Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen  Oh, Mr. Owen  there could be nobody greater. He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level. I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan. He does not disappoint in this film. Then there is the snivelly Jude Law. I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive. He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up. If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa. He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene. Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters  I dunno  but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place. One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease. I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years. You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring. I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols. It impressed me. Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene. You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth. It was cinematic history in the making.Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected. Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together. Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences. It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart. It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have. I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society and culture. He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film. I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different. He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle. I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate. It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism. I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it. I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response. Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision. It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it. I am impressed.Grade: **** out of *****",9,3,5,29 April 2005
Elf," You sit on a throne of lies!
","This review took me some time to write, rewrite, and confirm my thoughts. Over the course of two days, I had to think about this film to make sure that I was putting my correct words down on paper. This film was reminiscent of an airplane take-off. As the plane begins for take-off it taxis around the runway (opening credits) and then gets its engines up to full throttle before eventually lifting into the air (the beginning of the film), but once in the air, we coast and outside of some brief turbulence, you have a smooth flight the rest of the trip. That is how I felt about the film Elf. Director Favreau (of Swingers fame) bursts onto this film with such raw imagination and humor that by the time he gets to New York City, he is panting for air and eventually tired of the entire endeavor. With a medium to medium rare Ferrell, Favreau starts this story with amazing imagery, some moments of classic Christmas television memories, and powerful creativity, but in the end it all reads like a Hollywood playbook. Everyone is in their positions, let's play a good game.Ferrell is a very funny actor. In fact, I praise him for the return of the 'funny' comedy with his work in Anchorman, but in this film it just feels as if he is going through the motions without the emotion. You could tell that he just didn't feel as comfortable in his role of Buddy as he did as Ron Burgundy. Farrell, and perhaps it was more the writers fault, provided no really memorable lines that the kids will be quoting for years to come nor did he do anything that wasn't already expected of him. I don't think this was his sled, for lack of a better word. Then again, perhaps it didn't work for me because he didn't have the backup he needed. Ferrell is one of those comic geniuses that play off other actors very well and some of the most memorable Ferrell moments are when he is ad-libbing with others. James Caan was a horrible choice as the father. He is cranky, yes, but not from acting. I couldn't help but cringe when I saw him at the end of this film, he was pathetic. I couldn't tell if he was interested in this film, or just needed some extra cash. I felt the same about the rest of the cast that surrounded Ferrell. Deschanel and Steenburgen were completely miscast and literally just walked through the motions spewing lines from their mouths to pay for their new car. The best example is when Zooey says to Ferrell, 'You missed' during the romantic scene. It was worse than poor and amateurish. Wasted talent from Sedaris and Richter only angered me further. The only saving actor from this entire film was Dinklage. He was hysterical and commanded the screen for the few minutes he was on literally stealing the scene from Ferrell. It was a plus in an already full film of minuses.For this film to really be pinnacle Christmas achievement, it needed some powerful writing that would just have you in your seat laughing because of the words behind Ferrell. Sadly, that could not be found in this film. There wasn't enough originality in the script to make this film really stand out. I saw a glimmer of it when the film began with some of the CGI animals, but that was lost indefinitely after the first ten minutes. When I first started watching this film, I saw it as a combination of all of our favorite Christmas programs. This perception ended when Buddy made it to New York. Riding in a cliché drawn horse and sleigh, we follow Buddy through New York as he attempts to bring humor to the simplest of situations. It felt as if when Favreau found a joke, he never let it go, nearly killing the fun each time. The syrup joke is the first that comes to mind. The second was entire Central Park episode. Everyone involved couldn't pick up the pieces from that 'crash and burn'.While it sounds like I am sitting here furiously upset with this film, I am not. I went into the film with high expectations, but was left with only medium results. Ferrell was funny, but not Ferrell-funny. He was scripted, almost to the point where you could count his beats. This was a holiday movie, but not one that will be played over and over again in this house. Overall, it was disappointing, but thanks to a little help from Dinklage, it seemed just a tad bit better.

Notting Hill," Whoopsidaisies!
","I first saw this film when it was released in May of 1999. I saw it as an instant love comedy classic combining the taste of Noel Coward as well as the subtle wit of Four Weddings and a Funeral. There was something original about this tale, something that just made the entire movie-going experience monumental. I was very impressed with both the talents of Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, and newcomer (that would eventually make a name of his own) Rhys Ifans. I loved the modern fairy-tale story that Richard Curtis created (and would soon repeat again and again with success) and felt that the chemistry between Grant and Roberts could not have been done by anyone else. America's sweetheart coupled with Britain's poster-child was immaculate. This was a near perfect film that could be rediscovered again and again.Sadly, I still haven't bought this film, but when my wife and I chose to rent it the other day, I was curious to see if the emotions and excitement that I felt when I initially watched it would survive in the year 2005. Sometimes films have this uncanny habit of becoming dated and musty with age. The jokes seem to be less funny, the characters seem old (because Hollywood may have recycled them in other films), and overall the film just feels like 1999. As I watched this film again, the first time in several years, it became obvious early on that it did not age in any way. The jokes still had me rolling around in my chair with laughter, the quirkiness of the characters still redefined Britain, and Julia Roberts still shined in one of her best roles to date. It was impressive to see how well preserved Curtis was able to keep this body of work.The characters are what preserve this film so well. I do not think that Hollywood has ever recreated Rhys Ifan's Spike, and if it has it was not as memorable. Hugh Grant is an awesome screen presence with his quick tongue and insecure personality. I have always been a fan of Hugh Grant's work, and am constantly impressed with the resume he has built. Julia is, well, Julia. While some will argue that she plays the same character over and over again, I would have to agree. She is a typecast character, but in Notting Hill it works. She is supposed to play herself, and she pulls it off with the greatest of ease. I did not see this film as a stretch for Julia, but an opportunity to show the world what Grant has to offer. He successfully built this multi-dimensional character that believed in love so deeply that once it was given to someone, it could never be taken back. You don't see that sort of theme in the cinema today. Even the cheesy 'boy and girl' line was not as bad as other films. I thought that it fit perfectly and gave Grant a reason to continue. Nothing could be as bad as 'You had me at Hello'. To see a cheesy romantic comedy last through time is due to the work of Richard Curtis' screenplay and some amazing (yet simple which is why this film works so well) direction of Roger Michell.Overall, I felt the story was bold and imaginative. The characters were played with so much respect and dedication that it felt almost real. It was a love story that has lasted the test of time due to the huge talent and simplistic themes. I laughed through this film again in 2005 just as hard as I did in 1999. That says something about a film if it can still evoke the same emotion nearly six years later. I am impressed with this movie, and with everyone involved. Go see it if you haven't yet, I know you will not be disappointed.Whoopsidaisies! Grade: ***** out of *****",10,6,8,13 January 2005
Armageddon," A Framed Picture that would make Norman Rockwell proud...
","If Norman Rockwell and Orson Scott Card had a child, in a bizarre new world, they would have written the screenplay for 'Armageddon'. An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clichés that it becomes an entertaining, full-throttle action film that can be watched again and again. With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique. In this reviewer's eyes, 'Armageddon' is one of those films where Bay has tricked the common audience. It is a typical summer blockbuster in every sense of the word, there are explosions, there are great lines, there are out-of-this world scenes, but he does this while incorporating hidden messages throughout. Perhaps I am looking a bit too deep into just another science fiction action film, but when 'Armageddon' came through the DVD player, I wasn't ready. I was a nay-sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now  in 2008  it makes perfect sense. Michael Bay has created a picture-perfect image of America. He has taken our desire for the inanimate, our non-perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film. Yes, this is a science fiction film, yes this is the film about the big asteroid that only Bruce Willis can stop, and yes  Ben Affleck does attempt to act  but it is perfection. If our country was eliminated, and we needed a film for our history books  I wouldn't argue with 'Armageddon'. Now, let's let the argument begin.The acting, come on, it's 'Armageddon' people, but Bay is notorious for at least creating enjoyable characters. Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason. The looming voice-over by Charlton Heston seemed to suck me into the story, while Willis and Affleck's banter seemed over the top, and at times annoying. They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat. Liv Tyler gave it her all, and the way Bay filmed her (less words more emotion) was perfect. She carried the weight of her father and soon-to-be fiancé well into the asteroid. Compliments should be handed to Mr. Thornton as well, the man has a pair of chops on him, and if he could avoid the angry comedian films, he could remember that he has the talent. He was the epitome of NASA, the genius that had to work on the worst budget to save the world. Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly. Willis' character reminded me of a mortal superhero. His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen. 'Armageddon' played like a comic, with your muscling characters, cheap jokes, picture-esquire landscapes, and simple fix to a big problem. Again, it was cliché  all of these characters can be seen in any other film close to the same nature or entitled 'summer blockbuster', but with Bay, he seemed to be saying more. Affleck was the only downfall on the character side. He was Ben playing Ben; there wasn't that sense of anything outside of comic timing and love interest needed. He wasn't Bruce, he wasn't anyone except filler.The story was simple. Bay simply used the K.I.S.S. method to compile the script (the Keep It Simple Stupid), asteroid headed to Earth, nobody saw it, and it is up to Bruce to surrender to the beast. It is Mr. Michael Bay that must be complimented for this film. While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time. While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it, Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it. Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this 'everyman', the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture. Michael Bay is the director of gluttony. I can attest that I couldn't stand this film upon viewing it the first time. I was horrified to see it in the Criterion gambit, but watching it again  older and wiser with film  I am happy to see it in the collection. 'Armageddon' is America. It is the birth of the superhero, it is the cliché Americana that we face everyday; it is exactly what makes American cinema  well  American. Bay, in this film, has captured the truth. What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film. He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no-brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.Overall, as I begin to sound more and more repetitive, 'Armageddon' - the Criterion release - blew my mind for the first time although it was my second viewing. I am eager to re-watch again Bay's 'The Rock' which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides. The Norman Rockwell vision, the lack of any real science fiction until the third act, and the detail of the characters without devoting hours upon hours to them, made for strong  unparalleled cinema.

American Psycho," You're so vain. You probably think this film is about you.
","Who is Patrick Bateman? A valid question for those reading this review. One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill  kill  and kill again. Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know. Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman. For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer. Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within. Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again. His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw. Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero. Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard. The biggest question is Paul Allen. The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world. Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship  yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him. Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise. Yet, something nags at our belief. This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again. Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings. Slasher film? Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery. There was a film entitled 'What the Bleep Do We Know' that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, 'American Psycho' can do it like no other.For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s  than 'American Psycho' is the film for you. For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community. Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding. His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character  he was Patrick Bateman. What is it with Bale  there hasn't been one underscored performance yet. 'Batman Begins', 'The Prestige', 'Velvet Goldmine', and the 'Machinist' are all within my top films of all time. 'American Psycho' ranks above them all. Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones. The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis. The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history. The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes. Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill known as Christian Bale.I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film, though I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc. I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story. Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry  there is a newer version, the 'Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition' that should remedy all of these missing elements.Overall, 'American Psycho' ranks among one of my favorite films of all time. While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant. I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing. The music is what stood out in my eyes. There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston. I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song. It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film. 'American Psycho' is a look within the business soul. As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the 'Wall Street' arm, could Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father? The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity  all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you. For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America  this is the film for you.Now, I gotta go return some videos.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,1,3,26 March 2007
"I, Robot"," It's a human thing; you wouldn't understand.
","This was an impressive film. Not from the standpoint that it was a great story or with great actors, it was the quickness of the plot that impressed me. I don't normally say this, but the fact that I. Robot moved exactly to the points that needed to be moved without any misleading, poor back story, or cheesy Will Smith moments impressed me. Director Alex Proyas knew exactly how to manage the excessively huge budget and make sure that we, the audience, were getting the biggest bang for our buck. Yes, there were downfalls to this film, but somehow I could overlook them. I will be the first to admit that this was not my favorite type of film. The huge CGI scenes, the grossly overpaid actors, and the disrespect to one of Asimov's infamous books by the same title will really churn your stomach (as it did mine), but unlike the rest of these types of film, I, Robot did something different. It kept the eye candy going throughout the film and really never let your eyes rest. This very imaginative world, almost a fantasy world, had something to keep your eyes busy the entire time, and I loved it. Whether it would be Will Smith's semi-plastic looking Audi, or the Sony created 'Sonny' robots infiltrating the city, your eyes will definitely walk away from this film with bulging bellies and a desire for more.Outside of the visually pleasing aspect of this film, you really don't have much to enjoy. Will Smith's performance is mediocre at best. He tries to do his best throughout the film, but after his introductory shower scene that was completely unnecessary it is only continually going downhill. He tries to play the bad boy style that he patented in such film like Bad Boys to this project, what ultimately fails is his ability to handle the discrimination towards the robots. I never really felt as if he actually disliked them, no matter what the sub-story claimed it just never felt real. I think what ignited this feeling was Chi McBride's role. Don't get me wrong, he is a decent actor, but he was trying to bring his role from Boston Public to this part. He was trying too hard to be the hard-nosed Lieutenant that constantly fought with Spooner, but instead it just came across as Chi being Chi. There wasn't anything exciting about him in the least bit. Looking deeper into all the characters, this is what I felt was a major flaw with this film. The actors really gave nothing spectacular to their roles. They were minimally developed and several of them seemed like Swiss cheese. It felt like wasted talent in this film. Proyas knows better. He knows how to get great performances from his people; I don't know what pulled him from his norm in this project. Cromwell, Greenwood, and even Bridget Moynahan were just hitting that average line. This was yet another glowing example of what happens when money is spent on CGI instead of highly trained actors.So, it looks like we have a superbly visual film coupled with horrible, below the line acting. What did you expect? This was your average action film with superior CGI. I mentioned before on how the visual work is what really kept my eyes glued to the screen, but there was one other element that just rattled my mind. In an attempt not to give the ending away, I will say this much. It is not happy. I do not think that upon viewing the ending of this film you have this sense of joy and comfort knowing that everything is going to be hunky-dory. It is as if you are viewing the beginning chapter to a much bigger story, and that was interesting to me. Proyas is notoriously known for his subtle dark endings that keep you on the brink of wonder (see Dark City), and I, Robot was no exception. It was a brief moment of excitement to see this ending, after a brutal battle sequence where your mind could literally fall asleep because you already know the results, you have this mind-bending ending that really creeped me out. Perhaps I read the ending wrong, but I wasn't at ease when the credits rolled. I snickered because I thought of what could be coming, but definitely not a jump-up-and-down with glee sort of moment. It was strange, but beautifully Proyas.Overall, this was a decent film. I think I would reference this film similar to the way that I felt about the actors, it was just barely hitting the average line. This was better than I expected (which isn't saying much since I was expecting it to be a dud) with really amazing visuals, but you cannot stand on those alone. For this film to really have succeeded, you would have needed to counter balance the CGI with a better story (more details about the laws and more development with Cromwell's character) and much better acting. I see why the producers went with Smith because he is bankable, but he just didn't bring the human element to the table like it was needed. I couldn't see his hatred enough to really bring about his emotional change. I needed more, but found less. Decent, but nothing that will touch my DVD player again.Grade: *** out of *****",5,0,0,3 January 2005
The Alamo," I humble myself before God and there the list ends.
","So, I really didn't like this film at all. I know that seems like there is nothing that I like lately, but for some very strange reason the quality of pictures seem to be diminishing rapidly. As I attempt to watch as much as I can from the video store wall, I cannot help but discover the poor nature of nearly everything Hollywood is releasing. The Alamo is no different. Here we have a group of men lost in a production befuddled film that would rather have the perfect 'visionary' shot instead of actually telling a decent story. Creativity and originality seem to play second fiddle (pun is intended) to safe moments where our director could easily say 'historically correct' instead of showing us any ounce of the truth. There had to be some darkness in that bottomless pit known as the Alamo, yet Hancock didn't seem to focus on that at all. I cannot help but wonder what type of film this would have been for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe to complete. Literally, this film felt like a second-hand thrift store. 'B' actors filling in for table scraped parts that Crowe and Howard didn't want. Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, and Billy Bob just didn't seem to fit the mold that I was hoping to see. They did not accurately portray the 'Wild West' as I was hoping to see. Instead, I felt I was watching this glorified account of death done by pretty actors that would give the ladies a reason to go to the theater.Perhaps I am a bit to bitter about this film. I know that I should only dwell on the positive, but as each film progresses with poor results, it is hard to even see the positive. In fact, after the several films I have just watched I am nearly to the point of saying that Hollywood has gone completely to the dark side. I understand that his was a historical picture, but does that mean that creativity and originality are thrown out the window and into oncoming traffic? I would hope not, but apparently Hancock had other thoughts. From watching the special features of this film in which Hancock talks about the production of this film, he focuses so less on the actors performances and more on the actual set that you can only calculate why there was less attention to the actors and more on the scenery with the final product. As I watched the glorious overhead shots, the wondrous cannonball pan-through, and several other fantastical war scenes, I couldn't help but think to myself on how this should have been a story about people, not places. I do not think that Hancock accomplished this, or  really from the looks of it  tried.With a central focus on the scenery and less on the acting, this creates a level of acceptable mediocrity with our actors. Honestly, there wasn't one that stood out in the crowd as a 'riveting' performance. Each did their parts, brought some historical honesty to their lines, but overall it was Billy Bob being Billy Bob playing Davie Crockett and Jason Patric being Jason Patric playing Jim Bowie. I don't know if this makes sense or not, but I could not see these actors in their corresponding roles. I half-expected Dennis Quaid to come out of the forest at the end, ripping his shirt off, and pulling a Last of the Mohicans right there in front of God and his country  but he did not. In fact, he really didn't do anything except utter fragmented sentences from his dialogue that created this smart aura around him, when actually it was nothing more than Dennis Quaid being Dennis Quaid playing Mr. Houston. It was, to use a favorite word of mind, pathetic. I couldn't get the actors out of my mind. I couldn't see them in their respective roles, and this hurt the film. Directors have to realize that big names do not equal big film. Smaller, independent names could have carried this film on their shoulders better than these veterans did. Again, I cannot ponder enough about what the dynamics of this film would have been like if Randy Quaid were to jump aboard. Has the two brothers done anything together? I think The Alamo would have been a grand beginning.Overall, this feature did not impress me. I know it bombed horribly at the box office, and now I can see why. There was nothing of value throughout the entire picture. From the uninsightful acting, the glamorized vision of war, and even the complete lack of structure (needing to focus more on man instead of nature), The Alamo proved that big budget can ruin a good history lesson. Sadly, I am not sure what could have saved this picture outside of a complete gutting. Have you ever walked into a room in which the walls were so moldy that you knew that you were going to have to rip them down to build a solid frame? Well, that was the feeling behind The Alamo. The walls to this picture were moldy and completely unstable leading to a flimsy frame. If only more time would have been spent working on the important elements instead of the 'Hollywood' moments, this may have done a bit better. Until that time arrives, I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially those with any sort of passion for our nation's history. I do believe it would cause mass professor spitting and a rebirth of the duel.Grade: * out of *****",2,3,10,27 April 2005
In the Name of the Father," They can't block out the light in here.
","I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films. As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage. From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political 'courtroom' drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison. Due to Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all. Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core. I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion. Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film. He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film. Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world. He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film. It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this. He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life. Then there was Emma Thompson. She was subtle in this film. Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation. The story is what kept me glued to the screen. I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story. We don't watch Gerry grow up. We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father. We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain. We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone. Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments. Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father. I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father. It was like watching a child grow before our eyes. The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending. I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself. I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see. It frightened me to watch it in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent. Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family. He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation. It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me. Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.Grade: **** out of *****",8,0,0,21 March 2006
The Machinist," I'd like to report a hit-and-run.
","I would like to say that I hated the film Monster. You are probably wondering what that has to do with the film The Machinist? Let me tell you. In Monster, Charlize Theron goes 'ugly' in attempt to capture the character that she is trying to portray. She wins an Oscar, not because her acting was good, but because people could not believe that was Theron so 'ugly'. From that point on I was a strong believer that you could dress up the actor all you want, but deep inside it is still the same actor. Charlize Theron ugly is still Charlize Theron. So, needless to say, I was skeptical at first to see how Christian Bale would do with dropping 65 pounds to play the role of Trevor Reznik, an insomniac factory worker with a forgotten secret. Was it going to be like Monster and spend two hours watching Christian Bale play a skinny Christian Bale? I my utter surprise, it was not. Bale, by dropping the weight, accomplished what so many 'physical' actors can only dream about. He gave depth, a physical persona, and a very frightening image to this character that took us away from Bale the actor. Throughout the entire film, I could only see Trevor Reznik. Perhaps it was a trick. Perhaps Bale couldn't do the character otherwise, but for me, a viewer of the film, it helped create the dark ambiance that shook me to the core until the very end.My first applaud goes to director Brad Anderson for his simplistic, yet chaotic filming of this story. Throughout the entire viewing, you are given this impression that something is going over your head. You know that you are missing something and that the ending will shock and amaze you. For anyone that has grown up in the Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense era, you can smell this film coming from a mile away, but it is the way that Anderson provides the story to you that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. After a vast array of 'shock-ending' films, it is hard to come up with a new, original, and tactful idea that will keep audiences talking long after the credits roll. Anderson has done a brave new job with The Machinist in providing that chatter after the film. He showed us his darker side in Session 9 and he doesn't go too commercial in this film. It is haunting, riveting, and challenging all at the same time  to say that about a director's work is rare today.The acting is superb. Jennifer Jason Leigh again gives us the beauty of grime and the ability to transform this very small character into a powerhouse role. She gives so much emotion and humility to her character, which makes you forget (or perhaps not notice) what her true 'profession' is. There are also so many secrets about her that you cannot help but sit around after the film and think of her story outside of how she reacts with Reznik. I don't know if anyone else did this, but I couldn't keep her out of my mind. She was amazing. Then you have John Sharian playing the polar opposite of Bale in such a frightening way that he nearly steals every scene away from Bale. He is huge, bulky, and rather transfixing as perhaps the living conscious of Bale. Following Leigh's feminine role is that of Aitana Sánchez-Gijón playing Marie. This very unknown character that seems to be the only smiling face in the film. She gives comfort to not only Reznik, but also to us. She is our guiding light at the end of this dark tunnel that surprises you to the very end. Then you have everyone that is around Reznik like his co-workers, his landlady, and even himself. A powerful cast that is accentuated with a bold and original story.Finally, I would like to say that outside of the talented acting and bold direction, you actually have an amazing story. I know I have mentioned this several times, but you cannot walk away from this story without discussing it thoroughly with friends and family afterwords. It is like a cinematic drug that you cannot get enough of. I thought that with my second viewing that I would have already seen all that I could, but instead I was provided with moments, mere glimpses of truth, that I just completely missed during the first viewing. It was inspirational to see such dark, yet powerful storytelling to come from a nearly recycled Hollywood. Sure, there are elements of Fight Club, Sixth Sense, and Usual Suspects all mixed into this film, but Anderson gives it his own flare. Bale goes to a new extreme proving that he can manage both big box office hits, and these itty-bitty gems. The Machinist is a refreshing moment for both you and your DVD player.Overall, I really thought this was one of the most powerful films to come out of Hollywood this year. I would love to see Bale take home a golden statue for his portrayal in this film, but I noticed that Charlize Theron is going to be 'ugly' again in North Country, so I think he will be passed up again. Bale is becoming such a strong actor because he is constantly working with the quintessential directors in Hollywood. Not the Bruckheimers, not the Bays, but with these smaller directors that are not afraid to take a leap of faith with Bale. I have not been disappointed with his work, and I think all that watch this film are going to walk away and see Bale as more than just the 'man in a bat suit', but instead a strong voiced actor that can tackle any role.Grade: ***** out of *****",9,1,1,16 October 2005
Gandhi," If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.
","Was Gandhi a great person? The answer will always be 'yes'. Was he a leader in a possibly violent country? This film shows the answer to be 'yes'. Did he deserve a three-hour epic devoted to his life and teachings? This cinephile believes so. Did director Richard Attenborough successfully give his audience an unbiased story of Mohandas K. Gandhi, which included a personal element, a patriotic element, as well as a historical element? Sadly, my response to this is 'no'. There is no doubt in my mind that Attenborough created a beautiful, picturesque view of India controlled by British rule and chose a subject very close to his heart. There is quite a bit of emotion behind the film itself, but I finished watching this picture with a feeling that I didn't quite know Gandhi himself. I knew the work that he had accomplished, the power behind his teachings, but who was this little man from India? That is where I thought Attenborough completely missed the opportunity in this award-winning film. He gave us the images and the one-sided history lesson, but he completely forgot to develop his main character. How did this win so many awards?I realize that the first paragraph of this review contains quite a bit of questions, but they were all questions that I had upon finishing this so-called grandiose epic. To begin, I do not believe that Ben Kingsley should have been awarded what he did for his role. He may have acted the part of Gandhi, but he (at least in my eyes) never looked the part. Here was a man who would stave himself for his people, but after such a long fast, Kingsley looked like he had just finished a couple of pizzas. I think I was expecting a sort of transformation as we saw Mr. Hanks do in Castaway, but alas, my ideas were quenched when Kingsley's belly bulged from his clothing. Also, who was this man? I saw so much passion in Kingsley when the film opened, but after that moment on the train, he seemed to be following his lines on script and leaving his true emotion to the curb. Was he the best actor for the role? I believe that he did a great job of 'acting' like Gandhi, but I do not think he could be labeled as 'the best'. I needed more, sorry, meat to this character. I wanted to see Gandhi when he was in school, outside of the passive protests, with his family, but neither Kingsley nor Attenborough could give us this. I saw Gandhi on the screen, but that doesn't mean that I witnessed a true, strong, character-driven epic before my eyes. I saw beautiful pictures, but not enough about the beauty of this man.Attenborough has the tendency to build really strong biography epics. I enjoyed watching Chaplin, though I didn't think it was a powerful enough story on Chaplin himself, it was nonetheless enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Gandhi, but I just felt that Attenborough fast-forwarded through some of the most crucial elements to this monumental man's life. One of the scenes that I was most looking forward to was Gandhi's powerful pilgrimage to the Indian Ocean. I was ready for this emotional tearjerker that would eventually culminate into demonstrating the true power of this little man. What I instead witnessed was three minutes of Gandhi walking out of his village and suddenly making it to the ocean with no such sign of fatigue or strain. It was mere minutes, when it should have been a bigger scene in this story. That is where Attenborough went wrong. His attention to detail seemed flawed. He was focused on the bigger picture, thus forgetting the power of the smaller stories. A great biography will attempt to do both. It will show the power of this figure on a grand scale, but then zoom in closer to the actual person so that we can see the inner struggles they were facing on a daily basis. A film that correctly gives us this true mix is Nixon. Stone's biography picture does a great job in giving us the man and the nation that didn't stand behind him.Overall, I thought this was an enjoyable film to watch, but a horrid portrayal of this man's life. Throughout the film I continually felt pity for the British rule, and I am assuming that was not what Attenborough wanted to happen during this film. I wanted to see more behind Gandhi, more about the British rule (I do not believe they were as 'evil' as depicted), and more about the people. I needed more information and less sweeping landscape images. There were even a couple of scenes where Attenborough had such great landscape happening that it covered up the words of Gandhi  is that how you build power towards this great man? I wish I could have seen more about the media coverage of Gandhi's life. While Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen were interesting in their own roles, I still felt as if they were so underdeveloped. There should have more connection between these active players and Gandhi. I continued to feel as if they slipped in and out of the scene as fast as Gandhi's 'quick' pilgrimage. Gandhi is a man that deserves to have a motion picture devoted to him, I just do not believe that Gandhi was the film to best represent this powerful man's passionate mission!

Gone with the Wind," A civilization gone with the wind...
","While most will argue with me, I must begin by saying that I was not impressed with the overall final results of this 'epic'. The hype surrounding it, the overuse of Rhett's infamous line in pop culture, and the fact that most people rave about this being one of the most romantic films ever produced set my standards extremely high. I wanted to be blown away by the scenes, I wanted characters that would invite me into their worlds and never make me leave, I wanted tragedy on a grand scale, but alas, that wasn't what I witnessed with Gone with the Wind. Somehow I ending this film with a sense of astonishment, a sense of being robbed, and not at all the romantic film I thought I would be enjoying. Instead I saw hatred, sexism, racism, alcoholism, anti-love, pro-Confederacy, and ignorance all rolled up together into a two-disc packaging, which would be later called Gone with the Wind. It was embarrassing to watch and call as one of our 'greatest love stories ever'. While it may show us what society was like during a pre-Civil War era, that doesn't mean we have to condone it and embrace it.I realize that the point of this film was to show us a different side of the war. That all Southerners were not fueled by hatred and surrounded by a violent slavery system. Instead, there was quite a bit of beauty to the old South. A sense of pride, a sense of gentlemanly nature, and a sense of honor, which was difficult to witness being trampled on as the North continued its destructive war path. In that sense, I think it gave us a glimpse of what we lost with the Civil War. That image of the South was beautifully captured in this film. This film gives us some of the most beautiful sights of lavish plantations, beautiful greens, and civilized parties. The technical aspects of this film are astonishing. While I will agree with most that a widescreen version of this film may have swayed me to giving it one more star, the full screen still demonstrated the amazing sights of the South. The wide shots of the mansions, the bustling Atlanta area, and terror/tragedy of war was beautifully captured in this film. For that, I cannot fault this film, but what I can fault it for are the stereotypes, the shallow characters, and the faded ending that just didn't seem to match the overall tone of the film.To begin, the stereotypes. While most will say that the stereotypes in this film accurately depict the voice of the South, I just didn't feel comfortable watching it in today's society. I realize that this was made back in 1938, but I still didn't feel comfortable with slavery, sexism, and ignorance surrounding these characters. Does that make this film dated? Perhaps if I witnessed our characters going through some form of change I would have softened a bit, but I did not see that at all. With the continual struggles that minorities have in cinema today, is it wise to continue to think of this film as a masterpiece of cinema? Is it worth of all the accolades that it received? No. In fact, I am surprised that this film hasn't been shunned by a majority of communities during each release. This is a pinnacle example of what obstacles African Americans are trying to overcome in today's Hollywood.There are those that speak so highly of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's chemistry, but for me, it was non-existent. I did not see why there are those that fall over this film and praise the story. I thought that Leigh was horrid as the early Southerner turned feminist. Gable was so inconsistent with his character that I didn't know whether to love him or hate him. There was no chemistry or connection between Leigh and Gable. They were together because the director (which this film eventually went through three of them) knew that audiences would want to see them either together or going to get together by the end. The rest of it was just trivial. With the fuzzy direction of Leigh's character, you never quite felt that Scarlett had an ounce of passion in her heart. She wanted what she couldn't have, like a spoiled child, and that was reflected again with the inconsistent ending. Gable's character of Rhett was underdeveloped. We knew nothing about this man except that he randomly continued to jump in and out of Scarlett's life. Where did his wealth come from? What was his past? Who knows Â… and none of it was fully explained. This can be said the same with Ashley. Who was this guy? Why did Scarlett choose him over the other possible suitors? Was it simply because she couldn't have him, or because of some darker reason? Did anyone else notice that she was Irish, not quite the Southern belle that we had originally hoped for? Overall, these characters hurt and built upon the ultimate downfall of this film. They were forgettable from the first time that we met them until the very end of the film. Underdeveloped, unintelligent, and downright dull. All elements that gave us too long of a film centered on nothing.Overall, I just didn't see what all the hype was surrounding this film. Our society has moved forward from this period, but do we need to be reminded of it continually by giving this film more and more accolades? I don't think so. I do not wish to see this film again and hope that it does not continue to be a staple of our cinematic society. From the unexciting, unloving characters (of which we all hate, yet are supposed to love by the end) to smile on Scarlett's face after the marital rape scene, this movie was a disaster.Grade: ** out of *****",4,8,23,18 December 2005
Batman Begins," What chance does Gotham have, when the good people do nothing?
","What can I say that hasn't been said already? I can say 'WOW', but does it carry the same emotion that everyone else speaks about? I don't know, but for me, this was the best summer blockbuster that I have seen in 2005. Christopher Nolan has done his homework, stayed true to dark, graphic stories that follow this hero, and set in place a cast that equally carry the weight of this film on their shoulders. I remember saying to a friend that the reason this film worked was because of the cast. In previous Batman films, we struggled between the over-acting of some, the celebrity status of others, and some that were just plain goofy, but now Nolan has given us a cast that carries this film into a whole new ballgame. They want to be there, they want to embody their characters, they want to give birth to this Dark Knight, and they do. When I first heard about this film being in the pipeline, I was concerned about Christian Bale taking on such a role that has been demolished by the heavy-hitters of Hollywood. Could he do it? I had faith in him, but did everyone else? Apparently they did, because he is the most powerful representation of this tortured figure ever to come out of comic book Hollywood. I applaud his work, appreciated his toned down approach, and cannot wait for him to come back and prove that he is this winged freak.Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Rutger Hauer, Tom Wilkinson, the AMAZING Cillian Murphy, Linus Roache, and Ken Watanabe. With names like this you know that you are walking into greatness. I was worried at first about Caine as Alfred, but with the greatest of ease he turned what could have been the comic character of the film into this powerful voice of Wayne's conscious. It was incredible.While I give so much credit to the actors, I need to equally pay respect to Christopher Nolan. Not since Sin City did I feel like I was watching a graphic novel, a comic, come alive on screen. His ability to frame each shot like a moment in the books, create these breathing characters that you can actually believe exist, as well as tell a story that has been corrupted by the Hollywood recycling machine takes talent and Nolan did it. I have been a huge fan of everything that Nolan has touched. I used to give Memento out for free at the video store just so people could experience the magic that he has. I was a fan of Insomnia and even Followers. I get excited to see his work because it changes with each picture. You never know what you are going to get when you watch a Nolan film, but you can guess that it will be dark and come from his heart. I saw it in his earlier films and it shined brightly in Batman Begins.If I had to say anything negative about the film (which is hard to do) there would be two aspects that I would mention. The first is Katie Holmes. I just didn't like her character. She was underdefined and basically eye-candy for the younger Dawson's Creek audience members. She was worthless, perhaps it was the Tom Cruise media mud-bath that seems to have ruined our newspapers these days, but she just felt plain to me. She didn't make the cut. Then, there were times where you could tell that Bale was really forcing a grumbly American accent. Nothing too wrong with this, but it just felt forced. These were minor insecurities that I had with this overall brilliant film.Outstanding. Perhaps that is a better word for it. I could see this film again and again. From the opening frame to the final moments of battle I was pulled from my theater seat directly into the film. No other Batman film has done that for me. I remember falling in love with Keaton as the Dark Knight, but I think Bale even gave him a run for his money. Nolan created the perfect tone and story for our disturbed hero. He took the goofy elements from Burton, erased Kilmer/Clooney, and brought us back to our roots. This film was perfection on a stick.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,1,3,11 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," We have to get out of this place. It is EVIL.
","Working in the business world, you are constantly told that by hitting your goal, you are just working to your average potential. If you exceed that goal, then you are surpassing your potential. Nearly everyday this is mentioned to me in some form or another, yet I wonder why it wouldn't apply to the business of Hollywood? The bar for Meet the Fockers was set, but for some strange reason, the actors only worked to their goal, and never exceeded it. Riding high off the hysterical Meet the Parents, I thought that this film would bring a new chapter into this 'original' story, but instead director Jay Roach decided to stick with Hollywood standards and recycle the same jokes using different players. I don't know why I am so surprised, I witnessed this before when Roach directed the sequels to Austin Powers. The original film was inventive, original, and hysterical, while the other two films just seemed to recycle the same formula from that original film. The same could be seen in Meet the Fockers. From a similar plot structure, to undefined, clichéd characters, to a complete lack of humor, Meet the Fockers hit their goal, but chose not to exceed it in any way.For a comedy film, I felt this just didn't quite have the punch from the original film. While there were a couple of lines that I found myself chuckling at, there weren't any of those 'laugh-out-loud' moments that I experienced with Meet the Parents. The actors who were in the original seemed bland and really just going through the motions, while the new elements (Streisand and Hoffman) seemed over the top, nearly tipping the structure all together. There was no balance. It was almost as if director Jay Roach was asking us to forget about DeNiro and Danner, and focus more on Streisand and Hoffman. We needed a stronger, more comedic balance in this family. While I do think that there was chemistry between these four players, it was never fully matched or developed. Their jokes also make for bad comedy. Have we not learned yet that bathroom humor is a thing of the past? There seemed to be more of these than the intelligent humor reached in Meet the Parents. Secondly, how many times can we hear the word 'Focker' and laugh at it. I believe that it was overused in the first film, and deeply buried in this film. If these were the two anchoring jokes for the film, we are definitely on the wrong road of comedy. Roach had a very funny film on his hands here, but strangely, he focused on repeating similar jokes from the original, ultimately lowering this film from hysterical, to humorous.I mentioned above about how the actors were not reaching to their potential, and I do believe it to be true. DeNiro seemed bland throughout this entire film. There was no surprise or inviting element to him. Ben Stiller, literally, needs to take a break for a bit. His humor seems to be slowly fading with each film that he creates. He seems to jump head-first into the big budget films, when I really think that he could make a bigger impact on the smaller, independent pictures. Hoffman's character seemed forced. I could tell that he was having fun, in fact the whole cast was having fun, but no work was getting done. Hoffman had this one-dimensional character that only seemed alive because of Streisand's wacky shenanigans. Finally, there was the muted Teri Polo, whose character was so exciting that I nearly thought that she was dropped midway through this film. Again, I cannot state this enough, there was so much potential wasted in this film that I nearly imagined new ways to make this film as the film was still playing. Hoffman and DeNiro together should have created a match in comedy heaven, but instead 'ha-ha' purgatory seemed more apt.Finally, I would like to say that nothing in this film surprised me. I kept waiting to get to the point in the movie where I would finally say, 'This is why this film was created', but it never arrived. Roach hit the potential bar, but chose not to go above it. He knew he had enough money invested in it if he continued to use repetitive jokes and situations that creativity and originality was completely thrown out the window. It was sad to witness such greats fall, but I just wish there was more to this film  not in length, but in girth. Meet the Fockers is a perfect example of Hollywood creating just to meet budgets and create revenue. It was a formidable idea, but the finished product probably never reflected this idea. I was massively disappointed.Overall, there were some chuckles from me as I watched this film, but never any laughter. From the reviews and friends who spoke so highly of this film, I was expecting to be blown away by the possibility of a comedic sequel that worked, but perhaps I was setting the bar too high. Stiller does seem tired, as did the rest of the cast except for the newbies that never quite balanced out this picture. Everyone seemed so clichéd that you could literally pick out their characters from other comedy films from across the ages. A majority of the blame I bring on Roach's shoulders, as he needed to break his normal, tired, Hollywood recycled mold of film-making. I wasn't overly impressed with this film and would probably suggest skipping it. It carries none of the power, originality, or creative genius that Meet the Parents did.Grade: *** out of *****",5,0,0,17 May 2005
Before Sunset," I'm designed to feel slightly dissatisfied!
","I will be the first to announce that I was not a huge fan of the original film. While I thought that it was interesting to see as well as an untapped concept in Hollywood, I felt that the characters were too forced coupled with a very amateurish and repetitive moments. It was an average film that seemed to be lacking bits of the human element. It needed something more. At the time I couldn't put my finger on it, but after seeing Before Sunset, I could see what it was. Maturity. This may sound strange, but I felt that Jesse and Celine were too perfect in the first film. They lacked connectiveness to the average person. I couldn't see myself in this situation. Perhaps if I would have seen the original film in 1995 instead of a couple of years ago, it would have been closer, but I just couldn't capture the moment. In Before Sunset, I feel head over feet for both Jesse and Celine.They seemed to have grown and experienced a life that was all their own. They seemed more passionate, more powerful, and especially more human. From their first meeting in the bookstore until the finale in Celine's apartment, I was fully immersed in their conversation. I wanted to know everything I could about both of them, and I did. I loved hearing about Celine's passion for the environment, and Jesse's distraught marriage. It brought these two characters out of the screen and into our lives. Whether it was a scripted story or if Hawke and Delpy were playing off each other, it worked. I witnessed in this film two people who were made for each other. It was more obvious in this film than in the prior outing. What made this film work on such a higher level than the first were the actors. They have grown and emerged as two important commodities in the Hollywood community. This is probably Hawke's greatest performance in years. His relaxed actions made us feel relaxed around him, yet quietly pushing for him to be closer to Celine. His pushy sexual advances seemed less forced and instead more like honest love. He looked and felt like a man that has been dreaming of this encounter all his life, and it finally happened. You could see the excitement in his eyes to see Delpy again. It was more than just acting, he put so much heart into this performance that it was clearly displayed for all to see. The same goes for Delpy. At the beginning of this film, I didn't like her character. She seemed rough and rigid around the edges, constantly giving off that feeling that she was harboring a secret that she didn't want Hawke to know. As her character grew in this film, I understood why. She had a different life after the encounter than Hawke did. While he still longed for Celine in his heart, he did move on. She longed for Jesse in her heart, and to this day could not find anyone to replace his purity. I loved Celine much more in the sequel because she kept us guessing. Did she remember their night together? Did she really loose her grandmother, or did she just not show up that day in Vienna? Was the song just for Jesse? So many questions left me wanting more and more and more. Finally, I would like to say that Linklater is growing with his films, and this was a crowning achievement for him. He powerfully and delicately built a sequel that was for superior than the original. He continued with a similar format as the first, but gave us stronger characters and another beautiful city. The language in this film is intense. Listen to the words that come from Ethan and Julie, they embody so much of our culture and our lives. There were moments when I felt they were speaking thoughts directly from my mind. Everything in this film was connected and worked to the fullest extent of cinematic possibility. Overall, this was a brilliant film. Linklater captured the essence of these two heart-struck people and proved that it could be filmed. This is one of the ultimate love stories that will remain on your minds far after the film is over. The intimate final lines will continually reverberate as the best ever in a movie. This was a huge step up from the original, and is one of the best films of the year. If you were not a fan of the Before Sunset, I suggest that you check this out. It is a mature film that explores the power of love in a way that no other Hollywood film could. I would not be surprised if we saw the title of this film in the Oscar celebration this year. Check out this film to hear social commentary of our lives, fall in love, and especially to see the beauty of Paris. Grade: ***** out of *****",10,298,340,20 November 2004
The Incredibles," You sly dog! You caught me monologuing!
","This was an impressive film. I have not had the best of luck with PIXAR films lately. I didn't really see the creativity in Monsters, Inc and Finding Nemo literally gave me the sweats when I watched it, so there was some hesitancy to see what PIXAR could do to topple their past mega-hits. Well, what they crafted was something so out of left field that even I, the movie kinda guy, never saw it coming. They made a very witty, intelligently clever, powerfully smart adult cartoon. While there were elements throughout the film that I felt children would enjoy, I did feel as if 92% of this film was invested with the intelligent adult in mind. There is great respect paid to the superheroes of my father's generation as well as a specific intent to downplay the 'cute' element and keep us glued to our seats with action, suspense, and some of the most ingenious animation to be seen this side of the Mississippi.From beginning to end, this film reeked perfection in a way that other films only aspire to smell like. It not only gave us this huge pre-story about what was happening in the world of superheroes (a concept that seemed taboo in the past), but it also gave us this enormous family dynamic that allowed each character to be built from the floor up. Each of our characters has their own dilemma, their own style, and their own hurdles that they need to cross, and Brad Bird gives them each their moment to shine. While he does focus heavily on our 'head of family' Mr. Incredible, he gives so much attention to detailing the rest of the characters and scenes that you never feel this uneven balance. This is a story about family, about realizing that you are 'super', and that powers are not needed to realize this. These are huge issues to cover in a animated film, but Bird succeeds in these three ways: First, he gives the film the time that it deserves. This is not some mere 89 minute film that never develops anything, never takes a chance, nor allows our characters to shine, but instead a very hefty 121 minutes of sheer pleasure. This is also why I think Bird had adults in mind while creating this visual feast, I know of very few children's films that are that extensive, normally you loose the child too quickly, but perhaps Bird wasn't aiming towards that audience. At least, that is what I witnessed.Second, Bird gives us this huge world that is not surrounded by animated boundaries. We do not stay in just one city, we do not loiter around the superhero's house all day, and we do not get pulled into normal animated clichés like the man saves the day and gets himself that woman he has always wanted. The Incredibles went in a completely new, fresh, and somewhat tangent direction that gave it the power to grow before our eyes. That is what I completely enjoyed about this film was the fact that I could not foresee the future, meaning that there were no building clichés that gave me a direct path to the end. I had to guess, consider all possibilities, and reason with new ones that were unfolding before me. It was an adventure, not just a simple piece of cinema.Third, and this is huge, was the main worry that I had with this film was the possible 'baby' moments. I was so worried that we would find ourselves wasting time watching, listening, or gasp laughing at the 'cute' baby factor. I thought that this was a path that Bird was going to travel towards, and would have ultimately caused this review to be a bit more tilted. But, this wasn't a film for a child was it? So, Bird left out most of the scenes dealing with the child and thus forced us to see the adults dealing with very mature themes and scenarios. This factor was huge in indicating that perhaps Bird had a separate audience in mind.Overall, this was an amazing film to watch, experience, and enjoy. The bold use of colors complimented the sensation of the characters that carried with them similar attributes. Brad Bird skillfully crafted this film that had every possibility of being clichéd and overbearingly geared towards children, but instead he took a higher road and gave us this film that will last the test of time due greatly in part to giving us, the adults in the world, an opportunity to indulge and enjoy the power of animated cinema. In every attempt not to sound redundant, this film was 'incredible'. The characters were beautiful, the story was solid, and the powerful voice acting allowed this film to rank among the top of my PIXAR favorites. I highly recommend this film to anyone that is an avid superhero fan or simply is looking for an adventurous ride into the future of our movie business. WOW. That is all I can say  'WOW'.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,0,1,22 March 2005
Hero," The Pen is Mightier than the Sword!
","The biggest names in Asian cinema have joined together to make this visually stunning film about revenge, love, and unity. Jet Li is Nameless, a commoner that has taught himself the power of the sword in a short span of ten years. He takes his ability and confronts three assassins that have tried to bring down the Kingdom of Qin. After these battles, he brings their swords to the King of Qin who rewards Nameless with the opportunity to sit ten feet from him and enjoy a drink. It is at this time that a second story is presented and a completely new 'hero' now sits before the King. As control bounces back and forth, it becomes apparent that these two men are the pivotal figures of a new unified country where violence is not a means to an end.Stunning. Beautiful. Dazzling. Jaw-dropping. Enticing. Emotional. These are just a couple of words that describe this visual masterpiece. It is one of those rare films that demonstrate the beauty of the sword instead of horror that it creates. As our characters whisk through the air with the weight of a feather and the power of an elephant, we are pulled into this mythically real world full of emotion and pride. We are taught that battles are not just fought for the sole purpose of killing, but rather to help eliminate injustices that have been caused. I especially loved the way that director Yimou Zhang uses music and calligraphy to show that the power of the sword comes from more than just strength. He explains through two stories that you must have a balance between you and the outside elements to master the power of the steel. Zhang then takes the music and calligraphy to the next level. Throughout this film we are shown the spirit of calligraphy while being entranced by the score of the film. It is apparent that Zhang wanted to give us more than just an action film, but also a story about his culture and world.The only trouble that I have with this film was that it was too beautiful. I find that sometimes directors get so caught up with the power of all the colors and camera work that the story sometimes gets lost or shattered in the process. This is what I think happened with this film. I loved the cinematography, but somehow couldn't get excited about the story. There were questions that I needed answered (i.e. what is Moon's true feelings for Broken Sword?) and characters that I wanted to see better developed (ie Sky). I needed to counter with a powerful story that would keep me on the edge of my seat. This was not the case with this movie. I continually thought to myself this question, 'If the amazing fight sequences were removed, would you have been captivated by the story?' My answer is 'no'. There wasn't a strong enough balance of the two to make this film powerful, instead it just allowed my eyes to enjoy a 96 minute long piece of candy.Grade: *** out of ****",Null,0,0,11 September 2004
No Man's Land," Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral.
","No Man's Land is an extremely social film about the absurdity of war and the lack of humanity that surrounds it. It takes a very recent conflict with the Bosnians and Serbs and translates it into a message that is very relevant in today's current Iraq conflict. While it begins as our normal, mundane and clichÃ© war film, it quickly changes 'when the fog lifts' and our two heroes are forced into a situation that they never chose to be in. Director Danis Tanovic uses a new trick of storytelling by eliminating the hordes of soldiers and limiting our interaction with just two people that are to represent their own country. This impressed me about this film. Each character in this film represents their own country. Nino is the Serbs, Ciki is the Bosnians, and the French officer tries to place the peacekeeping French. When you take the human away from the picture, you begin to see this as a battle between countries with a 'neutral' character standing in. It also reminded me of a boxing match. We had our two fighters whom never really became friends because they had to fight, and the referee called the UN who was there to blow the whistle if it was ever too rough. After you begin to see that we have moved from a platoon war film to a simple two-person fight (worthy of the stage) of which each symbolize their own country, the rest of this film falls into place. Well, I was hoping that it would at least. I wasn't crazy about this film. I was expecting to see a tour de Force of imagery and triumph because it was able to beat out Amelie for best picture, but sadly I think the Academy went with this film because of the message that it sent throughout the picture. As I said before, this is a very social film. It dabbles in the idea that wars are sometimes fought for the wrong reasons and for forgotten times. There is a conversation between the Serb and Bosnian near the beginning of the film that I thought was interesting. They were talking about how this war started, and neither could remember who was the aggressor and who was the pacifist. Why was this war still happening? Nobody knew, but the anger and hatred was still in full demand. They each continue fighting over who caused this accident to happen to our man under the mine. Instead of helping and trying to save him, they fight. I saw this as yet another 'jab' against war. Most of the time the soldiers are so upset that being a savior comes second nature to fighting. We can definitely see this in our current battles overseas.Another key element in this film was the lack of use in the media, and the way that the UN is portrayed. First, the role of the media in this film. While they were key in brining the UN to the site of the accident, they are not very forceful in knowing the truth. I found this to be shocking and very realistic at the same time. They got their story, they pulled their ratings out of the ground, but the need to know the truth and to be of some help was obviously lacking. This was a huge punch in the media's faces. They are portrayed as cold, heartless celebrities that use the camera as their weapon of choice. Let us not forget the UN as well. No Man's Land hugely knocks the role of the UN in this conflict. One of the quotes from this film, 'Neutrality does not exist in the face of murder. Doing nothing to stop it is, in fact, choosing. It is not being neutral' is a direct slam on to the policies of the UN. For most of these conflicts, troops are there to keep the peace, not to interfere. Therefore, the UN is asking their troops to ignore the violence, and allow the UN to be there just to say they were there. This is obviously the way that director Danis Tanovic wanted to portray the UN and it came out very clearly. It was a genuinely emotional scene that seemed to resonate from the director's heart. Overall, this was a decent film. I was expecting much more than what was present due to the fact that it beat out Amelie for best Foreign Film at the Oscars, but it carried itself well. I felt it could have been more comical and a little less politically social commentary. By the first thirty minutes of this film I could see what the director wanted to accomplish and I needed something different. I wanted to be shocked and surprised, but instead I found a half-creative film that could have pushed the envelope a bit more to allow it to reach new heights. I think you should see it once, but a second viewing is right out of the question. Instead, spend more time seeing Amelie.Grade: *** out of *****",Null,1,5,3 November 2004
Wimbledon," I'll jump! You don't want that on your conscience, do you?
","Was the purpose of this Hollywood film to see how just how many clichés they could fit into a two hour time frame? Perhaps it was just I, but I counted nearly twenty in the first hour. From the accidental meeting to the overuse of the 'good luck charm' theme, Hollywood successfully packed in these and a bunch more for this little British film. With clichés weighting down the truck of this ride, we also have two actors helming it that need more skill in the romantic comedy genre, or else they may find themselves veering off the road and down a steep hill crashing into more and more poor films. Bettany was not a substitute for the Hugh Grant style of British acting that this film desperately needed, while Kirsten Dunst is not aging well at all. Her acting seems to be depleting with her charm and looks, causing us to actually watch the tennis games in this film instead of their performances. Thankfully, we had these CGI tennis matches to watch, which was the only eye-catching element to this entire film. It covered the element that Bettany and Dunst were lacking, which was talent.So, was I too harsh with the beginning paragraph? I don't think so. What could have been a decent film with better British actors and a stronger leading lady, eventually fell apart with the nonchalant emotion of Bettany and the 'collecting my paycheck' style of acting from Dunst. Even veteran actor Sam Neill couldn't escape the clutches of cliché as he played the same father-esquire figure that we have seen time and time again in this genre of film. I hope his paycheck will go to the reconstruction of the broken nerves in his face that were unusable in this film thus giving us a reason why his character did not smile nor show any form of emotion towards his daughter or boyfriend. It was as if he was rehearsing for a role in The Stepford Wives instead of this movie. These three actors literally gave the worst performances of their career. They never broke their own mold, but simply followed the lines and direction given to them from the script. If the script itself could have done its own acting, this may have been a better film. Instead we are lead on an emotional carriage ride that has squares for wheels and seems to be lost the entire time. If I had to give a reason as to why this film was not as successful in the box office as it could have been, I would have to say it was the acting. It really slumped this film deeper into a darkened corner.If one can look past the acting, there really isn't anything else to see. Lacking the excitement from a sports film, even if it is tennis, director Richard Loncraine follows the same route as every other sports film released by Hollywood. Imagination was not a prerequisite for making this movie. From the overplayed underdog story, to the forced connection between Dunst and Bettany, to finally the unemotional ending, Loncraine gives nothing short of disaster. When these films are being produced by the dozens in Hollywood, it is your job as the director to give us something new. Either a fresh face, or a fresh course of events. Do not fall into the same clichés over and over again, as it seems that Loncraine has opted to do (referencing my comment about packing as many clichés as possible into this film).If I must note only one good thing about this film, I would have to go with the use of CGI. Apparently, the graphics department was ordered to use their imagination to give us a new perspective on the game and to freshen up the look of tennis. This was successful as I thought that the uses of CGI to capture the effects of the ball on the court were outstanding. It is an element not used often enough in sporting films, so it provided some ease to my eyes that were swollen from the rest of this picture. As I think about it, even the CGI was a bit disappointing because it proved that the actors were not actually playing the sport, thus only destroying whatever believe we had in their feeble characters. Oh well, I tried.Finally, I would like to say that I was a bit disturbed by the idea of Bettany and Dunst together. I felt that their relationship was built upon Bettany doing better at the game. She was his good luck charm. He knew that from the beginning, yet decided to stay with her to help him reach new heights of fame and fortune. He, in other words, used her. Director Richard Loncraine does a fantastic job of avoiding this issue and placing the entire emphasis on love. That is all fine and dandy, but we need reality to take into effect her and demonstrate that without Dunst, Bettany would have ultimately failed. Loncraine tries to give us some explanation at the end of the film (not to give anything away), but is unsuccessful because of the cliché surrounding it. I personally thought there was no emotion between the two love interests, only this dark addiction to being victorious that kept these two together (or at least one rushing after the other). Think about this as you watch the movie.Overall, this film was pitiful. Nothing in it was spectacular, nothing was imaginative, and nothing sparked any bit of creativity or excitement for me to pick up a tennis ball and begin playing again. Bettany and Dunst gave the worst performances of their careers as they stumbled through the emotions and lines of this film. With these two hardly showing any skill it was only a matter of time that the remaining elements followed suit.Grade: ** out of *****",2,4,9,11 January 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," The infection is spreading faster than anyone could have anticipated.
","I have to admit I loved the first film. It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied. Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events. There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality. I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel. As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood. Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place. More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story. A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, clichéd characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original. I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation. I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood cliché instead. The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse. His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top). Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first. There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall). This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series. Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film. Yet again, who am I to say? Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end. It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clichés to pour in like the flood gates had been opened. The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present. The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold. The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever. Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas. YUK. Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing. Not just the characters were cliché, but also the story. Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI. Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load. Seriously, I would love to know what happened.I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen. For any of you that did not, I question your sanity. The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut. It was sloppy and cheap. Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series. The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad. Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless. I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept. Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.Grade: ** out of *****",3,1,5,13 January 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Great Reason to Stay Home and Explore Space
","'2001' is a pioneer of science fiction film-making, which inspired a new generation and gave audiences more than just cheap effects with little green men. Kubrick created a film that makes you think, not just about what is happening on the screen, but also what the future holds. In 1968, 2001 seemed like a million years away, and this is what Kubrick thought we would look like  now, in 2008, if he were alive  he could make a film called '2012: A Space Odyssey' and this critic would believe his view of the distant future. Kubrick opens our film with the power of sound. Like an opera beginning its set, we are left in the dark as our musicians begin their concertos that fill our ears with emotion and the unknown. Beginning in this way, it takes us (in a positive way) out of the feeling of the film, and that we are sitting in the best seats of the house for a performance of the theater of the absurd. With words reminiscent of Beckett, Kubrick brings both a voice and a sound to this film that is difficult to find in today's modern science fiction films. A modern similarity would be the independent film 'Primer', but even that is a long shot. What makes '2001' more than just a film is the classical music Kubrick uses. As the film progresses, it feels as if the music was made with this film in mind. The 'dawn of man' with the booming overture as our ape ancestors claw at the monolith will, and has, remained a staple in the cinematic world. With this sheet of black metal, Kubrick created a sound and an image that could never be duplicated  while some have tried  the emotion and feeling when the Sun and Earth crest the monolith on Mars can never be reproduced. With a minimal script, language used as a secondary way to complete the story, the sound needed to be perfect  and the full bodied orchestra did better than perfect. It created a sound for a place that is devoid of everything except darkness  space.With my ogling of sound complete, there were other elements of '2001' that were equally sharp and powerful. By dating a film there is always the risk of arriving to that date without finding any of the predictions true, the film becomes a cultural hick-up and forgotten in the canyons of cinema. What makes Kubrick's film impeccable is its ability to grow outside of the normality of average science fiction. While it holds a date of 2001, it does not mean that the Kubrick's themes become dated. This is difficult to explain, but watching '2001' in 2008 still was impressive. The technological advances, the exploration of the unknown, the questionable ethics of evolution still resonates in today's society and I feel that Kubrick knew this while making this film. Sure, this was his idea (or perhaps Clarke's idea) of the future, but it is still the future. By book marking it with the unspoken birth of humanity and with the rebirth of the 'Space Child'  it transcends the 2001-esquire moments. What makes this film go beyond the 2001 pitfall is that rarely is it mentioned the actual date. Outside of the title sequence and the brief moment with HAL, this film could be placed anywhere  and it does. Do not be fooled by the title, this is still a relevant film today as it was yesterday and through the years to come.One still cannot speak about this film without talking about HAL and that infamous line about the 'pod bay doors'. It has become more than just cultural chatter, but wine-chatter with film snobs. It is an important and provocative moment of the film, but the events surrounding it contain just as much recognition. In one fell swoop, HAL changes and the dawn of man becomes a page in the history books. The machines have become smarter than their creators, and a new dawn has arrived. Kubrick's scenes surrounding HAL were phenomenally spooky. That looming yellow eye stayed with me long after the film and can be still seen in current cinematic releases. With one fell swoop of the camera, Kubrick created man, developed the monolith, brought fear into technology, and then attempted to explain the meaning of life. Overall, this film has impressed me completely. The Homer-esquire journey that we, the viewer, take on this film is unparalleled in any other cinematic adventure. No other director could have helmed this project as well as given the darkness, the fear, the hope, and the overall sense of excitement to the screen. Kubrick was a film pioneer, his voice can continue to be heard today with any science fiction film that is released, and it is all due to this one singular film that chose to open with darkness and the score of an opera, and end with the eyes of a child. This is a science fiction film, but it is more than that. This is a history book. It is a page of our life that nobody wants to see. The monolith could represent anything, and there are film classes that spend years discussing it  and that is why this movie will remain firmly rooted in our catalog. I loved the sounds, I loved the technology, I loved the dark vacuum of space, but most importantly, I loved the unknown. This was not a linear story that one could watch and forget about  out of respect to Kubrick  watch this film, watch it again  point out the unknown and keep it fresh in your friend's mind. This is a glowing example of why films are made.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,2,6,10 May 2008
Saw," Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
","While I will admit, with several other critics, that the acting was not great, I must resort to a comment that I made in my Grudge comment. I did not come into this film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting. I came into this film expecting to be impressed with a story that I hadn't seen and some imagery that would resonate throughout my mind long after the film was over. Saw successfully accomplished this task. While I will admit that it is nowhere close to toppling the popular Se7en, it did stand on its own two fee and provide some interesting thoughts about life and the choices we must make when placed into life-challenging moments. It was classy in the way that it presented the story, staying away from the pitfall of being too gory, it instead placed more emphasis on simplicity and raw human emotions. What impressed me about Saw is that it revamped the age-old Hollywood formula for these types of films. That is what ultimately made this ending so difficult to decode. I thought I knew exactly what was happening up until the final key moments when my mind shattered and the wildly implausible became a reality. That is what pushed this film from your average 'serial killer' film to a wickedly delightful noir-styled thriller.I continue reading more reviews about the acting in this film and how under par it was. I would like to quickly mention that you are working with two of the teetering 'B' to 'C' grade actors of our generation. Cary Elwes and Danny Glover could be classified as 80s superstars, but as the years passed they found themselves with less and less work, thus fading their acting ability. After the Lethal Weapon films, I am not sure I have seen Glover in anything worth writing home about, while Elwes can be said that his career went down after Robin Hood: Men in Tights. So, you are not dealing with the crème de la crème of Hollywood, but instead two actors who read a story that was original and chilling at the same time and chose to jump onto the project for sheer enjoyment. While their acting is not outstanding, their effort and overall feeling of excitement cannot be matched. You can watch huge blockbuster films and think to yourself that the $20 million dollar actors are just doing it to sustain the lifestyle that they have and ultimately their performances don't seem to reach their pay scale, then you can watch these smaller, limited budget films like Saw, and appreciate the work that the actors are doing. I guess what I am trying to say is that I agree with the critics out there that the acting wasn't great, but there was excitement and appreciation for their roles, and I have to give them credit for that.Outside of the acting, this film impressed me. The originality of the story shocked me. I thought it was going to be this unoriginal butcher/killer film, but instead it turned into this deeply thematic film about the values that we place on our lives as humans. Without giving anything away, you have to appreciate what this supposed 'killer' is doing to his victims. The killer is opening the eyes of those that have taken their life and literally thrown it out the window. While I do not think that it was done in the most appropriate way, this film did allow your mind to open. Just like in Se7en when our killer is talking to Pitt and Freeman in the back of the police car, the words and ideas that are created will remain with you for a very long time. Saw was a very intelligent film that coupled gruesome scenes of violence with the apathy of human existence. To me, it worked.I am also extremely passionate about films that allow you to discuss the possibilities of the ending, middle, or even the beginning. Any film that evokes conversation the moment is has finished, in my book, has done a great job. Now, if the conversation is continually about the negative aspects of the film, then it succeeded in making a bad film, if the conversation is about the great moments, the endless possibilities, and the deeply rooted themes that pertain to life in general, than the film was successful in being good. I despise those films that just shoot for the middle of the road, forcing you to walk away from the film or theater just not caring that you just spent your hard-earned money and time into the film. Those films are a waste in my book. Saw had, actually, still has me thinking about the different possibilities of the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I finished the film thinking  wow, but what does this mean? How did this happen? Where are we going from here? Yada yada yada  (did I just yada yada yada Saw?) I could have watched it a second time back to back just to find points that I missed. Any film that makes it exciting and interactive deserves some respect in my book  and Saw earned it.Overall, I thought this was a much better film that I was expecting. The deeply rooted themes of human life and our choices to praise what is handed before us are strong and not often argued in film. While the acting was about average, I did not walk into this film expecting to be blown away by performances, it was the bigger picture that I was more excited about. Saw worked well as a whole, from the acting to the story, all the pieces put together brought a very enjoyable movie to the table, but if you look at them separately, you will not find the enjoyment, just random bits of chaos.Grade: **** out of *****",9,0,0,8 April 2005
National Treasure," Are we there yet? I'm hungry. This car smells weird.
","National Treasure was a failure as a film. While the monetary figures will not support this comment, I will say that upon viewing this film, it is nothing but accurate. From the clichéd story, to the cheap acting, to even the simplistic 'clues' National Treasure proved that if you have a big named actor in the lead, some pre-high school history, and a powerhouse producer (and the big Pirates of the Caribbean passion) that you could literally sell a screen door on a submarine. What was the excitement behind this film? Why is there still a waiting list at my video store for this title? There was nothing of value from the beginning to end of this film that would ever cause the hysteria that I have seen so far. Nicolas Cage proves to the world that he is the male version of Marisa Tomei (questioning his choices after his deserved Oscar win), and that he has the ability to run, jump, and reason with the greatest of speed. Acting wasn't necessarily needed, just the ability to look smarter than one truly is.With my questions posed as to how the success of this film became a part of American cinema, I thought back to this film. The acting was atrocious. Nic Cage looked and acted just like a mannequin throughout this entire film. There was no range of emotion or excitement in anyway. His romantic involvement with Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) was like watching two complete strangers try to build a passionate relationship in ten minutes. It was awkward, cheesy, and embarrassing for all those involved. Even the acting from the 'comic relief' of the film, Cage's sidekick Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) seemed forced. His jokes didn't make me laugh once, but instead made me feel uneasy and cheated out of some hard earned cash plopped down for this film. To have a successful 'action-adventure' film, you must have it firmly stapled with some decent acting. If big stars are only going to water down your film (as in the case of National Treasure), then you must find smaller stars and build upon the story. These are simple rules, which nobody in this production followed.With no acting in place, I was forced to watch the story unfold before my eyes. Actually, the story felt like a crumpled piece of paper thrown at me. There was no direction, no points for me to follow, but instead haphazard movement by our actors and director to keep the flow of the film in motion instead of becoming stale. Sadly, they were unable to do this. From the opening 'clue' to the final one, there was little to no explanation as to why nobody else had found this treasure, or how local historians had never found the hidden artifacts scattered around hugely populated areas. I would understand if we were searching cornfields, but we were in metropolises and nobody discovered these clues until today. It was just rather unbelievable to me. I felt like this story was yelling at me. Violently forcing me to follow each clue without explanation, but out of sheer hope that something bigger would happen. I work better when there is some moment of 'why' thrown into the mix. A moment that allows the viewers to think for themselves instead of being treated like children. After viewing this film, that was how I felt. I felt like I couldn't make my own decisions, but instead the power of Bruckheimer was forcing me to think in one way, and one way only. It hurt this film and upset me until the final credits arrived.Finally, I would like to say (because I am sure that most are upset with my dislike of this film) that another point that hurt this film was the lack of action. This movie is labeled as the next Indiana Jones, but if you grew up with the stories of Lucas and Spielberg, you will remember that they were action based. There were moments of realization, but there was much more action involved. I think more action incorporated into the National Treasure story would have helped it survive a bit longer than what it did. I wanted to see some traps set forth by our founding fathers, some ancient guards, or anything that would have lifted the lifeless plot that surrounded this film. My mother said that it just needed better bad guys, and I couldn't agree more. There wasn't that fire in Bean's eyes that you were accustomed to seeing in the Indy films. Nobody was tied up, nobody had a whip, and nobody was trying. Bruckheimer, you literally need to stop.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this Hollywood 'hit'. While most will argue that they thought it was the most impressive film they have seen in a long time (words that I have heard time and time again), I just thought that it never went to the next level. The cliché acting hurt this film dearly, while the story just never reached up and grabbed me. I never felt like Turtletaub (ummmmmm....Turtletaub) quite knew what he was getting himself into. He needed a stronger balance between action and adventure, and needed to allow us to make our own decisions instead of forcing his thoughts into our face. This film was a complete disrespect to our history, and I denounce it forever! Grade: * out of *****",1,24,51,25 May 2005
The Fountain," Aronofsky's Homage to Kubrick's '2001' with a twist of LOVE
","Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story. In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well 'Van Helsing' himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic. Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer. His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering. He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way. Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand. There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined. Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together. From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project. This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced. From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be 'cute', but instead determined and sad at the same time. We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh. Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters. This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's '2001'  perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that. This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress. From 'Pi' I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of 'Requiem for a Dream', he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo. Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story. This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe. His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive. He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment. It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different  the same message was being sent. His attention to detail was magnificent. I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear. This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life. To me, that is what transformed 'The Fountain' from your average sci-fi experience to something larger. Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created. This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty. Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect. The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story. The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments. Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly. The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi. Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden. They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of 'The Fountain'. While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.Overall, 'The Fountain' was a fresh new film experience for me. With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases. As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable. This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time  it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout. This is not a film for all, but many should experience it. The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet. This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher. It took you all over the map without pity or remorse. 'The Fountain' was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project. Aronofsky continues to impress with his films. They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year. 'The Fountain' should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended. This is one of my favorites of the year.Grade: ***** out of *****",8,2,5,12 June 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls
","For many, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is a staple to their holiday traditions. With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday. As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago. It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers. For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again. As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; 'It's A Wonderful Life' transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business. With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself. I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams 'Merry Christmas' throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy. The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place. This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing  giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him  but also a glimpse of a world without small business 'It's A Wonderful Life', the film itself, is beautifully crafted. With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image. Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls. Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town. Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave  and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own. Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting. Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism. His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes. When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him  we scream with him. This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters  we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles  and they do. One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received. His enormous sets, the birth of a new 'snow', and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe. What I enjoy about 'It's A Wonderful Life' is that Capra tricks you by the end. Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time. One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film  since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets. Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural. Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.Overall, 'It's A Wonderful Life' remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home. The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world. Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values. The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer  the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back. Dreams are traded for jobs  communities are strengthened by friendships. This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls. The science fiction element to this film, yep  that is what I am considering it  comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout. Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes? Brilliant! While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film. Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever. Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever. It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,2,6,22 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wait a minute, how'd this happen? We're smarter than this!
","Did I like this film? Growing up in the 80s, I remember the passion and intense love that I had for the original Star Wars films. I remember being able to watch them everyday, all day, and never growing tired of the story, the characters, or the beautiful imagery. Sadly, I cannot say the same about these newer episodes. They have been created for a different generation than mine. A generation that would rather see bold explosions, intense fighting, and stunning CGI over a powerful story and decent acting any day. It is sad, because while Revenge of the Sith did answer some of the questions that I always wondered with the original three films, it did fall prey to this change of dynamic. Lucas is a brilliant storyteller. He has redefined and rebirthed the science fiction genre into ways that I will always be grateful, but his inability to control his actors, to have them work for him instead of fight him, have plagued these newer three chapters. Here you have these intense action sequences in which Lucas' eye has perfected, but then you have these moments where our central characters are all stuck in a paper bag, unable to free themselves with acting. It is pathetic, and I do believe it is what has placed these final three chapters behind the original.The story dynamics of this film had changed as well. In the original, there was a sense of far, far, away lands and ferocious creatures lurking around each corner, but in these newer chapters, I felt confined and looking at only familiar beasts. But, I do not want to dwell entirely on the comparisons between the new and old, while it does influence this review and sensation of the film, it is not what made me so neutral about the Revenge of the Sith. The story dynamics was a big element that I felt was missing from this film. New worlds, the vast depth of the Republic seemed to be absent. I wanted to see how the other worlds were reacting to the dark change, but all I saw was how Anakin, Obi-Wan, and the glowingly weak Yoda reacted. I wanted to see the ripple of effect throughout the planets, but instead we were forced to see how dumbfounded the illustrious Jedi didn't see this sinister move coming.This leads me to my second point. The power of the Jedi. I realize that Lucas wanted to show the birth of the Dark Lord, but it felt like he really dumbed down the power of the Jedi. For those that will argue that the 'Dark Side' was too powerful, I just don't buy it. With the power of modern technology that was so boasted throughout the film, the Jedi overused their powers of procrastination to wait until the final moments to realize that something bad was going to happen. This was embarrassing, and while I normally rejoice when good succumbs to evil in films, I do not get happy when they allow evil to win by default. It was embarrassing and pointless.There is no doubt in my mind that Lucas' vision cannot be matched in Hollywood. From the intense CGI battles to the impressive worlds (the small handful) that he takes us to, Lucas proves that he can be imaginative and color coordinated. Though when it comes to directing and storytelling, he seems to be lacking in both categories. This was a beautiful film, but the story left so much to be desired. I wish that Lucas had done to this series what Harry Potter has done with its film adaptations  a new director for each film. I would have liked to see different storytellers use Lucas' technology to bring the true darkness into the final chapter. Imagine David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, Alfonso Cuarón, or even Christopher Nolan dipping their hands into this story. Imagine the dark shadows that would have truly been cast. I believe that with this change the power of the 'Dark Side' would have been the evil cloud that I so wanted, instead of this cartoonish escapade that Lucas created.Overall, I thought that this was an average film. From the beginning of these new films (Episodes I, II, and III), I just haven't been jumping up and down. I don't know if it is because of my religious dedication to the original films or just the lack of story with these new ones that was so relevant in the original, but I haven't been overjoyed. The actors seemed like they were playing for the paycheck and notoriety. Nobody, except for the CGI created Yoda, seemed excited about being involved with this production. The originality was devastating, especially near the end where the birth of darkness comes out yelling 'Nooooooo', but strangely sounds more like 'Kaaaahhhhhnnnnnnnn'. All I wanted was a dark finale to a great vision, but instead I witnessed a cartoonish ending with terrible acting, which proved to be mostly 'armless'. HA! Go back to The Empire Strikes Back if you are looking for the darker chapter to this overpowering series.Grade: *** out of *****",6,1,4,17 June 2005
The Terminal," One man, two women; crowded.
","What was the reason for Spielberg to make this film? Was it to showcase how well he works with Tom Hanks? Or was it because he wanted to force audiences into a theater (or Video Store) to pay to watch him sell out and build a very forced film? I would have to go with a combination of the two.Now, I will say that Spielberg's eye is one of the best in the industry. He continually raises the bar for each film that he makes (see Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan), but for some odd reason with The Terminal it feels like he didn't even have a bar he was trying to reach. The forced feeling of everything that happens around Tom Hanks from the unlit flame of Catherine Zeta-Jones, to a fallible in-flight wedding, to even the corny climax when a character decides to play chicken with the plane, it doesn't seem to work. Even Hanks' accent is poor. It felt as if I was watching Spielberg's table scraps from other films fall down on the floor and get gobbled up by the projector. This film just didn't work. There was not one scene in this film that I can say I enjoyed. Let me explain.Hanks was Hanks. What more can we expect from him. I do not believe he did anything above and beyond his normal call of duty in this film. I never felt like I saw Viktor in Hanks. All I could see was Hanks with a terrible accent. Whether learned or created, the words that came out of Hanks' mouth seemed like rubbish. It felt more like audience-cute instead of a definite control of the words. Perhaps it was just me, but it felt as if Hanks learned English exceptionally fast. Strange, but this was a huge plot-hole that Spielberg left wide open for us to fall into. Outside of Hanks (being Hanks), there was Zeta-Jones who chose to go with the 'bimbo' slant with her character. She seemed ditzy, dull, and completely unfocused in this film. Her chemistry with Tom Hanks seemed completely plastic and created. There was nothing between them that said to me that they were a match made in heaven. While others will argue that Spielberg had them in the film to show two sides of living in an airport (the literal and the figurative), I thought that it was a cheap shot to guide in female viewers. What a better way to do so than with a forced romance. It makes me laugh just typing about it. Second, was Tucci even a villain? Along the same lines as my Zeta-Jones comment, there was not enough character or structure for me to even believe Tucci as a bad airport director. One moment he is asking Viktor for help and another time is yelling at him. These two characters had about as much consistency as oatmeal. Oddly, this was the general feeling of this film.Outside of the characters, the major flaw in this film is the story. By the second hour of the film we have lost all hope in our characters and fearless director that we don't care what happens to anyone. Viktor's dramatic conclusion is overshadowed by the two hours of garbage that had been slowly piling up. I couldn't get excited or care what was going to happen next in this film, and that is a sign that something is doomed. I continued to get a sense of claustrophobia, wondering if Spielberg would finally take Hanks out of the airport and build upon something new and fresh. Alas, that never happened. Instead, we are forced to repeat the same steps over and over again in a way that almost makes you nauseated. Did Spielberg have a goal or vision with this film, or was it just made up along the way? Also, was his editor on vacation? I realize that his epics are normally long, but this one just seemed to drag beyond belief. I needed something, actually anything to keep my attention in this film, and yet nothing arrived. It felt like opening that Christmas present that you think is what you really want, but instead it is just socks. Boy, don't you feel let down?Overall, I was highly disappointed with this film. When I see a Spielberg film I expect to be blown away by sharp images, infallible characters, and a compassionate story. He has built so much notoriety on his name and style of film alone that there is a certain expectation when going to see one of his films. I do not feel it is bad to request these three elements in his pictures. Sadly, in The Terminal I saw nothing of the sort. It was as if Spielberg was attempting to just create a big cliché instead of a film. It was as if he was doing the complete opposite from what he normally does. In this film he had shoddy images, underdeveloped and lost characters, and a repetitive repulsive story. I do not recommend this film for anyone that is a fan of Spielberg's work. It will only bring a tear to your eye.Grade: ** out of *****",Null,10,17,29 November 2004
Halloween," ...but you cannot kill the boogeyman!!!
","I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the 'clown' mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?

Raging Bull," Criterion Spine #120 ... on Laserdisc!!!
","'Raging Bull' is aggravating to watch. As an enormous fan of Scorsese's pre-2000 work, the catalogue of innovative, dark, gripping, and overall classic works that he did seem to be given the most praise, yet the least rewards. Knowing that DeNiro won an Oscar for this film, knowing that Pesci was nominated (but lost) and knowing that Scorsese was also up for one of those prized trophies, yet lost – is extremely aggravating. Martin Scorsese is one of the most influential directors of my time, and probably my parent's time as well. His body of work ranges from angry Taxi Drive, to a suspicious boxer, to a documentary about a Band, and even a comedy about New York after hours. The list could go on, yet modern audiences only remember him as the guy that brought us 'Gangs of New York' or 'The Departed', two decent films, but nothing of the caliber that his work from the early 70s had. How can anyone say that 'The Departed' was more of an Oscar contender than 'Mean Streets'? So, upon watching 'Raging Bull' for the first time – I was filled with anger and frustration. 'Raging Bull' is one of those near perfect films that was released in the 80s, yet still seems powerful and relevant today. Perhaps it is the skill of Scorsese behind the camera to give us a non-linear biography of a man who has no trouble destroying his own life. Perhaps it is the sharp editing that takes, what could have been your average sports movie, and transforms it into this pioneering black and white, quick cut by quick cut, journey into the darkness of man. Or perhaps it is the actors, Pesci and DeNiro doing what was genius at the time (Pesci seems to have never let go of Joey La Motta in any of his future roles), and giving us lines, words, and actions that will remain in our minds long after the film is over? Perhaps. Everything about 'Raging Bull' was perfect, yet the Academy turned away for 'Ordinary People', thus Scorsese had to wait for the sympathy win to finally claim his victory. Anyone else find that aggravating? Enough of me on my soap box trying to justify why Scorsese was robbed early in life, and let's talk about what made 'Raging Bull' so exciting to watch. To begin, the casting of both DeNiro and Pesci was brilliant. The two of them had this chemistry (which would try to be duplicated again and again in 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino') which Scorsese could not have imagined. They brought to the screen a true presence of two brothers growing up in New York in the 40s, trying to cope with both fame and possible infidelity. There are points in this film where one has to question the sanity of DeNiro's La Motta and also be amazed by the way Pesci is able to keep up with DeNiro's rage. The two of them are the glue to this film. Their scenes are intense, yet delicate. They command the scene, yet give more of their character to you than most of today's actors. Then, like a pioneer in his trade, DeNiro does this amazing transformation from a guy hoping to make weight to a man gaining to demonstrate his downward spiral. It was like watching Bickle shave his head – you just cannot find determined actors like this in modern cinema.To add to the amazing caliber of acting that Pesci and DeNiro commanded, 'Raging Bull' demonstrated that Scorsese was a force to be reckoned with. Not only did he take the idea of a sports story and spin it on its head, but he also redefined the genre. Black and white cinematography, the slow-motion shots, the use of violence and language set in the 40s, and these brilliant moments where words make all the difference. One cannot watch a Spike Lee Joint today without seeing how Scorsese influenced them – his work, especially in 'Raging Bull' can be seen through today's cinema releases. While my only argument with this film is the length of the picture versus the slowed scenes, I don't fault Scorsese for that. Schrader and Martin's screenplay wasn't perfect, but thankfully with DeNiro, Pesci, and Scorsese at the helm, the fuzzy edges were able to be cleared up.I cannot say how influential this film was watching it for the first time. It is dark, it is depressing, yet the bold color of the characters – despite the black and white – come through stronger than other films watched this year. The acting is more than Oscar-worthy, they define this film and the early 80s era. My favorite scene was the shots of when La Motta was actually happy with his family – the shots filmed in color allowed us to see these characters as more than just celluloid imprints; they became real. My favorite sound – the flashbulbs going off during each match – this was just brilliant. Scorsese took an already iconic image and showed how his keen perception was able to make it better.I cannot wait to watch this film again.BRAVO SCORSESE, BRAVO!

Before Sunrise," Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?
","I would like to stress again that the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy was near to nothing. I saw no sparks, no interest, and no bond. It was as if Hawke hated everything that Delpy did (see the poet and the fortuneteller), while Delpy just was looking for an American man to spend the day with. I felt as if she was trying to create that special moment from nothing, as if it was her goal for the entire evening with Hawke. She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more 'real') that only made Delpy seem disgusted. I just felt that when these two did kiss, they didn't really enjoy it as much as they should have. As I think about this point, I can't help but think of a line that Celine uses in this film. She states, 'No, then it sounds like a male fantasy. Meet a French girl on the train, have her, and never see her again.' What if this was reversed on Celine, perhaps she was trying to find a man on a train, have him, then never sees him again. When I first met these characters, that was my initial thought. I did not see them together for the long haul, but after they talked for an hour and a half, I guess they had to fall in love. This was a totally mismatched pair by director Richard Linklater, and when you only have two main focuses in the film, I would have to say that should be your only job  ensuring that you have two people that actually build chemistry on the scene. Hawke and Delpy did not.Speaking of Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock), I do not think that he had a good grasp of this film from the beginning. I think he was attempting to show, without too much of a script, if two people could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train. What would be the 'real' reactions, and how would it ultimately end? Sorry to say that Linklater does a poor job with this film, especially the ending where it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. That was not helping him at all by having this slow ending.I have heard people quote this film as the 'greatest love story' ever. I would have to differ with them because of the characterization and portrayal of our Jesse and Celine. Both were uncomfortable, unstructured, and fractured in their parts and it was obvious through the screen. I have seen better love stories, and better stories will continue to be released!Grade: ** out of *****",4,7,23,18 February 2005
Hart's War," Wet Willis' for Everyone!
","Welcome to a new style of reviews. For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring. Today marks a day of change. I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing. Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans  but for me, it is still all about the cinema.War, really people, what is it good for? Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film 'Hart's War', absolutely nothing  do you need me to say it again? To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany. No brutality, no murder, no starvation  just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other. Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his 'luxury' suite. He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.Did I hint towards 'The Great Escape'  please don't think the same thoughts with this film. What makes 'Hart's War' a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers. It comes in the form of Terrance Howard. One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way  but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films. It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest. Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, 'You can't handle the truth', and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.How bland.'Hart's War' fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time. Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape. It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film. Willis is Willis. If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film. Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp. I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp. Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans? Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, 'oh brother!'. The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen. It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions. It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls. For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film. While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum. This is strange, because I loved 'Fallen' so very much. 'Hart's War' did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.So, again my friends, I must ask  what is war good for? To my reply  absolutely nothing.I cannot suggest this film to friends or family. Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give 'Hart's War' a(wait for it ) BLAH!",4,2,5,7 March 2007
The Great Escape," Out you escapees go, through the door or out the window...
","'The Great Escape' works for two reasons; these are two elements that have been argued time and time again, only to come up for air once in a blue moon. This film works, and nearly demands repeat viewings, because director John Sturges has complete and utter confidence in his actors, and secondly, it works because the script is kept so simple that the final act seems to come from nowhere. It is the classic bait-and-switch routine pulled off with such grace and delicacy, that I nearly missed it myself. Sturges makes this feature work because of his cast, his star-studded cast that is bigger than belief, yet so grounded, one would think that this was everyone's first feature. Amazingly, in one film, one can witness the emotion of Charles Bronson, the loyalty of James Garner, the leadership of Richard Attenborough, the fear of Donald Pleasence, the cunning of James Coburn, and finally the patriotism of Steve McQueen. Let me say this again, in ONE film, you can see all of this  and so much more. Not only do you see these great qualities come out with full force, but each actor works with each other to build a comradery, to make this film work  there is no stress for screen time, they all are eager to make cinematic magic  and it shows. One could speak for hours about this cast; it is half of what makes this film work. It is the cast that keeps you glued to your screen. It is the cast that makes you want to view the next minute of the film. It is the cast that holds this film together  but there is another big part  the script.'The Great Escape' works on the next level because Sturges realizes the simplicity of the script, and he does not let that, well, escape. This film easily could have been a convoluted story about escapees trying to elude Nazis, perhaps a love story mixed in, and that cliché element of a inside man. All of these elements could have been mixed in, but Sturges knew that he had strong enough actors that the audience would have no issues following them till the end. The story is kept simple, because it is the endurance of these men that was meant to shine, not the eruption of cliché events on screen. This 1962 film hit it square on the head, modern cinema cannot seem to grasp the idea that less will create more  and Sturges saw that with 'The Great Escape'. Even with a nearly three hour film, it kept my attention throughout because of these two very simple ideas. Strong cast  simple story.There is nothing negative about this film that I could see. The idea that the Nazis were just there as roadblocks for our escapees was intriguing because typically they are more involved. Thinking of the modern film 'Hart's War', which Ferrell and Willis work together to escape a similar situation, we have so many stories of race, trust, and fear working against the story that it turns into a huge blockbuster of a film filled with cliché over cliché, merely to turn a profit. While there are big names broadcasting in this film, it doesn't work like 'The Great Escape' because the tones are too dark, the themes seem misleading, and our actors fight, literally fight, for screen time that it all becomes muddled and incohesive. In Sturges film, the light shone during the day, our actors never were hurt, and being thrown in solitary seemed like a fly in the pan. Sturges sense of brevity should not be dismissed, while there was a lacking sense of realism throughout this film, it was forgettable. This is rare for me while watching films, because as this was a non-fiction story, there is a level of realism needed to fully submerge into the film  but Sturges does something spectacular  he gives us such great characters, deeply involved within this simple story, that the apathetic Nazis seemed genuine. 'The Great Escape' is a flawless film. There are others that could dissect this film bit by bit, but for me, it was nearly three hours of pure entertainment.Overall, I was quite impressed with this big-budget film with big-named stars and the biggest escape known to man. As we move into the summer of blockbuster films, where stars all vie for the top weekend spot, hurdling over others and expectations falling short, this old 1960s film (if re-released today) could rival those like 'Hancock', 'Indiana Jones' and even 'Dark Knight'. 'The Great Escape' proved that if you have a strong cast, develop a simple story  allowing your characters to create their own moments, and just have fun with the material handed to, than you will have on your hands an instant classic. Modern films over the years continue to borrow or re-imagine scenes from this film, and that is the highest form of flattery, but it is also a sign that Hollywood has found moments that work, and will do anything in their power to recreate. Aside from the Hollywood recycling bin argument, 'The Great Escape' has an amazing ensemble cast which could rival that of 'Oceans 11', and the nearly three hours breeze by with the greatest of ease. Again, it is a flawless film. It was a surprise for this first time viewer, and I cannot wait to introduce this feature to others who may have allowed it to fall through the cracks. Sturges has created Hollywood perfection. Watch this movie.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,0,3,1 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A Return to Innocence
","Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously 'Star Wars', but when you put them together, in this order, the words 'Empire Strikes Back' will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, 'I can give it a try'  we all know, by heart, what will follow next.'The Empire Strikes Back' is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine  get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. 'Empire Strikes Back' gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, 'Empire Strikes Back' could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in 'Return of the Jedi', and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, 'Empire' stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous 'Who shot J.R.?' moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; 'Star Wars' is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the 'new' chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form. Without sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,3,6,18 March 2008
A Walk to Remember," A Walk through the Spiritual Woods sans Bill Bryson
","Is love an instantaneous combustion? Can two nobodies, living at opposite ends of the social Earth, suddenly fall in love, change their lives, and live a happy co-existence together (well, not forever in this movie  but you get my drift)? This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery  this time it was called 'A Walk to Remember'. An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, cliché bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore). As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together. Sparks fly? Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally  through Hollywood magic fall in love. What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments. As I mentioned in my review for 'The Notebook', one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale. I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before. With 'A Walk to Remember', I was not impressed or surprised. Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films. There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom. Gasp! Did he say that? Yep, I was bored with this film. The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen. Alas, nothing  I repeat  nothing of the sort occurred. From the cliché play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, 'A Walk to Remember' proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab. Why is this? Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)? Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry? Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks. It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention. Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this 'gig' mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role. I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting. The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film. I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss  as only you could find in Sparks' story. He fit the mold of what this film represented. He was a father  one that nearly anyone could relate to. There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish 'popular' behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe. How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier? While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad. I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet. Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut  language and nudity  to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film. Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a 'religious' film, but instead, a film about faith. I didn't see that. Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought. Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind. I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship -- 'A Walk to Remember' could be the result.Grade: ** out of *****",5,1,2,24 March 2007
Sin City," Worth going to hell for. Amen.
","I will say this once, and preach it until the day that I die, but if Criterion does not pick up this title, I may  just maybe  loose faith in their choice of films. This was, hands down, one of the most stylish and innovative films to come out of Hollywood to date. The graphic mind of Frank Miller with the candy-violence ways of Rodriguez coupled together created an undeniable force of creativity and passion that continually lack in the over-budgeted Hollywood films. I have read several reviews that boast the cinematography of this film as being way before its time (thus the apparent lack of support at the box office), but while I did think the way that Rodriguez filmed this movie was outstanding, I thought that it was more than just a visual treat. Everyone in this film seemed to be giving more than what I bargained for. From the direction, to the actors, to even the darkened themes that resonated loudly throughout the film, Sin City was perfection to they eye, but also in every other critiquing category.What captivated me more than the visual eye-candy was the overall story of Sin City. Rodriguez and Miller both chose to keep the original narrative from the graphic novels to help tell the story that they had filmed. Not only did it help us get from point 'A' to point 'B' of the story, but it also helped us learn about the characters without the indecent flashback or long speeches. I learned more about the inside of Marv's mind through the battles that he was having with himself than with any other technique that could have been used. I think that brings me to another reason this film worked on more levels than anticipated, because I knew the characters. This is a character driven story. While they to commit graphic scenes of violence, it is the characters that literally steal the show. I can only think of a handful of films (mostly Wes Anderson movies) where I felt like the characters were the central focus, not explosions or sex. While these things surrounded our characters, it was the characters (the strength of the actors) that kept my eyes on the screen.Continuing with the story, one cannot help but be impressed with the consistency in Miller's stories. The overall themes of each of the stories, while told in different voices and situations were all the same. The theme of love, lust, and revenge seemed to follow all of our characters around the city and surprisingly, it worked. I was never more impressed to see the same themes reworked over and over. Love is huge in this film. Each character has a passion, or a love for someone else, which drives them to the brink of madness. With each character's love followed a moment of revenge. If you look at all three stories, the main narrators are fighting for someone that they love to bring justice to those that did this one person wrong. 'Revenge is a dish best served cold,' they say, but in the case of Miller's pen, he serves it hot and heavy. Finally, there is a moment of truth with each of the stories. I didn't realize this until I had spent several days thinking about this film, but in each of Miller's stories we are not shown the full truth. It is a one sided story where we see the action through the eyes of the main narrator. We are only shown one truth, instead of jumping back and forth between good and evil. I really liked this because it created a sense of distrust in Sin City. Were the guys that we were cheering for really the 'good' in the equation, or were they just all elements that created the chaos known as Sin City? Marv's story in particular exemplifies this idea. His blurred vision of reality resonated through me as the film continued to the other stories, and made me question several of the 'endings'. Think about this when you see it again (and possibly again and again) because remember, the title of this film is Sin City, those that reside in it are not always the 'good' in the 'good vs. evil' equation.Finally (and I know I have mentioned it already above, but I want to honestly put it aside from everything else), I would like to recognize the caliber of acting that came from our actors. Here we have the best in the industry proving that they can handle the pressures of a huge budget, yet also place 100% of their heart into a smaller scale. Their ability to create this noir-styled picture and stay with the style created back in the 40s was impressive. The 40s released some of my favorite films, and these actors paid a huge homage to them. Some will argue that the dialogue is choppy and humorously bad at times, but I say that you need to explore some of the 40s crime noir films and see that they are just building on an already beautiful structure. Everyone involved in this film was outstanding. I cannot think of one character that I disliked or thought could have done better. I think it is the fact that I have to give credit to Rodriguez for revitalizing the careers (and showing the world what amazing older talent we have) of Rutger Hauer, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe, and Michael Madsen. These guys proved that they are some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood. Also, Sin City proved that Clive Owen will be in Hollywood for a very long time and will soon have every award imaginable. He is my new Hollywood God.Overall, and if you couldn't tell already, I thought this was a perfect film. Criterion, this film is all yours.Grade: ***** out of *****",10,2,5,15 April 2005
Braveheart," Would you trade your land for freedom?
","Gibson, to create 'Braveheart', pulled from every epic imaginable. His use of battle sequences, heroics, and individuality ring eerily close to that of 'Spartacus', 'Gladiator', and 'Ben-Hur', yet even with these clichés riding well within the film, Gibson creates his own style and voice. Watching this epic, one must take it in four different slices to fully appreciate the work, and while they all may pair differently apart, it is what they do together that creates the magic. To begin, the direction is nearly flawless. A scene that stands out is when one of the nobles is dreaming of an attacking Wallace, only to wake and witness Wallace barge in through the door in a beautiful black stallion. It, like many other scenes, was breathtaking and flawless. Gibson has an eye for shots that are considered 'beautifully gruesome', meaning that colors, placement, and camera angle are visionary, while the action on screen may make your stomach a bit squeamish. His direction showed a realistic view of the battle and filth surrounding Scotland during this dark time, and it is his work behind the camera that continues to make this film rank amongst the greatest ever.The next element that one must slice into is the story, which in my eyes, is the weakest element to this film. While it is emotional to watch the love story unfold, the eye-candy battle sequences, and the picture-esquire view of Scotland, there seemed to be a lacking 'meat' to this story. Wallace was angered by what happened to his one true love, but we never get the chance to see his years of living with Uncle Argyle come into fruition. He spouts Latin and French randomly, he uses original battle tactics, and there is talk of Rome at one point, but I wouldn't have found it difficult at all to see a young William Wallace take shape under Argyle. It would have been impressive to see this hero's roots, to take his passion from more than just his father's death into a whole new realm. Throughout this film, watching it in 2008, there wasn't much substance to Wallace. He fought with pride, patriotism, and with his heart, but we never were able to define him as a character. We knew he could fight  but how? We knew he loved this girl from the village  but we needed a deeper back story! The fight scenes were brilliant, but they did not help me see the true William Wallace. We charged through the film making it from points A to B to C, but never gave us the appetizers in between. More critical today of films than I was in 1995, perhaps a viewpoint from the English side would have strengthened the background. I don't believe all English were this harsh, where were the other elements that may have helped Wallace's crusade? These are just missing pieces that would have strengthened 'Braveheart' and pushed it to a new level.Needless to say, the next slice is sound. The power of the battlefield, the yell of Wallace's 'FREEDOM' and the bagpipes echoing through James Horner's score engulfs the power of the film. It is the sound that makes 'Braveheart' the epic that it is. Without the sounds of battle, without the sounds of the majestic mountains, without the sound of love  this could not have won the awards it did. As a viewer, it is the most exciting part of this film and the flawless. While one can argue there are directorial decisions that Gibson could have done better, stronger acting choices, and a more structured story  it is the sound that goes without question. It is perfection. Horner's work is mesmerizing and fantastic. He should have won an Oscar for his sole work on this picture.Finally, there is the acting of 'Braveheart'. Gibson wasn't nominated for an Oscar, which doesn't surprise me watching it now in 2008. Gibson, prior to this film, was thought of as the pretty boy/bad boy persona. Seeing it in the theaters women were swooning over the scantily clad Gibson and that in itself proves that he didn't shake the predetermined image. There were scenes in which Gibson was smiling, or that his eyes seemed to be bluer than the sky, or that blood seemed to be splattered to an exact location on his body  he seemed to have trouble shaking the beauty of Gibson  and I fault him for that. The others in the film were decent, but nobody stood out as exemplary. Coupled with the less meaty story, the characters seemed cliché ridden. There was the 'best-friend', the 'love-interest', the bad King, and the loyal psychopath  all of which can be seen in any other period piece film. I don't believe the acting was up to par with the rest of the film, and the Academy noticed. Overall, despite my best efforts to find major flaws with this film, it is still an amazing piece of cinema to watch. 'Braveheart' deserves every award that it has won and others should credit it as the launching pad that finally gave us 'Last Temptation of Christ' and 'Apocalypto'. Gibson has taken his fame from this film, changed the glamour of it all, and handed us some gritty portraits of the past. I wish he could have done the same here, but I don't think 1995 was ready for it. Gibson pushed the envelope with gore and carnage, and it continues to steal your breath away  yet 'Braveheart' needed to be more than just that. He couples it with amazing sound, but troubles it with a struggling story and weak characters. Watch it  over and over. It may be a long film, but it is worth every minute.Grade: **** out of *****",9,1,5,21 February 2008
Donnie Darko," The search for God is absurd?
","For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre. After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film. One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction. This is something to think about when you watch this edition. The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change. Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer. That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities. He does this by adding chapters from the book 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences. Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality. This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie. We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist. There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition. I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original. There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic. This powerfully sealed the film for me. It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him. It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place. Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form. The way the director wanted it to be. We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake. The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film. Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song 'Mad, Mad World'? It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film. Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel? The truth is out there? Not unless you have seen this film. There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film. This was not the case here. Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story. The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch. It will be up to you to see if this is true or not. Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list. I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut. It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come. You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today. It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.Grade: ***** out of *****",Null,0,1,7 November 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," I remember good things all the time.
","I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails  bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the 'story'? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.Grade: ** out of *****",2,5,9,10 December 2004
V for Vendetta," Chapter 11: Valhalla
","'V for Vendetta' is more than just a masked terrorist running amok in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers. This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster. While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through. Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold. The 'happy' ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel. The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film. 'V for Vendetta' the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered. Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film? To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of 'V' perfectly. The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended. Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant. The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character. 'V', with this film, became iconic. Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded 'V'. The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak. 'V' was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control. Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character – and then there was Portman. While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate. Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding. These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.'V for Vendetta' is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by 'Cat Power'), and intense ideals. It is a thinking film. It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments. It will keep your mind occupied for hours. McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting. As mentioned before, what makes 'V for Vendetta' the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film – it moved it in a different direction. Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought – but it isn't a complete masterpiece. I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today – the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time. Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.Grade: *** out of *****",6,2,8,31 May 2009
