Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite fun
","This movie has many iconic and fun moments in star wars saga to remember like the battle with Darth Maul, the race and two rising Holywood stars Liam Neeson as a badass Jedi master and Natalie Portman as a princess. You also see Obi Wan as the master of Luke Skywalker in his first steps. Of course Anakin as kid steals the show. Amazing performance by Jake Lloyd. I don't understand why many people didn't like this movie. I loved to see Darth Vader's first steps in life and was quite shocked to know starting from this movie that he was once a good boy.",7,0,1,29 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Clever spin off
",While the plot was great as an idea and it connected brilliantly with the original trilogy I felt like the movie was rushed and this led to bad character development. It was a huge step forward although from the disaster the last star wars movies were and make you smile at the end.,6,0,3,12 February 2020
Aquaman," Quite fun movie
","The truth is I don't know much about Aquaman to compare how good he was transfered from comics. But anyway the movie was cool and I can't think it could do anything better being an intro movie for a hero. Interesting plot, spectacular visual effects and very good cast. I am looking forward for the second movie. Aquaman is the wild card of DC",7,1,2,22 February 2020
The Terminator," A genius film
","This movie was beyond its time and defined not only an era but eras. It even inspired the creation of Mr. X and Nemesis in resident evil games. Amazing scenario with many things that have happened and may happen in the future, great soundtrack and acting. A classic gem of an amazing franchise",9,1,3,29 January 2020
Ready Player One," Back to the 80s!
",I really enjoyed this movie especially for all the movie and videogame references that I recognised. It really had the magic of that era. A must watch if you were born back then. Spielberg please do more movies like this. I am so happy you found yourself,8,1,1,27 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great conclusion
","Episode VI finishes the story of the first two trilogies with many memorable fights, deaths and a touching finale. Luke is at his best as a Jedi, we have an amazing rescue for Han Solo from Jaba with Princess Leia being in a super sexy dress, we have the cute ewoks, the death of Master Yoda after serving his cost seeing Luke ready to face his father and having passed the information about Leia being his sister, we see Anakin being released form dark force in order to save his son and kills the emperor. Seriously there so many unforgettable moments in this movie that conclude everything that happened in the previous amazing 5 movies and it makes you very happy that the good guys triumph after all. That last scene of Luke seeing the Jedi ghosts of Anakin, Obi Wan and Yoda being happy that finally the galaxy is saved from the forces of evil leaves you with a big smile.",9,0,0,27 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A good ending for an awful trilogy
","While I was really pissed off with episode 7 and 8 making no sense at all, paying zero respect to the characters of the previous movies and the continuity, I felt that this time at least it made some sense and fixed things somewhat, giving at least some purpose of existence to this awful trilogy overall that should never existed the way it did. This time around I had some fun",6,1,11,19 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The most underrated star wars movie ever
","The truth is the first time I had watched the movie I wasn't impressed. After rewatches over the years I realised this movie gets so much hate that it didn't deserve. Especially if you compare it to the new movies (episodes 7, 8,9) it is far better in script, character development and battles. Anakin is awesome in this movie and makes you feel totally familiar with yourself the way he acts following your heart instead of cold rules.",7,12,17,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The most underrated star wars movie ever
",For years I considered this movie boring and was my least favourite of the series. After rogue one and Solo I did a rewatch to the whole saga and completely changed my mind about episode 2. I has by far the best light saber battles. Great action scenes overall and we see Anakin at his best as Jedi. Also the whole politics plot everyone was hating is amazing after all to see how genius were Palpatine's actions. Comparing to the new awful trilogy this movie seems a like masterpiece now so do your self a favour and watch it again if you ever dislike it. You will be surprised how well it has aged.,7,3,4,27 February 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Decent but entertaining
",Comparing to 1 and 2 this movie wasn't that good but on the other hand it was quite entertaining action film. It still surprises you after so many years how evolutionary it was in special effects. I am sure Michael Bay love this movie. I was happy to see Christiana Loken from Mortal Kombat Conquest in it,7,0,0,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The worst star wars movie ever
","Seriously there was nothing that I liked in this movie and that's because it kept dragging that joke of episode 7, the new wannabe Darth Vader. Apart from that Luke Skywalker was out of character. A total failure this movie from every aspect",1,9,13,28 January 2020
Joker," Quite disappointing
","Based on the hype from everyone I know I was expecting a masterpiece. Unfortunately if you take away Phoenix's performance which was on spot as a person with psychological problems who gets rejected by society, the movie was a total let down and I fail to understand what was so special about it. It doesn't even worth a rewatch. Again another overrated DC movie",5,3,7,25 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best stars wars movie ever!
",When I first saw that movie back when it came out to the cinemas I had low hopes of seeing something good especially because the first movie was OK and the second awful. To my surprise all of that lead to such an epic finale to the trilogy with on the most badass villains we have ever witnessed. It felt like watching Tommy Oliver in 'Green with Evil' but in a star wars universe. Being a huge power rangers fan myself it gave me the exact same feeling.,10,1,2,29 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney what have you done?
",There are so many wrong things in this movie that it really makes me wonder if the writers have ever watched the previous 6 movies. I mean come on...In episode 6 the rebels won the war and destroyed the Empire. We saw the people happy in the whole galaxy. I can understand that sith could return somehow but on the other hand it makes no sense that Luke did nothing to protect the galaxy from a feature threat. He should have built a Jedi academy and first of all train his sister. It makes no sense that Ben Solo wasn't protected from turning to dark side by him and his parents. Not only that but Kylo Ren was pathetic and weak. Killing his dad didn't make sense and it wasn't the end the most beloved character in star wars saga deserved. And last I have to speak about Rey. Enough with the macho women for no reason in movies already. She was really boring as a character and felt like thrown to the movie from out of nowhere. Disney also keep a note. Lightsaber is not a toy anyone can hold. The only chance someone will like this movie is if he hasn't watched the previous star wars movies. Otherwise he will be mad about this disgrase. George Lucas how could you let this happen? :(,1,7,9,28 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that created the sci-fi culture
","This is the movie that started it all and it holds great after so many years. It even makes far more sense if you rewatch it after the spin off movies Rogue One and Solo. In fact it continues where Rogue one ended which is awesome. The special effects, the music and the cast are phenomenal.",9,0,0,20 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Great sequel
",This movie made Darth Vader one the most iconic evil guy ever. Rewatching it after Han's Solo movie I was happy to see what happened to Lando. The battles were cool and led to many videogames. Han's romance with Leia had nice progress. Yoda was awesome as a teacher. I would prefer just a better training to Luke. It felt rushed and the results were bad because of it. A great movie anyway that makes you want to see how the trilogy will end. If the purpose was to make the heroes seem in a very bad situation with no hope of winning it succeeded its course. For some reason I enjoyed New Hope more. Maybe I don't like bad guys winning idk,8,0,0,20 February 2020
