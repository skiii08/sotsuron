Blade Runner 2049," A gorgeous dystopia but is that what we need?
",It was an incredible film. Every frame was sumptuous and the sound effects and music quite epic (I wasn't always sure where one started and the other ended). By the end of it though I was a nervous wreck. Of the current glut of dystopian films this was fantastic. HOWEVER we have a glut of dystopian movies. ALL the previews before the film showed the Earth in periled by disaster or monsters or aliens. Being in the biz I know the big shots will say 'it's what the public wants'. If they want to help the future of Earth maybe they need to give the public what it needs. We need hope and we need visions of a better future and the entertainment industry could very well lead the way if it wasn't so absorbed with pandering for megabucks.,10,2,8,10 October 2017
