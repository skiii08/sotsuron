Hereditary," It really is a waste of 2 hours.
","I'll keep it short... don't waste time and money on this film. I gave this film 1 out of 10 simply because 0 wasn't an option to select. I can appreciate a difference in opinion on most things subjective, but I am gobsmacked how this film could receive any rating above 2. To compare this with The Exorcist is pure marketing hyperbole. Again, don't waste your time.",1,4,9,30 June 2018
