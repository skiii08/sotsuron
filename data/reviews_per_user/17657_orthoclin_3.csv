The Avengers," Super hero action movie
","Brilliant! Luckily I was able to take my Tweens to this movie to a packed house on opening night. This is now their favorite movie.Rarely have I been to a film in recent years that has the audience cheering and clapping as the closing credits start and this is one of them. From start to finish it is well played,well paced and spectacular to watch.The movie begins where last years Captain America and Thor left off with Thor's brother Loki playing the villain. A lot of super hero,occasionally physics defying, action ensues as the team is brought together as well as some well placed humor.Marvel Studios will have a hard task improving on this and already my 11 year old wants to see it again. I had so much fun watching this one I wouldn't mind seeing it again myself.Go see it,you won't be disappointed",10,2,5,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Post apocalyptic Sci-fi screen adaptation
","Overall,best movie in years.Best for those who have read book.Written in first person the novel is an easy read though more graphic and as disturbing to any parent of teenage or tween children than the film but very little is left out.The editing is clipped and hand held camera unsteady at start of film with many shots less than.5-.25 s but it slows down once the tributes are selected and the effects are worked in seamlessly as the characters arrive at the capital.Hopefully the point of the film,it's message against violence,oppression,racism and economic inequality is not lost on the bulk of those viewing it. Go see this film-excellent cast well directed-never drags and sets new bar for science fiction.",10,3,9,29 March 2012
American Made," Thoroughly entertaining story of drug smuggler of the 1980's
","After many years of business some of it risky along comes Mr Cruise in a sleeper.This is a must see as it really informs the audience well about the underworld dealings of the drug trade the CIA government and how one man can be so critical to it all . Anyone who remembers the 1980's can recall the Regan years and this is a great inside look into this aspect of those years. Great editing ,directing, pace and performances by Cruise and Gleeson and Sarah Wright kept one riveted to this picture.This will grow at box office through word of mouth as well .Highly recommend",10,5,10,1 October 2017
