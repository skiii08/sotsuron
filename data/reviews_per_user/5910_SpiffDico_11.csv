Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," This film's no mystery to see.
","When talking about the greatest fictional detective of Britain Sherlock Holmes, and the many movies based on this iconic character, many have seen the most memorable of actors, Basil Rathbone to be the one we think of the most. Lines like 'Elementary, my dear Watson' have been used from generation to generation, letting others know of the legacy of the character Sir Arthur Doyle had given to the world.Since 2009, director Guy Ritchie had given this generation a NEW Sherlock Holmes, portrayed by former SNL comedian, Robert Downey Jr, who had gained the role of also portraying Iron Man. Downey had given a fantastically stunning performance in both the Iron Man AND Sherlock Holmes films, that it's difficult to explain how more good he's become. The way that he pays good tribute to the character of Holmes and what Rathbone had given, he also manages to create his own Holmes as well. He's smart, witty, and strong willed, especially with his amazing predictions. As for Jude Law, he himself brings new depths into the character of Dr. John Watson, Holmes' sidekick. The chemistry between the two is in such well depth, that it almost makes you think that the two of them are brothers. With that, the original stands as a strong, well determined piece of art that is both fun and intense.With this new film, it's much of the same. It continues the story of Holmes, with a new case that could possibly be his last, or at least that's how I felt about it. Sherlock and Watson are reprized by the duo of Downey and Law, as they try to figure out what plan is in develop by Professor Moriarty, played by Jared Harris. Harris gives off the attitude of a smart villain, giving everything his best shot, and does a well done job at doing it. Stephen Croft plays Sherlock's brother, Mycroft Holmes, and gives a few good laughs with his cheery performance, and his ways of assisting his brother in the film.Is the film as good as the original? No, I found some scenes to be a bit slow, boring, and not well examined. But is it good? Yes. Is it worth the ticket price in theaters? Yes. I guarantee that audiences who enjoyed the first film will enjoy this new film, and it deserves a viewing every once and a while. If you got the time, then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is one of the perfect works of art, and in my opinion, one of the best films of the year.",Null,1,2,5 January 2012
Sucker Punch," Film...just sucks.
","This movie fails...now, i'll be honest, i haven't seen any of Zack Snyder's work, like 300 and Watchmen, so i don't know what his directing is like, but this movie...was probably not his best....at all. Looking at this film, it just made me confused about the plot, because it didn't make sense on any level, and leaves a whole bunch of plot holes. I mean, there's this whole thing in the intro, where the mother dies, the stepfather gets angry because he wasn't included in the will, and kills one of the daughters, while the other is sent to a mental institute. And guess what? THEY NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN!! I kid you not! they forget it! i mean, COME ON Snyder! if people loved your work with Watchmen and 300, then why are you failing on this?!....there are other things like that, that annoyed me.....but i'll give the movie credit, it wasn't boring. it had decent action, even though it was in the mind of a little girl who's practically in her underwear (Wha?!), the acting wasn't that impressive, especially from that chick from Dragon Ball Evolution (CHI CHI MY ASS!) and this film felt more like Sailor Moon to me.....I'm not kidding. This literally feels like i've been watching an episode of Sailor Moon, stretched into 2 hours. overall, it's just a basic popcorn flick, that's just low on story, and just disappoints. I wouldn't recommend this, but if you're up for seeing it, go for it. though i'd wait for a discount theater, or wait till it's out on TV or netflix/redbox or even on demand, it got one thing right, for me...it sucked.",Null,2,6,5 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What the hell?...just...just what the hell?
","I guess before hand, i should talk about the other films just to get it out of the way. The first film, directed by Catherine Hardwick, was a boring schlock-fest, based on the book series that, for some UNEXPLAINED reason, has a cult following. But the first film was just boring, lousy, had no story, bland acting you'd find in an exploitation film, and effects that make Michael Bay fall into a coma with boredom. The Second film, New Moon, had gone lower, with it's effects even cheesier, the acting just as bland, and hundreds of unintentionally funny moments that make the film just as bad. And lastly, Eclipse, which has been considered the best by many, but considered the worst by others. I considered it the worst, due to it repeating the same conversations over and over again, and having a backstory from one of the villains be much more interesting to learn than the bullshit love-story that we have to listen to.Now...Breaking Dawn...it honestly is the worst of them. I'm not kidding. I'm still trying to figure out how this is possible.Breaking Dawn part 1 is nothing but a padded out mess of a film, that adapts from the book into 2 films, but in this case, THERE'S NO REASON FOR THERE TO BE 2 FILMS! Hell, there's literally no reason for this to be a film series at all! With what little story, character development, and acting, you could easily make the Twilight movies into 3 films at the least! They pad this movie constantly with montages, and yet it's rushed when by the end of this movie she has the baby and becomes a vampire. If you've rushed your movie to where it goes down to the final battle that's coming in part 2, what the hell's the point of even HAVING 2 films?! And plus, for them to mention such grizzly stuff that happens in the book, yet they don't have even decide to go all out on it, then why the hell didn't you just do THAT?! It still would've sucked, since this whole series is crap, but it would've been the least bad of them! Twilight doesn't even deserve to be called a saga, if it has nothing to offer! Story? It padded. Characters? What characters? Heart? It has none. Cinematography? Painful on all levels! If anything, the Harry Potter films are worthy of the name 'saga' because it has all. Story, characters, heart, and great cinematography. I will at least admit, that Stephanie Meyer had an interesting idea. It sounded interesting, but after watching these films, it makes me sick now. These films are butchering the vampire genre! Vampires don't sparkle! Werewolves do not change on their own! Why is Bella Swan considered the icon of teenage girls of this generation? If that's the case, then this is offending every teenage girl AND guy to a high level! For this series to be one of the highest grossing franchises around and MTV giving it the reward for Best Drama and Best Film is shameful. If this series wants to get some...SOME appreciation from everyone as what it's stated by people, then it should be rebooted and redone in a way that people would enjoy! The only characters that are sympathetic are Jake and Charles (Bella's dad). They're reasonable. They have character. They actually know how to do well!Overall, Breaking Dawn part 1 is POINTLESS! The only reason these films are made are for money. That's all they are! They're cash-grabbers. If anything, these films should be put on trial for assault on the vampire and werewolf genre, and thievery on everyone's wallet and purse!",Null,6,7,5 January 2012
Just Go with It," Sandler's next film...is pretty basic.
","Honestly, i had expected everything that was coming from this movie. The premise, the resolution, most of the jokes...and i was happy about knowing it...Now, let me tell you this, real quick; Comedy is like one of my least favorite genres. why? well, when you see a good comedy, it's fantastic. when you see a bad movie, you can laugh at how bad it is. But with a bad comedy...NOTHING is funny about it. And i'll admit, this one made me laugh a lot, and was actually entertaining, for how well it was executed. The jokes was alright, there are some things that aren't really expected from this, and the acting, especially with the children, were good. I don't think i've seen kids act that well in a film with Adam Sandler, since Big Daddy, which was my first AND favorite Adam Sandler movie. But, other than that, it's nothing special. I wouldn't actually recommend this, but if you want to see it, then go for it.",Null,0,2,5 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher's comeback film
","There have been many films this year that have caught interest in many. With the film 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', directed by Fight Club director, David Fincher, many fans of the book that the film's based on were cautious, since there has been a Swedish film that was faithful to the fist book of three. I, myself, was as cautious as them, only it was due to Fincher's last film, 'The Social Network'. Many had been pleased with the film about Facebook creator, Mark Zuckerberg, mostly due to being users of the site. Even though I've used the site as well, I can't help but feel that the film had lacked much character into this and that Eisenberg, who portrayed Zuckerberg in the film, gave a performance of a golden toaster; might look impressive, but there's not much to it. Now with David Fincher's newest film, what can be said about it. Well, it can easily be past as a much better film than Social Network will be to me.With what the story goes, Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner and author for Millennium Magazine, and is now being hired to solve the case of the disappearance of the great niece of Henrik Vanger, played by Christopher Plummer. While finding some clues, he then calls upon Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara, to help him out, all while developing a strong relationship together. For being one of my most anticipated movies of the year, I had high hopes thinking it would be one of the best films I've seen this year, with all the hype it's been getting. But alas, it's not as much as they say it to be. Granted, it wasn't anywhere CLOSE to bad, but it was still kinda underwhelming. Though, I still would watch this more times and find it more developed than 'The Social Network', even if 'Dragon Tattoo' is two hours and forty minutes long. The performances delivered by each of the actors was well done and didn't in the slightest bore me, with much suspense given to the story, and not once using jumps to scare the everliving pants off us. It takes it's time with it, bringing up to the strong ending that the characters will have to deal with. Even though I never read the book, nor did I watch the Swedish versions, I found it to still be a good film at the least.Overall, 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is an exciting thriller with excellent acting from a great cast of people, and with some scenes, you'd know why they would give this film an 'R' rating. It's not done so much, to what most comedies today want to do, but in the essence of making an exciting thriller.",Null,2,7,5 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Impossible Became Possible...This was really good.
","Looking over films based on TV shows are almost impossible to make better, let alone just as good, as the show was. Somehow, most of the turn out to be complete garbage, like:The Avengers Get Smart Transformers 2 Beverly Hillbillies Yogi Bear The Smurfs Doug The Last Airbender (shudders)But, that's not to say there have been a few decent ones, like:Ninja Turtles 1,2, & 4 The Adams Family Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker The A-Team G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra Transformers 3 Transformers: The Movie Most of the Muppet moviesMany have had hit and misses over the past thirty years now, but today we're going to be talking about the film series, based on the TV show, Mission Impossible.Now, bear in mind, I haven't actually seen ONE episode of the TV show, so all I can really do is look at the films as films along. I might as well give my synopsis on the other films first then. The first film, directed by Scarface director, Brian de Palma, is about IMF agent, Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, framed for the murders of his comrades and selling government secrets to the villain of the film. Now it's up to Cruise to get the files back and clear his name. For what it was, it was a cheesy action film, with Cruise doing what he does best. For what it was, it was pretty good, thanks to Ving Rhames delivering a pretty good performance. The second film, directed by John Woo, was not as good as the first, but somehow did a very creative job at bringing forth an okay film. Cruise was still Cruise, Rhames was still bad-ass, and Anthony Hopkins in the film was nice in it too. Now the third film, directed by Super 8 director and creator of Lost, J.J. Abrams, managed to make it the superior film. The plot of it, was Ethan was getting married and about to retire as an IMF agent leader, but when his team tries to get rid of an object dubbed 'The Rabbit Foot', he and his team have to fix things up, with his marriage on hold, and him returning. Simon Pegg was a nice addition to the film, and gave a well done performance. For a while, it was a good finish to the franchise, and for what it was, we would remember this trilogy to be cheesy...That is, until today, when Iron Giant and Incredibles director, Brad Bird decided to bring forth another film.So how does the new film stand out?...well, I gotta say...I now understand WHY it's got a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol takes place five years after the last film, as Ethan Hunt is broken out of jail, and learns from his team that someone is planning on starting a nuclear war with Russia and America. Soon, the IMF is down to Hunt and his team, along with William Brandt, to finish off this mission and clear the IMF's name. For being his first live-action film, Brad Bird managed to make this Mission Impossible film, not only good, but fantastic! I enjoyed a LOT out of this film, from beginning to end, and it really stands out as the best of the Mission Impossible film series. This is definitely one of the best action film that I've seen this year, and it stands out as one of Tom Cruise's best work. The acting is great, the action's great, and the story is, surprisingly, well done. But, apparently, it does have it's cheesy moments, that even Ving Rhames finds to be stupid.Overall, MI4GP is great, might have it's moments of stupidity, but I found it great. If you're looking for a good action film or a good Brad Bird film, I highly recommend it, but if you don't like Tom Cruise or the Mission Impossible films, then you probably won't like it.",Null,2,5,5 January 2012
Insidious," It's scary...but I wouldn't call it the best.
","Alright, might as well talk about the newest movie i've seen. And that movie would be Insidious...honestly, i liked this movie. no joke, i found this to be a really good movie. Though, as i look back on it, it really was suspenseful, even though its scares, were all jump scares. gee, haven't seen THAT before. speaking of which, i felt like this was kind of a remake of Poltergeist, but in a good way. i actually started to like the characters, and the story. it really is like Poltergeist, except all of the flab of it was cut out of it. but that's not all. it not only felt like Poltergeist, but it also felt like Paranormal Activity (thank god i saw that, before this), and Nightmare on Elm Street (the good version). Now when i saw the trailer for this, the plot was already explained, but i forgot it (woot! barely any spoilers!), and that it was being directed by James Wan, the director and writer of the first Saw film, and producer of the rest. I felt like this was going to be crap, but i was wrong. I recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of horror, or to take a date with (in case they get scared, if you know what i mean). it's definitely the best horror film that's come out, since Paranormal Activity 2 (saw that too. can't wait for the 3rd film). though, after all i said, it's not bad, but nothing special. i only said that, since it's a GOOD horror film, unlike Red Riding Hood...........Oh god, why did i sit through that.....",Null,0,0,5 January 2012
Unknown," Not very Unknown now!
","Let me tell you, I love Liam Neeson. he is a fantastic actor, especially with action films. i mean, i loved the A-Team, but apparently, my favorite of his work goes to Love Actually. But this was damn well done. The way that Unknown is directed is very well paced, and the acting is amazingly well done. The way that the character Liam Neeson plays of trying to find out who he really is, has an interesting vibe to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what's going to happen next. Plus, the action scenes they show is well shot, and gives you that adrenalin rush that good actions films give us. Not to mention, the twist at the end, is purely amazing, and it explains the confusion that anyone who sees this film gets. So, if you like Liam Neeson and/or action dramas, this movie is for you.",Null,0,1,5 January 2012
Puss in Boots," Kitty's got enough lives to make it!
","Now before we begin, I'll make this quick on what i thought of the Shrek films. The first one, at the time, was a clever work of art that got Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as a pretty good duo of animation voices for quite a while now. It was fresh, new, and one of Dreamwork's best CGI animated features. Shrek 2, was absolutely amazing. It took everything that made the original Shrek good and made it an amazing comedy! It introduced Puss in Boots as a spin-off of Zorro just hysterical, ESPECIALLY since he's played by Antonio Banderas, who played Zorro in the Martin Campbell movies, Mask of Zorro and Legend of Zorro. Overall, Shrek 2 is by far one of the best sequels that could ever be made by Dreamworks. Now for Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After, all i got to say for those films is.......meh. they were okay.So now, Dreamworks still has a good hold for the franchise, but now with Puss in Boots. So how was it? well, let's discuss it first.The movie's what you expect it to be, an origin story of the whiskered outlaw with boots. It explains his backstory on how he became an outlaw and what he did to redeem himself of being no longer the villain his home town thought him to be, seven years after he was betrayed by a former comrade. For what it gives us, it's a pretty entertaining movie and shows a lot to give.Antonio Banderas reprises his role as Puss, and does a good a job as he always he does. Salma Hayek plays Kitty Softpaws, Puss's love interest and a master thief. She could take the shirt off your back so fast, it'd take you 10 seconds to realize you lost it. Hayek's not unfamiliar with working with Banderas, so she knows the right style of acting to choose with him. Zach Galifianakis plays Humpty Alexander Dumpty, and is pretty good in the role. Despite being in the Hangover movies with barely anything funny once in a while, he at least tries to give a pretty good performance. Guillermo del Toro has a pretty good cameo in the film, and it works out well, since he's also the executive producer of the film.One more thing I want to talk about is the 3D in this film, and this film's in the category for good 3D. Animation. The animation in the film, while CG, is gorgeous. Dreamworks has a thing for making such well made animated films, becoming it's own stronghold for CG animation, along with some of their films to have some well done action. Sure, i still prefer hand drawn animation, but i'm not saying CG animation is bad. I'm just saying it's overused. But back to the 3D. Like i said, animated films are one of the only category in movies that work best for 3D. And for this, it looks amazing. Is it as good as Pixar 3D movies? No, but it's still worth it.Overall, Puss in Boots is a fun family film that really knows how to be entertaining. It's comedy, action, and dark story all in one.",Null,3,3,5 January 2012
Limitless," This film has no limit to it's amazement.
","Now let me just say, Bradley Cooper is one of those actors who gets the same amount of responses as Shia LaBeouf. You either love him or hate him. They have some good films, and some bad ones. And I do think that the two of them are good actors. Plus, Cooper is an actor that no matter what film he's in, I can find some enjoyment out of him. I mean, have you SEEN Hangover? But I digress. Let's talk about Bradley Cooper's movie, Limitless. Now, when this movie came out in theaters, I wasn't really that interested in seeing it, because it didn't look like my kind of movie. And unfortunately, I was wrong. This movie's pretty good.Limitless is the story of Eddie Morra, who's trying to get his book selling and his career straight, after his girlfriend just dumped him. After acquiring a certain drug, he's able to boost his focus by tenfold, and try to pull his life back into order. But due to this, he's gets into a certain conflict, where the people around him are threatened, and needs a way to get out of the mess he's gotten himself into. The movie gives off a pretty good Inception vibe, on the fact that you really need to pay attention to it, and it really has some good action with it.Cooper plays Eddie, and gives a good performance throughout the film as he does with others. Robert DeNiro plays Carl, Eddie's boss, and gives it the typical Robert DeNiro performance, and is good in anything he's in (And I mean ANYTHING). Abbie Cornish, who you may remember as Sweat Pea in Sucker Punch, plays Lindy. She gives a pretty solid performance, and it works in this movie. Plus, her talent isn't wasted in an action film that has absolutely no story. The rest of the characters do a pretty good job with what they're given, so I don't have much to complain though.That's all I got, so overall, Limitless is a smart action film, with an interesting story, and knows how to give story and action well. Is it as good as Inception? No. But I'll give credit, that it IS close. It definitely is Bradley Cooper's best action flick since the A-Team.",Null,0,0,5 January 2012
Rango," Reach for the skies..Lizard!
","Looking at the promos for this film, i feel like that this movie was just going to be a basic 3D kids movie, with Johnny Depp acting like himself (except a lizard), dealing with mistaken identities, and that it was going to be a fun time...That, and the fact that Abigail Breslin is in it. Sorry, can't help it. But yeah, when i went to go see this movie with my brother, we were both surprised on how dark it was. The images were pretty gruesome, the humor was a little lacking, and it has a habit of swearing a lot in it. But only the basic 'hell' and 'damn', nothing else. It's actually quite an accomplishment to make this a kids movie, because it's not, even for Nickalodian studios standards. I mean, i could see Disney getting away with it, back in the 90's, but this i think was pushing it. But does that make it bad? No. It's a pretty good movie, that i guess i can recommend to some people.",Null,1,1,5 January 2012
