Hereditary," I would have given this 0.0000001 if I could of
","This is one of the worst films you could ever watch. It is dull, boring and nothing of substance happens in it. The plot in it is terrible. It is not scary, it is not dramatic, it is just a waste of your time. The acting by some of the actors is alright but that's the only positive from an extremely weak film. I watched this film in a packed cinema just after it was released. At least 10 people walked out and most of the rest were laughing at it especially towards the end of the film. How anyone enjoyed this film and gave it a high rating is beyond me. Please don't waste your time and if you do remember this review afterwards.",1,2,9,1 July 2018
