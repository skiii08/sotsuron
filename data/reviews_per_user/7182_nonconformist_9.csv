3:10 to Yuma," Unbelievable
",I've always said I've never seen Russell Crowe in a good movie and this one is no exception. I know people love westerns and I do too but this movie just stinks. First off it has every cliché in the book and it would take days to tell about every stupid action taken by the characters. I could have overlooked some of these faults but it has an ending that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I've seen some dumb endings but this one is a whopper. I defy anyone to explain it.I cannot believe these high ratings. The quality of movies being made just keeps sinking lower and lower.I think I'll rent to old one and watch it.,1,13,23,12 January 2008
Minority Report," A pointless assault on the senses.
","This film is nothing but a clothesline movie to hang special effects, action scenes and feeble attempts at humor. I won't talk about how ridicules and unbelievable the plot is, it would take too much time.  What really surprises me is that people like it.  Are we really so brain dead that we must be bombarded with visuals every few seconds to watch a film?  The interaction between people in this film could have been done with robots. Wait a minute. I think they were.Don't waste your time on this trash and just go rent blade runner again",1,5,10,2 February 2003
The Fifth Element," Might be useful as a interrogation tool?
","Forget water torture. Just leave this movie playing for a few days with no way to turn it off. I had brought a small DVD player to work and this movie just happened to be in it and I can safely say that is the only possible reason I watched all of it. I had nothing else to watch.Someone walked in and said 'what's you watching?' I said 'The Fifth Element' and he said 'man, that movie is f***ed up'. That was an understatement. It's not just boring; it's also very irritating. Who ever did the casting must have been completely insane. The fact that this thing even exits is a testament to the sad state of movie making.If you rent this, make sure you have a back-up plan.",2,5,11,20 December 2006
The Doors," Meg Ryan? You've got to be kidding!
","If she wasn't in the film I probably would have given it another star. Stone also overdid the indian thing too.  But still, hollywood doing a movie on the doors.....  I think we were lucky it was as good as it was.  Kilmer looked so much like Morrison it was scary.  All the naked girls helped give it the feel of the time and helped me pay attention too.  If nothing else it was great to hear all those songs again and know that others wanted to hear them again enough for a movie like this to be made.I didn't see the movie when it came out because I was sure I would pick it apart, but I actually enjoyed the film.*** 1/2 out of five",8,1,1,9 January 2003
Elf," A steaming pile of , well you know ....
",I didn't laugh one time. Not once. I thought Will Ferrel was kind of funny on SNL But he isn't funny in movies. I wasn't surprised Ed Asner would be in something of such low quality but I was kind of surprised James Caan would. Caan should know better. It tries to be funny but falls flat. It tries to be heart warming but the try is faint and fails. The love element is all but embarrassing for the lady in the movie and unbelievable for the audience. Movies like this aren't supposed to great art but they are supposed to be entertaining on at least a child like level but Elf just can't even manage that. Don't waste the time with this dud.,1,10,32,4 January 2009

Children of Men," A film by George Soros? Could have been..
","Maybe I'm unaware of something. Has the twenty-second amendment been repealed? Can George Bush run for a third term? You might think so after watching 'children of men'. This movie is a part of the non-stop assault on the Bush administration by the Hollywood wing of the Democratic Party. Within a few minutes we hear the words 'patriot act' mentioned. Pretty odd for story set twenty years in the future. By the time we're fifteen minutes into the movie the jabs are direct with no pretense of subtlety. It's the story of a man who lives in a society that is controlled by people whose characters could have been created by the Democratic National Committee. No Democratic talking point was missed. I have never seen such shameless propaganda. Even without the political preaching I'm not sure this would be a good movie. The clichés are non-stop. Clearly the intend audience is overage hippies and children of them. A conservative watching this movie will need a barf bag close by.As others have mentioned, the high rating also astounded me. Usually movies rated this high have a targeted audiences like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. This movie is NOT an eight. I guess there are more of those old pot-smoking geezers out there than I thought.",1,5,10,1 May 2007
Lord of War," Unconvincing
",Being a gun nut I was told I would love this movie. I didn't. The movie tries to make you believe it knows guns or politics or both but it knows neither. Reminds me of a poser dropping names to appear to know something. Cage's character never for a moment made me be think he was doing anything other than reading a script. And a bad script at that. It does not try to tell a story but rather it tries to make a point. The point was simple and shallow did not even try to imagine the complexities of the modern world. So much more could have been done. I watch movies to be entertained not to be preached at. One of it's worst points is how easy Cage's character went from working in his fathers restaurant to being a big time arms dealer with no more cleverness than to hand someone a envelope of cash.It has high ratings and a lot of people liked it but I can't imagine why.,3,3,9,9 July 2006
Tombstone," Mega-Turkey Western.
","I like westerns as much as anyone but this movie is a gigantic failure.  It doesn't even feel like a movie.  The actors are more like wax museums figures somehow brought to life.  But it's not really life, just a string of carefully constructed scenes that serve only the purpose of being a scene. Like the whole movie was made to serve up a lot of still shots for lobby cards.  What blows me away the most is all the praise for Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holiday.  His pathetic attempt at a southern accent is excruciating to watch.  I don't know how he did it with a straight face.  To all you yankees up north, let me assure you that no one really talks like that (except in Hollywood).I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I have to call it as I see it.",2,12,34,22 February 2004
