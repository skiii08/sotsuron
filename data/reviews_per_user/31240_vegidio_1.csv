The Blair Witch Project," Sad how this movie has such a low rating here
","I can't believe that The Blair Witch Project has such a low rating here at IMDb. Guys, this an intelligent horror movie that changed a lot of things on how movies in general are made today (not only the horror genre).* This is the movie that basically created the Found Footage genre. I know that there were some Found Footage movies before, but this was the movie that made it popular. There are thousands of Found Footage movies nowadays like Chronicle, Cloverfield, REC and so many others that wouldn't exist without the Blair Witch Project.* This is movie that made it popular the viral marketing campaigns. For several blockbusters nowadays, it's almost obligatory to have a marketing campaign and this is the movie that created that!And besides all that, this is a horror movie with a great story. It's not a shitty and gore movie like Serbian Film or a dumb teenage stuff like Scream.",10,14,27,19 May 2015
