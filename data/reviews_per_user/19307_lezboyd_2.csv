The Avengers," 8 Degrees of Awesomeness
","The Avengers displays Joss Whedon's flawless comedic timing, and his ability to balance fun among serious situations perfectly. One can see why Buffy & Angel were a huge success, & Firefly/Serenity a huge cult hit. Welcome to the big leagues, Mr. Whedon.As for the movie, I like this movie's Hulk more than the two stand-alone movies. This movie showcases why the Hulk can work best as a supporting character instead of the lead. Hawkeye, in my opinion, was an odd character to add, and the movie could have done just as well without him. The other characters perform their parts well, but Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark steals the spotlight every time he is on-screen. The chemistry between the cast is seamless. I also loved seeing Coby Smulders as a bad-ass action chick, although its a shame she did not see much action.The only downsides I can think of is the sometimes cheesy dialogs, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, and some very loose usage of technical slang.Other than that, here is a toast to The Avengers, and I am surely up for seeing The Avengers 2, Iron Man 3, and (a man can dream) Coby Smulders in an action movie.",8,6,14,22 August 2012
Prometheus," Amazing prequel that stays true to the mythology and still goes in its unique direction.
","This is a great movie that serves as the perfect prequel to the Alien series of movies. What stands out about this one is that it goes beyond just the mythology surrounding Alien and the xenomorphs, beyond just the CG effects, the jump-shots and action pieces, and asks some real interesting questions. It is rare that you see a movie that has enough references to its predecessors while still managing to be a unique story in itself.Great work by the director, Ridley Scott, as well as the actors involved, especially Noomi Rapace. Can't wait for the sequel! P.S.: Given that the story mostly revolves around Christian theories concerning creation, as well as the fact that it takes its own direction independent of the preceding movies, I don't find it surprising that it has invoked a 'Love it or Hate it' reaction in most people.",6,5,8,10 October 2012
