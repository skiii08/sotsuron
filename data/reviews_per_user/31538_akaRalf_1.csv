Walk the Line," Who is Johnny Cash?
","I always thought that Johnny Cash was just a person that was made up and didn't really exist. You can believe my surprise when I was told this movie was about his life.I went to this movie without knowing anything about this man and so I had no expectations. I expected the movie to be a B-movie and just be some boring life story. I was proved wrong.This movie caught my interest from the start and a part from some parts of the movie where the moments passed slowly, it kept my interest till the end. I remember Joaquin Phoenix (like a lot here) from his play as Commodus in the Gladiator. In that movie he already showed that he could act, but in this movie he clearly shows that he is a great actor. I believed him the way he played Johnny Cash.After I walked out of the cinema I knew not only who Johnny Cash was, but the movie made me more curious about the man. This movie showed me the troubled and yet beautiful life this man has lived. This movie made Johnny Cash a legend for me! 8 out of 10",10,2,4,6 February 2006
