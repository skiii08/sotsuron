The Blair Witch Project," Overall praise: You you serious, why?????
","I went with 3 of my friends, age range 19-60. Without exception we left *very* disapointed and quite ***bewildered*** by the many favorable reviews!Brad, on 28 July said it best!  The characters were really annoying, immature and shallow.  They ran the F*** word into the ground, wondered aimlessly, complained constantly about being lost, argued and bickered like imature children and fought over and over about the lost map.  The whole project was silly and *unrealistic*.  At no time was I able to relinquish reality and allow myself to be drawn into this film; it was just too silly and childish.  It was like sitting through someone's home movies. I would have walked if I'd been alone.****WHAT is it**** about this really AWFUL little film that makes so many critics, and viewers alike, rave on about it so????  Why is it that people find this irritating little film so impressive and so frightening?????I just don't get it! It boggles the mind to think that so many are so impressed by so little.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
