Source Code," Good Science Fiction
","Source Code is a above average Science Fiction film, It is about some kind of time travel ( However, not exactly time travel) the plot of the film is a interesting one, and acting is nearly wonderful. I like Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. The story about a wounded soldier in Afghanistan and his brain, musics of the movie are quite good, and tag line of the movie ( make every second count ) chosen well. Because, it means something when you watch the movie. The best part of the movie is when the movie finish you realize your life's value more and you realize new point of view in your life. Lastly, I can clearly recommend the movie, it is worth seeing",Null,0,2,17 August 2011
Megamind," Really good
","If you like watching animations, you really need watch this movie. I can clearly advice this movie without any doubt and stars like Brad Pitt, Will Ferrell dubbing the movie, and i can clearly say that they did some kind of awesome job because, dubbing is really good. Story of the movie is out of ordinary it can really make you surprise, it looks like a ordinary story but it is much more different from ordinary ones. Graphics are better than a average animation, musics of the film is well selected, they can really put you in mood. As a conclusion, this movie can give you more than what you want from a ordinary animation... you won't regret.",9,1,2,23 January 2011
