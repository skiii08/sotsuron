Casablanca," Nothing special here
","I heard about this movie in a another movie called Overdrawn at the Memory Bank. A hilarious b movie featured on MST3K. Anyway, I noticed Casablanca was on tv and decided to watch it. it was...BORING! There was nothing special about it. It had nothing! I cannot believe it is like the 5th best movie on this web site. Its a decent film, yes. But it does not deserve to be hailed as the best and recognized as it is today.",Null,1,3,27 November 2003
Con Air," Good action packed film with high body count, but some bad editing...
","I've seen Con Air a couple of times, and enjoy the movie. Its just a fun movie meant for guys. The action never stops, and like 20 people die every 5 minutes. The movie is crazy. But what's up with Cage's accent? Its not like him, and he didn't do a good job. I think its because everyone is used to his acting style and he can't really go far out of his way now. Other then that, the editing was bad. Sometimes it did not seem to match the music score. Overall, the movie rocked!",10,2,4,27 November 2003
