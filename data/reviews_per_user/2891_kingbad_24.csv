Walk the Line," Another powerful Oscar contender in the 'year of the biopic'
","Fascinating, music-filled biography of Johnny Cash, this movie really doesn't pull any punches in graphically showing the troubled celebrity's many flaws. From Cash's rural Arkansas childhood with an abusive, alcoholic father, through his meteoric rise to fame as one of the leading lights of country music, to his hard fall due to drugs and alcohol and eventual redemption through the love of a strong-willed, grounded woman.River Phoenix gives a great performance, channeling Cash's powerful bass voice and awkward guitar style- despite his lack of any resemblance to the real Johnny Cash. But the real star of this movie is the amazing Reese Witherspoon, who perfectly captures the on-stage charm and wit of June Carter, while showing the courage and determination of a show-biz veteran. Both stars show their incredible range of talents by doing their own singing and playing, too. Great script, rising well above what lesser talents would've turned into an overly long 'True Hollywood Story', and showing the real heartaches and strength of two great American talents,",9,0,1,23 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious, obscene, groundbreaking
","There needs to be a new word invented for the act of laughing and cringing simultaneously; I propose that we call it Borating. This is easily the funniest movie of the year, probably the funniest of the past several years. It's a cross between the best of the Inspector Clousseau movies and Mississippi Burning, played for laughs in front of a group of completely clueless yokels who never quite get that they're the joke. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, since they're always a letdown) there won't be a sequel; Borat's been doomed by his own success, and will probably never again be able to get away with the stuff he does in this movie. Favorite bits include turning a hyperpatriotic rodeo crowd against him with his own version of the national anthem, presenting the hostess of a ridiculously formal Southern dinner party with a fresh bag of his own feces, and chasing his obese producer through a hotel lobby and into a crowded elevator, both of them stark naked and hairy, after catching the man masturbating to a photo of Borat's beloved Pamela Anderson.",9,1,6,24 November 2006
Unbreakable," Disappointing, muddy follow-up
","Those folks who really liked M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (a preposterous, but well-written, bit of Hollywood claptrap) should've been prepared for the inevitable letdown that any follow-up would produce. However, I was surprised at just how bad this movie would be. Let's face it, nobody grows to late middle age (the shaved head isn't fooling anybody, Bruce Willis!) without noticing that they never, ever get hurt, or sick, and they have super strength!! Granted, his character, David Dunn, isn't exactly the brightest bulb on the string, but even a former football player would get a clue eventually. Of course, that's why he gravitated toward security guard work, right? God knows, maybe EVERY lardassed rent-a-cop is blessed with superpowers (one of which, apparently, is total lack of ambition). And what's the deal with Samuel L. Jackson's character? Was it really necessary to dress him in purple metallic Nehru jackets and the most Godawful stupid hairstyle since Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber to sell him as a supervillain?    Dark, disappointing, and blessed with a dumb and tacked-on 'surprise' ending; let's hope that Shyamalan's sophomore slump has passed, and he can salvage a promising career. Enough with the comic books, huh?",6,0,0,2 January 2001
Memento," Unforgettable
","Truly strange, fascinating film which raises as many questions asit answers. What are we, if not the sum of our memories? Can weever truly know anything? Leonard Shelby is trapped in apostmodern version of Hell, haunted by his last permanentmemory (of his wife, raped and dying) and desperately trying tofind her killer using his 'system' of photos, notes, and tattoos. Themovie takes a great deal more patience than most moviegoerspossess, but with careful study the movie will develop before youreyes like one of Leonard's Polaroids. That doesn't mean you'llunderstand it, though- this is my third viewing, and I'm no closer toa coherent theory of what happened than after the first. It's like avideo Rorshach test- what a person sees in the movie tells a greatdeal about themselves. See it, and tell others what you think- butdon't believe Teddy's lies.",8,0,1,27 October 2001
Troy," Spectacular old-time Hollywood entertainment
","Surprisingly good adaptation of Homer's classic poem, withspectacular sets and great battle scenes. Well-acted by Brad Pitt,Eric Bana, and Brian Cox, although a few too many close-ups of acadaverous Peter O'Toole for my taste.    Director Wolfgang Peterson was able to sneak in a few timelyanti-war messages and refuses to glorify or exploit the extremeviolence of hand-to-hand combat. Despite the large cast, multiplestorylines, and long running time, the movie kept up the pace andengaged this viewer throughout.  Great old-time, 'cast ofthousands' style entertainment.",8,0,1,3 June 2004
Insomnia," Mesmerizing thriller
","Poor Al Pacino can't sleep. An LA cop stuck in the Alaskan summertime, the sun never sets, and his body can't adjust. What's worse, he's being investigated by Internal Affairs, he's just shot his partner to death, and the killer he's trying to capture knows all about it. Great performances by Pacino (the bags under his eyes are so large, they need their own trailer between takes), Robin Williams as the conniving mystery author-murderer, and Hillary Swank as the young local cop who slowly turns from fawning to suspicious. As Pacino's character becomes more sleep-deprived, he begins to doubt his own senses, and so does the viewer (a trick director Christopher Nolan used with great effectiveness in Memento). Well-written, not too gory, and an interesting twist on the slippery slope a cop faces when he fudges the evidence to catch a criminal.",8,0,0,12 May 2003
Capote," The real mystery is the man himself
","Fascinating portrait of an incredibly complex and gifted writer. Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is amazing; despite his lack of resemblance to Capote, he so inhabits the character that it's easily overlooked.What's always mystified me is how such an odd-sounding, fey little man could've infiltrated the homes, and souls, of people so unlike him, especially in the uptight 1950s. The movie deftly answers, by showing how Capote combined wit, the attraction of celebrity, and simple courtesy and kindness to overcome the resistance of clannish Midwesterners and sociopathic criminals. Even as his subject, Perry Smith, learns that he's being played by Capote, and learns the depths of Capote's betrayal of his appeals of his murder case, he still can't help reaching out, even as his time runs out.Powerful supporting cast, especially Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend, research assistant, and literary rival (his petty jealousy over her success with To Kill a Mockingbird is especially telling). She's the only one capable of calling him on his manipulative ways, and the only one capable of seeing past his egocentricity to see the insecure, small man beneath. Bruce Greenwood and Chris Cooper are fine in underwritten roles. But the real revelation here is Clifton Collins Jr., as the doomed murderer, Perry Smith. Collins' portrayal, both sympathetic and vaguely menacing, should certainly earn him an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.",8,0,0,6 November 2005
The Aviator," Shockingly poor biopic
","Overly long, boring, badly acted and directed. Shocking how badly Martin Scorcese has fallen off, after triumphs such as Goodfellas not that many years ago. Leonardo DiCaprio is incapable of playing grown-up roles, as he continues to look like an overgrown infant even as he pushes thirty-something. I'm amazed at the gushing over Cate Blanchett's grotesque imitation of Katharine Hepburn- Frank Gorshin does a better one. And don't even get me started on Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, who was apparently a sexless, anorexic coat-hanger instead of a bombshell (much to my surprise). However, the greatest disappointment by far was Scorcese, who completely lost any semblance of a storyteller in favor of cheesy CGI effects and bogus dialog. Too bad, because Howard Hughes was a truly fascinating subject- a deeply neurotic multimillionaire, plagued by obsessive-compulsive disorder, but also a true visionary and aviation pioneer. This movie doesn't do him justice.",3,44,89,1 January 2005
American Beauty," Vastly overrated
","This is the kind of movie that makes me wonder where IMDBusers' heads are at. Barely well-written enough for a Lifetimemovie of the week, and a lot less plausible. Kevin Spacey hams itup for an hour and a half, and Annette Bening's screeching harpyshould have NOW protesting outside the theaters. Couldn't figureout the appeal of this movie two years ago, and it's even moremystifying now.",3,3,5,4 November 2001
Collateral," Wasted effort
","OK, so I'm buying Jamie Foxx as a repressed, compulsive cabbie. I can even sorta buy Jada Pinckett-Smith as a federal prosecutor with a thing for repressed, compulsive cabbies. But then you throw in Tom Cruise as Vincent, the World's Shortest Contract Killer, and it's just way too much to believe. Director Michael Mann gives Cruise some leftover Don Johnson stubble from his Miami Vice days, and Bill Clinton's hair, but beyond that it's still just 'Risky Top Days of the Last Cocktail' with a gun. Besides choosing Mini-Me as the villain, this movie also has some problems with believability- after all, what kind of hitman is so concerned about leaving witnesses, yet kills just about everybody around in as public a place as possible? What kind of crime boss would bother killing the prosecuting attorney, when there are dozens more in the same office ready to take over? And what kind of cabbie drives a fare all over town, but never turns on the meter? On the plus side, Jamie Foxx simutaneously conveys both abject fear and annoyance with the miniature sociopath who threatens his life while nagging him about his professional and romantic failures. The cinematography is wonderful, showing nighttime L.A. to its best advantage. Unfortunately, Tom Cruise is simply too short to be scary, and his Tony Robbins-meets-Sammy the Bull routine wears thin too fast.",6,0,0,21 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Fascinating, controversial, the anti-Western
","Watching this film at a multiplex was an absolutely fascinating experience. After wading through the crowd of mouth-breathers knocking down the doors for Nicolas Cage's latest 'epic', I was transported (with very few other audience members) to the rapidly eroding Southwest of the early '80s. Much more than simply a chase movie, the Coens (with brilliant source material by Cormac McCarthy) have made a wistful homage to the Texas of an earlier time, when people respected the law, their elders, and each other, even as greed, drugs, and mindless violence begin to overtake the culture. Powerfully acted, particularly by Tommie Lee Jones (in probably the sparest performance by a lead actor in, well, forever) and Javier Bardem as the monstrous Anton Chiguhr, a man who simply embodies menace. A lot of folks, looking for the standard good-guy-wins-bad-guy-loses Hollywood malarkey, will hate this film, particularly the ending. That's OK, though- there are plenty of choices for them. This was a movie for the rest of us; it's a miracle it got made.",9,0,2,28 December 2007
Batman Begins," Missed opportunity
","A movie of grand proportions but few recognizable human characters, Batman Begins is yet another example of modern Hollywood: make it bigger, louder, faster, pricier- and worse. Christian Bale makes an interesting Bruce Wayne, although he becomes a husky-voiced cypher with the batsuit on (but let's face it, anybody's going to look ridiculous wearing a suit of armor, cape and pointy ears). Michael Caine brings an understated passion to his portrayal of Alfred, the ultimate sidekick- although a proper English butler with a Cockney accent is a bit distracting. Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are fine as always; hopefully, though, their much better work in much better movies isn't overshadowed by this newfound success with the popcorn crowd. On the other hand, the movie is burdened with lots of 'what-the-heck-is-this' performances- most notably, Tom Wilkinson as an Italian crime boss portrayed badly by a British stage actor, and Katie Holmes as a grownup (stick with Dawson's Creek, honey). And finally, Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow, a guy with a bag on his head)and Liam Neeson (a guy with a phony goatee nearly on his head), as two of the least threatening movie villains ever. Hey Cillian, nice costume- what's the matter, was your 'scary ghost' outfit at the cleaners?",7,3,7,19 June 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Strange and spectacular
","The most breathtakingly beautiful film I've ever seen (and heard- the music is wonderful). All the best elements of the romance, martial arts, and dramatic genres- with a little bit of Western thrown in, too. Surprisingly deep plot, full of unrequited love, jealousy, and nobility gone awry. Comparing this movie to the standard Hong Kong chopsocky trash is like comparing good music to the Backstreet Boys'- it's just a completely different frame of reference. The flying stunts were somewhat distracting at first, but were more palatable later when seen as a metaphor for the supernatural martial arts (and spiritual) abilities of some of the characters. Truly amazing, strange and original.",9,0,0,16 February 2001
2012," I liked the movie a lot more the first time I saw it
","You know, when it was called The Poseidon Adventure, or Independence Day, or Earthquake, or Titanic, or any of the couple dozen other, much better disaster flicks that 2012 so gratuitously ripped off. The only thing that sustained me through 2 1/2 craptastic hours of bad acting, sadistic and preposterously clichéd writing, and overblown CGI effects was the knowledge that, now that Emmerich has destroyed the planet, he's done in the disaster-movie business. I mean, where do you go from there- Viggo Mortensen blowing up space Maybe now he'll be forced to make movies about real human beings in everyday, real-life situations, with honest dialogue and credible acting...nah, bring on the exploding Martians!!",4,3,7,14 November 2009
The Incredibles," Absolutely incredible!!
","At last, a big-budget, Hollywood movie that's both technically proficient AND a great story! Spectacular animation, both on the main characters and the amazing backgrounds. And most importantly, the animators didn't leave the storytelling behind. Heartwarming plot, engaging characters, and great voice talent made this movie a wonder from start to finish. The audience, both adults and children, left the theater amazed and smiling- a rare feat these days, and truly something not to be missed. Looking forward to a sequel- hopefully not a quick knockoff or a weekly imported TV series, but something with the same degree of care and heart as this treasure. Don't miss this movie!",9,0,0,23 November 2004
Hero," Visually stunning, but ultimately empty
","First, the good news: Ying xiong (Hero) should win all kinds of technical awards for costumes, cinematography, set design, and possibly music (beautiful score, wonderfully performed by Itzhak Perlman). It's simply a beautiful-looking movie, and plenty entertaining if all you're interested in is a series of attractive, unrelated frames of celluloid.Unfortunately, that leads to the bad news: there's no story here!! Or rather, in an aborted attempt to rip off Kirosawa's technique in Roshoman, there are three different versions of the same story, basically hung together as an excuse to have each of the leads fight each other at various times. The dialogue was laughable, the wire work was directly lifted from a lot of other (and better made) martial-arts movies, and the 'gifted' Jet Li manages to run through the entire gamut of emotions, from A to a slightly different A. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!And finally, my primary complaint is with the motivations of the characters here. Despite being highly-trained assassins, and very motivated to kill a megalomaniacal King bent on conquering their homeland and/or killing their families, at least two of the characters pass up an opportunity to kill him? WHY??!! Because he's changed? No- as it turns out, he conquers all of their lands, and sets himself up as the first Emperor of China (as revealed in the postscript). This film glorifies militarism and totalitarianism; as a propaganda tool for the current Communist Chinese government, it must be very popular.",6,0,1,23 September 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Small, beautifully-told, ultimately tragic
","Easily the (latest) masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's directorial career, although, on the heels of Unforgiven and Mystic River, perhaps his best is still ahead. Powerful story of a determined young woman and her over-protective trainer/manager. Eastwood is amazing as the tough but fatherly Frankie Dunn, seeking redemption for some great, but untold, sin against his own daughter. Hilary Swank shines in yet another 'role of a lifetime' as the doomed Fightin' Maggie Fitzgerald, who rises from an awful family life in the Ozarks to become the No. 1 title contender. Morgan Freeman turns in yet another wise sidekick/narrator performance; his role as 'Scrap Iron' Dupri is strong, although not as memorable as 'Red' Reddick in The Shawshank Redemption (of course, any time he's not stuck in another Ashley Judd movie is a good thing). SPOILER ALERT!! A lot has been made of the film's treatment of Maggie's paralysis after being injured in the ring, and her decision to enlist devout Catholic Frankie's help in ending her life. Politics aside, however, her choice was completely in keeping with her character, and shouldn't be taken by advocates for the disabled as some sort of approval of assisted suicide. In fact, Frankie's initial refusal, and agonizing decision to help, emphasized the difficult moral choices involved.",9,3,5,2 March 2005
Garden State," Stunning debut, great movie!
","It's nice to know that honest, heartfelt movies like this one can survive the Hollywood least common denominator system. It'll survive the inevitable comparisons with 'The Graduate', and stand on its own as a story about a young man and his battle with alienation and old memories. Beautifully acted, especially by Natalie Portman (who knew she could act, after all those crummy Star Wars movies?)Zack Braff isn't going to be in sitcoms very long, with a writing and directing talent like his. I especially enjoyed the way his characters had their stories dragged out of them slowly, engaging the viewer instead of just throwing everything in your face. Definitely not for the 'car chase, explosion, fart joke' viewer- but those over age 15 certainly appreciate the opportunity to enjoy a movie now and then, too.",9,0,0,13 September 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Extremely disappointing
","After the first two classic installments of the series, I was hopingthat the third chapter would wrap up all the narrative threads, whilecontinuing the gripping performances and wonderful direction.Instead, this movie was 2 1/2 hours of bad direction, leadenacting, and boring storytelling. Al Pacino's Michael Corleonereplaced the quiet menace of his earlier performances withhammy overacting- proving that 'The Devil's Advocate' wasn't justa fluke, and further marring the reputation of a great Americanactor. Sofia Coppola was simply terrible in a pivotal role- the worstexample of nepotism and directorial hubris ever. Nearly all thesurviving stars of the first two movies wisely steered clear of thisstinker, and Andy Garcia proved that he's no James Caan. Verydisappointing way to end a great series of movies.",4,6,13,18 October 2001
The Departed," Powerful, violent, profane
","Great character study of two young state cops, each leading a double life and trying so hard to keep their deceptions undetected. Leinardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are probably going to be competitors for the best actor Oscar; both gave great performances, DiCaprio in a flashier role, but Damon's controlled intensity was amazing, too. Strong supporting roles, especially by Martin Sheen and, of course, Jack Nicholson, as the most evil guy in the world. I usually find Nicholson to be a distraction, since he's usually called upon to play basically a slightly different version of his crazy-guy role; this time he really submerges into an anything-but-crazy role as mob boss Frank Costello. Savagely bloody, sustained tension; vintage Scorsese, easily his best movie since Goodfellas, and the best American movie of the year.",8,0,0,10 October 2006
Ray," Honest, exhilarating biopic
","This movie does justice to one of the most spectacular American lives of all time. It covers Ray Charles' life from his destitute Florida childhood to his spectacular musical success, without sugar-coating his infidelity, drug use, and sometimes manipulative and tyrannical nature. Jamie Foxx's performance is simply amazing; not merely mimicry of such a well-known personality, but a truly brilliant job of acting. While Foxx is certainly a talented pianist, he and director Taylor Hackford were smart enough not to try to duplicate Charles' unique vocal stylings, and used Ray Charles' actual voice for some of his most famous performances. While the movie of course takes dramatic license with some of the events in Charles' life, it's overall honesty breathes life into its subject, instead of placing him on a pedestal. It's a credit to Ray Charles that he approved of, and assisted with, the screenplay, warts and all.",9,0,1,24 December 2004
The Dark Knight Rises," Greatest villain- the script
","Geez, Nolan, get an editor!! Overlong, preposterous- throw in some Ewoks, and you hit the Star Wars trifecta of suck. Bizarro Batman (aka Bane) was an utter disaster as a villain, but fortunately for Tom Hardy he was in such a ridiculous costume, he'll probably be able to convince people that he wasn't even in this piece of crap. Nice touch bringing Liam Neeson back as the ghost of psychotic Obi-wan; he played a delusion, but was still the most believable character in the movie. Marion Cotillard (or whatever her name is) remains Nolan's muse of special effects laden crapfests, and Anne Hathaway- well, she wasn't terrible, but God, she wasn't very good. Almost makes you miss Joel Shumacher and dumb gay Batman.",5,5,11,8 February 2013
The Truman Show," Better than Carrey's usual, but doesn't live up to the hype
","While it's certainly refreshing to see a movie with Jim Carrey in it that doesn't involve rectal rhetoric and other childish antics, I was disappointed that The Truman Show failed to live up to the extreme ballyhoo that preceded it. Certainly it would be difficult for any movie to shine under those circumstances, but a better effort would've been nice. A simplistic plot that could've been explored fully in a Twilight Zone episode (and, I think, probably was). Intentionally bad acting by Burbank's 'supporting cast' was off-putting, as was the logical inconsistency of the basic premise: that the dreary details of an excruciatingly boring life could be the source of endless fascination for millions of viewers. Certainly enough to make your average Jerry Springer devotee ponder, but for the rest of us, come on!",6,1,2,14 February 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Who knew Homer was this funny?
","Hilarious reworking of The Odyssey, and a great performance by George Clooney as Ulysses (er, Everett McGill). Only marginally smarter than his dim companions, Pete and Delmar (played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson), McGill still manages to talk, stumble, and luck into everything his heart desires. Great score, full of modern reworkings of American blues and bluegrass standards, and beautifully photographed. A real pleasure- I'm looking forward to the Coens' version of The Iliad.",9,0,0,23 January 2001
