The Blair Witch Project," Truly Terrible
","Everything you've read is true - The Blair Witch Project is horrifying, is terror inducing, will chill you to the bone. For the last two minutes of its 90 minute running time. These last moments are shot at breakneck speed, with little dialogue and the green glow that comes from using a video camera at night. If this part of the film was made into a five minute short it would be looking at an eight or nine out of ten. As it is, the rest of the film is so mind-numbingly awful that it's one of the few films I've given a one.This is not because of the cheapness of the film - cheap was the only real option for a film of this type, and picture quality should have no bearing on how good a film is. It's not because of the basic story - which is actually quite a good idea for a film. No, what really does The Blair Witch Project in is the terrible execution and annoying acting. During the day the three leads wander around a forest shouting at each other. At night they hear a tiny little sound then run around in the darkness screaming. And I'm talking complete and utter darkness. All there is consists of darkness and screaming. It's boring and not scary at all. And it goes on like this.Do not, under any circumstances, pay to watch this film. Wait until it's next on television and just watch the last few minutes. It's for your own good. Because not everything you've read is true - there will be no screaming in the aisles; only from the speakers. For what will seem like an eternity.",1,2,5,27 April 2003
Alien 3," Not as good as the others (as if you need telling)
","After the brilliant Alien, and the maybe even better Aliens, what was the obvious progression? That's right, Alien Cubed. That's something of an optimistic title though, as this is certainly not Alien to the power of three. Actually, the only real problem with Alien3 is that everyone involved in it, with the exception of David Fincher, Sigourney Weaver, H.R.Giger, and maybe Charles Dance seems to be completely useless. The acting is (with the exception of the above) uniformly awful, truly dreadful. The clunking dialogue is not helpful to their cause.Fincher does a decent job with what he has to work with and his past in music videos doesn't make the film too flashy and disorientating. Particularly impressive is the scene with the alien's point of view while it runs along the ceiling. But the whole film is let down by the disappointing visuals. Where the first two films had darkness and dinginess, or just sheer scale to impress you with, Alien3 just has a rust coloured prison planet that looks like something from Dune. Only worse. This is the downfall of the film - if the visuals had been better, the films other many bad points could probably have been ignored.",6,395,412,23 May 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Extended TV show with added music
","That sums it up pretty well, but what it doesn't express is that South Park actually manages to sustain the laughter over the length of an entire movie, something most TV-to-film adaptations fail. And although its critics will point to the incredible amount of swearing and other questionable situations the movie involves, what they miss is that this is actually far more intelligent than most movies aimed at the teen audience. After all, what better way to frame a satire on censorship than in a film completely packed with bad-taste moments?South Park also marks a return to the musical genre of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's other brilliant movie, Cannibal! The Musical. The songs are actually very well made (I think one of them has a musical background) and anything that spoofs the awful, staid songs of traditional musicals is in my good books. If you're a fan of the TV show you've probably already seen this; if you're not, then I'd suggest ignoring all the negative publicity and giving it a go. If you can get past the foul mouths you might be suprised.",9,0,0,8 May 2003
Armageddon," Worse than you might be expecting...
","To be blunt - Armageddon might just be the worst movie I've ever seen. It's a horribly cynical cash-in, with every facet of the movie designed to maximise its profits amongst movie goers looking for a 'summer blockbuster'. Even more than most films of this kind. There's the utterly shameless flag waving attitude (topped off by the drunk Russian astronaut), there's the endless cliches you can see coming a mile off, there's the obligatory romance, there's the fact that they never stop playing that bleedin' Aerosmith song (*cough*nepotism*cough*), and there's the fact that, shame of all shames, Steve Buscemi's in it but it's still crap. How can you put Steve Buscemi in a film and still make it devoid of all and any value? The answer - make Armageddon, a film which is never, ever going to even approach respectability.Avoid. Avoid as if your life depended on it. Please.",1,1,4,8 May 2003
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Masterpiece
","While trying to remember them off the top of my head, every other Spielberg film I've seen (with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan) has been an over-sentimental crowd-pleaser. If you think about it, Schindler's List could well be accused of the same - it's all perfectly designed to tug at the heartstrings (especially the modern-day section at the end) and I've certainly never met anyone with a bad word to say about the film. The difference, the thing that makes Schindler's List different from all those others, is that no amount of schmaltz could diminish the power of Oskar Schindler's story.Schindler's List is not a lyrical, wistful treatise on the horrors of war. For the most part it is a bone-crushingly upfront recounting of the personal and collective horrors faced by the Jews during the Second World War. Some of the more violent scenes are reminiscent of the opening from that other Spielberg classic, Saving Private Ryan. The difference is that while many of those in Saving Private Ryan became soldiers and put themselves in the line of fire by choice, the people in Schindler's List are innocent of any crime and absent of any choice. The indiscriminate killings and attitudes of most of the Germans, and particularly Amon Goeth (played excellently by Ralph Fiennes), chills to the bone, as does the well known appearance of the little girl in the red coat who provides one of the few splashes of colour in an otherwise aptly dark and dour film.Oskar Schindler himself makes a transformation, from cold-hearted factory-owner using the Jews to make money into a man so disgusted by the crimes of his fellows that he puts his own life at risk to save others, that is so obvious and predictable that it should feel contrived. But it doesn't. And I have no doubt that there are other glaring faults throughout, but it would take a crass mind to even notice them, let alone write them down. The power and scale of this film (the amount of extras used is unbelievable, like one of Eisenstein's films) are the things that win out, and will continue to win out for generations to come. If Spielberg is remembered for just one film, it will surely be Schindler's List.",9,11,16,18 March 2003
The Piano," Haunting
","The actual plot of The Piano is a very straightforward love triangle, the only difference being that one of the three is mute. To recap it quickly: Harvey Kietel gets naked; Holly Hunter gets horny; Sam Niell gets mad; then Sam Niell gets less mad. What does make The Piano stand out somewhat are the brilliant visuals. The outside action takes place under a web of grey tree branches obscuring the downcast sky. The whole film makes a far more disturbing use of the New Zealand scenery than the over-hyped-but-pretty The Lord Of The Rings.The Piano reminds me quite a lot of Japanese horror film Onibaba. The actual stories of the films are poles apart, but both have a feeling of detachment. Until the very end of the film you could be forgiven for thinking that The Piano is set in an alternate universe, so far away are the characters from any other humans. This love triangle is completely isolated, and from start to finish there is no possibility of any outside forces interrupting or for any of the characters to escape. It is this quality, along with the desolate landscape of the film, that give The Piano it's quality. Plus, the music's great.",7,0,4,6 May 2003
Black Hawk Down," Pointless
","The fact that Black Hawk Down has such a high rating here has thoroughly depressed me. Surely anyone can see straight through this storyless, action packed jingoistic mess? Apparently not. Never mind, they're going to keep making films like this anyway so I suppose it doesn't really matter. Anyone reading this before watching the film needs to know just one thing: this film is exactly the same as you are expecting it to be. So if non-stop action, minimal characterisation and a lot of flag waving are your thing, Black Hawk Down will also be your thing. If you are more partial to films with a story, or at least some kind of depth, avoid it like you probably were already.",4,0,2,8 May 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Pretty horrible
","The first hour or so of Girl, Interrupted is watchable, if more than a little flawed, but by the end it self-implodes quite spectacularly into an obvious and over sentimental end. It's major problem is that all the main characters are self obsessed rich girls. Very few of them seem to have any real mental illnesses, especially Winona Ryder's character. This would be acceptable if the movie showed that the doctors diagnosis was nothing more than psychobabble, but it doesn't. In fact, by the end of the movie, Ryder is 'cured' of a disease that she never even seemed to possess.Angelina Jolie's character is portrayed as the bad girl, although she's clearly the only one there who has any acceptance of the situation she's in. And at the end, all it takes is a few well chosen words from Winona Ryder to break down the defenses she's supposed to have built up over a lifetime, and she realises the error of her ways. And Ryder's own ending is just as sloppy - a nice, happy, farewell. All of this is at first set against a backdrop of the Vietnam War, which promises to show the contrast between those being drafted to fight and the pitiful, selfish girls in the mental hospital. But that suddenly gets dropped halfway through, and the war is hardly mentioned again. It's a shame that the story itself is so ideologically contemptible because the film looks nice and the acting is superb, but that's just the way it goes sometimes.",4,1,2,25 April 2003
Rocky," Better than Raging Bull
","OK, that's not strictly true, but it grabbed your attention. And while Raging Bull is most probably a better piece of film art than Rocky, it's the latter that holds the title in the enjoyment stakes. And although Rocky is essentially one great big cliche, as Appollo Creed says: 'A lot of other people are just as sentimental'. And it's true, we are. And Rocky manages to stay just the right side of sentimental to stay charming rather than mawkish.Stallone's script is surprisingly effective for someone who later wrote Cliffhanger and who is traditionally painted as nothing more than a set of muscles and a mumble. However, Stallone's actual acting ability leaves much to be desired, and it takes Creed's rearranging of his facial features to shift his one expression into something else. But it can't detract from the fact that Rocky is extremely enjoyable hokum. It may not quite be what I think of as a deserving Oscar winner (maybe the competition was weak that year), but it is certainly more than worthy of the praise it receives from my action film loving friends.",8,0,0,10 May 2003
Three Colors: Blue," Overrated navel gazing
","*****Some spoilers*****I was actually expecting to like this quite a lot - although I hadn't thought much of Three Colours White I decided to give the series the benefit of the doubt and continue persevering because I had heard so many good things about this installment. It seems this was a mistake. Three Colours Blue is exactly the kind of film that action loving Hollywood film fans so gleefully laugh about. After a promising opening it becomes very slow and very little happens throughout. This is probably because it concerns a woman coming to terms with the death of her husband and daughter in something approaching complete isolation, but that's no excuse for making something as thoroughly uninteresting as this. Things do start to liven up a bit towards the end with the introduction of the husbands secret lover, but this is topped off by possibly the most horrible closing scene of any movie ever - it seems to start with Juliet Binoche having sex in a glass box full of water, then goes through a roll-call of all the characters looking thoughtful and deep. Overall, while this is far more ambitious than Three Colours White it does not pull off a success. Sometimes you have to drop a little bit of the subtlety to include something an audience can actually enjoy and engage with.",5,23,40,13 May 2003
The Deer Hunter," Good but overlong
","The Deer Hunter - which the people on the Deer Hunter message board will happily tell you is not about war, in case you hadn't noticed - is in parts a very moving film. But at other times it tends to outstay its welcome by a long stretch. Particularly responsible of this is the opening wedding scene, which sets the scene, introduces the characters, tells us that they're going to Vietnam, shows us how mentally unprepared they are for the horrors of war - and then carries on doing so for what seems like an infinite amount of time. Scenes like this will doubtless put many off the film, and that's certainly a shame.Another possible problem is that Robert De Niro actually doesn't appear to have been changed by the war to any great extent, bar the odd meaningful look of sorrow. While Christopher Walken stays in Vietnam, and the other guy ends up in a veterans hospital, scared to come back out, Bob still seems like he did before. This, along with their incredible length, somewhat dilutes the power of the non-Vietnam scenes, which is a problem when they're supposed to illustrate the main point of the movie. Nevertheless, The Deer Hunter is both an emotional and iconic movie which will be remembered for some time to come if only for the numerous Russian Roulette scenes and the chilling ending of Walken's character. If you can ignore the long running time then you should definitely give it a shot.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
Kagemusha," Disappointing
","I am a big fan of Akira Kurosawa, and it has to be said that even Kagemusha, the worst Kurosawa film I have seen so far, is miles ahead of most current Hollywood cinema. But overall, this is something of a disappointment. Although the story itself is not bad, and it is all filmed majestically, the editing and pace of the movie is far too slow. The full version is almost three hours long, when the American version is way too long at only 2.5 hours. This really is the only gripe about the film, and if it were shorter it would be worthy of an 8 or 9 out of ten. As it is, this is not recommended unless you have a lot of patience.",6,14,25,22 February 2003
