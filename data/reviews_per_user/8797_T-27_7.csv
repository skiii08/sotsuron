United 93," About that last comment
","The contradiction between the plane being in a nose dive and the passengers being impeded in their progress froward to retake the plane was more than just an indication, it took up the whole scene. Once you notice the flouting of the laws of physics, you still have several minutes to sit there and think 'doesn't anyone realize that this is impossible'.It is a great movie none the less.In the families special feature one relative syast that she is glad the movie was not Hollywoodized - I am to - made for a much better film. I think there should be a lot less Hollywoodization in all historical, biographical and non-fiction films.",10,1,3,9 October 2006
Casablanca," What's wrong with me!!!!!!
","Because it has been so highly praised and has been included in or on top of so many ten best lists, I have tried to watch this movie several times. I get so bored I cannot stand it and cannot watch for more than a few minutes. I gues there is a first time for everything but I simply cannot get into Casablanca.",Null,0,3,18 June 2001
Casablanca," what's wrong with me??????!!!!!!!!!
","Because it is so highly rated/reccomended and becasue it is always on so many ten best and hundred best films lits, I have tried to watch this movie several times. Each time I get bored to tears in the first few minutes - so bored I can't stand it. Well, I gues there is always a first for everything.",Null,0,1,18 June 2001
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Just like a television news interview
","What struck me the most about this movie was how much it reminded me of a black and white television news or court room interview from the 1950's and 1960's. Several times I had to remind myself that this was NOT a pseudo-documentary in that vein. Then it occurred to me that, having been made in 1928, it was before the advent of television,so this bonus effect had not been planned. Of course seeing it on video on an actual television must have added to the effect. The spare, largely blank gray background and closeups of Joan concentrated ones attention on her and heightened her personal pain, dread and tragedy.For me this was a new treatmernt of with new insights into the Joan of arc story.",8,2,4,21 July 2010
Van Helsing," good - but Bela Lugosi and Johnathan Frid better
","First of all let me admit I am a big fan of the Universal classics from the 1930's - nobody can do Dracula like Bela Lugosi. And its not just the performance of one particular actor, its plot, characterization and atmosphere - genuine 'spookeyness'. Actually no modern horror movie has truly satisfied me except Bram Stoker's Dracula. Van Helsing was OK - I expected great. If they are going to MAKE a movie like this - go to all of the trouble, effort, money, why not make a GREAT one. (I say the same for Troy - good movie, should have been GREAT!) The Frankenstein monster was a nice touch, but he rest was too much window dressing - too much flash, too many things flying around. And some of the plot twists, the secret world behind the mirror and those squishy eggs left over from Alien.     Real horror movie cliche's are great, but not overworked things like mad chase scenes, squishy eggs complete with the same sound effects, things like that which work in one modern horror or science fiction movie but get old when worked to death in every horror or science fiction movie. Since seeing Van Helsing I have been watching Dark Shadows on video and after VH appreciate DS so much more. Now there is acting, plot, sets, mood, costume - ATMOSPHERE. Just goes to show you cannot beat a two hundred year old vampire discovered chained in a coffin tn the family tomb who authentically redoes the ancestral home and kidnaps a beautiful local girl to turn into his lost love.",Null,0,1,7 August 2004
Moulin Rouge!," This should go under Trivia AND movie connections
","The Hindi song featured in the Indian musical within a musical at the end is Chama Chama from the Bollywood movie China Gate. Chama Chama is a show stopping song and dance number.The second song was of course the Marily Monroe classic Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.This should be a trivia AND a movie connection, but I could not place it there, so I am putting it under comments.Maybe IMDb could put a user submission trivia link, even links in other features for the movies.It is also difficult to correct more than one misspelled word per submission.",7,2,2,11 September 2007
The Mummy Returns," Trivia
","I may be wrong, but I thought I saw something  at the begining of the scene in the British Museum. Several mummies in cases are lined up along the wall. The first one, perhaps all, were in the exact pose as the Mummy in the Boris Karlof classic original, the Mummy as found in his coffin.",Null,0,0,14 May 2001
