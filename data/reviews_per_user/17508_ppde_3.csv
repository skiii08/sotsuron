Howl's Moving Castle," Wonderful Imaginative story & scenes
","Every magical spell was different, imaginative or to spell bound. And the story has a soft thrill to it. Ending is not a fantastic closure plot. But it was good enough to have a wonderful ending.
Don't think of the war happening among cities in it, though the story revolves around the war but it has no significance in story",8,0,0,19 April 2020
Joker," Just one man steals the show
","Who else could have played it better? What Joaquin portraited was sensational. What he showed on screen was nerve rattling, act was fantastic as good as it could be for any known best performance.
Though something was pulling the whole package down, for the movie to be top notch. Joaquin put on a tragic victim scene, a person rotting/broke down by system in Gotham city, but story didn't reflect much of it. Why did he had to kill 3 people? Can't get enough empathy for his actions. The whole story theme was in trailer.
Having said this, I still want to see it many times, see the Joaquin act again. Something is still captivating about the JOKER that makes it such a great movie to watch",10,1,1,7 October 2019
Green Book," A minute ago I finish watching this movie.. and I loved it
","Subtracting the racist angle, which is sure for any movie to shout, I found this movie entertaining, touching, brilliant. The portraying of Tony Lip is marvellous. The skills he put in acting, the character he played sure would have been not easy.
Scenes after scenes we are reminded of two people handling injustice or rather racism.",9,0,1,10 December 2019
