Requiem for a Dream," Most brilliant told story within modern film?
","This might just be the best film i've ever seen. At least the best directed one. There are so many people looking after just joy or the feeling to be entertained by a movie. This movie has the focus on the theme. Getting caught up somewhere in between drugs and the American dream. I like all the elements that are used. The cinematography - that really paints a picture of how the general emotions are with the characters. The way the film uses the months as simple symbols of the direction in the developing of the film. All the actors are so real. I believe in them constantly. And that makes the movie much more realistic, and that again makes the message the movie is trying to send out even clearer. If you dare watch this movie a little bit open-minded it should take your attention pretty good! Because there are so many of us that are just like the character of Ellen Burstyn - Slaves of entertainment. Watching television, all the fun. This movie isn't fun, and it should not be judged for being 'dumb' or 'boring'.It is a very subjective movie from the director/writers point of view, and that is what makes it so real. The objective movies that are most more general, with less feeling, doesn't speak as loud as this movie. To make such a movie takes guts and deserves big attention. Some of the point is that as the movie runs we start to care more, and more for the characters, and that is what makes the ending so good (Without spoiling anything). Something i have managed so see in all Aronofsky movies i've seen is the great power of that hug between to characters in the climax of the whole film. I could really end saying: 'Nothing is as emotional as a good hug in an Aronofsky film!'",10,0,1,23 August 2012
