Miracle," Mighty Ducks Replica?
","Although an excellent movie about the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team, this movie is, for the most part, a remake of the Mighty Ducks. MD is about a hockey team that must disregard its differences to pull together and win themselves an Olympic title. In D2, the US Hockey team is pretty good, but must take on Iceland. (Even the coaches look similar form Russia and Icleand) In spite of all this, however, i am a forever hockey fan, and must give this movie a 7.0, just above average (have you seen any of the guys' bodies???? (lol))",9,0,0,11 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best Picture of the Year-by far
","Lord of the Rings return of the king comes to an action-packed, heart-wrenching end in this awesome Xmas flick. This Xmas, in case you didn't notice, many flicks premiered around the 25th, and this one exceeds them all as far as acting, directing, special effects, and excitement. LOTR will sweep the Oscars this year. There is something definitely wrong with the world if Peter Jackson doesn't win the Oscar for Best Director.",10,1,2,15 January 2004
