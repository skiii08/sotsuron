The Blair Witch Project," Avoid at all cost!
","Oh, my. I wasn't overly enthusiastic when I saw the trailer for this one, and I avoided it at the theaters. I'm glad I did, because it was absolutely appalling! I was really in the mood for a chill when I began watching BWP, but I soon started yawning. And there was no turning point, it just got worse and worse!  First of all, what's the point with this movie? To scare, would be the only possible answer (apart from making dollars). Well, I wasn't the least scared more than a few moments. The rest of the time was just a plain bore, and the climax of the movie is actually a big anticlimax. What about the script? Was there one, or was everything made up as they shot the movie? The lines were certainly not believable, and the actors didn't add anything to their roles. No soundtrack deepened the atmosphere, and the visuals were uninspiring; how many minutes of the movie were completely dark? Actually, I can't find one good thing to say about BWP, and that doesn't happen to me often. Even the Critters are more scary. This is a dull, tedious and unimaginative movie that should be avoided at all cost.",1,2,4,3 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great start for the saga
","As a die hard fan of the Star Wars trilogy, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of Episode 1. Now I've seen it, and I'm neither disappointed nor blissed. TPM is simply a good movie, especially for those of us already hooked on the SW world.The Swedish critics have, like critics in other countries, given TPM some really bad reviews. What they seem to miss though, is that TPM is a very 'SW' movie. It has all the ingredients of the former films, and therefore it is a worthy addition to the SW world, as well as a great piece of entertainment. But for some people (namely critics), this is not enough. I can stretch it as far as saying that this (i.e. copying the concept from the three former films) makes TPM the weakest in the saga. It could have been more innovative in this respect.Some observations:Sweden's biggest daily wrote that none of the actors are any good. This is completely false. In fact, most of the actors are as good as you would expect (come on, this is SW!), I was especially impressed by Jake Lloyd as Anakin. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast for his role, though it would have been interesting to see more sides of his character. Ahmed Best was great as Jar-Jar Binks, a character who managed to keep the movie from getting too serious.The special effects were fantastic. Not one time was I distracted by the fact that so much in TPM is digitalized. Instead, it enhanced the movie.Again: the original trilogy was better, but TPM is a great start for the saga, and it makes me sincerely long for Episode 2.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,20 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An optimized end to the trilogy
","It seems as the common opinion concerning the Star Wars trilogy is that the third and final episode, Return of the Jedi, is not only the weakest in the series, but in fact a rather mediocre film. I've heard the arguments, and I agree that some things, such as the dialogue, are better in - for instance - The Empire Strikes Back. But I´ve never understood why the fantastic qualities that this movie actually has, aren't surfaced in the debate.
What´s so good about ROTJ, then? Well, I must concede that my opinion might be based more on emotions than plain facts. What I appreciated in ROTJ when it came was perhaps most of all the incredible imagination it was built upon. For instance the first part of the film, which takes place in the castle of the villain Jabba the Hutt. The environment, the characters, and the incidents taking place there were all mind-boggling and awesome. And I still give the movie much credit for those scenes. Most of the special effects in ROTJ are - still today - simply incredible. Especially those in the speeder bike scenes, as well as those in the final space fight, which makes the scenes in A New Hope pale by comparison. Effects alone doesn't make a film great, but in ROTJ they help a lot.As a whole, the plot in ROTJ is a bit weak. What does work, though, is the wonderful build-up towards the inevitable fight between Luke and Darth Vader. The tension can be felt throughout the film, culminating in some fantastic scenes on the Death Star, when the Emperor shows his potential as a manipulator and persuader. He certainly embodies evil. The last 30 minutes or so of ROTJ is one of the most intense and fascinating sequences I´ve come across in a film.So, what is ROTJ most often criticized for?  I´ve overheard that the film is impersonal and illogical. Also, some fans dislikes the death of the popular character Boba Fett, as well as Yoda´s death. Another impopular scene is the one where Luke removes Darth Vader´s helmet. And then there are the Ewoks, the perhaps too cuddly bears living in the forests of the Endor moon. To me, those scenes perfectly portray the David and Goliath theme: size isn't all that matters. But sure, some of the criticism above is valid. Just don´t judge the whole film by that! Because ROTJ is a magic trip into another world, a fantastic spectacle, and an optimized end to the greatest film trilogy in the world.",10,2,5,25 March 1999
Groundhog Day," My favorite comedy!
","Bill Murray in a tour de force performance as the cocky weather man Phil, who gets to learn a thing or two about humility. Phil is initially a rather tragic man, lonesome and unhappy with his life, which shows in his satiric and disrespectful attitude towards people. This is also the case with his work, for instance when he must cover the festivities around the groundhog day in the small town Punxsutawney. But fate has had enough, and an unexpected snow blizzard forces Phil and his camerateam to stay one more night in town. The next day, Phil experiences deja vu: he's stuck in yesterday! From now on, he goes through a series of transformations, ranging from bliss, to megalomania, to utter despair, to resignation, and finally: empathy.Bill Murray's contribution to this movie is immense. His mimic and body language alone is enough to make you laugh, and a wonderful script is the icing on the cake. Groundhog Day is a movie with a lot of heart and a great atmosphere, and it offers many laughs as well. I must have seen it about ten times by now, and I'd rank it as my favorite comedy.Rating: 10/10",10,3,5,4 March 2000
The Truman Show," A miracle
","(Warning: might include spoilers!)At first, I wasn't especially interested in seeing The Truman Show. I thought: how can a movie starring Jim Carrey be any good? After all, he made The Cable Guy one of the worst ever movies. Little did I know that Carrey would contribute in making The Truman Show one of my all-time favorite movies!Truman Show has one of the most nuanced and subtle scripts I've come across. The story simply nails you to your seat. Directing is brilliant, thanks to master-director Peter Weir, also responsible for the stunning Dead Poets Society. Here, Weir re-creates the world in which Truman Burbanks lives and is being (involuntarily) filmed 24 hours a day. Peter Weir actually places us there, on the spot next to Truman, shares us Truman's feelings and thoughts.We laugh as he laughs, and we cry along with him. Towards the end of the film, we sense Truman's despair and hopelessness deep inside of us, even though we already know all about his situation. The reason for this is that Weir manages to make Truman represent mankind. Truman could be any one of us.The Truman Show is a movie playing on many levels at once. It has humor and drama. It concerns our need for entertainment and reveals an increasingly shameless media-industry ('the first channel to adopt a child.'), as well as  man's fight and struggle to break out of tediousity and distress; basically   our need for freedom.There are so many details here: the pin with the words 'how is it going to end?', the various ways Truman is being kept at Seahaven (the preventive posters at the travel agency has to be seen to be believed)... And notice how Christof falls forward at the end, as if he had lost everything, even his own life, the very moment Truman gained his.Acting is flawless. From the 'acting actors' - Laura Linney as Truman's wife and Noah Emmerich as his best friend Marlon - to Ed Harris as Christof, along with Christof's companions. Harris carries out a truly awesome performance, he steals every scene. And finally: Jim Carrey is magnificent as Truman   Burbanks (from the Burbanks galaxy : ) He does everything right. He is goofy when it's called for, and genuinely moving and emotional at other times. I can't think of a better actor to portray Truman's everyday life.I've seen The Truman Show six times now, and I will buy the home video cassette and put it on my shelf. This is an utter perfect movie, and one of my five favorite movies of all time.",10,0,0,30 September 1999
