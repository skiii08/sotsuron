Moneyball," Thoroughly enjoyable
","Even for someone like me, who doesn't have a clue about the game of baseball and has no interest whatsoever in going to watch the game, this film holds a lot of interest. Certainly, don't dismiss it because you don't like big sports.The theme is one that I have contemplated over the years: the ridiculous sums of money that are paid to players of any team sport, simply because they look good, whilst players with talent, but noticeable human faults, are nudged to the sidelines. Is sport only about appearances or is it about striving to be the best at what you do?Brad Pitt plays a refreshing, real life character, who leads the team of leftovers and 'losers' to victory, despite the overwhelming opposition of everyone else who just don't understand the maths and mechanics of trading, of gambling, of statistics and true sportsmanship.You won't regret watching it, unless you detest Brad Pitt's dimple.",8,0,1,5 January 2012
Drive," Mindless violence and weak - Definitely not about driving!
","I really enjoy watching both Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan, but I was thoroughly disappointed to see them in this film.Firstly, I expected an edge-of-the-seat thriller with lots of car action. The little bit of car action that was included was actually quite silly, with over the top engine noise and Ryan Gosling driving an indestructible car at the end. Secondly, the violence was way too detailed for my taste. If you enjoy watching someone's brains being mashed, then grab your popcorn and beer and enjoy! Did the producer have shares in the fake blood supplier and 'gruesome noise' maker?Thirdly, the plot was OK, but the story dribbled out in erratic fashion and just when you think something is going to happen ....it doesn't.",2,3,6,29 December 2011
