The King's Speech," The worst film to ever win Best picture at the Oscars
","i dunno why people like this film. i felt it was terribly written, awfully acted, hammy as hell, horribly shot - those unmotivated use of wide angled lenses and horrible framing. awful, boring film. just a talky stage play and not a very exciting one at that. one of firth's weakest performances. see him in 'fever pitch'. they just didn't create the 30's convincingly. i guess the weinstein muscle can win anything an Oscar nowadays. how they sold this lemon to the entire academy is mystifying. David fincher and 'the social network' were robbed, that was actually a film and not a verbose play posing as a film. i can't remember one visual device in the entire film that was interesting.",1,13,40,23 January 2012
The Departed," sexual inadequacy
",the theme of sexual inadequacy which is explored in departed is very interesting - Matt Damon and Vera farmiga have one scene early on where she asks him ' you wanna talk about last night... its OK guys tend to make a big deal about it' ' they don't say it explicitly but when she meets Leo later she says the relationship with her boyfriend is having ups and downs. later on in the porn theatre Damon seems uncomfortable with the movie ( someone on screen at that point has an enormous erection -we hear it don't see it) and through the film also he keeps trying to act macho and sexual..when Alec Baldwin talks about weddings in the golf scene and says ' weddings make the world realize you aren't gay and that your **ck is working ...' Damon responds ' yeah no problem . its working overtime' ... which is obviously crap coz we get no suggestion that he and Vera farmiga have an active sexual life. this is also interesting coz we only see her sleeping with Leo. also makes the scene where jack Nicholson attacks him with the strap on dildo interesting coz thats what Damon's struggling to get -- an erection. also when Vera farmiga is asking him to talk about it she has a very erect banana in her hand...... i know I'm reading a lot here but why else would she be holding a banana.... also in the immediate next scene she and Leo are talking about 'guys using their weapons ',9,1,3,19 August 2007
