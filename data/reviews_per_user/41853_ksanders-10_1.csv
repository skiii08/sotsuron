Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," High Five it's Borat
","I have never been the greatest Ali G or Borat fan, however, I have strangely been looking forward to this film for some time. I think due, in part, that's it's at least original in an otherwise poor summer of movies. Went to see a screening this evening (opening night in the UK) and it was absolutely packed. I don't think I have heard so much laughter in a cinema auditorium. I cannot recommend this movie enough. It will make you laugh and it will make you cringe. It's going to be a huge hit across both sides of the Atlantic and deservedly so. In fact I bet there will be many who will go see it twice to take friends or indeed witness for a second time what they couldn't believe they saw the first time round. I have never seen a cinema audience stand and applaud a movie before at the end credits. Excellent, High Fve!!!!!!!!",9,4,12,2 November 2006
