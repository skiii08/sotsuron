Walk the Line," Thumbs up for a love story which turned out to be a labor of love from cast and crew
","'Walk the Line' is definitely one of the best biopics I've ever seen and one of this year's best films. In my opinion,its major breakthrough is that it appeals to all audiences- even to the European one which isn't familiar with country music or Johnny Cash in particular. I am Greek and even though my knowledge of country music is limited, I absorbed every detail of the film and I even rushed to buy the soundtrack! Biopics are a dangerous genre in the sense that it is always very difficult to recreate a person's life in full length and in full depth; yet James Mangold was wise enough to concentrate mainly on Cash's early adulthood and especially on his beautiful love story with June Carter. He managed to capture the essence of their relationship, approaching it from all sides without being tiresome or boring; and with the help of a really inspired cinematography by my fellow Greek Phedon Papamichael and with T-Bone Burnett's amazing contribution in music, Mangold made a really moving and unforgettable film. My comments, however, would be incomplete if I didn't mention the two 'pillars' of the film, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. When I first read about 'Walk the Line' in Premiere magazine I thought that the two would make an unlikely pair and I questioned their chemistry; R.Witherspoon is adorable but she had starred mainly in very 'light'films,which didn't require great talent, whereas J.Phoenix is one of the best actors in American cinema, but there is also sth dark, morbid and disturbing about him. Yet I was curious to see the outcome, and I confess now that I stand corrected! There was an undeniable chemistry between them and they truly seemed to have been born to play their roles. And, of course, I bow before their courage and determination to take this huge risk and responsibility to perform the Cashes' songs, especially J.Phoenix who would be instantly compared to the legendary Man in Black.( Mind you, I like 'Ring of Fire' by J.Phoenix more than by J.Cash!) I always considered J.Phoenix a very talented actor who has made excellent and diverse choices, sth which proves the vastness of his gift as an actor and I must admit that I was in awe when 'Walk the Line' was over. What a performance! He displayed a rare sensibility and he rendered Cash's complex personality both when he was fragile and when he was strong with great empathy and respect. I would say that Phoenix submerged into Cash's soul, he intuitively understood who he was and, thus, he masterfully portrayed him. I believe that Phoenix, in some peculiar cosmic way, was J.Cash during filming. Phoenix proved himself as a great actor once more in this film, because he was able to balance effortlessly and beautifully between the profoundly wounded child and the unfulfilled man that J.Cash was. It was truly a shame that the Academy deprived him of this year's Oscar for Best Male Leading Role, because he was the one who lifted the film on his shoulders, the one who gave it its sparkle and above all, he is the one who transcended his personality and became the Man in Black!P.S. I saw the movie on Febr. 14th,it was a coincidence and I think an unconscious tribute to a really moving love story. Also, because of 'Walk the Line' I sought a different way of creativity and I've taken up acoustic guitar lessons.",10,4,7,8 April 2006
