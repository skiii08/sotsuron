Ford v Ferrari," Great Ride of a Movie
","Matt Damon has to be one of the most underrated Hollywood actors of his time, yet, time and again, he gives exceptional performances, whether they be as quirky characters, the butt of a joke or a straight up dramatic role. This film is no exception. The way he and Christian Bale play off against each other is remarkable to watch. You don't have to be a car fan to like this movie but if you can imagine yourself sitting in the seat of these exceptional machines you will ride every curve and straightway of this movie. It is fun. It is well performed. It is well written. It is great personal drama. I give this movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {True Life Drama}",8,2,3,10 December 2019
The Avengers," Top of the Line
","I don't know how this could be any better. The whole team coming together, each a standout contributor, and add to that Joss Whedon. Great characterizations, performances, tone, CGI, action, humour, interpersonal interaction. Just the top of the line in its genre. I give this film a 10 (at its best) out of 10. {Marvel Action Adventure}",10,0,0,17 March 2019
First Man," A very slow and quiet movie about a very private man.
",A very slow and quiet movie about a very private man. Great performances from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. The technical aspects of this movie were the standout elements - very worthy of the 4 Oscar nods. My guess is that it will pick up a Sound Award. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Bio-Event-Pic},7,0,0,30 January 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Where do it go wrong? Let me count the ways.
","Where did it go wrong? It had a solid cast, all noted for being great performers, but it all felt horribly miscast. The story began all wrong, in a frenzy, skipping everything that would have developed characters and established relationships. It was like walking into the theatre 20 minutes late, you feel you've missed something important. The CGI was excessive and the human stories were undeveloped. And, I can't help but think that this didn't fare so well being released within months of a Marvel movie that was as well made as IRON MAN. Even in these rewatchings, I watched them chronologically, which just heightened the disparity. I'm disappointed to give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. (It didn't even have an after credit scene - sub par). Well, at least I know that a better incarnation of the Hulk was resurrected for subsequent Avenger movies. {Superhero Action Adventure}",6,0,1,14 March 2019
Iron Man 3," Interesting turn about
","Great cast (Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow always give the bedrock for the tone and the heart of the writing). Ty Simpsons' role was a nice addition. Lots of action. CGI could be a little chaotic at times. Interesting turn about, having the story telling more focused on the evolution of the man than that of the machine (although, there was an abundance of machines). The end credits are very 1970s. Even in rewatching, I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",8,0,0,17 March 2019
A Star Is Born," This was a good movie but not a great movie
","This was a good movie but not a great movie (this will not be a popular opinion). First the good stuff: Lady Gaga was perfect for and in this role - acting singing, chemistry, song writing - all fantastic. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Gaga was believable and, at times, breathtaking. The first two thirds of the movie had a great arch and captured us (as a friend, who watched the movie with me, said, 'I could watch the first part of this movie on repeat.') I am also a big fan of about 5 of the songs, and would add them to my library without hesitation, they are beautifully written. Now, the not so good stuff: the last third of the movie was too long - it could easily be cut by 20 minutes, but Bradley Cooper, as director, was more than a little self indulgent with his own scenes (we got the struggle, drawing it out didn't serve the storytelling). Ally's character arch was disappointing. As her star rose she didn't learn to love what Jack saw in her. She didn't learn to take ownership of her own story, the very gift Jack was trying to give her. Ally's story wasn't resolved until the very last moments of the movie, it was eclipsed by Bradley's directorial obsession with Jack's decline, belying the original premise of all the STAR IS BORN movies and lessening her triumph. I guess what moved it from great to good, for me, was that the first two thirds proved it could be great but the last third got hijacked (no pun intended). I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Music-centric Romantic Drama}",7,1088,1525,6 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," By far, my favourite Star Wars.
","By far, my favourite of the Star War movies. Great CGI. Epic soundtrack. Human stories. Great performances. Many wonderful cameos. Heroism at great cost. The power of hope. This was my second viewing of many more to come. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",10,10,12,21 February 2019
Captain Marvel," A really good movie
","Undaunted by reviewers and critics, alike, who were giving the movie a 6 out of 10 when the day began, I (with adjusted expectations) ventured out to see this movie which I had highly anticipated. I thought it was really good. I wonder, if I had not adjusted my expectations and gone to see it, still seduced by the advertising hype which led me to believe this would be Marvel's challenge to WONDER WOMAN (which I have now seen 3 time and gave an enthusiastic 9 out of 10), would I have felt let down (as it seems others felt after the opening night). Perhaps. But, having been cautioned by early opinions, I found the story to be clear cut, the performances to be solid (Brie Larson was spectacular), the Marvel humour to be fully present and appropriate to the tone of the characters and the special effects great. In my ad hoc exit poll (OK, more like casual chats with others as we exited the theatre) I found others also enjoyed it. So, I am giving this film an 8.5 (really good) out of 10. So, I say. Go see it - let it stand on its own merits - and I think you'll like it, too. {Superhero Adventure}",9,1,4,8 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Still worthy of a rewatch
","Sequels are always disadvantaged when they follow a particularly strong 1st edition so this one had a high bar to jump. It may not have gotten the gold but it definitely placed a silver. Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow held their ground and set the tone (which we all enjoy). Mickey Rourke was a credible villian. Scarlet Johansson was a bonus addition to the Avenger Universe, premiering the Black Widow. And, the S.H.I.E.L.D. regulars (Jackson and Gregg) didn't miss a beat. Good writing. Always glad for these rewatching opportunities. I give this film an 8.5 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",8,0,0,15 March 2019
The Notebook," A perfect movie
","This is a perfect movie. I am not alone in my affection for this movie (although it is ranked 5.3 by the critics at Rotten Tomatoes and Megacritics, the viewers rank it 7.9 in Trakt and IMdB and Rotten Tomatoes viewers give it an 8.5), so there must be a few of us who feel like this. Do you think critics become too battle weary to see things with the wistful hope of improbable optimism? I'd forotten how young Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling were when they made this movie. These two young Canadians won our hearts as they perfectly inhabited their characters. Their young love was filled with enthusiasm and life, yet, James Garner and Gena Rowlands beautifully displayed love, long lived. I love the writing, the performances, the locations and the music, that haunts us, even after the last scene fades. I'm a romantic that still dreams of endings such as this. I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Romantic Drama}",10,1,2,27 March 2019
Knives Out," Thoroughly Entertaining
","Absolutely delightful. You don't have to be a Miss Maple or Hercule Poirot fan to enjoy this movie, but it will let you in on the inside joes. This whole script is written and performed with its tongue firmly in its cheek. It is a wonderful parody with a great cast. It acrobatically delivers its twists within twists. Thoroughly entertaining. I give this film an 8.5 (delightful) out of 10. {Mystery Parody}",9,3,8,10 December 2019
The Irishman," A Masterclass in Filmmaking.
","A masterclass in filmmaking. Scorsese hits all the bases like he wrote the rules of the game. If you are a little concerned about starting a movie that is 3 hours and 29 minutes long (as I was) I can only tell you that it is worth the time. The cast is spectacular as are the performances. Scenes were given time to breathe and find their own internal tensions, yet, there was no lag that would lose the audience. The storytelling doesn't let you down. The attention to detail is noteworthy. This movie is worthy of it's accolades and awards. I rate this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Historical Crime Drama}",9,0,1,9 January 2020
About Time," A Perfect Movie
","A perfect movie. (I've said that twice this past week as I've revisited some of my favourites films.) This is more than a love story about blossoming love (Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams), there are a wide variety of love stories in this, not the least of which is that of a father and his son (Bill Nighy and Domhnall). Lovely supporting cast. Great performances. Beautiful and textured writing. Exceptional music. Life affirming moments and profound words side by side with the humour of life. I've watched this many times (and even, accidently, bought two digital copies). I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Unconventional Drama about Love}. As a matter of fact, I think I'll watch it again, right now.",10,1,1,30 March 2019
Aquaman," Unremarkable
","The origin story was interesting if predictable. The acting was uneven: Jason Momoa was the rough and tumble guy we expect from him. Amber Heard's acting was really poor, even her line delivery was very amateurish. Nicole Kidman was perfect in her role. The one remarkable feature of the movie is the beautiful underwater CGI, which was magical (if overly fond of jellyfish). I give this film a 7 (good but unremarkable) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",7,1,2,1 January 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," A Nine Year Old's Rave Review
","I introduced my AAR* to the creative genius of Hayao Miyazaki's Ghibli Studio, today, by taking her to see MY NEIGHBOUR TOTORO, which was her first Japanese Anime movie. Here is her review (warning, it has some mild spoilers, which I shall note):I think this movie is a 10 because it is a great movie! I liked all the parts but my favourite part was {spoiler} when the older sister found her younger sister{/spoiler}. That was very happy. It had some scary and sad parts but {spoiler} it was all happy at the end {/spoiler]. I really liked the two girls, the main characters.

Thor: Ragnarok," Really, Really Good
","Really, Really Good. After two misfires, they finally got the tone right - lots of fun. Big action, big story, great cast (a superbly ripped Chris Hemsworth) good mix of heroes (I missed Lady Sif, though, but hopefully she escaped the slaughter and will show up in the next movie), convincing villain, twists and turns, stellar CG, entertaining, spot on humour. Even after a rewatch, I give this a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",9,3,7,21 March 2019
The Prestige," Both a Natural and Supernatural Mystery
",Both a natural and supernatural mystery. One might expect one but not the other. Excellent cast. Great premise. But the reveal was both anticipated and obscured as the lines of the genres were blurred. I'll leave you to figure out this riddle. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Mystery Drama},7,1,1,10 April 2019
The Terminator," A Complete Surprise
","In 1984, a movie came out that I thought I would never be the least bit interested in. I went to see it because my youth group was talking about it and, as their Minister of Christian Education, and their youth leader, I was always interested in interacting with them about the media they consumed so I could challenge their worldview with the cause of Christ. I was completely astonished to fall in love with the love story that was, surprisingly, at the heart of this weird, mechanical, apocalyptic movie. It became one of my favourite movies and I've seen it multiple times since then and it still moves me. That movie, of course, was THE TERMINATOR, a straight up 10 out of 10. {Pre-Apocalyptic Love Story}",10,1,3,4 November 2019
Ready Player One," A Feast for Nerds
","Clever. Funny. Adventurous. Just a great movie for everyone (maybe a little terrifying for young children). The writing is brilliant. Movie, SciFi, Literary, Pop and Gaming references from every era. Old people will think the kids won't get the references. Young people will think it is only for their generation. But they will both be wrong. There are so many Easter Eggs in this that it would take an encyclopedic endeavour to point them all out (and I'm sure the true nerds will give it a try). Great and complex CGI. Good performances. I give this movie a 9 (superb) out of 10 and encourage people to see it on the big screen in 3D with popcorn. {SciFi Adventure}",9,0,0,25 February 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Beware fiction masquerading as fact.
","This is a good movie. It is important to throw a spotlight on our cultural flaws and ingrained pre-judgements of each other. Otherwise. how will we overcome them? It is a good story, incredible in its root in reality. The cast and their performances were good (with the exception of Topher Grace who was horribly miscast). It had some unexpected treasures, like Harry Belafonte as Jerome Turner who mesmerized us with his testimony of brutality. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. Does its subject matter alone elevate it to Best Picture (it is nominated in 5 other categories for Oscars, as well)? I'm not sure. MINI RANT - In an age when popular understanding of history is based on the movies people see, I think it is important to point out that if a movie says it is based on actual events, as when a movie says it is based on a book, there is a lot of artistic license taken to shift details around and changes made to make it a good movie, even to the extent that the film is more fiction than fact. I'll give you just three examples from this film, it is based on the 2014 memoir BLACK KLANSMAN by Ron Stallman. The writers moved the story back seven years (1979 to 1972) to facilitate a reference to a number of blaxploitation films. David Duke didn't find out that Stallworth was black until 2006 (27 years later) when called upon by a reporter to comment on these events. The detective who is characterized as Flip Zimmerman was not Jewish, that is a total contrivance of the film. Two other Oscar nominated films, also saying they were based on actual events, THE FAVORITE and MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, are really fiction far from fact. Beware fiction masquerading as fact! END MINI RANT. Fun Fact: Stallman still carries his KKK membership in his wallet. {Crime Drama}",7,0,1,31 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A lot of fun
","This movie was a lot of fun. Tom Holland was a convincing 15 year old, and I'm so glad the film makers gave this a high school context rather than a 20 something concept (don't get me wrong - I loved the romance of the Toby Maguire movies, but this younger version was refreshing). I loved the buddy plot. It was good to see Michael Keaton playing a villain. There are some stellar additions to the supporting cast and I appreciated the cameos from a few of the characters from the Marvel universe, and of course, Stan Lee, himself. This was a good time and great adventure. Upon rewatching, I'm going to bump up the rating to a 9 (terrific) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",9,2,4,21 March 2019
The Polar Express," Still a Perennial Favourite
","When this first came out in 2004, it was considered to be cutting edge, innovative technology but to a modern audience it looks rather plastic and artificial. What we now know as motion capture animation was then called performance capture. I remember seeing this for the first time and it was a wild ride of animation. Perhaps, because of Tom Hanks performance in multiple roles or the story of a young boy's restoration of belief in the magic of Christmas, it is still a perennial favourite, POLAR EXPRESS is still delighting audiences of all ages. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Seasonal Family Animation}",7,0,1,10 December 2019
The Best Years of Our Lives," A really good movie
","A really good movie which garnered many well deserved awards, including Best Picture. The story is well written, telling of a difficult time in post-war America from the perspective of three returning servicemen reuniting with their families. The acting is wonderful. Harold Russell, who was from North Sydney, Nova Scotia, is the only person in history to have won 2 Oscars for the same role, as well as having the shortest film career for an Oscar recipient (3 movies). This classic is well worth finding and watching. I give it a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Post-War Drama}",9,0,0,2 January 2019
Closer," Perfect performances
","WOW! I don't care for the premise of the piece but it gives a platform for a masterclass in acting. As I was watching it I thought how it would make a great play, and afterwards I discovered it was, at first, a play in which Clive Owens had been in, on the London stage.. The stellar cast must have been drawn to the depth of the characters and the emotional range they would be demanded of them. Their performances were spectacular. The acting deserves a rating of 10 (perfect) but the situations and the morality of the characters did not resonate with me, so I'm giving it a 7 (good) out of 10. {Adulterous Drama}",7,2,3,4 August 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More than an action movie.
","Great movie. This has a strong and complex plot - S.H.I.E.L.D / Hydra. Nice meld with TV series. Great cast with great performances. Great relationships and character development. Nice backstories for the new additions. Great villains, Robert Redford in an unusual role, but always a solid choice, and the twist with the Winter Soldier, although a bit predictable, mined the heart of the story. Even on a rewatch, I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",8,0,2,18 March 2019
Doctor Strange," The limits of suspended disbelief
","This was the most difficult of the Marvel Universe, for me, in which to suspend disbelief. When you take away a base line of reality, the whole universe has no stability or consequences, thus no dread, thus no failure. It's like with Doctor Who, if the sonic screwdriver can diagnose and remedy any problem, there is no adventure. This movie lies too close to that edge. I also felt the horizon shifting contortions were too abstract to imply real danger so the action became hollow for me. Although I give it points for CGI concepts and executions. There were excellent performances, Benedict Cumberbatch (with a flawless North American accent, no less) and Tilda Swinton are excellent performers and Rachel MacAdams can ring romance out of a dish cloth. Even upon rewatching, I give this film only a 7 (good) out of 10. {Sorcering Superheroes Action Adventure}",7,2,4,20 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I'm stepping past the polarized reactions...
","I'm going to step right into the fray here. Dyed in the wool fans are hating it, while, at the same time, it is being criticized for pandering to long time fans. Honestly, how could J.J. Abrams win? My perspective is that of a lover of movies. I've seen all the blockbuster SciFi films over the years, I know all the Star Wars films and have enjoyed some more than others, but I didn't come to this film with a pony in the race. I came to see a good finale to a landmark series, with good story telling, characters to invest in, some new novelty worlds and characters, solid performances, spectacular CGI, and a proper send off. I found all these things. The film was super busy with lots of information and special effects coming at you all at once (I really should see it again to catch it all). Outstanding moments for me were: the way Carrie Fishers' footage, shot before her death in 2016, was woven into the film (her legacy was honoured); spectacular special effects; imaginative creature creations and world building; how the storyline came full circle for both the heroes and the villains; the epic, internal struggles of Rey and Benjamin, and the way that struggle was resolved; and, I loved the themes of hope and fraternity. In short, I enjoyed this movie. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {SciFi, Classic, Adventure, Action}",8,3,9,21 December 2019
Ant-Man," Missed the mark
","This will not be the popular opinion. This movie just didn't work for me. I think it started to go wrong for me with the casting: Paul Rudd is not a favourite of mine, mostly because he goes over the top in his comedy (he may be going for endearing but he lands at silly), which was just amplified in Michael Pena's role; then, there was the lack of personal dynamics. How did they mess up letting Evangeline Lilly do what she does best - good, heartfelt, emotive performances? There was no chemistry with any of the relationships (except maybe with Ant-tony). The villain was mundane and barely threatening. Otherwise, the CGI was creative and dynamic, the potential of the bare bones premises are still there. It just fell flat for me. I can't give this film any more than a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",6,1,1,19 March 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Great Stuff!
","Beyond all the Rah-Rah America (kinda goes with the name), this is a great movie, even on this revisit. Good performances (great cameos from some of the UKs best up and comers). Great story. Great relationships. Great action scenes. Great CGI. Do you catch where I'm going? I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superhero Action Aventure}",8,0,0,13 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Brilliantly written and performed
","I don't know how much of this is fact and how much of this is fiction but this is a tremendous, brilliantly written movie. Full disclosure, I was a folk girl, not much interested in hard rock, and that predisposition kept me from even wanting to see this movie. Then it was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, so I took a deep breath and watched it and I'm not sure I ever had a chance to exhale. Dare I say, it completely took my breath away! And gave me a new appreciation for the music of Queen and the talent of Freddie Mercury. Rami Malek was brilliant. Allen Leech (far from Downton Abbey) earned our scorn. Lucy Boynton completely created the steadfast dedication of Mary Austin. No one is more surprised than I, but I give this movie a 9 (superb) out of 10. Nominated for 5 Oscars and I predict it will win 3. {BioPic Drama}",9,2,2,31 January 2019
Bird Box," Good (if not great)
","I didn't know what to expect, but with Sandra Bullock as the headliner, I was curious enough to watch (it turns out she was also heavily involved in the whole production). And, I wasn't disappointed. This was a good (if not great) movie. Sarah Paulson shines in everything she does and Trevante Rhodes executes leading man gorgeously (even if the 24 years age difference is noted). The plot was interesting, even though I found a couple places a little flat (gauging how much time is needed to build tension is a delicate thing - sometimes they overestimated). So, we have THE QUIET PLACE where voices are dangerous, with this we have sight being the danger. I'm interested if they can do the same for taste, touch and smell. I'm giving this movie a 7 (good) out of 10. {Apocalyptic Thriller}",7,0,3,11 January 2019
North by Northwest," Movie Making at it's Best!
","Movie making at it's best! Where to start? Hitchcock spun brilliance. Stellar cast, phenomenal performances: Cary Grant never misses a beat, James Mason is ruthless, Martin Landau is menacing, Leo G. Carroll obfuscates, but Eva Marie Saint is the fulcrum of the piece with her powerful, skilled, nuanced performance, perfectly balancing confidence, vulnerability and passion. The cinematography is vivid. The colour is glorious. Hitchcock at his best (did you catch his cameo?). Of course I rate this film a 10 (the best) out of 10. {Mystery, Intrigue, Suspense}",10,1,2,27 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Disappointing
","Disappointing. I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?). I hoped for a better story and entertaining character interactions but I was disappointed. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Marvel Animation}",5,44,130,15 December 2018
The Lego Movie," Not interested in a sequel
","If you were a Lego builder, you might like the imaginative take on your own imaginative endeavours. If you are a pop culture junkie, you will like the wide variety of characterizations. If you are a movie fan, you won't be disappointed by this cast and their voice work. I think the movie deserves props for its CGI, creative visual imagination, pop culture characterizations and voice work. But I felt they overreached trying to turn 'You Are Special' into a transformative moral and I found the cutesy factor wore thin as the movie dragged on. I watched this in preparation for its sequel, which opens later today, to see if it would be worth seeing in a theatre. It fell a little flat for me and there was nothing there to interest me in a sequel. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Adventure Animation}",6,0,1,7 February 2019
Captain America: Civil War," A mini-Avengers movie or a Captain America movie?
","A moral dilemma. Friends or foes? A good mix of premises. This is more of a mini-Avengers movie than a Captain America feature but that doesn't diminish it, quite the reverse. With their very existence affecting the larger world, it seemed right to stop and take a look at the implications of the epic battles of superheroes vs super villains on the world at large. The cast is a dream. It was a great opportunity to introduce Black Panther and Spider-Man (I'd forgotten what mad skills Spider-Man brought to the fight). A lot of dialogue for this script but the action scenes were a good balance. Even on rewatching, I give his movie an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}",8,0,0,19 March 2019
Yesterday," Mixed reviews
","I've read the reviews, this film is getting a love-it or hate-it reaction. First, I think a lot of the bad press comes from people judging it out of its genre. It is a romantic comedy, so those who gave it 1s and 2s (out of 10) because it was 'just a love story with music', need to adjust their expectations, appropriately. Secondly, this is under-spoken, self-deprecating British humour (that I adore) but this is often baffling to American audiences (who are use to being fed broad comedy, charicatures of life - see note on Kate McKinnon, below) and this fuelled another flurry of low ratings. So, you can see where my review is going. I loved this movie. The love story was inevitable (it WAS the point of the movie). The premise was unique (and it provided a great reoccurring joke). The theme of Friendship Zone vs Romantic Interest was executed perfectly by the deep, emotional vocabulary of the performers (although, the 14-seconds-that-changed-the- world is as much of a leap as Lily James, made average with fuzzy hair, being left in the friendship zone, in any time line). Himesh Patel made a smooth transition from the Soaps to the Big Screen and his musical skills were perfect for this. Lily James brought such vulnerability, energy and strength {spoiler} dealing with unrequited love {/spoiler}. As much as I appreciate the comedic talents of Kate McKinnon, I wish she would find the real people behind her charicatures. She needs to find her dramatic chops which, I believe, are there to be discovered. But the glue for this film was the music. As with BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, I was transported to my youth when so much of this music was imbedded, word for word, note for note. {spoiler} I fully expected the ending to flip back to Jack waking in his hospital bed, having lived a dream, and now seeing Ellie with different eyes and not missing his moments, cue same ending from there on. {/spoiler} I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. My friend gives it a 9 (just short of perfect). {RomCom around great Music}",8,0,1,3 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A step down from INFINITY WAR
","After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, 'Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc.' I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}",8,10,22,30 April 2019

Where the first was on a simple scale, though creative, colourful and musically superb, as it told the origin of Hiccup and Toothless's bond, this one is busier: loaded with new A-list voice talent, expanding the dragon culture and is even more colourful. But, what it added in scope, it lost in simplicity and intimacy of storytelling. Also (and not necessarily a bad thing) there seemed to be a shift in the character artwork and it felt akin to TROLLHUNTERS, which was also a DreamWorks production. Still a really good movie but, in my opinion, not quite as good as the original. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Animated Family Adventure}",9,0,0,10 May 2019
The Favourite," Superb acting in a fanciful tale
","Superb acting by the three principals - Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. This is a decidedly unflattering account of Queen Anne's reign frivolously disregarding timelines (Queen Anne's husband was alive during much of this movie's fractured timeline) and embracing gossip (about Anne's lesbian predilection that is disavowed by most historians). The rise and fall of Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hills influence as favourites, although a reality, had other credible political motivations. Much of this movie paints a picture of an ineffectual culture of fops and frivolities in court life, whereas the politics and the principles of the time were a lot more serious and calculating, as was Queen Anne's legacy (the United Kingdom was birthed under Anne's reign). But, as a fanciful history, there is great humour and tragedy in this movie and the acting is truly superb. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Costume Comedic Drama}",8,5,12,9 January 2019
The Little Mermaid," A classic that gets a little lost in translation
","I rewatched this film with two young girls and their mom, who had never seen this Disney classic (How did that happen? Well, two of them hadn't been born when it was released in 1989). This was a film of it's time in production, character and acclaim. It set the stage for a resurgent series of highly successful animated features from the Disney Studios with it's beautiful animation and it's lively tone. It reflected a 'princess' culture that would be a hard sell in our 2019 understanding of the hopes and aspirations of young girls. It introduced some unforgettable characters and was a template for future Disney characterization mixes (princesses, larger than life villians, loveable sidekicks, scene stealing attendants). And, it garnered a lot of critical acclaim, winning Oscars for Original Song 'Under the Sea' and Original Score for Alan Menken ('Kiss the Girl' was also nominated in Best Song category). On my first viewing in 1989, I probably would have given the film a 9 (superb) out of 10, but it didn't weather well, for me (it just hit some cultural dissonance with me). This time, but I still give it a 7 (good) out of 10. So, for an overall rating I'll split the difference with an 8 (great). {Animated Musical Feature}",8,0,0,4 November 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Don't know how it could have been better!
","A great job at what could have been a big mess. So many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, such a big story arc to be told in one movie (Ok, the rest is to be told 26 April 2019, but they covered a lot of ground in this one). Things that caught my attention: great performances by all the cast, real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. Laugh out loud lines. A real threat demanding great cost. Spectacular success for the Russos in a Herculean endeavour. Just really well done! On a rewatch, I bump up my rating from 9 (superb) to 10 (I don't know how it could have been better) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Advenure}",10,0,5,22 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Boring or Disrespectful
","My first reaction was, 'Who is the audience for this?' Manson, Helter Skelter, the Hollywood of Sharon Tate are almost in the forgotten or unknown history of anyone under 40. Will the audience pick up the subtle establishment of these historical characters? Unless they go to the theatre prepped with the significance of the dates, will they know the context of the plot. If they think this is a movie about the fading trajectory of Hollywood careers, they will find the plot very slow and plodding. If they are knowledgable enough to know the Sharon Tate's story, they may feel the weight of the inevitable hanging over the whole piece, but, even with this stellar cast and a pervading anticipation of doom, this movie spends a lot of time on nothing. Personally, I think the cheat at the end is not a good enough payoff for the 161 minutes. The acting is good enough for a 6 (fair) out of 10, but Tarantino come close to boring us to death or, worse yet, disrespecting the victims of a shocking evil. {Criminal Dramedy?}",6,37,62,2 August 2019
Aladdin," A Guest Review
","Today, I have a guest opinion for my review, my companion for this movie, 9 year old, Sophie. Her favourite part was that everything turned out all right in the end and everyone was happy. She felt it was a little scary but not too scary for her, although she felt someone littler might have been really scared. She really liked the Princess Jasmine, liked Aladdin and thought the genie was funny. She thought the music was good and thought people might like to hear it over and over. She gave this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Adventure Musical}",8,1,2,8 June 2019
The Lion King," Two perspectives: a nine year old and a (significantly older) year old
","{Once again I cede my review to my AAC*, nine year old, Sophie.} Sophie told me: This and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO are my favourite movies this year! I had heard that THE LION KING might be scary for anyone under 10, but I wasn't that scared (although I was a little scared, especially when things jumped out on the screen). I liked the way they made the animals talk (it would have been boring if they hadn't). I thought the last part (the fight on the cliff in the fire) was very exciting. There is a lot of singing. Most parts are happy and some parts are a little sad and scary. If you love animals, this will be a good movie for you. I give this movie a rating of 10 (the best) out of 10.(*Age Appropriate Critic)Thank you, Sophie. I'll add my two cents, now. I went into the movie with a little caution. This had been my mother's favourite Disney animated movie so it was going to be tricky emotionally, missing Mom and hoping they didn't mess it up. In some ways this was a different movie. They had to switch up some of the story telling to facilitate the difference between animation and live action. They added a couple of songs and of course the voice talent was all new. The highlights of the movie, for me, was the beautiful photography and the ambient soundtrack, which were so artfully intertwined. They also had the added problem that the real violence of nature had to be retrofitted for a young audience. I'm not sure the 'circle of life' speech Mufasa gave Simba would have registered with the young audience and the violence that is inherent to life (and death) of wild creatures is hard to assimilate with cute cubs, personified chums and beloved characters, so it was confined to our heroes killing and eating non-character bugs and grubs. The exciting ending, of which Sophie spoke, I found to be a little long and drawn out. But, all in all, I thought it was a good movie. I will always prefer the original but give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Young Adventure}",7,0,0,16 October 2019
A Quiet Place," Never has silence been so brilliantly written
","Full disclosure - I am a wimp. I do not do horror flicks because my imagination is so much more terrifying than any movie can reproduce and even the trailer clips of this movie were terrifying. But, I was also intrigued, and it was nominated for an Oscar. I am so glad I took a deep breath and steeled myself to watch this. This is brilliantly written. The performances were totally captivating and the sound wizards were on their A-game. At one point, in the midst of all the painstaking quiet, there was a noise in my room and I involuntarily reached out to silence it, so as to not be heard. For other wimps, it is the tension that grabs you in this movie, not blood, gore or even the monsters but the slow, sheer build up of intense terror. Well done John Krasinski et al. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. (Now I'm going to quietly go hide under my covers.) {SciFi Thriller}",9,0,1,11 February 2019
Meet Joe Black," Top pick on so many of my lists
","I wore out my VHS copy of this movie and lent out my DVD copy so many times, it's amazing it found its way home. It is on my Favourite Movies of the 1990s list, my Movies Watched Multiple Times list and my Movies to Watch Again list. Now, it is one Netflix, where I just watched it for some uncountable time. This movie plays romance beautifully. It takes its time. Anthony Hopkins performance is stately and rich. I truly believe that this movie would have fallen short if it had not had Claire Forlani's performance of vulnerability and soulful longing. And, then, there is a young Brad Pitt, a strikingly handsome, beautiful man. He was criticized for his wooden portrayal but they missed the point. His acting was on point as he moved seamlessly from an idealistic young man facing a new life that was full of possibilities, to the embodiment of a dangerous and isolated entity seeing life for the first time through its beautiful vulnerabilities. The supporting cast is excellent. The music is perfect. This film is always a straight up 10 out of 10, for me. {Drama, Fantasy, Romance}",10,0,0,5 July 2020
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," The birth of a studio that changed its world
","This is the very first Hayao Miyazaki's feature of Studio Ghibli. To see where it all began with the knowledge that this would be seminole moment, makes this a marvellous experience. In a theme, to be oft repeated in his work, we see a world on the edge of an apocalypse, depending on man learning to live within his natural bounds rather than destroy it. And, a young girl who elevates her society by her bravery and compassion, all with a natural, girlish charm. This first work was based on a serial, graphic novel (manga). There is great scope in his artwork. His love of flight is infectious. His characters are alive and vibrant. I found there were times the plot was so diverse that the pace was compromised, but this film was a seed of the skill that became Ghibli's hallmark. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Animated Adventure}",8,0,0,4 November 2019

1917," An Incredibly Personal Movie
","This is an incredibly personal movie. Everything in the picture is designed to make you an intimate witness: the writing, the performances, the cinematography, the editing (or lack thereof), the uniqueness of all the exteriors which never repeat, and it is incredibly effective. You find yourself holding your breath as the action plays out. The seed of this film came from the stories Sam Mendes heard his grandfather tell of his time as a message courier in the First World War. The partnership between Mendes and cinematographer, Roger Deakins, to create the movie as one long shot is award worthy and completely elevates the film above its genre. It's not just a war movie, or an action movie, or a thriller, or a drama. It's all of this things, and more. A truly intimate experience, I give this film a rating of 9 (superb) out of 10.",9,7,10,13 January 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Perfect
","From the very beginning, you know this movie is going to break your heart. Based on a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, with screenplay by Takahata, this is Studio Ghibli at it's best. Beautiful animation. A full and poignant story. Equisite detail in character animation. A wonderful pairing of music and theme. I can't think what would have made this film better.

","Just a whole lot of fun from beginning to end. Add a soundtrack to keep you dancing; great lines, like 'I'm going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.'; an endless string of punch lines and so much more. Thoroughly unique and enjoyable. Mining the pop culture of the 80s and its music. So unlike the rest of the Marvel Universe you'd think it inconceivable that they will join the Avengers Infinity War, but they did. Acting was just right. CGI was a riot of colour. Just well done. I don't know what would have made it better. Especially on rewatches, I give this film a 10 (just right) out of 10. {Space Heroes Action Adventure}",10,0,0,19 March 2019
Cold War," There is just something about this movie...
","There is just something about this movie. On one hand, it is slow, plodding and dark. On the other, there are moments of beauty, heart and an unfathomable passion. Basically, it is the intense love story of two people (reputedly the author's parents) that spans 15 years and transects Europe. From the very beginning the character Zusa emerges as the axis upon which Wiktor's world revolves. No matter where he goes to escape oppression he cannot escape Zula's hold over him. It is impossible to take your eyes off Joanna Kulig as she inhabits this character or to escape the spell she weaves. This is fine acting. The choice of a black and white palette suits the mood of the piece while the life of the music shattters those bounds. Not a movie for everyone but there was something about it that captured me. Nominated for multiple awards, including 3 Oscars in 2019, it has been well received by film critics and festivals. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Dramatic Love Story}",7,1,2,4 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A multilayered saga
","This Avengers is more layered which makes it feel longer and may cause the restless to loose interest but the transitions are well placed, paced and contain some poignant moments, deepening the story. The cast just gets more star studded, all bringing great performances. Joss Whedon is just the best at crafting his stories and because he is such a fanboy of his subject we get lots nice little touches, like the machine (Ultron) that needs an audience (first the Twins and later the Black Widow) and the twist on who is worthy to weld Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer). The stop action montages are beautifully crafted (I wanted to say they are 'rad', but I didn't want to be accused of age appropriation). There is a wonderful balance of big grand moments and nice little personal moments and still the trademark wit that sets the tone. Although my least favourite of the Avengers combo packs, upon rewatching it still comes close to the bar. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10 {Superheroes Action Adventure}",9,3,4,19 March 2019

The first of a great trilogy. Creative, unique and colourful. The music is perfect. Just all round perfect entertainment.

Castle in the Sky," Even a lesser work of Studio Ghibli is still a masterpiece
","I'm awaiting my AAC (Age Appropriate Critic, 9 year old Sophie)'s review of this, but I will put in my two cents, while I wait. Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli, changed the world of Anime. It's influences transcended the borders of Japan, and even Disney, a company as American as apple pie, borrows the brilliance of Ghibli. Miyazaki captures both the imagination of a child and the subtle nuances of movement and response unique to childhood. Often the times of greatest brilliance are things happening in the background. Miyazaki waste neither frame nor background character. CASTLE IN THE SKY has all that quality. I watched the version with an American voice cast and the performances were good. The story took awhile to reveal itself, although it began with rapid paced action, which rather set the slower pace for the story amid a plethora of brilliant animation, imagination and characterization. To paraphrase a fellow commentator, although it is not one of my favourite Ghibli story, the lesser in world of Ghibli is still a masterpiece. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Adventure Anime}",8,1,1,23 October 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," All sound, no value

It lost any of the charm of the first movie and left us waiting for the noise to stop. Its target audience has to be pubescent males for whom women are only a means to an end. Sad. So much money spent on stuff of no value. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",5,1,4,30 December 2018
The Holiday," Too much hysterical hyperbole
","I remembered this as a better movie than I found it to be when I rewatched it. What may be my bias away from RomComs and towards RomDrams might have been the filter that lowered my rating. Romantic Comedies seem to root the comedy in hysterical hyperbole and the first 35 minutes of this movie is exactly that (I was not amused) but after those initial scenes there are some great moments of Romantic Drama (which I liked) that finds the core of it's comedy in people confronting the unexpected consequences of their life choices. Jude Law and Kate Winslet bring more rooted performances but I think the hyperbolic tone of the film was a directorial choice, so even they were pushed to the extremes. I also wondered if the roles were cast to highlight stereotypes of Yanks and Brits. Good acting smooths off the harsh angles of stereotypes by filling out the characters, which is what great performers do. Jack Black is always better than I expect him to be. Not a bad movie but more so a fair movie with nice moments. I give this film a 6.8 out of 10. {Holiday RomCom}",6,1,1,24 December 2018

","This is a wonderful movie, not necessarily because of the subject matter (it's a difficult theme handled sensitively) but because of the careful. nuanced writing and superb performances (it was nominated for a Golden Globe in almost every dramatic acting category (as well as best picture, screenplay and soundtrack) and will probably stir up Oscar attention. Noah Baumbach is an incredible talent. (Just an aside, his work reminded me of another auteur of note these last couple of years, Greta Gerwig, and I was interested to discover that they have been partners in other projects). I will be paying more attention to his projects, from now on. Scarlett Johansson never misses a subtle distinction in a script, and her performance was flawless. But, then again, this was true of most of the cast. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama}",9,6,9,9 January 2020
Black Panther," Beautiful People, Beautiful Production, Poorly Written
","Beautiful people trying to save a paradise. First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, 'throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!' This character's ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society. So I hope you won't be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros. I believe there is inspiration in seeing people, who look like you, behaving nobly, and, so, I am glad to see a movie with a talented black cast telling super human stories. The acting was good, the CGI was spectacular as were the action scenes. The cast had many superstars, (British Martin Freeman, our token white person, playing a rough, tough CIA operative was remarkably convincing). I enjoyed the action adventure of the movie and the world it created. Beautiful people, beautiful production, adventure, action, inconsistent writing - but, on rewatching, despite the Oscar nod for best picture, I can only give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",7,1,3,3 February 2019

Gwyneth Paltrow plays his perfect match. Superb in every sense - tone, performances, action, CGI, tension in the plot and the establishment of the Avenger/ S.H.I.E.L.D relationship. Even in this second viewing, 11 years after its release, it hasn't lost a beat. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",9,0,0,14 March 2019

But, if your interested in a story behind the action, or characters who have depth and aren't just created for cheap laughs, or human heros that manage to show maturity rather than hysterical tantrums, then you, like I, will find this a waste of time.

First, I'd issue a warning that about the violence, unfortunate word choices and uncomfortable life situations for consumption by young audiences. This was unexpected, so I spent quite a bit of time surreptitiously observing my 9 year old viewing companion for adverse reactions. We also had a good debriefing conversation on the way home from the movies. I feel confident that I did not return her to her parents scarred for life (once again >phew<). Apart from those concerns, both she and I really enjoyed the movie. The artwork was superb, the characters were well drawn, the action was fast paced, the suspense was compelling, the voice talent was superb. Truly, is there another studio that surpasses Ghibli in its field? I give the film an 8 (superb) out of 10. {Anime Adventure}",8,0,0,18 November 2019
