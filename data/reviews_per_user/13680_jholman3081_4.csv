Hereditary," Classic creepy horror
","No snacking, no comfort breaks and lights out because this one requires your full attention from start to finish ... and it is so worth it.
Brilliant performances all round with a cracking storyline elevate this movie alongside some of the all time greats of the genre (The Shining, The Bad Seed, The Haunting, Shutter Island, The Exorcist, Repulsion, The Innocents ...)
No spoilers just enjoy the ride ... and all this from first time full feature director and writer, Ari Aster ... watch this space!
Wow. Stupendous.",9,2,4,20 February 2019
Shutter Island," Sublime Scorsese psychological mystery thriller.
","One of the all time greats of its genre .. no spoilers here just enjoy the ride for yourself .. and stay for Dinah Washington's 'This Bitter Earth' closing credit soundtrack to complete the experience.
Wow! This is what movie making is all about.",9,1,2,23 December 2018
The Revenant," I need a Bex and a good lie down....
","I have never waited so long for so little to happen.
You can't just watch this movie - you endure it.
Great cinematography and di Caprio brilliant as always but I was grateful when the closing credits came along.
I have no intention of ever watching this movie again.",5,3,4,6 March 2019
The Godfather," Perfection on film (with Godfather II as it's worthy companion piece ... sadly Godfather III - Godawful.)
","To the (few) giving poor revues ... be very careful. It'll be a late night knock on your door or an invitation for coffee from an old 'friend' or maybe you'll be in a cinema watching Shawshank Redemption, then KAPOW! You'll be nothing more than a red smudge on the wallpaper.
You must never go against the family.
Correct your revue now or it will be you who's 'corrected'.",10,6,7,19 February 2019
