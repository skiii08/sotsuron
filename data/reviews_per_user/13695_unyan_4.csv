Hereditary," Innovative take on old subject matter
","The script and acting in this film are first rate. If you didn't know you were watching a supernatural horror you would only get a clue when the first death occurs some way in. I thought it had a sense of a few older movies from the sixties and seventies about it such as Rosemary's baby and Don't look now. Things only get supernatural towards the end and if you haven't been following the story well enough you may end up confused about how, why and who. If you are a fan of films about the occult then this is one to watch.",8,0,1,16 September 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Try to stay awake
","I can't believe I lost 2 hours 45 minutes of my life sitting through this abysmal drivel. Firstly :THERE IS NO PLOT ! I sat there endlessly wondering when an actual storyline might begin but alas all that's on show here is the usual Tarantino male posturing and espousing over elaborate nonsensical dialogue that the moronic audience lapped up like spoon fed babies.
It culminated in five minutes of ultra violence ( mostly against women) and I was still none the wiser. So Sharon Tate was never actually murdered because Brad and Leo saved the day. That's literally what it's about but you have to fidget for the best part of three hours to find that out. If you've got a brain and a heart go see an Almodovar movie instead.",2,6,8,17 August 2019
1917," Cinema at its very best
",I'm not keen on blockbusters. We always know the heroes will get the job done at the end so we just sit back and enjoy the ride. Nothing is different here aside from the fact that the journey we go on is a total mind blowing visceral experience that will keep you enthralled from start to finish. The sets are so immersive you feel as if you are actually on this journey yourself and the story moves along at just the right pace with a good mix of danger and tenderness woven in. The music is top drawer and the acting too. Rarely will you see a film with five of Britain's top actors in where each of them only gets two minutes screen time. Oscar will love this one.,10,7,10,12 January 2020
Midsommar," Seen it all before
",Like a strange mix of Get Out and the Wicker man. I found myself yawning throughout most of this sadly as it really is around 45 minutes too long. It's a familiar premise which if youve watched any supernatural horror films before won't spring any surprises on you. I was looking forward to it having really enjoyed Heredity which was not formulaic as this one is but as always you shouldn't believe the hype til youve witnessed with your own eyes.,4,21,37,17 July 2019
