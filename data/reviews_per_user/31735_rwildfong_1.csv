Scarface," Nearly a complete waste of time...
","This is clearly a bad film. Terrible acting, bad writing, poorly directed. Pacino is a cartoon character, no depth...all noise and goofy mannerisms. I guess that's what many people like about this film, that it's so goofy it's funny. Sort of a so bad it's good...Ed Wood style. The other major issue is the film is far to long. You could cut this film to an hour and a half and it would be a better film. It still would be difficult to sit through because the performances are so bad (this has to be Pacino's worst ever) but at least it would not waste as much of your time. Most of the players here have done better work. De Palma's best works are Dressed to Kill and Blow Out. If you want to see Pacino in something where he's a gangster or shows off his skill with a weapon I'd say visit The Godfather films or Dog Day Afternoon. Just avoid this ridiculous mess!",1,56,124,18 June 2004
