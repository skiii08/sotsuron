It," Characters that Ring True...
","The strength of most of what Stephen King writes- even when he's 're-imagining' classics like Dracula (SALEM'S LOT) or THE MONKEY'S PAW (PET SEMATARY) or OLD YELLER (CUJO) or the old EC Horror comics, etc.- is his CHARACTERS: they almost always Ring True. IT is no exception, and this latest reincarnation boasts excellent performances all around. (One of the more horrifying aspects of the Pennywise personification- that's only very subtly touched on in the movie- is the influence of Real World killer clown, John Wayne Gacy.) (Here in Crack Town, we had an old man nicknamed 'Snake' and his wife who were both pedophiles. They were caught a number of times, but never went to trial 'to spare the children.' When the couple left the neighborhood, the kids they'd assaulted began to sexually assault even younger kids, culminating in the kidnapping of two five-year-olds by a young teen. Once again, the local 'authorities' refused to prosecute. And you thought 'Derry' was a scary place...) I'm looking forward to the next 'chapter' in the on-going saga of IT, but this one will be hard to beat.",10,8,15,17 September 2017
Erin Brockovich," We do got problems...
","I saw ERIN BROCKOVICH mere days before I saw Erin Brockovich and, while definitely worthwhile, the movie often focuses too much on the woman behind the case and not quite enough on the particulars of the case itself... much like what happened when she arrived here in wilmington, north carolina, to address 300 concerned citizens regarding Dupont's dumping of carcinogenic chemicals into the Cape Fear River (the source of drinking water for 250,000 north carolinians). Alongside a 'water expert' who spouted indecipherable gobbledygook for the better part of an hour and a half, Brockovich said, in essence, that it's all up to US to get things Right (the Mayor of wilmington, who owns a construction company, didn't bother to show up at this Public Meeting- perhaps because he'd gotten wind of something that Brockovich revealed to us that night: that there's a pipeline like the infamous North Dakota Access Pipeline about to begin construction HERE, before long). Like we ain't got enough problems, already... Crack Town- wilmington- has been referred to as 'Ground Zero' for the opioid epidemic in this company (the so-called 'united' $tate$ of ameriKa), with a reported 13% of wilmingtonians hooked on opioids (my guesstimate is much higher- 40-50%-, based on personal interactions I've had with many of the locals over the past two decades). When I arrived here, the then-governor was in the process of accepting a bribe of half a million dollars from the local Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow them to dump Nuclear Waste into the Cape Fear River. (There was no follow-up investigation, as far as I know.) I've personally seen men openly armed with handguns in grocery stores, gyms, pawn shops and shopping mall parking lots hereabouts and the sight never fails to give me pause. The 'housing' DE-Construction going on to accommodate the projected 65,000 newcomers to Crack Town over the next 10-15 years is causing even worse flooding than ever (my own used bookstore was flooded nearly 20 years ago). The bottom line: the denizens of Crack Town are up S--t Creek, without a paddle... News of some small comfort: Brockovich also told us that all of the water fountains in Washington have DON'T DRINK THE WATER! THE WATER IS POISON! signs on them. At least we're not alone...",8,1,1,24 August 2017
The Hateful Eight," Sam gr8ful to get 8...
","The trailer sold me on this one and I went in expecting exactly what I got, so no complaints on that score (which I've scored an 8, ironically). With THE H8FUL EIGHT, the '70s-centric Tarantino penetrates still deeper into the Man on Man Love that characterized both PULP FICTION and DJANGO UNCHAINED- this time around, Sam Jackson getting his dirty dingus 8 on The Down Low (and appearing most gr8ful, too). The similarities to John Carpenter's version of THE THING, from the stringing of a line to the outdoor outhouse to Morricone's reprisal of the theme therefrom itself, are nice touches (Tarantino once cited Carpenter's classic ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 as his favorite film, and it's nice to see he still pays homage to his heroes). Going in, I expected this one to more closely resemble THE BLACK TAVERN (a Martial Arts Masterpiece from The Golden Age of Martial Arts Movies, the 1970s), which tells the tale of a group of cutthroats who gather at a snow-bound tavern to intercept an official said to be lugging around a fortune in bribes only to discover that THEY are the targets of a young woman (the beautiful Shih Szu), who has spread the misinformation to sucker them all to the tavern where she can kill them. (Another thing that prompts this observation: the scene involving 'fresh stew' and the disappearance of a number of bodies... In THE BLACK TAVERN, we actually SEE the cook butchering bodies in a back room while preparing meals...) THE H8FUL EIGHT lags a bit (with a running time of nearly 3 hours, it could've been trimmed by at least 60 minutes with none the wiser), but one can attribute that to the built-in ponderousness of the Indie Movement from which Tarantino and Company sprang (they may not have a LOT to say, but they're going to say it at Great Length, regardless), keeping in mind, too, that Tarantino is a product of '70s cinema-going and seems to delight in remaking at greater VOLUME what has gone before. Best line: 'The Yankees say it's a Free Country.'",8,2,20,4 January 2016
Suicide Squad," Suicide watch...
","There was a time (for me) when a darkened movie house offered Sanctuary from The Real World and all its attendant Horrors; when refuge could be found in Alternate Realities, from the Old West to the depths of Deep Space. Prior to my discovery of alternatives Cinematic, I found escape in the pages of comic books. One eventually gave way to the other, and these days the two are as One. Sorta. For some reason, however, movies these days tend to be far, far LESSER than the comics that inspired them. An odd dichotomy, especially when one takes into account the basic Visual Nature of both. You know the movie's in trouble when a gun-wielding character called 'Deadshot' can't even put a round through one of the eye-holes or even the unprotected lower half of Batman's face-mask. Later, in a totally pointless (not to mention gratuitously extended) scene, we see this 'dead-eye Dick' blasting away with an arsenal of firearms. While I'm sure there were weapons enthusiasts who got off on this scene, for the rest of us, there was nothing much going on (a lot of noise, but little else). There are so many such instances throughout this stinker that it's nigh impossible to list them all (so I'm not even going to try). It IS interesting to note that the money-man behind this one was The Foreclosure King himself (Mnuchin the Money Munchkin), whose greatest claim to fame is that he once foreclosed on a 90-year old woman who failed to pay something like 25 CENTS on her mortgage.",1,2,3,26 April 2017
Southpaw," More schlocky than Rocky...
","Just for the record, Muhammad Ali was not a southpaw- yet, in the movie PHANTOM PUNCH, one of the worst boxing movies ever made, he IS. That's known as not paying attention to detail. In SOUTHPAW, the title character, although a 'southpaw,' boxes from an orthodox stance, not a southpaw stance. Punchy Rocky Balboa was a southpaw who fought from a southpaw stance (far too often, in far too many movies, his head swelling to unbelievable proportions). In both SOUTHPAW and all 57 installments of ROCKY, the lead actors affect 'punchy' attitudes and chew the scenery unmercifully (as bad in that respect as Paul Newman in SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME, yet another woefully miscast boxing movie)- though better the scenery than somebody's ears... As if all this weren't bad enough, we have HBO's 'boxing analysts' babbling on at ringside (making SOUTHPAW the longest HBO advertisement ever made). This mega-melodrama is patently ridiculous and could only have been conceived by someone who doesn't know s--- about boxing (and watching Cinderella MAN doesn't count)- not to mention Dramatic Resolution (Was the murderer ever found out...? Not that I recall.). The reference to 'Night Train,' the music Sonny Liston listened to while training, was, one supposes, some kind of half-a--ed 'in-joke,' though it WAS good to see that Victor Ortiz has found himself another vocation. There are a number of Real Life Fighters who would make interesting subjects for a boxing movie: Jersey Joe Walcott (whose style I emulated more than any other when I fought), Jerry Quarry, Do Ku Kim, Alexis Arguello, Hector Camacho, Billy Collins, Ron Lyle, etc., but there's probably nobody who would even know where to begin with ANY of them. A boxing movie should focus as much on BOXING, its perfection and tactics, etc., as Martial Arts movies focus on the mastering of Martial Arts. (Which may be why we'll never see such a movie: What filmmaker has a legitimate GRASP of Boxing? NONE that I know of. The closest approximation would be Bruce Lee, who understood more about both hand to hand combat AND filmmaking than anyone before or since. Or perhaps EVER. It would've been interesting, indeed, to see what HE could've done with a boxing movie...) I've seen more in gyms than can be IMAGINED by most 'boxing writers.' I've seen amateurs fighting so fiercely that they knocked each other's headgear off (no easy task); I've seen guys get punched through the ropes to land on their head on hardwood floors; I've seen more teeth get knocked out than a dentist on his busiest day. From MY VIEW FROM THE CORNER by Angelo Dundee: 'He's on his own, out there in the loneliest spot in the world, the center of the ring, just him, the other guy, and the ref. And that other guy is there to hurt him and the ref can't help him...' SOUTHPAW is just another (bad) example of somebody who doesn't really have a grasp of boxing cranking out crap that should never have seen the light of day. As a trainer once told me: 'Nobody goes fifteen rounds with the heavy bag and wins.' In boxing, there are no excuses, only results.",1,3,5,28 January 2016
Ant-Man," The Marvel Militainment Machine marches on...
","A simple(-minded) concept transfigured to better fit the Militainment Mold of Modern Marvel, ANT-MAN ain't, man. What it is, is this: 'America's politics would now be also America's favorite movie,' to quote the late Norman Mailer (see THE PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS). From STAR WARS to ANT-MAN and beyond, the studios are milking the Mindless Masses for all they're worth; doing their part, as it were, to further the Military Entertainment Complex. Americans, as Mailer points out in CANNIBALS AND CHRISTIANS, are 'eager to slay.' What better way to slay than to play- to live vicariously through soul-deadening video games and, now, movies that offer little more than more of the same? 'Patriotism,' Mailer pointed out, 'was a football game.' And: 'Wars shift from carnage and patriotism to carnage and surrealism...' The worst offense of all: ANT-MAN trots out the likes of 'Michael Douglas,' as if in so doing it'll add something to the movie. It doesn't.",2,7,17,28 December 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Past near Perfect...
","The tendency of today's filmmakers to rely on state-of-the-art technology presents its own paradox: the more the alleged 'filmmaker' relies on cgi, the less convincing the film s/he produces. X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, like the first two films in the franchise, boasts an interesting enough premise- and the opening sequence is certainly shocking to fans of the serial-, but the rapidity of the action almost manages to undercut its shock value: as with Chapter Two of THE AVENGERS (and I can't help but think of most of today's movies as serials; because they ARE), the cgi hits the fan so fast and furiously that many of the more Dramatic Moments get lost in the backwash. It's only when the movie finally slows down enough to catch its breath that X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTUTRE PAST becomes an absorbing piece of Entertainment, as beautifully realized as Chapters One and Two (Three wasn't bad, but it wasn't as well crafted as this one). Filmmakers would do well to remember that it's the CHARACTERS that make these movies worth seeing for some of us.",9,0,0,3 December 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Jack Kirby's Black Panther arrives- in style...
","CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR starts out as a gabfest but mercifully degenerates into a cgi slugfest before all is said and done. While it's not exactly sophisticated in its overall concept ('divide and conquer'), it's better than most of the comic book-based fare to which we've been subjected these past several years. The only reason I was interested in seeing this one was because it promised to finally introduce one of Jack Kirby's greatest creations- The Black Panther- to the Big Screen. His origin story is told (however briefly) and we get to see him in costume (in the comics, his one-piece all black costume is almost identical to the DC Golden Age character Wildcat's costume) and in action (outrunning speeding police vehicles in questionable cgi sequences, but otherwise stealing most of the scenes he's in simply by virtue of being there). There are more superheroes per square foot in this one than in both AVENGERS movies combined. Comics fans can't ask for more (the screen couldn't hold 'em).",8,4,8,20 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More is even less...
","It boggles the mind to think that today's Military Entertainment Complex has but ONE approach- the militarization of movies, with cheesy cgi thrown in for 'good measure.' Today's movies have come to resemble little more than the video games that preceded them; that movies like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON are based on COMIC BOOKS boggles the mind: with characters long established and story lines quite literally laid out in easy-to-follow 'storyboards,' the apparent inability of Hollywood's 'brightest' to cobble together anything of movie-going value is puzzling, indeed. What more do they need...? (A lifelong love of Storytelling wouldn't hurt, nor would an affinity for the Comics upon which these Big Budget Bombs are based, but the Hollywood 'elite' seem uninterested in what has come before and clichés are heaped on clichés with all the finesse and depth of a television commercial...) A big budget doesn't necessarily denote quality.",3,4,11,17 November 2015
The Witch," Scapegoat...
","It's never really clear why the Outcasts were cast out, nor why they insist on blaming all their woes on their goat. How this group manages to build (let alone maintain) a farm is beyond me: these folks lack Common Sense in great abundance. The script (for lack of a better word) is rivaled only by the direction in terms of amateurishness. (The single scene worthy of note: a long shot of a robed figure moving through the forest cradling a newborn baby.) Perhaps it's the lack of Perspective that hurts THE WITCH: it's never really clear if the filmmaker is wagging a finger at the gullible who persist to this day in believing in Gods or Goddesses or if he's just a Fright Film fan taking his turn at bat(...), and it's this unevenness that make THE WITCH just another dreary bit of business.",2,1,4,22 June 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The Golden Age of Mental Health Care in the U.$....
","Here in 'No Care' North Carolina, what we find in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST seems almost quaint. Let's say you were feeling a tad suicidal after a serious operation about ten years ago. What would happen is this: you'd find yourself shackled to a chair in a 'mental health facility.' The following day, you'd be driven to another city, where you'd find yourself in a run-down building in the worst part of town. In the bathroom, you'd find the floor and walls literally covered with blood. Some of your fellow inmates would be controlled via 'chemical restraints.' They'd walk around like something out of a George A. Romero movie, drooling and staring sightlessly at you. If you could get to sleep at night (because of all the snoring), you might find yourself awakened by an old man standing over you, cursing you for no reason at the top of his lungs (which he would do once too often and end up being beaten so badly by the brutal, hulking staff members that he literally wouldn't be able to sit in a chair); or find yourself flat on your back, the stitches from your heart surgery just a few days old, lifting your feet to try to fend off a pair of combatants coming your way (they would stop just short of where you lay, but would tower over you until they resolved their 'issue'); or find yourself mere moments from defending- very possibly to the death- a nurse attempting to give out the daily 'meds' to a psychotic patient actually seven feet tall... In the end, they would give the patient a bus ticket and put them on a bus to any other city in the country they wanted to go to. That facility, I've been told, has been closed for the better part of a decade. Nowadays, if you're extremely lucky, you can talk to a therapist in another city on a television screen once every two to six months for thirty minutes. The solution to the problem of mental health care in this state has been to outsource everything to the Prison Industrial Complex. And Electroshock Therapy IS still used these days. At least HERE, in 'No Care' North Carolina.",9,1,2,11 January 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Another recruitment video...
","Yet again a Giant Monster has been used as a recruitment tool for the Military Industrial Complex. The entire first thirty minutes of KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a love letter to the ameriKan war in Vietnam, with tired old Sam Jackson trying his limited best to sell this stinker. (Glaring at a giant gorilla while standing rooted to the spot amidst the destruction of a fleet of helicopters- with tons of shrapnel whizzing through the air all around him- seems to be Jackson's idea of proving himself 'a tough motherf--ker.' He's wrong: he simply looks like a f--king FOOL.) The computer-generated Kong is cool, but, like the cg GODZILLA of just a few years ago, he has too little to do; this is (AGAIN) a puff piece for the armed forces of the Military Industrial Complex.",2,0,1,28 July 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Comicdumb at its worst...
","Curt Swan's SUPERMAN was an inspiration to the young Poe426; as was the BATMAN of the same period. To see how the Mighty have fallen is akin to attending the Final Moments of a Loved One (which I've done). Superman suffers not one but TWO brutal cgi beatdowns in BATMAN VS SUPERMAN, and he suffers them back to back; no wonder 'The Man Of Steel' succumbs. Historically (or hysterically), both beatings were the kind of lamebrained gimmicks comic book publishers/editors come up with to try to breathe life into what they believe are foundering titles (like 'variant' covers or tin foil covers, etc.), and now they've transposed same to The Big Screen. It is what it is, and the movie speaks (ever so poorly) for itself.",2,3,6,7 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The power of the Farce...
","'A flurry! A superficial but lively work-in-progress is proceeding.' So wrote Norman Mailer in THE SPOOKY ART, his book on writing. STAR WARS was, arguably, the first 'first-person shooter video game-' before the vg as we know it was even invented (Pac-Man doesn't really count, as the graphics were of the Caveman-wall-painting variety); and STAR WARS: THE FARCE (RE-)AWAKENS is about as close as I'LL ever get to watching a full-blown vg on the Big Screen. Like Mailer, 'I can sit with an empty mind.' But movies are a VISUAL medium and, when the Visuals are un-engaging, all the Moviegoer is left with is the story- which, in this case, is mostly refried beans. Beat for beat, we've seen almost everything here BEFORE. With R2-D2 and C3PO waiting patiently in the wings, why re-create the former in the form of ButterBallBot- just another toy to market; another in an endless line of 'actionless figures' to send the foolhardy scrambling to the nearest toy store...? If the movie has a single saving grace, it's the Stormtrooper who has had 'a bellyful of killing,' a disillusioned Hatriot who has tired of the sight (and smell) of Blood. (Of greater interest than his 'sudden conversion' would've been a sequence- or two- showing him GRADUALLY becoming more and more averse to his occupation as he slaughters innocent after innocent, face to face as they beg for their lives. Or something to that effect. 'I saw The Light' just don't cut it.) In the final analysis, THE FORCE AWAKENS lacks the Magic of ORIGINALITY (which could be ventured of the entire series but for the first two installments to hit the screen); it's the NEXT installment that will truly tell the tale. (Perhaps my biggest problem with this one was its running time: after 30 minutes of television commercials, the 3 hour running time had me literally draped over my seat in exhaustion.)",7,3,27,21 January 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," ...stays in the shadows...
","Like Onur Tukel's SUMMER OF BLOOD, WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS caught me totally by surprise. I'd heard absolutely nothing about it and was as pleasantly surprised as I'd been by the former. Too bad so-called 'serious' vampire movies aren't half as good as the comedies these days... Petyr, the Max Shreck look-alike, almost managed to steal the show simply by LOOKING like an '8,000-year-old vampire;' the makeup's THAT impressive (as is his costume); but my favorite has to be Viago, the 'dandy.' His 'happily-ever-after' moment at film's end was very sweet. I also liked the closing spell: 'You will forget everything you have just seen...' Recommended.",8,3,6,21 July 2016
Deadpool," Med school dead fool...
","Although it peters out about three-quarters of the way through, the first three quarters of DEADPOOL are definitely worth sitting through: the movie's funny and cynical, with a definite 'who gives a f---' attitude toward comic book super heroes. (By their own admissions, a number of the writers of comics from the early to the mid-1970s wrote said comics while indulging in a variety of mind-altering drugs. While this didn't make for BETTER comics, it certainly made for DIFFERENT ones. DEADPOOL fits right in with them.) It's interesting that not a lot of people seem to have gotten wind of the fact that DEADPOOL is really a flipping of the bird to comic book superheroes and their now quaint codes of conduct. The character himself might just as easily have been a Villain as a Hero, although his past as a corporate assassin pretty much settles that issue (at least, for ME it does). Written with an eye toward its target audience (young teens), DEADPOOL often straddles the fence between Adult and Adolescent entertainment. If one can hark back to one's misspent youth, one CAN enjoy DEADPOOL, despite its blatant catering to the under-twenty mentality. (It's the seemingly endless cgi finale that brings the movie to a screeching halt, the way cgi finales almost ALWAYS bring movies to a screeching halt; some of these animated sequences drag out so long that one finds oneself drifting off into daydreams of other things.) Better than average, but a far cry from Great.",8,1,5,5 January 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Maxed out and running on fumes...
","THE ROAD WARRIOR is easily the finest of the quartet; MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the worst. The reason: THE ROAD WARRIOR delved- however briefly- into the CHARACTER of Max the Mad; FURY ROAD deals more with high-octane, pedal-to-the-metal fx. Max himself is literally little more than a hood ornament for the first part of the film. (Is this supposed to be the same character from the first three films...?) His derring-do is undercut by the very CGI that saves him- at least THE ROAD WARRIOR (like, say, George Romero's KNIGHTRIDERS) featured some truly stunning stuntwork; in FURY ROAD there's never any doubt that he'll pull through (as long as programmers at computer terminals have got his back, anyway). When the action abruptly stops, the movie comes to a screeching halt. There simply isn't anything in the way of STORY to keep it interesting. For hardcore video gamers only.",4,9,17,7 October 2015
