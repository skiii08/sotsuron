The New World," Sublime to boring
","The first half of this movie seemed like a sublime dream - with beautifully intimate scenes and wonderous landscapes. Unfortunately the director couldn't keep up the bar he had set for himself and the film slipped into a boring hour of self-indulgence with the most abysmal performance (yet impressive accent) from Christian bale. Its difficult to think what the director thought would impress us during this hour? The predictable conclusion? The simple lack of plot and blatant mid-film re-use of the previous love stories scenes and emotions? Its like hes made two movies and the second one isn't very good and starts at about 90 minutes into the movie (when you'd expect to leave). Really disappointing, maybe wait for the DVD when you can push stop.",5,1,6,11 February 2006
50 First Dates," Romantic Gem (*Introductory Spoiler*)
","For me - rob schneider is the icing on this cake for the movie. His character lives his sex life through Adam Sandler as he has a wife and kids. Adam is good as Henry - his lovably calm attitude adds to any hilarity created and he has an impressively portrayed charm. I was a bit anti-drew before this movie, now I'm won over a bit by her portrayal of the sorrow in lucy. Its a bitter sweet comedy with an ending to melt the heart. Emotionally - its a rollercoaster ride you take with sandler as he realises a few things you only roughly know from the trailer :P Great for lostening up as the comedy is top notch and quite independant of slap stick which creates the highs of the rollercoaster.",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
The English Patient," The best film of all time.
","Now let me start by balancing my review :P This film isn't perfect, the story is pretty slow in parts, not so much the first time you watch it but after that there's bits that take a long time to add little value to the film. Also let me say I'm not some art student, fan of art-house films or anything other than a normal movie goer so I don't really understand people using big words to review a film.However I am happy to say that this is the best film of all time. I've watched a lot of films to the point where I've almost run out, I've worked my way through other peoples lists of 'best films of all time ever' and gave them a fair chance. But this film is fantastic! The reason why I like it is very soft I'm afraid, it's such a raw depiction of how real relationships happen. You become completely immersed in the unspoken desires of the core characters, you *will* the relationship to unfold and if something goes wrong you're screaming 'NNNNOAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH'. You can imagine times that the same thing has happened to you but your life did/did not pan out like that.Ralph Feinnes does what he does best, plays a reserved Englishman masking incredibly intense emotions as best he can. In other films it's not appropriate and you can see that his range is quite narrow but here he slots in perfectly. Kristin Scott Thomas does exactly the same with flair. Everything else about the film is technically perfect. If you haven't seen this film then you're missing something special.",8,4,6,27 August 2011
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Shockingly Bad
","This is the worse movie I've seen in a while. I was hyped up to see it and really looking forward to it but it was just so bad i had to walk out and this is the first movie I've ever walked out on. Things that were wrong with this movie :- *Shockingly bad child actors that are precocious beyond humour *Ridiculous over-emphasis on the boring elements of the plot - everyone knows that they walk through a wardrobe, why did it take 60 minutes for them to do so? *Completely transparent special effects - you can quite blatantly see that the first horse-man was just a man with brown trousers on. *Enormous portions of the movie where there was no music and the kids were just talking crap.Where's Peter Jackson when you need him? :( I cant put into words how bad this movie is compared to what it could have been.Hats off to Tilda Swinton (White Witch) - she was up to scratch and had a go at saving this farce but it just wasn't enough. Unfortunately Liam Neeson (Aslam) just sounded like a wise nanny.Expect to be bored stiff & expect young children to cry with boredom.",1,6,17,15 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Independence Day Part II (*Vague spoilers*)
","So - we saved the world from aliens only to wreck it ourselves (joke). My Independence day reference is actually about the sub-plot architecture, the main plot is basic and would be boring if not for the sub plots involving a central family - exactly what Emmerich did with will smith. Graphics are hard and fast with impressive 'world' graphics like glaciers & an oil tanker in Manhattan. Some CGI lacks - it seems to be a current Hollywood ploy to draw 4 legged animals badly and then zoom in on them. The central and some of the outer characters have a depth and clear change that gives emotion to the film and absorbs the viewer as the plot absorbs its characters. The casting is quite similar to Independence day too - Donny Darko star Jake Gyllenhaal co-starring when he still feels un-proven as an actor to me (like elijah wood in deep impact (pre lotr) & will smith in ID4 - first serious acting role since prince of bellair) and a nice cameo from Bilbo Baggins. Its incredibly interesting how emmerich portrays the characters obvious perception of the situation but lack of discussion - like talking about it will take away a surrealism.",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
American Beauty," Absolutely Eccentric
","Im relatively young and this film is the first that made me emote. Its the ultimate pick me up, a subtly humorous view of depression and one mans obscure recovery. Arguably, This is a black comedy mixed with a plot rivalling 'The English Patient' in complexity. This film tackles all issues in its own way allowing everyone to relate to it. An unforgettable performance by Kevin Spacey and a film that launched Chris Coopers career. I dont wanna blabble on - Watch it!!!",Null,0,0,20 April 2003
The Machinist," Falls a bit short of the mark
","** SPOILER HINTS AT PLOT PATTERN ** With films like fight club setting the bar for this type of plot twist thriller, I don't think this film reached it. I'm an enormous Bale fan and a major fan of this sort of film, that shows feasible paths for normal people to become the most unrecognisable shadow of themselves. Throughout the movie, there is an obvious and pending plot twist as you watch reznik rip himself apart but the director made us wait too long. The plot twist is powerful but not worth the preceeding period of boredom, since its quite obvious what is and is not real, watching the scenes that reznik completely imagines becomes tedious. It's definitely worth a watch for fans of Bale and the genre. The plot twist is enlightening and agreeable but its the sort of movie you'll want to take a break in the middle of.",7,1,1,6 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not a bad offering
","This latest book conversion in the series lives up to expectations. While the other characters retain a sense of whit and live up to what you would expect, harry reveals more to both sides of himself - his flaws as a child and depth as a growing person. That aside, this movie works quite well independantly - I saw it with 2 people who had no interest in seeing the previous movies and they admired the films other good points: Nice special effects & constant plot twists. A lot of plot detail exists here to attempt to make us think but for me, this is where the movie flounders as an offering for adults as the more intelligent and critical of us will predict crutial plot points quite easily and lead to self awareness, Saying that - the plot points retain their emotion and fight off boredom. Child Acting, Plot (too fast to retain depth, restrained to one location), One very lord of the rings comparable creature & obvious CGI in moments sum up my gripes. The score is top notch and the OST worth an independant listen (- John Williams usual amazing standard).",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Oh my - A film thats as good as its trailer!
","Maybe it was listening to 'Staind - Outside'? I loved the trailer to bits. It looked exciting, fast paced and the movie lived up to the set standard! The major factor that clinched it for me was the acting or John Amedori (Evan:13) - he looks just like ashton kutcher as a kid and acts out the vital scenes with skill. The film is a blend of introducing evans childhood and then explaining segments that you are not shown and that evan hasn't seen either as he blacked out! Its a great tale of self discovery that we all would be so fortunate to follow in this way. The plot is basic but not predictable and the sub plot architecture sucks you in, letting you go to return to the main plot for very short periods of time while you catch your breath. For me, its a more contemporary Shawshank Redemption - but i don't wanna start a rukuss with Shawshank fans :)",Null,0,1,3 June 2004
I Am Legend," Severely lacking
","This movie appears to be a mish mash of several other movies, introducing nothing new at all. The plot is your bog standard 28 days / resident evil zombie plot with just enough changed to avoid litigation. The angle of the plot is completely on will smiths character with everyone and thing else just being an add on. Its clearly packaged as a surreal action film but is screenplayed as the emotional journey of the protagonist. After 30 minutes you clock that you've been conned, but the first 30 minutes are quite good. The middle 30 minutes are completely spoilt as you've been hyped for action that plays as sloppy emotion and the ending is pure emotion. Your left with nothing to do but critique the CGI and try to explain the enormous continuation and plot holes.If you just want to scare the crap out of yourself for 90 minutes - go for it but you'll end up unsatisfied no matter what you're looking for from this film.",5,1,1,5 January 2008
Paranormal Activity," Truly terrifying
","-- Quick introduction about my review --I found this film to be truly terrifying. I'm a male in his mid- twenties, quite into horror films and have watched them frequently recently. There are a lot of reviews slamming this film by people angry that there was hype surrounding it. It's just a film. I don't watch a lot of TV, I'd seen the trailer maybe 3 times in the cinema and had not discussed this film with anyone other than the person I went to see it with. If the viewing experience of this film depends on your cynicism, the amount of hype you're exposed to and the atmosphere around you then my angle is: - I'm a very cynical person, I complain constantly and expect masterpieces when I go to the cinema. - I was exposed to limited hype but understood this to be a popular film that looked promising. I understood nothing more than the trailer and queue sizes of the cinema before viewing this film. - I was nearly late to the performance and was in a packed cinema full of people chatting until the film started. The crowd were very animated, constantly gasping, screaming and commenting loudly during the film.-- My Review --My experience of this film is one that I'll never forget. The actors gave a truly spine chilling performance that gives me goosebumps when I recall any scene from the film. The plot is really well managed, it's an uphill roller-coaster that constantly plays with the audience but never letting them loose. The effects leave nothing to be desired, they were perfect for the film and you would never guess that this was a low budget film, in fact you end up thinking 'They did all that with how much?'. The low actor count creates an appropriate feeling of isolation that complements the film. The film contains no music but it has a lot of sound effects and ambient sounds. I think music would have ruined the atmosphere they worked so hard to create. The main actress gives a really mind blowing performance, there is no point that you doubt her performance in a truly challenging role. The film is truly compelling to the point where I had to keep reminding myself, 'its not real' and make a conscious effort to distance myself. The film deals really well with your own scepticisms about the paranormal and the characters take up opposing views on the argument to leave you to make up your own mind.-- A Warning --Personally I think it's really undersold that this film is terrifying. I really would warn people to understand this before seeing it. You may find that you are one of those people that feel bored during this film but if it stimulates you in the correct way ... well my heart was pumping so hard I started to get worried.",10,0,3,26 November 2009
The Departed," Be warned - this is a scorsese movie
","Given the sheer mass of acting talent in this movie I think Scorsese has completely out done himself to create something thats for the most part boring. Yet again the sheer scale and charisma of the actors have carried his bad directing and shocking dialogue. I cannot emphasise enough how patchy this movie is - any scene thats enjoyable is followed by some amateurish gibberish that just makes you want to run up to Scorsese and hit him with a bread stick. Given my rant, the plot is OK for the most part and makes me really want to read the book. The actors cant really be blamed for the bad dialogue, aside from matt damon who just drains your energy with his shocking facial expressions and poor performance. If you *must* see this movie make sure you're not the one paying for the DVD caus you're guaranteed to feel like you wont get that money back.",4,2,7,1 July 2007
The Reader," A wonderful surprise!
","Who knew that a film called 'The Reader' would be a controversial film about paedophilia in post Nazi Germany. I suppose its like being surprised that 'The English Patient' isn't completely shot in a hospital. I'm a big fan of Ralph Feinnes, I may never have watched this film if he wasn't in it. I mean seriously it's called 'The Reader' - reading is not the most stimulating of activities when you're doing it so why make a blockbuster about someone else doing it!? But wrong I was, this is the most gut wrenching, thought provoking roller-coaster I have watched this year. It tackles two of the most sensitive topics imaginable with a completely unbiased brush only bent on telling a compelling and emotional story. If you like that sort of cold-but-true Ralph Feinnes film where nobody really conveys emotion but the emotions that are implied rip you out of your seat then you will love this film. Not much here for people that don't like romantic dramas but so much for people that do! The TV guide listed this as 'the performance of winslets career' and that is completely correct, immediately you're not looking at the lady that was in Titanic any more, she blows you out of the water. No bad acting all round really but everyone else has a pretty easy ride compared to winslets character.",10,0,0,18 November 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The weaker of the three films
","I haven't read the books but I was definitely disappointed with how little happens in this film. I saw all 3 films in a day and the first 2 were fairly fast paced and entertaining but for a film that sells itself as a romance novel *nothing* happens in it. There are some action scenes and some fairly impressive CGI werewolves but they still cut away a lot of the time when a vampire does something that would involve CGI which makes you wonder what they spent their $65M budget on. I was also pretty fraustrated with the constant swaying of the plot, its obvious whats going to happen at the end of the film but it goes backward and forward treating the viewer like a bit of an idiot. Honestly you could skip this film, knowing that theirs a fourth coming out next year I'd just wait for that.",6,1,5,11 December 2010
Click," Less agenda, more comedy.
","This isn't a bad film, especially by todays standards, but its not a comedy - as long as you accept this fact then the movie begins to hold its own. Jokes come thick and fast at the start but die down for about half the movie whilst the writer pushes his agenda which isn't a bad one - if you fast forward life you wont enjoy the moment etc etc but its a com-e-d-y. The other people writing reviews are saying they cried which is fair enough but only proves the point, if you go in wanting to laugh don't expect to leave laughing. On the other side of the coin this is a very poinoiant movie which will no doubt affect everyone that watches it in a positive way.",7,0,1,1 October 2006
Sin City," A Bad Film
","This film is really depressing - How can you take so many good actors and so much time spent editing to such a unique style yet generate something that is boring. I'm going to write off the apparently bad acting as an attempt at being consistent with the style of the novels. This film consists of a series of short stories that vaguely interlink, some better than others. The story featuring bruce willis is unfortunately boring and really slams him as an actor. The story to follow that is quite exciting and the next one isn't too bad although i zoned out during the middle. Then it returns to the willis boredom-fest - at this point i walked out on the movie (and I usually really feel a need to finish a movie i go to see). This sort of anime-style cartoony film noir stuff is tough going and the movie is pretty gory, which is a good thing and saves the movie for short periods, an obvious influence of Tarantino. The style is an obvious copy of shindlers list and an attempt to put the batman & general marvel style comics to the screen. Overall - an incredibly over-rated movie thats worth a watch if you're doing so for free but the film wont be remembered in a years time.",6,0,2,30 August 2005
