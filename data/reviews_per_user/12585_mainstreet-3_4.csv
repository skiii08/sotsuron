50 First Dates," Good film
","I loved the Asian characters (Amy Hill, etc) in this film. Finally a film that does justice to Hawaii. Unlike other films that constantly disparage and stereotype people of other colors, this film actually embraced the culture of Hawaii.The characters are well-developed and aren't simply the clique caricatures we usually have to suffer through. Like Drew isn't just a flaky girl sidekick. There's some emotional depth to that character when she reveals how much she internalizes her feelings because that what a good friend does. Sure they are exaggerated at times, that's expected since it's a movie, but somehow George Wing the writer keeps it realistic where I could see this sort of thing happen in high school. And the clich√©s usually seen in teen movies like when the house party goes horribly wrong, gets trashed and the protagonist gets in major trouble are thankfully bypassed. The love story is also believable as Adam Sandleer deals with it as a normal guy might; it's not completely awkward. When Drew and her have misunderstandings, they are plausible and the reactions are real enough to believe.",6,0,0,15 March 2007
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Good humanity on display!!
","Pongo and Hattie, the pups' parents could be Lady and the Tramp a bit further down the road while Cruella De Ville follows the models of preceding Disney female baddies, only with even more flounce and extravagance. Apart from the 'Cruella De Ville' song, there's a distinct lack of musical interludes, which serves the purposes of the one-long-chase plot-line reasonably well. There's gentle humour as you'd expect and a tolerable running gag with the little pup that's forever hungry. I thought the best sequence though was right at the start when Pongo persuaded his owner to cosy up to Mattie's in the park, but the narrative manages to engage all the way through with the 'human' characters also achieving sufficient degrees of personality to embellish the tale before the obligatory happy ending. You'd have to be pretty hard-hearted not to enjoy this delightful animation which I took pleasure in doing today for the very first time.",8,1,1,7 December 2019
Silence," 10 all the way!
","Having seen this movie, I decided to wait for a few hours to digest it and see if my opinion changed. After that time, I am more convinced it is a movie is flawless in its single-mindedness, its technical craft, and in its acting, but there are a couple of problems with the film.Its violence is realistic and gut-wrenching, as many have said before. For a time this shock works towards its purpose, and you flinch at every blow. As the movie wears on, however, its relentlessness begins to de-humanize the sacrifice of its main character.As I'm writing this review, I find myself trying to do so without any sort of revelation of my own personal beliefs, and it is difficult. If this were any other character besides Jesus, I'd be simply complaining that I didn't identify or feel any sympathy with the main character, and, consequentially, the suffering and the sacrifice's impact are lessened, and the movie suffers for it.But this is about JAPANESE CHRISTIANS who endured horrific persecution because of their beliefs. Not unlike Christians today who endure persecution from the secular crowd who will one day be ushered into eternal darkness forever. Sobering.I speculate that Scoreses was not interested in humanizing the Japanese, though. The film does not sermonize its message, but simply documents it. If this is what Scoreses intended to do, then he succeded with aplomb.And though this review seems negative, I dont' intend it to be. I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars, and stick by it. It is beautiful, though painful, to watch. It is moving and, in its purpose, it succeeds. I walked into the movie expecting to be blown away, and wasn't, but I was still intrigued, and its made me talk to others and think about my own faith. Perhaps that was the intention all along.",10,2,3,7 December 2019
Aladdin," Great film!
","Quick......what was Aladdin's true name? Answer: Either 'Genie or Genie does,' depending on where he was.Most of you probably know that but I didn't, probably because I hadn't watched this movie since it came out in 1992 with Robin Williams! I was a little kid, and never did see this again on TV or VHS. I only saw it again because several high-definition DVD websites said this looked spectacular on Blu-Ray.Aladdin is the perfect film with Robin Williams as the Genie! How right they were; this looks incredible! I cannot believe how fantastic the artwork is, and sharp the picture comes through on this restored high-def disc. The colors and the amount of details in all the art are astounding. Many of the scenes had my jaw dropping in admiration. The story, frankly, is not anything that great for a man my age but the visuals are so fantastic that I enjoyed the experience.I also appreciated the 2.55:1 widescreen picture. If you've only seen this on formatted-to-TV 4:3, and love the movie, you owe it to yourself to see this version. You won't believe how good this 1992 film looks.",9,1,1,19 October 2011
