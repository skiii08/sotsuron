Source Code," A Great Si-Fi Thriller. (contains 1 spoiler)
","Source Code is definitely up there with Inception, District 9, Pandorum, Moon and Tron Legacy with the best Sci-fi films over the past 10 years. There is somewhat of an original idea here and also slightly confusing which may put off some viewers. I wont give many spoilers away but this is basically the plot of what the film is about.American Army helicopter pilot named Colter Stevens whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train. But he discovers he has assumed the identity of another man. 8 minutes later the train explodes and Stevens finds himself in some kind of pod. After going back and forth in someone else's body, he later discovers that he is in a science project known as Source Code. which can put someone in another person's consciousness during the last 8 minutes of their life. The whole point of this is because of an American Extremist(A Bomber) who has threatened to commit other attacks hence why Colter Stevens goes 'back in time' to find who the Bomber is and prevent further attacks. SPOILER: Source Code is a science project that consists of quantum mechanics which somehow connects to a parallel universe (I THINK) ...oh and there's Memory wipe :P sounds like a mouth-full for a just an hour and half film. The Director has done a very well done job at keeping this movie suspenseful and entertaining with the very thoughtful intelligent plot. A Bloody Good Film Indeed :)",7,0,1,29 April 2011
