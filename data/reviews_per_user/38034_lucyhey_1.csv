Hereditary," Best horror movie I have seen
","The trailer to this movie does not do it justice. Brilliant movie through out, it had so many shocking moments scary and non scary. I feel like the ending with brilliant and the whole movie very smart. The cinematography and acting (particularly Alex Wolff) is brilliant. Although I don't think the title (Hereditary) does the film any justice as it makes you go into the theatre thinking the film is one thing when it is another.",10,2,4,10 July 2018
