The Blair Witch Project," This is the movie by which all bad movies need to be judged
",This is the worst movie of all time.  I can't believe I'll never get that time back that i spent sitting in the theater waiting for something interesting to happen.  This movie is just proof of what you can do with an advertising budget 20 times bigger than what it cost to actually film the movie.  Give me a camcorder and I'll turn out something at least half-way interesting to watch.  When the credits started rolling all I could do was look at my date who looked back at me with the same look....'Did we really just sit through the entire movie...surely there's about to be some more frames pop-up...or maybe it's intermission.....this can't be what I paid my hard earned money to see....I'm gonna kill my friend who recommended this.',1,14,26,29 March 2002
