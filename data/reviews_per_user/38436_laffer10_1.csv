Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's just a movie....2 hours and 10 minutes of great entertainment!
","Let me preface this by saying I'm 34 years old and a SW fan...etc...etc...I was there as a 12 year-old in the lineup for the original SW and of course was absolutely amazed by the film, and the following two 'sequels'. Now it is 22 years later and with children of my own, who have seen the original trilogy on video, I get to take them to see TPM.  This is a true treat! Let me say this, Mr. Lucas, you have done a wonderful job with your vision. Do not let these naysayers cast any doubt on your abilities or vision, you've done a splendid job.  You and Mr. Spielberg have the innate ability to touch upon what movies are supposed to be about, pure entertainment, plain and simple.  A movie is supposed to just let you get away and enjoy yourself and not dissect and critisize every little nuance of story, character and effects.  If you want to do that, go see documentaries.  You have created a wondrous fantasy that we can all just sit back and enjoy.  Kudos to you!  As far as 'what's in it for adults'?, I say to them, stop trying to see it through the eyes of an adult, it's not for you anyway, this film is for the inner child in us that most people seem to have lost.  People get a grip!  Sit back and enjoy the experience!  It's just a great way to while away a couple of hours.  The expectations of an adult are way too high!  We could tear apart every movie ever made and this one is just not appropriate to do that.  I look forward to the next episode with the same enthusiasm as TPM",9,0,0,24 June 1999
