Blade Runner 2049," Justice done to a Sci-Fi classic
","This movie might have a very slow pacing to it, but more often than not, that just serves as a way of making the important scenes even more stunning and atmospheric. This film ignores the predictable formula of modern blockbusters, and follows more in the footsteps of the original to develop a sequel and a believable follow up to a film which was nearly 40 years before it (not to mention also set in the future, or pretty much the present day based on the original timeline!)On the acting - Gosling delivers an understated performance as a conflicted replicant. De Armas is captivating as the holographic love interest. Leto plays the psychopathic corporate boss and fits the bill pretty well. Ford resurrects Deckard with his older/wiser outlook and I thought Carla Juri was also superb in spite of her relatively short time on camera.Is there anything much to criticise? I wasn't sure about the K/Deckard fight sequence with the Elvis songs. I guess some humour was needed somewhere(!) but this didn't quite work for me. It didn't spoil the film though, because 99% of it is a spectacle.The story follows the replicant K most of the way through. The puzzle develops and teases us as to whether or not he is important, or whether he is just a pawn caught up in a web of corporate greed and rebellion in the blade runner universe. We're led to different locations of the blade runner universe as he endeavours on his search for the truth. The audio flashbacks to what other characters have said earlier in the film is an effective way of creating the feeling of confusion and disillusion e.g 'but you've never seen a miracle'I've absolutely no issue with the soundtrack unlike a lot of other fans. I actually thought this was delivered perfectly on some key scenes in the film, including the bizarre but absolutely amazing love scene involving K, Joi and Mariette. The sea fight towards the end was also superbly orchestrated. In fact, those are probably my two favourite scenes of the film.Villeneuve is welcome to direct more visually stunning sci-fi on this scale. I hope to see more films of this calibre in the near future.....A rare case of a great sequel.",9,2,9,2 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the terrible movie the fandom would have you believe, but it's not great either.
","Last night I revisited this film for the first time in years with a slightly fresh take on it. I have to admit, I felt very let down when I first saw the film (as like so many others, I think it's almost universally acknowledged that this was some way off any of the originals). The truth is - this is a very mixed bag of a film. It's full of goofy and ironically, animated Disney-like moments (strangely now feels like an omen) but there are some great sequences amongst the awkwardness of it all. The Neeson/ Qui Gon scenes seem to stand out as the best - I liked how he connected with Shmi, his interesting relationship with the Jedi Council,. his closeness to Obi Wan/Qui etc etc. This was all characterised extremely well. The lightsaber duels at the end were also excellent, with some great Darth Maul moments, and a cleverly concocted suspense with those red forcefield doors creating delays before each part of the fight. And on the bad CGI imagined characters, Watto the Toydarian was the better of the animated characters for me.As for the negatives, Natalie Portman did not look at all comfortable throughout the film. Nute Gunray seemed like a pretty turgid and weak villain and the whole political story in the film felt more like a sideshow than a driving force. Darth Maul was underused. And whilst I don't understand the hate leveled towards him, Jake Lloyd as kid Anakin felt like a poor casting choice. He wasn't that bad to be fair - the script he had was hardly inspiring!All in all a 6.5 out of ten for me - Neeson kind of saves this film from being a complete disappointment, and having something that feels worth a watch (if only for the one time)",6,0,0,18 January 2020
500 Days of Summer," A cautionary tale about love
","Before I watched this movie I just was expecting a romcom - a standard slushy movie where boy meets girl over a summer period. I had no expectations of the film and sometimes that's always for the best. I was obviously very pleasantly surprised and then some.It's made fairly clear from the outset that the two characters Tom Hansen and Summer Finn are destined to have their lives collide in some way. We see it built up through a selection of scenes that build up our sense of the apparent romance going on, but the crucial scene where Zooey Deschanel's character just wants friendship is the film's central and binding core. As an audience member, you want the couple to become just that. The chemistry seems real, the scenes depicting it fool us into thinking perhaps it may still go somewhere (the IKEA scene with the two pretending that they have already settled down is an example). I related to his naivety in this hope that she will be won over sometime in the course of the casual dating. Gordon Levitt's performance is excellent - you can see in his eyes alone a desperation and desire that doesn't leave him throughout the film, but also a denial that he doesn't want to face the facts. I empathised and sympathised - not least because if someone like Summer Finn was dating you you would probably become exactly the fool he portrays. Her smile and mannerisms are hypnotic, and Zooey's acting seems natural, not forced, to back this up. A number of actresses could have easily overplayed the role, but she is subtle in the way she bounces off Gordon Levitt's moves and charms.The countdown-of-the-days sequences and whistle-like cue weave perfectly into the story to lure us in to his naive obsession of his date and tempt us into believing the romance of the pair. My favourite part of the movie is probably when they reunite on the train, and during the sunset you don't hear the talking of the characters you just see their facial expressions, but critically you sense this meeting is setting up the finale of their dating, for better or worse. The Temper Trap song beginning to the visual of the last moments on the train is enchanting to the point where you want to be stuck in the moment and not leave it, in spite of all the warning of the story in the scenes before.The romance lovers in the audience will have at this point been praying for Summer to decide she likes Tom enough to make it a long term relationship. The realists will realise the tragedy of this reunion and that the character who will suffer most is Tom.When we're shown the reality and expectation split screen, most of us are watching the reality part, but really want to see the expectation happening. At the point of the ring reveal you can feel the heart being torn out of Tom's chest.....and if you've ever been a fool for love, this was a real heartbreaker of a moment that you would be able to relate to. This was actually the one part of the film where I think Zooey's character was a bit cruel. If you are casually dating someone for a long period at least, to not say anything about another involvement I think is harsh.....particularly by way of showing an engagement ring. Or at least I think so.Anyway, back to the review - which is that this film achieves its purpose with the flying colours of a summer festival - to tell a cautionary tale of a one way love obsession, and not to forget the signs that it is, just that.",8,0,0,6 April 2015
A Quiet Place," Felt familiar often, but with a clever and delicate execution
","I definitely enjoyed 'A Quiet Place' but in spite of the nicely set up 'hush concept' there were many moments of the film that felt overly reminiscent of other films and franchises. I'm not sure it's a great sign when a scene makes you recount lots of other scenes from films. That can become a bit distracting, and I have to admit there were a number of moments in the film I felt this. I might just have seen too many films of course, but one minute I thought 'Signs', then the next 'Jurassic Park' (particularly with the noise the monster was making which reminded me of the velociraptors) and there were hints of Predator and Alien in here too. Tropes like self-sacrifice, finding the monster's weakness, and 'must save the kids' were all in abundance. Throw in some 'Stranger Things' vibes as well. With the appearance of the monster, I couldn't help but think of the Demogorgon.Lots of positives to draw from this suspenseful horror flick though. Brilliant acting from the whole cast including all the child actors (and the baby!) The monster was concealed well until the late major scenes, which is always preferred to revealing too much early on in this type of movie. The sounds used outside of the silences were cleverly placed and executed. Emotion was used really well, the characters were strong enough to have you caring about them - how many horrors kill off characters without even introducing them properly?So in summary - the strive for originality in this one was evident, but at times the influences of the film were too obvious. Decent and delicate film overall.",7,1,1,28 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Impressive as a whole- even if (like the dark side) a little unnatural at times
","I definitely enjoyed this film, as I came out satisfied and contented that I'd been very much entertained on a number of levels.Lets start commenting with the good points- special effects were impressive (even if a little overused, especially in previous films) and the transcending final scenes with real sets and intriguing props were a great linkage to 'A New Hope'. I was also impressed by some great action scenes and fights in some of the earlier parts of the film. The fights as a whole were certainly better looking than the sloppy ones in 'A Phantom Menace'. I was particularly impressed with the fight between Dooku, Kenobi and Anakin and the start of the film, for me this was a top point of the film, and I think I actually preferred it to the final fight. I felt far more emotionally involved in this scene and felt Anakin's guilty confusion over killing Dooku. For me, if this fight scene had been made a bit longer, it would have been perfect. I also give credit to the scene where Palpatine makes his transformation to the emperor we know so well from the classic trilogy- this is effectively fear invoking, and the setup for Windu's fate is simply spectacular. Where I was less satisfied- Anakin had previously felt guilt for the death of Windu and Dooku- but suddenly goes on to kill a load of 'younglings' and feel no guilt whatsoever! This was a bit hard to believe, and I would have liked to have seen more scenes that bridge this sudden transformation of his personality from good into completely evil. Furthermore, the film did not make us feel much sympathy for any of the deaths Anakin had caused in his destructive path; thereby making us become an unsympathetic audience. I criticise the fact that we knew none of the youngling characters, so it was hard to empathise with them when they were killed. Sure, we're upset about it, but 'Empire Strikes Back' is far more successful in making us sad about 'scoundrel' Hans Solo getting frozen- than 'Revenge of the Sith' is in making us sad about the death of younglings or any of the jedi for that matter. The film for me also fails in some of the final scenes- particularly the laughable outcry of 'noooo' from Darth Vader. This could have been made so much better-perhaps a cruel displacement of his anger and distress on a nearby Officer would have been a better way of ending his complete transformation to the darkside rather than a silly 'noooo'. The crucial fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan was reasonable, but I think it would have been better on a more realistic set- such as the ones in the classic trilogy.To conclude, the film is thoroughly entertaining, but some points which seemed 'minor' originally have affected my outlook on the film as a whole. 70% successful in my mind.",7,0,0,10 June 2005
Cube," An enthralling experience
","I had only read a hint of what 'Cube' was about when it appeared on the TV schedule, and as I thought it sounded intriguing, I recorded it. The following day, from the moment I began to watch it, I was hooked.Being a sci fan and a student of psychology this film was indeed perfect for me. There were more twists and turns in some of the personalities than the cube itself. This is what gave the film its psychological and thought provoking value.The character that really shocked me was Quentin. Appearing as a headstrong do-gooder cop at the beginning to later become a psychotic killer was for me, unexpected. I was comfortable with Quentin the way he was to start with, before this alter-ego stepped in. Another interesting character change was concerning Worth. His stance to begin with was very negative (being a part of a team involved with the Cube's design), but as Quentin turned for the worse, Worth turned for the better. Nicky Guadagni's performance definitely deserves a mention, she portrayed her character Holloway with every ounce of believability.The concept of this film was brilliant, and showed that you do not need astounding computer graphics to create something special. The claustrophobic atmosphere was captured well by the screenplay and the design of the green, red and blue rooms, each one holding a new surprise for each individual.One of the other great things about the film, was the difficulty in predicting who would survive, and who would die. Many films and sequels make the mistake of making a hero obvious, thus making him or her immune to being killed off. In this film, however, the heroes became known only toward the end of the film, and thus you fear for each individual in the cube, not just one.Finally, this is a must see for those looking for intrigue and originality.",8,4,7,21 January 2006
Annihilation," Forward thinking sci fi with lots of ideas
","I'm always a bit perturbed when a film which is clearly more courageous and visionary than a lot of others in both scope and vision is bashed by critics who would rather see one with just some good acting and a very predictable, cliched storyline. Enter Annihilation, a classic example. In fact, the acting in this film is pretty good, the story is reasonable but above all, the vision, concept and style of the film is where this pushes it well above your average sci fi horror flick.The scary/action sequences were almost certainly the points of the film that were the highlights. From that hefty croc beast to the awesome lighthouse sequences towards the end of the film. Not forgetting the scene where they're tied to chairs by Anya, before the entrance of that mutant bear; this is one of the more intense scenes you'll come across in recent film releases. My absolute favourite part is probably when Dr Ventress explodes - just spectacular; and this whole sequence was quite clearly nailed by the production team.The soundtrack was suitably dystopian, oddly beautiful and weird.On the concept - I liked how we learnt more about the shimmer as the film
went on. Teased at each significant event with something else the shimmer does - both to humans or whatever resides within it.So if you want some weird sci fi delivered in a fantastic visionary style, look no further than Annihilation.",8,1,4,4 April 2020
