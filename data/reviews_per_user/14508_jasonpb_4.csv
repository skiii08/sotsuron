Black Swan," A Beautiful Nightmare
","One would not put the phrases 'psychological thriller' and 'professional ballet' in the same sentence, but Darren Aronofsky's newest film, Black Swan, allows us to do just that, and a lot more.Aronofsky, director of Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and The Wrestler, once again creates an experience in Black Swan that is visceral, emotional, and captivating from beginning to end. The plot follows a young ballerina, Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) in her quest to win the role of the Swan Queen in director Thomas Leroy's (Vincent Cassel) production of Tchaikovsky's famous 'Swan Lake.' Leroy has no doubt that Sayers can play the white swan, who is nubile and innocent, but doubts her ability to play the black swan, who is darker, more sexually charged, and less refined. When Sayers wins the role, she feels pressure from her overbearing mother and the demanding director Leroy to enact the 'perfect' performance. Added to that pressure is Sayers' suspicion that her alternate, Lily (played by the lovely Mila Kunis of That 70's Show fame) is plotting to take her place and is in fact preferred by the director.Black Swan takes the viewer inside the often depressing world of professional ballet dancers, where the pressure not only to perform 'perfectly' but also to look 'perfect' seem to reach incomprehensible levels. Sayers, who is bulimic, another underlying problem in the world of professional ballet, is played wonderfully by the beautiful and ever-maturing Natalie Portman. It should also be noted that Cassel (whose appearance in mainstream cinema is long overdue) and Kunis (who deserves and will likely get more prominent roles in the future) are both perfectly suited for their roles as well. Aronofsky's use of light to depict good and evil is both obvious (at its most basic, contrasting the white and black swans) and subtle (lighting of various scenes, use of mirrors, clothing, etc.) and most importantly serves to clarify Nina's psychological turmoil.While Portman and Aronofsky serve up a thrilling and troubling final act, the most disturbing character in the film is Nina Sayers' mother, played by Barbara Hershey. The bright, happy, mother-daughter relationship depicted in the first act of the film are nothing more than a guise for what lies just under the surface between these two characters. Hershey plays the role of the over-protective mother to perfection, but her character indeed goes beyond that. By the second act, the viewer has the sense that the mother has also established firm psychological control over Nina, and is living her own (short-lived) ballet career vicariously through her daughter, placing additional pressure on the already deeply troubled Nina.Despite the outstanding performances by Hershey, Cassel, and Kunis, and perhaps the year's best directing by Aronofsky, the film, and particularly its final act, belong to Natalie Portman. Portman's real talent here is her ability to portray an incredibly wide range of human emotions in a relatively short period of time. The viewer not only sees but even feels her obsession, her pain, her loneliness, her sexual repression, and ultimately her pursuit of unattainable perfection. The viewer can see the pressure on young Nina building from all sides, but one clearly senses that the greatest pressure is that which the ballerina places upon herself. Her descent is thus rooted in this internal struggle rather than on the external pressures, making the final thirty minutes all the more terrifying.Overall, Aronofsky has succeeded once again at using his medium to create a visceral experience that allows the viewer to see and feel a wide variety of human emotions. His use of light and symbolism are without compare, at least among this year's crop of films. Aronofsky allows a glimpse into the human psyche that probably follows more closely along the lines of Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain, rather than The Wrestler, but may be a better overall film than all of the above.",9,3,7,28 December 2010
American History X," Neo-Nazi Changes Life While Imprisoned
","American History X is a great movie which discusses the very real impact of racial hate in the United States.  The story is centered around Derek Vineyard, and his experiences in prison, which ultimately change his life 180 degrees. After he is released from prison, he finds out that his brother, Danny Vineyard, is going down his same path.  Derek realizes that if wants to be at peace with himself, he must stop his brother from going down the road he went down.  The beauty of the film is captured in the last scene, when Danny shows that he has finally figured out what is important in life.  I can't find any reason as to why Edward Norton did not win Best Actor for this magnificent performance.  I give this a solid 9/10.",9,0,0,25 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," One of the best films of this decade so far
","David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is undoubtedly one of the best films of this decade. The film takes the viewer down an ever-more disturbing path, one that will evoke every feeling in the book before it reaches its raw, nerve-shattering conclusion. As one reviewer put it, 'Mulholland Dr. gets in your head and stays there.' This statement could not be more true. No film is harder to decipher than Mulholland Dr., but from David Lynch, we would expect nothing less. The non-Lynchian crowd will be frustrated to the point of fury, while those who respect Lynch's work will be drawn to this film's complexity and dark symbolism. It takes a special person to enjoy a movie with more metaphors than actual plot, and more symbolism than hard fact. Those who dwell on what is real and what is not will not be able to fully absorb the sheer brilliance this picture. In fact, I recommend that a first-time viewer simply ignore Lynch's cryptic '10 clues to solving the thriller,' and just enjoy the film for what it is: a masterpiece of modern film-making which does not rely on big-budget action or cheesy romance, but rather on a consistent and intriguing script and an absorbing, real-life quality that many films lack. Lynch's camera may resemble that of a horror film to many, and indeed at least one scene pushes the gates of the horror genre nearly wide open. The throbbing, often hostile soundtrack will only add to the feeling of fear incurred by this picture. Overall, I found Lynch's newest film to be a piece of cinematic brilliance with few flaws and much to offer for the philosophic, or simply just observant, viewer. Any film that has the ability to lead to hours of pointed discussion between recent viewers (as Mulholland Dr. has a reputation for doing) has done well for itself. Indeed, Mulholland Dr. is a love-it-or-hate-it film, with little or no grey area. Those who love it will watch it countless times, and develop and redevelop long-winded theories and themes that they believe Lynch has hidden in the film. Those who hate it will denounce Lynch has an arrogant surrealist who believes that the more complicated something is, the better it is. For my part, I loved every minute of this film, and each time I watch it, I discover something new. I was speechless after watching this film, with thoughts racing through my head so fast I thought it might explode. Films rarely have that effect on me. For those who are tired of the Hollywood big-budget summer blockbusters full of testosterone-filled men slaughtering each other with machine guns and beautiful women in bikinis disarming nuclear weapons, try something new this summer. Try David Lynch's Mulholland Dr.",10,8,15,18 August 2005
The Happening," Shyamalan's Worst to Date
","The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable. Signs. Writer/Director/Producer M. Night Shyamalan has created some remarkable, original, and enjoyable films. Then there are the more recent ones. The Village. Lady in the Water. And worst of all, The Happening.I will first admit that I was quite looking forward to this film, I thought from the previews that it could be Shyamalan's return to originality, quality screen writing, and inherent understanding that a shocking conclusion does not necessarily make a film great. The Happening, however, is far and away his worst effort, and easily the worst film I've seen in the last five years (although admittedly I do try to avoid those that have no chance of being good). The film actually gets off to a decent start, when people in Central Park begin to die mysteriously. The intrigue created by the first scenes lasts only momentarily, however.I would typically begin a review with a few positive words about a film before ranting about its negative elements. This film, however, lacks any redeeming qualities. The dialogue is as bad as it could possibly be. Cheesy lines, unrealistic arguments, and pointless conversations quickly erode any interest in the larger plot. The dialogue gets worse, not better, as the movie progresses. One particular scene, involving an argument between the two main characters, is particularly painful to watch. One doesn't know whether to laugh, cry, or get up and leave the theater at such moments. The director never comes close to achieving his desired emotional reactions from viewers. A general moaning and groaning could be distinctly heard at such moments from the crowd at our local theater. Never mind the plot, which is far-fetched, under-explained, and generally nonsensical. The dialogue and acting alone kills this movie quicker than you can say 'Marky Mark, what were you thinking?' A writer/director must implore the reader to CARE about at least some of the characters in a film, allowing the viewing audience to relate to them in some sense, otherwise, the entire plot appears nothing more than a joke.While on the topic of jokes, my colleague and I assume that this entire film IS in fact a joke, a setup by Shyamalan to see how much money he can make writing, directing, and producing a worthless film with no redeeming value. My advice? Do not contribute to his funds. I feel as though someone ripped my wallet from my hand, extracted $7.50, and threw it back in my face, only this process somehow took an hour and a half to complete. Talented directors like Shyamalan should be forced to produce something of value once in awhile. For this director, it has been years. And the trend, unfortunately, is headed in the wrong direction.",1,5,12,14 June 2008
