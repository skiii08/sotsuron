The Lobster," The Lobster
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story is set in a somewhat dystopian future were everyone is expected to get married. Trivial things become the corner stone of relationships like nose bleeds and limps. The story takes the ideas of love, relationships, and societies view of love and turns it into a terrifying world. The story is at time funny and horrifying. The ending is very ambiguous and leaves you feeling stunned. Yorgos Lanthimos directed Dogtooth which is also a black comedy with some very interesting social questions that is much like The Lobster.The acting is very good. Colin Farrell performs the best as an average Joe with nothing special about him at all. Rachel Weisz also performs well as she narrates the story and plays a pivotal part in Colin Farrell's characters story. John C. Reily, Ben Whishaw, Angeliki Papoulia, and Lea Seydoux all perform well.The pacing is very bland and slow. It is done on purpose though. The film wants us to turn into Colin Farrell's character and see his meaningless existence. The music is also a little repetitive and the runtime is overlong. Pros: Interesting, funny, and dark story, great performance by Colin Farrell, good overall acting, a good ending, and slow pacing that was meant on purposeCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and repetitive use of musicOverall Rating: 8.2",8,2,4,4 March 2018
Hereditary," Hereditary
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerIt should be noted that this film is incredibly disturbing. I am not a person that is easily scared and I am usually not impressed with horror films. This film thoroughly impressed me with the amount of quality scared and the eerie atmosphere.The story starts off very fast and builds the tense very well. All the characters are believable and relatable in a way. The story creates a very mysterious tone but keeps a very scary feeling throughout. The plot gets extremely disturbing very quickly and keeps the disturbing imagery flowing smoothly and gracefully. The use of silence makes your stomach turn as you anticipate a scare, sometimes the scare come but other times it leaves you waiting. The acting is extraordinary. Toni Collette delivers a stunning and frightening performance. She is truly an amazing actress. Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro also give amazing performances. Gabriel Byrne performs very well and is my favorite character in this film.The pacing is perfect. The first half hour of the film was scare free but the remaining runtime left me tense and scared.This is one of the most effective horror films to date. The ending left he disturbed and I had chills running down my spine as the credits rolled. I left the theatre frightened and had that feeling of maybe I shouldn't have watched that. Spoiler BelowI thought the father's death was a little weak and that the plot twist that Joan was friends with the grandmother was telegraphed. Either way, the film stilled held onto its power of disturbing the mind.Spoiler OverPros: Disturbing and dark story, great use of silence, music, and the building of tension, perfect pacing, very disturbing imagery, amazing acting, Toni Collette's stunning performance, and an ending that will leave you scared and hopelessCons: Read the Spoiler section if you want to know the consOverall Rating: 9.1P.S. This is one of the best films of 2018. I would not recommend this film to people who are easily scared. This film only had about two jump scares but this film will leave your disturbed and wishing you hadn't watched it. If you want a less scary witch's tale, I would recommend The Witch: A New England Folk Tale",9,19,38,16 June 2018

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story does have some funny parts, like all the destruction, but it is mostly a romance than a comedy. The story is a little slow and most of jokes didn't make me laugh.The acting is good. Robert De Niro, Owen Wilson, Teri Polo, Nicole DeHuff, and Blythe Danner all perform well. Ben Stiller is the same character he plays in all of his other movies. He, in my eyes, doesn't perform well.The pacing is slow and the runtime is overlong.All in all, this film is a romance first and a comedy second.Pros: Some funny jokes, the disaster scenes, some good acting, and a good romance storyCons: Ben Stiller's performance, slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some unfunny jokes, and this film is a romance not a comedyOverall Rating: 5.0",5,2,4,17 February 2018

Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both do a great job. Bruce Willis is the highlight in this film.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is a little overlong.The plot twist is okay.

David Fincher has created a well-crafted film that ends with a shocking scene. The film explores what would happen in political chaos.The acting is great. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both perform perfectly. They both play characters that are night and day, total opposites.The pacing is very good but the runtime is overlong.I would not consider this film a masterpiece but it is a very good film.Pros: Smart and fun story, an amazing ending, great acting, very good characters, and good pacingCons: The runtime is overly longOverall Rating: 8.9",9,1,2,20 May 2018
Darkest Hour," Darkest Hour
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerDarkest Hour tells the story of Winston Churchill during the time of World War II. One of the films best aspects are the great speeches. They are all chill inducing and uplifting. The story loses some steam towards the end but it is a good film nonetheless. It was great to see the other side of Dunkirk. After watching Dunkirk, I watched this film and it added so much more.The acting is very good. Gary Oldman totally deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. He truly became Churchill. His mannerisms are exactly like Churchill and his speech patterns are flawless. The prosthetics and art department did a great job transforming Oldman. 
The pacing is very flow and the runtime is overlong.Pros: Great speeches, interesting story, great use of prosthetics and makeup, and amazing acting by Gary OldmanCons: Very slow pacing, the film losses steam towards the end, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 7.1",7,1,4,23 April 2018
Monster," Monster
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger Glamour girl Charlize Theron's breathtaking, heartbreaking transformation into the completely opposite image of Wuornos makes this film an astonishing achievement. The movie does not explain or dive into the mind of Wuornos which is a missed opportunity. The story also focuses to much on the lesbian love story side than on the killings.What makes the movie a little bit better is Theron's performance, open, vulnerable, tragic, moving, and most of all, honest. Aileen's behavior is contradictory, volatile, and disturbed. She loses control and lashes out irrationally. Theron's portrait of Aileen is sympathetic without pretending that she is more of a victim than the men she killed. The pacing is very slow and the runtime is overlong.SPOILER ON NEXT LINEI really wished we could have heard the testimonial given by Selby. Also I wish we could have seen the execution and Wuornos' last words.SPOILER OVERPro: Interesting story, Theron's performance, and some good killingsCons: Missed opportunities when it comes to the story (see spoiler line), slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and not enough depth into the mind of WuornosOverall Rating: 6.2",6,1,2,19 February 2018

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger12 Angry Men tells the story of one jury man who goes against the majority in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The story might seem rather boring and mundane, but it is quite the opposite. The story is told in real time and the debate between the characters is amazing. The dialogue is fluid and characters are complex yet simple. The ending is very good.The acting is great. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber all perform very well. Henry Fonda delivers a stunning performance as a man reluctant to persecute under substantial evidence.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is short.The film is very old and this can sway some people from watching it.Pros: Great story, good characters, fluid dialogue, great ending, good acting, amazing performance by Henry Fonda, perfect pacing, and a short runtimeCons: The film is very old and some part don't hold upOverall Rating: 8.9",9,2,3,16 May 2018
About Time," About Time
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the only romance films I have ever truly like were the Before Series films. This film is a touching and very original story. The dealing with time travel is never explained which kind of a downer is, but the romance story is moving and powerful. The film elegantly introduces us to the characters and lets us connect with them. We see their personalities and their love of family. The ending is touching and really hit home.The acting is very good. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry and both perform very well. Bill Nighy delivers a very sobering performance as a loving father about to lose his son. Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, Tom Hollander, Margot Robbie, Will Merrick, and Vanessa Kirby all are great side characters that add so much to the story.The pacing of the film is slow but it introduces us to the time travel aspect very early. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Touching, powerful, and original plot, great ending, Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams and their great chemistry, good side characters, and Bill Nighy and his story is very touchingCons: The ability to time travel are never explained, slow pacing, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 8.2",8,3,4,7 March 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter the massive success of Deadpool, we were bound to have a sequel. The sequel is just as good if not better than the first. Deadpool two has a more original and less cliched story. It also introduces some amazing new characters. As always, the humor is spot on and the violence is over the top. The acting is very good. Josh Brolin plays Cable magnificently. I was skeptical going into the film but he blew me away. He is tough and totally awesome. Ryan Reynolds once again is a perfect Deadpool. Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, Karan Soni, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapicic all perform very well. Zazie Beetz was cast as Domino and at first, I was not happy. But she performed very well as Domino. All the X-Force members perform very well and are hilarious. I did not like Julian Dennison's character and he is a bad actor. He has a weird voice and his body is shaped like a pear. He looks like a Teletubby.The pacing is fast and the runtime is good.The CGI for Juggernaut looked quite bad compared to Colossus Pros: Original and hilarious story, great jokes and gags, amazing characters, great new characters, Josh Brolin as an amazing Cable, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, good acting, fast pacing, and a good runtimeCons: Julian Dennison looks weird, he is not a good actor, and the CGI for Juggernaut looked cheapOverall Rating: 8.8",9,6,13,27 May 2018

The story is interesting and very entertaining. The story does lose some steam in the middle but towards the end it picks back up. I wish they had gone into her sex tape controversy because it would have added to her story.The acting is very good. Margot Robbie performs very well as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser (who is hilarious), and Bojana Novakovic (who is such a sweet lady) all perform very well. Allison Janney delivers the best performance throughout the entire film. Her brutality towards Tonya is so real its scary.

Jennifer Aniston's character is probably the best only because Jennifer is so freaking hot. The story is fast paced and is very funny with well timed jokes and some over the top humor.

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerLife of Pi is a visually stunning film that has some touching and powerful moments. The story is told in a flashback and has some very original content. 
Most of the visuals are very good but there are some that blatantly look like CGI. All in all, I found the ending to be very powerful and that made the film very good.The acting is good. There are only two notable actors throughout the film and that is Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan. They both do a great job. I do not intend to sound racist, but the accents used throughout the film get horribly annoying after the first half hour.The pacing is very slow. The film drags one in the first act but picks up towards the conclusion. The runtime is also very overlong.Pros: Good story, powerful ending.

Interstellar," Interstellar
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerI recently watched this movie on TV for the third time and just had to write a review for it. So here it is.First off, Christopher and Jonathon Nolan has created a complex and inspired story with some very powerful and emotional moments. The story is told slowing but in a way that makes us connect with the genuine and well made characters. The scientific side of the story can be hard to understand but after a second or third viewing everything becomes clear. The amount of foreshadowing and the plot twist are what make the film great. The story is powerful and is Nolan's 3rd best film (The Dark Knight is #1 and Memento is #2).The acting is amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his greatest performances ever. He bring such emotion and raw power to the screen. Jessica Chastain, David Gyasi, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all perform well. Anne Hathaway performs the worst. She is very bland and I have never been a fan of hers anyway.The pacing can seem slow to some, but the story takes its time to tell the story and introduce us to the science and the characters. The runtime is very long at a staggering 2 hours and 49 minutes long. But like I said, the story takes its time to develop ands keeps you involved.The CGI in the film is amazing. Space looks beautiful yet daunting. It looks peaceful yet terrifying.Pros: Inspired story, great use of foreshadowing and a great plot twist, emotional moments, complex science, amazing acting by Matthew McConaughey, good overall acting, good CGI, slow pacing in order to let the story develop, and a slightly unresolved endingCons: Anne Hathaway's dry performance, the pacing can be seen as slow and the runtime is very longOverall Rating: 9.2P.S. Much like Blade Runner 2049, the film takes its time to introduce the world and characters in a deep and complex way. Both films expect the audience to want to be involved in the process of telling the story.",9,2,3,4 March 2018

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power.The acting is very good.

Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes. The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect.There are a couple of things I didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two.Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire filmCons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringyOverall Rating: 9.5P.S.

I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two.Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire filmCons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringyOverall Rating: 9.0",9,1,4,20 May 2018
2012," 2012
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAt best, it's a nearly three-hour film packed with several tons of clichés whose best features are explosions and general destruction. At worst, it's a gruesome, depressing subject as viewed from the seat of a passing roller coaster.Disaster movies are usually very popular and have long managed to thrill plenty of people with their huge scale and awesome special effects. Since 2012 (which is tied to a much-debated Mayan prophecy that supposedly names that year as the one in which the world will end) is one of the biggest and most spectacular to date, it will no doubt follow suit -- and, in terms of visual effects and clear, exciting filmmaking, it is well done. And the impressive, appealing cast does its level best to read through the third-rate dialogue without too much eye-rolling. But anyone looking for character depth, powerful emotional content, intelligence, poetic images, or personal expression of any kind is advised to look elsewhere.Overall Rating: 1.3",1,3,7,9 March 2018

Ralph Fiennes also performs extremely well as a despicable and detestable Nazi commander. All of the supporting actors and actresses perform very well.The pacing is slow and the runtime is overlong but Spielberg directs the film with great respect for the victims of this horrible tragedy.Pros: Saddening, disturbing, and painful story, very deep characters, sublime acting, amazing performance by Liam Leeson and Ralph Fiennes, and great directing by SpielbergCons: Some slow pacing and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 9.0",9,1,7,19 May 2018
I Am Legend," I Am Legend
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerDirector Francis Lawrence has a way with suspense; jumping out of your seat is almost a requirement here. Onscreen, Manhattan transforms into a true island, isolated, removed, and falling apart. Weeds grow on the streets, Times Square is deserted, the Flatiron Building sits neglected, and an eerie hush has fallen. Bravo to the special effects crew, who have created a New York never seen before (except, perhaps, in Escape to New York). The results are nothing short of amazing.But the story ultimately disappoints. It starts out strong, hooking viewers in, but it sputters in the end. It's as if the screenwriters (or director, or producer) ran out of ways to wrap it up. Or perhaps the film simply doesn't have the same nuances as the Richard Matheson book on which it's based. Still, you can't fault I Am Legend for trying to be different from the typical action thriller. Taking on such themes as mankind's need for companionship, the fight for survival, and the existence of God, it at least succeeds in making us think.Overall Rating: 6.0",6,2,2,10 March 2018

The story is full of dark and memorable moments that stay with you long after the film is over. The dialogue is fluid and the action is intense. The opening sequence is one of the best opening scenes ever. The ending shows us how evil can win in the end.The acting is amazing. Heath Ledger delivers his best performance ever.

Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, this is my second Woody Allen film, the first being Midnight in Paris which was very good. After watching this film, I hate Woody Allen. His character is narcissistic and rude. He always thinks about himself and his voice made me want to kill myself. The story is slow and boring. The characters constantly talk about sex and there is no way Woody Allen would ever get that much puss. He sleeps with at least five women throughout the film. That in and of itself is impossible. He is a short, ugly, and annoying man. The film is so shapeless and it repeats itself so many times, it is an utter chore to watch.The acting is bad. Woody Allen casted himself in a film he directed (He has an ego problem). He is really bad also. Diane Keaton is quite good though. She plays a quirky yet cute woman.The pacing is horrible. The film is slow and the runtime feels so long.All in all, Woody Allen sucks.Pros: Diane Keaton performs wellCons: Woody Allen plays a narcissistic and annoying man who thinks that he knows everything, Woody Allen would never get that much puss, the story is boring, the characters suck, bad acting, slow pacing, and a long runtime.Overall Rating: 3.0",3,4,9,21 May 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the film is a story of humanities evolution and is a philosophical work. Stanley Kubrick was reticent about offering up a definitive explanation for the movie and encouraged audiences to interpret it for themselves. I would highly recommend watching an explanation video after finishing the film. I found one on YouTube by LondonCityGirl - Knowledge. She really helped me understand all of the symbolism and helped me fully understand the very complex story.With all that said, I found the film very confusing. After the film ended, I was left perplexed at what I had just witnessed. The story is very complex and has many symbols. Symmetry, shapes, alignment, and time all play an important and sometimes subtle role in telling the story. I found the plot extremely interesting and the eeriness and surreal-ness of the film was great. The music choice is stunning. The music that plays when we see the monolith/sentential is creepy and eerie. The acting is very good. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester all perform very well. Douglas Rain, who voices HAL 9000, performs the best in my eyes. His performance as HAL left chills running down my spine and he brought an almost humanlike aspect to HAL.The pacing is very slow. There are a number of long scenes that are merely a black screen or a docking sequence. These can be tiresome. The runtime is also overlong. There is a lack of dialogue but the symbolism behind the heavy breathing and moments of pure silence are there for a reason. The CGI is okay. I know this is an old film but it doesn't hold up to the standard that Star Wars created.All in all, this film is a great work of fiction and is a defining movie when it comes to cinema.Pros: Complex story, great use of symbolism, eerie music, good acting, Douglas Rain's performance as HAL 9000, and great directing by Stanley KubrickCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, okay CGI, the story is extremely complex because of the use of symbols, and the ending is very confusingOverall Rating: 8.3P.S. This film reminded me of Interstellar, they both have a similar ending. Interstellar is much easier to understand but I would still highly recommend this film to Sci-Fi fans",9,3,6,19 March 2018

After watching amazing horror films like The Babadook, The Conjuring 1 and 2, and The Descent, I went into this film with low expectations and was thoroughly entertained. The story is dark, disturbing, and gruesome. The imagery used throughout the film is very scary and the tapes add to the horror. The plot twist was very good and the ending was frightening.The acting is mostly good. Ethan Hawke always performs well in every o=movie I have seen him in. Hawke is accompanied by Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Michael Hall D'Addario, and Clare Foley who all perform well. James Ransone performs the worst because his character is dry and he can't act very well.The pacing is slow in some parts but it is mostly consistent.

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story is extremely yet elegantly complex and thoughtful. There are numerous scenes that are symbolic and a handful of metaphors throughout the film. The story is deep and deals with the human condition as it relates infidelity. The ending in my eyes did seem a little weak.The acting is very good. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman both do a great job at portraying their respective characters. Tom Cruise plays a vulnerable man who is torn between revenge and doing what is right. The only downside of the acting is that Tom Cruise doesn't play the doctor role very well. He just doesn't look like a doctor.The music is the part of the film. The music perfectly blends with the film giving it a sense of wonder and mystery.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong. The tone is mysterious, dark, and unsettling.There is an abundant amount of nudity throughout the film. The nudity is there as a symbol. It symbolizes the temptation of infidelity.Pros: Elegant and complex story, well crafted symbols and metaphors, good acting, stunning use of music, storing yet varying tone, and a great use of nudity as a symbol of infidelityCons: Overlong runtime, Tom Cruise as a doctor, some slow pacing, and a weak endingOverall Rating: 8.2",8,2,4,3 February 2018

The story is funny, brutal, disturbing, and memorable. The story is told in a nonlinear fashion and requires the audience to pay attention. Tarantino has created some of the most complex characters in cinema. They all have personality and are relatable in various ways. The dialogue between the characters is amazing. The ending is stunning.The acting is very good. Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Amanda Plummer, and Ving Rhames all perform extremely well. They all give their characters a certain flair and keep the story going with their individuality.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is justified because Tarantino builds his story and characters slowly.The amount of cursing in this film is, in my opinion, unneeded. I found the extent of the swearing excessive. The use of violence is perfect though.Pros: Elegantly told story full of memorable moments, a lot of funny moments, amazing characters, great dialogue, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good use of violenceCons: Excessive cursing and the runtime can be long for someOverall Rating: 9.1P.S.

The Shape of Water," The Shape of Water
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe Shape of Water tells a tale of two unlikely lovers. The story is interesting and engaging. Guillermo del Toro is a masterful storyteller. I just feel that the critical acclaim for this film set the bar way to high. I did not see it as a masterpiece, nor should it have won the Oscar for Best Picture. It is a good film with great visuals. The social message shown throughout the film is a little cliché (Love can be between anyone). But I did enjoy the ending.The acting is very good. Michael Shannon performs the best in my eyes as a man who never fails. Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Doug Jones all perform very well also. Sally Hawkins does a very good job portraying her characters. She is also shown completely nude in this film which is great (Her breasts and pubic hair can be seen).The pacing starts off fast but it slows down in the middle. The runtime is also overlong.The music used throughout the film is great and the set pieces and props make it feel like the 1960s.Pros: Original and interesting story, good storytelling, great visuals, very good acting by Michael Shannon, good overall acting, seeing Sally Hawkins completely nude, and a great use of music and propsCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, a cliché social message, and the movie was not as spectacular as the critics made it out to beOverall Rating: 7.2P.S.

War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerGangbusters effects and terrific camerawork propel Steven Spielberg's film well into its last act, when it runs out of energy and ideas. This collapse is especially disappointing because War of the Worlds begins as a provocative look at how terror affects family and community, that is, something more complicated than an explosion movie. If the first part of the film offers an absorbingly detailed look at the family's dysfunction, the ride in the minivan tightens the focus, as they struggle to make sense of the disaster unfolding around them. 'Is it terrorists?' asks Rob. No, says Dad, this 'came from someplace else.' Rob tries again: 'What do you mean, like Europe?' This brief comedy only sharpens the scares that follow, not all caused by aliens. Indeed, two of the most awful scenes involve people fighting each other.This and other particulars -- a monstrous surveillance eye on a sinuous, seemingly endless arm invades Harlan's basement; clothes from disintegrated victims float through tree branches; a peanut butter sandwich Ray has thrown at the kitchen window slides almost imperceptibly down the glass as he wonders what to do next; Ray asks a man who appears to have survived a plane crash, 'Are you a passenger?' -- create a potent mix of recognizable and fantastic moments. The film's last minute breakdown is really the loss of such clever details.Overall Rating: 6.4",6,1,1,9 March 2018

Deadpool," Deadpool
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter the horrible representation of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, we finally get the Deadpool we always wanted. The film is hilarious, gruesome, graphic, and did I mention hilarious? The story is a basic revenge plot but the characters make the film amazing. The jokes used throughout the film are mostly solid. The use of graphic violence and language add to the hilarity. The fourth wall breaks are amazing. The opening credit scene is amazing.The acting is very good. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. He imbodies Deadpool and he does so in a believable way. Ed Skrein, despite his bad performance in Transporter: Refueled, is actually a great actor. He plays a really good bad guy. Morena Baccarin also performs well as Wilson's love interest. Karan Soni, Stefan Kapicic, Brianna Hildebrand, and T.J. Miller all perform very well.The pacing is very fast. We are instantly throw into the movie with some funny jokes and brutal violence. The runtime is not overly long.Deadpool is a perfect blend of action, comedy, and violence. I did find some of the jokes not very funny and the story was a little cliché.Pros: A perfect blend of action and comedy, brutal violence, amazing characters, hilarious jokes, fourth wall breaks, good acting, an amazing performance by Ryan Reynolds, fast pacing, and a short runtimeCons: Some of the jokes were not funny and the plot was a little cliché Overall Rating: 8.7",9,2,3,27 May 2018
Annihilation," Annihilation
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerAfter seeing the trailer, I was thoroughly intrigued and had to see this film. After watching the movie, I was utterly confused at what I had just seen. When I got home I looked up an explanation video on YouTube and it helped clear things us immensely.The story is very complex and detailed orientated which makes it hard to follow. The sci-fi and mystery part of the film is great. The horror aspect of the movie is nonexistent because it is not very scary. The build up to the ending is the best part of the film. The ending is weird and very strange to say the least. I personally believe that this film has a lot of personal interpretation to it. The ending can mean what you want it to mean. The science aspect of the film is also a high point of the film.The acting is very good. Natalie Portman delivers a stunning performance as a woman in search of redemption, answers, and finding her true love. Oscar Isaac, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tuva Novotny, Tessa Thompson, and Benedict Wong all perform very well. Gina Rodriguez performs the worst. She is a cliché female side character who thinks she is badass and tough. She is painfully annoying and I was happy when she died.The pacing is great. The film slowly builds up the tense and the story. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Complex and interesting story, good combination of sci-fi and mystery, the building up for the ending was great, Natalie Portman's performance, good overall acting, and good pacingCons: A somewhat too complex story, weird ending, Gina Rodriguez and her terrible performance, and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 7.8P.S. I would highly recommend watching an explanation video on YouTube. It helped clear things up immensely.",8,14,30,13 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerVery few sequels have been better than the first film. This film is better than the first. Empire tells a much darker story then the first Star Wars. It is still very complex and has amazing battle scenes. This films story shows us how evil can win and how good cannot always triumph over evil.The acting is very good.

Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher once again perform perfectly.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.The special effects are amazing and the music is incredible.

Goodfellas," Goodfellas
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerMartin Scorsese has made some of my all time favorite films. Goodfellas is one of my favorites. The story is slick, funny, brutal, and memorable. The dialogue is sharp and fluid. The characters are deep, relatable, and unique. The acting is masterful. Ray Liotta gives the best performance of his career. Robert De Niro, as always, performs best as a gangster. Joe Pesci gives one of his best performances as the loose cannon Tommy. All the other actors in the film perform masterfully.The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect. Everything about this film is perfect.The only downside to this film is that the violence is a little outdated.Pros: Slick, funny, brutal, and memorable story, fluid dialogue, unique characters, masterful acting, perfect pacing, and a good runtimeCons: Some of the violence is outdatedOverall Rating: 9.6",10,2,4,19 May 2018
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead II
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe story picks up right after the first film. The first seven minutes of the film are a recap of the first film with some minor changes. The story in this movie is way better then the first. The entire movie is full of suspense and thrills.The acting is once again B movie quality. There are some humorous senses throughout, but the over the top acting kinda makes not funny. Bruce Campbell's character Ash does have some awesome senses which make him seem like a badass.The gore and the monsters are the best part of this film. The monsters are detailed, hideous creatures that bring a great sense of terror. The gore is also great.Pros: Compelling story, awesome monsters, fast pacing, some humorous parts, Bruce Campbell's Ash is bad, and great use of goreCons: B movie acting and an over the top ending that seemed out of placeOverall Rating: 8.0",8,2,2,29 January 2018

The Godfather," The Godfather
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerIt should be noted that The Godfather was the first gangster/mobster movie I had ever seen. I was 17 years old when I first saw it and it blew me away. Francis Ford Coppola transports you into the world of the Corleone family. He masterfully introduces use the memorable characters and settings that become classics in cinema history. The story is full of twists that you stunned and the flow of the film is elegant and graceful. The acting is masterful. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, and many others all perform perfectly. They all add to story and are all unique. They are some of the best characters in cinema.The pacing is perfect. Coppola takes his time creating his characters and settings. The runtime is very long but I found it to go by rather quickly because of the interesting and intense story.Pros: Masterful storytelling, memorable characters, amazing acting, perfect pacing, and a good runtimeCons: NoneOverall Rating: 10",10,1,2,14 May 2018
