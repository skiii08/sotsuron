The Lobster," Don't watch it if you're single
","Watched this movie a few days ago, and I hardly write reviews but felt the need to put the above disclaimer out there, starts of sad, gets sadder, and ends on an even more depressing note. so yeah couples go ahead, oh and scarce on the science element, 6 for the good acting/direction and innovative concept. There's scope in this genre'.",6,0,1,29 September 2017
Wind River," One of the best movies of 2017
","i waited a long time to watch this movie, and it was defiantly worth the wait. Riveting, Scenic and absolutely Brilliant. Acting, direction and cinematography were all top class. Probably Jeremy Renner's best performance till date.The scenic views in the film were breathtaking. Would definitely advise people to go out of their way to watch this. A little slow to start with, but picks up the pace really well. Some people might argue it was a little too sad but that's just because of the strong message the movie carried with it.

Southpaw," pretty good if you have a free Sunday
","Pretty much a decent boxing flick, with good performances from all three lead actors.If you're a boxing fan you are in for a treat as the boxing scenes were exceptionally good.Gets a bit predictable and boring in the middle but somehow still maintains a pretty strong story line.Definitely watch if you are a sports fan and for those who aren't, they may still enjoy it.RECOMMENDATION PERCENTAGE: 63%",6,0,0,5 November 2017
