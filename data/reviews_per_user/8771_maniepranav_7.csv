Blade Runner 2049," A modern classic.
","The original Blade Runner is great in many ways, but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it a lot because of the horribly slow pace. Great world-building, characters and all can only get you so far, in my opinion. The movie dragged on a lot. However, I was intrigued by how one could design something like this, so I was excited for the sequel.2049 was a sequel I never knew I needed, or one that I thought would be better than the original. It expands excellently on the original film's concepts, while also convincing the audience why the sequel was important in the grand scheme of things. Great plot, brilliant twist no doubt, and cinematography that deserved an Oscar, and if Deakins hadn't won that year, I would have rioted. The sound mixing was amazing, too, and the score fits the movie perfectly (my respects to Johann
Johansson, and kudos to Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallsfisch). Ryan Gosling was a great replicant, and provided a chilling, but ultimately heartwarming performance as police officer KD6 - 3.7. Great turns by Sylvia Hoeks as the psychopath replicant puppet of the Wallace corporation, Luv, and Ana de Armas as Joi. Let's just say Jared Leto was great, too, but he took it too far with the whole 'almost blinding himself' thing.Denis Villenueve has established himself as one of the best directors working right now with this movie. It's fair to trust him with any property, because most likely, he's going to make a classic out of it. He did it with Sicario, 2049, and Arrival as well. 2049 deserves every bit of praise that came its way.",10,4,13,10 August 2019
Skyfall," The 2nd-best Bond movie.
","I don't completely appreciate Q being so smart but not giving Bond any gadgets (although it does make some sense). But I love the fact that Bond became so realistic and vulnerable. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he is the best James Bond ever, period.Ever since I watched this movie when it released, I've seen it multiple times, and each time was richly rewarding. The movie was never about how cool it could get. It was about the relationships that threaten the lives of these spies. The idea of maternal relationship overtones between 007 and M (or between M and Raoul Silva) was a masterful idea. One can see the similarities with GoldenEye (which is another Bond classic), but Skyfall is an improved version of the whole 'expendable spy-turned-villain' trope. Bardem was brilliant as Silva, but it really was Judi Dench who took the cake. She played someone who knew the consequences of her actions, and was willing to live with them. She had the hardest job of all.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cinematography by a confirmed legend who goes by the name Roger Deakins. That shot of Bond running on the ice with fireworks behind is one of the best shots in movie history. Great opening sequence, all too haunting (thanks in part to Adele).I didn't think I would ever say this, but Skyfall was actually one of the best movies of 2012. Certainly more memorable than that year's Oscar nominees for me. It only falls behind Casino Royale for me. Otherwise, it deserves a 10.",10,3,6,13 August 2019
The Irishman," The perfect closure.
","Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. Goodfellas, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street happen to be movies I love rewatching. So when plans of him making another mob movie with Pesci, De Niro, and, finally, Pacino came up, I was excited.I think I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It is by no means a by-the-numbers gangster movie. It's a massively reflective and introspective piece that also doesn't happen to be a nuanced satire. It's, well, sad. And that's the quality that makes this movie a winner for me. The idea that Frank Sheeran was most likely in a limbo of thoughts as he inched closer to his end was so beautifully expressed that it might just make you a little emotional.Despite being 3.5 hours, I don't think that even a single minute was unwarranted. I wasn't bored. The first hour was good, felt a lot like Goodfellas and just showing the trappings of being in a crime family. The second hour was even better, focusing on the dynamic between Hoffa and Sheeran, and De Niro, Pacino and Pesci reached a new peak this time. Of course, it was made all the more exciting by the plot.The final stretch, however, is everything. It should just be the basis for an Oscar for De Niro. I mean, sure, Joaquin Phoenix was great, but De Niro in the last hour of the movie was absolutely phenomenal.I think Scorsese is at that point of his life where he's looking at the various ways he can contribute to cinema. He's made excessive stuff, fun stuff, thrilling stuff. This is unique. It manages to be both fun and introspective without being too broody at the expense of boring people with long shots (I'm looking at you, Tarantino). It reminded me a lot of El Camino, which was similar in terms of what it wanted to be, but nowhere as good as The Irishman. This isn't saying that the movie is good because it's Scorsese at all, I've been bored by some really famous movies before. This movie is objectively good. And I can see why it's not a miniseries.Thank you, Martin Scorsese and Netflix. 2nd favorite movie this year so far, behind Parasite.(Just one problem: this deserved the theater treatment. Totally. Gorgeously shot.)",10,5,11,3 December 2019
Creed," A thumping sports classic.
","At its heart, Creed is a feel-good movie. It is a massively entertaining feel-good movie, with lots of great emotional moments. Michael B Jordan takes the franchise torch and leads the way with Creed, as the son of a legendary boxer who has difficulty trying to forge his own path against the backdrop of his dad's name and fame. He wants to prove something, but what?Major props go to Sylvester Stallone. One might think he would be bored playing Rocky so much. Even if that were true, he produces the best Rocky after the original movie. He plays old, wise man Rocky, who is still troubled by thoughts of death and his wife, Adrian. Creed and Rocky are an excellent combination, and Jordan and Rocky have a beautiful chemistry that can go on for years if the studio chooses to squeeze a franchise out of it. Credits also go to Tessa Thompson. You may accuse the movie of having filler scenes, but they're all great filler scenes, simply because she was in them. However, she eventually proves to play a vital role in Creed's life.Creed is the best movie in the whole Rocky franchise when it comes to technique. The first professional fight that Creed gets into was shot in one take. ONE TAKE, and it was way too awesome. It takes serious balls to do that, and skill to do it well, which this movie does. The final fight was extremely well shot, too. I love the decision of the movie to not use the classic Rocky score until and unless it was needed; possibly a metaphor for Creed's own story. The score is original, and memorable. I'll never forget the scene in which Jordan runs with the bikes soundtracked to (aptly) Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill, with traces of the score mixed. Great use of music.I didn't expect this movie to be so good. Where most of us Rocky fans would have thought that this was another cheap attempt to make money, director Ryan Coogler proves otherwise. It convinced Marvel he was ideal for Black Panther (which he was eventually anyway). Creed 2 may not have been so good, either. But this movie, much like Adonis Creed, was not a mistake.",10,0,0,13 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A weird ride.
","This was my first Tarantino feature in a theater, and I was hugely excited because of that. I find it impossible to rank his films because I love all of them so much, especially Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. I had some expectations from a QT movie.What followed next was the most self-indulgent QT has ever been in his career. It's literally a movie about a normal day in a struggling actor's career, with a stunt double and a stunning actress as a next-door neighbor. Lots of 60s kitsch that helped make the movie, dialogue that'll make you laugh riotedly, and good performances all round.However, it felt underwhelming. Maybe it's possible because of the marketing or what, but I didn't feel that same thrill I felt in most of his other movies. I like the subtle referential style he adopts in this movie, where he references his own filmography, or that of the old times. But, it feels too slow. Too much driving, for one.However, I still give it a high rating because of how entertaining it proves to be. The final 30 minutes are full-blown Tarantino that we deserved. One could say it was worth the build-up, and it is a happy ending. There's some great, memorable scenes as well, most notably the one between Bruce Lee and Cliff Booth who's Brad Pitt's character. It also has everything else essential to a QT movie - killer (very killer, indeed) soundtrack, snappy dialogue, faithfulness to the period.It's not QT's best, but it is his most experimental and self-indulgent. It's also a weirdly enjoyable ride, and doesn't feel boring for too long. It's not an instant classic, but it's a ride you should sign up for.",9,9,21,15 August 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A great debut, but not a classic.
","I watched Reservoir Dogs only recently, while having matches everything else except Jackie Brown. It is a great film, not one of Tarantino's best, or the best of all time, but still worth spending time on it.The acting is top notch. Harvey Keitel was the best among the five, with a compassionate layer underneath the professional criminal experience that he obviously has. Steve Buscemi was also fabulous. Camerawork was very solid, and I love how most of the movie centers on there being a long-drawn Mexican standoff of sorts. The cross-blaming, self-doubting progresses the plot forwards very well, and the pacing is done really well. The movie has a perfect length.However, this film does have flaws. The dialogue, while in much of the movie very stylish, sometimes feels hammy. QT could have done away with many lines, because a lot of it was telling us the same thing again and again. Of course, that has its own context, but it feels too much. The dialogue style is a precursor to how Pulp Fiction would be structured (a movie that, like most people, i consider one of the best ever made). But, even when the gangsters are talking about Pam Grier, it feels much inferior to the whole legendary Quarter-Pounder conversation in the first scene in Pulp Fiction, and underwhelming in general. The flashbacks were not all effective either, especially the one for Mr Blonde.Granted, it was QT's debut, so it would be a little immature and excessive. It also serves as a great story about trust and compassion, because you're hooked to the end. When the end comes, you will be in disbelief, as to 'Why did he say that?' But, it will make sense eventually. It warrants a watch for sure, if you want to know how it all started, especially since it was an indie film.",9,0,0,13 August 2019
Steve Jobs," A deep portrait of a flawed, lonely, but enigmatic man.
","As a kid, I was always enamored by Steve Jobs' larger-than-life personality. I have owned multiple versions of the iPod, and I couldn't be more wowed by his genius. That was until the Isaacson biography came out, and whatever I'd read of that book (which is an excellent unbiased piece on the man, although for some reason I couldn't complete it), I did recognize Jobs' flaws.After the disaster that was the Ashton Kutcher movie (although kudos to Kutcher for nailing the mannerisms), I really wanted this movie. I was hugely excited when I heard Fincher was in talks, and the Fincher-Sorkin duo has yielded an excellent result in the form of The Social Network. But the Sony hack said otherwise. Much later, when it was announced that Danny Boyle would take over (another director who's very accomplished in my opinion), I didn't think very highly of him as a director for this kind of movie.The movie was a lot of fictionalized dialogue and situational drama. But what the dialogue contained was surely true. Steve Jobs has created such an enigmatic image around himself, that nobody needed to see a movie of his greatness in my honest opinion. Which is why I loved the structure of this movie, and how it expressed those flaws, albeit in fictional situations. Fassbender was a great, great Jobs, even though he didn't nail the look of the younger Steve Jobs. Kate Winslet was evergreen, she is just, well, phenomenal. Rogen as Woz was also surprisingly a good turn by the otherwise goofy actor, and he nailed the Woz vibe. The dialogue was as Sorkin-y as it could get - rapid fast exchanges, solid retorts and burns, and ultimately a lot of closure.You see a Steve Jobs that started out as an immature person who said that 28% of American men could be his daughter's father. The gradual development of how he settled all of that was heartwarming to see. There's a lot of anguish in between, which is why it feels so good to see the movie end like that. He realizes that it isn't a binary, that he could be decent and gifted simultaneously. That's why I loved this movie. It made me have a little more respect for the flawed Jobs that I knew. Of course, a Fincher version might have been better, but I'm not complaining. I thoroughly enjoyed what Boyle brought to the table. 9.5/10.",10,0,1,24 May 2019
