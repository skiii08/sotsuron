Requiem for a Dream," the bad ending of drugs
",This movie is best movie i have ever watched.I was greatly moved by this movie.Its is directed in totally a different way. This is a movie about truth on drugs and very essential for every one to watch it to know exactly what the addiction of the drugs can cause and up to how far a person can go to get it when the person got addicted.Every actors performance was incredibly great.I was blown away after watching it and even after few days this movie was on my mind and even now i cannot forget about it. I like those movies which makes you feel to think about it.It is a very powerful movie.I still can feel it.I gave this movie 10 because the direction of the movie is so awesome. I don't know how to express about it. its totally great and must watch movie.,10,1,2,19 August 2013
