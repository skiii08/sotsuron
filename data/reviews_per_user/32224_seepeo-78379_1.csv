Hereditary," One of the best horror films.
","I've seen this movie about 10 times,read reviews, online chats about the movie ECT ..this movie will leave you with a lot of questions that can only be answered with the above information , from the funeral scene , what does the lady put in the grand mother's mouth? What does Annie pull out of her mouth at Joann's house while drinking tea?
Everything else I figured out. Charlie is Paimon from birth and grandma was a wet nurse ( gross) to nurture Paimon.. at 11 minutes into the movie Annie picks up a book with a short letter from Grandma writin to Annie that basically tells Annie that thier SACRIFICE is worth it because the end result is greater than she could hope for,,
All of the naked people at the end of the movie are in most of the scenes throughout the movie,,the smiling guy at the funeral is downstairs of the house where the dad gets burned up, one of Peter's teachers is also in the attic next to the waving lady that also wavied at Charlie when Charlie cut the birds head off,,and Joann and some of the other cult members are in the group meetings..
If you look closely at the scene where Charlie See's her dead grandma around the fire there are some heavy footprints on the trail that Charlie is walking on,,
The seance with Annie and Joanne ' Louie' is actually Charlie writing I love grandma..
If you need any questions answered about the movie please ask and I'll help you figure it out..",10,2,5,4 November 2018
