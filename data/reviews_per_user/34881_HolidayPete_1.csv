10 Cloverfield Lane," No. No.
","I am lost over the hype for this film. It's as though they filmed a movie, and then filmed something else, for what was the last fifteen minutes. What's the twist? There was no twist, but plenty of plot holes. I was really hoping they were going to tie it in with the original somehow. They so didn't. There's your spoiler. No, it's not a sequel. It's not really a movie, more of an exercise in bad decision making--by those with money to burn--I'm not even a JJ hater. This movie did not need to happen. The drama in the bunker is simply a waste if it doesn't tie in with the drama above. Those performances were a waste, too. I am so blown away that this got such good reviews. I think what you are seeing is people grasping to this concept that horror is better when it's not horror. Drama... Ugh. Drama can make a horror--or whatever the hell this thing was--great or it can make it...a drama. Damn they screwed this up.",5,1,4,3 June 2016
