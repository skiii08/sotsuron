The Blair Witch Project," Superb, one of the best horror movies of the 90's
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT wound up the unfortunate victim of self-canibalization.  Artisan relentlessly marketed and merchandised what should have remained a creepy little curiosity destined for cult obscurity. While it made the company millions of dollars, the non-stop BLAIR WITCH hubbub destroyed the movie's staying power, at least with a wide audience.But maybe this movie should never have been seen by a wide audience.  Maybe the movie's advertising should have been word-of-mouth driven ONLY.  Maybe this movie should have never been released theatrically, at least not on a large scale.  Trying to appeal to a generation whose idea of horror is SCREAM, when the product you are selling is more along the lines of grittier horrors such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, is destined to ultimately fail.  Artisan may have made a killing, but they killed the movie in the process.BLAIR WITCH is one of the few movies I can think of that works better on the small screen.  When watching a grainy underground movie on TV, one feels they are seeing something subversive and taboo.  Seeing the very same thing on the big screen comes off as overly stylized, cinema-verite gone wild. This is largely due to the overuse of hand-held photography in commercials and on MTV--the very audience of which is whom BLAIR WITCH was directed toward.Now, mention THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and you'll hear, 'It sucked,' 'It wasn't scary,' 'Heather Donohue is an annoying bitch,' 'The camera work was terrible,' 'It was boring,' 'I'm sick of it.'The last comment is the only one with any degree of validity.Anyone who did not find this movie even the least bit intense or eerie went into it determined to not let it affect them.  As far as the ridiculous criticism of Donohue's performance, her CHARACTER was indeed an annoying bitch.  She was obnoxious, loud, pushy and irritating.  In other words, her performance was perfect.Perhaps the dumbest of all the backlash against this movie were complaints about the shaky camerawork.  You see, it's really hard to sprint through the woods over uneven ground and retain a steady frame--especially when you may have forgotten you were even carrying a camera!  Found documentary footage is rarely very steady or polished, especially when it comes from the cameras of people being pursued by ghosts in the woods.In my personal opinion, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is a solid, creepy, intense, suspensful, entertaining thriller.  It moves along at a swift pace and manages a sense of anxiety rarely captured in American cinema, even during the early humorous scenes.  It's terror works much in the same way as David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME or Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE--we know, to some extent, the protagonists fate at the beginning of the movie, so the entire story has a sense of dread and doom about it.I loved this movie.  Loved it.  There's nothing to read into it, nothing to figure out, nothing to ponder over.  It is what it is.  A good, scary shriek show.  They're a dying breed these days.",Null,3,6,16 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Marginally Better than Vol. 1
","The only reason KILL BILL VOL 2 is superior to VOL 1 is because both David Carradine and Daryl Hannah have more screen time, which helps to balance the awfulness of Uma Thurman's performance.We also get the cool sequence in which Thurman undergoes her training with the master swordsman, which is shot like a gritty seventies Shaw Bros. kung fu flick. The entire sequence, however, winds up serving little more purpose than to explain how she gets out of her impossible situation of being buried alive at the hands of grunt Michael Madsen (playing a more down and out version of the same character he always plays).Her ability in punching through a plank of wood from a short distance comes in handy when she has to punch through the coffin lid. Of course, this doesn't explain how she's able to punch through the ton of dirt that's been piled on top of it.Hannah shines in her best role in years as the ruthless one-eyed assassin who kills Madsen for giving Thurman such an unceremonious death, despite the fact that she herself was all ready to kill her in her sleep not long before that. She also comes to a grotesque demise, which, unfortunately is made far less shocking by an unnecessary foreshadowing in the previous movie.But the real shining light in VOL 2 is David Carradine. His presence is electrifying, and he carries the movie single handedly for the much of its running time. Unfortunately, he is forced to interact with Thurman during the final few scenes, with her bugging eyes and stilted delivery snuffing much of the life out of their exchanges.These scenes are supposed to be emotionally devastating, but simply don't ring true at all, because Thurman isn't the least bit believable. She screams and cries and wails, but it's all so phony it has no effect.The movie is worth sitting through for Hannah and Carrdine. Tarantino's direction is obvious and by the numbers, for the most part. The two movies together are a major disappointment from a filmmaker who's capable of delivering far better material.Oh, by the way, 'Q and U' stands for Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman. Isn't that clever?",5,3,8,18 March 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An extended Tom Green Show Skit with very few laughs
","I simply don't get BORAT. I didn't find it offensive or shocking, though it did it's damnedest to be both. I also didn't find it very funny. I chuckled occasionally and laughed out loud two or three times, but other than that I found the movie to be boring, repetitive and irritatingly sophomoric.It seems like I watched a very different movie than all the people who called it 'original, edgy, intelligent' or any other such adjective. I found it to be yet another base, uninspired movie the makers of which are under the impression that simply being tasteless and gross is in itself funny. The whole concept was nothing more than an extended Tom Green Show skit, just raunchier and admittedly more outrageous.The only scene in the entire movie that made me laugh heartily was the scene in which kids run up to Borat's ice cream truck, unaware that there is a bear inside that he has bought as a guard dog. The bear roars at the kids who run away screaming. The scene is funny as hell, and it's a purely slapstick moment with no hint of nastiness. Imagine that? Similarly, the only really funny scenes are the more innocuous jokes such as Borat discovering his partner working as an Oliver Hardy look-alike in Hollywood or the pair mistakenly believing that their hosts at a bed & breakfast have transformed into cockroaches. Other than an undeniably funny nude wrestling match, the more tasteless 'jokes' fall flat.The most interesting thing about BORAT is that most of the people in it were unaware that the movie was a mockumentary, believing 'Borat' to be a real person. This leads to many people revealing a very ugly side of themselves (which, along with the prospect of making some money, led to many lawsuits against the filmmakers), such as a coordinator at a rodeo commending Borat's homeland's treatment of homosexuality as an offense punishable by death.Overall, BORAT is simply not very funny. It's too long, loses steam very early on and then just keeps going. Yeah, it has its moments, but I don't believe Sasha Baron Cohen to be the comic genius that many are calling him. He's funny, he's clever, he's certainly fearless. But he doesn't know when to quit. That's a problem with quite a bit of Hollywood product these days, regardless of genre. Cohen probably thinks one cannot take things too far. I suppose that's subjective, because I definitely think there is such a thing as too much.",4,0,1,16 July 2009
Gremlins," One of the greatest jokes ever played on an audience
","GREMLINS is one of the foulest, nastiest and most mean-spirited movies ever made.  It is a sick joke disguised as a kids movie, and one of my all-time favorite 'f*** you' movies.  This movie is designed to get back at parents too stupid or lazy to bother checking out what they are taking their kids to see by giving their kids nightmares.The first half of the movie is a saccharine-laden cute-fest, with all the ear-marks of the usual Spielberg-produced kid fodder.  Cute little Gizmo wears a Santa Claus hat, sings pretty songs and plays under the Christmas tree.  Pretty soon, he spawns nastier and more mischievous  Mogwais, but even they are pretty cute.And then...The Mogwais turn into hideous reptilian creatures which viciously attack people with knives, chainsaws and crossbows.  They are dispatched by being blown up in the microwave or shredded in a food processor. 
I loved it.  I saw it when I was twelve, so I was old enough to take it. One of the best moments in my entire movie-going life has to be when almost every child in the theater screamed in terror when the Gremlin exploded in the microwave.  And, as an ultimate 'you brought this on yourself' lesson to apathetic parents, the movie announces to the world that there is no Santa Claus.This is not a kids movie.  This is an anti-kid movie. Bravo.",Null,0,1,10 February 2004
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I have never wanted to like a movie so much, but...
","I cannot put my finger on what turned me off of Perks of Being a Wallflower. I lived in Pittsburgh in the 80s through the 90s, was friends with the other misfits in high school and college and even performed in the cast of The Rocky Horror Picture Show for a couple of years. This movie is pretty much about me and my friends.The cast all did marvelous work, particularly the three leads who all turn in rich, understated performances. There is some wonderful dialog, even a few lines that I would go so far as to call brilliant (e.g. 'we accept the love we think we deserve' and 'I feel infinite') and the movie is shot in a creative and cinematic way without ever getting flashy.And yet I found myself oddly unmoved and disconnected from the characters and their plight. Moments that were supposed to be emotional and poignant came off as trite and tedious to me. Maybe it was because it was really nothing I had not already seen or that I didn't quite believe it. Maybe it's because as an adult I am kind of embarrassed at what a slacker I was at the time and the movie brings back bad memories of that period in my life.I'm not sure, but whatever it is the movie just never clicked with me. I'm disappointed about that, because I was expecting a really profound experience watching it. Maybe that's it. Maybe I am too close to it to objectively experience it.Perks of Being a Wallflower has some great things going for it. I really, really wanted to like it, but unfortunately I didn't. I feel compelled to recommend it anyway, as it will probably mean more to others than it did to me.",6,1,5,23 May 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still Blows Me Away to this Day
","E.T. is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie blew me out of my seat as a kid, and still kills me every time I watch it. Only four or five movies have made me cry, much less sob uncontrollably. When I returned from seeing E.T. for the first time, I couldn't talk for the rest of the day. I laid in my bed and cried for about five hours.The movie still makes tears well up in my eyes and gives me a lump in my throat. I still find it profoundly moving. It's heart-breakingly sad, yet phenomenally uplifting at the same time. I had no idea a movie could be so powerful when I saw this in the movies for the first time when I was eleven.What I think makes E.T. so powerful for me now is the heart-wrenching way it has of making me long to be a kid again. I refuse to ever completely grow up, and my memories are my own, but man does this movie make me wish I was eleven again, when riding my bike was a pleasure, Matchbox cars were the greatest thing in the world, Halloween was a night of mystery and creepy fun I looked forward to all year, going to the movies was an adventure, and looking up at the stars could be a mind-blowing experience.E.T. keeps those feeling alive for me. So do a lot of other things, but E.T. is the champ. As much as my cynical adult side may want to slap Steven Spielberg around sometimes, I would happily give him a hug for his timeless gift to the world, E.T.

Underworld," Surprisingly strong fantasy movie
","When I first saw the previews, I immediately thought, okay, THE MATRIX with vampires and werewolves. I must admit, I only went to see it because my wife wanted to. I was quite surprised at how entertaining it was.There's some great effects, some terrific action sequences, but the story itself is actually intriguing. I could have done without one or two (or five or six) of the gun battles, as more hand-to-claw combat would have been much more satisfying. I'm also a tad tired of seeing characters (vampire or not) dressed in black leather. That whole clichÃ© has really worn out its welcome. So, for that matter, has the 'gothic, rainy city' locale. But, it serves a purpose in the opening scenes, as, apparently, you can tell werewolves from regular people because they don't use umbrellas.Despite these nitpicks, I enjoyed the movie immensely. It was intense, fun, even scary at times. I was also VERY pleased to see such spare use of CGI. Other than the scenes of the werewolves scurrying down walls (since when can werewolves defy gravity) or transforming, most of the werewolf effects are done with make-up and prosthetics. It just proves that computer animation is no match for talent and ingenuity with some foam rubber and latex.Great movie, check it out.",Null,0,0,3 October 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Didn't this movie already come out as 28 DAYS LATER?
","**POSSIBLE SPOILER**This movie is less of a loose remake of George Romero's infinitely superior original than a not-so-subtle rip off of 28 DAYS LATER. It's even shot the same way. Then, to add insult to injury, there's a BLAIR WITCH rip off over the end credits. Despite that, the movie does have its merits, albeit few.The opening scenes are great, then it's a sketchy ride the rest of the way. There are some truly great moments, and the tone of the movie is winningly basic, but this is supposed to be a remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD, and therefore the lack of any of the original's depth or subtext is disappointing. The remakes of THE THING and THE FLY and CAPE FEAR took the original stories and reworked them, expanded on them and took them in new directions. This one doesn't. It takes the most threadbare elements of the original movie's story and stretches them out to ninety minutes. The rich characterizations and witty screenplay are absent here. The script is clichéd and one-note and the characters are the most one-dimensional I can recall seeing in a movie in years.James Gunn is obviously a talented writer. He wrote Troma's best movie (TROMEO AND JULIET) and obviously is capable of writing that is far more interesting and challenging than this. Let's not even get into the egregiously awful SCOOBY-DOO movies.DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004 is a pefectly okay zombie movie in its own right. It's better than, say, Umberto Lenzi's NIGHTMARE CITY or even the Australian disappointment UNDEAD. But that isn't saying much. If Gunn just wants to write screenplays for cash from now on, instead of writing anything with meaning or depth, that's fine. Just one more promising artist to throw onto the ever growing heap of hacks-for-hire.",6,1,2,19 April 2004
Hostel," Slicker, more expensive unofficial entry in the GUINEA PIG series
","HOSTEL may be effectively horrific to your average moviegoer who has never seen any of the notorious Japanese underground horror/gore GUINEA PIG movies. For those who don't know, these movies are virtually plot less, shot-on-video movies depicting women being tortured, dismembered and murdered.Writer-director Eli Roth adds a story and snappy Tarantino-ish dialog to this obscure subgenre of extreme horror, but little else. Anyone who's seen more than one of these movies will find nothing in HOSTEL particularly shocking.That's not to say the movie is entirely ineffective. There are some creepy moments, impressive make-up effects and clever story elements. I thought the trio of guys getting laid and smoking pot for the entire first half of the movie, juxtaposed with the scenes of torture, mutilation and murder during the second half was a clever comment on what constitutes subversive behavior for different classes of people. College aged guys go to Amsterdam, hook up with beautiful girls and get high; older, more socially refined men go to the Ukraine and pay for the privilege of torturing an innocent person to death.Unfortunately, Roth doesn't do a whole lot with this intriguing set-up, and the movie's final moments fall in to the usual chase and revenge clichés.Despite its similarity to the GUINEA PIG series, the movie that HOSTEL most reminds me of is Joel Reed's sleazefest BLOODSUCKING FREAKS. In fact, it is, in a way, simply a more elaborate, less misogynistic remake of Reed's movie. Like FREAKS, it also attempts to excuse its outlandish gore by purporting to be a pseudo-hip black comedy. The GUINEA PIG movies, love them or hate them, are what they are. They do not pretend to be anything else but tasteless exercises in extreme gore and sleaze, and do not apologize for it.Roth doesn't have the courage to go all the way. He backs off, sprinkling the movie with hip, snappy dialog, stereotypical horror movie clichés and creepy music to remind the audience (and himself) it's all make believe, it's not to be taken seriously, it's safe.If there's one thing to be said for such sickening exercises in extreme horror as GUINEA PIG, MEN BEHIND THE SUN, CANNIBAL FEROX, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and AUGUST UNDERGROUND, it's that they don't make excuses for themselves. They exist to disgust and shock the viewer, nothing more. Roth obviously wanted to make one of these movies himself with HOSTEL. But he doesn't have the stomach to get down there in the cinematic sewer to do it, preferring to keep his hands clean and distance himself from his own subject matter.You can't pretend to be shameless. Roth tries and fails. Still, HOSTEL is worth a look.",6,0,0,17 May 2006
Silent Hill," Finally, a real horror movie!
","SILENT HILL is one of the best horror movies of the past twenty years. Unlike many other recent 'horror' movies, which are more fantasy, action or thrillers with some blood and guts, SILENT HILL is a full-blooded exercise in nightmarish and surrealistic horror. It is the movie that HELLRAISER was trying to be.A mother and father are trying to deal with their adopted daughters dangerous sleepwalking affliction. The girl repeatedly shouts the name of the town from which she came ('Silent Hill'), and the mother believes that taking her to Silent Hill may be the catharsis she needs to snap out of her dementia.The two of them drive to Silent Hill, against the father's wishes, and crash the car when they try and avoid a mysterious figure crossing the road. The mother wakes up hours later and sees that her daughter is missing... and Silent Hill has become some sort of nightmare alternate dimension plagued by monsters, mutants and creepy street people.The movie captures the look and atmosphere of the video game without ever coming off like a filmed session of game play. Other game adaptations have fallen into the trap of seeming like little more than watching someone else play the game, which is not particularly interesting or entertaining. SILENT HILL has intelligent dialog, intriguing characters and a fully developed plot to add muscle to its astonishing visuals. It's not just one gory, bizarre set-piece after another; it's a surreal visual feast held together by a compelling story and strong performances. The screenplay is the movie's only real liability, as screenwriter Roger Avery tries to incorporate the video game's stilted, melodramatic dialog into the action. It works in short spurts in the game, but simply doesn't translate to the cinema.SILENT HILL ignores both the unfortunate move toward 'extreme' horror and the tendency of horror movies to pull punches for fear of offending the audience. Political correctness and a need to repulse the audience with gruesome but pointless imagery isn't to be found in SILENT HILL. This is true horror, pure and uncompromising. Horror is like rock & roll: it's about breaking boundaries and not worrying what's going to sell in middle America. If they had given Lucio Fulci $50 Million, he might have made a movie like this. I highly recommend this movie for hard-core horror fans.More casual audiences and younger kids may not be ready for it.",8,1,3,1 May 2006
Final Destination 2," More creative carnage is the only improvement
","Read my review of the first FINAL DESTINATION, because this is the same movie. Same terrible dialog, same vacuous performances, same convoluted and illogical screenplay. Both movies take a potentially interesting concept and do nothing with it, basically striving to be little more than rip-offs of THE OMEN.The only thing that could possibly be thought of as an improvement over the first one is the passably creative death sequences. One gets the feeling that they were the first things written, and the flimsiest excuse for a story was molded around them to pad the movie out to ninety minutes.And I would be far more shocked to see a movie that DIDN'T have a twist ending, not that the 'twist' was anything I didn't see coming a mile away.I suppose, if you're extremely stupid, you might find some entertainment value in this crap. However, if you graduated from elementary school, try something more challenging, like POLICE ACADEMY.",2,0,3,8 July 2005
Forrest Gump," Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film
","FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell. Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write 'Imagine' without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob.",Null,25,54,16 September 2004
The Thing," On par with Hawks' original; Carpenter's Best
","When people these days say, 'Hey, did you ever see THE THING?' most people probably think they are referring to John Carpenter's brilliant re-adaptation (NOT remake) of the story 'Who Goes There?', which was the basis for Howard Hawks' equally brilliant 1951 original.  Both movies are triumphs of atmosphere, pacing and suspense, but the limitations set on filmmakers in the fifties forced Hawks' production to require much more of a reliance on suggestion and clever use of editing to bring its rarely seen monster to life.  Carpenter, known even then for his ability to scare without resorting to the graphic violence and gore most horror movies offered up, finally gave in to Hollywood's embracement of gore and filled his movie to vomiting with some of the most disgusting imagery ever seen in a major studio release.  However, unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH and other exploitation quickies, THE THING's effects were at least as frightening and nightmarish as they were gross, fit the intensity of the movie perfectly, and worked thematically to physically represent the decay and mutation that occurs within people when trust, friendship and security is destroyed.  Both movies are rich in substance and style, and would make a killer double feature.",Null,0,1,12 February 2003
Van Helsing," A Spit in the Face to all Classic Monster Fans
","There are three things I liked about VAN HELSING: the first ten minutes, Kate Beckinsale's ass, and... actually, those two are it, unless you count each butt cheek separately.What is with Hollywood? Why are they incapable of making action or horror movies of anything remotely resembling quality? Why do they feel that a couple of 'popular-this-month' stars and overuse of lousy CGI effects make a movie? The fact that this movie is doing as well as it is just tells me that general American audiences are morons.The director of this abominable piece of crap deserves to be drawn and quartered. I have never seen a movie that set up so many potentially great scenes, then proceeded to do nothing with them. You've got a movie featuring Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster, and the monsters never fight? Frankenstein's monster gets to beat up a female vampire in an all-too brief scene, Dracula and Van Helsing-turned-werewolf also duke it out in a mind-numbingly dull CGI-laden battle that looks like a video game. And why does Dracula have to turn into a giant bat monster to fight a werewolf. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to juxtapose Dracula in his human form duking it out with a hulking werewolf? Sure it would, which, I guess, is why they didn't do it. They're not interested in pleasing monster movie fans. They're interested in holding the attention of video game-jaded pre-teenagers. ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN had more effective action in it.The beginning of the movie is great. Shot in beautiful black and white (which contemporary audiences are far too stupid to appreciate), it plays like a loving tribute to the classic Universal monster movies. However, it comes off like a mean joke to everyone who actually believed the filmmakers who swore this movie was in the spirit of the Universal and Hammer monster movies, when it suddenly turns into your typical post-MATRIX pseudo-goth action flick.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are both incredibly dull. Other than Beckinsale's aforementioned buns, which look great in her tight pants (which I'm sure were all the rage in early 1800s Europe), she is as boring a character as I can recall having seen in a movie. The screenplay is so awful, though, it's hard to blame it all on the actors. Van Helsing's sidekick, supposedly there for comic relief, is one of the screen's most hideously obnoxious characters in many years.It's two hours of throwing glitzy hubbub at you to trick you into thinking something is happening, and about five too many scenes of people swinging through the air on wires. This movie sucks. I can remember, in my lifetime, when Hollywood had balls. It wasn't afraid to offend. It wasn't so obsessed with making money as to forsake making a good movie in the process. VAN HELSING is a good example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. Too much money, too overblown, hokey humor, targeting the general demographic rather than the true fan, sacrificing intelligence in favor of spectacle. The filmmakers' contempt for their audience is worn on their sleeve.And who thought Mr. Hyde should look like Shrek?",2,0,0,11 May 2004
Spider-Man," Okay, but far from Raimi's Best
","I enjoyed SPIDER-MAN for what it is: a brainless cartoon.  It held my attention, I liked the actors, had no problem with the Green Goblin outfit as some viewers did, and thought the special effects were neat.  But that's just why this movie was somewhat disappointing for me: neat.  It was neat. Not thrilling, not exciting, not suspenseful.  Just neat.Unlike SUPERMAN and BATMAN, character development takes a back seat. Tobey Maguire becomes Spider-Man because he got bit by a radioactive spider and Willem Dafoe becomes the Green Goblin because he's crazy.  But I refused to let that bother me, as the movie is supposed to be fun, not thought provoking.I didn't mind the hokey humor, because it captured the flavor of the comic book.  I thought all the dialogue, pacing and romance had a very comic book feel to it, which is what the movie was striving for.  So why did I not like it very much?The sole reason lies in the special effects.  I'm not the biggest fan of CGI in general, but if it's done well (as in the astonishing STARSHIP TROOPERS, or even ATTACK OF THE CLONES) it can be very effective.  But the effects in SPIDER-MAN are so cartoonish and synthetic looking, it takes away from the fun for me, as opposed to adding to it.The effects techinicians boast that almost all footage of Manhattan is computer generated, and that all the footage of Spider-Man leaping from building to building and swinging between them is computer generated. And therein lies the problem for me.  It just isn't exciting.  Because I'm all too aware that it's fake, and therefore cannot get lost in it.  It looks cool, and is fun to watch, but I was never at the edge of my seat with excitement, as I was watching SUPERMAN or BATMAN.  Their mixture of special effects and live action was balanced enough to constantly view the heroes as characters, even if they were filmed against a blue screen or shot with miniatures.  But when Spider-Man is swinging around, while the 'camera' swoops through the city, it always looks like a cartoon, and the thrill is gone for me.After THE MATRIX and STARSHIP TROOPERS, CGI no longer appeals much to me. I've seen it done before, and better, and more imaginatively.  Seeing animated figures doing acrobatics in midair just isn't 'amazing' anymore. Watching SPIDER-MAN, I was reminded of an earlier Sam Raimi movie, DARKMAN. There is a scene in DARKMAN in which Liam Neeson (or at least his stunt double) is hanging from a cable underneath a helicoptor and soaring above the city.  The moment was so thrilling it gave me chills to watch.  Why? Because there was a real guy really hanging onto a real helicopter that was really flying a thousand feet over the city.  You cannot beat realism when it comes to action in movies.  Special effects usually don't cut it.  I long for the days when movies like SHARKY'S MACHINE, BULLITT, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and  HOOPER marvelled me with real-life, death defying stunt work. SPIDER-MAN and other CGI-heavy movies like it, are out to put yet another aspect of the industry out of business.  If you can replace make-up effects, production design and stunt work with CGI effects, who the hell needs people?",Null,0,0,20 February 2003
American History X," Would be a great movie if not for the awful ending
","American HISTORY X is, in general, an excellent movie. The screenplay, performances and direction are all first rate. Unfortunately, the movie jumps its track in its final moments, with an ending that, when one thinks about it, negates the entire movie! SPOILER ALERT!!! The moment I saw Edward Furlong appear on screen, I knew he would be dead by the end of the movie. I knew this movie couldn't possibly have a happy ending, or even a remotely uplifting one. I also figured out that the young black kid with whom Furlong had a run-in would be the one to kill him.My problem is, what's the point of the movie with this ending? I thought the movie was about redemption and enlightenment. But it seems to me that the message of the movie is that redemption and enlightenment are either impossible or useless. By the time you realize the error of your ways, it will undoubtedly be too late.Also, the fact that Furlong is killed by a black kid whom he attempted to intimidate doesn't sit well with me. What are the filmmakers saying? Racism will turn a white kid into an angry delinquent, but will turn a black kid into a murderer? That's a real positive message to get people to question the stereotype of all young black men as gun wielding gang members.I'll praise this movie with a 7 out of 10, because I think the bulk of the movie is excellent. But the handling of the ending is sloppy, lazy and, yes, racist storytelling. I agree Edward Norton's character had to pay for his sins, but the way in which they have it happen practically affirms his Neo-Nazi beliefs.I have a feeling that's NOT the message the filmmakers wanted to convey.",7,1,3,19 April 2005
Batman Begins," Boring, overblown, typical Hollywood merchandise
","The same problem that plagued Bryan Singer's overblown, under-thought Superman Returns plagues Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins: no character. Richard Donner's Superman has character. Tim Burton's Batman has character. Even the original Superman and Batman television series had character.Like Superman Returns, Batman Begins is a great-looking tour-de-force of visual effects, stunt work and moody production design. But when the movie isn't concentrating on one or more of those aspects, it lumbers along at a lethargic pace as we're forced to listen to bored actors playing characters we don't care about recite lines that sound like they were written using a 'screenwriting for dummies' handbook.Once again, Hollywood delivers a mega-production with lots of sound and fury but no soul. Every worn out action movie cliché is here: the tormented hero, the strained romantic relationship, the good cop in a town full of corruption, post-Blade Runner 'let's-use-rain-and-monochromatic-scenery-to-create-atmosphere' production design, editing that looks like it was performed automatically by a computer, a Hans Zimmer knock-off score, etc, etc. Sometimes, these things can work. A cliché is a cliché because it works. Unfortunately, this time nothing works.The dialog rarely meshes with the acting. The screenwriter throws in the usual one-liners, but they're delivered with such deadpan witlessness that they just come off as awkward (e.g. Gary Oldman's monotone 'I gotta get me one of those' aside at the sight of the Batmobile).The amount of wasted talent on display here makes it all the more disappointing. Oldman is given almost nothing to do as 'the last honest cop,' Rutger Hauer barely shows up as a shifty CEO and Morgan Freeman has little more than a cameo as Batman's tech supplier. Michael Caine makes a perfectly good Alfred, even if the character itself is completely unbelievable. The gifted Christian Bale, however, plays both Bruce Wayne and Batman with the same monotone dullness as Val Kilmer did in Batman Forever.The worst, though, is Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend/adult love interest. Her performance is easily one of the most embarrassingly awful to ever appear in a major studio production. When one thinks of the possible casting choices that could have filled this role, the mind as well as the stomach reels.There's certainly enough action to hold one's interest during the two-plus hour running time. But anyone who still feels that what makes DC and Marvel comic book characters stand the test of time are the rich characterizations will be sorely disappointed. There's none of that on display here. Batman Begins is yet another big budget extravaganza that's little more than a feature length music video. It just goes to show, give a critically acclaimed indie director like Nolan $100 Million and he'll be too scared to deliver anything except the same homogenized eye candy Hollywood has churned out for years.",5,2,6,15 January 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," More entertaining, but also more brainless
","THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK is actually more entertaining than its predecessor, but lacks whatever intelligence or intensity the original might have had.  Jeff Goldblum returns to dinosaur island to save his overzealous scientist girlfriend (Julianne Moore), who has gone to research the animals. Of course, his daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester) manages to tag along as well, basically so there can be a kid in the movie.  The most interesting aspect of the story is Pete Poslethwaite as a hunter who wants to down a Tyrannosaurus.  There are some undeniably thrilling moments along the way, but the movie is little more than a rehash of the original.  The conclusion, in which a Tyrannosaurus is on the loose in Los Angeles, finally reveals this movie for what it really is: a goof.  So much could have been done with this material (same goes for the lukewarm original), but Spielberg and co. decide to simply play the movie for contrived laughs and hollow thrills, which makes both movies major disappointments.  The much praised scene in which Moore is seconds away from plunging to her death through a slowly cracking window is just a more elaborate version of the 'jeep in a tree' scene from the original.  Chester subduing a Velociraptor with her gymnastic skills is an all-time low point in cinema.  If you have absolutely nothing to do, this movie will keep you occupied for two hours.  If you actually feel like being mentally stimulated, look elsewhere.",Null,0,0,21 February 2003
I Am Legend," Yet another potentially good movie killed by lousy CGI
","I have come to the conclusion that CGI is the bane of the movie industry. It is not the ground-breaking, eye-popping technology it once was. The days of being wowed by shockingly real-looking dinosaurs or space insects are over. Now CGI is used by studios too cheap to pay for sets, extras, stunt coordinators, animal wranglers or make-up effects artists.Will Smith plays a scientist who is trying to find a cure for a virus that causes people to turn into cartoon zombies. He tries various vaccines out on the cartoon rats in his lab. Sometimes he and his dog venture out to hunt the cartoon deer that run through Manhattan. Occasionally they even watch a cartoon lion capture one of the cartoon deer so that some cartoon cubs will be able to eat. Will and the dog also sometimes run into the cartoon zombies.The moments between Will and the dog alone are fairly compelling. But any time an infected person or other species of animal shows up, the movie turns into yet another showcase for phony, ridiculous special effects.Were it not for the GODAWFUL effects, I AM LEGEND would be a marginally entertaining adaptation of Richard Matheson's infinitely superior book. With the effects however, it's yet another piece of bloated, excessive Hollywood trash, perhaps slightly less forgettable than most.",4,3,4,27 October 2008
Garden State," Absurdly overrated
","Zach Braff's directorial debut proves one thing: he is just as capable of delivering boring, run-of-the-mill Holyywood tripe as anyone.GARDEN STATE is not by any means a bad movie. It also isn't a good one. It just sort of sits there. There's plenty of phony emotion and forced 'heartfelt' exposition, but at the end, there's nothing to it all. Braff appears to have come up with a handful of ideas he thought would make cool scenes in a movie, and then struggled to write a movie around them. There are a few passably interesting moments, but mostly we've seen this movie before. Over and over and over again.Braff's emotionless performance is mind-numbing. I understand that his character is supposed to have been encouraged to bury his emotions by his equally monotone father (Ian Holm), but he is not a good enough actor to convey the buried emotions lying within. He just acts like an apathetic bore, and his moment of 'epiphany' toward the end comes out of nowhere, and seems to disappear as quickly as it came. The superb Holm is given a brutally one-note character, and can do nothing to bring any sort of depth to it.The hit-or-miss Natalie Portman doesn't do either here. Her performance is as uneven as her character. Is she a quirky young woman with more insight than she knows what to do with? Is she an immature kid who is desperately grasping at her disappearing childhood? Or is she just an idiot? Neither she nor Braff can make up their mind, and the movie ends without us having ever figured her character out. That wouldn't be so bad, but we are expected to accept one of the screen's most ridiculously inappropriate audience-pleasing endings. Not since PRETTY WOMAN has a movie been so horrendously derailed by its own final moments. The utter lack of character development (the characters are barely there in the first place) makes the ending all the more insulting to our intelligence. These people would NEVER behave this way.GARDEN STATE is the kind of movie critics adore. A little semi-obscure sleeper they can pretend they took part in discovering. I find this kind of movie to be offensive. It doesn't play with our emotions, it tries to convince us we SHOULD feel a certain way, by forcing on us the outcome it wants to reach, despite the fact that nothing in the plot has led us to believe it is what would (or SHOULD) HAPPEN.That's called cheating. And GARDEN STATE is nowhere near good enough to excuse that.",4,2,4,13 September 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Awful
","I haven't see the first RESIDENT EVIL, but I was told that APOCALYPSE was better than the first. If that's true, than the first one must be the worst movie ever made.RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is a barely watchable piece of crap. There isn't a single second in the movie when something isn't happening on the screen, and yet it's mind-numbingly boring from beginning to end. Every 'scare' is preceded by a few seconds of silence, therefore, no shocks or jolts are created because the audience is given a warning before every one.The special effects pretty much suck. The music sucks, the acting sucks, the screenplay sucks, the editing sucks, the cinematography sucks, the directing sucks.The movie sucks. There isn't one shred of originality or imagination at work here. This is a movie that only the most brain dead moron could possibly find entertaining.And, yes, I mean that.",Null,2,5,11 October 2004
Mulholland Drive," Possible Lynch's BEST Movie
","**Possible Spoilers**  David Lynch's extraordinary reworking of his aborted TV pilot may very well be his best film to date (with the possible exception of Blue Velvet).  A famous Hollywood actress (Harring) is about to be killed by two thugs when the car they're in is smashed to smithereens in a freak accident.  Everyone is killed, except her, and she walks off dazed into the night.  Suffering from amnesia, she winds up taking refuge in a house, only to be discovered by a hopeful young actress (Watts) who's housesitting the place for her aunt.  Together they attempt to find out who she is, and their journey takes them through the dream-like underworld of LA.  A subplot involving a director (Theroux) getting into trouble with some gangsters over the lead actress in his latest movie is brilliantly wound into the narrative.  It all leads up to an emotionally shattering and cerebral finale, reminiscent of Lynch's debut feature, Eraserhead. 
Lush, dreamy photography, tricky editing and an unbelievably complex and multi-layered script (by Lynch) come together to create a unique cinematic experience.  Performances are top notch, though Naomi Watts is a standout; Dan Hedaya and Robert Forster, though prominently featured in the opening credits, have less than five minutes of screen time between them, which has become an odd Lynch trademark  (e.g. Crispin Glover in Wild at Heart; Jurgen Prochnow and David Bowie in Twin Peaks--Fire Walk With Me).  Lynch himself supposedly appears somewhere in the film; sharp eyed viewers theorize he is the unrecognizable homeless man behind 'Winkies'.  Many viewers found this movie frustrating (I trust they are the same ones who are under the delusion that LOST HIGHWAY and ERASERHEAD don't make sense).  The key to 'reading' Lynch's more non-linear movies is to first realize that they're central theme is simple (though, I'm well aware how open to interpretation his movies are, so someone else may take a whole other spin on them).  ERASERHEAD is about society's irrational, repressed fear of sex and sexuality.  TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME is about the destructive trait of child abuse.  LOST HIGHWAY is about a person's inability to escape paying for the consequences of their actions.MULHOLLAND DR. is about a soul who's dismal, heart-breaking reality is escaped only by dreaming about what could have been, and the crushing return to real life which brings about her ultimate suicide.  Look at it this way. The first three quarters of the movie are a dream.  The last quarter is reality, remembered in quick bursts, and not necessarily in chronological order.  Why is that so hard to understand?  Think about this quote: 'There's a broken heart for every light on Broadway.'  The same goes for Hollywood, a town full of broken dreams, shattered lives, betrayal and desertion.  That is what MULHOLLAND DR. is about.MULHOLLAND DR. is a brilliant movie.  I'm sure it would have made a fine series, but I'm glad the plug was pulled, because it led to Lynch creating his masterpiece.  Just watch it, don't fight it.  Don't try to figure it out at the expense of experiencing the movie.   Most movies are allegorical to a certain extent.  Lynch's movies are simply more so than most.  He doesn't spoon feed his audiences.  He hands you a puzzle, and gives you all the information needed to solve it, but leaves it to you to put the pieces together.  In other words, he assumes you're intelligent, patient and imaginative, and will come up with an interpretation of the movie.  It may not be his, but it IS yours.  THAT's the point.",Null,6,11,9 June 2003
Dumb and Dumber," Utterly moronic, but very funny
","I feel like an idiot for liking this movie, but I do. I normally can't stand brainless gross-out comedies, but this one I found just twisted and edgy enough to make me laugh. Unlike most fans, however, I didn't find Jim Carrey all that funny. As with ACE VENTURA (which I hated), he bugs his eyes, waves his arms, screams, flails, and seems to think he's simply hilarious, when he's actually little more than amusing (if not a tad annoying). The highlight of this movie is Jeff Daniels. He's done comedy before, but never this broad, as he usually plays the straight man to someone else. Here, though, he turns in a brilliant comic performance that blows Carrey off the screen. The infamous diarrhea scene could have simply been nothing more than a gross potty humor joke for eight year olds, but Daniels turns it into a slapstick masterpiece that would make Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards proud. Unfortunately, the success of this movie (and Daniels' newfound popularity because of it) led him to star in such lame-brained romps as TRIAL AND ERROR, 101 DALMATIONS and MY FAVORITE MARTIAN. Hopefully he'll get back on track and do some real acting again. But DUMB AND DUMBER, like it or not, will forever be one of his very best performances.",7,1,2,27 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Mediocre, even dull, but with great moments
","KILL BILL, VOL. 1 might be an amazing movie for someone who's never seen another movie like it. Unfortunately for me, I have, and Quentin Tarantino's latest is basically yet another tiresome rehash of worn out clichés from 70's grindhouse action flicks. This has served him well in previous projects such as PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, but KILL BILL, VOL. 1 is wildly uneven, missing at least as often as it hits the mark.I won't bother with the plot, as just about everyone knows it by now. If you haven't seen it, think HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER times a hundred. That's not necessarily a compliment -- bigger is not necessarily better -- and that's proved here repeatedly. In the wake of such astonishing martial arts movies as THE MATRIX and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, KILL BILL is old hat.There are some good scenes, such as Uma Thurman's initial battle with former partner Vivica A. Fox, the derivative-but-still-cool battle between Thurman and dozens of Japanese mafia warriors, and, especially, Thurman's showdown with a schoolgirl assassin wielding a razor embedded flail. Another fight between Thurman and Lucy Liu is the movie's highlight.Other than these points, however, there's just not much here. It movies along at a good pace, but has more than its share of 'been-there-done-that' sequences that probably should have been left on the cutting room floor.The biggest problem with KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (and VOL. 2 for that matter) is Uma Thurman herself. Her performance is jaw-droppingly awful, more often than not emulating a post-STAR TREK William Shatner with her contrived dramatic pauses, bugging eyes and stilted delivery. Lucy Liu plays the same character she's played in everything she's ever done, so one can't really complain nor condemn her presence here. The standout performance is Darryl Hannah as Thurman's would-be assassin. Her role here is little more than a cameo, but she is given much more to do in VOL. 2.Overall, KILL BILL, VOL. 1 is Tarantino's weakest directorial effort. It's a bit better than NATURAL BORN KILLERS or TRUE ROMANCE, both of which it resembles stylistically, but well beneath what Tarantino fans have come to expect from the man himself.I must nit-pick a bit here and say that the opening credits kind of p***ed me off, with all the '4th Film by Quentin Tarantino' and '1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as the Viper Squad' crap. It's self-indulgent film geek pseudo quirkiness at its worst. At least he was kind enough to spare us the torture of watching him act.",Null,0,1,30 November 2004
Paranormal Activity," If you like being scared, you'll love it. If you don't like being scared, you won't.
","I really, really liked Paranormal Activity, but I tend to like this kind of movie. I know that there was a something of a backlash against this movie, as there was with The Blair Witch Project, and I think that it has to do with two things: the enormous return on investment and the refusal to go along for the ride.The first is pretty easy to understand. Even I as an aspiring filmmaker am kicking myself for not coming up with the idea (as I did when I first saw Blair Witch). Someone making a movie for $10,000 or $15,000 and going on to make tens of millions of dollars as a result can frustrate anyone and some viewers allow those sour grapes to ruin the movie for them.The second reason is more hard to understand: refusing to go along with it. In other words, some people a) can't get lost in the story and suspend their disbelief and b) simply don't want to be scared. I don't mean they're afraid to be scared; I mean they don't want to allow themselves to be scared. They hear that a movie is scary or disturbing and they have a desire to take the wind out of its sails be watching it and then boasting how trite and boring they found it. It's sort of an ego boost: THAT didn't scare ME.I've now seen decades of horror movies and can honestly say that only a handful have really truly frightened me. Night of the Living Dead, Jaws, The Shining and the aforementioned The Blair Witch Project all had at least a few scenes which scared the crap out of me (The Shining has a palpably terrifying atmosphere from beginning to end).In the past ten years or so, I can only say that a couple of movies got under my skin. Session 9 I found to be a genuinely creepy movie with a few heart-in-my-throat moments, and David Lynch's Inland Empire, thought perhaps not a straight horror movie, had a few moments that were the first to make me jump out of my seat in years.You can imagine my delight, therefore, when I found myself jumping and actually being SCARED while watching Paranormal Activity. A very simple, well-made horror movie that works because it leaves so much to your imagination. Instead of throwing a barrage of gruesome CGI imagery at you, the movie creates a truly creepy atmosphere through sound, the occasional inanimate object moving and, most of all, the effective performances of the cast.While the acting has a touch of the histrionic theatricality that most Hollywood performers display these days (something which Blair Witch avoided completely), the sense of fear and heartache is completely believable. Katie Featherston's terror is tangible and later, when frustration, anger and guilt join the cocktail of emotions, her final emotional breakdown (which is only briefly shown) is heart-breaking. This then makes her suddenly calm and tranquil demeanor toward the end all the more bizarre and unsettling. And Micah Sloat's alpha male smugness in the face of this unseen intruder is perfectly juxtaposed with his fleeting moments of real fear.I like the fact that Micah never believes that they are truly in danger. I also think it's somewhat touching that no matter how angry or frustrated he gets with Katie, he is still ready to bolt to her rescue every time she calls to him. He truly loves and cares about her, which makes the conclusion of the movie all the more tragic. I should mention that Katie Fetherston should go down in horror history as one of the all-time best cinematic screamers! There is only one thing about the movie that I can really criticize: no matter how bad things get, they continue to sleep with the lights off. Simply from a believability standpoint, I would think that by a certain point, they would be far too unnerved to sleep in the dark.But, I admit, that's nit-picking. Paranormal Activity will go down as one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while. I highly recommend it for horror fans who truly want to be scared and are willing to let their guard down and let the movie in.",8,0,0,14 December 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Lots of flashing lights and pretty colors, not much else
","I wasn't too happy when I heard that Tim Burton was remaking WILLY WONKA, or should I say, re-adapting Roald Dahl's book CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, and the initial previews didn't make me feel any better. But, I went to see it with an open mind, and was pleasantly surprised.At first.The first twenty minutes are great. The introduction of all the characters is often hilarious, even surpassing the original movie at times. Violet and Mike are somewhat re-vamped, while Augustus and Veruca are basically identical, but the kids who play them are all very funny.But when we finally get to the Chocolate Factory, things immediately go downhill. There are some amusing effects and cool set design, but the spirit of the original movie, and Dahl's original story, are absent. The movie just moves from one bigger, more elaborate version of the original set-pieces to the next, with no inspiration and no new spin.Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is mind-boggling. What is this character supposed to be? An adult child? A clueless shut-in? Or just a generic weirdo? Depp brings nothing to the character, he just talks like Mr. Rogers' psycho cousin and makes a lot of funny faces, somehow managing to come off as wooden. Gene Wilder played the character like a mysterious genius who knew more than he was telling his guests. Depp plays the character like a goofy buffoon who's simply a poor host.The actor who plays all of the Oompa-Loompas is funny for about one minute, then that joke grows increasingly tiresome. By the time he's dressed up like a rock star doing pinwheels, it's just plain stupid.The screenplay is very lazily written. Situations pop up in the story which then go nowhere, such as Violet and Veruca sharing a private glance at the mention of Ever-Lasting Gobstoppers, but then nothing coming of it. It's as though the writer decided to get rid of anything he felt was extraneous to the plot; in other words, he wanted to get to the next special effects sequence quickly, and keep that pesky plot as bare-to-the-bones as possible. It's obvious the filmmakers feel that their audience wants flashing lights and pretty colors, not an interesting story.And that is the problem with CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. There's no shortage of things to look at, but once the novelty of that wears off, there's nothing more to it. Even a subplot involving Chirstopher Lee as Wonka's father is thrown in almost as an afterthought, then tossed aside as soon as it's served its purpose. Like so many Hollywood extravaganzas, there's a lot of CGI pizazz and mumbo-jumbo, but no soul.The best I can say for CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is that it is better than Burton's PLANET OF THE APES. Then again, so was PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.",4,1,3,25 July 2005
"Girl, Interrupted"," It doesn't suck, but it gives it the old college try
","GIRL, INTERRUPTED gets piled on the same heap as FORREST GUMP and THE English PATIENT; a movie that critics and audiences both loved, even though it is, at its very, very best, quite mediocre.Winona Ryder is one of Hollywood's biggest mysteries. How does someone so boring and limited become such a huge star? Ryder has never delivered what I would call a good performance. She's been decent here and there, but more often that not, she's the weak link in whatever movie she's starring (e.g. LITTLE WOMEN, HEATHERS), and has occasionally just plain sucked (ALIEN Resurrection, MR. DEEDS).Her performance in this movie falls in between those two areas. There are random moments when she's okay, but whenever she's required to show emotion or angst, her acting is disastrous.Angelina Jolie was garnered with egregious amounts of praise for her over-the-top and quite obvious performance. She ACTS, meaning she bugs her eyes, smirks knowingly and delivers her lines with the exact same obnoxious arrogance as every other actor who's ever played a similar 'rebel without a clue.' She's not bad, believe me, but Oscar-worthy? No way.And, of course, Whoopi Goldberg shows up to play yet another wise, world-weary, heart-of-gold character.The most interesting aspects of the movie are the supporting performances. Jeffrey Tambor, usually playing comedy, is excellent as a psychiatrist who means well but is ultimately no help to anyone. Brittany Murphy plays her part remarkably well. A character who is repulsed by eating and obsessed with her bowel functions could have very easily been played for laughs, intentionally or otherwise, but Murphy instills so much pent-up sorrow and pain in the character, one can only feel sympathy for her. Clea Duvall and Angela Bettis are also excellent in small supporting roles.Overall, GIRL, INTERRUPTED is a major misfire. It has a few poignant moments, but is more often contrived and unconvincing. Unfortunately, that describes most movies to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years.",4,3,5,16 June 2006
Avatar," Fun, exciting CGI-fest; turn your brain off and enjoy the ride
","I missed James Cameron's Avatar during its initial theatrical run, but managed to catch it in IMAX 3D on the last night of the extended edition's re-release. I wasn't all that excited to see it, to be perfectly honest, but I really wanted to experience it on the big screen and in 3D instead of watching it on TV.Pretty much everything I had heard about this movie was right on the money. It's more or less a futuristic remake of Dances With Wolves, with a little Starship Troopers, Pocahontas and James Cameron's own Aliens thrown in. In fact, Avatar is, in a way, Aliens in reverse, with the Marines the bad guys and the aliens the good guys. There's even a scene in which the evil Colonel, strapped into a huge robotic suit, fights a giant alien monster. The scene is lifted right from the finale of Aliens.However, despite the derivative plot, cardboard characters and cliché-riddled screenplay, Avatar is extremely entertaining and exciting. It is undeniably a visually stunning movie. Seeing it in the theater reminded me of the first time I saw Star Wars, Dune and the aforementioned Starship Troopers. The movie is a visual smörgåsbord.Cameron is an extremely talented and nuanced director and he never lets the frame become overloaded with stuff. No matter how much is happening on the screen at any given moment, he manages to choreograph and direct it all so that it never becomes disorienting. Unlike Michael Bay and Peter Jackson, Cameron seems to prefer his audience to actually SEE what is happening, instead of throwing a bunch of shaky camera movements, rapid editing and flying debris in the audience's face.The performances are all quite good. The actors play their roles with just enough over-the-top energy that it suits the massiveness of the movie, without becoming campy or trite. Cameron's screenplay is functional at best. He gets us from one point to another quickly and efficiently without ever stumbling in any significant way, but the dialog and characters are not particularly compelling. Even the subplot regarding Sam Worthington's brother being killed is glossed over without Worthington's character so much as batting an eye at the death of his sibling. The plot point is there for no reason other than to explain why Worthington has the ability to control his avatar, and once that has been established, it is more or less forgotten except for one or two throwaway lines of dialog. That pretty much sums up Cameron's attitude toward most of the motivational aspects of the script: explain it quickly and let's move on to the next action sequence.The effects are quite good, and while the Na'vi are obviously CGI-created, they have enough soul to convince us that they are living, breathing beings. Personally, I found the intricate facial movements of the Na'vi to be kind of creepy at first, enough to be mildly distracting. It took a while to get used to, but I finally did.I have not yet seen Avatar on TV. With less scope to carry the movie along, it will be interesting to see how well it holds up more on its visual style, story and characters than its sheer hugeness.I'm not a big Cameron fan. I still think his best movie is the original Terminator. Aliens is a close second, but I think the rest of his movies are bloated and uneven. I don't think he's made an all-out bad movie (though The Abyss comes close), but he often gets lost in the spectacle and neglects the story and characters. Avatar is in the middle for me. It isn't great, but it's pretty good and Cameron manages to deliver a huge explosion of eye-candy without ever losing control of it. That is no small feat.",7,3,6,8 September 2010
Saw," Another disappointment to add to the heap of modern 'horror'
","SAW looks great. The filmmakers went to great lengths to create a seedy, grindhouse look for their movie and they have succeeded admirably. There are some genuinely creepy moments, and a couple of nice surprises along the way. And there's also a terrific ending, which briefly makes the movie seem much better than it really was.Unfortunately, it seems that they spent so much time making their movie look the part, they forgot three key ingredients: direction, a script and acting. The production design and cinematography are the real stars here, and everything else takes a back seat.Let's start with the awful screenplay. Leigh Whannel's screen-writing skills are almost as bad as his acting ability. You sit and watch one good idea wasted after another. In an attempt to add (unecessary) twists and turns in the story, Whannel ruins golden opportunities for suspense and shocks. (SPOILER) The 'jaw device' scene is totally ruined by the fact that we know the victim survived her encounter. No suspense is created, because we know she'll get out of it, and her cutting into a live person to retrieve the key to the device isn't shocking or horrific, because we know nothing about the other victim. He's just some guy.Most of the dialog between Cary Elwes and Whannel is dreadful. How can you get wrapped up in a situation if you don't believe the characters? 'Who are you?' Elwes asks. Whannel manically answers 'Mr. Pretty F***ing Confused, nice to meet you!' Give me a break, please? Can't people simply talk anymore? Does every line of dialog have to be a one-liner?Elwes has received much criticism for his performance, which is odd, as he delivers one of the stronger performances in the movie. Whannel flounders uncomfortably, giving Quentin Tarantino and Spike Lee a run for their money in the category of people who should NEVER appear in their own movies. The normally reliable Danny Glover turns in perhaps the worst performance of his career.The direction is another problem. This movie has none. It just jerks from one scene to another, with no rhyme or reason, almost as though director James Wan believes that sloppy storytelling and disruptive editing will make the movie more gritty and surreal. It doesn't do anything except make it look as though Wan doesn't know what to do. The movie doesn't even really have any scenes, but a series of set-pieces linked together by the most rudimentary dialog and plot contrivances Whannel to muster.As I said before, the ending is great. I did not see it coming and I admire being caught off guard. And I enjoyed SAW more than many other so-called horror movies I've seen in recent years. But filmmakers like Wan and Whannel have to learn that if they intend to stand on the shoulders of giants such as Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper and David Fincher, they have to do more than simply try to emulate their respective styles. These filmmakers' movies had more going for them than good set design, claustrophobic photography and gruesome special effects.SAW has ONLY those things. And that's not enough.",4,4,6,6 March 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," I see the point, but it's tough wallowing through the crap - literally
","Widely considered to be the most grotesque movie ever made, this loose adaptation of De Sade's book is certainly one of the most disturbing and repulsive. While it may not be THE sickest movie ever made, it's in the running.Updating De Sade's basic story to WWII Italy, SALO tells the story of four bourgeois fascist rulers who kidnap two dozen teenage boys and girls and put them through four months of physical and psychological torture until finally butchering them after every conceivable atrocity has been exhausted. The violence is tempered by tales of sado-masochistic sex, bestiality and scatology told by a middle aged prostitute to the delight of the perverted foursome.The scenes of torture and humiliation are almost unwatchable: the kids are forced to abstain from bowel movements so their well-cooked feces can be consumed for dinner; the kids are made to walk around on all fours and eat from dog dishes; they are raped, sodomized and beaten; eyes are gouged out; tongues are ripped out; kids are eviscerated alive, etc., etc.Pasolini's intention was to create an allegory equating the fascism in Italy under Mussolini to the sadism of De Sade's darkest fantasies. It's a nicely produced film, well shot and well performed, and it certainly packs a wallop. But the movie is so outrageously disgusting that whatever points Pasolini tries to make are drowned in his own excessiveness. The film winds up a freakshow with delusions of grandeur. It has developed a vigorous cult following, but as much for its sordid subject matter and gore as its loftier aspirations.Basically, SALO is a political satire denouncing the inhumanity of fascist states led by sadistic megalomaniacs like Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin mixed with an over-the-top gross-out horror movie. It's interesting (if you have the stomach for it) and worth checking out for fans of bizarre/maverick/sick cinema. But anyone more interested in the intellectual or literary aspects will no doubt be too nauseated to have much more than a gag-reflex reaction.",6,2,6,24 January 2003
Detroit Rock City," Tasteless, stupid, sophomoric, but undeniably funny
","I never liked KISS. If it wasn't for their make-up and pyrotechnics, I don't think anyone would have given this overrated band a second glance. DETROIT ROCK CITY may not be the best thing to come out of their existence, but it sure is better than KISS VS. THE PHANTOM OF THE PARK.DRC is not a particularly good movie, but I can't say I didn't laugh my butt off quite a few times. The scene in which Edward Furlong drinks too much, then vomits into an empty beer pitcher to the tune of 'Boogie Shoes' was the funniest vomit joke I've seen since the 'Autumn Years' segment from MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE. The scene in which the boys are hiding in a girls bathroom while they listen to a cute girl crap her brains out in the next stall was another sophomoric but funny moment. And a scene in which they get a priest high on mushrooms to break their buddy out of parochial school brings tastelessness to a new level.This movie is proof that you can be stupid AND funny, just as long as you are indeed funny. A lot of comedies think just setting up a stupid/tasteless situation will automatically provide laughs, then do nothing to make the joke work. DETROIT ROCK CITY works. It might be dumb, crude and immoral, but it made me laugh. That's all I ask.",6,0,4,3 March 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the all time worst
","When the director of THE GODFATHER and APOCOLYPSE NOW puts together a terrific cast and announces he's going to make the first true adaptation of Bram Stoker's DRACULA, hopes are very, very high.  That makes it all the more painful when they burst into flame and go crashing into a school playground full of unsuspecting nuns and disabled children.  This mind-bogglingly awful mess rivals BILLY THE KID VS. DRACULA as the worst vampire movie of all time--and it cost $50 million to make!  Dreadful performances, self-satisfied, pretentious direction, a wildly uneven script and costumes that look like they were bought at Spencer's. One can't be too surprised by the mind-numbing (and much ridiculed) performance of Keanu Reeves, but one would expect far more from dependable talents such as Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins and Winona Ryder.  Only Tom Waits, as Renfield, seems up to the challenge, but his presence is not enough to help this lumbering waste of time and money.   There's two dozen better vampire movies that cost a tenth of this movie's budget, and if you give me a few minutes I can actually name them.",Null,0,1,23 January 2003
Jaws," A Classic
","One of the greatest cinematic thrillers ever made!  A monstrous Great White shark invades a New England coastal resort, munching on bathers until the local sherriff (Roy Scheider), an icthiologist (Richard Dreyfuss)and a salty old fisherman (Robert Shaw) sail out into the ocean to destroy it.  Boasts great performances, direction, photography, editing and a rousing music score by John Williams.  The shark, though obviously fake at times, is still one of the most terrifying movie monsters ever, far scarier and more convincing than the computer generated sharks of DEEP BLUE SEA, or even the Tyranosaurus of Spielberg's own JURASSIC SHOW.  A classic.  MCA Video's DVD edition is superb except for a few mind-boggling changes to the soundtrack, including a less creepy whale song during the dinner scene, and a more subdued sound effect when the shark crashes through the side of the boat. Other than that, a must-have for any movie fan.",Null,0,2,24 January 2003
Prometheus," The most expensive low budget Alien rip off ever made
","Prometheus is the most expensive low budget Alien rip-off ever made. It's nothing more than Galaxy of Terror or Forbidden World, only with 100 times their budget. I found this movie to be an entertaining piece of blood-drenched schlock disguised as a science fiction epic.While it has been promoted to some extent as a prequel to Alien, it never seems to be that, if only because the technology on display is far and away more advanced than what is available in the first four Alien movies. It seems just as likely to me that the movie is actually a sequel, taking place decades after the events of the original 'quadrilogy.' Regardless, my feeling is that Ridley Scott wanted to make another Alien-like movie and did not want to be accused of ripping himself off, therefore added a few ambiguous nods to the original movie to make this at the very least a companion piece to the Alien series.While there are plenty of the metaphysical ideas introduced in Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection floating around, and while the movie tackles some heavy philosophical themes regarding our origins (not a particularly original concept), it's obvious that Scott's intention is to create a gory freak show, with enough slime, blood, mayhem and creepy crawlies for a dozen horror movies.That may sound like a criticism, but it isn't. Prometheus is a rich, fast-paced and intriguing thriller and is as entertaining, intense and scary as any other horror movie I've seen in recent years. It just isn't as deep as it's makers would have you believe.",7,1,2,12 October 2012
Halloween," The one and only... there never should have been ANY sequels
","John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN may be influenced stylistically by the work of Bava and Argento, and more than a little derivative of Bob Clark's BLACK Christmas. ALIEN was derivative of IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE and the original THE THING (moreso than Carpenter's own remake). SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was derivative of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and MANIAC. However, ALIEN and SILENCE were both great movies in their own right, and so is HALLOWEEN. I think they can be forgiven for (at least partially) lifting their stories and style from previous works.Enough has been written about HALLOWEEN. No need to go into the brilliant direction, editing or photography. It's a solid chiller that plays like a carnival funhouse from Hell, with some of the screen's all-time greatest scares waiting around every dark corner.What a lot of people don't seem to notice or take into account is just how much of the horror is built into Carpenter's and late, great producer Debra Hill's screenplay. The story is deceptively simple. Kid kills his sister one Halloween in 1963. Fifteen years later he escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his hometown to wreak havoc on Halloween night.It's easy to forget that in Carpenter's original movie NO MOTIVE is ever given for why Michael Meyers kills his sister, or, more importantly, why he targets Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) for his Halloween night rampage. It could be as simple as her having dropped a key off at the Meyers house, and him targeting her from there.As subsequent entries in the series would put forth, Laurie is Michael's sister, and he has come back to kill her on the fifteenth anniversary of his other sister's murder. Now, this is just my opinion, but this plot contrivance takes away all of the mystery as to why Michael is stalking Laurie, and therefore makes it less scary. Why do we need an explanation for his actions? Is his being crazy, or, even worse, evil not enough of a reason? My personal interpretation of HALLOWEEN is the following: Six year old Michael Meyers decides to play the ultimate Halloween trick, not only on his sister, but the whole town. He will kill her, and allow himself to be locked up in an asylum where he will sit in a catatonic state for fifteen years. Then, on Halloween night, he will escape and find some random girl, around his sister's age at the time of her murder, and put her (and the town of Haddonfield) through a night of terror. So determined is he to scare the living Hell out of the town, that he simply refuses to die, until his night of terror is over (presumably at midnight).Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) delivers some of horror cinema's greatest and most atmospheric exposition, as he explains to Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) that somehow he always knew that Michael was evil incarnate, and was waiting for this night to finish his little Halloween scare on the town.And that is Michael's motive: to scare. To scare Laurie, to scare Dr. Loomis, to scare Haddonfield. There is no family secret. He simply wants to haunt the dreams of the people of his little town forever. Because, as Dr. Loomis suspected all along, Michael IS The Boogeyman. This is also the reason why Michael chooses his infamous 'Shape' mask: it's featureless, ghost-like appearance allows his victims, or even people who happen to see him, to project their own fears and nightmares onto him. He becomes their deepest darkest fears.That, to me, is much scarier than him having a vendetta against his sister.",10,0,1,28 August 2006
Iron Man," Very disappointing; good effects and two good performances aren't enough
","I really do not like CGI. I think 90% of the time it looks cheap and phony, an opinion which is exacerbated by the fact that those 'cheap' effects cost tens of millions of dollars. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying the effects in IRON MAN. Unfortunately, the special effects were one of the only things I did enjoy about this boring, uneven movie.As they almost always are, Robert Downey, Jr and Jeff Bridges are both excellent in their roles. Downey brings a genuine 'flawed hero' pathos to his character, and Bridges is admirably malevolent as the money and power hungry villain, a reflection of what Downey would have become if his hint of a conscience hadn't finally woke him up.The Iron Man suit is a joy to behold every time it's on screen. The opening escape scene in the makeshift suit and the final battle are both superbly thrilling action sequences.Unfortunately, what lumbers along in between these scenes is largely a big bore. The screenplay is a mess, with some ridiculous lapses in logic (even comic book logic) and lousy dialog. The tone of the movie repeatedly switches from realistic and gritty to cartoonish and campy, but with no style or finesse to make the transitions work. And several scenes seem to be incomplete, as if pages of dialog were reduced to a few awkward lines.Two key supporting performances are so bad it's amazing they didn't wind up on the cutting room floor. Terrence Howard is wooden and appears completely bored with his role as Downey's military buddy. I personally am not surprised Aat his being recast by Don Cheadle in the sequel. Gwyneth Paltrow is simply bewildering as Downey's assistant, playing the part of a woman who somehow keeps this billionaire weapons designer's existence in order as a nervous, dim-witted bubble head. She joins Katie Holmes and Kate Bosworth in the 'normally good actresses who for some reason turn in lousy performances in superhero movies' club.There's a lot to like about IRON MAN, but there's more to dislike. I doubt I'll be racing to the multiplex for IRON MAN 2. Then again, we have a new screenwriter and at least one better actor. Maybe getting rid of some dead weight will help.",5,1,3,11 March 2009
Final Destination," Great idea completely wasted
","A really eerie, intelligent, disturbing movie could have been made with this story.  A group of people get off a plane at the last second because one person has a horrifying premonition of death; after they've gotten off, the plane does indeed crash.  However, they were SUPPOSED to die as well, and since they haven't, Death, a living, conscious entity, is going to find them and finish the job.  Sounds like a great idea, huh?Unfortunately, in the wake of SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and URBAN LEGEND, the producers decided they'd make more money with a movie directed at stupid teeny-boppers than intelligent viewers.  The dialogue is plagued by the usual self-conscious SCREAM-like in-jokes, hip young (i.e. obnoxious, good-looking) characters and plot holes you could drive a semi through.There are a couple of decent scenes.  A scene in which a boy slips and gets entangled by the shower curtain cord until he chokes to death is effectively grotesque, and a sequence in which the main character locks himself in a cabin to escape Death is well done.  But the rest of the movie is as predictable, obvious and boring as any other post-SCREAM teen horror flick. The main character becomes a suspect in the deaths, a love interest develops between him and a female survivor (WOW, now there's a surprise), and, of course, there's the obligatory twist ending, which anyone who's seen more then one horror movie will see coming from a mile away.Followed by an equally idiotic sequel.  'Not dying when we were supposed to caused a rift in death's design.'  WHO THE HELL TALKS LIKE THAT?????????????",Null,1,1,9 April 2003
Jurassic Park," Great moments, mediocre movie
","Okay adaptation of Michael Crichton's dark fable about genetically cloned dinosaurs wreaking havoc on a tropical island theme park created by mad genius Attenborough.  Neill, Dern and Goldblum are the scientists recruited to endorse the attraction and wind up potential lunch.  Lacks the philisophical punch that made Crichton's book interesting, going for cheap thrills and hokey humor instead.  Contains enough suspense and scares to hold one's interest (the Tyranosaurus attack ranks among Spielberg's best work), but pretty anemic otherwise.",Null,0,6,22 January 2003
