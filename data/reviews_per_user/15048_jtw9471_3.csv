The Avengers," Average. Why they no avenge?
","So Avengers finally out but is any good. No. Not good. Not bad but not good. Is movie that plays to lowest common denominator. Only stupid people like film. It go too far, makes comic fantasy into very silly. Comic not this silly, comic in my country have adult themes and messages but this is punching and more punching. Few funny things. Mostly funny punching. There is lots of punching. First it gets silly then stay silly then feel like blaming you for being silly too... with punching. Script make sense only if you hang on toilet wall. Not make sense in film. People say film awesome. Batman awesome, has story. Makers assume you smart enough to feed yourself. This one assume dumb enough to chew off own fingers if try to eat hotdog. Is OK. Just not good. Iron man was good. He good character, funny and engaged with reason why he punching. Captain American not bad but too silly. This one just too silly. Liked hulk a bit but was there hulk film? Don't think so. Hawkeye rubbish. Heros are legend, god, monster and funny armour man who drink a lot... and Hawkeye. He has a bow and arrow. He not scary. My kid has bow and arrow. Used to. He shot cat, made him eat it. Only way they learn. Why they call avengers? They not avenge anything. They should call something else. Maybe call them justice league. That has nice ring. And cute girl in tight clothes. Nice touch. Was OK and approve. So. Not bad film. Like watching poor version of iron man or good version of Captain American. bit disappoint. Recommend for people with nothing better to do. Maybe people with little brain. For big brain wait for batman instead or read book. They are paper things with word, sometimes picture. If liked film you might not know this.",5,7,25,5 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Big monster sock creature has tantrum and you pay to watch.
","Wow. There was film Hulk from Avenger. This film not like other film in Avenger but still not mean it any good. Stars Edward norton who used to be actor but now plank of wood with face drawn on it. He so good in Fight Club as crazy man putting penis clips in kid film but must be fluke. I hear he hard man to work because perfectionist. I think no. He can't act in this. Like he read lines from inside hand and shows emotion like sushi chef serving twitchy, still alive fish to fat tourist. Why tourists so fat? Nobody fat in films. So film looking bit tired. CGI got better now and big tantrum-monster look like green sock floating around in washing machine. Funny though, he more emotion than Edward Norton. OK, so this Incredible Hulk but another film called Hulk recent. This made to fit better into avenger film (why bother, film suck so hard it could pull monkey through 20 yards of garden hose?) So it is transparent and little bit embarrass. Like advert for worse film coming. Expect temper-monster to shout 'Give me your money or I punch you in 3D.' No canon to this film and begin only flashback in credits. Borrow little bit from other and from old TV series, even gamma radiate part copy from TV so audience can relate. Don't want to relate, want to be entertain. So monster do monster things. Blow up stuff, roar a lot. Nobody cares. Hollywood can't understand basic thing. We don't care. Give us character we relate. We invest, we want best outcome for them. Green temper-monster big version of annoy actor who entire facial expression is movement of left eyebrow by half centimeter. is not good. We don't care. Pause to make tea. We forget film is paused and not because tea full of special drink made in bathtub. Usually that but not this time. And his girlfriend. Her lips massive now, she been kissing angle grinder? She eat mushroom soup? She talk soft and with acting range of a hair dryer. She like on sleeping drugs all way through. She act like audience act when they watch this. So film a bit different from Captain iron man. Look a bit different and have own style. That is good, like that. Ends nowhere and hint at avengers in credits make no sense with other film meant to connect. Plot hole you can throw a tank thought. Nobody care though if Edward Norton throw it. Just make us yawn. It has villain who have own motivation although by end of film writers give up, probably drunk on bathtub liquor. End with big fight which taught me new thing. Apparent a big chain is more effective than all firepower of US army. Maybe this is why US army not good fighting wars. Other countries armed with chains and planks of wood with nails in while they only have tanks and cannons. Poor them. So we have lots of action scene and we have CGI monster sock creature. We have explode, villain who starts caring what he does but then just decide to be another monster for some reason. Is sloppy work but basically not terrible. Better than Thor. Not good as Iron man but villain far better than Captain American. Good enough if you don't take your brain with you to cinema. If you think film should pose interest question and be artistic then film might make you want gouge out your eyes with chopstick.",6,0,0,19 May 2012
Toy Story 3," Classic comedy? Me can't brain.
","In Asian we love anitmater films, yes. I love to see giant panda do fat fighting things, there are many laughs. Toy story was good too. It was original and that is something we don't see very often, especially here where we copy everything you build and sell it back to you but breaks in 2 weeks. Ha ha. Toy story very clever and now computers do animater, whatever next? Robots take over the world now, humans are their slaves. So was amazing, looked great. Toy story 2 was exactly the same as first. Little bit different, now Woody was a girl. Woody is American slang for thing that should not be talked of to children. Why is it talked of to children in film for them? Is a bit wrong, I think. Ignoring disgusting innuendo, film was interest. Not very but kids like it and I like them to shut up. Everyone wins. Now third it out. Oh good, more toys to buy exactly like ones from last two films but now with new expensive features. Someone put jokes in and a bit of a story. Not much, just little bit. Is good for kids film. Kids like but as boy in movie, they get too old for this now. They don't want toys, they want girlfriend to sleep over. Woody is bad influence. So film OK for younger people. Still very nice. But this film in top 20 of all time best comedy. Is listed with classic movies but is just hour and half advert for things I don't want to have to buy for kids. No. Is good enough and score well for kids film. Better than Asian kids film where everyone dies. But compare to proper comedy... score is bad. Is not classic comedy. Think some people don't understand cinema. Is fine for people with bad education but if you have computer you be lucky enough to think well and should be clever than this. Film has no point. Message of this film is please buy more stuff. Not good for children really and what kind of adults watch? Left cinema thinking i was glad I saw different film and bought pirate DVD of this at station entrance from old woman with no teeth. Sadly disappointed with state of people who think this classic comedy. would score 7 for kids but would not buy more woody dolls even from market. Score only 4 as classic comedy.",4,2,10,18 April 2012
