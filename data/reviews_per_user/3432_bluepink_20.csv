The Avengers," Slightly boring until the last 30 mins
",The storyline is a little bit boring.. but the last 30 mins is great. If I was solely judging the last 30 mins alone... I would have given it a 8 or 9/10.,Null,0,1,16 April 2020
Lucky Number Slevin," I'm not sure about it
","I would say 6.5/10. It was a good movie.. although I think I spent too long thinking 'I don't get it'... which was a bit frustrating. Obviously at the end it all made sense - but I think they could have made elements within the main body of the movie a bit clearer. In any case, I'm going to watch it again, maybe my opinion will change the second time around. Some of the dialog was good... but at times it felt too wordy and unnecessary.",Null,0,0,29 March 2020
Captain Marvel," Boring
","Firstly, I love it when movies have a female lead. However the issue with this movie was the storyline. It was so boring and generally a forgettable movie.",Null,5,7,9 April 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Great movie, but too long & the story not clear
","Pros
Some of the scenes were really epic. There was a great contrast between the light and dark scenes. I also liked the use of CGI. In particular, I think the sea-based characters on the Flying Dutchman looked really good. And the villian was good.Cons
The story could have been more clear and concise (it wasn't always clear what the characters were doing, and what their motive was). In addition, I think 2.5 hours is too long for a movie.But overall.. it's an enjoyable movie.",Null,0,1,18 May 2020
Us," Good movie, but it had the potential to be even better
","I would rate it 6.5 / 10.As a whole, I really enjoyed the movie. The visuals and soundtrack were on point and it was funny; the revelation at the end was great. However - for some reason I left feeling unfulfilled, like there could have been more.I think it drills down to the main body of the movie, which fell flat and had a lot of fillers. Once the doppelgÃ¤ngers had entered the house, I was confused about (and never fully understood) what they were trying to do. Were they trying to kill them, scare them, or obtain something from them. It was never really clear. It was like a cat and mouse relationship, which was dragged out and was somewhat disappointing. I think there should have been more twists and turns in that middle portion of the movie, that could get us more engaged.",Null,0,2,13 April 2019
Aquaman," Aquaman isn't relateable
","As a whole, I enjoyed the movie but I have some constructive criticism:1. I didn't feel a connection to Aquaman. The opening scene was great, but after that... he was quickly thrown into the position of trying to save the world, before we got to know and find out more about him as a person. e.g. what does he do on a daily basis? Some context would have built more connection, understanding and likeability of the character. The bar scene with his dad was great, and personally I think more of that would have been beneficial.2. Normally in a movie you have a clear idea of beginning, middle and end (even if they're following the comic book). Initially I had a clear understanding of what Aquaman's mission was, but too many things came in the way, and it was not re-established what Aquaman was doing. I think this is a key principle for really great movies.3. Some of it was cringy and clichÃ© e.g. a perfect example is the kissing scene. We all knew they would get together in the end, and when they finally did, it was just an awkward scene and there was no chemistry (I'm not sure if this was due to the acting / script / directing).4. Lack of diversity - I'm not one to pipe up about diversity, but there were only 2 black characters who happened to be evil, and one of them had a questionable name. I get that it relates to the comic book, but because of the way it looks on camera, I would have suggested more diversity in other aspects of the movie to mitigate this.",Null,5,20,14 December 2018
Oblivion," Boring
","I was so bored out of my mind. Even during the action scenes, I was so bored. Here are a couple of reasons why I was so bored : 1) In the first part of the movie, there were only 2 / 3 characters. And we didn't see any other human beings, not even in the background. I think there's a reason why a lot of movies don't do this.. because it doesn't work. 2) I felt that the movie was obviously trying to build some suspense. But I was just waiting for the point to happen, when the suspense was broken. And it finally happened, but it was roughly 1.5 hours into the movie. Also, it was not that dramatic... and certainly not worth the wait. All in all, it was so disappointing.",Null,1,4,24 January 2016
Bird Box," It captured my attention
","Really great movie, I loved it. It was giving me Season 1 - 3 of the walking dead vibes. From the beginning I was fully engaged, and I was intrigued to follow the story and find out what happens next. I get what other reviewers mean about there being some fillers... I feel that more twists and turns could have been added to the storyline. But in any case I still enjoyed it.",Null,1,4,1 January 2019
Now You See Me," I love magic... but this wasn't it
","I was expecting to enjoy this, but I ended up incredibly bored. Perhaps they were being over-ambitious with this, so the story was lost. Too many twists and turns, to the extent that it wasn't engaging. I really love magic that makes you excited and curious to find out 'how did they do that'. But I didn't feel that emotion.",Null,0,1,22 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great movie
","Great movie... I really applaud it for having a clear structure, as there was a distinct beginning, middle and end. The story was really well told. It had a great balance of comedy and seriousness. It was really gripping and was able to evoke a lot of emotions.My only 'critique' is that I think the beginning was too slow. To explain, although I think that segment was fantastic as a whole and I recognize that it gave context to the rest of the movie (and it did that well)... ultimately, I think it would have been beneficial to cut out some of those scenes.Apart from that, I have no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was a brilliant ending to the avengers series.",Null,0,1,29 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," I was gripped throughout
","I should start by saying I've only given 10/10 to two other movies, that's how rarely I give them. This has all the elements of a great movie, I couldn't ask for more. It took me through various different emotions; and it kept me excited and on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait for what would happen next.. and it never ended.. The action just kept coming. The movie made me feel like I was part of the avengers, and as if I was being carried along this enjoyable, exciting journey; and I found myself cheering for them. I just loved it.",Null,0,0,3 May 2019
The Lion King," I loved it!
","I loved it! I would rate it an 8.5. I was fully engaged with the story, and I liked how life-like the characters were. I also like that they used a diverse cast, so defo extra props for that. I think it's worth mentioning that I watched the original a very long time ago, so I'm not comparing them; and I feel that a lot of these negative reviews are comparing it to the original.",Null,1,4,26 August 2019
I Am Legend," Amazing
",One of my favourite movies... Will Smith does an amazing job. Such an emotional story which was told really well.,Null,1,1,19 April 2020
Prisoners," Unfulfilling
","I feel like I wasted my time.. there was no real resolution. The whole movie wasj so long and drawn out, so I thought it was leading to something dramatic at the end. But the ending didn't have a big bang... the information was revealed and I wasn't particularly shocked or interested. I feel like I wasted my time.",Null,2,4,5 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Enjoyed every second
","I enjoyed every last second and was completely engrossed in it... I liked the fact the story was strong, and it was structured well without being predictable (So different things threw Batman off course, yet the storyline was still clear). The acting and casting was good and the joker was the perfect villain (played so well by Heath). Only complaint is there should have been more diversity when casting people for this movie.",Null,0,0,26 December 2018
Joker," The storytelling was amazing
","8.5/10I was gripped from the offset, even during the relatively slow segments. I think this was mainly because the Joker's character is intriguing, in addition to the great storyline and the unpredictability.*Pros*<ul><li>Strong opening. The opening scene was powerful and gave us a great introduction to the Joker.</li><li>Engaging story. I particularly liked the contrast between his life, and the fact he's always laughing / smiling all the time. And the reference to how people expect those with mental illness to act a certain way (whereas in Arthur's reality he has a facade).</li><li>Unpredictability - which evoked an element of fear and curiosity as to where the story would go.</li><li>Great pacing. Every scene was so seamless that it didn't feel that we were watching 'scenes'; it just seemed to flow as if we were watching a day in his life.</li><li>Amazing cinematography. I particularly liked the scene where Arthur was dressed in a bright joker outfit, and there was a distinct contrast with the dullness of the city.</li><li>The casting was on point.</li></ul>*Cons*<ul><li>The ending was too abrupt.</li></ul>To explain, I felt the movie just dramatically ended with a lot of loose ends left unaddressed (e.g. the apartment incident, the storyline with his neighbour, and the times on the clocks throughout).
However, the most prominent fan theory offers a possible explanation as to why it was so abrupt. If that theory is true, then it would have been beneficial to end the movie with a quick flashback to different segments in the story to clarify. In a similar format to how 'The Prestige' was done.
<ul><li>The violence was possibly too realistic and could lead to copycat behaviour. Arthur seemed to grow in confidence and find himself, the more violent he became. So effectively the violence was a positive thing for him; which isn't a good message to send the audience.</li></ul>To conclude, if they had tied up the end of the movie more nicely, I would have probably bumped the rating up a point. Although - all in all, it's a really enjoyable movie. With a great story, that was told really well.",Null,3,4,29 December 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Overrated
","It's a really good movie... but to me - it doesn't align with the overall IMDb rating. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie... the storytelling is good. The acting was great too, in particular - Anthony & Jodie were perfect in their roles.
But the movie did become a little bit boring towards the end and I was willing for it to wrap up. Perhaps because something major happened in the middle portion of the movie, and then after that it quickly went flat. The ending was bland. I've watched it twice now, and I've felt the same both times. I much prefer 'Red Dragon' over this one. I easily gave that a high rating.
But I don't want to take away from the fact it is still a good movie and was enjoyable.",Null,0,0,14 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," Great movie, loved it.
","Brilliant movie, I was engrossed by the story. Great acting. There were a few parts that could have been better: 1. Selina was an annoying character and I just didn't like her personality at all. 2. Some of the fight scenes were slow, both Batman & Bale looked old and weak (but maybe that was the intention.
Overall still a great movie, it's up there with my favourite movies of all time.",Null,0,0,27 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Beginning = Boring. Last segment = Good.
","Pros+ The graphics, camera shots and locations etc. were amazing. + When the action was good.. it was good. Cons<ul><li>The beginning part was boring. Too much of it was based around Clark Kent at work; and at points I felt like I was watching the TV show called 'the office'... </li></ul><ul><li>The real action didn't start until the last 45 minutes or so (I understand the need to build suspense, but this was too long).</li></ul><ul><li>Inconsistencies in the story line e.g. Superman had 'selective hearing' and could only hear when one particular person was in trouble. </li></ul><ul><li>It wasn't really Batman v Superman in the end really. So the name doesn't fit what actually happened. </li></ul>Despite this, the end segment as a whole was so good that I'm willing to somewhat 'overlook' how bad the beginning part was.",Null,1,5,27 March 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Missed the mark
","I really loved the first movie, although I feel that this one missed the mark slightly.Firstly, the storyline was less clear this time round, so I wasn't fully on board with John's motive and what was driving him. I felt less invested in him going out and beating everyone up (Whereas in the first movie I was really rooting for him).There were also a lot of parts that were illogical, and I often found myself questioning why someone did X when it would have been easier for them to do Y. It happened enough times for it to ruin the storyline for me.I think it was an okay movie, with some great scenes. But as a whole, it didn't come together for me and I was pretty bored.",Null,1,1,15 June 2019
