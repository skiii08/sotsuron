Requiem for a Dream," watch this movie and you'll stay off the drugs ...
","This is a very powerful movie and probably the most depressing one I have ever seen (but in a good way).The movie follows four characters, each with their own dreams. But the dreams turn into nightmares as they lose to their addictions.Because of the unique style of the director, the viewer experiences everything first-hand. We see the terrifying hallucinations of Sara, as she is overdosing on her weight-loss pills. You feel losing the sense of time when Harry, Marion and Tyrone are scoring. You simply cannot be an independent observer of the suffering of the 4 characters. Instead you will feel a sense of surrealism and despair and you cannot snap out of it. I think this is what makes this movie so powerful.Of course there is no happy ending. All characters end up in different places, in their own private hells. As the movies ends, each one moves into a fetus position, being in total despair and completely vulnerable.Watching this movie, you'll stay off the drugs.The soundtrack of the movie is beautiful and haunting, of course --- a requiem.",10,3,6,16 August 2007
Enchanted," fairy tale meets real life
","This movie has - what else would you expect - a happy ending. The movie rides on the comical clash of cultures when fairy tale characters end up in New York city. The New Yorkers and the fairy tale characters clearly have very different notions on romance. In the end, they learn from each other. The movie was actually better than I had expected. Amy Adams is wonderful as Giselle. The 'prince charming' was a bit cheesy and never evolved beyond the clich√©s. Susan Sarandon is pleasantly evil. Of course anything can happen in a fairy tale, so with the help of a kiss from the right prince and a glass shoe, the day is saved before the clock strikes midnight. And they lived happily ever after.",7,1,3,26 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," don't try to outsmart a psychopath
","I am judging this movie without having read the novel (and of course, the movie should stand on its own). I'd say that this is really a B-movie about a psychopathic criminal, albeit a good B-movie. Javier Bardem is wonderful as a psychopathic killer. He is scary as hell, with his bizarre weapon: an air gun (typically used to kill cattle). The best part of the movie is the cat and mouse game between Bardem and Brolin. Bardem is very intelligent (as psychopaths usually are), but Brolin is pretty smart himself. Of course, the big mistake Brolin makes is that he thinks he can actually pull it off to steal 2 million dollars from Bardem. Bardem portrays an exceptionally interesting psychopath, but I have seen too many psychopath movies to really appreciate it. Woody Harrelson is also wonderful as a bad-ass bounty-hunter. It was really a shame that he was killed prematurely. The epilogue by Sheriff Tommy Lee Jones suggests a deeper meaning in all the events. He feels deeply frustrated by the injustice that the psychopath Javier Bardem is still a free man. The movie ends with the sheriff trying to come to terms with his lack of power to catch Bardem. I don't share the sheriff's pessimism. A person like Bardem leaving such a bloody trial would soon make it to the 'most wanted list' and the feds would pull out all resources to catch a guy like that. In the whole movie it seems like just the sheriff and his dimwit deputy who are looking for Bardem.",7,0,2,26 November 2007
City of God," it is not easy to break away from violence in hell
","In the slums of Rio de Janeiro, where the police is either corrupt or absent, the cycle of violence seems without end. Children witness and participate in drugs and crime at an early age. Here it may be harder than anywhere else to choose good over evil, to break away from the violence. The story is told through the eyes, and lens, of Rocket. Through him we see Li'l Ze rise to power, the showdown with the rival gang led by Carrot and Knockout Ned and his demise. This movie has great characters, superbly acted.There is Li'l Ze, sociopath, who enjoys killing already at an early age. More ruthless than anyone else, he becomes the most powerful drug dealer in the area. However, his ruthless violence backfires almost literally. His power is threatened by Knockout Ned, who joined a rival gang after he kills people dear to him. Finally he is killed a group of small children, with the bullets and guns that he gave to him. Now the circle of violence seems to be complete. Despite his ruthlessness, there are times when Li'l Ze seems vulnerable. The only way for him to get a woman is through violence, and he dies at the hands of some little kids.Then there is Benny, more easygoing than Li'l Ze who eventually tries to escape the violence, but the violence catches up to him.There is Knockout Ned, who tries to do good initially. But after Li'l Ze abuses and kills people close to him, he swears on revenge. Slowly he is seduced by violence and starts breaking his own rule not to harm innocent people. He is killed by the child of one of his victims.Finally, there is Rocket. He tries to stay away from the violence as much as possible. Also he flirts with violence, but his conscience wins every time. With a great deal of luck, he is finally successful in breaking away of the violence.After seeing this movie you may ask yourself: what causes evil and violence? Are some people born evil? This seems to be the case with Li'l Ze. Do people turn evil because of the circumstances, like Knockout Ned? Does poverty lead to violence? It does seem like one need a lot of luck to break away from violence in a place like this.This is truly a great movie that no one will easily forgot. The violence, often by young children, is quite disturbing. One of the best movies I ever saw.",10,1,3,13 August 2007
The Departed," tough guys shouting profanities with an intriguing plot
","Do you want to see a movie with cops and bad guys (and there is certainly some overlap between the two)? Then watch this movie.The best part of this movie is the intriguing story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In summary, the cops have planted 'a rat' (DiCaprio) in the criminal organization led by Nicholson. But Nicholson has his own 'rat' inside the police force (Damon). To make things more interesting there are also 'rats' for the FBI, and both Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same woman. This then all plays out like a bloody game of chess where at the end both 'kings' die.This is a star-studded movie where most of the actors do very well, especially DiCaprio and Damon. I found Sheen's Boston accent convincing and Nicholson of course does his thing. Some times I got the impression that there was a bit of competition going on between the actors. Like, who can play the toughest guy.The weakest point of the movie was the psychologist who is torn between DiCaprio and Damon. The speed at which she falls for the convict (as far as she knows) DiCaprio seems unprofessional and unrealistic. There is never a real confrontation between DiCaprio and Damon over her as one might expect, but the documents that DiCaprio gives to her (not to be opened until something happens to him) end up being Damon's downfall.",9,2,5,22 November 2007
