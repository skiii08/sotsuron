The Blair Witch Project," I don't get it
","I agree that this movie has been way overhyped.  It's not scary AT ALL.  I was so pumped up to see this and even tried psyching myself out while I was watching it, but it was no use.  This movie was definitely for the 'Oh, Jaws was SO scary!' crowd.  The only way it kind of works is in the 'Lost in the wilderness' genre, but there are so many films like that that I can't recommend this one.  I had too much of a 'been there, done that' feeling the whole way through. 4",Null,1,3,2 September 1999
