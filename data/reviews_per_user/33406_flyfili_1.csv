Walk the Line," Wow!
","The moment I heard that Joaquin Phoenix was doing this film, I marked the release date on my calendar. I am a Joaquin Phoenix fan (HOT, HOT, HOT), but am not particularly a Johnny Cash fan. BUT, you don't have to be a Johnny Cash fan OR a country music fan to appreciate this film. After you have seen it, though, you will love both the man and his music. For me it was a bit of a history lesson, as well. I had no idea what the driving force was that motivated Johnny Cash to pursue music, nor did I know of his ties to other famous singers. What a full life the Man in Black has led... tragic, yet beautiful. I'm so glad that he decided to share his story with the world before he passed on.",9,2,5,20 November 2005
