Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not perfect, but this is one fun movie to watch!
","Ok, so there were flaws, but wait for the next two movies and then we'll see how just how cool this one really is. It's a shame it got the criticism it did, especially the outrageous comments like 'Jar Jar is a racist stereotype' and the like. Get a life people! This is just a silly fantasy movie. Star Wars always has been. It was always meant for a young audience, but managed to capture the heart and minds of kids and adults alike. You cannot take this movie too seriously, that is not the point. It's just a movie! And as far as being somewhat vague as far as story is concerned, this movie is only an 'establishing movie' because it sets up a lot of characters for the next two movies. And of course, the effects are outstanding. Hands down the most beautiful piece of film making I have ever seen. Looking forward to the next two.",9,0,0,5 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," i'm the dude!
","This movie is a rare type that does so much and does it so well. We have comedy, drama, sex, drugs, violence, urination on a rug... it's all here!It is hard to talk about what goes on in the movie without revealing too much, but let's just say that we have a guy who just wants to be left along with his bowling buddies who ends up in a scam that he thinks will be his big break.Much hilarity ensues.Besides, any movie that features Flea (the basist from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) has to have at least some redeeming value. Rent this if you haven't. Then buy it.And remember, 'I'm the dude!'",10,0,1,6 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," too many songs!
","ok ok, i laughed at this really hard both times i saw it. but they could have dropped or re-wrote maybe 3 or 4 songs and the movie would have been better.but the neat thing about this movie: if you can take your girlfriend to see it and she isn't disgusted or walks out, she is a keeper! ;)",8,0,0,5 October 1999
American Pie," A sweet innocence behind the smut
","This movie reminds us all how truly awkward sex can be. Especially the first time. But my grandfather told me not to worry, it gets better with age.And in the end, this isn't really about four guys losing their virginity. It is about growing up. And it makes a great date movie.",8,0,0,5 October 1999
Pulp Fiction," Arguably the best gangster movie of all time!
",this movie changed my life forever! i now have tons of catch phrases and sayings for at least the next 20 years. I saw this film 5 times in the theater. that has to mean something.,10,1,2,8 February 1999
