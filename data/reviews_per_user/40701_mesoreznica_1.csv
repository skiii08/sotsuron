The Expendables 2," The Expendables 2, unexpected result
","I sort of liked first movie. It was OK. But just OK.This one (number 2) however was something really special.This movie does not want to be serious, does not want to have real plot, no real story. It is just pure fun. Comic book hero style.And this 'something' is missing in movies like The Avengers, new Batman movies, Superman ... and so on. They try to be serious. And of course if you fly in a Blue/Red dress ... you can not be serious! Almost all new superhero movies have this obsession with some obscured reality. It just doesn't work.The Expendables 2 has managed to achieve a special feeling from comic book super heroes. There is no pretense. Just a movie full of clich√©d actions and statements. Finally! That is super hero movie.What really impressed me is use of myths, jokes, and personality of individual actors from films which are known for.Chuck Norris represents the jokes that revolve around his name. Arnold Schwarzenegger acts like Terminator (movie), Special Agent (movie) Governor (real life)... and more. Arnold (in the middle of the fight) also mention ' The Rambo' And definition of Rambo is what? Stallone of course. Leader of the team in this movie and his old rival in action movie scene. The same goes for Van Dame and his famous and elegant roundhouse kick.So... you watch the movie in the expectation.... for new/old hero to come in....Where is Chuck? Will he be the legendary 'Chuck Norris' we know? Will he kill the whole platoon with one kick? Where is Arnold? What will he be? Commando? Terminator? Conan the Barbarian? .. and so on.This movie really is something I waited for a long long time.Great movie if you understand what it is. And what it wants to be.",9,2,3,8 October 2012
