Hereditary," Unique but predictable, stereotypical horror
","Hereditary is definitely not boring, it's beautifully done, subtly directed, but the story itself is really just another stereotypical horror film, a spiritual cursed family, ended up haunted by the curse of their own ancestor, this kind of story has done million times before, no matter how many symbols you put in, how many directorial creativity you show, this film is really not that special, and most importantly, it has one of the most disappointing ending that's ever made by a film.",6,1,2,11 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Beautiful but also the least enjoyable film by Quentin Tarantino
","Before you call me a hater and press that 'not helpful' bottom, please just hear me out for a minute.I love Quentin Tarantino, I think he is one of the best director and screenwriter in this era, and Pulp Fiction is also my favorite film of all time.I can see what Quentin's trying to convey in this movie, and there're still many scenes that's amazingly acted and well written, like the scene with Sharon Tate bumping into the theater, to see her own film The Wrecking Crew, and the scene with Rick Dolton at the set of Lancer, with Timothy Olyphant as James Stacy and Julia Butters as Trudi Fraser, and of course the scenes with Mike Moh as Bruce Lee, all of them are extremely well made, and I have a great time with it, but here's where I don't like about the film, Quentin once said that this movie is his most 'personal' film over the years, it's like a love letter to the old Hollywood, but the reason why I think it's his worst film is because of his own selfish desire of telling his own fantasy, ignoring the structure of the story and the audience, there are way too many scenes that should be cut out, like the scene where Brat Pitt driving for three minutes straight there's no purpose in anything in that scene, and I mean there's NOTHING, nothing for the story, nothing for the character, and NOTHING HAPPENED in the first 80 minutes.
You may say that it's own portrayal of the old Hollywood, just like what Afonso Cuaron did to Rome, but Quentin's films always have a basic structure in it, whether it's The Hateful Eight, Kill Bill or Django Unchained, and that's what make his film so enjoyable because he knows how to tell a story in his own way, but not only did Once Upon In Hollywood has (almost) no story at all, it's just a montage of Quentin's fantasy, and it's definitely not something unique, nor is it something different, the only scene that has a sense of purpose of this story is the ending, which is amazing, but that's about it, I can't see what's great about this movie whether than a series of short films combined, I left the theater with nothing except disappointment.If you liked it than that's good for you, honestly I'm kind of jealous if you do, but neither way, I really just can't enjoy this film as it's own way, not now at least.",7,8,14,30 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back .
","Great film . Shocking, honest, well-written and lead the franchise to a new direction . Ryan Johnson makes Star Wars fresh and new . The script is very bold and fresh , it will certainly makes some of the hardcore fans angry, but I think this is the time to let it go . Star Wars need a new direction , and this film has seceded. Everyone can be a legend, but the legend wasn't always the way that we expected. It is a story that can inspired thousands of people and also entertaining at the same time .",7,1,4,16 December 2017
The Dark Knight," The best superhero movie of all time
","Christopher Norlan is one of the best director of all time , this movie has defined the new era of the superhero film , not only because it's entertaining , but also of its dramatic depth .Heath Ledger had presented the best Joker in the whole film history , he had done a very great gob on how crazy the Joker was and how indifferent was he with the other criminals in Gotham City , plus Hans Zimmer's amazing soundtrack , makes the whole movie packed with so much energy that the audience can watched it over and over again .I can't think about any other films can compared with it , even The Godfather .",10,0,2,19 June 2016
Joker," A bit disappointed
","First thing first, I personally like this film, but I wish it can had more dynamics on politics and the disparity, it just feels like it wasn't there yet, all those struggling and revolutionary concepts were kind of cartoonish to me, and the dialogues right before Arthur shoot Murray were too blatant, no character can be this self-aware, not even Arthur.But the cinematography and the soundtrack in this film is breathtaking, and Joaquin Phoenix is just phenomenal in this film, he's such a brilliant actor, I won't compare him with Heath Ledger because both of them did an absolutely amazing job, I almost can't believe my own eyes.Though I had some problems with this film, I still really appreciate this movie for being existed, there aren't enough films like this in Hollywood nowadays, especially in the superhero genre. I hope we can see more movies like this in the future, which the directors and the writers were actually trying to make a 'good' movie, with no CGI involved and actually care about the characters and the visuals, not just some cash grab digital cinema, but a 'real film' with some talented storytelling and masterful visual choreography.Thank you, Todd Phillips, for giving us this unique experience.",7,4,14,10 October 2019
