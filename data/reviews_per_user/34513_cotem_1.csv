First Man," Couldn't they purchase ONE tripod???
","Okay... I GET that some of the scenes might be enhanced by camera shake and handheld views but come on! None of us view the world from 'Shaky', the cameraman's perspective! Scenes of high, interpersonal drama are NOT enhanced by hand-held camera. NO-ONE sees the world that way -- save for those with essential tremors.We accept a few creative licences in a dramatic film but when something was as carefully documented as these space flights, it is JUST as easy to get the details correct -- and it was all still very dramatic. The spaceflights were full of errors in timing, detail and continuity.Armstrong was first because it was his turn. It was that simple. It has all been well-documented (and by far better authors than the incredibly biased James Hansen). When McDivitt stayed with Apollo 9 instead of taking 8, Armstrong got the 'G' mission -- first landing. Had that switch not been made, the first man would have been Conrad and THEN we would have has a tale to tell!",4,2,4,9 November 2018
