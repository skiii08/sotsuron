The New World," This film is about love
","People who are not interested in the subject of love should not spend their time watching this movie. If you have felt the pain of unreturned love. If you have felt the sorrow of loss. If you found you can love two people, each in a different way. If you went through love as an illness. If you find the path to ourselves can be found in nature. If you are interested in all these topics, and you actually have a 'heart', then you will not be annoyed by the > two hours of this movie. If not, I think this movie was not shot for you. (I saw many teenagers react very unfavorably to this movie. If you expect a Disney love story forget about it. This is about deep feelings.)",9,5,11,29 January 2006
Rang De Basanti," Absolutely great
","One of the best movies of the past few years. Finally a movie talking about contemporary issues, and about young people who believe in something. This was my first Bollywood movie and I really enjoyed being 'cast' in a world I barely know. The movie goes through several interesting themes, like clash of cultures (Muslims in India), a love story, contemporary Indian politics, family values... but everything is 'interwoven' in a clever way so that you don't lose track. The plot is also good and not predictable. I am so tired of watching movies that tell nothing new, with actors that put no passion, and stories that you saw a hundred times already. I am also tired of the absence of 'ideals', of 'big' issues, not only in movies but in general. This movie was surprising and bold.",10,3,7,8 October 2006
