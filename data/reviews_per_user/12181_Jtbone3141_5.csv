Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great movie (spoilers warning)
","This is on my top ten favorite movies list.First off, lots of exciting action and suspense. Take the opening scene for example. He and his partner are trying to get the head thingamabob and he gets trailed by Voodoo people (whatever they are).Another thing, while too violent to be PG, still a great movie. I'm still wondering which of the Indy movies is best. If you're a sucker for whip-cracking detailed hot action, watch this. Trust me, you'll like it. I recall a few scary parts, such as screaming skeletons and decayed bodies, people having the skin and color and blood and flesh ripped off of them by the power of God arising from the Ark of the Covenant, and a certain fight I thought would be graphic.Overall, and sorry to be so specific, if you're squeamish, you probably won't be a giant fan, but if you can handle this type of thing, you'll love it.",10,0,1,21 February 2005
Disturbia," Predictably Fun...Seriously!
","I don't wanna sound biased, but I do love Shia LaBeouf, but am not a huge fan of horror/crime movies. Since he was in this, I figured it would be worth a see. I have now seen it several times and plan on buying it in the near future.I love this movie! Okay, sure the plot is very predictable and we've seen this before, so what makes it so good? The energy, if you ask me. Shia LaBeouf, Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo are great as summer teenagers. I especially love Yoo's comical personality. David Morse is perfect as a creepy and mysterious older man.If you're looking for a good thriller that isn't above PG-13 or if you are a teenager/young adult looking for a thriller with good acting and energy, see this. You won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,13 February 2009
The Dark Knight," No Ordinary Comic Book Movie
","This doesn't deserve the title of movie. It deserves a more fitting title, like masterpiece.We watch Batman continue his crime-fighting with some new villains, but faces a new brand of criminal Gotham hasn't seen. He doesn't want money or power. He just wants to watch the city destroy itself. And he's completely insane. His name is the Joker.Meanwhile, Harvey Dent is appointed DA, and Rachel's love. Bruce still has feelings for her, and Batman, Lt. Gordon and Dent form a shaky alliance to combat crime. The Joker slowly attempts to dismantle their sanity, pushing them practically to the point of insanity.This film is a great example of watching the hero struggle to remain the hero in the face of great loss and hatred from others. Dent makes a quote early in the film that is basically the outline of this movie's plot: 'You either die the hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' I guess I can't really elaborate on that without giving away a detail that would spoil the entire movie. But this movie shows how dangerous a person truly can become once pushed to insanity, and how far someone can be willing to go to pursue their idea of justice.Above all, watch it, as it is a masterpiece among movies and by far the best comic book movie I have ever seen.",10,6,13,3 November 2008
Man on Fire," Truly Amazing-Two Films in One
","Tony Scott's masterpiece plays like two films in one: a heartfelt drama and a scorching revenge saga.The first half enters John Creasy (Washington) into a violent world of kidnappings and corruption. He is a former assassin who is bored of life and is an alcoholic. By his friend's suggestion, he becomes a bodyguard to a young child named Pita played fantastically by Dakota Fanning. His alcoholism and crankiness would chide most children away from befriending him, but the relentless Pita defrosts his heart and makes him feel like a person again. He puts down the bottle and picks up the Bible. And laughs. And smiles.But one day, corrupt police officers attack him. Being outmanned, Creasy is left for dead as Pita is kidnapped before his eyes. A negotiation occurs between the kidnapper and the family, but the result is heartbreaking, and destroys Creasy's world of happiness.Creasy puts the Bible down and picks up the gun. Assisted by a reporter and a police official, he swears to destroy every last person who had anything to do with Pita's kidnapping. Thanks to his experience in the military and covert operations, he goes on a murderous rampage against the brotherhood, La Hermandad, notching an incredible body count. He leaves few people still alive and many dead. Creasy is relentless in finding the truth behind the failed negotiation and Pita's kidnapper. And no one can stop him.Watch this film if you get the chance. It is brutal yet brilliant, bloody yet beautiful. Wonderful acting and a good script highlights this masterpiece of an action movie. You won't be sorry for the two and a half hours you've spent.",10,1,2,25 August 2008
Fantastic Four," Not the BEST comic book flick, but pretty good.
","I will admit, even though there were things I would change, it was all right.If I could change anything, it might be the fight scenes. The fight scenes were, well, there, but not enough. I would have electrified the fight scenes and made them longer, put a little more intensity in there.Plus, there was a bit of cheesiness between The Thing and the rest of the F4. The moment when he leaves is kind of cheesy, like something you'd see in a kids' movie.All in all, the movie wasn't the best out there, but I might give it a seven. Probably not higher, but it was pretty worth the watch.",7,1,2,19 June 2007
