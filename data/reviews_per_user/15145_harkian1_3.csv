The Hangover," Some say it sucks, and I know why
","Not because I agree with them, not at all, I loved the movie. I laughed so much throughout this movie, it was great. But there are those who hate this movie, and they all say the same thing 'Is it just me? All my friends seem to think it's hilarious but I barely even let out a snicker during the entire thing.' You can easily examine this and determine why these people think that this isn't funny. These people are annoying, egotistical asses who think they're god's gift to the world. The first line, which they ALL use, 'Is it just me?' shows how they try to identify themselves as unique and 'above' everyone who likes this movie. Yup, they think that they are superior people because of which movies they like. They then use the 'all my friends' line, which is laughable because these are the types of people without any friends. Then they say 'I barely let out a snicker', implying that the movie wasn't just bad overall, they try to make it seem as though there was no part of the movie, even for say, 5 seconds, that was funny enough to make them laugh. So, to the people who say they hate this movie: No one cares about what you think you self-centred moron. I hate these kinds of people, luckily I haven't known too many of them in my time. They also usually think that they are exceptionally intelligent, but their life situation, which of course matches their actual intelligence, is completely average and they blame it on something that they of course have no control over. Anyway, enough with those ass holes, this movie was awesome. If you are one of the people I described above with a ten-foot pole up your ass, then watch the movie. You'll control yourself and won't laugh at all to try to seem too high-brow for this movie, but secretly you'll love it and you'll hate that you love it because you need to seem intelligent because you know that you need to seem intelligent whenever possible because in reality, you aren't... at all. If you aren't one of the people I described above, then WATCH THIS MOVIE, you WILL laugh a lot during this movie, I certainly did.",10,2,4,9 January 2010
Alice in Wonderland," What was that?
","This movie was dreadful. The first 30 minutes were extremely painful to watch, but I said to myself 'Hey, I know this has Johnny Depp in it, so I'll wait for his character to come in and we'll see where it goes from there.' Johnny Depp's performance was pretty good, not as good as I was hoping for, but passable to say the least. However, the rest of the movie was a pile of cow dung. Johnny Depp could have been amazing in this movie, could have had his best performance ever, but it still would have been just Johnny Depp standing in a heaping pile of cow dung. I just don't get this movie, there's no, 'thing'. There's no, there's no... plot, although, no, there is a plot, albeit not very good, but it does exist. So what is it I'm looking for? Hmmmm... ah yes, the 'why' behind the movie. Why are they doing this, why, why, why. Why do they need Alice to come back? The White Queen (or w/e her name is, Anne Hathaway, that one) seems to be living quite peacefully in her castle. The Red Queen has had 13 years and has done... nothing, so, why not everyone bunk up with ol' Whitey? She seems fairly well off. You know how in a movie, there's the big climax moment that's been built up to and you're thinking 'Oh boy, this is when this all gets resolved because this happened and that happened and now all of this is happening because so and so did such and such and now they're in this winner-take-all very intense battle!!!!' Well, Alice in Wonderland had that, but I'll edit it so that it's more appropriate Oh boy, now they're in this winner-take-all very intense battle!!!!' There's no real lead up to it, it just kinda, happens. I found myself not caring about it because there was no point. I felt like 'SO FLIPPING WHAT?' Nothing has really happened to make me care, at all, about any of the characters.If you're thinking of watching this movie, then don't. It's just a waste of your time, unless you like complaining about things then by all means watch this movie, you'll have plenty to complain about guaranteed!",1,2,5,3 July 2010
Avatar," Cameron comes back big
","Wow. The immediate reaction every single viewer of this movie must have upon seeing it. This movie is a stunning visual masterpiece that you must see. I can't accurately describe what I saw a couple of hours ago, simply because words fail to describe this movie, but I'll try. Think back to a day when perhaps you wore your sunglasses for an extended period of time, or maybe ski goggles, and try to imagine what it was like when you finally took them off. Everything was clearer and looked somehow 'right' again, and you know that before while you had them on you thought that that was how everything was supposed to look, but now when you can suddenly see so much clearer, you are marvelled at how you could have once thought that. That is what seeing this movie is like. Seeing this movie is like taking off the sunglasses, you are completely amazed. All other movies pale in comparison. And usually I'm sceptical about 3D movies, not many have truly deserved or needed to be 3D. This movie deserves it. I almost felt that when I walked out of the theatre and took off the 3D glasses, everything around me seemed 'less real' and looked worse than the movie I had just seen. Other people have said it and I'll say it too, the plot isn't an original one. Advanced race meets primitive race and chaos ensues. It's been used a lot before, and the second half of the movie was very predictable. Despite that, this movie still gets a 10 from me. I found the life on the planet fascinating, all of the creatures and plants. How this world developed to be so big, and although most of the creatures were regular animals (dogs, horses) with slight tweaks (note: when I say slight, that does not apply to appearance, they look very different - very cool!), they were still very stunning to see because of the detail that each and every creature had. The Navi especially, their faces, slight twitches, everything was there, it was incredible. The creative minds that put this all together are unparallelled. I wonder at how this group of people sat down and actually created this, it's mind boggling. Excellent work James Cameron, excellent work.",10,8,17,21 December 2009
