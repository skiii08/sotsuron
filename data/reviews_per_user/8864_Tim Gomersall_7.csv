Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Like it or not, this is what Star Wars always was; fun.
","In the twenty two years that passed since A New Hope came out, the cult following of the film swelled so much that it became a phenomenon unto itself; there is no film-following like Star Wars mania, and as a result people forget what Star Wars is, and has HAS ALWAYS BEEN about.It's about young heroes saving the day. It's about bad guys in black robes fighting good guys in brown or white robes with very cool weaponry. It's about fast vehicles. It's about comedy side-kicks who don't understand what's going on. It's about dumb dialogue. It's about great music (thanks again Mr Williams, by the way). Star Wars is about all of these things, and therefore I have absolutely no idea why people all over the place are saying that 'The Phantom Menace' is a disappointment or even a traitor to the Star Wars universe. It's not! All of the classic ingredients of a Star Wars movie are there, and in fantastic style. All of the things I listed above were all in the Phantom Menace just like they were in the other three movies.This film is gloriously colourful, packed with great set pieces (the pod race should be considered a benchmark for action scenes of the digital age), full of great good characters and one really good evil one, it was set in three main settings, and had spaceships, light sabres and dodgy foreign accents spilling out of every frame; it was, in short a Star Wars movie. I loved it.I sat through the film smiling from ear to ear the whole time, just as I did when I fist saw Star Wars (I'm only 21, so I never saw it in theatres). It just strikes me that some of the people who make up the fan-base of these movies have grown up since the originals were released, realised that Star Wars was for kids all along, and feel jealous that the kids of today are enjoying the movie more than they are; Star Wars to them is their baby, and they think they're being robbed by the kids whom the film, to be honest, is aimed at.These people seem to be the minority, however; everyone who I've spoken to who has enjoyed this movie (and they outnumber those who didn't by at least five times) was just happy to let the film grab them and zip them along. Jar jar becomes a tolerable character when you stop thinking about how he's insulting your intelligence and just laugh at him as he shoots droids with a dead droid that's stuck on his foot. It's all a good laugh, ant that's what it's supposed to be.To me, Lucas has delivered everything I was hoping for. This was a really entertaining movie, and I'll be sure to get it on video when it comes out, where it will take pride of place next to the other three in the series.I can't wait to put the last two up on the shelf as well, and when they do arrive, I'm sure they'll be every bit as deserving of the title Star Wars as the Phantom Menace was. Thanks for reading my two cents.",10,5,7,5 August 1999
Memento," .film inventive but perfect quite not A
","See, I told you there were no spoilers.I gave it an 8 rating on the strength of that.I mustn't be too picky though. The people who made this film created a challenging and very entertaining movie, and it put my brain through its paces.Although the acting is good across the board, and you have to think hard, which is reassuring in the face of all the audience-spoonfeeding that's out there, I can't help but feel that played forwards it's a run of the mill story that happens to have a twist if you watch it backwards. If they'd worked on it a little more so that the reverse-viewing was a complement to the film rather than the main selling point, this would have been a masterpiece.I know it's trendy to leave questions unanswered in films these days, but there are some details that remain heavy-handedly glossed over (who the hell IS Dodd?) and others that make little sense no matter how much you replay the film forwards in your head.However, I got the impression that the people who made this film, from the writer through to the editors, were content to rest on the laurels that their novelty-factor gave them, and worked an OK film onto the backwards presentation framework rather than a great one.This film was indeed an interesting one, borrowing the narrative technique of reverse presentation pioneered by Pinter and giving it some good old turn-of-the-millennium grit.There are no spoilers in this review.",8,0,1,10 December 2000
Billy Elliot," It knows what it wants to do, and does the job thoroughly.
","(Spoiler warning regarding the tone of the film's outcome, nothing too specific)The first thing to say is that in spite of any complaints held in the following paragraphs, I did find this an entertaining film overall, and left feeling I'd got my money's worth.There were a few things that annoyed me, however. I'm as happy as the next Brit to see our films doing well overseas, but if I see one more film where a)the setting is the grim, poverty stricken English North b)the hero/heroes face ridicule and adversity at all turns c)the hero/heroes ultimately prevail on stage then I might well walk out. The Full Monty, Brassed Off, and now Billy Elliot fulfill these criteria mathematically, and it's becoming as manufactured as any formulaic genre Hollywood has to offer.In addition to being a grim-up-north / adversity / stage-triumph film, it's also hell-bent on making sure every member of its audience responds to it in the same way. Emotional cues come so thick and fast it verges on oppressive. Granny's losing her mind but Billy still loves her. Dad's a loud and grumpy man but Billy still loves him. Brother hits, teases and humiliates Billy but Billy still... you see? Every time we get to an emotional speech the strings start playing on the soundtrack, in case we miss it. We aren't always allowed to make what we want of the film, as much of it is rammed down our throats. Although shot to look low-budget and improvised, this is as meticulously crafted a film as you'll ever see, and not in an all-good way. 'Do we have a gay character?' 'No'. 'Quick, put one in. And while you're at it make sure admiring girl, Dad's fat friend, and dead mother are also thrown in there. Got to cover all the bases, don't you...'As I said, though, it's ultimately a worthwhile experience. There are a few scenes that really do pack a punch, and Julie Walters is fantastic. It also manages to make a few wry observations about the miner's strikes that plagued Britain in the eighties on the way, although perhaps brushing them into the background a bit awkwardly.Go and see this film. It's really quite good, it just doesn't want to let you dislike it. Perhaps a bit more confidence in the quality of the script, which didn't need as much emotional prompting from the director as it got, would not have gone amiss.",Null,0,0,16 October 2000
American Beauty," A bizarrely optimistic film that finds beauty amongst ugliness.
","By the time this film reached Britain the rave reviews it received in America had long since found there way over here- this is of course a mixed blessing; nothing ruins a great film like unrealistically high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to come away genuinely moved.This was mainly due to the fact that the tone of the film was nothing like what I was expecting; reviews and trailers alike make the movie out as much more of a comedy than it actually is. While there are indeed some very funny moments, this is principally a poignant film. It suggests that all we really need to do to achieve the happiness we spend our lives searching for is realise that we are constantly surrounded by it, we just don't recognise it. When we are invited to see the most beautiful thing that the camcorder obsessed Ricky has ever taped, we expect anything other than the fluttering plastic bag which it turns out to be. It's an interesting point; anything, if viewed from the right perspectives, can be beautiful. On the way home from the film, every piece of flying garbage I passed seemed that much more pleasant.Sam Mendes' direction is fantastic in its understated and discreet approach, which makes the apparently every day family's blatantly non-everyday activities all the easier to swallow. The score is perfectly balanced, at some times the stuff of fairy-tales, and at other times hauntingly moving; I am a great believer in the importance of a good score, and American Beauty is complemented well by the quiet and subtly affecting music which Thomas Newman has furnished it with. The plastic bag scene would only have been half as memorable without the sense of sadness that the music helped to instill in it.The acting is first rate throughout; I don't think Kevin Spacey has ever put a foot wrong, so his fine performance is no surprise, but all the other actors in the film, particularly the younger cast members (who give courageous and utterly convincing portrayals of mixed up youth in an equally confused suburbia) are equally excellent.The message of beauty amongst ugliness is the driving force of the film, and it's an interesting one. Whether or not you subscribe to the theory that a plastic bag flapping in the wind is the most beautiful thing you'll ever see is down to your own personal judgment. This film, however, with its strangely optimistic message that you can always find beauty and happiness if you stand back from your ingrained perspectives and look for it, should move even those who don't see the appeal of such projectile polythene.",9,0,0,15 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," The most important film I've ever seen.
","This film made me consider the sheer brutality and terror of warfare in a way I had never done before. It did this by placing me in the middle of the battle while at the same time enjoying the comfort of a cinema seat. I realised in a way I had never accepted before the horror of the D-Day landings, and the courage of each and every man who didn't just lie down and play dead as soon as they (and if they) set foot on the beach, which is probably what I would have done.It made me think in a way that no other film has done. I cam,e away reminded of the sacrifice that was made so that we can live in freedom today. It reminded everyone that WWII wasn't the neat and tidy war that it sort of gets remembered as. I was moved to tears, and I'm not even an American (the Brits landed too, by the way).
But that small issue aside, this film made me think more than any other film has ever done; not just a war film, but any film. It is, to me, the most important movie ever made.",10,0,0,5 August 1999
Toy Story 2," They've done it again.
","Yesterday I attended an advanced screening for this film in London's West End; it was screened in a large theatre full of students, not kids, because the company running the preview were testing out the film on our age bracket particularly (ie people in their 20s). An recipe for disaster? A case of a theatre full of people watching the wrong film? The hell it was...Each and every person in the theatre loved it. Being a Brit who's lived abroad, I'm used to the idea of people cheering and clapping at the parts they particularly enjoy... but only in America. This film was enough to provoke such a response from even us non-emotive Brits however, and on a great many occasions. We laughed loud, broke into cheers regularly, and actually applauded at least five times. I was too busy enjoying the film to keep count.Why? Well, the humour in it is NOT exclusively aimed at for kids; that's not to say they won't find it funny, but I defy an parent to watch it without at some point saying 'my kid's not going to get that', or even, in the case of a couple of surprisingly risque gags, 'I HOPE my kid's not going to get that'...Also, it was basically an action film. After a comfortable few opening scenes which establish that all is well, it doesn't take long for things to go a bit awry, and then more so, and soon there are toys all over the city and the tension becomes genuine. The laughs keep on coming however, and there is (with the exception of a single concession to the notorious Disney Song) not a single unentertaining moment to be found.There's a different take on the Toy idea (what if you're outgrown?) and almost any possible inclusion you could wish for as far as references to the first film, or others, or scenarios that are dying to be explored (like a now wisened Buzz meeting another Buzz who still thinks he's a toy). And then there's all the new characters (the implied arrival of a Mrs Potato head at the end of the first movie is gloriously realised, for example) are as amusing as all the old favourites, who all enjoy large roles in the limelight.It's also comforting to see that they've kept to the overall look of the original. You can't help but think that they could draw people a lot more realistically if they wanted to, but they don't; because then it wouldn't feel like the same world. This is an excellent example of how Pixar treat their movies with a lot more importance than they attach to their (also spectacular) visuals.If you loved the first film, go and see this one. There is nothing they could have done that they have not, and nothing they shouldn't have done that they have. Once again Pixar have remembered the most important thing about filmmaking; all the computer visuals are very well and good, but if there's no substance to the movie you're wasting your time. This is clearly a movie that was sat down and thought about, and the results are breathtaking.",10,0,1,2 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The worst of all four movies so far, but still OK. I'll tell you why.
","One spoiler for The Phantom Menace here, folks; same one as on the back of the soundtrack, but less precise.First, I love Star Wars and I think the Empire Strikes Back is a good film. It just absolutely isn't the best. Let me tell you why.Everyone I speak to on this subject (and I try not to do it too often) invariably plays the 'dark' card in the discussion. It's the best one because it's so daaaaark, man.Leave dark for the Blade Runners and the Aliens; it's so much more at home with them. Granted, I think it's particularly effective when a previously untouchable character like Han Solo winds up getting tortured and you hear his screams. That bit is good. BUT... It's Star Wars. Darkness is all well and good but it's undone when you know there's another film coming along in which in the opening forty minutes -Han will be unfrozen -Jabba/Boba will be killed -Lando will be a fully fledged friend again.Empire is a very elaborate set up for a scenario which is undone, as we all know it will be, in the opening scene of the next movie. And when you think about it, it's not really all that dark anyway. Empire is the only one of the four films currently made, which doesn't have a major character die in it. Think about that one. And at the end, Luke's recovered and they're basically ready to kick some Empirical butt. It's faintly optimistic. Dark? Ridley Scott need not feel threatened.So there you go. This movie is good. Very entertaining (even if some of the Yoda bits put me to sleep). But at the end of the day. I think it's atmosphere sticks out like a sore thumb. I hope the 'darkness' in store for Episode III is handled with a bit more maturity, and laced with a bit more authenticity.",7,0,4,26 July 1999
