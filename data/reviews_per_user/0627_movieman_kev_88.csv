The Avengers," Best summer movie of 2012
","Not much to say about this one that hasn't been said millions of times before. Brilliant comic-based movie that is, for me personally, the second best Marvel movie ever made, right behind Howard the Duck (kidding, kidding the first Iron Man film obviously). Joss Whedon further proves, as if any more evidence was needed, that as a writer/director he's amongst the top of his field. This is also the best Hulk film ever made and makes it more of a shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films. Bruce Banner is the stand out, but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments, save for Hawkever whom is woefully underused and I hope his role is a tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut.But really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between. Loved this film.",9,21,42,2 July 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," very nice
","I waited till this came to cable simply because I wasn't going to pay 15 dollars to see one movie which we split in half out of typical Weinstein greed. Plus it afforded me the luxury of seeing both films back to back. Whereas the first half was all glitz and lightning fast action set pieces, which was a fun ride. This half is more typically Tarantino in relation to the dialog that seems to crackle and ooze coolness. Not to say there isn't any action, as there are a few great stand-out set pieces to be had, just not as manic as the first half. This is leisurely and takes it's time and for true fans, it's all the better for it. David Carradine is great as Bill, Uma gets her most-rounded performance in her career, and while the movie, as a whole, isn't as sheerly fun as Pulp Fiction, nor as perfect as the sadly under-rated Jackie Brown, it still makes for a hell of a ride. One thing that tee'd me off was the credits 'based on a story by Q&U', which just struck me as overly pretentious of them. But that's obviously just my opinion.Signing off,K",8,2,4,15 September 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," for the most part hilarious, if extremely base
","Sacha Baron Cohen finally sees the success that he certainly didn't attain with his previous 'Ali G Indahouse'. Now when I use the term success, I mean in the world-wide term, as I'm quite aware he's been well known over the pond for awhile now and has enjoyed cult status in the States for a bit. However with the release of this film, he's a bonafide star overnight (well his alter-ego Borat is anyway) & with good reason as this mockumentary about a naive ridiculously bigoted, offensive foreign documentarian, Borat, touring America in hopes of wedding Pamala Anderson, of Baywatch fame, is utterly hilarious. Every time he interacts with everyday people it caused me to laugh and brought a smile to my face. The only thing that detracted from the experience of watching the film is that at one point it turned into very nervous laughter and I had to look away from the screen. (yeah,yeah, call me a prude. But if you went to see this film in theaters with other members of your family, you'd be just as embarrassed). Other than that, the film was the most i laughed in while watching a movie in quite some time. True the movie is pretty basic and not subtle in the least, true it doesn't paint Americans in the best of lights. But I found it a pretty damn good film, none the less My Grade: A-",8,3,9,19 March 2007
Gremlins," Come on, we're talking cable
","Randall Peltzer (the late Hoyt Axton), while going all around town trying to sell his faulty wacky inventions, accidentally stumbles on a cute little Mogwai at an antique china store. The owner refuse to sell it, but the kid sees dollar signs and sells it to Mr. Peltzer, telling him three things never to do to the creature. So back in Kingston Falls, the misguided inventor presents it to his son, Billy (Zach Galligan) telling him the warning that the Chinese boy imparted to him. Needless to say, Billy ignores all three rules and soon evil little Gremlins are all over town causing rampant destruction.This movie is greatness in every single way. With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from the glorious '80's (Man that decade was GREAT to be a kid or teenager in).Never overtly slapstick comical, this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less and seeing the amazingly great Dick Miller is ALWAYS a treat. By the by, call me dense but I never realized that Howie Mandell did the voice for Gizmo. That's kinda neat. This was followed by a sequel that's just about every bit as good as the original.My Grade: A Special Edition DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Joe Dante, Producer Mike Finnell and Gremlins Creator Chris Walas, Second Commentary by Dante and Actors Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller and Howie Mandel; Cast & Crews bios; 8 Additional Scenes (with Optional Commentary; Photo Gallery; short vintage featurette; Theatrical & Re-issue Trailer; and Trailer for 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch'",8,34,44,15 October 2005
Lucky Number Slevin," too much hipster dialog
","In this movie that tries so hard to be 'cleverer than thou', Josh Hartnett as Slevin leads a cast of actors who all speak in pretty much the same voice. That voice, of course, being the faux-hip Tarantino-light, 'hipster wit' that writer Jason Smilovic unwisely chooses to imbue them with. As the disappointing, yet not unforeseen, outcome of that is one is always keenly aware that one's watching a movie. In that I mean that because the writer is too busy trying to be hip and clever, tat I never was drawn into the film whatsoever and even found it to be a tad on the annoying side. Perhaps I'm being too tough on the film as the tale of mistaken identity, mob hits, and the twists and turns therein is serviceable enough, if on the highly derivative side. and Bruce Willis is, as always, highly watchable. But as a whole the film fizzles out in a sea of pomposity.My Grade: D+ Eye Candy: Jennifer Miller bares her breasts..or does she? hmmmDVD Extras: Audio commentary by director Paul McGuigan; Second commentary with actor Josh Hartnett, actress Lucy Liu, and writer Jason Smilovi; 13 minute making-of featurette; deleted scenes; Alternate ending; Theatrical trailer; and Trailers for 'Kill shot', 'The Protector', 'Pulse', 'Clerks 2', and 'Scary Movie 4'",4,18,37,29 September 2006
50 First Dates," it's no Wedding Singer
","Adam Sandler plays yet another naive 'witty' eccentric character. In this one he falls for Drew Barrymore who after a car crash due to her seemingly incestuous father can only remember one day at a time, and forgets it when she goes to sleep leading to wild madcap hilarity.. OK OK, this more is neither of those three things, but it sounded good. I really wanted to like this film, as the previous pairing of Sandler and Barrymore, The Wedding Singer, was a great comedy. Alas, while this has a few laughs, it just wasn't nearly as good. Like Drew's character you will forget that you watched the film before long.My Grade: C Where I saw it: HBO on demand",Null,2,4,10 January 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," quench your Jones for excitement
","Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has to find the Ark of the Convenant for the US government, but it will be far from easy as he'll have to deal with his old nemesis, Rene Belloq, Nazi's who want the Ark for themselves, and snakes. It's a toss up on what he detests more. This was the film that spawned one of the best trilogies EVER. Most fall apart by the third movie (:Godfather, Back to the Future, Star Wars ALL have weak links), not so here, ALL the Indiana Jones films are pure gold. And bring back very fond childhood memories. THIS is a action-packed blockbuster like it should be done. Thrilling, exciting, humorous, and insanely great escapism. Accept no substitutes, because Indiana Jones is one of a kind.My Grade: A+ DVD-Rom content: an exclusive web link to get picture galleries, a PC game demo, and Raiders Animatic: Opening the Ark",9,0,1,25 August 2005
Deja Vu," Goes a little towards redeeming Tony Scott for Domino
","Doug Carlin (Washington) is an ATF agent who's trying to find out who blew up a ferry as well as the death of a girl name Claire who's somehow linked, gets a chance to alter history when he stumbles on a group of scientists and their new invention that lets one look four days into the past. Well-acted and thrilling enough this is most akin to 'Donnie Darko' in feel if not in tone. To clarify that further, both movies appear smarter than they are in actuality. Whereas 'Twelve Monkeys' has been the only reasonably honest time travel movie (honest as in as much as a science fiction dues ex machina as time travel can be), this film has to be looked at for what it is, merely a popcorn flick for the masses, happy contrived ending and all. That's not a slight against the film, even if my personal tastes don't lean that way for the most part (I can however , unlike some cinema snobs, enjoy one from time to time) The crux of the matter, for fear of me rambling on, is that this film is typical. Not good, nor bad, strictly middle of the road popcorn action flick. Albeit one with a tad more visual sheen on it due in no small part to the director, Scott.My Grade: C+",6,0,1,10 May 2007
Minority Report," Blade Runner this is NOT
","Tom Cruise as Chief John Anderton of the future's pre-cog division, wherein criminals are caught before they do the crime, has to go on the lam after he sees his future self committing murder. This being a Spielberg film, you can count on three things. The film itself will look great aesthetically (and with all the money he gets thrown his way, it damn well better look great). Two, the film will be dumbed down sufficiently as to appeal to the masses, or rather, what Hollywood thinks the average intellect of the average movie-goer to be. And three, It'll go on for too long. This adheres to all the aforementioned characteristics of a Spielberg production. The dumbing down aspect being the saddest as I love Philap K. Dick's work. All in all another disappointment from a man who hasn't given us greatness since 1998's 'Saving Pvt. Ryan'. That being said, it's still a damn sight better than the awful 'AI'.If it seems that I harder on this director than most, it's only because I expect so much more from him.My Grade:C- 2-disc DVD Extras: Disk 2) From Story to Screen; Deconstructing Minority Report; Stunts of; ILM; Interviews with Spielberg and Cruise; Concepts; Storyboards; Cast and filmmaker bios; production notes; 3 theatrical Trailers; and game trailer",5,1,6,17 March 2005
Se7en," Seven is a Ten
","This is the film that single-handedly made me think of David Fincher as a great director, all of his subsequent films only cemented the deal of him being one of my favorites. Brad Piit & Morgan Freeman as Detectives Mills and Sommerset are after a devious, grisly killer who murders his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins (Sloth, Greed, Envy, etcetera, etc..), in this extremely well crafted, gripping, suspenseful thriller, that never falls into the one tap that these thrillers too often fall into, which is letting the audience get ahead of the plot. ALL of the actors in this film are superb in their respective parts, including Kevin Spacey who gives his best performance of his career, just slightly edging out his part in 'The Usual Suspects' in my mind. It also features one of the greatest endings that I've ever witnessed. Moreso, the entire film has a kind of poetic beauty and sense of grace that comes off it that is simply mesmerizing and makes this film one that is simply a sheer joy to come back to again and again. A must see modern day classic, no matter how you slice it, this movie comes with my highest recommendations.My Grade: A+2-Disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by Director David Fincher, Actor Brad Pitt and Actor Morgan Freeman; Second Commentary by Professor of Film Studies/Author Richard Dyer, Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, Editor Richard Francis-Bruce, New Line President of Production Michael De Luca and David Fincher; Third Commentary by Director of Photography Darius Khondji, Production Designer Arthur Max, Editor Richard Francis-Bruce, Richard Dyer and David Fincher; Fourth Commentary by Sound Designer Ren Klyce, Composer Howard Shore (with Isolated 5.1 Music and FX Cues), Richard Dyer and David Fincher) Disc 2) Exploration of the Opening Title Sequence with 3 Angle Options & 6 Audio Options; 7 Deleted Scenes, Extended Takes, and 2 alternate endings with Optional Commentary by David Fincher; Production Designs with Commentary by the Photographers; Still Photographs; The Notebooks with Commentary by the Designers; Filmographies; Mastering for the Home Theater with optional commentary; Theatrical Electronic press kit; and Theatrical Trailer:DVD-ROM content: Scrpt to screen comparison; and Weblinks",10,1,3,24 September 2005
Wayne's World," The Decline of Western Civilization Part 2.5: The Party On Years
","Wayne and Gath (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey respectively) make the jump from Saturerday Night Live recurring skit to do my third favorite SNL-based film (the two ahead of it are 'Office Space' and 'the Blues Brothers). In this hilarious film, Wayne and Garth are doing their lowly public access show, when they're discovered by Ben Kane (Rob Lowe of 'the Outsiders' and 'St. Elmos Fire), who proceeds to get them to sign a contract to take there small show and produce a national version of it. Wayne uses the deal to get his new love interest, Cassandra Wong (Tia Carrere, who now seemed to fall into oblivion. This is a warning to all aspiring actresses to NEVER say no to nude scenes or fall by the wayside) and her band to play on his show. But Ben isn't as benevolent as he first seems to be. With non-stop humor, as well as great memorable cameos by Ed O'Neill, Meatloaf, Chris Farley, and the amazingly great Alice Cooper, what's NOT to love?? Plus ANY time Brian Doyle-Murray gets to be in a film is greatness. Oh and be sure to stay through the credits.My Grade: A DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Penelope Spheeris; 23 minutes,15 seconds of cast and crew interviews; Clips from 'the Brady Bunch', 'Solid Gold Workout' & 1979's 'Sundown';and Theatrical TrailerDVD Gripes: Led Zeppelin suck ass for screwing up a part of this classic movie, they can shove 'Stairway to Heaven' up you know what.

Akira," Anime 101
","31 years after World War 3, two friends in a violent bike gang find themselves on two sides, albeit unwillingly, of opposing viewpoints in this epic anime of government conspiracy and genetic tampering. It's a rich, complex story if one chooses to watch it with an open mind. And while not without it's fair share of flaws, it's an extremely rewarding experience and ranks among the very best that you'll likely find in the Anime genre. It's extremely fast-paced, viciously violent, very bloody, and has a interesting message to boot. What's not to like? My Grade: A2-disc special edition DVD Extras: Disc 1) English translation of graffiti option (which is cool and all, but not really needed) Disc 2) A 48 minute Making of; Akira sound clip; Interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo; Interviews with restoration staff; Stills gallery; and Teaser & Theatrical trailers",9,5,10,27 October 2005
Underworld," I wish I could Lycan this to a good film
","Amidst a generations old war between vampires and were-wolfs, Selene (Kate Bekensale, 'Haunted', 'Uncovered'), a sexy vamp, finds herself inexplicably romantically drawn to lycanthrope, Michael, whom she saves despite facing the ire of her own kind, and whom might just have the key to finally eat this decades long feud.An exercise in style over substance, this overly long, overtly (almost to the point of clownishly) melodramatic piece of fantasy action assembly-line product looks good but all is for naught as it lacks any kind of heart (or indeed brain). I truly tried to watch this flick with an open mind and choose to give it the benefit of the doubt. My friend loves this franchise, alas I had to come to the uncomforting conclusion that his taste in films is quite suspect to say the least. My Grade: D+",4,5,9,14 June 2012

","John and Russell (Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, respectively) join the Army after John, dissatisfied which how his life is going, talks Russell into it. They have to survive boot camp, as well as , along with their love interests and Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), save the rest of their Platoon when they're trapped behind enemy lines. This is the best comedy revolving around the Army ever and has so very many memorable scenes and quotable lines that it's unreal. All the actors are great in the parts (including a superb Warren Oates, hilarious Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy & John Larroquette) The Extended edition, unlike SOME so-called 'special editions' actually adds substance to an already classic film. It's almost impossible for any red-blooded American male NOT to love this film.My Grade: A DVD Extras: Both the 106 minute Theatrical cut & 122 minute Extended edition; Commentary by director Ivan Reitman and co-writer/producer Dan Goldberg: 'Stars and Stripes' 2-part documentary; 6 deleted scenes Theatrical Trailer; a complication trailer for '80's hits'; and Trailers for 'D.E.B.S.' and 'Hitch' Eye Candy: Roberta Leighton, and Sue Bowser get topless; numerous woman are topless as well as full frontal in the shower; numerous topless girls in the bar with the mud wrestling; in the Extended edition P.J.

Hostel," much like 'Cabin Fever' in that it's a bit over-hyped
","Wow, a lot of people seem to either really dig this film or hate it with a passion. I, as a true horror fan, can relate quite a tad more with the latter. I could easily see and emphasize with the major problems that horror aficionados have with this film. It IS unoriginal and rips off so many better films. It IS an exercise of (mtv) style over substance. And it is pretty unrealistic and hokey. However that being said, I still can't bring myself to out and out loathe this picture as it does have bits and pieces to redeem it somewhat, even if said pieces were smaller than the great Takashi Miike's two lines in the film. And trust me if you were among the people that recognized his cameo at first sight than you KNOW this movie wasn't nearly as graphic or 'disturbing' as way too many people seem to tout it as being. Also, as an aside, the children were a major downfall of the film as much as to be laughable. But I did enjoy the movie somewhat if only because of the enjoyment of the people I watched it with, one of which brought the movie over so I didn't have to pay a dime to see it. Plus the nudity was quality.My Grade: C- (right on the border of a D+ though)",4,4,7,23 April 2006
Happy Gilmore," travel back to a time when Adam Sandler was something that seems unimaginable nowadays...funny
","Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, a constantly rejecter hockey player wannabe. Due to way overly late unpaid taxes, his mom will lose the house that Happy grew up in. Gilmore has no clue how to raise the money, so he puts his grand mom in a nursing home overseen by a cruel orderly (an uncredited Ben Stiller). Later, back at his grandmothers house, he tries to get the movers to get back to work by out distancing them in golf strokes. When he finds out that he has an amazing golf swing and can get money for it he heads to the putting range to have people pay to watch him. This is where he first catches the eye of Chubbs Peterson (a hilarious Carl Weathers), who wants to enter Happy in some pro tournaments. Happy is hesitant at first, but his need for money wins over. However he has quite a temper, which leads to the pro golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) to loathe him. But Gilmore has Julie Bowen as a love interest who tries to keep him cool. This is a hilarious Sandler vehicle from way back when he was still funny. It has a great many lines that you'll find yourself quoting with friends months afterwords, non-stop hilarity, and a very memorable fight with Bob Barker. What more can one ask for?

The Girl Next Door," From the Writers of 'Van Wilder' & the Director of 'the Animal' comes a movie that surprisingly didn't suck TOTAL ass
","Matthew (Emile Hirsch) is a nerdy nobody who can't think of anything he'll fondly remember from high school after he graduates. That is until former porn star, Danielle ('24''s Elisha Cuthbert) shows up as the new girl next door.Things get complicated (as these films are prone to do) when her former porn manager comes calling to get her back. This adolescent male fantasy suffers from way too much music on the soundtrack (nearly every scene of the film is scored with a late '80's or early '90's tune with the purpose to substitute for any true emotional feeling), a insincere undeserved sentimentality that permeates through the film, and a surprising lack of laughs. While the acting is fair enough and the film is watchable, it still lacks any memorability and will be forgotten after a while. Still, it remains a step up for the Director and writers, if a step down for much of the cast.My Grade: C-",5,1,4,17 October 2005
Spider-Man 2," caught in the web
","It's been almost two years since Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) became Spiderman and he can't seem to to hold a job, his college grades are falling, and his even him tenacious friendship with Mary Jane is eroding. What's a costumed web-slinging wall crawler to do? Why, through in the proverbial towel, of course. Peter gets fed up at the constant hassles of him life and decides Spiderman no more. But when Dr. Otto Octavius suffers a freak accident that fuses the mechanical tentacles that he invented to his body and destroyed the inhabiter chip that kept him as the one in charge, changing him into a super-villain whom the Daily Bugle deems Doctor Otopus, the only one that can stop his rampage is Spiderman, but does Parker have the hero spirit still in him? This film had me feeling divisive. On one hand, Alfred Molina's performance as Dr. Octavious and later Doc Ock is phenomenal, and I have very happy that the campy tendencies of Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin in the first one were nowhere to be found in Molina's portrayal, the action was suitably thrilling (maybe more so than the first), and Bruce Campbell's role of 'snooty usher' warmed the cockles of my heart. On the other hand, Kirsten Dunst STILL doesn't jibe for me as Mary Jane Watson, even less so in this sequel as she looks sickly hideous, AND annoying. And more people saw Spiderman unmasked than was really feasibly acceptable. But all in all, I did enjoy this film way more than I have gripes about it and I think it was infinitely better than the huge let-down of X-men 2.My Grade: B+2-Disc Collecter's Edition DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by director Sam Raimi, producer Avi Arad, co-producer Grant Curtis and star Tobey Maguire; Second Commentary by Special FX supervisor John Dykstra and his effects team; subtitle trivia track; 4 web episodes; 'Ordinary' music video by Train; Blooper reel; Theatrical trailer; Trailers for 'Hitch', 'Spider-man', 'Christmas with the Cranks', 'Spanglish', 'Seinfeld on DVD', 'the Forgotten', 'White Chicks', and 'Hellboy' Disc 2) 12-part 'Making the Amazing' documentary; 3 featurettes (Hero in Crisis,Eight Arms to Hold You, and The Women of Spider-Man); multi-angle 'Pier Sequence' deconstruction; artwork gallery; 'Spider-Man 2' video game preview3 Easter Eggs: Disc 1) In the Commentaries menu, there's a hidden spider icon, find it for an introduction by Sam Raimi made for a preview audience in Japan Disc 2) go to the Making the Amazing menu and highlight one of Doc Ock's tentacles for a special guest wearing Doc Ock's suit; Go to the Gallery menu and highlight the invisible Spidey Sences over Spidey's head for Doc Ock singing 'If I were a Rich Man' from 'Fiddler on the Roof'",8,0,2,6 September 2005

They're not only chased by the military but by Zorg (Gary Olman) who has linked himself with Evil and plans to get 4 stones that Leeloo needs to save the universe, but for less altruistic reasons then her. What follows is a great action packed movie. Chris Tucker as DJ Ruby Rhod is pretty annoying at times, but it isn't as much so as to aversely affect my accolades for the film. All the primary actors are great, the action set pieces are a blast and the computer generated scenery is much more appealing then the one's found in Star Wars: Episodes 1 and 2.

Hot Fuzz," does for action films what Shaun did for the zombie sub-genre
","Sergeant Angel (Simon Pegg) is good at his job, TOO good. So feeling that the other police officers are looking bad in comparison, he's transfered to a quiet little 'crime free' town where thing are not what they appear to be. Nick Frost is Danny his new partner in this homage to the action film genre from the genius that brought us Shaun of the dead and Spaced. Just as having a good knowledge of the zombie horror genre, increased how much one appreciated the great 'Shaun of the Dead', as is true with a good knowledge of action movies to 'Hot Fuzz'. That's not to say that you'll get no enjoyment from either one if yo're not a serious fan of the respective genres, (both a great stand alone movies as well) just that if you are, the nuances shine forth and you can enjoy the homages to maximum extent. Filled with subtle and not so subtle jokes, I found the whole thing very humorous. Never hysterically funny, but smart and humorous. I found myself smiling the whole duration of the film. There's a bit of gore, so not one for the kids. Yet if you enjoyed any of the previous things from the collaboration of Wright and Pegg, you'll fancy this one as well. Action lovers will get a kick out of it too.My Grade: A-",8,4,7,8 May 2007

It's up to Rick O'Connell (Brandon Fraiser) to save the day. tend to judge movies in the genre in which there are (ie. I wouldn't judge a comedy the same as I'd judge a drama or an independent) That being said as fair as giant bombastic brainless summer action extravaganzas go, this one isn't half bad. Bredon Fraiser will NEVER be an action star, but his acting in this is serviceable enough. I can't help but feel that the movie would have been bettered if Stephen Sommers had nothing to do with it, yet compare to his work with 'Van Helsing' and 'the Scorpian King' will attest to, this IS the better movie.

Constantine," why bother??
","John Constantine (a supremely lackluster Keanu Reeves), is caught between a war with Heaven and Hell after the Spear of Destiny is found. Spear of Destiny and no Nazis to be found? Blashemy! How can a film be convoluted and dumbed down at the same time? But this film succeeds at just that. . If you read the comic 'Hellblazer', DON'T go see this movie. It strips the character of John Constantine of pretty much everything that was cool about him in the first place and anyone would have made a better choice to play him than Keanu Reeves. That said, if you're a fan of Keanu (which I'm not) you'll fine this to be passable. For me it was more like 'The Prophecy' than anything else. And the last scene is yet another proverbial gut-punch to any of the fans of the comic who actually sat through the whole thing.My Grade: D+",4,6,15,5 March 2005

Sure the film is syrupy and conforms to certain Hollywood stereotypes, but it's still an all-around great film..In my mind, this is Redford's shining moment, his best film and quite possibly the best 'baseball' film out there. (the baseball is in quotations because the movie isn't really about the sport) I'm not even going to quibble and say that Roy is kinda dense for not knowing what Glenn Close's character had to tell him WAY in advance.

Just Go with It," Just don't go on with making crappy films Mr. Sandler
","A generic, formulaic, latter day Sandler with all the bad connotations all that entail. This one might be ever so slightly better as I laughed a total of 2 times, something I haven't done while watching a mainstream Sandler film for a decade or so, but even of those one was unintentional. What you see is what you get, no surprises, I can admit its a damn sight better than complete trash such as Little Nicky, Zohan, Mr, Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill combined, but still not really recommended for more than background noise as you do something else and certainly nowhere near as good as the wedding singer, happy gillmore or billy Madison.",3,3,6,29 August 2012
X-Men," The Usual Suspects are Apt Pupils indeed
","Rouge and Wolverine, two mutants with extraordinary powers (Rouge can sap people's energy by more touch, while Wolverine has an exoskeleton made of an unbreakable alloy, retractable claws, and an accelerated healing factor).join Charles Xavier's school for gifted young students and become the newest members of a team of other mutants, called the X-men and together they fight Magneto, a Jewish mutant who hates humanity after growing up in Nazi-era Germany, and his brotherhood of Evil mutants. All the while trying to dissuade a public from hating all of them. This was one of the first superhero films that opted for a more serious tone as opposed to the campy ones that preceded it, and for the most part works, True there were a few things I would have changed (Glenn Danzig would've made a more kick ass Wolverine, I never warmed up to Halle Barry as Storm), but all the other actors are very good (particularly, Ian McKellen as a spot-on Magneto).

The Prestige," one of the best of 2006
","Christopher Nolen further proves that he's definitely a writer/director to look out for with this excellent tale of feuding magicians. Without naming any actors specifically, they're all uniformly great in this film. I was captivated from beginning to end and that in itself is pretty impressive and no mean feat. The fact that none of the actors were even nominated for this years Oscars is a mild travesty as it's definitely one of the best acted films I'd seen in 2006. And yes the ending can be seen coming a whiles away if one's paying even the mildest of attention, but that doesn't really detract from the experience one iota. It's definitely not a feel good movie to say the least, but it's simply superb.My Grade: A",9,3,5,3 March 2007
Silent Hill," quick name a great movie based on video game
","If you're stumped, don't worry it was a trick question. The answer is there are none. Sadly that trend doesn't stop with this wretched excuse for a game. First of all, if you haven't even played the games, don't go see this film. The two mediums are strongly interwoven (more so than any other previous film of this kind that I saw before) and you WILL be lost. Fortunately I have played said games, so that wasn't an issue for me. But the excruciating dialog, the lame acting, the lulls in the film (at more than 2 hours, you'll be glancing at your watch countless times), and the waste of the one talented actor of the bunch, Sean Bean, were a big issue for me. The excellent 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' this is definitely not. My friend Dave, who drug me to this piece of excrement, however loved the film. But to put that in perspective, he also loved both Underworld movies, Daredevil, the Hulk, Ready to Rumble, and Van Helsing (to name but a few) So needless to say, his kudos are suspect to say the least.",2,0,10,29 April 2006
Scary Movie 2," Rushed and awful

Cindy, Ray, Shoty & Brenda are back this time they all find themselves being tricked into going to a haunted mansion.Where as the first film was actually watchable and pretty funny, this one is neither. And at less then an hour and a half, it's still of battle of willpower to sit through. Tottally rancid on just about every level, waisting the combined talents of the usually reliable David Cross, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Andy Richter, and James Woods (the last is the only slightly amusing aspect of this waste of film).

But Death, like in the original, is a bitch and comes for them one by one. Kim also makes a visit to Clear Rivers (Ali Larter from the original).

He is constantly ridiculed by the monks, the only one to show compassion towards him being the beautiful Sister Encarnacion whom he has a secret crush on. The movie chooses the low-brow path which while not in itself a bad thing when done with originality and/ or flair. Sadly this film has neither and simply repeats the same two 'gags' over and over again with no style.

Lost in Translation," Wow!!
","My friend & I had to go out of our way to see this film, as it wasn't playing near us. We got a tad lost, so we ended up missing the first 5 minutes. But that doesn't matter, This movie was so amazingly good. Bill Murray is Bob, a depressed actor in Tokyo shooting Whiskey ads when he finds a kindred soul in Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson), a depressed girl there with her photographer husband. All the acting in this film was amazing. Not haven seen the director's previous 'The Virgin Suicides', i had no idea what to expect. Needless to say i was VERY happy.

","Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively) are two newish bike cops whom are tasked by the '21 Jump Street' program with infiltrating a high school disguised as students and bust a new drug ring, in this comedy based on Stephen J. Cannell's hit late 1980's Fox cop show.Well this exceeded expectations, granted truth be told expectations were a tad bit low when I learned of a comedic rendition of a decidedly non-comedic TV show. However surprisingly the film is a great mix of low-brow, high-concept and self-referential humor that made it a joy to watch. With past Cannell shows hitting the big screen with A-Team and now 21 Jump Street, one can only hope that 'The Greatest American Hero' would get the treatment next. Now THAT would be epic.

Top Secret!," watchable but overrated
","This Zucker/Abrams/Zucker film that parodies WW2 and Elvis films, has Val Kilmer as Nick Rivers, a rock and roll singer who founds himself drawn into the French Resistance while performing a concert in East Germany. Chaulk this up to yet another watchable but overrated Kilmer film akin to 'the Doors', 'Real Genius', or 'Pollock' as opposed to the handful of REAL good movies he's done. The problem is while the jokes are as rapid-fire and humorous as any other ZAZ spoof, the characters don't have the likabilty that they show in 'Airplane' or the first Naked Gun film. In the commentary track they almost seem apologetic, well I wouldn't go as far as thinking that they should apologize for this film (Scary Movie 3 however they SHOULD be sorry for) My Grade: CDVD Extras: Commentary by Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker & Jerry Zucker, Producers Jon Davison & Hunt Lowry and Moderator Fred Rubin:; 4 Alternate Scenes; 3 Storyboard sequences; Theatrical Trailer Easter Egg: In the Storyboards menu highlight the magnifying glass for the Bookstore scene unreversed.",6,1,6,20 October 2005

Sure along the way they find some skinned human bodies, but they got the job done, right? WRONG! It turns out that a bigger Predator has turned these elite military men into prey, picking them off one by one. The remaining men and one woman have to learn how to not only survive, but triumph against this dangerous and very deadly heavily camouflaged alien warrior Are they up for the task?The acting will never win any academy awards, but this film is an action fans wet dream. With a wonderful degree of sheer macho power that is seldom,if ever, seen in movies of today, this movie becomes a true MAN'S movie and is further proof (as if more evidence was needed), that the '80's was simply such a kick ass decade. It's such a joy to watch Arnold, and Carl Weathers do what they do best, which is kick ass. Very cool special effects and convincing gore (for the most part) as well.

28 Weeks Later," a fairly solid sequel
","28 weeks after the original outbreak of the Rage virus the military is still busy cleaning up and providing 'safe zones' for the survivors of the post-apocalyptic London. However two kids who want to see their old house could just be everyone's undoing in this sequel to the film '28 Days Later' Director Juan Fresnadilo might not be quite up at the level as Danny Boyle, but he still does an admirable job in his own right and the film crawls with tension (espiecally the opening sequence which is superb). It's also well-acted apart from a few bit parts. But make no bones about it, it's the great Robert Carlyle (Full Monty) who steals the show as the children's' dad who makes some extremely tough choices, he really sinks his teeth into the role and the film is all the more better for it.If the franchise can keep up the same breakneck pace, tension, and scares as the first two films have then i'd have no qualms about seeing a '28 Months Later' or even a '28 Years Later' My Grade: B+ Eye Candy: Catherine McCormack shows T&A (but due to the scenario it isn't arousing)",7,12,21,16 November 2007

Harry brings his rag-tag team of oil drillers along for the voyage and they have just a handful of days to train to become astronauts (because training astronauts to become drillers would have been to ridiculous, I guess). There's a sub-plot involving Ben Affleck being in love with Harry's daughter, but it's groan-inducing (the 'animal crackers' scene being one of the most horrid ones involving Mr. Affleck ever). But face it the star of the film is the asteroid itself, as it's a blockbuster. Shut your brain off, munch the popcorn and ooh and ahh at the special effects if you must.

The Village," Out of time
","The film 'The Village' centers on well a commune really and all the people that live on said Commune as if cut off from the outside world. To say more then that would be to spoil it to much, and I wouldn't dare do that, would I? This was my second least favorite of M. Knight's movies. (It's still light years better than 'Wide Awake) The acting was good enough and I liked the actress playing the blind redhead. But the film as a whole did nothing for me and left me feeling empty. It's not a good movie, nor a bad movie, but for a director of his talent it is a rather boring movie. But I do give Shyamalan credit for doing something that I never imagined I'd do, which was sitting through an entire film with that snot-nosed idiot Adrian Brody. And to think that I'll have to see that A-hole again when Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong comes out fills me with absolute dread. Also the Village is NOT an allegory about the current political climate of the United States, however thought up that bull is way too addle-minded for the human race.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Deconstructing the Village; Deleted scenes; Bryce's Diary; M knight's home movies; Photo gallery;Trailers for 'the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gallaxy', 'Ladder 49', 'Mr. 3000', and 'National Treasure'",5,6,11,23 February 2005
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Walk Hard limps in the second half
","John C. Reilly stars as Dewey Cox in a spoof on music biopics. The film starts off well enough, but as the movie drones on, the jokes quickly become redundant to the point of being downright tedious towards the last half of the movie (IE. anything after the 'beatles' segment is progressively worse). Reilly is pretty damn good as musical wunderkind, Cox, but sadly he can't compensate for the lackluster script. This isn't Apatow's worst written film (see Celtic Pride or Fun with Dick & Jane for examples of those), but it's still a step down from his more accomplished funnier ones (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin) Walk Hard limps especially in the extended cut. Although most of the songs are quite catchy.My Grade:C",5,3,5,23 April 2008

","Christian Bale stars as Trevor Reznik. an insomniac whom hasn't slept for a year . His sanity begins to deteriorate and his paranoia begins to rise after a work related injury befalls one of his co-workers. I rented this one when my lady friend wanted to get one and she told me this or 'Diary of a Mad Black Woman' (which I couldn't help but laugh at the suggestion, which got her slightly mad, but I digress). Needless to say, I picked this one. I really got into it, not for the 'mystery', as any seasoned viewer worth his salt will figure out everything rather quickly (the first time I saw the Hangman game it was plainly obvious), but rather Christian Bale's performance which is mesmerizing. He's on a fast-track to becoming one of my favorite actors of my generation. The fact that he put himself through all this just for one independent film is amazing. Furthermore, this movie almost makes me forgive Scott Kosar for all his silly little wrong-minded remakes....ALMOST.My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Commentary by Brad Anderson; 25 minute Making of featurette; 8 Deleted/Alternate scenes (2 with optional commentary); Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for 'Mean Creek', 'Enduring Love', 'Suspect Zero', & 'Schultze gets the Blues' Eye Candy: Jennifer Jason Leigh gets topless",7,2,4,8 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," third time's not the charm
","It feels like a transition movie, as the books become darker, obviously their celluloid counterparts will follow suit. But this film doesn't feel that dark, yet still managed to be less magical and less fun then the previous two films. Granted with 'Chamber of Secrets', the bar was sat extremely high, but this film is definitely missing Chris Columbus's touch. The good acting is there (Gary Olman is great in damn near everything), the good special effects are there, and it's nice to see Rupert Grint growing into his own skin a bit and not looking so weird looking. The substance so much displayed in the first two isn't there, the heart isn't there (not in the same degree at least). This is not to say the the third film isn't good, I DO like it. It's just the worst of the three and I'm glad that Alfonso Cuarón isn't directing the next film 'Goblit of Fire', as his eye is obviously meant for more pretentious Art-house cinema.My Grade: C+ 2-Disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', 'Harry Potter and the Chambers of Secrets', 'The Polar Express' & 'Elf' Disc 2) 5 Deleted Scenes; 11 minute and 50 second Creating The Vision featurette; 7 Interviews with cast & crew with Introduction With The Shrunken Head; Catch Scabbers Interactive Challenge; Choir Practice Sing-Along; Quest Of Sir Cadogan Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Honeydukes; Magic You May Have Missed Interactive Challenge; Self-Guided Interactive Tour of Lupin's Classroom; Care Of Magical Creatures featurette; Conjuring A Scene featurette; and Game PreviewDVD-Rom: Hogwart's Timeline; Trading Cards; Video game preview",7,1,4,20 September 2005
Bad Teacher," There might be something about Mary, there's nothing about Elizabeth
","Cameron Diaz Should think about firing her agent after starring in this insipid little film as Liz Halsey, a superficial sad sack of a teacher who's more interested in getting a boob job and finding a rich husband than actually doing her job. Actually It could've been funny based on that premise but sadly that's far from the case here. I can't recall laughing once, which confused me for a second as director Jake Kasdan has had a lot of great credits to his name in the past, but than I realized that both writers for this swill were involved in the 'year One' travesty and It all clicked into place.

He befriends the leader of said gang, Domenic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and finds himself falling for Dom's younger sister, Mia. The racing aspect of the film is pretty thrilling granted, but the story aspect of the film is way too derivative of 1991's 'Point Break', and this film can't help but suffers greatly from the comparison.My Grade: C-Original Out of Print edition (FAR superior to the 'Tricked out' Special Edition) DVD Extras: Commentary by Rob Cohen; 18 minute Making of Featurette; The article that inspired the movie; 8 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; 8 multiple camera angles, plus the final edit for a stunt sequence; Movie magic Interactive Special Effects featurette; 4 and a half minute Featurette on Editing For The MPAA; Visual Effects Montage; 2 Storyboard Comparisons; 3 Music Videos ('Furious' by Ja Rule, 'POV City Anthem' {Edited] by Caddillac Tah, and 'Click Click Boom' by Salivah); Soundtrack spot; a jump to the music menu; Production notes; cast & filmmaker bios; Theatrical Trailer; and promo spots for Universal Theme Parks & an Activision racing game 2 Easter Egg: There's a hidden steering wheel icon to the right of the Stunt sequence link on the main menu, click it for additional multiple angles; A hidden steering wheel can also be found on page one of the 'Racer X Article' DVD Rom: Wallpaper; Screensaver; Jukebox; mini-game; and an Activison Racing game demo",6,0,2,3 July 2005
Batman Begins," Falls a tad short of dethroning the Tim Burton original, but still a fine return to form
","The film begins with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) locked inside a Chinese prison. He thinks back on his childhood when he first fell into a bat cave, thus showing us how he got his fear of bats, as well as starting to explain why he choose his symbol of a bat for his eventual costume as a crime fighting vigilant. After his parents are murdered, he first wants to assassinate the guy responsible, Joe Chill. But then just forsakes his birth right and material wealth to find himself. Finding himself involving him leaving as a thief (but it's OK because he only steals his own stuff I guess, oh except food) and vagabond which leads him into the aforementioned prison. Ra's Al-Ghul wants Bruce to be part of a clandestine vigilante gang. He trains with them, yet bulks at being a killer of evil man. So he goes back to Gotham to be it's protector. He also has to deal with the Scarecrow. This is the best Batman film since the Tim Burton original, not to say it is without fault as that's not the case. Bale does a MUCH better Bruce Wayne than a Batman, which is merely serviceable, Katie Holmes is pretty much the weak link in this film, and the new Batmobile is...well the less said about that the better. It's also slightly longer than it should be and could've used a little trimming. It was entertaining yes, but it's also HIGHLY over-rated right now and doesn't really have any business in the Top 250, much less the top 100 movies of all time.My Grade: B-",8,1,5,22 June 2005

'Meet the Fockers' has Gaylord and gang meeting his parents played by Dustin Hoffman and Babs Striesand. But the fun-loving Fockers have to 'teach' that 'mean old' Jack (Robert DeNiro wasted like everyone else in the film) a lesson on how to loosen up. The laughs that could be found throughout 'Meet the Parents' not only thin to a trickle, but cease to exist entirely in this film., replaced with lame tired and cringe-worthy clichés.

","A biopic of Andy Kaufman by great director Milos Foreman who redeems himself complete after the lackluster whitewashing that was 'The People vs. Larry Flint'.

","Jason Statham is Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces operator who is now a transporter who has his own set of rules that he strictly abides by until he breaks them and opens a 'package' he's transporting that contains Qi Shu. This film is entertaining enough, if wholly unbelievable. You'll enjoy it if you turn off your brain and just roll with the action. Personally I expect more from Writer Luc Besson, but then again since 1995 he's only made fun and entertaining but not great films (with the two obvious exceptions of the original 'Taxi' and 'Danny the Dog' which were almost as superb as his pre-1995 movies) My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Both widescreen & Fullscreen editions of the film; Commentary by actor Jason Statham and producer Steve Chasma; a 12 minute Making Of featurette; 3 Extended / Uncut Fight Sequence with optional commentary; and Theatrical Trailer",6,1,2,22 October 2005

Virginia Madsen is on hand as his put-upon wife, Agatha.What could have been an intriguing enough movie and solid thriller was sadly hampered with the fact that everything is spelled out slowly and bluntly to the audience whom, one would suspect, the filmmakers seem to believe are slightly mentally retarded and have to be spoon fed from point A to point B like an unthinking lemming. It's extremely insulting to one's intelligence and just sunk the whole film for me. If it weren't for the dumbing down of the film, it would've been good.

Ghost Rider," Third time's NOT the charm for another awful Mark Johnson directed comic film
","A young Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) makes a deal with the demon,Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save his father. Years later, Blaze (now Nicolas Cage), a world renowned bike daredevil starts to turn into the Ghost Rider (sort of the devil's henchman who's job is to capture the souls of evil men. He also has to contend with Blackheart, a goth looking demonic villain whom is the least intimidating heavy in a film in recent memory. What's the saying about the third time being the charm? Well sometimes that's simply not true. Director Mark Johnson's third comic-book based film (after the dire Darevil and simply putrid Elektra) proves just that with this supremely boring joke of a film. Bad acting, a plot that fails to do the comic that it's based on justice, and an aforementioned supremely awful villain all collide to make this disaster such a chore to sit through. By the time that the Ghost Rider dons his trademark leather studded jacket, I was too bored to care, so later in the movie when Johnny Blaze utters 'is this thing ever gonna end?' it was like he read my mind. It's all fun and games till Johnson gets his hands on/ royally screws up a sincerely great comic-book, say something like 'Preacher' My Grade: D",2,15,30,7 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Halle's Hissy fit ruins the franchise
","Halle Barry had a hissy fit about her character Storm not getting as screen time as she wanted, so for better or worse (mostly the latter), Storm is pretty integral to the plot of this third film, which has to do with the Phoenix, a mutant cure, Magneto as Nazi, amongst other jumbled plot points that are crammed into the shortest running time of any x-man film. Of course to elevate Storm to leadership position and thus satisfy Barry's huge inflated ego, you would have to get rid of any better more rational choice of characters to lead he X-men. Rationality and good characterization be damned. Halle won an Oscar, she get's her way. Sadly we, the moviegoer pay the price with a movie that's under developed, character's that act out of character, and quite a few lame catch phrases (I'm the Juggernaut, bitch). I guess Mr. regular Joe Q. Public MAY like them as a lot of 'stuff blows up good', but readers of the comic? Not so much.My grade: C- DVD Extras: Audio commentary with director Brett Ratner, writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn; Second commentary with producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner and Ralph Winter; 13 Deleted scenes* with optional commentary from Ratner, Kinberg, and Penn; A minute long promo for the upcoming Simpsonns movie; Two theatrical trailers for this film; and Trailers for 'A Night at the Museum', 'Ice Age 2: The Meltdown','Thank You For Smoking', '24: Season 5', 'Elektra', 'Daredevil' and 'Fantastic Four' * Some copies of the DVD have 13 deleted scenes while others have 24, there is NO WAY of telling which you'll get, so it's a crap shoot & I got only 13",4,1,1,12 October 2006
Hellboy," Fairly solid
","A demon is found back in WW2-era England by some serviceman after some Nazi's conjure it up. Stricken with the rather unfortunate name of Hellboy, the demon grows up under the strict supervision of the American government, with other people with abnormalities. Now evil Rasputin is back to finish the job he had started back in the day and it's up to Hellboy, his new handler John Myers,(Rupert Evans) and his love and fellow freak Liz (Selma Blair) to put a stop to that. This was a pretty enjoyable film. Kind of like 'Indiana Jones' meets 'X-Files'. Ron Perlman does a good job with the loner, wisecracking persona of Hellboy.

Driven," Crashes and burns
","Stallone and Renny Harlin team up again almost a decade after the action packed 'Cliifhanger', but the outcome is not nearly as good in this tale of an emotionally scarred former racing star (Stallone) hired by car owner (Burt Reynolds) to teach a talented rookie how to go the distance and stay focused. It suffers from a supremely lack-luster storyline, auto-pilot acting and unexciting 'action'. Both Stallone and Reynolds, two formally great actors, gave me false hope that they would each return to excellent form (Sly in the superb 'Copland', and Burt for his great role in 'Boogie Nights'), but any good will that those two films bought them from me is sadly shot right down again with this atrocious effort.My Grade: D- DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Renny Harlin; 15 minute 'Making of' featurette; 10 minute featurette on the visual effects; 51 minutes of deleted scenes with Stallone Commentary; Cast and Crew Filmographies; Theatrical Trailer; and a trailer for the video game tie-in",3,0,2,25 June 2005

","In all likelihood I would've liked this film much better if i hadn't seen 'Lost in Translation' right before it. I couldn't help comparing the two while watching this movie. The acting doesn't seem to flow as naturally. There were funny parts of this film, yet it could've been more.

","An old embittered feeble Salieri (the great F. Murray Abraham) confine to an insane asylum tells a priest how Mozart (Tom Hulce) was a constant boon to his career always making him look far lesser in the greatness of Amadeus. Even with the film at 3 hours (the producer's cut), this film constantly kept my attention and I was hardly bored. The story while taking some liberties is still beautiful to behold. VERY well acted all around. With Abraham being the best ironically. The movie's soundtrack is very good, naturally. And this was one of the VERY few times that the Academy Awards got it right.

When that partnership doesn't work out as planned, and with Agent J on a mission that he needs all the help he needs, he goes out to make agent K remember and partner up once again to foil the plans of an alien spore in the guess of a centerfold model. This film was an obvious attempt to cash in on a franchise. And it obviously worked since it made oodles of cash. But as a true movie, it's a lost cause as it's just more of the same of the first movie. Minus the originality, and even the minuscule amount of charm that the first one had.

Brave," Falls short of Up, but still fantastic
","I took my two year old to see this on opening weekend and we both loved it, possibly me a tad more than her. The animation was amazing as is a natural for Pixar. The story (which i dare not spoil, as it's all the better going into the film not knowing) was heart-melting at times, I won't lie and tell you that I didn't start to tear up during a few scenes. The comedic parts of the film work spectacularly well, and while this film falls sort of the sheer greatness of Up, it's still the best children's films I've seen in years. If you have kids GO!!

8 Mile," Just a tad better than 'Cool As Ice'
","While being moderately well-acted and pretty well directed, it still smacks of 'been there, done that', wherein local boy finds success against & overcoming tremendous odds. Eminem decidedly tones down his msygonistic, homophobic, act to play Rabbit, the aformentioned 'local boy', in this semi-autobiographical rap movie. Kim Basinger plays his mother (not very convincingly, I might add) who constantly puts him down. An average movie at best that is too over-praised.My Grade: CDvd Extras: Eminem's free style rap battles; uncensored 'Superman' music video; Making of 8 Mile; & Music of 8 Mile; Theatrical Trailer Eye Candy: Nudity galore in the 'superman' video",Null,0,1,11 November 2003

Naturally the anti-social Shrek wants nothing to do with the invitation, but gives in to Fiona and Donkey's insistence. Needless to say the King is quite upset to find his daughter an Ogre and married to Shrek. Add the dastardly vain Prince Charming, a not so good Fairy Godmother and the delightful new addition of Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots, and you get a fun, but ultimately unneeded sequel that treads to closely to the first plot-wise.

","Theoretically, one could go into this movie knowing jack-all about the 'Grindhouse' & Shaw films that it's a homage to. But knowing about those movies, makes this one all the more better. I'm a tad of an afficionado on the aforementioned films, so the first 2 hours of 'Kill Bill' knocked me on my keister!! It was like a movie geek's (blood) wet dream.

","Jigsaw is back to his old cat and mouse gruesome antics, despite being captured by the police during an investigation into his murderous ways by jaded, divorced, and nearly burnt-out Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). Rather then see this as a setback, Jigsaw calmly informs him that Eric's son is now trapped in a booby-trapped house with 7 other people whom all share a secret past. I didn't particularly care for the first Saw , so imagine my surprise when i found this one marginally better, much better acted, and more gripping. It also has a better ending in my opinion (although i still hate cliff-hangers as a rule). I've only seen the first 3 films in the franchise thus far, this is my favorite as I think the third one is complete and utter excrement. Don't get me wrong Saw 2 still isn't a really good film, merely a better one then the others in the series (from what I saw) My Grade: C-",5,1,2,30 March 2008
Jerry Maguire," A tad overrated, but still enjoyable
","Tom Cruise is Jerry Maquire, a sports agent, who is stupid enough to feel a sense of remorse for seeing the contracts as being the number one prioty and writes an endless Mission statement going on and on about everything wrong with the way things are done, Needless to say he's fired soon afterwords. And needs to start anew, losing his fiancé, and most of his clientèle. The only two that choose to stick by him are a desperately clingy lady just wanted to be loved and a young up & coming conceited black football perspective with a nagging, holier than thou bitch of a wife. While Maqurie rise to the occasion and seize what he has left? This movie, while being one of Cameron Crowe's lesser works (basically an over-glorified chick flick) is still pretty good and better than Crowe/Cruise's next collaboration (the remake of 'Vannila Sky) by far. All of the actors acquit themselves as well as can be expected with the over-sentimentalized script. Plus you can't hate a movie with a young kid who says adorable things, that's why that tactic is used way to often in film. Even though it didn't accomplish the suspected job of making one feel good about oneself in the least bit. A woman so emotionally fragile that a guy only need to come see her and tell her 'Hello' before she crumples on the floor and worships the ground he walks on again?

So he decides to do the same thing, only realizing while the process is going on that he truly doesn't want to forget her. This is a beautiful film dealing with love, loss, grief, acceptance, anger, and the shades in between, that I almost gave up on watching (I tried to get into it before, but due to the unbearable slowness of the beginning I had turned off a little after the opening credits rolled). I'm so very glad that I gave it another chance, as I found it to be an extremely heartfelt,honest, and rewarding film. All the performances are pretty much spot-on and this is without a doubt Jim Carrey's best performance ever in a film, hands down.

","Ex-CIA operative, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) lets his 17 year old virgin daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace of 'Lost' fame) travel to Paris with her friend not knowing it's to follow the band, U2, when he gives his reluctant permission. It seems that daddy does indeed know best, as the girls are not in the City of Lights too long before they're abruptly abducted for nefarious purposes. Bryan is on the phone with Kim at the time and upon hearing what's happening, uses his CIA training and prepares to go all Jack Bauer on their collective asses.The middle to late 2000's have been great for Liam Neeson with fantastic roles in Batman Begins, Seraphim Falls, and a memorable videogamed role in the superb Fable 3. This film does nothing to change the mojo he currently possesses despite a slow start and a few action film clichés. Neeson is damn good in his role here and is quite the bad ass (a lot of people were surprised, I'm not one of those because I witnessed it in Seraphim Falls as well) and he carries the movie himself, as Maggie Grace just blew her role (I can't even begin to tell you how). Famke Janssen doesn't fare much better as Bryan's ex-wife, yet both these parts were relatively small enough to casually dismiss. This is Liam's movie through and through.My Grade: B",8,4,6,28 January 2009
Saw," Saw isn't too sharp
","Two people wake up chained to pipes on opposite ends of a room, the two must figure out how to get out. This film started off pretty well and stayed that way all the way to the first flashback where it all begin to unravel. I sat there dumbfounded as the movie got worse and worse. Seeing plot holes left and right. The acting ranged from bad to outright crap. The film is less like the roller-coaster ride it was billed as and more like a stupefying free-fall in quality. Everyone says 'oh the twist is cool' NOPE, I saw it coming (no pun intended) within five minutes of the start. Deemed one of the best horrors of the year?

When I was recently over a female friend's apartment, and her friend as well as her wanted to put on Harry Potter after hearing that I've never seen it, I just inwardly grimaced and went with it. I'm a fair person and I'll admit when I'm wrong. I was going into the film expecting to not like it at most and just be nonchalant to it at the least. But I was surprised to find it pretty good. Obviously made for kids, but so was 'Lybrinth' and 'the Dark Crystal' and those are both excellent movies. This film while not reaching the heights of the two previously mentioned films is engaging enough and I did enjoy it.

Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Sadly uses up all it's creative juices in the beginning
","Tenacious D rock, director Liam Lynch rocks, and the old HBO TV show rocks, so to say that I was looking forward to this film is an understatement. Making Meatloaf JB's father was a stroke of genius, but sadly nothing to do after the beginning his character disappears from the film (except for a lame hallucination). Dio having a cameo was great too sadly the movie can't live up to the admittedly great beginning opting to go the route of lame jokes and an uninspired plot. (roadtrip to find a fabled guitar pick made from Satan's tooth) Tenacious D deserves much better than this. Don't know if I'd even recommend it to die hard fans of the D, as owning the Masterworks collection, the first Cd, and seeing them in concert multiple times, I, myself might fall into that category.

He has to traverse the Chamber of Secrets to find out who's writing mysterious messages on the school hallways and why people have been petrified. It's up to Harry who has the ability to speak and understand snake talk to save the day. This sequel to an enjoyable little film is better because it can do away with the exposition that the first had to show, and concentrate more on the story, which is deeper and a tad darker than before. I even enjoyed Hermione more in this film, but as is true with the ying and yang, so is true with a hatred of a character in the film, and it's been transfered from Hermione to the awful character of Moaning Myrtle, yea I know she plays an integral part in the plot line of the film, but I still couldn't help but detest her.

Bit by bit, the daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) chips away at Creasy's hard exterior, which makes him take her eventual abduction all the more harder. And Creasy, now horribly wounded from the scenario, pledges to take down anyone even remotely involved in the kidnapping with methodical brutality that would make the recent 'Punisher' movie wince.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," way too Anchored, man
","Will Farrell, in his funniest movie since 'Old School', stars as ego-driven, chauvenistic, Ron Burgundy i this movie that sets itself in the 70's, when news shows were more or less a mens' business. The problem with the movie is the Ron gets emascalated far too quickly and the PG-13 rating hampers the comedy that much more. Not to be misunderstood, I did enjoy the film Steven Carrell as kind of a grown-up Ralph Wiggum, and the Jack Black cameo was one of the funniest things I've seen at the cinema in a while. It's just that so much more could've been done with the scenerio and it wasn't. Ron is seen as too incompetent, and Christina Appelgate's Veronica too good at everything she does. The Bush joke was also groan-worthy, it would've been good if EVERY comedy since 2001 didn't have at least one Bush joke.My Grade: C+",Null,1,3,11 July 2004

He is successful, but when Portugal acquires the colony the question of if the missions are still under the protection of the Chuch arises. This is a powerful movie, one that I appreciated much more then Roland Joffe's previously directed 'Killing Fields' which felt sanctimonious and one-sided. This film ,on the other hand, has breath-taking cinematography and well-developed characters. And while the film does falter in places (somewhat condescending and near the end over-preachy) the good far outweighs the bad.

Shooter," yet another action film thwarted by an agenda
","Mark Wahlberg breaks the good movie streak that he was enjoying after 'The Departed' and 'Invincible' to star in this typical action film with very liberal leanings. He plays Bob Lee Swagger (a pretty stupid name for an 'action hero' by the way)a jaded ex-military man who's called in to do one last job only to be double crossed by this whole 'right-wing' cabal of war profiteers. The now old stand-byes of criticizing the Iraq war are so passé that I'm jaded whenever they show up in Hollywood films anymore, so I let that one slide, up to that point the film kept it's politics fairly subtle. I mean you definitely knew which way it learned due to subtle hints & jabs until then, but the longer the film went on the more and more I cringed. I mean an ex-FBI guy wearing a freaking Che Guevara T-shirt is just utterly absurd. So by the time the whole all wars are for oil Haliburten-type evil bad guys' motives were revealed it was very expected. Don't get me wrong the movie was still fun in a purely superficial action no-brain kind of way, but if you even casually scratch the surface it's still rancid. Definitely would be a lot better if it weren't so partisan. I guess I'll have to put all my hopes on Rambo 4 to get my TRUE action movie fix.My Grade: C-",5,2,6,31 July 2007
The Terminal," Terminal is fading fast
","This Spielberg helmed tale VERY loosely based on the story of Iranian refugee, Merhan Nasseri, has Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, stuck in an American airport, rather than a French one (because if it was set in France, why couldn't have those great jabs at the Department of Homeland Security, right?) after his Visa is void thanks to his home country being in a state of upheaval. He must find a way to survive while the evil Homeland Security authority figure attempts to get him out of the airport. The film actually convinced me that it wasn't going to be a pretty good, albeit cute little film. Then the horribly miscast Mrs. Michael Douglas shows up as Viktor's love interest (cause, hey what good looking woman WOULDN'T want some homeless refugee man-meat?) and the film starts it's gradual decline into mediocrity. Hank's acting is great as alway, but everyone else, not so much. And I'm sorry Tom couldn't or shouldn't have to carry a film all by his lonesome. I'm still waiting for Spielberg to make another great movie (his last one I loved was 'Saving Private Ryan), but every film since than, has been a major disappointment in one way or another. This one perhaps more so, as the first 15 or 20 minutes showed much promise.My Grade: C-",4,1,5,4 July 2005
Carrie," One of De Palma's best (and the best King movie adaptation)
","Based on the Stephen King novel, this film details the ageless tale of Carrie White, social pariah thanks in no small part to her religious zealot mother, as she deals with being bullied.A great film is able to not only stand the test of time, but not become dated by the era that it was made. Carrie accomplishes both these tasks with aplomb. It still resonates as hard today as it did nearly 40 years ago (has it truly been that long? My how time flies) And even a couple truly atrocious remakes and ill-conceived sequel couldn't diminish the sheer power of arguably Brian De Palma's second best film.

Iron Man," the first great summer blockbuster of 2008 is Ironclad
","The latest superhero based film that comes down the pipeline is Iron Man,telling the origin of how billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) becomes Iron Man while captured by the enemy during wartime (updating the story, substituting the Koreans for the Taliban for obvious reasons) Casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was a stroke of genius given his highly public past escapades, and after seeing him as the hard-drinking, womanizing, wealthy industrialist turned superhero Iron Man by sheer necessity one would be hard pressed to view an other actor portraying him. Downey IS Stark and this is a primary reason why the movie works so well (there's a scene late in the movie where he has a scene that mirrors 'Less Then Zero', in look more than subject matter, that I quite enjoyed, but won't spoil here). Jeff Bridges holds his own very well as Obadiah Stane, Tony's main foil, but there's no stealing the spotlight from Robert in the least. This is fully his film.However even with the immaculate casting, the film only would be as good as it's storyline, fortunately here too it excels, remaining highly compelling and vastly entertaining (for the most part, of course a scene or two could've been trimmed a tad to tighten things up, it still works though). The direction by Jon Favreau is great as well and remarkably solid (even if the same can't of his role as Happy Hogan) All in all, this is the first great blockbuster of 2008 and will likely remain the best until the new Indiana Jones comes out. It already, without a doubt, ranks up with the best Super-hero movies made thus far.PS. Make sure to stay until after the credits for a nifty surpriseMy Grade: A-",8,4,8,9 May 2008

Seems that god wants to give him all of his powers to show him how hard it is. Jennifer Aniston is really not good in the part as Bruce's girlfriend in this one.

This film is one of the best in the admittedly tiresome 'Teen horror' sub-genre. If only the sequel wasn't such ass.My Grade: B DVD Extras: Commentary with James Wong, Glen Morgan, James Coblentz, and Jeffrey Reddick; Second commentary by Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Ali Larter, and Chad Donella; Isolated film score with commentary by Shirley Walker; cast and crew bios; 3 deleted scenes; A look at test screenings featurette; Premonitions featurette; Death clock game; Psychic test; and Theatrical Trailer DVD-Rom Extras: Script-to-screen, and original website",8,3,6,28 January 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still remains the best in the franchise
","Robert Englund, for better or worse, had his career shaped in this role as Freddy Krueger, a demonic bogeyman, enters the nightmares of teenagers that live on Elm Street to terrorize them with his homemade knife gloves as well as their own worst fears in this classic horror film that captured the hearts & minds of a generation, single handedly rescuing New Line from bankruptcy. Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) must figure out who this mysterious killer is and find some way to stop him despite her parents whom have something to hide. Thrilling, well-acted and having a very memorable villain, this film started a franchise wit subsequent movies never quite holding a candle to the original. In addition to it being a great horror movie, it's also notable for being Johnny Depp's debut on film. It's a damn shame that Langenkamp relied on a body double for the nude scene, only to expose her REAL assets in 'Nickel Mountain' only a year later.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Wes Craven, Director of Photography Jacques Haitkin, Actress Heather Langenkamp & Actor John Saxon; Cast and Crew Bios; and Jump to a Nightmare option (more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) DVD-Rom content: Trivia game; Screenplay; and web link",7,0,1,10 October 2005
Casino," Not as perfect as Goodfellas, but still very very good
","Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstien is trying to keep a tight, methodical operation as a mob-connected casino operator in Las Vegas of the '70's with his new love interest, Ginger (Sharon Stone, who is surprisingly not totally insufferable as she usually is, I guess she saved it up for the commentary). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) arrives under the Mob bosses desire to see that Ace's operations are running smoothly, but the more flamboyant, high risk taking Santoro, has plans of his own. Before long the 'civilized' lifestyle is offset by the more violent, devious excesses as it all begins spiraling downward. The performance of the movie are all great, the film keeps your interests throughout it's duration, and while this isn't as good as Scorsese/Pileggi's last collaboration, 'Goodfellas', there's still more than enough on display here to highly recommend this one as well. Although, this is based on a true story, names changed naturally, but I feel that this is probably a watered down version of what really happened.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone, Nicholas Pileggi, and Trailers for 'the Big Lebowski', 'Assault on Precinct 13', & 'Northern Exposure' Seasons 1-3. Side 2) 5 deleted scenes; 5 featurettes ( The Story, The Cast And Characters,The Look, After The Filming, & Vegas And The Mob; and the 44 minute 'History Alive: True Crime Authors Â– Casino With Nicholas Pileggi' documentary",8,2,4,26 August 2005
Heat," can't beat Heat
","Al Pacino and Robert Deniro are two sides of the same coin as cop and robber in this brilliant character action drama. Deniro is a master thief who s looking to put together one last huge score with his crew, while Pacino, a masterful detective is hot on his trail with his own crew attempting to take them down. Each is extremely dedicated to their respective jobs Each's life pretty much mirrors that of the other. Ying and Yang. Good and evil. With shades of gray in between. Every character in this film is given a back story and the plot is both fairly simple and intricate in it's fine details. Even at almost 3 hours, one never feels that the movie is ever dragging, because it doesn't. And yeah, you more then likely know how it's going to end before even sitting down to watch it, but it's not really about that. It's much more the journey that the destination. Highly recommended My Grade: A- 2-disc special edition DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by Director Michael Mann; and 3 Theatrical Trailers Disc 2) 'The Making Of Heat' 3-part documentary; 2 featurettes (Pacino And De Niro: The Conversation, & Return To The Scene Of The Crime); and 11 Deleted Scenes",9,1,3,1 September 2005
300," for a history lesson, look elsewhere, but it's good entertainment none the less
","Anyone who'd go see this film about 300 Spartans who hold off the endlessly vast Persian army expecting a history lesson of any sort would be well off picking up a book sometime. No, the order of the day is heavily stylized violence and a good Frank Miller adaption. Well-acted given the superficial tone of the film. Having the feel of the epic 'Braveheart' (but not excelling to the greatness of that modern day classic), I did enjoy the film for what it was. Of course they will be some tools who use the film to promote a given agenda, be it liberal or conservative. (but such is the case with any film touching on the subject of war of any kind). Try to ignore those conversations as both sides are looking too deeply in a movie this shallow. Perhaps the film would have been better if they played it a little more straight and nixed the elements that bring the film into the fantasy realm, however Gerarld Butler pretty much nailed the role of King Leonidas (grossly glaring inaccuracies aside) and Director Zack Snyder, who's already accomplished the impossible by making a horror remake that was not only watchable, but able to stand on it's own merits, has another winning film to add to his short but not insubstantial resume.My Grade: B+",8,6,13,12 March 2007
Cube," hip to be square
","A group of stereotypes (the math geek (Nicole Deboer from 'Dead Zone' series fame) ,lesbian, mentally disabled guy, an architect, and a cop) are trapped in this mysterious cube. I DID like the film even if they wen't the all too familiar route of having the authority figure be the bad guy and the man-hating moronic feminist be pure of heart. But it moves at a fairly quick pace. And the ending is pretty good as well. Don't go into this one expecting to be spoon-fed all the answers though, as some things are open to interpretation. Followed by a completely dreadful sequel and a prequel that I have yet to see. But ANY film that gets a better DVD release in France, gets me a wee bit mad.DVD Extras: Commentary; Storyboards; 3 deleted scenes; upshot sequence; Interview with Nicole DeBoer; Theatrical trailer; trailer for Cube 2 My Grade: B",8,0,2,18 December 2004
Sin City," oh Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
","Having supposed to have seen this on opening night, stuff always came up, so here I am commenting on it a day after seeing it two weeks after it opened. Hey better late then never. This is without a doubt one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book that I've ever seen is this one based on Frank Miller's niorish Sin City. I've always been a fan of both Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. Honestly, a fan of Willis by a bit more, so seeing him as Hartigan was great and I liked how he played him. But Rourke as the no nonsense hard-boiled Marv steals this movie. There's no doubt in my mind that it's Mickeys best performance in quite a while (almost enough to make me forget the horrid '1941' and 'Heaven's Gate') Rourke just took the ball and ran with it. Now, yeah, this is a grisly violent film, but somehow, maybe due to how it was shot, one can at least detach one's self from the violence. Or at least that was the case for me. Is it over-rated by being in the Top 250? A reluctant yes, as this is far from a perfect film, (the middle story, while fun, pales in comparison with the other two, some silly dialog, etc...) but it's still a very enjoyable one. And if overly clichéd crap like 'American Beauty', 'The Matrix', and 'Mystic River' can find a place in the top 250, then I won't begrudge this one if it stays there.My Grade: A-Eye Candy: Carla Gugino and Jamie King both have nude scenes and both are VERY stunning",8,1,2,17 April 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Choose wisely
","Harrison Ford is back as Indiana Jones in this first true sequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. This time he teams up with his father (Sean Connery) who was captured trying to find the fabled Holy Grail before the Nazis's get to it first. We get to find out where Indiana got both his hat and his name. As well as many more thrills, cliffhangers, and awesome sights. This was an amazing finish to a utterly superb trilogy. I don't have high hopes for the 4th installment coming out soon. They should have kept it a true trilogy. So choose wisely, choose to own all three of these amazing films.My Grade: A+ DVD-Rom content: an exclusive web link to get picture galleries, a PC game demo, and Raiders Animatic: Opening the Ark",9,1,1,25 August 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," reigns supreme among other early 2000 action movies
","Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne in this superb sequel to the great 'Bourne Identity*.This movie starts pretty much where the previous one left off, with Bourne trying to live a simply life in the quiet village of Goa, India with Marie (Franka Potente of 'Run Lola Run', 'Blow', and 'Anatomy'). and trying to piece together his nightmares and memories of his still mostly forgotten life. But shortly thereafter he is found by an assassin resulting in the death of a loved one, so now true to his word that 'if I even feel somebody behind me, there is no measure to how fast and how hard I will bring this fight to your doorstep.' from the previous film, he again must take up arms and see to it that the people responsible must pay.Whereas while going into the first film wondering and slightly hesitant to know if Matt Damon could pull an action film role off, I want into 'Supremecy' knowing that this was one part Damon was born to play and he didn't disappoint. In fact all the actors, from Brian Cox all the way down to Franka Potente played their parts with equal aplomb. And the game of cat and mouse was both thrilling as well as captivating, if there was one major flaw in this film, it would have to be the way that certain fight sequences were filmed, at times borderline incomprehensible. Shame because the rest of the film is truly fantastic.My Grade: A- DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Paul Greengrass; 5 Deleted Scenes; 9 Featurettes (Casting, Kepping it Real, Blowing things up, On The Move With Jason Bourne, Fight Training, Crash Cam, The Go-Mobile Revs Up The Action, Anatomy Of A Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene, & Scoring With John Powell; Cast & Filmmakers Biographies; and Trailers for 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Collateral', 'Miami Vice' Season 1, & 'Las Vegas' Season 1",9,3,4,24 April 2008
The Simpsons Movie," warmed over overly long episode of the Simpson felt like it could've been on Fox in segments
","Matt Groening and company are unmitigated geniuses I tell you. If their plan all along was to make the regular Simpsons TV show and make it progressively more and more awful, such as the case of the series for the last 7 years, and get it to the point of sub-par barely watchable shell of the glory that it once was. And if they did all that JUST to come out with this movie that while never NEVER reaching the classic status of Simpsons yesteryear, yet still much better then the series proper is only to have it viewed as some kind of Oscar-worthy film. Well all I can say is very well played indeed sirs. For those of us that remember how good the series truly was, this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans, this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive (IE: Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN, Lisa finding a crush AGAIN, even a few jokes are repeated from the series) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium (yes i know, I shudder at that thought as well) The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling. But again if one is fed a steady diet of feces and then given a moldy stale pork rind, it'd likely taste like top cuisine.My Grade: D+",4,14,27,31 July 2007
Dodgeball," at least better then Rollerball, just not as funny
","Vince Vaughn leads a group of assorted misfits into a dodgeball tournament to save his gym from being bought by Ben Stiller's gym franchise. Well leads is to strong a word, as Vince just seems to go with the flow throughout the film. Are we that needy for good comedies that we elevate a below-average one into the status of 'mordern day classic'?? Apparently so as many of the people I know sung it's high praises when this came out. The truth is, this is nowhere near as funny as either 'Old School' OR 'Bad Santa' and the only laughs to be had come from not Stiller nor Vaughn, but from Rip Torn who steals every single scene he has in the movie as wheelchair-bound Patrick O'houlihan. Without him 'Dodgeball' would have been out in the preliminaries.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Commentary with Rawson Thurber, Ben Stiller, and Vince Vaughn; 7 deleted scenes; Training for Dodgeball featurette; Anatomy of a hit featurette; Justin Long: A study in ham and chess featurette; go for the gold featurette; gag reel; 2 theatrical trailers; Trailers for season 1 of 'Arrested Development' and 'the Ringer",4,0,1,12 January 2005
Rock Star," NOT a metal movie
","Marky Mark is the lead singer in a cover band and gets to play with the band he worships after the fire their lead singer in this dud 'inspired VERY loosely by' the story of Tim Owens of Judas Priest. The basic story of guy craves fame, gets it, screws a transvestite, parties, loses girl, quits band to cut his hair and become a poof in a coffeehouse band, gets girl back, the end. There are so many things that don't work well in this movie. Jennifer Aniston is miscast. The ending is the biggest pile of horse manure.And you don't make a movie about metal and then have a lame soundtrack, among other things. Writer John Stockwell wrote Cheaters and Blue Crush so in retrospect it's no surprise that this movie blows. The only good parts were some of the acting, and that Zakk Wylde is in it. That's pretty much it.My Grade:D+ DVD Extras: Commentary with Stephen Herek; Making-of featurette; Everclear music video; cast & crew bios; and Theatrical Trailer Eye Candy: Various big breasted groupies show what they got",2,3,6,21 January 2005
