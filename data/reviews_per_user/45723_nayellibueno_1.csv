Saturday Night Fever," A hot dancer, dances the night away
","This movie has literally changed my life for the better good. I was on the verge of killing myself until i heard the bee-gees sweet nectorous voices. They helped me believe in myself again. The moment I saw John Travolta in his hot little pants it almost stopped my already weak heart. My friends always shoot me down when I talk about the connection Johnny and I have, but it'll never cease our burning passionate love. Its a MUST SEE FLICK. You almost grow up and the movie shows John Travolta become a man and learn to love and older broad. The music really gets my blood pumping. Its the perfect soundtrack to listen to while giving birth or even driving to your orthodontist appointment. I have to find another man who will understand me and will want to dance to this at our wedding.",7,0,1,20 May 2016
