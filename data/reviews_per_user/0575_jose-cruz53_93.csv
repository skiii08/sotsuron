The King's Speech," Worthy of the Oscar
","The King's Speech was a worthy Oscar winner, one of the best films I watched in the year. It is very well executed with good to excellent performances from everyone involved in the film. The cinematography is also very good and the soundtrack features the second movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony, one of the best pieces of classical music.The plot revolves around the personal problems of the king of England in dealing with his speech impediments and the social bonds he formed with the people involved (the speech doctor and his family, mostly).Overall, it is not a masterpiece, but it is not a simple forgettable film either.",8,0,1,3 January 2013
The Avengers," A well made and entertaining blockbuster
","Superheroes are not prime film material: I would probably never include a superhero film among my favorite 100 films, maybe Watchmen, but that's not really a 'superhero film' but instead a deconstruction of the genre. Anyway, some are highly entertaining, such as Spider Man 2 and Batman: The Dark Knight, but nothing that really send chills down my spine, induces into goosebumps or makes my eyes wet.It has some very cool, awesome moments, but it is not like The Matrix awesome: Its mediocre/okay awesome. It is a highly overrated film here in the IMDb, it is surely not top 250 material in any way, shape of form. I was disappointed when I saw the film, because it had a 8.7 score on IMDb at the time. Obviously, the product of nerdgasmic reaction to an accurate depiction of the characters in the comics. Anyway, I don't read superhero comics, so...",7,4,9,17 October 2012
Vertigo," Very good film, given the date it was made
","I am not the biggest fan of Hitchcock. Here, however, I found a very interesting film. Its a psychological thriller, like the other films by Hitchcock, which try to active the reptile part of our brains. Though, in this case, we have an exceptional case. The overall quality of the film is very high and I understand why this film is regarded as Hithcock's best among film critics and why it was placed first in the last Sign and Sound pool. It was placed first in the Sign and Sound pool because every film critic had his Hitchcock film to report among their top 10 favorite films, given that Hitchcock is considered the greatest director ever and this is obviously the 'best' film by Hitchcock, though it is not my personal favorite (Psycho is my favorite). But it is very good and I highly recommend it.",9,3,6,2 October 2012
Black Swan," Excellent offering from Aronofsky
","Aronofsky is proving himself to be one of the best directors working on film these days. Black Swan is very similar to the Wrestler in tone and execution, since both are films about a main character who works in an undervalued art form (ballet and wrestling) and both suffer from deep psychological problems (and in this case, from deep psychiatric problems). This one, however, has better production values, better cinematography and uses special effects extensively.It also features one of the best lesbian sex scenes in recent cinema. Perhaps better than the one on Mulholland Drive, since here the girls are even hotter.",8,0,2,3 January 2013
Men in Black 3," Reasonably entertaining
","While this film isn't very popular among critics I found it to be reasonably entertaining but completely forgettable. In fact, I have watched it a few months ago and I barely remember the plot now. Overall, I found it a solid film for the crowds. Solid entertainment for the masses. It doesn't reach the heights of the first film (which weren't that high) but it doesn't fall as low as MIB 2, which sucked, big time. This one is more solid and well executed.So what can I say about it? Well, I liked that the villain always said: 'Let's agree to disagree.' Which is the most memorable thing in the film.",6,3,5,23 December 2012
Come and See," Soviet propaganda disguised as an art film
","The best thing I can say is: watch Grave of the Fireflies instead, it is one million times better, more realistic and is not as biased as this film.Come and See is a WW2 film about the horrors of war. However, it is not remotely as good as people seem to think it is. I found it terribly mediocre and extremely boring. The characters lacked real emotion and the sadness seemed really forced, each character behaved in a very strange manner and nobody looked like real people. Instead they moved around like corpses without emotion.Also, the cinematography looks very amateurish, as if I had shoot this film at my backyard. The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all.And I liked some Russian movies, like those by Tarkovsky, which are monumental pieces of art.Besides being a failure as a film it is also a piece of Soviet propaganda. Indeed, it shows WW2 as 'the nice Soviets versus the evil Germans', however, that is ludicrous. They depict the German soldiers as Nazi devils without any hint of humanity and driven by the sole purpose of exterminating the Soviet population. However, the truth is that German soldiers were people just like the Soviet civilians and while there were a few psychopaths in the SS, the vast majority were normal people.Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form. Saving Private Ryan is also very unrealistic, but in another way. Both films fail to attain realism and depict the war in a satisfactory way. Both firms have an anti-German bias and a nationalistic bias. The general problem with WW2 films is that any film made in a country that won the war tends to have nationalistic biases and so they tend to be really offensive and become implicit propaganda. This movie is not implicit propaganda, it is explicit propaganda of the Soviet regime, which had Joseph Stalin at its helm at the time, a murderous regime equal to Nazi Germany in their lack of humanity.The good WW2 films are always German or Japanese. Since losing the war make them more humble and they don't tend to depict their enemies as inhuman monsters.Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit. I give it the minimum score because of its extreme pro-Soviet bias, which makes the film offensive and indeed Soviet propaganda. Ignoring the bias I would give 5/10, since it is a mildly interesting film for WW2 buffs.Obs.: I have not seem 100% of the film, in the middle parts I slept for 20 minutes, due to its boring nature.",1,40,137,29 September 2012
Howl's Moving Castle," Another great entry by the master of the medium of animation
","This film has perhaps the highest animation quality ever. It is truly stupendous: the mountains and skies are painted with such a beauty that it makes it appear really stupid that some film studios are making animated films in CGI, which looks like plastic dolls. This, on the other hand, is real art and it looks stupendous.The film doesn't have a well defined story, instead, it is quite an art- house film that doesn't follow the Hollywood conventions but at the same time it was a quite popular film in Japan, becoming the third highest grossing film in Japanese history after Titanic and Spirited Away (indeed, Avatar's gross in 2009 wasn't high enough to surpass this film).This combination of artistic value with entertainment value is what makes Miyazaki's film so special.",10,0,1,16 November 2012
Source Code," Perhaps one of the best films of 2011
","I am extremely rigorous with my scoring system: I give 8/10 only for excellent films, only the top 1% of all films. So this film is indeed quite special.Duncan Jones is proving himself to be a quite superb director in making another excellent film only two years after his highly acclaimed debut, Moon, which I would rate slightly higher but still a 8/10 film.Overall, this film combines a highly sophisticated science fiction concept with a highly thrilling execution. It is a very well made entertaining flick. Though it is not a masterpiece of cinema. Highly recommended for science fiction fans.",8,1,3,15 November 2012
The Hangover," Extremely funny
","The Hangover is one of the best dumb movies I have watched in a long time. It is clearly superior to the six or seven other recent comedy films I have watched (dated from 2009 to 2012).The plot is pure nonsense but it is executed quite brilliantly. Overall, a very funny movie and one that should be watched once, but never twice: the fun of these dumb comedies comes from the jokes, which are not funny in a second round. Recommended for everyone but doesn't expect anything artistically sound. In terms of artistic value I would rate this about 3/10, but since it doesn't try to be art it deserves the high score I gave it. At least this is anything but pretentious.",8,0,2,3 January 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Excellent adventure film but not the best ever
","This movie consists of 110 minutes of pure escapist fun. That's the shortest accurate description of it: Its a flawless adventure film, vastly superior to its mediocre sequels (specially the Crystal Skull one a film mediocre par-excellence).The film takes place in the late 1930â€²s and opens with Indiana Jones, a professor of archaeology which also does 'freelance work' by robing ancient sites of its most valuable possessions, captures an invaluable Inca gold statuette. Later the film progresses to the main plot: the Nazis appear to have discovered the general location of the Lost Ark, which is said to house the actual 10 commandments. The film then progresses around the conflict of finding and possessing the Ark.So, if the film is flawless why not give a perfect score? Because, although it is excellent, the film does not reach greatness to the point of really making me say: 'what a f*cking great film', after seeing it. Its perfect entertainment, but it is not the greatest adventure film ever made (to me, Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is the greatest adventure film ever made, superior to this one in nearly every respect).",8,0,1,29 September 2012
Casablanca," I found it mediocre
","Set in the early 1940â€²s, when WW2 was ranging and the outcome of the conflict was still far from clear. Casablanca is the name of a town in the coast of North Africa that was a focal point in gathering people from all the countries involved in the war, from refugees from occupied France to Americans seeking to make out a living out of this growing consumer market generated by this focal point. The main character is an American that owns the most popular bar in the town, where 'the action happens'.I found this movie to be rather boring and mediocre, it's a typical love story movie. Nothing special and is a film full of clichÃ©s. True, it is from 1942, which may not have been clichÃ© at the time, and in fact may have become clichÃ©d due to this film massive influence over the next decades on the rest of Hollywood. However, I am not interested in originality and influence here, but on the pleasure that I derived from viewing the film. Regarded by many as among the greatest films ever made, I found it completely mediocre. Maybe it is this high degree of mediocrity that allows to be so highly regarded. As something that pleases everyone is something that cannot be really great to anyone.Anyway, I am not a great fan of very old films. I generally find them either clichÃ©d and/or technically inferior to relatively more recent films (i.e. made in the 1960â€²s onwards). However, I found Citizen Kane, from 1941, to have been excellent. This, on the other hand, I found to be the definition of a mediocre clichÃ© ridden film.",5,3,11,29 September 2012
Chinatown," A bit boring, I did not find this film very engaging at all
","So, in my journey through the IMDb top 250 I think that outside of planet Ingmar Bergman I have never encountered a less engaging film than this one: it was truly hard to take on this film, which is different than actually hating it: it is just that I think a film should be more driven by audio-visual processes rather than dialogue: 2001: A Space Odyssey, for instance, is one of such films, another is Apocalypse Now, but this is not one of such films: it seems to last forever and the whole film feels like it was made in the 1930's.Indeed, this Neo-Noir style of film making does not appeal to me. My grandma, though, would probably like this film. But young people (people under 35) of the Star Wars generation will probably not like this film very much. I recommend this film to those that love 1930's and 1940's flicks, such as Casablanca (which also did not impress me).",3,7,19,15 October 2012
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of the greatest comedies ever made!
","This film is epic. While it doesn't contain as many jokes as The Holy Grail, it makes up by having a better story, way better in fact, and overall a much stronger overall sense of being a whole film, instead of a simple sequence of jokes. This finally magnifies the whole comedic experience of watching the film, since the jokes become stronger and it is more like a a film-length episode of Seinfeld, where the 'main' joke is constructed during the whole length of the episode.This film is obligatory for someone who likes films, I would rank it as the third of the second greatest comedy ever made (the first is Dr. Strangelove, of course).",9,1,3,27 October 2012
Unbreakable," Good
","Its well acted and well structured. I found it interesting, but I wasn't moved by it to a very high degree. Still, it was better than 90% of the films I have seem up in the past few years. The whole concept of creating a 'real' superhero film is very nicely done and one begins to wonder if Bruce Willis' character really does have superpowers or not, though in the ends things become rather well defined.The villain, Mrs. Glass, however, is rather strange since his 'power' affects him negatively: it is a disease and therefore makes him a super- weak being. Which is not something I would have expected from what is supposed to be the antagonist in this comic bookish film, and the director plays that card quite well: it makes it more interesting to watch than 'The Avengers', the gold-standard superhero film.",8,0,0,21 October 2012
Akira," Excellent action/sci fi film
","Akira is one of the most important films in the history of Japanese animation. Mainly because it broke new ground in making an adult, extremely violent and visually stunning film that greatly influenced the design and themes of later anime films. However, I do not think this film is among the greatest anime films of all time, I think that Miyazaki alone made about 6-7 films superior to this one. That's because I did not find the characters and the plot as engaging. The level of emotional deepness is not comparable to Miyzaki's output, also, the soundtrack is not as 'great' as well. It was an excellent, but flawed movie, like Citizen Kane, which I watched in the same day.The animation has a flowing quality like no other anime film I ever saw. And the story is interesting, basically about government funded research on the manipulation of an a semi-mystical ethereal quality that living beings have with the purpose of producing 'super humans', probably for military use. It's said that the first time such attempt had been tried in 1988, a world war followed due to the awakening power, which had destroyed the massive city of Tokyo. The film is set in 'the future', 2019, when another awakening is occurring. Basically, havoc happens and we are for a treat of awesomeness.It's an excellent action/science fiction film.",10,0,3,29 September 2012
Citizen Kane," Great, though still a flawed film
","While considered by some film critics as the 'greatest movie of all time' not only because of it's quality but also because of it's high level of innovation, both in terms of further exploring the possibilities of film, special effects and also in technical terms. This is an excellent film. It is perhaps one of the oldest films that I have ever watched, perhaps only some Disney and Chaplin films (such as Snow White and Modern Times) are actually older.So, how this holds up compared to modern movies? Quite well actually. The technical quality of the movie is far superior to 7 Samurai, for instance, the camera work is very well done and the effects work quite well. The main problem of the movie is that as it is very old it requires more patience from the audience as films those days were not as tingly edited and composed, instead this less refined version of the art still has a loot of rough edges. Scenes take took long, dialogue is a bit overlong and complex, which increase the costs of watching the film with attention.Still, despite it's technical limitations if compared to modern movies, Citizen Kane still holds quite well if one is willing to sit through it's entire duration. It's a very powerful film and I would consider it the best movie that I ever saw made before the 1960Ã¢â‚¬Â²s.I would recommend There Will be Blood, for someone who has liked this film.",9,0,1,29 September 2012
The Hunger Games," Entertaining canned Hollywood flick for teenager girls
","While being a film marketed for young teenager girls, this film has a quite broad appeal, like everything that Hollywood makes today seeks to appeal to the broadest possible demographic. This film is no different. It is competently directed and acted, though it has some very cheesy scenes.Some parts of the film have so much cheese that they manage to make me feel nauseous. However, even though it is a deeply flawed film, it still managed to entertain me.One interesting thing about the film is the fact that it is very violent, though it doesn't show much blood and guts, but it still is remarkably violent considering it appears to be a film made for 13 year old girls! These days the increasing degree of violence in films has affected even these girly films. Compare this film with Kiki's Delivery Service, a Japanese film targeted at 13 year old girls made in 1989, there nobody gets seriously hurt in any scene!",6,0,2,24 October 2012
Argo," Very good thriller
","Ben Affleck, the celebrity film star who I though was bald but apparently has a loot of hair in this film, has directed a very good film. Indeed, he has talent for directing and writing flicks. This is a good example of a very solid thriller film based on real events. I will not talk about the plot here because I don't think that plot matters for most movies: the premise is basically this: the CIA has to deal with a situation where you have to evacuate a bunch of people from a hostile country. And this film shows how they done it, adding a bit of melodramatic touches to increase tension (specially the ending!).However, this film is not art and it doesn't pretend to be art. It is good escapist entertainment and it will keep you always entertained during its nearly two hours duration.",7,0,1,23 January 2013
12 Angry Men," One of the best 'old films'
","I found this film to be very compelling. There isn't any action, any special effects, any journey and anything beyond 12 men in a room arguing and it is great. The acting was perfect and the main theme was very interesting.Anyway, this is a film that has some serious gray matter: The individual has by right that he/she is always innocent unless proved guilty and the film debates this question. Also, there is the question of bias affecting judgment of the jury relating to the social class of the individual under judgment.Highly recommended film, one of the best of old-school cinema (which I am not particularly fond of).",9,1,2,6 October 2012
Oldboy," Excellent thriller
","One of the best films of 2003, all the way. A tour de force of emotions and very well executed. Its quite brutal and may scare people under 12. However, for people who appreciate films that are not that simple clichÃ© ridden stories here is a fine treat.The score is also very good, since it contains even a little Vivaldi, which I appreciate in a film. The score is always a vital part of a film and here we are well treated.The film is flawed, however, some parts are not perfect and overall, it may feel a bit forced at times. But, overall, it appears to be one of the 10 finest films of the decade. Highly recommended.",8,0,5,25 October 2012
Batman Returns," Funny Batman comedy
","Its a quite decent film. In fact, nearly as good as the newest Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises, though it is on a very different vein: this film should be watched as a dark comedy. To say that it is dark film is rather silly in my opinion: everything looks like it was made of cardboard and everything looks fake and harmless. The main villain is rather pathetic and doesn't appear to be serious in any part of the film. Overall, a quite entertaining film but nothing that one could call: a dark masterpiece, as some people had said before about this film. Tim Burton is not the greatest filmmaker ever: his films are cute cardboard looking fantasies, but they fail to attain any sort of greatness a-la-Stanley Kubrick.",7,0,5,21 October 2012
Finding Nemo," Solid storytelling from Pixar
","Pixar has always been masters of their craft: making excellent children's movies. Indeed, this is among their top 5 best, perhaps, as it not only deals with subjects that interest children but also seeks to teach their parents something very important: to not overprotect their children since the kids need to tackle the world in order to grow, even if they are under some risk, the fact is that the parents need to accept the dangers of the world and that it is impossible to protect their children absolutely.The main character of the movie is an overprotective father who lost 99% of his unborn children (i.e. eggs, since he is a fish) and his wife due to the attack of a very large and powerful predator fish. Traumatized by the experience he overprotects his only remaining offspring but when he loses his child he embarks on an adventure to find him again, hence the name of the movie.",7,0,1,8 January 2013
Alexander," The Second Worst Film Ever Made
","This is one of those films that are so bad, but so bad, that they become good! Particularly, Colin Farrell gives a performance for the ages, but not in the good sense (irony).This film tries to depict the life of Alexander the Great, possibly one of the most awesomely powerful individuals that have ever lived. But instead the film depicts a poor miserable creature that wouldn't be capable of conquering an ant.The battle scene of Gaugamela, however, is completely different and much superior to the rest of the film. Here we have the single most realistic depiction of an ancient battle in film ever made. Indeed, without this battle this film would have been even worse, possibly surpassing the current leader (Dune). I like to watch this battle on youtube, but always try to avoid the awful lecture Farrel gives",7,0,0,7 October 2012
My Neighbor Totoro," My Neighbor Totoro â€“ Miyazaki, 1988
","My Neighbor Totoro is in my honest opinion one of the best movies I ever had the chance to see. It's absolutely perfect in every respect: the soundtrack is simple and beautiful, the animation is of excellent quality, with beautiful painting landscapes, the characters are amazingly realistic and is perhaps the ultimate children's movie. It's a flawless diamond of cinema and was rightly included among the 250 greatest movies ever made list by Sign and Sound.One day I watched this movie together with Citizen Kane and Akira and it easily 'overpowered' both of these films (in terms of engaging my emotions). It's much more humane and engaging than 99.9% of all other films, animated or otherwise. The film also flows seamlessly and makes you pay attention without any effort, something that most movies have difficulty in attaining (a particularly extreme example would be Citizen Kane).This movie is considered to be Miyzaki's most personal film, as it reflects his childhood in Japan of the 1950â€²s. Though I don't really care that much about how personal a film is to a director besides it's effect on the emotions produced by the film. Other Miyazaki films also had a very strong emotional effect without any personal connection with the director, for instance, Kiki's Delivery Service takes place in an alternate history European city and it is about equal to Totoro in my book.I have argued previously that Miyazaki films (as other Studio Ghibli films) are extremely aggressive. Indeed, this film is like being hit in the head repeatedly by a 10-ton stone made of pure cuteness over a period of 90 minutes: every minute of the film consists of scenes evoking these strong emotions, structured around a simple basic story to minimize noise and we can really fell like the protagonists during the course of the film, it reveals the inner child of anyone. A masterpiece of simplicity and yes, cinematic aggressiveness.",10,0,2,29 September 2012
The Prestige," One of the best films by Nolan
","I first should note that I am very rigorous regarding my scoring system. I give 7/10 only for very, very good films, perhaps only for the top 3-2% of all films (I gave Vertigo a 7/10, for instance), so 7/10 should be interpreted as a very good film, but not a masterpiece.I liked it very much, the characters are well constructed and strong and the performances are memorable and good well around. The ending has a very cool twist as well, though nothing really special: Nolan's films are very entertaining, but he is not a Stanley Kubrick and never will be. Don't watch these films expecting masterpieces, as some of Nolan's fanboys might think. But expect instead high quality entertainment.",7,1,2,5 October 2012
The Terminator," The best thriller ever made!
","While people, specially directors, admire Hitchcock's thrillers, what we have here is pretty much an action thriller packed with more emotional firepower than any Hitchcock film. Its a classic film and obligatory for anyone who loves films to see.It is also a very 80's film: much like Back to the Future in terms of its 1980's feeling, though it is a very different film, one is a comedy while this one is a horror/action/thriller.The basic premise is also one of the best in the history of cinema: a time travel paradox is actually build up in the film in such a way that the ending fits the beginning perfectly. Proving that James Cameron is indeed a very smart director.",10,4,5,15 October 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Perhaps the best comedy ever made
","This film is truly great. Truly. It is flawless and represents one of the few old movies (which I define as films made before 1977, the year in which Star Wars was released) that I give a perfect 10 score (the other 2 would be The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and 2001). Yes, I am not that a big fan of Hitchcock, Kurosawa and Bergman to give for any of their films perfect scores.This one is different, it was truly entertaining and represented a very moving cinematic experience. It did not feel like an 'old' film, as Kubrick's films tend to age much better than those films made by other directors.",10,2,5,27 October 2012
The Expendables," Funny and entertaining
","This film never took itself seriously and was bashed critically. It isn't art and doesn't try to be. It isn't dramatic and doesn't try to be. It tries to be a ton of fun and succeeds, mostly, in the regard. It is also aware of itself as a film: the dialogue makes the viewer understand that the actors are in a movie and not taking anything seriously which wasn't the right decision in my mind because it weakened the film too much: it became too dull and lacked any dramatic impact as I knew everything wasn't happening 'for real' and since this film isn't art: it's soundtrack and visuals aren't artsy but are simple action tropes, thus it cannot be understood as art but only as an action movie that depends on tension to create a situation.",6,0,4,2 January 2013
Taxi Driver," Superb but not a masterpiece
","Taxi Driver is widely considered by film critics as one of the greatest films ever made. It is indeed an impressive work of cinematic art and a very powerful unforgettable film. However, I would say that it is not flawless and it doesn't achieve everything.One of the major problems of this film was the lack of rationality regarding the behavior of the main character. Of course, that was the whole point of the film, but the way Scorsese did it was to make him take out a girl on a date to watch a porn film! That's ludicrous. Nobody with two working neurons would ever act in such a way. While film doesn't need and shouldn't be realistic one has to make the viewer engage in suspension of disbelief and to make a taxi driver take a girl on a date to see a porn film is more ludicrous on context than anything in the Lord of the Rings films.Final rating: 9/10, it is superb but not a timeless masterpiece.",10,0,0,5 November 2012
Barry Lyndon," A perfect film
","A magnificent film, Barry Lyndon is pretty much a perfect overview of the 18th century European world, from the perspective of our protagonist, Redmond Barry. I consider Kubrick as one of my favorite directors (if I would be forced to rank him I would place him second on my list). Stunningly beautiful, in both visual and audial senses, its a movie to slowly contemplate. Indeed, Roger Ebert choose this film as one of his top 10 film of all time in 2012 for the Sign and Sound pool. It was a worthy choice as this film is perfect.The cinematography is beyond perfect. Kubrick planned to make each frame of this film look as much as possible as an 18th century paintings and indeed, each frame can be hanged over the wall. The film's score is also amazing, featuring a combination of 18th century classical music and more modern compositions. The score fits the film perfectly.The pacing is quite slow,, specially if compared to recent films, even in the 1970â€²s it was considered slow paced, however. But the pacing is relative because the film takes its time and the slower pacing doesn't hurt the experience of seeing the film, it improves it.",10,2,4,29 September 2012
21 Jump Street," Solid entertainment
","21 jump street is solid entertainment all through. In fact, one of the most entertaining movies of this year. It has a good deal of solid comedy. Nothing more that you might hope for such type of movie. It is not art and doesn't try to be. It is a solid and entertaining movie a very good way to kill time. Though I wouldn't recommend this film very highly for hardcore film buffs, instead, watch some Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Takahata and Kubrick, before watching second rate stuff like this.It is good entertainment but I wondered whether my time was well spend or not in watching stuff like this.",7,1,2,27 December 2012
The Godfather: Part II," Just give Coppola the Nobel Prize!
","Millions of people worldwide suffer from insomnia, that is difficulty in sleeping. However, Coppola, the genius filmmaker who brought us Apocalypse Now and The Godfather has utilized his mastery of the human psychology to also brought us the definitive cure for insomnia: The Godfather 2. This is a film specially designed to adjust to the human brainwaves in such a way to induce in a profound sleepiness.Running at the monumental length of 200 minutes, with a convoluted mess of a story, made up of flashbacks, a few strong emotional moments and tons of other very boring moments, with one of the most boring scores ever made (please, that little 'Italian' noise in the background surely is boring!, this film surely has made happy millions of people suffering from insomnia.Coppola has made a masterwork of cinema: instead of using films to provoke emotions he managed to created an audio-visual experience that cuts the brain off and enables it to fall into sleep. Truly a work that deserves the Nobel Prize of Medicine. Bravo Coppola!Highly recommended if you have insomnia!",7,4,11,14 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Quite good
","While the producers decided to cut the film based on the last Harry Potter novel into two parts as to maximize the revenue they could extract from the franchise, which has become the most lucrative film franchise of the last decades, the films that they made based on these two halves were quite good. They certainly weren't great films, unlike the Lord of the Rings, which was a truly great masterpiece of fantasy novel adapted into film. These Harry Potter films were competent but not masterpieces in any way shape of form. There was also the problem of the main actors being a bit too old to portrait teenagers and thus it shows that they had to shave every half an hour and put some makeup over the shade of the beard.",7,1,3,3 January 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best action films ever made
","I think that Terminator 2 is not as good as the first Terminator, which had a better, more structured story, though Terminator 2 has much better special effects, the product of a budget 15 times greater. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time and I can see why: it looks good even 20 years later.Overall, this film is a keeper: certainly one of the best films of its genre and one of my top 100 favorite films (though not top 25, that's why I gave it a 9/10, though the film is pretty much perfect and I perfectly understand why some people consider it one of the top 10 best ever made, though for me its only top 100).I have watched it several times and it is also one of those films that one can watch over and over without getting tired of it.",9,2,2,11 October 2012
Salt," Mediocre action film
","I found this film to be a quite mediocre action flick and I like the concept of action flicks featuring girls kicking the asses of soldiers several times their size. However, in this case it did not work, mainly because the film took itself too seriously.Angelina Jolie apparently is unable to do a good film, which is quite expected from the fact that she isn't a serious actress: her acting abilities aren't top notch and the fact is that she is simply a hot babe that they put in the screen for this reason alone.I would recommend it only to those that like action films, I mean, any action films!",4,3,8,26 October 2012
Duck Soup," Excellent comedy
","This is among the oldest movies that I ever tried to watch. It is indeed a very classic stuff and I noticed that it is a very fast paced movie: I though that movies from 1930 would be very slow paced but this one is anything but that, it is full of very good jokes and fast paced delivery.I also found interesting to note that many of the jokes used in this movie became so iconic that I instantly recognized their use in several other media. The mirror joke, for instance, is perhaps one of the greatest moments of this film and has so great an influence that every comedy series today, such as Family Guy, still uses the same joke. It was truly the work of genius to devise such a joke at the time.",8,2,4,13 January 2013
Apocalypse Now," Indeed a work of art
","Apocalypse Now is Coppola's most artistic work. A film fundamentally about one thing: War is Hell. To send this message this film fully utilizes all the possibilities of cinema: fully exploiting images and sounds in their capacity for generating brain stimuli. This is Coppola's most 'artistic' film and it is a very, very different film from the Godfathers, which are much more traditional drama films. This is not a drama, nor action, nor thriller, nor any genre, though one could call it a War Epic, it is more of an art-house film made with a blockbuster budget, like the German classic, Aguirre, made with a budget 40 times larger.I would place this film as the second greatest war film ever made (after the Japanese masterpiece, Grave of the Fireflies). Though these two are very different films (the second, however, generated a greater emotional response from me, that's why I put it first)",10,1,2,15 October 2012
In the Name of the Father," Very sad and powerful film
","This one is a keeper, it is indeed one of the best films I have ever seem. It is in my top 50 favorite films and I think it will always remain there. Set in the British Islands in the 1970's, this film shows clearly how complicated was the situation of the poorer folks from Ireland relative to the rest of the Islands and how they suffered extreme prejudice from their ethnic background. Which I would think is rather absurd considering that the main way of differentiating an Irishman from an Englishman is the accent.There are some minor flaws in the film, however, but it doesn't detract from the viewing experience.Overall, a very touching film and I highly recommend it.",9,0,0,16 October 2012
The Intouchables," Mediocre comedy
","Its a harmless clichÃ©d ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. EtcÂ… The clichÃ© goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater.",4,32,72,29 September 2012
Spirited Away," Perhaps the best one shot film experience a person can have!
","First I note that one should watch this film subtitled, while the American dub is rather high quality, it simply doesn't approach the quality of the Japanese voice acting in terms of conveying emotions. The same applies to any other language.Take one individual, one screen and 125 minutes. What's the best possible experience this individual could have by looking at the screen for 125 minutes? This is the best. Yep, while I could argue there are films one can get a better long experience by watching them over and over, gradually digesting it, the best 'one shot' film ever made (that I have seem yet, from the thousands of films I have seem) is this.The experience I had watching this film for the first time was never equaled by any other film, I could say that only stuff like Beethoven's 9th Symphony had impressed me to a comparable degree. This is not a simple film, it is an spectacle of colors, sounds (with one of the best film scores ever) and emotions. It possesses an immersive power that I didn't though was possible for a film before watching it. Its sort of like 2001: A Space Odyssey on crack but with much more emotion and characterization. This is truly the best film of the 21st century (while I would put 'There Will be Blood' is in a distant 2nd place).Also, I should note that I had never seem a feature length Japanese animated film before I saw this one. Those that say one needs to 'understand' anime before watching this are clearly wrong. However, its true that this film doesn't match the preferences of everyone, specially those Americans that have had their brains programmed by a lifetime watching only American films to only like the canned products of Hollywood.",10,1,3,7 October 2012
The Usual Suspects," Highly entertaining but not great
","The only thing that was great about this film was the ending the rest was good, but nothing really 'great'. I though it was a bit boring at parts and it did not hold my attention during it whole duration: I had to make an effort to watch it entirely, which is not expected from a film made in the 1990's (if it was a film from before 1977 (which means, before Star Wars changed the film industry), that would be alright: I gave 9/10 for Citizen Kane, but its finale was even better and the whole film had a better felling).I won't say it was a great film: it was entertaining but it is not a work of art and it shouldn't be in the top 250 list. I recommend it to those that like these mobster films, since this is essentially one of those films. I have, however, no preference towards this genre at all.",7,1,2,17 October 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Quite competent but nothing special
","I found this little-long film to be quite entertaining. It is much weaker than the Lord of the Rings trilogy, given that its source material is also weaker. Tolkien began to craft his Middle Earth in the Hobbit novel but from the film I got the impression that the concept of the Middle Earth began as something quite less impressive than what it blossomed later in the Lord of the Rings. Here we have basically an children's adventure story set in a fantasy land full of orcs, goblins and monsters of all kinds.Overall, I found the film entertaining but certainly not on the level of the original Lord of the Rings films. Competently executed but nothing that is a must see.",6,2,13,15 December 2012
The Princess Bride," One of the most solid movies ever made
","Princess Bride is one of the most solid movies ever made: nearly everything about it, except the dated special effects, works very well. It is a memorable, fun movie full of good jokes and should be a movie that works for all age-groups. It is not one of those family movies that are only cool for the children but instead this movie has several layers of complexity and is directed by a rather talented director who also directed Stand By Me, another excellent film.This is one of the must see for film buffs. I wouldn't rate it higher than 8/10 because it lacks that visceral dramatic power that prevents it from attaining true greatness (i.e. like Kurosawa's Ikiru).",8,1,2,12 January 2013
Zulu," Recommended
","This film is pretty much a very well executed battle scene. The film shows, in a rather ironic way, how the 'gallant' British, the ones who 'gave civilization to the African barbarian tribes, in small numbers defended the honor of the civilized world against a massive African barbarian horde that seeks to destroy the British forces and hence the light brought by the British Empire into this forsaken land. But thanks to our gallant soldiers, who killed dozens of barbarians for every man lost, the victory was ours and, hence, it was a victory in the name of civilization and progress.'Yes, it is a very propaganda like film and the fun one has when watching this film is how cartoonish the British soldiers and their African enemies look and act. With their heavy accent and their discipline and their ludicrous red uniforms that don't make any military sense at all, this film is one huge barrel of fun.",7,4,7,8 December 2012
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A very solid comedy
","This was one of the most entertaining comedies that I have seem before I began my film journey a few month ago. Its very entertaining and is also quite violent, but it never takes itself seriously enough for the violence to have any serious meaning at all. Like violence in one of those Simpsons' horror episodes. This film entertains from beginning to finish.However, do not watch this film expecting some great work of art. This is not a great film, just a very entertaining and, yes, creative one. I would say it is better than 90% of the films out there. Though, to enjoy it fully, one must be immersed into the current mainstream North American zeitgeist.",7,1,2,2 November 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," Excellent, but I wasn't as impressed as other people
","This film represents one of the largest Hollywood productions of all time. With a budget of 15 million dollars, or about 100 million dollars converted for inflation, it was one of the largest film productions in history at the time and still represents a film with a larger budget than most modern Hollywood flicks.The main character of the film is complex and one which the American audiences, for which this film was intended, can relate too and the theme of the film is very interesting in itself. It is centered on the process of the construction of an Arab nationality, which the film makes it appear as if Lawrence represented a major part in the process of transition from tribal loyalties to the notion of a pan-Arab loyalty. I note that even today this hasn't fully happened.",9,0,3,6 October 2012
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Best
","This film is a very solid offering from a not so solid director, Spielberg, who made some solid films, such as E.T. and Raiders of the Lost Ark, but never managed to attain greatness, until this film. Easily the best film he ever made, Spielberg showed that he is also able to direct serious stuff besides escapist adventure films. I would put this film among my top 50 favorite films.This film is technically flawless and shows how sophisticated Hollywood filmaking had become by the early 1990's. Though I would question the use of black and white in the film: color is good and the Pianist showed it can be used in a WW2 tragedy film. However, this film is not the best WW2 film ever made either, Grave of the Fireflies, by Isao Takahata, a film detailing the suffering of two children to survive in Japan in the final months of WW2, is easily superior to this one and if you think this film is sad, thy watching Takahata's masterpiece.",9,9,14,16 October 2012
The Incredibles," One of Pixar's best
","The Incredibles was one of Pixar's best films. I didn't find it as good as Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up, but it wasn't as bad as Brave, or as pedestrian as Finding Nemo. It is a very long (for US standards) animated feature at 110 minutes and has much more complexity and character development than the usual animated fare made in the US: this is a family film that adults will like nearly as much as the children (though not 100% as much). It is full of action but nobody appear to die in the film besides the villain: in one scene Mr. Incredible throws a massive metal thing over some guards and they are only disabled. It is a James Bond and superhero spoof, a very well executed one.",8,3,4,13 January 2013
The Elephant Man," Excellent drama
","An excellent movie, though not exactly my taste in movies, it is unforgettable and a pretty strong movie. It's basically a movie about human suffering and how an individual can be completely excluded from society merely because of his/her physical appearance.It tells the factual story of Joseph Merrick, a man born Victorian Britain that began developing physical deformities when he was about five years old. By his late teens, his physical deformities prevented him from working as a factory laborer and instead he had to make out a living by selling himself as a curiosity. By the later years of his life he moved to a hospital and died there, at the age of 27. The movie begins by showing how terrible was Merrick's job as a living curiosity and proceeds to show how he moved to a hospital, which became his last place of residence.One can be deeply moved by Merrick's terrible life experiences in late 19th century Britain and France. Despite being a bit clichÃ© driven, I would recommend this movie for everyone which is not very weak of heart, however, as this movie is heartbreaking.",9,1,3,29 September 2012
Kick-Ass," One of the best superhero films?
","Partially, yes, it is among the best of the bunch. Though not on the level of Spider Man 2, The Dark Knight and Watchmen, it is definitely watchable and it is very funny, though it is not a masterpiece (in fact, there isn't any true masterpiece in terms of superhero movies: the greatest would be, perhaps, Watchmen, in terms of having a powerful impact over the individual who watches it).The best parts of the film are the first two thirds, while the climax and the ending are a bit flawed and, as a result, the film loses steam and becomes weaker, I would have rated it 8 or even 9 if the momentum had been maintained until the end.",8,0,4,8 January 2013
NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind," A Masterpiece
","* Edit: This film should be viewed in Japanese, the dubbed voice acting is terrible, period.Nausicaa is a post-apocalyptic sci fi/fantasy animated film. It's perhaps the ultimate nerd movie: a whole new world is created from Miyazaki's unbounded imagination, involving massive post-apocalyptic wastelands and the remains of civilization trying to survive in these environments. That's what I like! The film was based on the first two volumes of a seven volume epic manga series and simplifies much of the original story to fit the movie. However, since the author of the manga and the movie was the same (Miyazaki) there isn't any direct contradiction and the manga nerds cannot complain: it's like if the Lord of the Rings movies were directed and written by Tolkien.In a sense, it's like an improved Star Wars, but without any of the stereotypical villains. The music, by Joe Hisaishi, while not as complex as the music he made for Miyazaki's later films, is still great and matches the atmosphere of the film perfectly. The only film score that has given my goosebumps are Hisaishi compositions, indeed, they are a major differential between Miyazaki's films and the rest of cinema, and a major factor of why I rate Miyazaki's films above the rest of cinema. The backgrounds and the designs are also breathtaking and while the quality of the animation is not on Akira's level (in this film less than 60,000 cells were used, compared to 160,000 cells for Akira) the much more compelling story of the film more than compensates for this weakness.Overall, this film is nearly flawless, with only a couple of problems involving its low budget which crippled the ending. Still not enough for me to remove any points from a perfect score. One of the greatest films ever made and is one of the ultimate examples of the experiences that can be provided by cinema.Edit: Upon fourth viewing I think that I would upgrade my impression of this film from 'one of the greatest ever' to 'probably the greatest film ever made'. Why? A great film must be about a great subject and this film is fundamentally about the importance of people (and creatures) respecting each other as they respect themselves. Set in a world destroyed by war, (spoilers alert!) the film opens with last remains of mankind fighting each other and being slowly destroyed by Earths self defense mechanisms and ends with peace among man and between man and Earth. The main character, Nausicaa is an heroine of mythical proportions, a character that is very much like Jesus, in both her degree of compassion and her story through the film, as she suffers from death (her sacrifice to save her people) and resurrection though the film.",10,1,2,29 September 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Nothing to care about
","This film did not induce into any deep emotions in me. It was an interesting film, but nothing great and people shouldn't be all 'oh my god, this is amazing', oh, the concept is very good but the execution is nothing special and nothing that we haven't seem a hundred times in other films. The fact is that this is one of those mass produced canned Hollywood biographical feature films that are exactly alike each other, with some very minor variation in concept.So, here we have, another Hollywood biography based on the same mold as millions of others. This time, however, the protagonist got younger with the passing of time! Ohhh.... Nothing special here. Sorry.",7,2,3,21 October 2012
Mulholland Drive," Even better than Dune
","I have seem two Lynch films: This and Dune. Well, this one is better than Dune ( :) ). The best part of this film is Naomi Watts and this is her's best film to date, partially because this is the film where we can see more of her 'acting' talents than anywhere else. : ) This film doesn't have a plot, it doesn't have anything besides a complex set of scenes designed to induce emotions, both of the higher and lower (i.e. under the waist :) ) emotions.I perfectly understand why film critics considered/voted this film to be the best of the decade: it is simply very innovative and has what the sex starved film critics need as well: a very substantial quantity of eroticism permeates the whole film. Sometimes the film feels like a porno with good acting, something truly visionary.",9,5,9,20 October 2012
Grave of the Fireflies," The Greatest War Movie Ever Made, Period!
","* Edit: One has to watch this film in Japanese. The voice acting is infinitely superior. Please, do not watch this in English (or any other language) it would offend this film!This film is truly something entirely different from what one expects from cinema. Roger Ebert once said that this film is 'an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation', however I might add, it forces a rethinking of cinema, since I cannot think of any other film that approaches this film in terms of raw emotion.Incredibly powerful and emotionally draining, this film makes any other drama look like an Adam Sandler film. Take other war films, such as Schindler's list or Full Metal Jacket, these films are great and moving, but they simply do not operate at the same level of excellence as this one does. Best war movie ever made, by far. Watch it now if you can.",10,1,2,5 October 2012
Brave," Mediocre Pixar
","In the past Pixar has pushed the envelope in US animation, making more adult films than those of Disney and other studios. Thanks to their Ghibli inspiration, they managed to attain levels of artistic excellence lacking in other US animation studios. However, this cartoon is an exception: out of the Pixar films I have watched (including all their 1995-2012 films except Cars, 1 and 2), this was the weakest. Indeed, this is a quite weak film that will only please small children.It is also shorter than most Pixar films, at 80 minutes of actual film, short because children will not manage to watch longer films. Indeed, this is completely pedestrian and mediocre film that recycles all the tropes from previous Disney and Pixar films and packages them in a more beautiful CGI look than ever before.",5,3,6,13 January 2013
The Hangover Part II," Much weaker than the original
","A general rule of thumb regarding films is that sequels tend to be much worse than the originals. Serious film directors such as Stanley Kubrick, for example, would never do sequels: it doesn't make any artistic sense to make sequels. Instead one should make other films.This film is pretty much a repeat of the first but worse in all aspects: the execution suffered and the director was only trying to repeat what was already done in the first time. Therefore this is an abysmal failure of a film: it is better to watch the first twice than watch the first and then this one. Though it is not that bad if you never saw the first, which is superior in every way.",5,1,2,3 January 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the 40 best films ever made
","The United States has produced about 40,000 full length feature films released to the market. This one belongs to the top 0.1% in terms of quality. It is certainly one of the best films ever made, if one is able to experience it adequately.It competes with The Empire Strikes Back to the throne of science fiction, though they are two very different films. This one is simpler in terms of plot, but more complex in artistic terms. This film is perhaps the most ambitious ever made (though the Tree of Life is also very ambitious, the difference is that this film manages to attain its objectives, while the Tree of Life fails to engage the watcher adequately).What's this film purpose? It is to show mankind's evolution from apes to a new type of being. Also, the film shows that mankind's intelligence appears to have been created by another species and that mankind has itself developed a new intelligent species: Hal 9000. So its a film about intelligence creating intelligence.Another good touch is the extensive use of 18th century classical music and 18th century architecture at the 'alien hotel' in the end of the film, since the 18th century was the beginning of mankind's exponential economic and technological development that is (apparently) poised to lead it to the stars.(spoilers alert)Some commentary on the story of the film:Also, the only well developed character of the film is not a human, it's Hal 9000, and he/she/it is a very interesting character, fearing the mission's strange characteristics, Hal invents a malfunction with the ship in order to psychologically signalize his/hers/its stress to the rest of the crew, however the rest of the crew fails to understand poor Hal and instead they decide to kill him, Hal reacts in the same way people would: he decides to save his/her/its life by killing the rest of the crew.{end spoilers alert)Overall, one of the best films ever: 10/10, though not as good as some films I know. I saw a Japanese Anime film, Princess Mononoke, in the same day, and it blew it off the water.",10,0,2,12 October 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Very good, despite its antiquity
","I enjoyed this film. Its very lighthearted and fun, providing 100 minutes of non-stop entertainment. The film also surpassed my expectations, because I generally do not like old films and comedies. But this one keep me entertained during it's whole run.The film's plot takes place during the transition from silent films to talking pictures, the protagonist is a successful Hollywood actor who meets an upstart. Later the two fall in love, in a traditional clichÃƒÂ©. However, the film is not locked in the plot, which instead serves only as a scaffold to place the many spectacular musical pieces of the film. So the lack of originality and complexity in the plot or in terms of the main characters do not hurt the film as much as it could.Overall, I would say that this musical is highly enjoyable for all audiences despite the fact it is a 60 year old film. It held well with time, differently from Casablanca, for instance, which I found rather mediocre.",8,0,2,29 September 2012
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A really solid drama but not a masterpiece
","This is a neat very competently made film about relationships in our post- modern age. The fact that is employs a science fiction concept (erasing memories) doesn't detract from its true genre: drama. Interestingly, that Jim Carrey's best films were his two dramas, this and The Truman Show (also based on a science fiction concept of an artificial city of actors that created an artificial life for the one non-actor in the city, Carrey). That's fundamentally because comedies lack the dramatic firepower and affecting depth that can be reached by drama. Overall, this is a really solid and well executed drama with a small touch of experimental elements but it is not as remotely as sophisticated as, let's say, Tarkovsky film's.",8,0,1,8 December 2012
Taken," One of the best recent action films
","First I should note that my scoring system is very rigorous: only excellent films manage to register an 8/10, 95% of films register lower scores.This film represents everything that is good about actions films. It is a well executed action thriller without many noticeable flaws. In fact, it is perhaps one of the best action film of the last 5 years, only the Bourne films were as good as this one. A film of pure energy and aggression.Interestingly, this film marked the change of career for Liam Neeson, who once did serious dramas and now makes action movies, at the age of 60! He was 56 when he did this film and he still looked quite young, thanks to modern makeup techniques.",8,0,1,25 October 2012
Avatar," Entertaining but nothing else
","I had higher expectations from this film, being a great fan of James Cameron's previous work, such as The Terminator and Aliens (his two best films, in my honest opinion), but this film simply disappointing. It is pretty much a vessel for testing special effects and is perhaps Cameron's worst film after Piranha 2, that's it, it is Cameron's worst proper film.The main problem of this film is simply that it is to dumb: it has the plot of a Saturday morning cartoon and the characters lack any depth. So Cameron simply recycled the plot that was already used a hundred times before to test drive these new special effects. In essence, this film's only strength is its visual spectacle, which is amazing and that's why I gave it 6 points, otherwise it is just a boring dumb film.",6,4,7,17 October 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," Good for what it is, but certainly not top 250 material
","Better than most Pixar's films and perhaps the best film that Dreamworks ever made, it is a high quality family entertainment that sometimes has the feeling of a video game and other times uses common plot clichÃ©s to advance the story. To small kids unfamiliar with older films this picture would appear excellent but to someone expecting some innovative creativity this film fails. It is a very well executed clichÃ© film. Very good for kids and parents who don't know much about films.For something truly extraordinary in terms of family oriented animation, well, watch My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service.But it doesn't work very well for someone who has more experience watching films. Feels similar to the 2012 Batman film (Dark Knight Rises) in these terms.",7,1,3,17 November 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," Another excellent Kubrick film
","I am finishing watching all Kubrick films. Now I have only to go for The Killing and Lolita do finish viewing all his 'proper' films. This is indeed a among the best films of 1999 (which was a year of several good films), and the 7.2 rating on the IMDb is very low considering the high quality of this film. Though it is certainly not Kubrick's at his best (that was with perhaps 3-4 films, such as 2001, Dr. Strangelove and Barry Lyndon), but it is still above most films released in the 1990's.This film is very powerful and features several characteristics of Kubrick's films, such as the fact that it is slow moving, artistically accomplished and still entertaining. Kubrick is one of the very few directors that attained artistic greatness combined with entertainment value.",9,4,7,13 November 2012
Departures," That's how one should make films
","The Japanese cinema is perhaps the world's best, specially in the medium of animation, where they lack anything resembling an equal given that only in Japan we have a truly mature animation industry. And in terms of live action films Japan is also a first rate power. Indeed, since the days of Kurosawa and Ozu, Japan has been showing to the world how to make films.And this film is indeed one of those that shows the dramatic depth of Japanese cinema. Hollywood is still a long way from crafting drama of the same caliber, perhaps because the American zeitgeist which is characterized by a life of plenty for most Americans reduced the capacity of Americans to experience drama and thus affected negatively the film industry. Japan was a country that underwent much greater suffering and whose culture is characterized by a mentality shaped by these constraints which resulted into a more strong willed population and thus cinema with greater dramatic impact.Rated: 8.5/10",8,0,0,8 December 2012
In Time," A retarded film but it looks good
","One of the two main problem of this film is the marxist excrement that resides within its veins. The fact is that the main factor that drives the plot makes no sense at all: people are able to be healthy and young forever, however, society has developed in such a way to make people die due to the fact that 'people must die' and the film also assumes that 'many must die for a few to live forever', why? It makes no sense at all. Healthy people that don't age would make the world economically much richer than anything we could imagine: that would essentially mean that the near totality of the population would be in the labor force, therefore maximizing per capita economic output. Also, economists understand that there is no such thing as a problem of overpopulation.The other main problem of this film is the fact that Justin Timberlake doesn't know how to act. He is just terrible. And that also helps to ruin the whole film.Overall, the high quality of the visuals made it a bearable film, but the plot and execution (specially relative to Timberlake's acting) were really bad.",2,1,2,22 October 2012
Castle in the Sky," Even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark
","This is it people: the best adventure film ever made. The film combines all the good qualities of the Indiana Jones films with greater dramatic deepness, a vastly superior soundtrack, composed by Joe Hisaishi, for me the best film composer ever and a more complex story than the simplistic stories of the Indy films (though, by no means, it is a very complex film). While the main characters are 12-year old kids, one could argued that this film is indeed more adult than the Indy films, as it is handled on a more serious tone and has also a serious underlying message, though not as remotely as serious as Nausicaa.The film also has a massive amount of 'cool stuff', such as the technological marvels shown and the incredible quality of the action sequences.",10,2,2,3 October 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," A very good family film
","Okay, I had never seem this film until now. Well, how good is it? It is a very simple film that has a very emotionally powerful story. However, I cannot give this film a perfect 10/10 simply because of its numerous technical flaws and its simplicity means that it doesn't hold up to numerous viewings. Also, there is the fact that I had seem this story told a multiple times before in a myriad of other films and TV programs made the experience of seeing for the first time what I had already seem a million times a quite boring experience.So, given all these facts, I would say that this well constructed and acted drama film deserves a high score, thanks to its cultural influence and its high quality. But it did not impress me, due to its already iconic status.",8,1,3,4 November 2012
Psycho," Excellent psychological thriller
","That's my current favorite Hitchcock film. Its more of a terror film than a psychological thriller and this is the reason I like it: its the only Hitchcock film that has really managed to scare me. However, I do not consider a film such as this as 'a great film', simply because I am not the greatest fan of such type of genre. Still, I admit it is a masterpiece of its genre and the fans of such films will certainly love this movie.Also, given it is a very old film, it has some flaws given its obsolete pacing and structure. The story drags a little in the first half of the film and later it seems to be rushed through. Though in a sense this improves the final dramatic shock of the film. The ending is totally 'holy sh*t this is great!', though I took off two points out of 10 because of its incomplete nature as a film.",8,0,0,2 October 2012
There Will Be Blood," Perhaps the best American film of the 21st century
","If I could resume this flick in one phrase it would be: 'This film is a flawless masterpiece about a ruthless entrepreneur who suffers from severe mental problems of an unspecified nature (he is, basically, a sociopath).'The main character, Daniel Plainview, is the most powerful film character of the 21st century, given all the 21st century films that I have ever seem as of October 2012. He is aggressive, terrifying but at the same time, psychologically very weak: he has a very delicate mental balance as little things can really put him off balance and make him announce death threats to anyone in the room.The film is not only about sociopathy, however, it is also about entrepreneurship, in both the oil and church sectors of 'the economy'. Daniel's archenemy in the film, Eli Sunday, is also another entrepreneur who is nearly as aggressive as our protagonist and he would be the most powerful character of any lesser film, but here, Eli is almost an ant next to Daniel Plainview.Overall, a film to those that like powerful dramas, but those weak of heart should stay away from this monstrous film.",10,2,4,13 October 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," Just a great film
","I found it a very powerful film. Interestingly, film critics like Ebert appear to not like this film that much. Indeed, its simplicity does not bode well for film critics.Cute kiddies are always a good bonus as well. A story told through their eyes becomes more powerful as it contrasts the aggression of the adults with the innocence of the children and the impact of the unjust prosecution of the 'negro' on the lives of the children at school and home.Overall, very enjoyable film, though a bit simple at times. Has an epic speech in the end as well. That surely added a point to my vote.I will have to include it as one of my top 100 favorite films.",8,0,0,11 October 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Slightly Disappointing
","Considering that it was rated as one of the best films ever made in the IMDb I was expecting more from this film. To me it was a very good film but not a great one. Just a very good one: I will never see this film again, its good for one sitting, but nothing more. Though this experience though me one thing: the IMDb ratings are highly imperfect, which is expected from someone with more experience but I watched this film a few years ago, before I became more of a 'film buff' and at the time I though that the average user ratings were a very good way of Its plot is not the best ever as I wouldn't be exactly fully engaged with the characters. The ending was also unsatisfying. Overall, a very good, but not great film. Just the type of film that usually wins the academy awards.",8,0,3,4 November 2012
The Wrestler," A powerful drama
","While I wouldn't classify the Wrestler as a masterpiece it is still a very strong film: It was one of the best films of 2008 and features a performance for the ages by Mickey Rourke, who plays an aging wrestler trying to deal with the problems in his life, mostly decorrent from his decadence in the sport. He has severe problems in terms of relationships with those he loves and is unable to function properly as a normal father to his daughter, as he cannot honor a commitment to show up at a certain time and place to his daughter. He almost broke my heart during the film as it shows a broken human being in a very realistic manner.",8,1,1,3 January 2013
WALLÂ·E," Best feature lenght animated film ever made outside Japan
","However, it is not among the top 10 best animated films ever made: The Japanese director Miyazaki alone has directed 9 films better than this one (watch: Nausicaa, Laputa, Totoro, Kiki, Porco Rosso, Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Ponyo).Overall, this film is certainly the best animated film made in the US and is also better than any animated film made in Europe (which I have seem, though Chomet's work, such as The Triples of Belleville and The Illusionist seem tough contenders relative to Wall-E), it is also one of my top 200 favorite films, ... however, ... People here show that they are rather ignorant of the Japanese tradition of animated films. Claiming this to be the best animated film of all time is like claiming that some European film is the best film of all time without seeing any American or Japanesre film: the simple fact is that Japan dominates animation to a greater degree that the US dominates live action films. Therefore, one should educate himself or herself before claiming that this film is the 'best ever made', without even having the knowledge of films made outside his/her own country! That's simple stupid national chauvinism of the greatest degree.The United States lacks animated cinema. Watch the work of Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Hayao Miyazaki (already mentioned), Isao Takahata and others to understand what animation can really do. The fact is that Wall-E lacks the complexity and depth of the top of the line of animation.",8,0,2,24 October 2012
Prometheus," Good but not great
","Prometheus is a very good science fiction film and is basically Alien 5. There is a new Ripley, a new Bishop and a new set of greedy characters from Weyland corporation. The special effects are gorgeous, and the ship designs are very interesting. Though, the film is still flawed and is not of the same degree of quality attained in the first two Aliens films. Though, overall, it is one of the best recent science fiction films, given that there hasn't been a classic in the genre since the 1990â€²s.This film begins in pre-historical times when an unknown being dies from drinking some strange fluid. The film then goes to the 21st century and shows that cave drawings showing Aliens and stars have been discovered by archaeologists. The movie later shows that these drawings were enough to . By the late 21st century technology has progressed enough to allow us to send and expedition to the planetoid body that the ancient cave drawings refereed to.The movie plays out like and adventure and is a very interesting. Though it leaves a lot of unanswered questions, reserved for the sequels. Recommended for science fiction fans.",7,0,3,29 September 2012
Paths of Glory," Excellent war film
","Paths of Glory is a Stanley Kubrick film with all his trademark characteristics. Set in WW1 when a commander orders his artillery to fire on his own men to force them to attack enemy positions, the film follows the judgment of the three men (which were randomly chosen from the regiment) charged with cowardliness from not following the order to attack.The film shows all of the classical Stanley Kubrick's tropes: a cynical view of the human condition, a highly negative view of war and of its dehumanizing effects over the men involved in it. This film, however, is not perfect and shows the limitations of making cinema in the 1950â€²s. Still, it is considered by many as Kubric's first great film, though I haven't yet watched his earlier films. I would say that all Kubric films that I have watched, which are Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odissey, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, are all round excellent and all deserve praise.One thing that I have noticed is that I like Kubrics films more than other old films (I consider a film old if it was made before Star Wars).",10,0,1,29 September 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Good, but nothing really great
","Nolan is the world's most overrated filmmaker, he is good, but not that good! I mean, rated over Kubrick on IMDb? Please. That's expected: to attract the mediocre masses one has to produce a mediocre cultural product. Anyway, this film is highly entertaining but it is nothing really special: just your conventional plot of an action film: some villain got a bomb to explode Manhattan, your hero needs to stop him, he does and that's it. He does stuff in between, to fill the two hours, and here we also have the extensive use of well executed clichÃ©s that will appeal to those with less film viewning experience. For example, (spoilers!) Catwoman shows up in the end, after doing the Han Solo thing of saying: 'I am out because I only care about my ass' and coming back to redeem the character. These sorts of action clichÃ©s permeate the film and hold it back a little for someone which has more experience watching films. But 13-year old kids will think this is the greatest film ever made.",7,2,5,20 October 2012
Toy Story 3," Good, but nothing really special
","I have noticed that Pixar's films have amassed legions of fans, even though they are supremely mediocre. Maybe that's why they are so popular: mass appeal means mediocrity. The best stuff is generally not the stuff that appeals to everyone, to appeal to everyone is to make something that everyone enjoys and understands, but given that people are different, it means that you must make something that doesn't impress an individual as much as it could, as to impress the greatest number of people.Take this film for instance, it is a decent film, it entertains, but it is not a masterpiece by any means and is full of flaws: This film is filled with clichÃ©s and forced emotions (melodrama). These flaws are typical of Hollywood blockbusters and they reinforce the mediocrity of the film. Though, the film manages to execute these clichÃ©s well enough to be a good film, but expect nothing special.",6,1,5,5 October 2012
AmÃ©lie," Excellent all around film about the little things in life
","This film is one of my top 10 films of the 21st century: I gave it a 9/10 because I tend to be very rigorous with my scoring system: I gave Seven Samurai an 8/10, for instance, and 9/10 for Citizen Kane. I would only give 10/10 for a film that does at least one of the two following effects:1 - Makes me cry happy tears. 2 - Makes me fell like: Holy sh*t! That's greatness!It is told in an original style and it is very different from conventional Hollywood films. The film develops more realistic characters, that have greater complexity than the usual Hollywood fare. It doesn't follow any clichÃ©s and is a very creative light dramatic adventure.",8,1,4,3 October 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Quite good
","Some of the kiddies here were quite impressed by this film. Indeed, it is among the best of the series, but it is not a masterpiece of cinema. It is a competent adaptation of the novels into film. In fact, the last book was transformed into two films to milk the franchise as much as possible which therefore reduce the artistic accomplishments of these films.However, abstracting away from such issues and watching this film as a film it is very good. It is flawed in parts but in other ways it is very good and sometimes even powerful if you are invested into the characters from watching the previous films or reading the novels.However, doesn't watch this if you haven't watched the previous films or read the novels. It doesn't make sense that way.",7,0,1,3 January 2013
Rear Window," Excellent, much better than 90% of the films made today
","One of the best films by Hitchcock. While I did not love Vertigo and The Birds, this one was exceptional: in contrast to other old films (I define a film as old when it was made before 1977 (Star Wars), since films before that date were slow and 'boring' while films made after that date tend to be faster and more visceral), it is a quite driving film with a well constructed plot and the director handles very well the overall tension and payoff. It is also more light-handed than later films by the director, such as the quite scary Psycho. But I found it to be hugely entertaining and I am well prepared to see it again, its much better than 90% of the films made today.",8,1,3,22 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Obligatory!
","There are two basic types of great films: films that critics love (Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey) and films that the public loves and the critics do not love that much, such as Star Wars and Gladiator. Usually, the films that the public loves are better in fact: critics pretend to like different things to make themselves 'superior'. But the fact is that Star Wars is simply pure entertainment and anyone who denies its greatness is pretty much being pretentious and dishonest.But this film Not as good as Empire Strikes Back, though still excellent. I would recommend Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke, both by Miyazaki, for those that liked this film.",10,0,0,12 October 2012
Ran," Currently my Kurosawa favorite
","I have seem, at this point of time:1 - Rashomon 2 - Seven Samurai 3 - Yiojimbo 4 - Kagemusha 5 - RanThe earlier Kurosawa films were very interesting, however, they lacked a certain 'budget thingie'. With material limitations I think Kurosawa was unable to fully realize his vision while here we have all cylinders firing as this was the most expensive film in Japanese history up to that point (converted to current dollars, it cost 30 million, a huge amount for the standards of the day!).This film has it all: massive battles, treachery, love, complex and interesting characters and can be understood fundamentally as a film about old age and its effects on the reduction of decision making capabilities of individual decision makers (that's sounded terrible, didn't it? :) ).So concluding this is the best film out of those five, that I have seem from Kurosawa. Highly recommended. I gave it only 9/10 to differentiate from the truly 'best' films ever.",10,1,3,17 October 2012
Cube," Very interesting film
","I first should note that I am quite rigorous in my rating system: 7/10 means that the film is very good, though not a masterpiece. I found this particular film to be highly entertaining, but not the timeless masterpiece that some people might think it is. Its a highly entertaining psychological thriller set in a maze. It provides a good afternoon experience.Also, this film suffers from dated special effects: computed generated images from 1997 look terrible compared to modern film, which severely detracts from the film's experience. This type of problem doesn't plague animated films or films that use other forms of special effects, such as 2001 and its models.",7,0,1,5 October 2012
Easy A," I liked this film
","This is a rather interesting highschool film. There are very few interesting American films about highschool, though the Japanese made superb films such as Whisper of the Heart, about highschool life. This is certainly not remotely as good as that drama masterpiece, though it shouldn't be compared to it. However, it is certainly one of the best of its genre: the 'American Teen Movie' genre. The interactions between the characters look remarkably realistic, considering that it is a film operating under the traditional rules of Hollywood film-making. Not as realistic as some other films, though, such as the aforementioned Whisper of the Heart, but still remarkably realistic.I would highly recommend this for someone who likes to remember how highschool life was. Though it is far from being a great film.",7,0,0,25 October 2012
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very funny
","I would say that this is one of the most amusing films ever made. It is truly a very entertaining experience, the sheer amount of jokes delivered in this film in pretty much unmatched, I would say. Essentially, this consists of a barrage of very intelligent jokes, trowed one after another. Monty Python's later film, Life of Brian, can be considered superior as a film, but in terms of raw entertainment value, I would rank this as their best.Highly recommended comedy, one of the best there is, in fact. I should also note that I am very rigorous on my rating system: 8/10 is a very strong score in my book. Here's my scoring system:10 - Masterpiece 9 - Superb 8 - Excellent 7 - Very good 6 - Good 5 - MediocreSo, this film is excellent, but it doesn't achieve true greatness, unlike their later film, Life of Brian.",8,0,1,27 October 2012
Moon," An excellent sci fi film
","Moon is a film that some have claimed to copycat the two 'greatest' sci fi films: Blade Runner and 2001. In the sense that the film has artificial persons and artificial intelligence, which are two of the defining characteristics of Blade Runner and 2001, respectively. However, I do not care if the basic ideas are stolen, what matters is that it is a good film and this film is a cut above the rest. Every fan of sci fi films should watch this.Note that I am very rigorous with my scoring system, which means that 7/10 means that the film is an excellent one. I only give films near perfect scores if they are amazingly good and 10/10 is reserved only for films of the caliber of 2001 or Star Wars.",8,2,9,5 October 2012
Gladiator," One of the best historical epics
","While more 'serious' film buffs and film critics don't like Gladiator very much, I, as an history buff, have special interest in ancient Roman history. It is perfectly true that Rome didn't became a republic in 182 AD, and this film can be understood more as an exercise of alternate history. Though is suffers from anachronisms, in terms of dialogue and history: Marcus Aurelius says that he expanded the empire, while in truth he didn't expand it, he only maintained the borders against the pressure from migrating Germanic tribes.Another problem is the fact that Rome never had grain reserves maintained by the State, or at least didn't have according to the historical evidence, and a line o dialogue says: 'he is selling our future' when the emperor sells the grain reserves, such anachronisms plague the film and are an important flaw but I don't think that they merit the removal of a full point of the film's score. The dialogue and the characters are not the most complex ever but are executed well enough and this is enough. Excessive complexity and pretension can kill a film.Overall, I highly recommend this film to those people that love films but don't have any great pretension. More more artsy types shouldn't see it. For the benefit of both the public that liked it and themselves.",10,1,5,2 January 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Terrible commercial film
","Well? What can I say? That's a pretty awful film, though I still found it more tolerable than Tree of Life. Here at least we got some explosions and giant robots fighting (though I couldn't make much sense of it). There is no plot, however, or at least something resembling a plot: There are some robots that turn into cars and stuff and they fight and stuff and then, suddenly the film ends. The acting is terrible as well, which is expected, specially considering that the new pretty girlfriend of the main character was performed by a model and not a professional actress.Michael Bay certainly is one of the most financially successful directors in Hollywood, being the best paid director in 2010, earning over 100 million dollars. However, it remains a mystery of how these transformers films have made nearly one billion dollars in box office. While the general public doesn't generally has the most refined taste for films, I still think that generally films that are successful in the box office tend to be decent. That was not the case here.",3,3,10,29 September 2012
Back to the Future," Great!
","There are though films, that you need to force yourself to pay attention to, before the payoff (the ultimate example being Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev) and there are films that you can simply enjoy effortlessly, such as Back to the Future, one of the best films ever made! Yes, that's right, it surely belongs to the top 100 best films ever, perhaps top 30. I would rank it as among the top 5 comedies ever made and among the top 10 science fiction films ever made as well!Why? It is so freaking good! The 1980's were indeed the peak of pop culture: films and music only got better and better until they peaked in the mid 1980's and this is the peak right now: the coolest film ever made. It is way better than Raider of the Lost Ark in delivering fun!",9,12,15,15 October 2012
Goodfellas," One of the Worst Films Ever Made
","Whats the best film by Martin Scorsese? Taxi Driver all the way.Okay, I will disagree with the popular and critic opinion that this is one of the best films ever, in fact, this is one of the worst films ever made. Why? Well, the acting is superb, the structure is superb as well, the cinematography is superb. In a technical sense, Goodfellas is one of the most well constructed and articulated films ever made. It truly grabs you by the neck and takes you on to a journey you will never forget.And that;'s why it is one of the worst films ever made: it is easy to make a pathetically bad film, such as 'Dude Where is My Car?', it is not easy to make a film that makes you hate the entire cast of characters. The fact is that each one of the characters in this film is terrible: Tommy DeVito is among the most pathetic characters ever made: a guy who kills people due to his own insecurity. I wanted to see him suffer, but the film never let him suffer, that made me anxious!This is a great film, but not great in the good sense, its great in the bad sense. Hence, one of the worst film experiences I ever had.",7,3,16,11 October 2012
The Birds," Entertaining psychological thriller
","While I found Hitchcock's films to be entertaining I wouldn't say that he is the master filmmaker that some claim him to be. He produced dozens of entertaining films, designed to turn on the reptile parts of the human brain, but nothing that I could call a work of art.Here we have a typical case. A film about birds turning against humanity. The film relies on engaging the most primitive emotion of fear from the audience. Similar to modern blockbuster but without relying on special effects, instead focusing on more psychological methods of fear inducement.Overall, a good film but nothing that I could call great or even excellent.",6,1,6,2 October 2012
Princess Mononoke," Holy sh*t!
","*Note: for fully imersing oneself in this film one has to watch it in Japanese. Do not watch in English unless you want to watch with with kids under the age of 10 (well, when I was 10 I was already watching everything subtitled, people should not be afraid of subtitles).The most powerful experience I ever had watching anything (be either a film, a TV series, theater or a show) was the second time that I watched this film. The first time I didn't really give respect this film deserves (I though it was a childish cartoon and I watching it for a guilty pleasure) and actually failed to really get it. After watching several other movies I remembered this film and I noticed it was truly better than anything else I had watched lately, so I decided to watch it again, this time really paying attention to it: The first few minutes were already better than the last five films I had watched put together. When it ended I cried and was unable to sleep for 5-6 hours, thinking about how freaking awesome this film was.This film features the most powerful score ever. I would call it truly a heavy score, like Black Sabbath, but more epic and without distortion. Most film scores are just background noise that serves to convey emotion, but here the score has a life of its own. Indeed, the score alone makes this film better than 90% of all other movies.Edit: Today a viewed this film for the third time. It became BETTER than the second time. I also viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey for the third time in the same day, and this film totally destroyed 2001 and I consider 2001 one of the best films ever made, but this film made it look like an episode of Family Guy by comparison.",10,1,2,6 October 2012
The Godfather," Way overrated, perhaps one of the most overrated films of all time
","I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those 'american' cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one.",9,6,30,13 October 2012
