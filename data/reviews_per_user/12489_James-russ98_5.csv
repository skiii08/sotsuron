First Man," 40 minutes too long
",I'm not quite sure what all the amazing reviews are about. The film consisted of Ryan Gosling staring motionless in the distance and prolonged silences. This film could've been cut down by about 40 minutes. It just didn't work in my opinion. You know it's not good when they finally land on the moon and the only thought running through your head is 'hurry up and get home so this movie can just end already'.,4,2,4,1 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Great Orgin which has hyped me up even more
","This film is awesome, its not the best Marvel film but it certainly isn't the worst. Its really enjoyable l, visibly stunning l, and sets us up nicely for End Game. Let's face it a lot of people who are disliking this film are only doing so because cant hack the thought of a woman being the most powerful superhero lol.",8,4,10,8 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," The Legend Lives On
","As someone who's grown being told of the classic band called Queen and hears the odd song on the radio, I've gone into this film interested about how they formed and obviously, mainly about Freddie Mercury.I can honestly say this movie was brilliant, from the incredible acting to unbelievably brilliant recreation of the famous Live Aid performance.This movie made me feel like I grew up listening to Queen and actually made me feel for Freddie and his troubles.After watching this I've re watched the actual Live Aid performance and a few Queen songs have made on to my Spotify playlist. So coming from someone who isn't a hard-core Queen fan to everyone, you'll love this movie.",8,1,3,1 November 2018
Gone Girl," Massively Overrated
","I went into this film with very high expectations, from the outstanding reviews to the countless times it's been recommended. What a let down. The film doesn't really give the viewer any satisfaction at all. It's unrealistic and at the end you're sat there thinking, what was the point in this movie. The only positives was the fact the acting was brilliant.At least I can tick it off my movie to watch list.",3,2,4,5 November 2018
Halloween," Aged badly and that's the beauty of it
","Just watched this film for the first time in preparation for the new and upcoming Halloween. I can honestly say my eyes were glued to the screen throughout the movie and I can't explain why. The film was a perfect mix of intensity, curiosity and just straight out chilling. When that music plays you'll know what I mean. As the title states, the movie hasn't aged too great but I think that what makes it so brilliant, how in 2018 this film out does the majority made in recent years.Next stop: Halloween II",8,4,5,1 October 2018
