The Benchwarmers," funniest films i've ever seen
","i saw the benchwarmers a couple of days after it was released and i must say it was very funny. it was non stop laughing comedy with some very funny actors, including the guy from Napoleon dynamite, who could make anyone laugh just by himself. along with David spade and rob schneider (of adam sandler movies fame) this trio delivers an ultimate funny blockbuster. i wouldn't be surprised if the three make a couple of more films together. the plot was an original, three losers playing little league baseball, along with the help of a billionaire. the characters were hilarious and they had jokes for about everything, including a spoof on extreme makeover home editions. very very funny.",10,1,3,12 August 2006
The Godfather," A Masterpiece, One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made
","The Godfather had many in awe during its prime, and it still does today. One of the greatest organized crime films ever created, let alone one of the greatest movies ever created, it shows that anything goes as a mobster in the Itlian mafia. Al Pacino became world famous for his role as Micheal Corleon, son of Don Vito Corleon (Marlon Brando), as he prepares to take the family business from his father. As an Italian myself, I can greatly appreciate what this film is trying to do... show what life is really like as a mobster, and what they practically do. Forget the mobster movie flops, or the Sopranos, this movie shows it all. And to follow it up with an even greater sequel is incredible. It's a masterpiece, a must-see by far.",10,1,3,19 August 2006
