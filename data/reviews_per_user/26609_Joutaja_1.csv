Requiem for a Dream," They suffer
","Movie tells about youngs who are addict to drugs. No this is not a new thing. There are lot of movies that tells about this subject but none of them is as good as this one. Style of a director is astonishing. The way he puts emotions in the scenes whit close-up pictures and fast cutting which is bay the way made excellently. Sounds are excellent - specially those during the fast cutting scenes - and music makes the emotional charge of this movie very powerful. Actors - specially Ellen Burstyn - are giving everything they have. They all fit perfectly for their roles and all of them can picture the suffering of a drug addict like their role requires. Burstyn carries out her really hard role work perfectly. Viewer feels sorry for her because she only wanted to lose some weight. Even Marlon Wayans, who is not that good actor, brings out his suffering. I can't believe this is the same guy that was in Dungeons and Dragons. Movie shows what drugs do to us. Relationships brake down, you become sick, you have to do things you don't want to, you run out of money and you always need more drugs and getting loose of them is extremely hard and heavy.",10,1,2,9 March 2003
