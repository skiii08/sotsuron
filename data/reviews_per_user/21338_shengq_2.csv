50 First Dates," Not that great, but still entertaining
","This movie is worthy the bucks I paid for it and it does have the chemistry and some funny parts inside. A very good movie to watch on the special day and my girlfriend and I like that! Enjoy the movie, but don't expect to be a classic.",8,0,0,16 February 2004
Million Dollar Baby," I seen it, I done it, and I will never regret it!
","'Million Dollar Baby' (MDB) is the best movie I have seen in years. Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) played a 31-year old amateur who wants to be a boxing pro and stands on top of the world. She has come from nowhere and always is a nobody in her entire life. The only thing that keep her sticking to her life is her love and passion for boxing. Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) is a veteran coach and cutman in the business who refused to train Maggie in the first place no matter how hard she tried to convince him and persuade him. After all, nobody wants to train a 31-year-old-knows-bearly-nothing-about-boxing woman to be a pro. At that age, many fighters already retire from the ring. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) is a maintenance crew and a retired pro working in the boxing gym and he sees the potential inside Maggie and finally persuaded Frankie to train Maggie to be a monster inside the ring. In spite the fact that Maggie is 32-year old and has only one year training, her career turns out to be a huge success. Nobody can beat or even slow down the girl from a winning streak...Hilary is born for this role and you can tell the strength and perseverance even by her appearance. Yes, she might not grow up in a rich family or get any education, but she has the **HEART** to pursue her dream.Yes, a man with nothing but heart is a meat on the board, but a man definitely cannot succeed if he has no heart of all. This movie is so inspirational and moving and strengthens my belief that you are a walking dead if you have no heart at all.I would give kudos to Hilary, Clint and Morgan for making such a great movie which is obviously underrated on IMDb.Bravo!",10,2,4,29 April 2006
