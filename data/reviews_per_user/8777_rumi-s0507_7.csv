The King's Speech," It's wonderful movie!
","This is the story about King George VI of England. Albert has been suffering from stammering since he was child. One day, he is suddenly crowned King George VI. His wife, Elizabeth can't bear to watch him, so she arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel. This movie was made based on the true story of the Royal Family, but there are not stiffness and complexity. So anyone can get smoothly into the story. I was very impressed with recreating the building and the clothes of the Royal Family realistically. Each character is very attractive. Especially I like Albert's wife, Elizabeth very much. She supporting her husband who suffering from stammering devotedly and participant in the training with him cheerfully is very wonderful. In this movie, there are three actors who appear 'Harry Potter'. I am surprised it and they looked completely different person to what they appeared in 'Harry Potter'.",10,0,0,1 October 2013

","This story is just as the subtitle suggests. It is the story of the boy who drift with a tiger for 227 days. The introduction part is too long. So I am bored for 30 minutes from I start to watch. I was convinced that it was the animal movie which was 3D for children from the preview of coming attraction in the movie theater, the title. However, I finished watching a movie and noticed that it was a mistake. This movie is profound and makes me think about various things. The expressions of the sea are different every each scene. The sea in the blue sky, the sea stained with the setting sun and the mysterious sea of the fluorescent color that night creatures color are very beautiful. Structures of Pictures and the story is very good. But I thought that it is difficult for Japanese people that faith of the religion was light to understand this work.",8,1,3,1 October 2013

","Although this movie was made on a small budget, I think it is very interesting. At first, aliens are refugees, and the situation that, and they are isolated like the apartheid in Johannesburg policy is novel. You can enjoy this movie enough even when you do not have a preliminary knowledge of this movie. In the scene of the beginning, I felt parent and child of the alien were very gross creatures but I have empathized with them all too soon. Because I don't have good feeling for the chief character, I can watch it in a neutral viewpoint from the one step remote place. This is slightly different from the common SF movies story that Aliens invades the earth and human fight against them. I think a new type of alien's movie. In respect of focusing on the xenogeneic problem, this movie is similar to the hit movie 'Avatar'.",7,0,0,1 October 2013
Inception," Complicated...
","This is the story to get in a dream of another person, and to steal an idea. Although there were similar movies by now, the great points of this movie are that the dream become the multiplex structure and is very complicated story.It is difficult for me to understand the story by watching only one time. So this is a movie that I want to see again. In the scene of the beginning, I was at a loss for the impossible premise. But, as the story progresses, I was drawn into it unconsciously. The picture is really amazing. It is interesting enough just to watch the picture. Particularly, the weightless scene is the best part. It is very strange how this scene was filmed. The way of ending that is not clear and can be interpreted various way is also good. To see this movie, I thought that a dream was mysterious once more.",8,1,2,1 October 2013

The Social Network," The Social Network
","This movie is based on the true story of Mark Zuckerberg who is the Facebook founder. The boy who became the youngest billionaire in the world lose his family, best friend and lover on the way that he reaches the top. This movie is different from the simple success story of the man who get millions wealth and fame. In contrast with the rhythm that picture and BGM flowing slowly, characters have a speedy conversation. The discord between them is interesting. Although there are various movie, I felt empty after watching this movie. Portraiture of Mark Zuckerberg is consistent from the beginning to the last. He changes nothing whereas Facebook he made grows up steadily. It is surprising that the man who makes the Facebook lacks communication skill. Various human relations in the modern society are drawn cleverly. It can be never said that it was an interesting work, but it makes me think about various things.",7,0,0,1 October 2013
