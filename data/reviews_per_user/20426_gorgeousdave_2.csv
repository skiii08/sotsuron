Unfortunately, he met an accident when an 800-pound boulder traps his right arm in the canyons. With just a few hiking stuffs with him, Aron knew it's impossible to be rescued by anyone, at least not until he's still alive and breathing. So with much courage, Aron knew he needed to save himself and after five days of being trapped, amputating his lower right arm, he magnificently extricated himself from the canyons and had a second chance in life.Words are not enough to compliment a movie like 127 Hours which,CONTINUE READING AT http://gorgeousdave.blogspot.com/2011/02/127-hours.html",10,0,7,9 February 2011
