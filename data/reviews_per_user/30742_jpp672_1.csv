Walk the Line," Walk The Line
","This movie is excellent, I saw it last night and it is a very accurate portrayal of Johnny Cash's life. Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon's acting in this movie were Oscar worthy. If your going to see a movie, see this one. Another great part about this movie is that all of the Johnny Cash songs that were sung were sung by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Also, 'Elvis' and 'Jerry Lee Lewis' are featured in this movie and sing some of their excellent songs as well.This movie is a good one even for people who aren't big Cash fans. Walk the line is an excellent story with drama, comedy, romance, and music. In seeing this movie, I also learned a lot that I didn't already know. See this movie.",9,2,5,20 November 2005
