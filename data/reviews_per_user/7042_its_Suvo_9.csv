It," BEST REMAKE IN HORROR GENRE
","Usually the horror remakes turns out to be worst movies of the year ..but this one hits the ball out of park with perfect casting , storytelling , direction .
There were plenty of thrilling moments & jump scares aren't stupid/irritating like other horror flicks.Bill Skarsg√•rd as pennywise is the highlight of this film. His performance is beyond great .
It's one of those rare horror flicks that r really great & has repeat value",7,0,1,18 October 2018
The Town," JUST AMAZING!
","Can't remember a good film about bank robbers other than this. Ben Affleck is really did a great job as a director and screenplay writer, not as much as actor. Sometime his dialogue delivery feels heartless, he just reads his lines loudly, major cons of this flick. But this doesn't takes u away from film's good parts.
GOOD THINGS 1) THE CHARACTERS- They are interesting, Thanks to well written script, Jeremy runner shines, his performance is so much better than other actors, He really captures the essence of a Boston bank robber (his character). He is funny, smart, loves his family but with short temper ( typical ) . Blake lively looked so hot in this movie, she did a good job same as other actors.
2) DIRECTION- Affeck did a great job as a director. First bank robbery scene is really good. He really did a good job maintaining the flow of the movie , so it doesn't get boring. Romance or romantic scenes between Affleck & the girl is really well done, it really doesn't disturb the main plot . The ENDING is perfect to me . Ending wise it is better than heat imo. I watched this on Netflix, worth watching!",8,0,1,29 June 2019
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," The Untold story -Lazy Filmmaking!
","First of all there is nothing untold here or any twisting unknown events of mahi's life. If u follow dhoni's crucial International cricket matches and interviews where he talks about his early career etc etc. then u can skip this flick. Flim is trying to portray him some kinda god. Lack of dramatic moments, bad dialogue r the major weak points, like they just shown few moments of final matches of world cups...that is enough? Zero interaction between him and his teammates.. what makes him such a good leader ? But it has time to play same love story scenes again twice . Sushant doesn't resembles to dhoni anyway , neither close to his looks nor his body language, on the other hand guy who play yuvi got those things. Editing done horribly, nearly 30 min can be removed from the movie.
There r certain good elements like how they portray his childhood, his interaction with his family, friends etc. That's it!",5,1,1,30 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Refreshingly New film from Tarantino!
","Yep ! Finally a new Tarantino film that doesn't centered around crime/ gangstar / revenge etc. This is a light hearted film about old Hollywood and struggle of an actor during the transition. Of course the character manson is in it but him and his crime isn't the focus of this film. They're used to deliver another message!
Throughout the film old Hollywood and surrounding area , car , theater, people looks authentic (as they are in 60s ) . Production design is top notch. Leo and brad together holds good. Their chemistry as a actor and his stuntman is friendly, funny and overall awesome. Al Pacino is just in cameo and margo's role is extended cameo. The film never gets boring, hilarious scenes here and there , good dialogue, interesting scenes like cliff visting Manson family yard will keep u going. I don't find Bruce lee a arrogant in the film , his and cliff's interaction is funny as cliff got fired. First meeting between leo and little girl is good and the ransom scene is really well acted , quite funny.
Finally climax is quite shocking, violent and yes hilarious too. Tag team action with cliff and his dog and finally rick with his flamethrower is cherry over top. When rick said 'I torched them ' LMFAO scene. A really feel good ending as rick and sharon got to know each other.",7,1,4,16 September 2019
Insidious," Poltergeist Reloaded ft. James wan
","First of all the director tried to do everything to made this a perfect Horror-thriller/or even masterpiece according to some people ! but failed at every dept.All James wan r Filled with very unnecessary jump scare scenes.. this1 is not an exception. Also it will be followed by some nonsense sequel..so watch out !!Family(Father bloodline) with a Sp. gift+evil spirit following them+Ghosts in the new house they moved in ... oh! anything left dear director sir ?? 1 st one which seems to be unique but only to writer audiences already watched it in poltergeist..they added some of their nonsense in it.They tried to frighten people with Red demon ,which actually made me laugh when he climbs like spider man on the wall & A psycho evil killer spirit following Child's father with a secret desire .Director tried to create some nonsense craziness with this psycho, worst part of the movie. goes to end in a diff. way rather than Happy ending !! which is not enough to save it!!once a wise man said A Bad can Ruin your day ! so watch it at your on RISK",5,0,0,8 October 2017

Avatar," MOST OVERRATED Movie of All Time !
","It's all spectacle , under developed/ non developed substances.
Seriously Cameron claims bringing original content? Plot is directly copied from previous few movies, anime even video games ! Paid media made hype, tricking audiences that it's a masterpiece.
It's Fking giant theme park ride , like those avail. In Disneyland !",6,1,2,14 February 2019
The Untouchables," Disappointing!
","Untouchables from de plama is a very Disappointing flick after his magnificent Scarface remake!
He isn't Scorsese , that's why goodfellas worked , and yes they're similar although they're telling story from different prospective! another nuch better movie American gangster!
Good thing - 1) PRODUCTION DESIGN- they just nailed it , no question!
2) AL CAPONE PERFORMANCE- Every single scene with him is on another level. They way he portrays a Italian mafia is just awesome! He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol
Bad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie.
From the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene. The elevator scene is pretty good. Not the train station scene, here bad guy's aim just sucks.
2) BAD MUSIC
3) BAD DIRECTION, LAZY WRITING
Here at last Brian de palma is a really good director . His movies like carrie, scarface , carlito's way are real gems.",6,3,9,6 June 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Soo DISAPPOINTING !
","This movie wants to be serious , but ends up being a JOKE MATERIAL . Main plot doesn't make any sense with 10000 sub plots Characters are POORLY written , with supes being worst , ben affleck is just playing himself ,also featuring WORST lex luthor EVER !
Terrible CGI , snyder's hamm handed direction killed the movie.
As a life-long DC comics fan , a bat vs supes movie is like childhood dream comes true !
i watched in IMAX ,so disappointed but i couldn't get my refund
One sentence review- IT'S an UTTER CRAP !",3,1,5,5 February 2019
