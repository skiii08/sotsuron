Changeling," Changeling: A Comment.
","Almost everything within the film is calculated to hit extra hard at our emotional chords, to tug our heartstrings in support of the heroine, fill us with rage and disgust at the sight of the actions of the powerful leaders in the story, and, of course, jerk the tears from eyes. Eastwood's more recent films in particular are known to contain some sentimentality but, until now, he's refrained from hitting us over the head with the overexuberant brand of saccharin, meritless emotion found in many other films based on real-life accounts of peril and injustice. Yet, that is a particular test 'Changeling' does not quite pass, though it is still far above some of the biggest and worst weepies in the room ('Tsotsi,' anyone? Or, perhaps you would prefer shedding tears to 'Central Station'?).Part of the problem is the way the central character is portrayed, not entirely due to Jolie's work, but also to the fact that she, and as such her character, comes across as rather too glamorous for the predicaments she finds herself in. Even during the most trying scenes, such as searching frantically for her missing son, dealing with a police department that is, at best, apathetic and, at worst, one of the chief causes of grief Christine Collins (Jolie) and the audience are made to suffer, she seems oddly beautiful in a way that leaves a disconnect, to the detriment of any realism the movie may have otherwise had, with the drama that unfolds.As was the case in last year's 'A Mighty Heart,' in which the actress delivers another impassioned performance as a woman who is, in many ways, in a similar situationtragically wronged by circumstances and people beyond her controlit is often difficult to see past her movie-star glitter to get to the raw agony at the core of her character. A large part of this has to do with how the film visually presents her. Her hair and makeup are just right enough to flatter her, even during her most trying times within a grim psychiatric ward, many of the patients of which arrived unwillingly mainly because they were an inconvenience to the police and others in power. She is always filmed by the director of photography, Tom Stern, to look beautiful, almost saintly. That's not a criticism of his work in the film generally; it appropriately renders a vivid interpretation of a 1920s Los Angeles reminiscent of old Hollywood pictures. However, it does distract from Jolie.Despite the objections, the film is by no means ruined by the glamour and the oversentimentality. Rather, these are mainly a distraction from what is otherwise a compelling and memorable story, written by J. Michael Straczynski, otherwise told relatively well. The basic story is perhaps the best thing about the film, more likely than not because it it presents an inherently compelling situation. The way scenes are intricately intercut (by editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach) so as to play off each other is an old tool of storytelling that is used to good effect here, though more for dramatic effect than as an essential method of conveying the plot. Overall, the film could have been more efficient, with a few minutes being trimmed from the film, most obviously the aforementioned Oscar scene. Also, some sequences do feel repetitious in plot and especially in the emotions evoked.In the end, while 'Changeling' is an engrossing story, its distractions interfere with the film, rendering it far from perfect, and, ultimately, minor Eastwood.",4,4,12,31 January 2009
Frost_Nixon," Frost/Nixon: A Review.
","Though far from being one of the defining films of the president at its center, 'Frost/Nixon' is an interesting-enough take on his famous post-resignation interviews in an era when Americans were disenchanted with the office of their president, though it follows the typical formula of its director.Although 'Frost/Nixon,' the new movie from director Ron Howard, is presaged on Richard Nixon, the United States president who resigned from office in disgrace, and his series of interviews in 1977 with the British television talk show host David Frost, it is more about people working to overcome the odds and obstacles they face in order to prevail when most other people expected otherwise. In other words, it basically follows the typical Ron Howard formula, like 'Apollo 13' and 'Cinderella Man.' This is not to diminish the premise of the film in any way, as it remains an intriguing one, nonetheless, despite the foregone conclusions of those who are familiar with Howard's other work. The second major political docudrama set in the 1970s to premiere in US theaters in about as many weeks (after 'Milk') 'Frost/Nixon' has been given the visual appearance of a somewhat a downbeat documentary, with its frequently muted colors and dim lighting, by cinematographer Salvatore Totino, as well as a light, often comical, though not always appropriate, feel by writer Peter Morgan. The various key players from both sidesexcept the two in the title roleseach appear in their own little 'interviews' talking about their recollections concerning the main topic at hand and, in so doing, providing a narrative context of sorts (a device loosely similar to that employed by 'Milk').The picture is at its most riveting when it shows the destruction of such a man during the interviews by Frost, who was widely considered unqualified for the task of doing just that. Nixon, who held the most prominent and powerful job in the world, who finally forced to admit to himself, through Frost's interviews, that much of his presidency, and himself, is a sham, that his legacy will reflect as such for all future generations in the US, and that he will have to live with it for the rest of his life. That is, by far, the most interesting part of the movie.Yet, only a relatively small portion, the last half-hour of a feature with a running time four times that length, is devoted to it. The remainder concerns itself, essentially, with David Frost's underestimation of his subject and his failings as a serious journalist. Frost, incarnated by Michael Sheen (also reprising his Broadway stage role), is a talk show playboy who is very nearly the definition of carefree and flamboyant. But he is also ambitious and, ultimately, determined. This is a man who seeks a seven-part television interview with Richard Nixon, despite not having what most journalists and broadcasters would consider the right credentials, and attains it. That, however, is only the start of the battle toward realizing his goal, as he must find financing to actually produce the series of episodes, financing that remains elusive even during the actual taping. Then, there's the small matter that Frost has no clue how to handle an interviewee as shrewd and manipulative as 'Tricky Dick' Nixon, who is an expert at twisting critical questions to his advantage and dominating a conversation by rambling on about the extensive small details in his considerably large memory.",6,2,7,31 January 2009
Milk," Milk: A Review.
","It's a bitter irony that a major film about the iconic gay rights leader Harvey Milk should premiere in theaters across the country less than a month after Proposition 8 passed in California by voter referendum, thus barring gay marriage, for the moment. Similar laws were enacted in a number of other states in the country. One could imagine Milk may have been disheartened at such news, coming three decades after his efforts toward the civil rights struggles of a people. But, after seeing 'Milk,' the newest movie about his activism, politics and life, one could imagine that he and his sizable movement would be all the more determined to bring about equality for gays and lesbians.Appropriately, the picture is shot, by Director of Photography Harris Savides, largely with a documentary-style aesthetic that is both no-nonsense and candid, frequently mixing footage from actual marches, television reports, newspaper layouts and the like, into the rest of the film in a way that is relatively seamless (thanks, in part, to fine editing by Elliot Graham). My only quip about this is that perhaps the new scenes made for this film could have had a more grainy aesthetic to more thoroughly blend with the archival footage. But it's only a minor issue in a movie that is visually well-presented. The handful of new black and white stills pictures that Harvey takes of his partner, Scott, are particularly intriguing.The resemblance to a documentary style of film-making doesn't end there, of course. Since this drama is about real people and events, there's bound to be some aspect of it that feels like a documentary. 'Docudrama'  with the emphasis on the first half of the word would be a convenient and apt description for this film, if one must categorize. In some ways this new film is a remake of 'The Times of Harvey Milk,' a first-rate documentary directed by Robert Epstein that appeared nearly twenty-five years ago. If there's any drawback to the current 'Milk' it's that it covers so much of the same ground as the older film that those who have seen Epstein's project already know much of what will transpire in the new version. Aside from that, the newer 'Milk' does delve more deeply and satisfactorily into its main subject's personal life and, because of its status as a docudrama, Van Sant is able to utilize the tools of creative and dramatic license at his disposal much more freely than Epstein could have, to greater emotional impact. We see more actual dialogue and relationships between Milk and his partners, friends, colleagues and others, something that wouldn't be likely with a regular documentary. In this way the subject at the center of attention of the new film seems more soulful, more human than he would otherwise. (That's not a criticism of Epstein's film.) So does everyone around him. The movie does a remarkable job at making all these people seem real.The creative team captures the look and spirit of the Milk's time and place quite well, due in no small measure to Bill Groom's production design and Danny Glicker's clothing (and all that big hair). The actors look remarkably similar to the actual people they portray, with the centerpiece being the magnificent Sean Penn ('All the King's Men,' 'Mystic River') whose resemblance to his subject, Harvey Milk, is so uncannily close in appearance and voice one could mistake him for the actual person. It seems that Penn's looks did not have to be modified much as he looks much like Milk to begin with, though Milk's hair seems a bit curlier. The film is a treasure-trove of fine acting from its major players.'Milk' will be remembered, in the very least, as one of the milestones in gay cinema. But, it deserves a higher honor: recognition as an important film about civil rights, and recognition as an important film, period.",9,2,6,31 January 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas: A Comment.
","Perhaps the most important concern of the story is naiveté. Not simply childhood naiveté but the childlike version in adults. It is this that is not only one of the most interesting aspects of the picture, but its most problematic. It manifests itself here in Bruno's initial perception of the 'farm' and the workers in their striped PJs, which is one thing. More sadly, but less believably, it also is reflected in the fact that the depth of the systemic hatred and lack of humanity in Bruno's father (David Thewlis), not to mention the dark details of his new job, barely register at first with Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), an innocent, then concerned, then indignant woman with some shreds of humanity that she fails to act upon until she sees her children become too exposed to the cruel philosophies and actions of their father and his henchmen.As the story progresses, the level of ignorance of the two boys at its center regarding the circumstances that envelop them becomes less and less plausible, especially considering that they each witness and experience some of the abuse of the soldiers first-hand. Late into the film, Bruno has seen some of the rougher side of his father, yet, when asked by Shmuel if he is proud of his father, Bruno responds in the affirmative with seemingly a minimum of hesitation. Further, Bruno seems to have little if any doubts about his family, even in the face of his sister's rapidly increasing phobia, militancy, and hatred. Most profoundly, despite the fact that Shmuel himself toils in the camp, he does not even come close to suspecting that the explanations he is given about his and his parents' predicament, why he was transported there, and why people in the compound keep mysteriously disappearing may be weak attempts to mask something that is wrong. It's nearly impossible to accept that, when he realizes his own father is missing, he starts searching the camp for him, oblivious to the notion, despite where he is, that he may have been murdered. It isn't until the final, waning minutes in the film, when the boysBruno especially, but to an extent even Shmuelbegin to better comprehend the wickedness of the camp. These may be kids, but I doubt real children in similar circumstances would be as clueless as the film assumes they would be, no matter at which side of the fence the sit.The basic conceit of the film is certainly engaging and there are many scenes that are memorable for their drama, tension, and horror, but, in its realization, the filmmakers attribute so much permanence to childhood innocence that much of the story's credibility is undermined. They assume that such innocence can continue to survive, will not erode, even under circumstances as difficult and raw as these.",4,6,12,31 January 2009
