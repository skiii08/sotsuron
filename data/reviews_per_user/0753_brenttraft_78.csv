Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not For Outsiders
","People who buy into Tarantino's world of cartoon violence are going to love this film but for anyone else it will be tedious and dull.Really, the only thing good I can say about this film is that it is visually well done.  It is a shame that such a talented film maker does not have the courage to try to make a serious film or at least something different than his previous films and instead keeps making the same movie over and over. With the plethora of comic book and video game based movies that come out on a weekly basis, 'Kill Bill' is redundant.Also, I did not laugh at any of the 'clever-one-liners' that Tarantino's fans are so impressed with.  I've heard better in other movies.Overall, Tarantino fans will love it because it is just like all his other films.  Everyone else should skip it.",4,3,6,17 April 2004
Black Swan," 'I had the craziest dream last night...'
","That is the opening line from the new horror film 'Black Swan.' Some of the critics are debating whether 'Black Swan' is a horror film or a psychological thriller but it is actually both. While is is one of the most hyped movie of the awards season, it is not a movie for everyone. Fanboys are probably going to see it about the much talked about sex scene but that scene only lasts about a minute. About half the film is ballet performance or ballet rehearsing. In that regard it is much like Robert Altman's 'The Company.' If you don't like ballet, you might get bored. But as the film progresses, Nina sacrifices herself for her art and loses her sense of reality and the film turns into a horror movie with the distinctive that only Darren Aronofsky can bring. You can read more detailed plot synopsis in other reviews. 'Black Swan' is the best horror film since 'Muholland Drive' and one of the best horror film of all time.",10,5,11,18 December 2010
Changeling," An Old Fashioned Downer of a Film
","Don't expect to leave 'Changeling' with a smile on your face. This is the type of movie Hollywood used to make in the 30's and 40's where there isn't necessarily a happy ending.It is kind of like taking 'L.A. Confidential,' 'Mystic River,' 'One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,' and 'In Cold Blood,' and putting them in one movie.It's a very well made film but the thing that really makes it special is the performance by Angelina Jolie. She is in virtually every scene and she does not resort to overacting like some others. It is subtle in some places and dramatic when needed. She makes you care about her character.The other star of course is Clint Eastwood. The film is made with such skill that it never seems cheap or exploitive.'Changeling' is not the popular escapism that most films aspire to these days but it is easily one of the best films of the year.",10,7,13,9 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Hopefully, The Last Mission
","'Mission Impossible: 3' is by far the best of the series, but it also has the same flaws as the previous installments.In the television show, they always setup an elaborate sting operation to trick the bad guys into giving them what they wanted. In the movies, they just blow up a bunch of stuff.'MI: 3' takes itself way too seriously while being totally ridiculous and major plot points are never explained. They would have been better off making a comedy.The cinematography is the best thing about the film. It has a great look to it.The 'Mission Impossible' movies are basically just James Bond without the accent. If they are not going to bother with a decent story, then it is time they call it quits.",5,0,0,12 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," SLevin Reasons Why This Film is Disappointing
","1. The script is not as clever as it wants to be. The script is an Elmore Leonard wannabe. It tries to have slick, snappy dialog, but always falls short of the real thing. The basic story is okay, but some of the twists are more contrived than they need to be.2. The directing is not as slick as it wants to be. Last month's 'Running Scared' was a similar type of film and was done much better. 'Lucky Number SLeven' is crude by comparison.3. Great cast, but little screen time. Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are great, but they are not in the film enough. Bruce Willis is not given much to do but smirk. Stanley Tucci has a small, thankless role. Lucy Lui is great and has the luxury of being the only female character in the film.4. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in, and this is no exception. The movie producers must have thought if they got some really good actors for this film, nobody would notice how bad Josh Hartnett is, but it's the opposite. Having good actors only intensifies how bad Josh Hartnett really is.5. This film is designed to be a 'guy flick,' but we see Josh Hartnett in a towel for half the film while Lucy Lui is fully clothed. By doing that, they do not really appeal to anybody.6. The music sucks and is not memorable.7. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in. I couldn't think of any other reasons, so I thought I would overstate the obvious. It's too bad, because this film had potential, but they really screwed it up. Even so, it will probably make a decent rental.",4,11,27,15 April 2006
Marie Antoinette," Impressionistic Film
","'Marie Antoinette' is sure to divide viewers because it is such an innovative film. Those that are expecting a biopic will be disappointed. Those expecting a progression from 'Lost in Translation' will be ecstatic.'Marie Antoinette' is an impressionistic film. Like a Van Gogh or a Monet, it does not resemble real life very much. It is full of color and music. It is like a young women's impression of what it must have been like to have been the last queen of France. She was spoiled rotten and had no training on how to rule a country.Like 'Lost in Translation,' it is best in the quiet moments. It is beautifully photographed and mixes period music by Rameau and others with modern pop music from the 1980's. This is appropriate because it is a modern woman's impression of 18th century France.This is not a film for everyone. Many people are going to hate it and not understand it. Those who are open to film as an art form will love it and treasure it.",10,8,15,28 October 2006
Deja Vu," Entertaining, but Nothing New
","Sometimes a good movie can be more frustrating than a bad one and that is the case in 'Deja Vu.' The problem is that the description of the movie on IMDb tells you it involves time travel and the trailer shows Denzel Washington with the murder victim, so you know it is going to happen. But this part of the film comes in the last 30 minutes.'Deja Vu' is a good movie but with a little editing and a little reworking of script, it could have been a great one.Tony Scott has toned down his directing style a bit from 'Man on Fire' and 'Domino,' but it is still a nice looking film.I had never seen Paula Patton before and she is really good, but she is hardly in the movie. I wish they had made her role bigger. Denzel Washington is good, as always. Val Kilmer really needs to go on a diet. He gets fatter in every film.The music was okay, but the film would have benefited from a better score.'Deja Vu' is almost a great science fiction movie. It involves time travel and you have to suspend belief. If you like good action film that requires a decent amount of thinking, you might want to see 'Deja Vu.'",8,2,4,25 November 2006
Minority Report," A Worthy Successor to Blade Runner and 12 Monkeys
","This is not an average Spielberg film.  It has more in common with Blade Runner and 12 Monkeys than A.I.  While some people might want to over-analyze the details and pick apart the story; it really is not that kind of movie. It is a good summer flick where the creepy atmosphere is more important than the story.  And as far as the directing goes, Spielberg uses every trick in the book and always keeps it interesting to watch.As far as I am concerned, this is Spielberg's finest film!",10,0,1,22 June 2002
Finding Neverland," Dull and Depressing
","Finding Neverland is a well made, well thought out film. Despite that, I found it boring and depressing. I did not like any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. I resented being told about the power of 'belief' over and over again.This film was just what I was expecting from the advertisements and reviews. There were no surprises. It is not a bad film, but I did not enjoy watching it. For me, it lacked entertainment value. I realize I'm in the minority on this film, but I guess it's just not for everyone.Still there is much to admire technically. 6/10",6,1,3,22 December 2004
Memento," Art, Entertainment, and Humor; All in One Convient Movie
","When this film first came out, I was blown away. It was the first film since 'L.A. Confidential' that I actually liked and renewed my faith in film as art and entertainment.Unlike so many of the films coming out of the Hollywood money machine, this film actually started with a very well written script and everything else was built around the script. What a concept! The script had to be thought out really well because of the format of showing the end first and going backwards in segments. Also the use of using black and white for part of the story that moves forward and using color for the main part of the story which is told backwards.There's great dialog in this film and despite the 'noir' concept, it has quite a sense of humor. At one point Leonard defends his affliction by saying 'memory is unreliable.' Burt tells Leonard 'it's all backwards,' which is speaking about the format of the film.The cast is universally excellent. Guy Pierce does a west coast accent that had me fooled, and I have lived here all my life. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are better than they were in 'The Matrix.' The ending is rather ambiguous. There is debate whether you should not believe Teddy because he lies or if he is telling the truth because he knows that Leonard will not remember anyway. There are some hints where we see a glimpse of Sammy in the mental hospital and then see Leonard in his place. We see a glimpse of Leonard giving his wife an insulin shot, but then he decides that she was not diabetic and he remembers that he was only pinching her. There is a shot of him laying next to his wife, covered in his tattoos full of clues. We don't what is really memory and what is imagination. This is pretty much Leonard's state of mind also.It's a shame that Christopher Nolen has chosen a career in Hollywood after doing this independent masterpiece. Hopefully he will make a whole bunch of money and go back to making entertaining art films.",10,0,2,29 May 2005
Coraline," Greatest Animation Film Ever but not for Kids or Pixar Fans
","I normally do not like animated films and I have been disappointed by most of the critically acclaimed animated films to come out the past few year. However, I was intrigued by the trailers for 'Coraline' and I saw it the first weekend it was out and I was not disappointed.The story isn't anything special. It is similar to 'Alice in Wonderland' or 'Spirited Away.' What make 'Coraline' so special is the design of the sets and characters. It looks like a Edvard Munch painting. Another thing I liked was that it does not try to be cute or funny. It doesn't condescend to the audience.'Coraline' will probably not make big money like the Pixar films. 'Coraline' isn't going to sell a bunch of toys and young children are probably not going to like it. If you like artistically uncompromising films, you might like it. People will be talking about this film 10 years from now. See it in the theater while you have the chance.This is my favorite animated film of all time.",10,1,4,8 February 2009
The Notebook," A Cinematic Experience
","I'm not sure why the professional reviews were so mixed on this film because it is an excellent production.The story might be hackneyed and predictable but anyone who has seen the ads pretty much know what they are getting into.  The thing that makes The Notebook so much better than the average romance film is there was so much care put into the production.  The cinematography is the best since Seabiscuit!  The music is good and used judiciously.  The editing is non-intrusive, which is a rare thing these days.  The acting is fine all around, especially by Rachael McAdams.  It's too bad Hollywood does not put this much attention to detail in more of their movies. 
Do yourself a favor and see this one on the big screen.  It is truly an all around satisfying cinematic experience.  9/10",10,0,0,27 June 2004
Oldboy," What if a David Lynch Film Were Coherent?
","I was shocked when I watched 'Oldboy' on DVD.The movie was really well filmed, acted, written, and scored. It kept me guessing until the very end. When the ending came, it took me completely by surprise. I could not have guessed the ending in a million years.'Oldboy' is not for the squeamish or for people looking for light entertainment. This movie makes you think about the characters and the story. You need to pay close attention because seemingly unimportant things end up being vital to the plot. It is extremely violent at times.It is like a David Lynch film in that it is really strange and grotesque but unlike David Lynch, the ending explains everything.The DVD defaults to English dubbing, which is not very good. I recommend watching it in the original language with subtitles. 'Oldboy' is my favorite foreign language film of all time! If you like good, original storytelling and are not squeamish, you might like 'Oldboy.'",10,22,92,26 August 2006
The Others," Could have been Better!
","This film was very frustrating for me because it had a lot going for it.  It was beautifully filmed, had a good cast, and atmospheric music. Unfortunately, it was also too long, there was a lot of repetition, and it was hard to like any of the characters.  Nicole Kidman spent too much time yelling at the kids and the servants and it took too long for her to figure out that maybe the house is haunted.  Everybody else in the movie is as stiff as boards.On the other hand, it is still better than 99% of the garbage out there.",6,0,0,24 March 2002
Troy," $160 Million Does Not Buy What It Used To
","I wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before doling out $160 Million for this mistake? Actually, the script keeps things moving at a decent pace but the dialog is the worst since Gigli and at times is laughably bad.For $160 million I expected it to look like a cost-no-object spectacle but instead it ends up looking like they were trying to cut corners.  The cast is mostly second rate.  Brad Pitt looks more like Goldielocks or a surfer boy than a savage warrior.  Although he might look good on a magazine cover, he cannot carry a movie.  Peter O'Toole is the only one that comes out with his reputation intact but his good performance makes everyone else look worse in perspective.The music is by James Horner, who is the person studios turn to when they cannot afford John Williams.  When John Williams does a score, it sticks in your mind long after the film is over.  I cannot remember any of the music from Troy.Wolfgang Petersen had never had a really big hit before and his directing style is pretty mediocre.  The photography is okay but nothing special. This comes off looking like a fairly low budget movie.  I cannot tell where they spent all the money.  This was a major disappointment but it was still watchable. 5/10.",5,0,1,30 May 2004
Juno," Best Film of 2007
","After seeing the trailer for 'Juno,' I went in expecting it to be the best film of 2007. Anything else and I would have been disappointed. I was not disappointed.The entire cast is excellent. It is easily the best ensemble in any film this year. Ellen Page is in every scene and she is able to carry the film. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman give their best big screen performances ever.The trailer makes the film seem like it is going to be a laugh a minute. The trailer actually uses some of the funniest lines from the film, but it is more than just a comedy. It is a touching film that leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling afterward.If you are looking for an uplifting film to get away from all the drab, downbeat films coming out this holiday season, you should see 'Juno.'",10,5,16,21 December 2007
Match Point," Woody Noir
","'Match Point' is reminiscent of Film Noir of the 40's like 'The Postman Always Rings Twice,' 'Double Indemity,' and 'A Place In the Sun.' Like those films, it is a story of an ordinary nice guy who get lured to the dark side by lust and money.While the story might borrow more than a little from James M. Cain, what really sets 'Match Point' apart from the older films is the excellent dialog and it's use of irony.A lot of people are not going to like this film because it is very dialog heavy and you have to really pay attention to every word to fully appreciate it. Since most people are used to CGI and short sentences, it is probably going to have a hard time finding an audience. For people who put forth the effort, it is very rewarding.Opera fans will be happy to know there is opera singing throughout a large portion of the film, mostly from old recordings of Enrico Caruso. Opera is mostly about sex and murder, so it fits into the themes of the film. An additional point of irony in the film is that the most commonly played aria, 'Una furtiva lagrima,' while sounding dramatic, is from the opera 'The Elixer of Love, which is a comedy; the irony being that this suspense film is written and directed by a film maker usually associated with comedy.The acting is very good all around, especially Scarlett Johansson who plays a sultry femme fatale. She shows a side I've not seen in previous films.'Match Point' is not an easy film to watch. You have to pay close attention and listen to every word of the dialog. If you are willing to put forth the effort, this is a very fine film.",9,13,21,7 January 2006
The Prestige," The Ultimate Magic Trick
","'The Prestige' is easily the best film in the last two years.I've seen it twice so far and I enjoyed it more the second time around because many of the scenes that had seemed flawed the first time around are actually very important to the plot.'The Prestige' is a magic trick unto it's self. It actually has two twists and both are revealed in the first few minutes of the film and are continued to be revealed throughout; but still, we are surprised by the ending.I don't want to give anything away, so just be sure to watch carefully. Then go back and see it again and if you pay very close attention, you will see that everything actually fits into place perfectly.My pet peeve with Hollywood is that they spend $200 on special effects but don't bother with writing a decent script. The script for 'The Prestige' was obviously thought out and re-thought until it was flawless. If you don't fully understand the ending, you can read some of the message boards on this website to have it explained.After 'Momento,' I had expected great things from Christopher Nolan. 'The Prestige' is the film I had been waiting for.",10,2,3,28 October 2006
Silent Hill," Lousy Script Sabotages a Well Made Film
","In many regards, 'Silent Hill' is a good film. It was obviously made with a lot of thought and care. The directing and cinematography are done well. The acting is good.Everything that is wrong with this film could have been fixed before a single frame was shot. The script is terrible! There is hardly any dialog other than the shouting of people's names. The last 15 minutes attempts to make up some sort of explanation for what proceeded it, but that just makes things worse since it does not make any sense.'Silent Hill' will probably play well on cable since individual scenes taken out of context look really good. When watched in it's entirety, it is a frustrating experience because the pieces never really fit together.",4,1,5,23 April 2006
Ocean's Twelve," All Dressed Up With No Where To Go
","If you were to walk into 'Ocean's Twelve' halfway through, you would probably think it was an okay picture. If you were wanting to know what you missed in the first half, it would be 'nothing much.'The first half of this film is so boring, it makes it hard to recommend. The second half is much better, but it does not justify having to sit through the first half. There are two problems with this film: First, the jokes are not very funny. Second, the movie is not very much fun. Maybe they should have come up with a better premise or a better script before making this sequel.Technically, the film is done with a lot of style but the filmmakers seem to have trouble finding room for all the characters. They could have trimmed a lot of the fat by making this 'Ocean's Six.' 4/10.",4,7,9,12 December 2004
Crash," Best Film of 2005
","'Crash' is easily the best film of 2005. Despite that, it is a very controversial film that has it detractors and some people really hate this film.The people who hate this film do so because they take it literally. Like all great works of literature, it is a parable for the the world we live in, not an accurate depiction. This is not a documentary. There is a multitude of characters who are all racist, victim, and hero at the same time. The snowing at the end represents that improbable things could happen at any time.The dialog is the crown jewel of the film and has more impact than explosions. The ensemble acting is first rate. Sandra Bullock only has a small roll, but gives the best performance of her career. Don Cheadle shows that he belongs in with the top tier of actors. The photography and cinematography is better than most. Only a couple of rock songs at the end of the film detract from an otherwise first rate production. The dialog is abrasive. The violence is sudden and shocking. People were gasping in the theater when I saw it. The film does not pay anyone any favors. It is sure to be offensive no matter what your skin color. It is an equal opportunity offender.'Crash' is one of the very best films of all time.",10,3,11,4 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Extremely Violent and Depressing
","There is no debating that 'Pan's Labrynth' is a well made movie, but it is so relentlessly violent, sadistic, and depressing; that I could not enjoy it.Judging by the popularity of this film on this website and the professional reviews, apparently the amount of sadistic violence does not bother most people. I have certainly been able to sit though my share, but this film was so repulsive that I cannot say I had a good time watching it.I go to the movies to be entertained, not repulsed. 'Pan's Labrynth' certainly has many attributes, but don't say I didn't warn you. If you like films like 'Saw' and 'Hostel,' the violence will not bother you. If you are squeamish, you should stay away.",6,7,12,12 January 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Blood, Gore, and Catchy Tunes
","Tim Burton's version of 'Sweeney Todd' is a heavily flawed film, but it is one of the year's best films despite the flaws.The actors are all really good. Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter look like zombies. The film is very cinematic and is not like watching a stage production.Unfortunately the singing is not very good, especially if you are used to hearing 'Sweeney Todd' sung by professionals. This is not a fatal flaw but it is distracting. Also, the film is extremely gory, which might turn off many of the people who would normally like musicals.The flaws will probably be most evident to viewers that are familiar with the stage musical. If you are not familiar with it, you probably will not notice.If you like musicals with a really, really, dark sense of humor, you should see 'Sweeney Todd.'",9,0,1,13 February 2008
Closer," Mona Lisa is not smiling
","The film 'Closer' prominently features music from Mozart's opera, 'Cosi Fan Tutti.' The title does not translate into English too well but it is usually translated as 'they are all like that.' The opera is about 2 couples that swap lovers on a bet in order to prove that women are unfaithful by nature. At the end of the opera the men don't come off looking any better than the women. The opera is a comedy; this film is not.'Closer' is basically a filmed play. All the drama comes from the dialog. If you liked 'The Hours,' 'We Don't Live Here Anymore,' and '21 Grams,' then you will probably like 'Closer.' If you are not comfortable peering into the dark side of human nature and the sadistic side of sexuality, you should not see this film. This is a film about people who are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside.This is an art film. It uses an interesting device of skipping large amounts of time without telling the viewer. You find out in the dialog that the film has suddenly skipped ahead a year or more. This is a challenging film that requires the viewer actively think during the entire film and especially at the ending. If you go to movies in order to stop thinking, you will probably not like this film. Also, if you are offended by graphic sexual dialog, do not see this film. The dialog in this film makes 'Kinsey' seem tame by comparison. If you have trouble figuring out the ending, remember that the names at the memorial were people who died saving children and 'truth is what separates us from the animals.' Afterwards, you can decide who was the most manipulative character in the film.The cinematography and the dialog are some of the best I've seen in several years. We get so few adult oriented films these days; you should catch this one on the big screen while you have the chance. This is a rare opportunity to see some real literary emotional drama. It is a film that keeps you thinking after you leave the theater. This gets a 10/10.",10,2,5,4 December 2004
Capote," A New Front Runner For Most Overrated Film of the Year
","In reading the professional reviews for 'Capote,' I was expecting one of the best films of all time. It got a 95% from Rotten Tomatoes and 87 from Metacritic.Like many of the critic's darlings, I was bored throughout most of 'Capote.' Much of the problem might be that I have seen the film 'In Cold Blood,' which is based on the book that is the subject of 'Capote.' 'In Cold Blood' is a much superior film. I have also read the novel, which is much more interesting than this movie.The problem is that this film makes Truman Capote out to be shallow and manipulative. There is nothing to like about him. His mannerisms are ridiculous but nobody ever says anything about it. We never find out about what make Truman Capote tick.The directing and acting are good but there is nothing outstanding. Phillip Seymore Hoffman does a good job of imitating Truman Capote's mannerisms, but they are so distinctive that it is kind of like watching something from Saturday Night Live.Still this is a decent film. If you haven't seen 'In Cold Blood' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' you should see those films first. They play a prominent part in 'Capote' and they are much superior films. If you have seen those films and want a look behind the scenes, then you might enjoy 'Capote.'",5,3,14,30 October 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Sympathy for the Devil
","'The Devil Wears Prada' is worth seeing for Meryl Streep's brilliant comedic performance of the boss from hell. Other than that, this is a heavily flawed film.The directing is absolutely terrible. It is like watching a TV show on the big screen. Apparently the producers were trying to find the least expensive director they could find so they got someone with lots of TV experience but little or no movie experience. This film has no style at all! The music is some of the worst I have ever heard in a film.SPOILERLastly, Meryl Streep plays the boss from hell, but the protagonist, Ann Hathaway, does not rebel against her. Instead, she sympathizes with her at the expense of her friends. When this happens, the viewers have no one left in the film to like.END SPOILERDepite it's flaws, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is worth seeing for Meryl Streep's performance. Considering what else is in the theaters right now, this is almost the only film for adults to see right now.",5,1,2,4 July 2006
Gone Baby Gone," One of the Year's Best
","'Gone Baby, Gone' is one of the best films of the year. It is being compared to 'Mystic River' and 'The Departed' because it takes place in Boston, but I actually liked it better than either of those films.The opening credits start with the camera showing close ups of people's faces. The close ups are a recurring theme throughout the movie. It's because this is not just a film about a child kidnapping. It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others.Director Ben Affleck shows confidence and style in his first film. After this, he does not need to perform in any more films. He is a much better writer and director than he is an actor.All the performances in the film are superb. Casey Affleck has to carry the film and he does a great job. He is a stoic, deadpan, detective. But unlike the Noir detectives of the past, he is not a loner. He has a lot of friends and he has his girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan help with the investigation. He uses his connections to find out things the police cannot.Beyond that, the less you know the better.If you like crime dramas that also work as character studies, you should run out and see 'Gone Baby, Gone.'",9,150,211,20 October 2007
Burn After Reading," Odd Funny, Not Laugh Out Loud Funny
","'Burn After Reading' is a black comedy. Being that, it does not have a lot of real funny jokes that make you laugh out loud but rather it has a bunch of oddball characters that act in oddball ways when a situation arises.It it the characters that make this film worth watching. All the characters are funny in their own way. This film has one of the best casts this year.I liked this film but I usually don't like the real acclaimed Coen brother films. My favorites are 1) The Man Who Wasn't There, 2) Lady Killers, 3) The Hudsucker Proxy. 'Burn After Reading' does not compare to any of those but I thought it was as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou.' Just don't expect to be rolling on the floor with laughter. It's not that kind of comedy. It doesn't have a lot of jokes, just some funny characters.",7,6,12,12 September 2008
North by Northwest," One of the All Time Greats!
","'North By Northwest' is one of my all times favorites. It has romance, international intrigue, and comedy. It has a little something for everybody.This is a story of a mild mannered advertising executive who is mistaken for an international spy. Cary Grant is suave, sophisticated, and hilarious as this fish out of water who is thrown into a web of double agents, spies, and a seductive blonde. In one of the all time great scenes, he is waiting at a bus stop when another traveler remarks that 'that plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.' The scene starts so quietly but ends with a big bang.I saw this film in the theater with a faded old print that did not do it justice. I had the VHS tape which had been cleaned up, but the colors were real dull. The DVD has restored the colors and improved the sound.If you haven't seen 'North By Northwest' yet, don't bother to rent it. You should by a copy because it is a film you will want to see again and again. It is fun, sexy, and exciting! This is why we go to the movies.",10,0,0,18 February 2006
Wanted," A 14 Year Old Boy's Wet Dream
","'Wanted' is basically a sex/violence fantasy for adolescent boys. A nerdy cubicle worker is recruited by ultra sexy Angelina Jolie and becomes a super assassin.Thankfully, this film is saved by doses of humor that make the predictable plot and thin story bearable.James McAvoy is surprisingly good, speaking with a perfect American accent. Angelina is scary sexy as the femme fatale assassin recruiter. Morgan Freeman practically sleepwalks through his role, but is still enjoyable.The story is completely ridiculous. One of the main plot points involves binary code weaved into textiles. Another thing that happens is during shootouts, they prevent themselves from being shot by shooting the bullet that is coming towards them.If you like seeing slow motion close-ups of people being shot in the head, then 'Wanted' is the movie for you.",6,21,47,5 July 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Should Have Neutered This Virgin
","If being vulgar were the same as being funny, this would have been a funny film. Instead, it comes off like something some naughty high school boys made up.I was able to put up with the juvenile sex and vomit jokes, but the racial jokes were the most offensive. Of course, if there had been anything actually funny it would have made up for it.I didn't think Steve Carrel was a very likable character and I never really cared about him or rooted for him. The directing is like a made for TV skit. I think the choice of songs was supposed to be funny, but I can't be sure.If I hadn't read the reviews, I would think only teenagers would like this film. This is the worst film I have seen this year!",2,6,13,10 September 2005
She's the Man," More Like 'Tootsie,' Less Like Shakespeare
","'She's the Man' is decent for a teenage comedy, but it has very little to do with Shakespeare. The only thing it has in common with 'Twelfth Night' is the names of the characters.Amanda Bynes plays the cross-dresser of the title in a twitchy manner, similar to Dustin Hoffman in 'Tootsie.' In many ways, 'She's the Man' is like 'Tootsie' for young girls. Lots of the professional reviewers seemed oblivious to the fact that the main joke of the movie is that Viola never really looks or sounds like a man, but she is able to fool everyone in the movie anyway. While the movie is not rolling-in-the-aisles funny, it has a fair share of chuckles and is perfectly unoffensive.'She's the Man' has no originality and is perfectly predicable, but if you are looking for some light entertainment, it is probably the best thing in the theaters right now.",7,0,0,25 March 2006
Jarhead," War is Dull (So is this Film)
","Sam Mendes does not make many films so when he does, expectations are high. 'Jarhead' is a highly critical look at the United States Marine Corps based on a book by a slacker ex-Marine. Apparently Sam Mendes, a Briton, does not like the Marines.This film might say more about a non-American's view of the American military than anything else. At one point in the film the narrator says 'We are all insane...,' pauses, then finishes the sentence. That pretty much sums up the entire film and for 2 hours we watch what idiots these people are. There are no likable or sympathetic characters in the entire film.Overall, this does not make for a very entertaining film. The first 10 minutes are pretty funny but after that it gets to be the same thing over and over.The film is not very original and there are several references to older, better films about the United States military. Like some of those other films, this one uses substantial use of pop music of the time period depicted in the film and it gets really annoying if you don't like that type of music. The film is noisy despite no actual combat scenes.The acting and photography are first rate. If you are a Chris Cooper fan, he is in the movie for only about 2 minutes.Many Americans are going to hate this film because of the way it depicts the United States Marine Corps. I didn't like it because it was dull,annoying, and derivative.",3,1,4,4 November 2005
Collateral," Yin, Yang, and I Ching
","Collateral is part action thriller and part high concept, existentialist psychological drama.  As a thriller, it works okay but for me the best parts are when they are sitting around in the taxi talking.  This is one of the rare films where someone put a lot of thought into the script before turning it into a film.  Who would of thought that Stuart Beattie, who wrote one of the Mummy scripts, could actually write an intelligent (dare I say intellectual) script?Vincent is the epitome of evil but he justifies himself to Max and in some regards, he is right.  Vincent might be evil but he is a doer.  Max is a dreamer.  Max is always trying to do the right thing but given a choice, he would just as well keep things the way they are.  Max needs everything to be perfect while Vincent likes to improvise.  Because they are opposites, they need each other.  Neither man seems to have much intimacy in their life and they seem intent on trying to convince the other on the legitimacy of their views.   Upon first viewing, you are caught up in the thriller part of the story and it's hard to notice the nuances and symbolism.  On subsequent viewings you can pay more attention to the psychological details and surreal elements. For instance, at one point Max actually becomes Vincent.  In several parts of the film, Vincent is helping Max and acts as sort of a malevolent benefactor.  It is at these levels of the film that make it so special.  The film also has some genuinely funny moments; it does not take itself too seriously.Los Angeles late at night is an eerie, seductive and beautiful place and the filmmakers capture it well.  The action parts are adequate but it is the quiet passages that make this film special.  The acting, script, photography, music, and directing are all first rate.  It works well as a thriller but is even better as a psychological drama.  I consider this an instant classic.  10/10.",10,1,3,29 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," Boring and Repulsive
","I really hated 'No Country for Old Men.' I had put off seeing it because it didn't look like it was going to be very good, but I was eventually taken in by all the rave reviews and the high rating on IMDb. Not only was it not very good, it was much worse than my worst expectations.I had expected a lot of brutal violence and it delivered on that point. What I hadn't expected was that it was going to be so mindlessly boring.There is only a minimal plot. The characters are all one-dimensional and nobody is likable. There are multiple plot holes, some which defy all logic. And I don't understand how anybody could be happy with the ending, which does not resolve anything that happened before it.I don't always agree with film critics or popular taste in movies but 'No Country for Old Men' sets a new standard. If I hadn't seen the horrible Lindsey Lohan movie, 'I Know Who Killed Me,' this would have been the worst movie I had seen all year.",2,18,35,25 January 2008
Batman Begins," Best Superhero Comic Book Movie Ever!
","I usually do not like comic book movies.Batman Begins is a serious, no-nonsense comic book movie, that is geared more towards adults than children. The PG-13 rating in the States did not stop a lot of parents from bringing their under 10 year-olds to this very dark and long film.I don't know if very young children have the attention span for this type of film. I suspect they will get fidgety for the first hour or so while Bruce Wayne searches for his inner Bat. The last hour of the film is your typical comic book fair with plenty of fighting and chasing.The supporting cast is astounding! You've got Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, and Michael Caine. With all those great actors, the one who steals the film is someone I've never heard of before, Cillian Murphy, who plays the creepiest villain in the film.The leads, on the other hand, lack presence and personality.Unlike the previous Batman films, there are not a bunch of silly villains. The villains in this Batman are serious and viable, which make them seem more dangerous than the previous films.This is the best superhero comic film I've seen! I liked it more than last year's Spiderman.The director uses a great technique for bringing the viewer into the fight scenes. By shooting up close and doing quick cuts, you get a sense of what it is like for Batman's victims because they never see what hits them. This is a menacing, creepy, Batman. The visuals and art direction are better than the original.But after all is said and done, it is still a comic book movie.",8,3,5,19 June 2005
Before Sunset," Intelligent and Thought Provoking
","As you probably already know, this film is a dialog between two people who had a one-night stand 9 years previous. I had not seen the first film but Before Sunset is probably as fine a film you will ever see that involves nothing but two people talking.There is no drama, no action, and no special effects. These two people open up to each other unequivocally and talk about life, love, and desire. There is no resolution at the end. These people are in their early thirties and are still too young to understand everything in life but they still have optimism and ideals,along with disappointment. The dialog is intelligent and thought provoking; two thing that are conspicuously missing from movies these days. This alone is worth the price of admission.This is not a cinematic film and you have to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate it but if you are, it is very rewarding. This is a film about what really matters in our lives. 9/10",9,0,0,3 September 2004
The Pianist," A Film Everyone Should See
","I almost did not see `The Pianist' because I am squeamish and I was afraid I would not be able to sit through the Nazi atrocities on the screen. 
I am very glad I saw this film.  While it does have it's share of horrible violence, that is not the emphasis.  Instead it is a movie about survival during adversity.Another reason I almost did not see this film is because Roman Polanski has not make a good film in over 20 years.  `The Pianist' is his masterpiece, overshadowing his successful films from over 20 years ago.I am very disappointed at the Motion Picture Guild giving this film an `R' rating.  With all the gratuitous violence in PG-13 movies and on television these days I do not think this film deserved an `R' rating.
Not only do I think this film is suitable for persons under 17; I think they should show this film to high school students as part of their education.This is a film that everyone should see.  It is one of the best films of the year and will be considered a classic in the years to come.",10,0,1,30 January 2003
The Number 23," Poor Script Ruins a Promising Concept
","Before going to see The Number 23, I had read all the negative reviews, but the preview looked so good, I went to see it anyway. For 2/3 of the film, I thought the film was pretty good. The last third is so preposterous, it really ruined the film. I left the theater feeling cheated.You would think that Jim Carrey, Virgina Madsen, and both their agents would have told them the script needed to be fixed. Besides the really stupid ending, the attempts at humor are really lame. Everything that is wrong with this film could have been fixed before they started filming. It's hard to believe anyone could have read the script and thought this would be a successful movie. It's a shame, because this could have been a really good film.",4,4,19,23 February 2007
The Mist," Stay Out of 'The Mist'
","'The Mist' is not an especially bad film, but it offers nothing that hasn't been done many times before and is nothing special.This is a run of the mill, 'B' horror film. The monsters are good but the characters are bad. The director does not seem to be able to make up his mind whether he wants to make this campy or if he wants to play it straight up. While there are a couple of funny parts, this is mostly not scary and none of the characters are likable. Thomas Jane is not really a movie star and he cannot carry the film.If you liked 'The Host' and 'Slithers,' you might like this film more than I did. Otherwise, avoid 'The Mist.'",4,4,13,2 December 2007
Stardust," 'Stardust' Has Magic
","'Stardust' gets off to a slow start but about halfway through it gets significantly better.It starts out with lead characters that are whiny and not very likable. But that is all part of the plot. About halfway through the film, the characters grow and become more likable.The lead actors are okay, but it is really Michelle Pfeiffer that saves the film. Her evil witch is hilarious. Robert De Niro gives one of his funniest performances ever as a pirate.Overall, 'Stardust' is better than the majority of sequels out this summer. If you are willing to overlook the flaws of the first half, you are likely to have a good time. It gives you everything you could want from a fantasy film. It has kings, princes, a princess, pirates, and a cannibalistic witch. It might be too dark for children, but adults will surely like it.",7,2,5,10 August 2007
Hero," This is the film Troy should have been
","Ying xiong (Hero) is the film that Troy should have been.  The thing that makes Hero a great movie is the cinematic style rather than the story. Yimou Zhang is a director with a vision on how the film should look and like our dreams, the images prove to be more powerful than the narrative.Like Troy, this is an epic film set in the past, full of legendary characters.  Troy told it's story by filming its' actors reciting their lines.  Hero, on the other hand, develops exquisite images that linger in the mind and burns the legend into our subconscious.  If Yimou Zhang were to come to Hollywood and have $180 million budgets, image that masterpieces he could make.I didn't care for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Compared to Hero, it is a pretender while Hero is the real thing.  I generally avoid foreign language films but Hero is my favorite foreign language film of all time.  The story is pretty simple and people who put more importance on the story over the style will probably be disappointed.  This is my 3rd favorite film of the year behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Collateral.  It is better than anything that played in the theaters in 2003. 9/10",10,0,0,28 August 2004
The Hurt Locker," Presented in Shaky-Vision
","I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. 'The Hurt Locker' has won more 'Best Picture' awards from the critic groups than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it hard to sit through.There is minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. That is the entire movie. But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it. The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.I normally don't care for war movies and 'The Hurt Locker' was no exception. But you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it.",2,253,472,13 February 2010
The Illusionist," Popcorn Flick for Adults
","'The Illusionist' is an enjoyable diversion. It is ultimately escapist fluff, but finally there is a fun film that is geared towards an adult audience rather than children and teenagers.The acting is first class. Edward Norton is good but somewhat stiff as the lead character. Paul Giamatti actually has the most screen time and it could be argued that he is really the protagonist of the story.The photography, music, and the script are all first rate. I thought the ending was predictable, but I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way.After a Summer of children's film and a Fall full of disappointments, 'The Illusionist' is a film that actually delivers the goods. Make sure to see it!",9,3,4,24 September 2006
Million Dollar Baby," It's Still a Boxing Movie
","I hate boxing. The only thing I hate more than boxing is movies about boxing. The only reason I went to see Million Dollar Baby was that it was the only one of the Best Picture nominees that I hadn't seen and there was nothing else playing.The good news is that for a boxing movie, it is first rate. It ranks up there with Requiem for a Heavyweight and Raging Bull. The technical quality is great. It has a decent script, good acting, and a surprisingly atmospheric soundtrack.Film critic Roger Ebert defended this movie by saying it not about boxing, it is about people. While that is true to a point, a lot of this film is about boxing and a large chunk of this film shows people boxing. The first 2/3 of the film is almost like Rocky except the acting and dialog is much better. The professional film critics have all agreed not to talk about the last third of the film except to say 'it takes a dark turn.' If you don't like depressing films, you should skip this one.Overall, I gave this film a 8/10 rating. It's really good but it's a downer and it's a boxing movie.",8,2,4,5 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," More Interesting Than Entertaining
","'Good Night and Good Luck' is an interesting film re-enacting the feud between Edward R. Murrow and Joseph McCarthy. It is a part of American history I had heard about but was not familiar with the details.Unfortunately, it isn't the most entertaining subject in the world. Most of the film consist of a bunch of people sitting around talking and smoking. There isn't much depth to the characters. All we really know about them is that they want to do what they think is right.The photography, acting, and directing is all really good. George Clooney has a surprisingly good eye and creative ways to use the camera. At 93 minutes, it seems like they didn't have enough story to fill the time slot so they added some filler to stretch it out; although I liked the segments with Dianne Reeves.'Good Night and Good Luck' is a decent, but somewhat overrated film.",6,4,7,11 November 2005
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drive's secrets unveiled (SPOILERS)
","Unlike most films, Mulholland Drive needs to be interpreted like a novel rather than just watched. To be sure, there are events that take place; but the significance and context of those events are what makes this film mean different things to different people. I will try to explain the three most popular interpretations.1. The easiest and most common interpretation is that the first part of the film is a dream, and the last half hour is reality. Before the opening credits, we see a montage of Betty with the elderly couple, then the jitterbug sequence, then some red bed sheets and pillow. The bed sheets and pillow signify that what we are about to see is a dream. In the dream, Rita gets amnesia after a car crash and she is helped by her friend Betty. Betty is smart, pretty, confident, and a talented actress. In trying to find out Rita's true identity, they fall in love. But then the dream turns to a nightmare as they go to a club called Silencio, where Betty comes into possession of a blue box which Rita has the key that opens it. When the dream is over, we find out the dreamer is Diane, who played the role of Betty in the dream. Her ex-lover Camilla was Rita in the dream. In this reality, Diane is not successful or confident, but Camilla is the stunning and successful one. Camilla has ended their relationship, so out of jealousy and envy, Diane pays a hit-man to kill her. After the murder, she is overcome with guilt and kills herself.2. In this interpretation, both the women are dead but do not realize it. There have been a couple of movies in the last few years to use this sort of plot device. Diane's dream of the first part of the movie is a dream within a dream. You will notice that all the plot threads start while Rita is sleeping. It is because it is her dream also. The elderly couple with Betty before the opening credits are her companions on her plane trip. They represent spirits of the netherworld. At the end of the movie they take her back. At Silencio, they see a singer die on stage, but they can still hear her voice. This is symbolic of them realizing they are dead but still conscience. The blue box represents the soul. Rita has the key, but she needs Betty in order to get the blue box. Once she opens the blue box, she is transported to where people go when they die. After that, Diane wakes up and thinks she has been dreaming. Virtually all of the last half hour of the movie is either flashback or delusion. Betty's blue box is owned by the evil person behind the coffee shop, placed in a wrinkled paper bag like it was garbage. The guardians of the netherworld chase after Betty. Betty escapes by killing herself. There is a montage at the end where Betty and Rita are together. This could mean that Camilla has forgiven her and they are together in the afterlife.3. The two women are the same person or one is an alter-ego of the other. There have been a couple of films in the past year to use this plot device also. One of the important parts in this interpretation is that Diane is told she will find a blue key when the murder is done. But in the dream it is Rita who has the key and the money. In the first part of the movie, Rita is the dreamer and Betty is the alter-ego. After she wakes up, Diane is real and Camilla is the alter-ego. The alter-ego is always the successful and talented one. The montage at the end where the two women are together signifies that the duel personalities have consolidated.I realize I did not go into a lot of detail to argue for any of these interpretations, but if you watch the film closely, you will find things to support each interpretation. I believe all three are equally valid but I do not know which one David Lynch intended. Not that it matters. If you have seen Mulholland Drive, but did not really understand it, then I encourage you to see it again with these things in mind and pay close attention to the details.",10,1,1,27 October 2001
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Best Film of 2004
","2004 was a very good year for films and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind stands out as the best.I am not a big Charlie Kaufman fan, but his screenplay is the star of this film. I read the original draft on his website and the changes that were made really made a big difference in the final product.Unlike his other films that seemed to be all concept and have very little humanity, Eternal Sunshine is about the people. Ultimately love conquers all, just like in the movies.I saw this film 4 times in the theater and I bought the DVD. As always, the small screen does not do the film justice. The 2-disc collectors edition has a few more deleted scenes, but it does not add that much to the film.This is a very special film. With most of today's films being remakes and recycled ideas, this film is the most original in years. This is one of my all time favorites!",10,1,3,15 May 2005
Grindhouse," Part Comedy and Part Tribute
","The professional critics mostly concluded that 'Death Proof' was the better of the two films. User comments on IMDb mostly like 'Planet Terror' the best. Why the disparity?'Planet Terror' and the four fake trailers are all strictly comedies. They are parodies of films and trailers of the 70's and they are really funny.Then 'Death Proof' comes along and it is not funny at all. It is trying to re-create a 70's movie, not make fun of it.Rose McGowen is great in both films, but she is not in the second one long enough.'Planet Terror' - 9/10 Trailers - 10/10 'Death Proof' - 4/10",7,1,7,13 April 2007
The Artist," More of a Novelty
","'The Artist' is more of a novelty than a film. The fact that it is silent didn't bother me as much as the predictable story, hammy acting, and 16mm square format film. It's not a bad film but I didn't feel it was worth all the rave reviews and I certainly don't feel it should be a contender for Best Picture.The story is very predictable. I always felt I was 2 steps ahead of the script and I was bored for much of the film. I wish the cinematography had been a little fancier to offset the lack of sound. It didn't look like it was shot in real black and white. It looked like it was shot in color and transferred to black and white which gives it a muddy look. The music was pretty good. My favorite character was the dog.If you want to see a good silent film, my favorites are 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' and 'City Lights.' I don't really recommend 'The Artist' except as a novelty.",4,7,21,8 January 2012
Mission: Impossible," No redeeming qualities
","There is nothing good about this movie.  The television show had a format. This movie takes the name of the show, but does not follow the format at all.  The television show was fun, but this movie is slow and boring and has no likeable characters.  I do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television show.",1,19,33,5 August 2000
National Treasure," Raiders of the Lost National Treasure
","I'm not sure why the critics gave 'National Treasure' such a bad time. It's not a very original movie, but it is very well made and it's not a sequel.For me, the best thing was the script, which is well thought out and does not carry any excess baggage. The film follows a typical formula. There's the scruffy hero, the goofy sidekick, the pretty blonde, and the despicable bad guy. The visual style is similar to the TV show, CSI. It looks slick, and the pace never drags.I typically don't care for Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger is not a very good actress. The filmmakers felt they had to explain her character's accent, which makes it stand out all that much more. Also, she wears more makeup than most 28 year olds. I guess there's a shortage of young, pretty blondes in Hollywood right now. The supporting cast is top-notch.This is a silly, brainless movie, but it is a lot of fun. 7/10",7,1,2,12 December 2004
The Descent," Duped by the Reviews Again
","I usually do not like gory horror films but 'The Descent' got pretty good reviews from the professional critics so I thought I would give it a try. It turned out to be a total waste of time and money.The production quality is much lower than what we are accustomed to in mainstream American films. The photography is fuzzy and the sound is distorted. The first hour is about a woman's personal tragedy and a group of women who go cave crawling. This part of the film is not made very well and is pretty boring. The monsters are pretty good, but they do not come in till very late in the film and by that point I was already bored to death.If you like gory horror films, you might like 'The Descent' better than I did. If you are planning to see it, you might want to skip the first hour.",3,3,6,6 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," Not very original
","It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.",2,38,81,19 February 2001
Titanic," Masterpiece Theater Meets The Poseidon Adventure
","I finally saw Titanic when it was on network television last week. I had been avoiding it because I didn't think I would like it. I hadn't liked any of James Cameron's other films and I didn't think I would be able to make it through the entire 3 hours. The first half was like a Merchant-Ivory production and it was much better than I expected. The second half was basically a remake of the Poseidon Adventure and it was pretty much what I expected.My favorite part of the film did not involve any of the lead characters. It was when the boat was about to sink and the string quartet had finished their last piece of music. They said their goodbyes and started walking away, then the violinist started playing solo. The other members came back and joined him. This part of the film showed that the musicians knew they had nowhere else to go because they were going to die. While most of the other passengers were panicking, the musicians chose to die doing what they loved most.That one touching scene made the movie worthwhile for me. While I don't consider it a great film and it is way too long, it is much better than I ever thought James Cameron was capable of. 7/10",9,2,3,26 September 2004
The Fountain," Flawed Masterpiece
","'The Fountain' is unlike any other film ever made. When a director takes this many chances, he is going to alienate a lot of people. But if you want to see something original, this is the film to see.If you have seen the other films of Darren Aronofsky, you know he never does anything halfway. This is a film of excesses and vision. If the story makes any sense at all, it is a bonus. If 'The Fountain' is actually coherent, you will need to use your imagination.In some ways, this is Aronofsky's most assessable film because it is about undying love. On the other hand, it is not linear and could lose a lot of people. The ending is open to interpretation and a lot of people are just not going to get it.Performances and photography are great. Visually it reminds me of the David Lynch version of 'Dune.' The music was okay but could have been better. The film would have been better if they had gotten Phillip Glass.I question the studio's decision to release this in wide release during the Fall holiday season. This is clearly not a movie for the masses. This film really belongs in the art houses.If you like experimental cinema, you are likely to embrace 'The Fountain.' If you need movies to explain everything at the end, you should probably skip it.",10,3,6,25 November 2006
The Departed," A Departure From the Original
","First of all, 'The Departed' is not as good as the film it was based on, 'Infernal Affairs,' which is one of the best Asian films of all time. Still, 'The Departed' is good entertainment in it's own rite.The first 2/3 of 'The Departed' does not follow the original very much. It is mostly background information about the characters and while at times it is amusing, it is also sometimes boring. This film is about an hour too long. But once you get to the last hour, it is one of the most entertaining films of the year.The last part of the film follows the original pretty faithfully and turns a mediocre film into a very good one.Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career. Matt Damon is the weakest link in the film. He is okay, but does not convey the complexity of the same character in the original film. Jack Nicholson gives a grizzled version of the character that he played in 'Witches of Eastwick.' The supporting cast is full of actors that are used to being the stars and they are great! The acting is alone is worth the price of admission.The biggest difference between 'The Departed' and 'Infernal Affairs' is that the remake is much more violent and has many obvious attempts at humor, while the original was fully serious and much more subtle.While it doesn't fully live up to the original, 'The Departed' is first rate entertainment if you can stomach the extreme violence and obscenity. If you are looking for a first rate adult popcorn flick, 'The Departed' can be a good diversion.",7,1,3,7 October 2006
Psycho," What makes it great
","I normally do not like horror films, but this is a perfect example of how style and craftsmanship can overcome what is basically a mediocre script.The thing that really makes this movie for me is the way it is filmed and the way the music is used throughout the film.  The visual style can compete with 'Vertigo' as Hitchcock at his most artsy.  SPOILER:  Another innovative technique is leading up to the 'shower scene,' Janet Leigh is in every scene and almost every shot.  The movie is about her and it is being shown from her point of view.  Then we have the famous 'shower scene' and suddenly the movie is no longer about her; it is about Norman Bates.  Hitchcock makes this transition with such incredible ease that there is no loss of coherence.This movie is a real work of art.  What is even more incredible is that Hitchcock was able to make something so artsy, yet make it appeal to a wide audience.  That is the tightrope that today's film makers do not seem able to walk.",10,0,0,9 September 2001
War of the Worlds," Deadbeat Dad Finds Redemption
","I had liked Spielberg's last 3 films, so this one comes as a bit of a disappointment. It is just like Jurrasic Park except with space invaders instead of dinosaurs.This film has many attributes. The photography and music are great. Dakota Fanning gives a wonderful performance. But when all is said and done, much of the film was boring and the ending left a lot to be desired.It is basically a story of a lousy father who gains redemption by hiding his kids from the space invaders. The only problem with this is that if there are no space invaders, then how are the lousy fathers supposed to make up for it?",6,3,16,2 July 2005
Love Actually," Depends on you musical taste
","I agree with all the other comments that some of the stories are better than others and some are not very good at all.  The thing that really bothered me was the music.  Throughout the film, there is loud 'soft rock' music from the 70's and 80's.  If you like that sort of music, it won't bother you.  I don't like that sort of music so I found it detracting from the stories.If they had cut about 30 minutes from the film it would have been better. There is quite a bit of good stuff here but also a lot of junk. Overall, I gave it a 6/10.",6,0,1,9 November 2003
Wedding Crashers," Sweet and Vulgar
","'Wedding Crashers' is the quintessential 21st century comedy. It acts like it is really raunchy but in the end it is as sweet as a 1930's Ginger Rogers romantic comedy.It is much better than I would have thought from seeing the advertisements. In most comedies these days, the ads give away the best jokes. This one saves them for the film.I'm not much of a fan of Vince Vaughn or Owen Wilson but the supporting cast saves the film. Rachael McAdams steals every scene she is in and is worth the price of admission. Christopher Walken plays a role reminiscent of Meet the Parents. Artie Johnson looks the same as he did 25 years ago in Laugh-in.I also appreciated that the film did not rely on doing the same jokes over and over. It appears they actually put some thought in the script, a rarity these days.If you liked 'Meet the Fockers' and 'Dodgeball,' you will probably like 'Wedding Crashers.'",7,2,5,15 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Why are critics such suckers?
","I think it is amazing that 'There Will Be Blood' and 'No Country for Old Men' are two of the most boring and repulsive movies I have seen this year or any year, and they are the two films that have gotten the best reviews from movie critics this year.The pacing of 'There Will Be Blood' is very slow. None of the characters are likable, so I could never get interested in what happened to them.Daniel Day Lewis' character is similar to the one he played in 'Gangs of New York,' but that movie was more interesting because he was evil in contrast to the other characters. In this film, he has more in common with his rival and the film is mostly about how they are the same.'There Will Be Blood' was a very hard movie to sit through. Things happen very slowly and when they do happen, they are unpleasant. If that sounds like the kind of movie you like, then you might agree with the critics on this one.",2,12,28,3 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Never Believe a Sith
","While 'Revenge of the Sith' is much better than the last two Star Wars, it is not as good as the first 3. And like the last two, the missing element is that the characters lack personality. But 'Revenge of the Sith' makes a big improvement because the characters show more emotion and therefore we care more about them more.The last two lacked a villain with any charisma. This one has Darth Sideous who we saw briefly in 'Return of the Jedi.' There are three valuable lessons to be learned from the film. 1-Never believe anything a Sith lord says to you, because they lie. 2-Even though you might go to the dark side for all the right reasons, it's still a bad idea because the dark side makes you go nuts. 3-Never elect a Sith president. They will start wars so they have an excuse to take away your freedom.The special effects are decent, but nothing we haven't seen before. The fight scenes are not as good as some recent Chinese films. The music is great, as always.It's a shame that George Lucas made parts 1 and 2, because they tarnish the series of Star Wars and don't really add much. Part 3 stands up to the integrity of the first 3 films and fills in all the gaps from the original 3 films.The first hour is pretty slow, but after that the film really picks up in intensity. The art direction is much improved also. This is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen in order to be fully appreciated.",8,2,5,21 May 2005
Ray," The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Ray Charles
","Ray is beautifully filmed and acted. While it does not go into details about the entire life of Ray Charles, it concentrates of his development as a musician and songwriter and the subsequent rise to fame. It also details the ugly parts of that rise to fame; being unfaithful to his wife and his heroin addiction.Ray is an extraordinary story that is adeptly told. All the acting, directing, and editing are done with a lot of attention to detail. This was obviously a labor of love and not just an attempt to make a few bucks. I was not a Ray Charles film before I saw this film and I probably will not buy any of his records, but this is a first-rate film and I highly recommend it. 10/10",10,1,2,6 November 2004
Lord of War," Lord of Bore
","'Lord of War' is a very well made film. There really isn't much wrong with it, except I never really cared about the subject matter or any of the characters.The ad for this film is a bit deceiving, in that it makes it look like it is a comedy. There are a few funny one liners, but most of those are used in the ad. The film is steeped in sarcasm, which is sometimes funny, but in the end the film is kind of depressing and tries to make a serious point about the world's munitions distribution.Nicolas Cage plays a munitions supplier with a personality of a door to door salesman. He has no morals and justifies his profession by saying that 'somebody has to do it.' The only likable character in the film is the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, but he is only in the film for about 10 minutes.I would have liked this film a lot more if the lead character was more sympathetic. Because of that, it was hard to really care what happened to him. Still, this is not a bad film and it does have wit and sarcasm on a serious issue.",6,4,9,18 September 2005
The Terminal," Spielberg Channels Capra
","I have never been much of a Spielberg fan.  His most popular and his most acclaimed films did not do much for me but his last 3 films, including The Terminal, has changed my mind.  The Terminal might be Spielberg's most human film to date.  I thought it was very funny and the characters did not rely on cliches.  The style of this film harks back to the days when you could not always count on a Hollywood ending.  I think that is why so many people were disappointed.  If the film ended the way of most Hollywood films, then people would be complaining about how predictable it was.  Also, many critics are complaining about excessive product placement.  The movie takes place in an airlines terminal.  The people who are doing the complaining are not giving suggestions on how not to have name brand products in this type of setting.  It would seem to be unavoidable.This film is funny and sentimental. So far, this is my favorite movie of the Summer!  9/10",9,1,2,20 June 2004
1408," 1408: A Portal into HELL
","'1408' is the best horror film to come out in several years. Unlike most horror films these days, it does not rely on gore and you don't leave the theater wanting to get your money back because you were cheated at the end. Some people may not like the ending but I thought it was like a good episode of 'The Twilight Zone.'The thing I liked best about '1408' was that it is not just another haunted house. It is a customized portal into Hell that is made specifically for the inhabitant, in this case John Cusak. Also, the film has it's share of humor. The possessed clock radio in the room only plays The Carpenters. That must be Stephen King's idea of Hell.If you have any inclination to see this film, you need to see it on the big screen. It is not going to translate well onto video. It stays away from the cheap tricks of other horror films and develops a creepy story instead. If you liked 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge,' you will probably like '1408.'",8,40,62,22 June 2007
Blade Runner," Existential Sci-Fi Noir
","When I first saw this in it's initial theatrical release, I was too young to appreciate it. This is one of the few films that has gotten better through the years. It was way ahead of it's time and groundbreaking in starting the Sci-Fi Noir genre.I strongly prefer the 'director's cut' version because it does not condescend to the viewer, and lets the viewer interpret the film for their selves. For instance, in the original version the narration speculates that Roy saved Deckard's life because he valued life so much. My interpretation is that Roy just did not want to die alone. The symbolism of the dove flying away when Roy dies is truly beautiful.The cinematography and music is just as important as the story in this film. Without this film, there would have never been 'Total Recall,' 'Dark City,' or 'The Matrix.' All those films deal with the possibility of memory implants and question our concept of who we are.This is a film I can watch over and over and find new meaning.",10,0,1,29 May 2005
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," An Adult Popcorn Movie
","Don't believe the poor reviews 'Elizebeth: The Golden Age' has received.While it may be true the film is not historically correct, most of us do not go to the movies for a history lesson. We go to be entertained. On that basis, this film is a winner. It has romance, intrigue and betrayal. It is basically a melodrama.The photography is great, although sometimes the director gets carried away with the camera movements. The orchestral score in fine, although it is overwhelming at times. The acting is absolutely first rate.I thought that 'Elizebeth: The Golden Age' was more entertaining than any of the 'Pirates of the Carribian' movies. If you want an entertaining movie that is geared more towards adults than children, then you should check the movie out.",7,133,227,12 October 2007
Munich," Most Depressing Film of the Year
","'Munich is a really well made film with an admirable message that both the terrorists and assassins are not so different from one another. It is also the most depressing film I've seen in several years.The film starts with the kidnapping and killing of the Israeli athletes, then it gets bleaker as the film progresses. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is pretty unpleasant to sit through and left me in a pretty grim mood for the rest of the day.The production quality and acting is excellent throughout.'Munich' is a good film with a good message, but not everyone should see it. This is the most depressing film I've seen since 'The Pianist,' but I thought 'The Pianist' was a better film.'Munich' is not for the faint of heart.",7,1,6,31 December 2005
Sin City," Should have been NC-17
","'Sin City' is the most violent movie I have ever seen. Even though the splattered blood and cut off limbs look like they came out of of video game, I still think this film should have been rated NC-17. There is no reason any children should be seeing this film. There is also lots of gratuitous nudity.Despite that, I liked the film. In this day where I often forget what movies I've seen because they are so forgettable, this is one I won't forget. It looks different than any other film I've seen. The closest would be 'Sky Captain,' but 'Sin City' has much better stories.The 3 stories all follow the Noir formula. The tough loner with a soft spot for a dame in trouble stops at nothing to save the damsel in distress. The protagonists may be anti-social, but they have integrity.Because of the stunning visuals, you should see this one while it is still in the theaters.",8,1,2,10 April 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," A Mainstream Art House Film
","The visual style of this film is similar to 21 Grams.  It uses a lot of hand held camera and grainy film.  It adds to that a lot of very fast edits and some pretty good music.  I saw this shortly after seeing I, Robot which I had been expecting to be more in the style of the other films by Alex Proyas like Dark City and The Crow but I was disappointed that it was just another Will Smith film.The story is pretty simple and straight forward with no real big surprises but if you are looking for something with style, The Bourne Supremacy is one of the better flicks for the summer.",9,3,3,25 July 2004
The Proposal," Everything You Want in a Rom-Com
","Breaking news: The Proposal is not going to win any Academy Awards. It is predicable and follows the Rom-Com formula you have seen a hundred times before. Despite that, The Proposal is an enjoyable film and one of the better Rom-Coms to come out in the past few years.Sandra Bullock has the difficult task of being an uptight b**** but still remains a likable character. Ryan Reynolds shows he is a master at the awkward facial expression. Most of the big laughs are from Betty White, who practically steals the film.'The Proposal' probably won't have you rolling with laughter, but it is an enjoyable diversion. If you go see it, chances are that you will be happy you went.",7,43,89,20 June 2009
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Turns into a Pumpkin
","I hate boxing movies.The only thing I hate more than boxing movies, is boxing and boxers.Having said that, Cinderella Man is a very well made film. It is worth seeing for the acting and directing alone. Russell Crowe and Rene Zellweger give good performances, but they are pretty much what we expect from them. Paul Giamatti gives a great performance in a supporting role that outshines the stars. Ron Howard does the best directing job of his career.I hadn't seen an uplifting depression era film since Seabiscuit. I hadn't seen an underdog boxing film since Million Dollar Baby. Both those films are better than Cinderella Man.Cinderella Man starts off being more about the people trying to survive the Great Depression but ends with a long extended fight scene and I left the theater feeling like I just saw a remake of Rocky.Despite all of it's attributes, Cinderella Man does not have enough originality to make it a great film. Still, it's a nice film to see in the summer because it is one of the few films geared towards adults instead of children.",7,2,8,4 June 2005
Atonement," Daring and Challenging for a Mainstream Film
","I had put off seeing 'Atonement' because it looked like so many epic romance films that came before it.I was pleasantly surprised. This is a film that takes a lot of chances. First and foremost is the narrative structure. Some of the scenes are shown out of sequence. Some of the scenes are shown twice and from different points of view. And some scenes, we later find out, never really happened.For the most part, we are not told any of this, so you really have to pay attention and think about what is going on. Unlike most films these day, you cannot passively watch this film.In addition, the film is carried by young Saoirse Ronan who dominates the screen whenever she is on. The other actors are good, but Miss Ronan's performance is really special.The directing also takes a lot of chances with lots of close ups and camera angles. The music is memorable and incorporates a typewriter as a musical instrument. It reminds me a lot of the film music of Phillip Glass.If you have been avoiding 'Atonement' because you thought you had seen it all before, think again. This is one of the most daring and experimental mainstream films to come out in a long time.",9,3,4,1 February 2008
V for Vendetta," A Dark, Cerebral, Non-action, Thriller
","Undoubtedly, there are people who are not going to like 'V For Vendetta' because they were expecting non-stop action and special effects like the 'Matrix' trilogy.Fortunately, 'V For Vedetta' is really a comic book for adults. The thrills are cerebral rather than visceral. The story is dialog heavy and you need to pay close attention to what people are saying.The advertisements for this film were a bit misleading because they make it look like your run of the mill comic book fantasy, but it is really much more. This is a film for adults who are interested in story and ideas. Warning: If you ever considered Bill O'Reily or Rush Lindbaugh to have a worthwhile idea, do not see this film! You will find it offensive. This is a film that glamorizes people who fight for freedom and rights for the individual.Instead of a bunch of gratuitous special effects, the film is heavy on mood and set design. There is very good use of music, especially Tchaikovsky's '1812 Overture.' The acting is good, especially Natalie Portman, who continues to build an impressive portfolio of good performances.If you are looking for non-stop action, you will not like this film. If you like films with lots of atmosphere and dialog, 'V For Vendetta' might be your kind of thriller.",10,4,10,18 March 2006
The Island," Anatomy of a Flop
","After 2 weeks of release, The Island looks like it will probably the biggest flop of 2005. Where did they go wrong? 1. The director, Michael Bay, specializes in mindless action films like Bad Boys and The Rock. Letting him make a film that actually has a plot was a big mistake. The directing is sloppy and does not have much thought. While that works for lots of films, it does not go well with science fiction.2. There were no well known actors in the film. Ewan McGregor is a decent actor, but he does not have the presence to carry a film. Scarlett Johanson has done very well in quirky independent films, but she is terrible in this action film.3. The script is poor, despite an interesting premise. The dialog was so dull, I cannot remember a single line. The mindless chase scenes got boring and were not credible. 4. There was about 10 minutes in the middle that had a few jokes, but otherwise this film was done with a straight face. It wasn't good enough to be a serious film and it wasn't fun enough to make it as a popcorn flick.If 'The Island' keeps it's place as the biggest flop of 2005, it serves the movie studio right for not putting any thought into such a big budget film.",4,3,6,31 July 2005
Semi-Pro," Semi-Pro is Totally Pathetic
","I like R rated comedies as much as the next guy if they are funny, but there is nothing funny in this one.'Semi-Pro' plays like a PG-13 film that was unfunny that the producers decided to add a bunch of foul language in a desperate attempt to get laughs.The problem is that it is not funny and it is painful to watch talented people like Will Farrell, Will Arnet, and Woody Harrelson slog their way through this terrible script. Didn't anyone read the script before they starting shooting? This film is an embarrassment to everyone involved.This film is a total waste of time. It is not even worth a rental. And when it comes on video, make sure to keep it away from the kids. This film fails to realize that being vulgar is not necessarily the same thing as being funny. The most offensive thing is that they expect us to laugh at their really lame attempts at humor.'Semi-Pro' is one of the worst comedies ever made!",2,5,12,7 March 2008
