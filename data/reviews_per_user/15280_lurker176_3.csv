Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Vol. 2: Tarantino's Tedious Second Act
","Kill Bill was split into two segments, most likely because of its running time. Vol. 1 ended shortly after endless, over-the-top action sequences. Unfortunately, despite its promising intro, presented satirically by Thurman, Vol. 2 does not live up to its counterpart.Keep in mind that it is only the second half of the same movie, but act two, while undeniably good, lacked what made Vol. 1 great. There is no breathtaking violence aesthetic here, the film only wraps up the story, a disadvantage to the non-linear format that was so powerful in Vol. 1. As a cinematic experience, Vol. 2 felt lacking and incomplete without its sister film. When viewed sequentially as one movie, Kill Bill was a near perfect action movie. Unfortunately, Miramax's marketing ploy took away a lot from a great work of art.",7,1,3,25 April 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Violence is an art. Welcome to Tarantino's gallery.
","Style over substance is the underlying theme of Kill Bill Vol. 1, the first segment of Quentin Tarantino's two-part kung-fu flick. The movie drops you straight into the action, allowing the plot to unwind in a non-linear format along the way.Uma Thurman brings her raw physical performance to the screen, breathing life into a character written for her. Her mysterious character has a checklist of people she plans to kill, driving the seemingly basic and obviously violent plot forward.The movie is extremely violent, but in a beautifully stylized way that has never before been achieved on-screen. The visual stimulation of the stunts and effects distracts the viewers, never allowing them to fully grasp the grisly nature of the senseless killings until after the spectacle has ended. Another great achievement in American cinema by its greatest fan and veteran, Quentin Tarantino. Hats off to Kill Bill Vol. 1.",9,1,3,25 April 2009
Pulp Fiction," The Perfect Film
","Pulp Fiction is the movie lover's movie. Every performance is outstanding (save for maybe Tarantino's cameo), every line memorable, and every scene fun to watch. The movie is divided into 3 bite-sized chapters, presented in a non-linear format. The movie is a glimpse into the brutal 'Tarantinoverse', a world where anything can happen (as long as it's entertaining). Tarantino seems to collect every single clich√©, reference, and element of American pop culture and shuffle it into a cinematic masterpiece of a card deck. This whole movie takes the past decade of film and redefines the future with it's witty dialog and fast, ruthless scenarios. A must see for anyone who likes movies, this is an artsy, award winning movie that doesn't force you to think. Grab a Quarter-Pounder (or Royale, as they call it in France), put your feet up, and enjoy Quentin Tarantino's unbeatable creation.",9,1,2,25 April 2009
