Casablanca," Casablanca WWII, love, intrigue and drama.
","Bogart at his best with a great cast consisting of Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains. This is a movie classic you haven't lived till you have watched Casablanca. So many memorable quotes and a epic song 'As time goes by' sung by Arthur 'Dooley' Wilson. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Who could forget the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. As CapitanRenault would say, 'I was informed that you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a *gross* understatement.' Here's looking at you kid. 3 Academy Awards in 1944 including the Best Picture of the year. This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. You and Casblanca!",10,3,4,10 November 2012
