Your Name.," Breathtaking
","If I had to explain how this movie made me feel in a few words, it would be: breathtaking, making my throat hurt. Really touching and will probably make you value the people you love.Drawing is amazing, animation is really good, this movie is worth winning an Oscar, but who cares about awards, this story doesn't need any of those to make it any better.",10,3,6,28 February 2017
