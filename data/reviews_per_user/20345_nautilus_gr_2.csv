The Blair Witch Project," ...and?
","The idea is smart. Oh yes, really smart. The result is a film that becomes scarier than you imagine many times and frequently. It is totally unprofessional (this is not a mistake; the filmmakers never meant it to be a professional-looking film). The characters are incredibly realistic; in fact, while watching the movie, you may find yourself having forgotten that it's a movie and not the truth. But the story never ends.",3,1,3,8 May 2002

","Nice film, good atmosphere, but a plot rather far away from what really was happening in the German concentration camps of the WWII: Incredible heroisms and really nice attitude from the Germans, make up a film that is easily forgettable.",5,1,2,8 May 2002
