Skyfall," Skyfall aka James Bond Rises
","This review is not detailing the plot of the film but is more of an overview of how Skyfall will join the other 22 members of the franchise.This being Daniel Craig's third outing successfully portraying as everyone's favourite secret agent, with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace dipping their toes into the world of James Bond. Skyfall has used both feet firmly to deliver what we have come to know and love in the world of 007. But with a modern twist. This time round there is far more humour with one liners that 007 has been made a custom with and also a nice piece of homage to the legacy of Bond shown through the return of the original Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger. Still as beautiful and still fully equipped with its gadgets. Javier Bardem's character of Silva is a welcomed return to memorable villains. Silva is an interesting villain with much potential and shows this early on with a great introduction set on his remote island, but sadly is diluted as the film comes to a close. One disappointment with Skyfall is with its Bond girls or lack of. Naomie Harris' Eve covers the most screen time out of the two Bond girls and makes quite an introduction for herself by shooting 007. This Mi6 agent is not like previous ones which have come and gone, as it appears that Naomie Harris' Eve is play a bigger role in future James Bond films. Compare this with Bérénice Marlohe's character Sévérine which is easily forgotten in the film due to such limited screen time and one has to ask the question of was this character really needed?The easiest way to explain Skyfall is to look at the director. Same Mendes has gone on record to say that Skyfall was influenced by The Dark Knight Batman film series of director Christopher Nolan. This is very apparent throughout the film and which is why Skyfall fails to be a traditional Bond film in some ways, but succeeds in other ways.The similarities between the two franchises are blatant, which takes away the fun fantasy of Bond and replaces it with a grittier colder realism. Bring Bond into the 21st century is not a bad thing but at the same time trying to stay faithful to the series is not an easy task. Weather it being the still shot of Bond standing on a roof overlooking London uncanny of Batman doing the same looking over Gotham City, or the plot that faintly resembles The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. It all feels like it has been done before only then it was in a suit of armour and not in a suit from Savile Row.If after watching Skyfall you are still not convinced that James Bond has put on a cape to save London City then the ending sequence should put your doubts to rest. It's almost like Sam Mendes took The Dark Knight Rises last 5 minutes and just changed the character's names around. While it feels lazy it does work and sets up Bond 24 to be the first 'real' Bond film in a long time. With all the ingredients being slowly added since Casino Royale it looks to have come together nicely for Bond's next adventure to be one to remember for all the right reasons.",8,5,12,30 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Tony Stark is pushed to the limits and is asked questions about who he is
","WARNING! – !!!THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS !!!NOTE - This film was viewed in 3D. The review will be based solely on the movie itself. How well or not the 3D effects were, will play no part in judging this film. Phase two of the Marvel film franchise now begins just as phase one did, with Iron Man.In this instalment Tony Stark is pushed to the limits and is asked questions about who is Tony Stark and how strong is he without Iron Man. Iron Man 3 is set following the aftermath of The Avengers and shows how Stark is coping with what happened in New York.IRON MAN 3 AKA TONY STARK RISESThe film suffers from the Nolan 'Dark Knight' syndrome that a lot of directors are following of late. Iron Man 3 should really be called Tony Stark Rises, as with 'The Dark Knight Rises' the screen time is mainly devoted to Stark than Iron Man. While also like 'The Dark Kinght Rises' the story does ask questions of Tony Stark the man while Iron Man takes a back seat. The problem with this is the action from Tony Stark can never match that of when he's Iron Man and for that it suffers a little. The overall feel of the film has also changed from the previous titles. This is down to a change in the director this time round, with Jon Favreau sitting this one out to concentrate on playing his character. Shane Black does a decent job and brings much more humour and bigger action to the series.DOWNEY JR. UPSTAGEDRobert Downey Jr. is once again outstanding as Tony Stark. This should come as no surprise as he showed this by the end of the first Iron Man. He has made this character his own and as through each instalment has just cemented the fact more so. However what will surprise you is that Downey Jr. is upstaged by another this time round. I am talking of Sir Ben Kingsley who plays the villain The Mandarin. Downey's performance is solid with more humour than ever but Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin takes the award. The praise is not for the character of The Mandarin but his other character. Trevor Slattery. Kingsley's performance as Trevor Slattery will not only surprise you but steals the lime light from Downey Jr. For which never returns back.OPERATION CLEAN SLATEAs the end of the film progresses you get the feeling of closure and ends on an anti-climax that leaves you asking what now? With the next Iron Man film with or without Downey Jr. a new chapter will begin. The events of The Avengers and Iron Man 3 has changed Stark and things will never be the same again. Stark has matured and his goals have changed, this is all evident as the film plays and becomes fact in the closing scenes when Stark commands to J.A.R.V.I.S to start operation 'Clean Slate'. DOWNEY JR. OUTGROWS IRON MAN SUITIron Man 3 is almost going back to the roots of the first film. Stark must search inside himself and grow in order to fulfil what is required of him. The story is good and the action scenes bigger and better to be more on par with The Avengers. Starks' dialogue is witty and fun only to be out done by Ben Kingsley. In the way the movie wraps up you can't help but think that the next Iron Man films will maybe a reboot to the series. This would mean that Downey Jr. may only play Tony Stark one more time in the upcoming Avenger's Sequel. If that is the case then it will be a shame as Downey Jr. really has set a high benchmark for this character and it won't be easy to replace him. But in the way Iron Man 3 finishes it seems like Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark story has come to an end. At 130 minutes it's the longest film in the series but doesn't feel too long. It's an enjoyable experience only tripped up by little things plot wise and the main disappointment of how little screen time for Iron Man. But with that being said it's still the best film in the series. Be sure to watch after the credits to see a post credit scene as with all the Marvel films. 3DThe 3D effects in this film do it justice in the way that it's not overused and works okay when it needs to. Like some other action films of late where you can see the extra effort put in to show off the 3D effects or a scene shot just for 3D. This is apparent here too with one of the big action scenes where Stark's Malibu home is attacked. But for me the best use of 3D is the scene set at night with the aftermath of an explosion. The falling debris, ash, flames and dust all look great in 3D. Overall the 3D doesn't really add or take anything away.",7,0,3,30 April 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel, but not stainless
","With the black cowl and cape being put in the wardrobe for the time being, our intentions are now turned to the red cape with one of if not the most iconic and notable superhero of all time the man of steel himself Superman.With a gap of 7 years between Superman Returns and Man of Steel, Man of Steel is a complete reboot of the franchise with a new cast, story and composer. With Hans Zimmer replacing the iconic sounds from john Williams and if you were still not convinced that this is a complete reboot then the title alone should settle the argument. David S. Goyer states:'We decided not to call it Superman that was very deliberate. Chris Nolan and I suggested Man of Steel, and Warner Bros. said, 'why?' And we started talking about it, and we said, 'We want a line of demarcation in the sand between the old and the new.'' The story is one from the beginning. From the opening scenes of the planet Krypton to Superman discovering his purpose there is very little rest bite. This is mainly down to the clever structure of the film with flashbacks of a younger Clark Kent understanding who he is when put to the test. These flashbacks are frequent for the first part and are intelligently placed and edited in a way that they never take you away from the story and help build what Superman is to become. It is an enjoyable way to move through a lot of information and ultimately provides a far better impact on the film than to structure it all together to make up the first hour of the film. This way it feels like a treat each time a flashback scene begins. With that all said how does it stand amongst the original films? The answer is simple, worlds apart. While the original films do look dated and have a sense of comedy about them. Nothing could be further from the truth with Man of Steel. It has that Goyer/Nolan touch as with the Batman franchise that just pulls everything from the comic books into the 21st Century. Adding as much realism and removing as much fantasy as possible.So what does that gives you with Man of Steel, the best film in the series that's what. Every member of the cast plays their part well and adds to the story being told. The two fathers (Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe) deserve a mentionable nod but none more so than the hero and villain of the film. Henry Cavill as the first ever non-American to play as Superman, does a fantastic job achieving a believable outsider who desperately wants to understand and be accepted. Michael Shannon succeeds greatly as the villain General Zod. He commands the scenes and makes a worthy opponent for Superman, showing real emotions of hate and a sense of determination. Sadly with all that said it's the action scenes that didn't quite do it for me. While there were many, there is only so many smashing through buildings you can take. As the film progressed it felt like they had run out of ideas and just decided to settle for a toe to toe slugging match through buildings until something or more interest catches their eye. Which is a shame as the film is so strong in all other areas.Overall Man of Steel is an enjoyable film and for me the best in the series. The story is strong, the characters are believable and there's ever a dull moment. But at the same time there has been other superhero movies released of late and before that, which achieve their goals a little better than what Man of Steel has done. Still none the less Man of Steel is a good foundation to build upon but will need Superman and CO to be at their best if they are to take on their biggest foe, the Marvel universe.",7,1,3,25 June 2013
