Walk the Line," I am not a Johnny Cash fan but the movie won a place in my heart!
","To be able to offer a comment on this movie I guess I should know something about Johnny Cash but to be honest although I don't know much about him still I wanted say something on the movie.Because I read a couple of negative critiques on the movie. For example Jeffrey M. Anderson says 'Every scene is a major turning point or epiphany; we never see Cash doing anything normal, we never learn his routines or what he liked or disliked. As with Taylor Hackford's Ray, we can easily follow what the character does but we rarely get an idea of who he is.' Well he may be right but I suppose when you produce a biopic you are not supposed to make a movie just for the fans of that person or for people who have known his art. I am in my early 20s and as a foreigner I barely know anything about the American music then.When I finished watching the movie I must say I am very impressed. Even if it seems like an actor/actress showcase than a movie itself the harmony between Witherspoon and Phoenix is really awesome. Even though they just perform these roles they are like real country singers with their impressive mastery.Besides Withersppon must be at her best with this movie. I mean look at her other movies like 'Just Like Heaven'. She is more than sweet in this one. She looks intelligent,precise and full of friendly love tinged with a passionate radiance. Joaquin Phoenix's performance also deserves acclaim though he did not get the Oscar. In short 'Walk the Line' is a great story of a guy who moved from rags to riches not just in term of material wealth but inner peace, love,parental affection and friendship.",Null,1,2,15 March 2006
Casablanca," difficult to put it as 'romance'
","At last I found the chance to see this time-honored movie.(I am just twenty-one)How could I describe Casablanca? It is a thriller that has an unpredictable ending?It is a romance for people who have stuck between Scylla and Charybdis to make a hearth-breaking choice at least Ä±nce in their lives? It is a drama for everyone who has lost a love in their long lives? Well Casablanca is actually cannot be included in one genre, it isn't just a romance either. It shows that romance is not all about a slushy emotionalism. It is all about feelings yes but it includes drama,a realistic nature,a realistic fight for love in a war-torn French soil. I guess that's why people still like it.Just because today some people still think romance is just about mawkishness we don't see a new Casablanca around and it's highly possible possible that we won't see again but Casablanca will be always with us.",Null,2,4,7 August 2005
Citizen Kane," take it according to its time
","I just visited 'the message board' of the movie and I saw a thread titled 'this movie is over-rated'. Well I never do pre-judge a movie without seeing it or say anything bad about it without reading about it. 'Citizen Kane' is a very old movie even for middle-aged people of 2000s. Given that I just turned my 21 I knew perfectly well it wouldn't be a flawless experience for me to to see the movie.Yeah to be honest at some points(in the beginning)I felt bored but seriously I said to myself: Come on this movie must be at the top of IMDb list for a reason right?' Then I displayed the required patience and I am pretty glad that I have seen this movie at last.Like Jorge Luis Borges said this movie is a 'metaphysical detective story'. Its subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined. All we need to do is to combine and reconstruct the fragments of this man's life portrayed perfectly by Orson Welles.With that in my mind I loved the movie and I do know that I gotta evaluate a movie according to the time it is produced. Think about it its production date is 1941 and some techniques used in the movie --series of jump cuts shot on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following the cut would look as if it took place at a time long after the previous cut. --Unprecedented use of deep focus. In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. If you are very young and not patient enough you may not appreciate the movie but if you can be patient enough you will understand why so many people give high points to that movie but it is the time-honored fact that 'Citizen Cane' is a very old movie and it is still associated with Hearst-Welles struggle.",Null,0,2,29 August 2005
12 Angry Men," Now I have a reasonable doubt!
","Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says 'it needed to be talked' based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too! Last but not least the run-time of the is about 90 minutes so after getting engaged in 90 minute of fighting arguments you feel like you have watched a game where the winner is humanity of course!",Null,0,1,14 February 2006
Troy," bogged down in goofs!!!
","'Menelaus was not slain by Hector; he outlived him and was one of the soldiers in the Trojan Horse. He was eventually reunited with Helen and they apparently lived a happy life until his death in Sparta many years later. - Agamemnon was not killed by Briseis at Troy; he survived and returned home only to be killed by his wife Clytaemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. - Patroclus was not Achilles cousin, he was probably his lover. - Achilles was killed by a single arrow shot by Paris, way before the Greeks built the horse. - Priam was killed by Neoptolemos, son of Achilles. - Patrokles was deadly wounded by Euphorbos and Hector then cut his throat. - Ajax was not killed by Hector, instead he committed suicide, after slaughtering a flock of sheep, which in a bout of madness he mistook for the Greeks that had refused him the armor of the dead Achilles. - Paris died of a poisoned arrow shot by Philoket. - Astyanax, son of Hector, was thrown to his death from the walls of Troy by the victorious Greeks. - Andromache, wife of Hector, was taken as a slave by Neoptolemos. - Aeneas was a son in law to King Priam and the second in command of the Trojan forces. So Paris asking him his name at the end of the movie is rather strange.' It is a long list of goofs isn't it? Is a person who has a smattering knowledge of Ancient Greek culture be misled by the movie? Is it all about creating a movie for a world of affluenza? Do you have to create a metrosexual Achilles(like a metrosexual Alexander created by Oliver Stone)? Do you have have to shift from retrosexuality to metrosexuality always? You decide yourself. No matter how cinematic it is I can't believe people who voted ten for this movie!!!!!",Null,0,4,3 August 2005
We Were Soldiers," too corny,unoriginal and schmaltzy!
","Just because it is true story it doesn't have to be great.I realize Hollywood, now more than ever, wants to do its patriotic duty and pay respects to those who lost their lives for the Americans. Or do they? When a movie has nothing interesting to say about war, does it really serve a purpose? Does it really have to reflect what happened then in a schmaltzy patriotic way? I realize that in the first 45 minutes of the movie there was no action at all. It was just like getting prepared for a mawkish drama but we should keep in our mind that you can't create a war drama without action this is not a movie on a case like abortion or rape and a war movie is supposed to be something that affects the life of a community not a an individual. You can't just reflect the zeitgeist of war-torn families by showing taxi drivers who deliver telegrams from the soldiers out there? You can't just tell about war by using corny lines! You can't just look at a war in one-sided Americanism? To reflect a war by imagining the soul of two sides you are not supposed to reflect the lines of the Viatnemese commander in a second in the end and then saying the photographer son you gotta do it you gotta tell what these soldiers did for their country? What about the Viatnemese soldiers and what they did for their own country in their own lands? If 'We Were Soldiers' was the first war movie ever made, it would be a great one. All those men from different walks of life, thrown together in an inhuman war, while their wives wait for them back home -- such drama and pathos! But think about when 'Full Metal Jacket' was produced? It is highly time to throw Vietnam aside and think of something else more original than that! Well let's say 'We Were Soldiers' is just too Corny emotional schmaltzy 'Black Hawk Down' with a more heart that's all! If you just wanna see it by renting a DVD don't really bother. Go and rent 'Full Metal Jacket' you are gonna like that original one which looks at lives in objective ways.",Null,1,3,31 July 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," don't mind people who over-love or who over-hate it.It depends on your sense of humor.You may like it you may hate it.You will see only after seeing it.
",The first movie I saw by Kubrick was 'Full Metal Jacket'. I thought He was a brilliant director. To be honest the more I watched his movies the more I started to think that his movies have great humanitarian messages but they have per se sick themes. This is one of those movies which have hard-liners at both ends: Some liked it by describing dark comedy as brilliant some others hated it coz they did not see something very funny and probably they did not laugh more then three times during the whole movie. I always believed that a movie should be evaluated according to its time. I know that many people watched the movie because it is consistently in the top 20 on the Internet Movie Database's list of top 250 films and they were openly disappointed. Well I am one of those guys who did not laugh much during the whole movie but I am impressed by the message.Given that the fact a trailer for the movie was included as an extra in the DVD release of 'Fahrenheit 9/11' the movie got its message right though it was more than 40 years old now. If that were a better movie that could satirize the zeitgeist of cold war period than 'Fahrenheit 9/11' would have been released with a different trailer I guess. The movie slips to a different character when you know that Peter Sellers improvised much of his dialog during filming. Sellers plays multiple parts each with an appropriate and successful accent. All in all I did not see a perfect movie in IMDb's top 250 list and I thought most of the movies were over-rated but this movie has a message but Petr Sellers is very good at his performance so I can't just say 'Hey it sucks just because I did not see something funny' but I can't tell something like that either 'Hey the movie is brilliant 10 out of ten'. Even if you produce a dark comedy you have to offer a room to laugh for people.I believe Kubrick couldn't do that well enough. Not perfect but but not too bad either!,Null,1,4,26 September 2005
The Best Years of Our Lives," would have been perfect if only it had taken an open side against war
","Though 'The Best Years of Our Lives' was adapted from 'Glory for Me' by MacKinlay Kantor it reminded me of 'The Road Back' by Erich Maria Remarque.I did not read 'Glory For Me' but after having read 'All Quiet on the Western Front' I had read The Road Back which was a sort of sequel. The Road Back tells the experience of young men in Germany who have returned from World War I and are trying to rehabilitate back into the society.'The Best Years of Our Lives' is a similar story even though it does not have a very strong attitude towards war. It tells the story of three ex-servicemen (an airman, a sergeant, and a sailor) who have been trying to integrate back into society.While each one is trying to sort their life out,Fred (the airman) has come to realize that his wife who took a job as a night club waitress while he was overseas doesn't really love him.Al(sergeant)who developed a drinking problem in the army gets a promotion in the bank he used to work but he has had to struggle for the loan rights of the ex-servicemen.Homer(the sailor) cannot seem to face with his situation of losing his hands at the war and he doesn't want to tie his longtime girl Wilma to himself because of that. During their laudable struggles we see Wilma talking the sailor into marriage,Fred falling in love with the sergeant's daughter and Al's efforts to try to catch up on the growth of his son and daughter.The performance of Harold Russell, who lost both hands in the war and played an amputee is really commendable.He absolutely deserves to be 'the only actor to receive two Academy Awards for the same performance.' Actually there is a little bit latent praise on heroism and war in the movie.For example in a scene where the sailor Homer is offered some sundae by Fred who is working at the drugstore a guy approaches the sailor and implies he lost his hands for nothing and Homer is offended with some sort of exclamation 'Some Americanism!So we're all a bunch of suckers?So we should've been on the side of the Japs and the Nazis?'. I just did not feel that the director reflected enough attitude against war.It just feels like he kinda supported Homer's mindset.Of course the movie succeeds in reflecting harsh situation of the post-bellum life of veterans. We can see that they feel alienated,aloof and detached from their normal life and their loved-ones but it just doesn't fit right if you do not take an open side against war and its harsh realities and harms.",Null,4,20,4 July 2006
Taxi Driver," gritty realism powerful performances but a possible fantasy ending!
","'Taxi Driver' is one of the very rare films that caught my attention with powerful performances and dark gritty realism. Even though I don't know the feeling of living in a city which has a dark seedy--at least visible-- side I can say it is not a typical American flick. You do not see a hero who kills bad men and achieves something good in the world of wickedness! You do not see just action which may be pretty goony in any film. You do not see just philosophical inner monologues but you feel you are just involved the story of Travis. Travis is an alienated guy who tries to comes to grip with the socially disoriented world around himself. He suffers from insomnia and consequently takes a job as taxi driver and volunteers to work the overnight shift 'anytime, anywhere'. Travis spends his spare time watching pornography in seedy theaters and driving around aimlessly through the darkest and most repulsive neighborhoods of Manhattan.While he just drives through these detestable neighborhoods of the town we witness the seedy side of the town and we feel the struggle of a frustrated lonely guy against the cold and distant world. The only thing that the movie lacks is the ambiguity of its ending. Roger Ebert has written of the film's ending, 'There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's 'heroism', and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters.' I am not sure it is practically true either. In that way it reminded me Barton Fink which sounded like a sophisticated joke to me when it ended coz I had not figured out which part was fantasy which part was reality. Watch and decide I would say!",Null,0,1,19 November 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," more innovative than any animated movie!!!
","When I first thought on what I have seen in this animated movie..well I think it seems pretty realistic in spite of all the imaginary monsters and a monster world! I mean look at that 'Monstropolis' city scenes.They really challenged to create a parallel world for the monsters. All details of everyday life were considered (chairs have rear openings for tails; buildings have multiple doors of different sizes). And the the pastels are undeniably beautiful and easy on the eyes!!! And the way I think is that monsters were really created in different sizes,shapes,colors, contrasts. they are really creative animations. Out of ordinary! For example when you look at the Celia's hair you can see the innovative animation! Mosters Inc.is better than any animation movie I have seen including 'Shrek' and the 'Finding Nemo'..The animation is better, the story is many times more innovative and the characters are more endearing and less clichéd. Maybe Sulley's attachment for a human kid is similar to the attachment of a mammoth for a human kid in 'Ice Age' but this is really different. While Sully is the top scare-maker at Monsters, Inc.--the electric utility of the monster world he gains a compassion for a one he scared. He learns he can get the power he needs for the monster world by making the kid laugh.And that Mike Wazowski really learns something from his friendship.I think in every way marvelous animation.

Fargo," not a bad story but at the end American type of flick!
","I suggest you should just check out the comments-board of the over-rated movies in IMDb's top 250 movies. Almost all the people who give a top ten vote for such over-rated movies are viewers from America and Canada(mostly). Here's another over-rated movie. When I read the disclaimer in the beginning of the movie 'a true story' that 'took place in Minnesota in 1987,' I thought it would be a real good movie about life itself. And the gad served its purpose yes the disclaimer really set my mood up for the movie. But the more I saw what was inside this real story the better I got the picture 'this is just a gag this is not a real story'. It could have been a real story but still it would be an American type of thing actually.A car salesman with financial troubles who hires two men to kidnap his wife and try to obtain money, a psychologically unbalanced man who lies that he lost of his wife(leukiema9 then tries to reconnect himself with his high-school crush, a robotic killer who slashes his victims in a dead-pan face' I am not saying it can't be real I am not saying the story is too bad either but it is just an American type of thing and it would be superficial to give a top ten vote for the movie.

Even if it is a good performance not an Oscar-rated one.Oscars really suck then!",Null,1,4,19 October 2005
North by Northwest," You call this a thriller good gracious good heavens?!
","'North by Northwest' is just a light-hearted,unserious move with lost of illogical scenes in the plot.An advertising man, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is mistaken for a government agent and pursued by spies who want to kill him. Thornhill is framed for murder and forced to elude the police as well as the secret agents.During the sequence of event you see many coincidences and unreasonable actions.One of them is Grant's character being chased by a crop duster. To think of killing a man with a chopper twisting around him above! Grant and leading lady Eva Marie Saint's clambering over the faces of Mount Rushmore in an attempt to evade their enemies but somehow the enemies are bypassed(one of them falls down) the other is shot by the police which arrives at the last minute in such movies that have non-apodictic plots! Another one is Grant's meeting Eva Marie Saint in the train. Have you ever seen a secret agent who involves her emotion in the job she does at least in love-at-first-sight struck way? Well the only thing I find in the movie is a little bit a sense of humor. Nothing more! Just an average light-hearted movie of which plot wanders aimlessly!

Doctor Zhivago," really better than I expected!
","Whenever I decide to watch a movie adapted from a Russian classic I am often disillusioned with the results.There are so many great Russian classic authors and their compelling,decisive, gripping,gritty real styles affected me so much.Pasternak is one of them.Doctor Zhivago was rejected in Russia at first due to Pasternak's difficult relationship with the Soviet government. In 1957 an Italian publisher smuggled the manuscript out of Russia and published the book in Russian in Milan. The book was finally published back in Russia in 1988!! Howe ironic isn't it? Well naturally Doctor Zhivago is a very long movie which defies convention some people may find the movie tediously long but it isn't actually though it's not exactly loyal to the plot of the book I guess that's the best David Lean and his team could.The performances of all the players from Omer Sharif to Julie Christie are really good.It may sound slow but the nature of the book since this is the best way to describe Zhivago's idealism and principles standing in brutal and horrific contrast to the horrors(corrupted ideals) of the Russian Revolution.All in all the movie was better than I expected!",Null,3,4,21 January 2006
The Shining," unrealistic.. only for people who over-love horror
","I realized some things this month.'Just because a movie is the top 250 list of IMDb it doesn't have to be a great movie necessarily.' 'Just because US voters gave high points a movie it just doesn't have to be a superb movie necessarily.' 'Jst because some big screen play writer or some great director was included in the total cast of movie it just doesn't have to be one of the best movies. I have seen a couple of movies by Stanley Kubrick so he was for sure a good director but I always found S. King's writings preposterous. In the movie We are introduced to Jack Torrance, driving up to the Overlook Hotel in the mountains of Colorado, to be interviewed for the position of caretaker for the winter, where the snows often completely block the path to the hotel and make it inaccessible. Jack sees this as an opportunity to start off a writing career. However, the manager informs Jack about the previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who killed his wife and two daughters, cutting them into pieces. Jack, however, seems unfazed by this, saying his wife, Wendy, is 'a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.' Now after we saw that introduction it is not difficult to predict the rest of the movie at least if you are a fan of horror movie it is not supposed to be. Maybe I am living in a relatively balanced society, maybe it is just some unrealistic crap but the screenplay seemed stupid to me.What is real or what is imaginary? An isolated man who is on the verge of madness is trying to chop his wife and his little kid and there is no one at the hotel no one ever who will hear his noise and the noise of his axe? Wait a minute should we just reduce ourselves to the enjoyment of the movie? After all Jack Nicholson is doing his job great? I don't think so. Jack Torrance's monologues may be redolent of Protestant Work Ethic. Grady character may represent skewed commentary upon American history. you cans say something on the White Man's burden but if you can't realize all of these things in a reality-this is what we are living- it turns out to be a just a horror movie who over-loves horrors. And there is nothing more to that movie.",Null,1,3,6 September 2005
Gandhi," a half-naked fakir who fought for peace
","Gandhi is not a simple biopic bogged down in the common features of this genre.The movie starts with the scene of his being thrown off a train on the way to South Africa after refusing to move from the first class compartment to a third class one, used by colored peoples, while holding a first class ticket gained through mail.Then we see his starting a non-violent civil disobedience organization in South Africa by encouraging Indians to burn their registration cards,to oppose the discriminatory laws.After gaining a somewhat epic victory over General Smuts he goes back to India.He starts the rouse the same civil consciousness among the Indians here.Through non-violence and non-cooperation policy he creates many things.The famous 400 kilometers Salt March,his encouraging the use of homespun cloth (khadi)against the British clothing,his learning to love rather than feeling lust are all parts of his philosophy.He was not a man of status quo.He improved himself by thinking,reading,actively seeing the abject poverty of his people by traveling through hundreds of locations in the Indian countryside.He was a man of evolving.While he was a man who said 'God is truth' he became a man 'Truth is God'.His principles:'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'.'There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for'.inspired many people around him though it seemed they were not enough for the fanatic minds bogging down in civil war after the Indian,Pakistani independence.This is what this movie about.It is long but it couldn't have been shorter to cinematize this great soul.On the contrary to what few people claimed I believe Ben Kingsley deserved Oscar with his perfect acting,finesse,and his lively portrayal. There is only one deviation from the historical truth in the movie.It is not basically a deviation but we don't see any of Gandhi's having children.After marrying his wife through his parents' arrangement they had four sons.Yes it's true that he gave up his marriage life through celibacy according to his philosophy of brahmacharya but they had a physical marriage life before that. We don't see much of it in the movie.Other than that Gandhi is not a showcase of an actor,neither does it try to make you blind with only the positive sides of him.An example Gandhi supported the British in World War I and encouraged Indians to join the army.Even if his rationale behind that was that 'if he desired the full citizenship, freedoms and rights in the Empire, it would be wrong not to help in its defense.' that turned out to be utterly wrong for India. We see something about Jinnah-Gandhi conflict too in the movie.When India was about to gain its independence the Muslim community was in fears of being melted down so Jinnah did what he thought right for the Muslim community but in the end neither his efforts nor Gandhi's fasting couldn't prevent the two communities getting involved in a civil war.The movie shows epic scenes in the border conflict between Hindus and Muslims.To know more about this conflict of course just a movie is not enough but the director does his best.The basic turn-of events result from the piggish attitude of the British empire actually. They always left a bone of contention where-ever they left.Today Kasmir is still a problem for internal conflicts for these two countries.Think about other examples(Musul-Kirkuk. The British did not want to leave here to Turkey because of petroleum.Now these cities are still bone of contention between Kurds Turkomans and Shiite Arabs.Israel-50 year old state which has no natural borders.Palestine,which has still no natural borders created to hush the Muslims.Lebanon is another one which is still having problems.So what the British left for the world was not other than misery and conflict.What the modern counterpart USA will leave for the centuries to come won't be different than that at all.You may ask whether I wrote for the movie or not?Well of course it was general but don't contend with just seeing this movie.We have so much to learn for the peace of the world and for this purpose it's not enough just to see the movie even Gandhi is a nearly perfectly made movie.",Null,2,7,25 April 2006
Spirited Away," it may look unrealistic at first sight look closely you'll catch the difference!
","I should start this comment by saying: You need some time to ponder over that anime! First of all I am not Japanase so it's not easy to affiliate yourself with Japanese culture(for example if you know nothing about Shinto religion it's really difficult to put pieces together)When I first finished watching that movie I thought 'Hey it's really fun but it's just a conglomeration of imaginary fantasies but when I really pondered upon it and when I did some reading on it I realized that there are more to Spirited Away that eyes can see at surface. For example there is no clear-cut distinction between good and evil just like in real life right. Even Haku and No-Face who seem good at first look have their share of bad and good within their souls. Words have such a power in the movie. For instance Chihiro has to keep her real name in her mind if she doesn't want to be entrapped in the spirit world. This is actually what we do in real life. We attach such an importance to words that our emotions like anger,love,hatred,passion are channeled through the power of words. Greed makes spirits and people oblivious to what really matters in the movie. Spirits and people's greed (even Chihiro is greedy when it comes to grasping her parents attention)is self-destructive mostly. In short Spirited Away shows us the consequences of actions that alter the natural order of things in destructive ways just look around you you'll see how we humans are self-destructive by creating a figment of our imagination that we are not hurting ourselves but others to gain a place.Spirited is the story of transformation of a whining weak greedy little girl into a capable altruist brave girl.I say don't miss it!",Null,1,1,4 March 2006
Gone with the Wind," there are so many slight discrepancies between the book and the movie but it's still a nice adaptation.
","Before telling anything about the movie I just should say that I always read the book before seeing an adaptation. 'Gone With The Wind' is book that sounds like a book having racist elements in it. I am pretty aware that the book was published before nearly 30 years of the time activists like Martin Luther King but I can sense that M. Mitchell has a sympathy for the social strata of the South. She limns house slaves like Mammy and Pork as devoted and loving servants whom the whites treat like family. In the novel, all masters treat all slaves well. Although some admirable characters dislike slavery, Ashley and Frank among them, once the slaves are freed both the characters and the narrator describe blacks as 'trashy,' 'insolent,' and 'creatures of small intelligence.' Plus we can easily feel that the writer approves the acts of Ku Klux Klan. In the movie it's not too easy to see that element but you can catch a few words like Rhet Butler's description 'poorly-brained darkie'... Vivian Leigh as the strong,selfish,opportunistic Southern belle Scarlett has a good performance while Olivia de Havilland as the physically frail but spiritually strong and good-hearted Melanie is satisfactory enough. But let me tell you that Hattie McDaniel as the old heavy set mammy deserves the 'Best Actress in a Supporting Role' she got as the the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar. I had admired Leslie Howard as Professor Higgins in 'Pygmalion' but I thing his performance as 'the honorable but weak Ashely Wilkes' is really poor. The performance of players give really something to the should of the movie but really I am a person who attaches importance to little details in a movie. It is not possible that you can see a detailed technical description of fall of Atlanta towards the end of civil war. Even f there were the necessary technology the runtime would not permit that. It's already 225 minutes. Another thing is that Scarlett has one kid from each of her three husbands but we don't really see any of her kids other than Bonnie. In the book characters use alcohol to cope with stress, but when they abuse alcohol, disaster ensues. Drinking is partly responsible for Gerald's death: he rides his horse while drunk, misses a jump, and is thrown to his death he doesn't actually dies because riding crazily after Jonas Wilkerson the white trash as he is called both in the book and in the movie.He gets drunk after refusing to sign an oath stating that he was a Union sympathizer, and breaks his neck jumping his horse over a fence on the way home.Morover in the book, Suellen ends up marrying Will Benteen, a 'Cracker' who comes to live at Tara after the war.Will Benteen is not a character in the movieand so Suellen's marriage is never mentioned. One more thing is that...that night when Frank Ashley and other decent people go to a Ku Klux Klan meeting(the movie never mentions that name openly) well when the Yankee guards come to search Melanie's house they read David Copperfield at home in the movie but actually they read Les Miserables in the book and we never see Archie-Scarlett around in the movie! In the book, Archie is an ex-convict whom Melanie allows to sleep in her basement, and who stays on out of obligation to her. In the movie, several of Archie's lines in the scene where they are waiting for news of the ill-fated Klan raid are said by Mammy. But after all this is a pretty adaptation for such a 1000 page book.

The Chorus," a movie for people who love sweet warm movies!
","A teacher who, through firmness, kindness, and understanding mostly kindness and understandingtames the savage hearts of his or her pupils.In addition to compassion brings music into the lives of his students. a teacher who transforms the lives of his students. Well at face value it sounds like a schmaltzy usual movie doesn't it? Well believe me I don't like predictable movies but this one makes you feel different and it is a really sweet movie.Gérard Jugnot's performance is really fine. His role as a teacher who has a message like 'LOVELESSNESS IS THE DISEASE, SINGING IS THE CURE' is a finely-crafted one! And don't forget the soundtracks! After 'Garden State' those songs were the best I have listened! I am pretty surprised that not so many people voted for the movie though it got an Oscar nomination. It is a movie for people who love sweet warm movies!",Null,1,2,22 September 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," another popular movie which has little historical accuracy
","I do not how to start writing a comment on this movie.'Lawrence of Arabia' is today regarded as a masterpiece of world cinema and it has been consistently on the top 250. I'm not questioning the value of top 250 anymore just because it does not really reflect the total gusto of all the cinephiles. But I wonder whether 70-mm widescreen, color cinematography, epic war scenes or heroism are enough to make a movie acclaimed. The first thing I'm looking for in a movie is 'historical accuracy'.Since the movie takes its name from the leading character Lawrence let me ask you a question to those who casted a top-ten vote for this movie?Do you really know how Lawrence looked like?Six foot two inch Peter O'Toole differed strikingly with the real Lawrence, who was almost nine inches shorter.Lawrence was not a gung-ho drama queen who lead a nation to freedom.Most scenes such as the attack on Aqaba were heavily fictionalized from the writings of Lawrence.You can easily question how much he is reliable.Lawrence mentions in his Seven Pillars of Wisdom that he was raped by the Turkish Bey which was called into question by the historians.(Check out the article : Lawrence of Arabia 'made up' sex attack by Turk troops By Elizabeth Day) Not only most scenes are heavily fictionalized but some characters are a bunch of fiction too like Sheriff Ali,Mr. Dryden and Colonel Brighton. The movie neither tells you anything from the Turkish point point of view nor does it tell anything about the real Arab points. Yes it's a well-know truth that the Arabs were tricked into fighting against the Turks by the British and they have been paying the price by being belittled by the westerners for centuries.But the movie shows us only a bunch of Bedouin tribes which are desert dwelling nomadic people. Not every Arab is (and was)a Bedouin.Plus when I see 'Language: English / Arabic / Turkish' tag on IMDb I can't help laughing.It's fact that Westerners have always imposed their language on the nations they dominated. Arabs started to speak English then just like some African nations started to speak French. Yes they have been living under the Turkish rule and they have not been speaking Turkish. That's the truth but how on earth from a ten year old kid to pariahs everybody speaks English.Let alone that the actors who play the Turkish soldiers do not even look like a Turk they do not even speak a word of Turkish. The only Turkish word you hear is 'su'(water)which is spoken by a wounded villager on the hospital in Damascus. The historians say that the real Lawrence actually shunned the limelight, as evidenced by his attempts after the war to hide under various assumed names but the British officers certainly did not the find the attack outrageous since the Great(!) British Empire can finally be positioned at a table with the French to take care of the rest of the Turkish empire.And according to Wikipedia the film's portrayal of General Allenby as a cynical, manipulative superior to Lawrence is not entirely accurate either. Allenby and Lawrence respected and liked each other, and Lawrence once said of Allenby that he was 'an admiration of mine'... There are people who claim that such fictionalization was necessary to dramatize the great Lawrence character but I say 'watch out! The devil lurks in the little details'",Null,22,65,7 August 2006
City of God," A city of God where God is non-existent!
","'City of God' is about making your own way really! No matter in which conditions you're living in the life you lead is not always conglomeration of what you've lived always but it's something you pick and choose in a life you lead. The more you have power to direct yourself, to choose for yourself, the more decisive and decided you are the more successful you will be. Of course the society always shapes people and it's not the linchpin for your destiny. The movie is such a story. While Rocket dreams of being a photographer and makes his way into that dream Lil Ze is a hoodlum who satisfies his thirst for murder, who plunders and who desire more and more power. City of God is totally realistic! I am impressed by the fact that most of the actors in the film had never acted before and were, in fact, residents of favelas(slums)such as Vidigal and the 'City of God' itself. The setting and the time fiction seems totally realistic too.If you wanna a realist piece of story do not forgo watching until the end!",Null,2,4,2 January 2006
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," another great environment theme by Miyazaki
","I came to recognize Miyazaki when I saw his two famous animes 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke' on top 250 list.Like it or not there are still many people who don't take the animation genre seriously into account.But we should always bear in mind that anime is not exactly an animation.Its distinctive character and background aesthetics visually set the genre apart from the animation. You probably notice most animes look like hand-drawn cartoons while the animation is openly computer assisted.Not just that you can watch an animation with your kids or little siblings but you may not just expect a kid to like an anime.They are really sophisticated,profound and philosophical. As people start to recognize Miyazaki from his well-known works they can't help wanting to see more animes by him and this leads us to see his earlier great works which are relatively less known than his recent great work of arts. Pretty similar to Mononoke-hime there is an open 'environment' theme in Nausicaa.The story takes place 1000 years after the seven days of fire,a catastrophe which destroyed the world's ecosystem.Although humans survived the disaster which they probably caused the land surface of the Earth has become heavily polluted and the people started live in clusters away from each other.Most of the world is covered by dangerous forests which house poisonous insects including the giant 'OHMU's.The sympathetic heroine of the story Nausicaa is noted for her empathy towards animals, humans, and other beings even to those giant insects in the dangerous poisonous forests.When the surviving humanity is still in throes of some interests this girl-the princess of the Valley of the Wind finds out that the forest is actually reviving its pure ecology and the insects are actually there to protect the forest.While the people are still hanging on to personal conflicts(like using God warriors against each other)this girl's duty would not be easy. This great anime was released in 1984 long before Miyazaki's recent classics.It's nearly as good as them.Don't miss this anime feast.",Null,1,2,30 June 2006
Garden State," the best soundtracks ever!!!!
","I have seen Zach Braff's performance in the TV SHOW 'Scrubs'. He was excellent in his role as a rooky intern doc! First of all while I was surfing through the internet I saw in a search engine that the soundtracks of that movie was the most searched element.So I thought to myself I should watch this movie. It has the best soundtracks I have ever heard of so far!! One more thing that makes this movie different from others movie is that it shows with great finesse that it is not an obligation that that should be some sexual scene just because there is a leading actress and actor! You can see something like that in 'The Last Samurai'. not a sexual scene other than a sweet innocent kiss! Actually I watched this movie a couple months ago when I recommended to a friend she said after watching it 'I watched the Garden State. At first I didn't like where it was going.It seemed low budget and raunchy, but it quickly grew on me and now I think it is one of the sweetest movies I seen. I am amazed that Zach Brach wrote and directed it. I find him to be amazing. He is calculated in all his moves which makes his somewhat odd features attractive.He has his own style that is distinctly him. I listened to the writers comments after the movie (you can do that with DVD's) and he said that his mother, whom he is close with, (another reason I like him) is a psychologist. Maybe that is where he gets the mind he has to write as he did. He did not make the movie for just entertaining, he put real life into it. I was also impressed about something else too. The girl he made the movie with (forget her real name__my friend mean Natalie Portman-for sure she is better than in 'Closer') wanted to do the bedroom scene with details. She kept begging him to do a sex scene but, he did not want to.(Bet he was tempted to!) He wanted it just as he had it where the camera pans in on them after the fact as they are covered in the sheets sleeping. He felt that sex scenes take the viewer out of the story and he wanted to avoid that.Give that man a medal!! He will never get the right recognition for that, but I think that was very beautiful and sensitive and of a higher creativity to choose what he did. He was so 'Not typical.'I like the fact that the they got intimate with their hearts first. They were real with each other even though they were messed up and yet they still found each other.Sweet!Oh! The reason I got the movie in the first place! The music. It was good. I am going to see if the library has the sound track.'",Null,0,1,20 September 2005
Black Hawk Down," like a documentary footage..
","Black Hawk Down opens with a quote by Plato: 'Only the dead have seen the end of war'. Then, over a color-desaturated series of images, we are presented with a brief history of why the United States was in Somalia in the early '90s. The story begins on October 2, 1993. Characters are introduced - Major General William Garrison (Sam Shepard), who is in command of the U.S. military presence in the region; Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), recently promoted to commanding a team; Company Clerk John Grimes (Ewan McGregor), who is about to exchange paperwork for a gun; Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), in charge of a segment of the ground troops; and Master Sergeant Paul Howe (William Fichtner), who will challenge orders if he thinks they are ill-advised. Together, these men, and many others, are about to become involved in a seemingly routine mission that will go disastrously wrong. ........The objective is to capture several key advisers to Mohamed Farrah Aidid, the warlord who controls Mogadishu. The United States wants Aidid out of the way, and this seems to be the best opportunity to advance that goal. But the troops, both on the ground and in the air, encounter stiffer resistance than expected, and this results in the downing of two black hawk helicopters. The ground troops then become divided as the raid turns into a rescue mission, and, in part because of poor planning and in part because of bad luck, the fire fight turns into a debacle. ....It is informative, a history lesson on Somalia that many of us needed. The film is visually brilliant, a spectacular dose of reality that made me repeatedly say, 'How did they do that? No wait, how did they do that?' I cannot stress this point enough. 'Black Hawk Down' makes you believe you are watching a documentary or live CNN war footage by one of those crazy reporters. It has that much gritty authenticity. ....the film is more about the incident than it is about the people fighting the battles. It relies too much on action and battles, in my opinion, instead of getting to the heart of the matter, the humans involved in this slaughter. There are so many U.S. military personnel involved in this failed mission that we never really know who any of them are...",Null,1,2,28 July 2005
A Bug's Life," it may sound just like a cliché retelling but the animations are really great!
","Flik is a different,strange, an individualist a would-be inventor in a colony of ants that is persecuted by a gang of predatory grasshoppers, which arrive once a season demanding food from the ants. While working with an invention(a harvesting tool that could make things easier for ants to pick fruit more efficiently, Flik unintentionally destroys the offering that the ants were putting together to ward off the grasshoppers. Given a temporary reprieve by the grasshoppers, the ants agree to Flik's plan to find 'warrior bugs' to fight off the grasshoppersFlik actually believes the plan, while the other ants see it as effectively exiling Flik.And right there when Flick starts a travel we start on a journey of animation for fun not just for kids but it's also a fun for many adults! I read some negative reviews here on IMDb on grounds that this animation is not entertaining for adults.Well I disagree.Maybe it's based on a cliché: The good beats the bad. Maybe it's a retelling of Aesop's fable of The Ant and the Grasshopper.But still the animations have a great artistic value.And I really liked it.

Annie Hall," anti-semitism, Freud, direct camera scenes etc.. different but not great
","I am not surprised to learn that Marshall Brickman--the co-writer of the script suggested the title 'It Had to Be Jew' to the movie. I found Allen's anti-semitism references obsessive and unnecessary. It is not just that anti-semitism references.If you do not know much about Freud the comedy may not make much sense for you. You should know something about the concepts like 'latency period', 'penis envy', 'polymorphously perverse' etc... When you try to create a comedy about love I guess you do not have to make pointed references to sex all the time either. I sort of liked the techniques used in the film but they don't necessarily make sense. For instance, Allen's character, standing in a cinema queue with Annie Hall and listening to someone behind leaves the line to speak to the camera directly. The man comes to speak to the camera in his defense, and Alvy Singer/Woody Allen resolves the dispute by pulling McLuhan himself from behind a counter to tell the man that his interpretation is wrong.In another scene also when Allen is at a dinner with the family of Annie Hall he just starts talking about the family to the camera directly...ALL IN ALL I SORT OF LIKED BUT IT IS NOt A GREATEST MOVIE AT ALL...",Null,1,7,6 November 2005

Once inside, she exposes herself to him and offers to have an affair with him. Initially flustered, he flees. A few days later he calls her and their affair begins. Does anyone see something original in the beginning of the plot? Then in the middle of the story he-Benjamin- falls in love with the daughter of the woman on their first co-erced date? Is there anyone among you who falls in love in the first date,which is especially a coerced one. And what is that 'romance comedy' label anyway? Where is romance? How do you describe it? Romance is supposed to have some sort of 'exciting and mysterious quality (as of a heroic time or adventure)' even if it is a comedy. So did I find something like that?

Pride & Prejudice," worth watching though some characters look like being misinterpreted
","I don't know whether any other work in English literature has been adapted into silver screen so many times.I know to make a comment of comparison doesn't sound good but I couldn't help myself comparing this fairly recent adaptation with the Bollywood adaptation 'Bride and Prejudice'. First of all this adaptation is as much loyal as it can to the work of Jane Austen. Keira Knightley performs well as Elizabeth.If you read the book you know what makes us admire Elizabeth: Her honesty,her quick-witted answers her feisty nature but we also know her with her her sharp tongue and tendency to judge quickly.The difference is right here. Aishwarya Rai in Bollywood adaptation can't give that quick-witted but honest Elizabeth. She seems more like a haughty self-centered lady who likes humiliating her interlocutor. Brenda Blethyn reflects the mother,who is consumed with the desire to see her daughters married no matter what,in excellent acting.Donald Sutherland as the self-possessed but irresponsible father is not bad either.Jane is the most beautiful one of the sisters and I guess they made some efforts to make Rosamund Pike(Jane) more beautiful than Elizabeth(Keira Knightley). I can't say they are unsuccessful. But what really caught my attention is that...we know Bingley is well-intentioned fun guy but in the movie he seems like a(what is mot juste here?)I don't know he just seems too too easygoing. He is not like Bingley in the book. We also know that Darcy is a class-conscious cold guy but Matthew Macfadyen walks like a half-fainted body(especially his eyes) all the movie even when he proposed Elizabeth the second time.Just being cold isn't necessarily having a dead-pan face.(But William Darcy in Bollywood adaptation looks cool and cheerful this must be worse to interpret Darcy's character)And last Sylvester Morand as Mr. Collins seems like a sensible guy at many points.He is just a pompous, idiotic obsequious clergyman!! In Bollywood adaptation the guy paying him looks really idiotic. All in all it's a chance to visualize Jane Austen's work. Not perfect not too bad worth watching!",Null,0,3,6 March 2006
Life Is Beautiful," WW2 isn't just about Jewish suffering!
","Benigni is lauded by many Jews because he embraced the holocaust.Actually we are overwhelmed with that holocaust theme too much. Schindler's List, The Pianist and this movie...There many be many other movies but these three are the most top-rated ones I guess. Well let me give some statistical knowledge about the WW2.WW2 was a period of immense human(not just Jewish) suffering.Nearly 55 million people lost their lives but only six million of this death toll was Jewish. Due to the holocaust 4 million non-Jews made up of Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, dissidents, Afro-Germans, the disabled, Soviet prisoners and others had lost their lives. About about 20 to 28 million Soviets died in total, of which 13 to 20 million were civilians. Now given that these statistic are absolutely true why the these directors insisting make movies on the holocaust?As a human being I sympathize with the Jewish people who suffered immensely then! But as a human being I also sympathize with other non-Jewish people who lost their lives then! Why the heck they don't make movies out of the sufferings of Soviet,Poles,anti-communists etc...? If this Jewish suffering had been so real why does this race's governing council create the same stuff in Palestine with a great newspeak of terrorism? Does the Western have a courage of making a movie on Palestine, Hiroshima,Yugoslavia? Isn't anybody aware that The most notorious atrocities occurred in China, including the slaughter of almost half a million Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, and Unit 731's experiments with biological warfare in Manchuria, with a view to killing a large part of the Chinese population. Japanese war crimes also included rape, pillage, murder, cannibalism and forcing female civilians to become sex slaves, known as 'comfort women'. Many of these occurred in Korea, which Japan occupied from 1910 to 1945. Doesn't anybody think it is worth cinematizing the suffering of these people as much as the suffering of Jewish people? It may be a great script to think of a dream quality to make your son survive the concentration camp but it is due to create something else. You may create a dream quality to survive the brothel in Korea or China. Do something for those people. Amen to the Jewish suffering!",Null,5,14,19 January 2008
A Clockwork Orange," the message is humanitarian but the movie is itself sick just like some other Kubrick movies
","This is Stanley Kubrick! His work of art raises the question but never provides a clear-cut answer! Kubrick is someone who sees progress as an illusion.According to him people are doomed to repeat their own mistakes.So it is about a sick rapist violent delinquent teenager 'Alex' who is conditioned against sex and violence in a Pavlovian method.The moral question of the film is that Alex is now 'good', after such a an aversion therapy but his ability to choose this has been taken away from him; his 'goodness' is as artificial as the clockwork orange of the title. You see the message of the movie is really great. It questions human's power of free-will.It shows us that it doesn2t matter to be good or evil without having a full-power of free-will.Coz the free-will is what makes us different from the other creatures. Well it is just as sick as any other Kubrick movie like 'The Shining' or Full Metal Jacket' maybe this is the most over-rated one but this is Kubrick! NO NEED TO MAKE SO MANY COMMENTS!

Reservoir Dogs," more realistic than Pulp Fiction

I chose to watch 'Reservoir Dogs' after watching 'Pulp Fiction'. Believe me this movie deserves a better place. You don't see just some cocky Hollywood actors that are trying act out some scenes or violent crimes you just feel the characters that are portrayed by them. You don't have to discuss whether something sounds like a miracle, a divine intervention or just a coincidence like in 'Pulp Fiction'. Everything is in there and you just see it and feel it. You don't try to figure out whether a bad character could be subjected to some sort of redemption as in the case of 'Samuel Jackson' in 'Pulp Fiction'. Tarantino shows that a great film could be made just with 1 million. The only thing I could doubt is that Michael Madsen plays a character named 'Vic Vega'suspiciously close to Travolta's 'Vincent Vega.' Tarantino would later confirm that the two are brothers. But for my part they don't look like brothers at all. I seriously doubt that.Other than that I really liked it more than Pulp Fiction.",Null,1,3,11 August 2005

Before calling it one of the best pieces of moving pics we gotta keep a few things in our mind.We gotta roll then over in our heads. ***One would wonder why a professional such as Vincent would not keep his gun on him: the answer may be that it was Marsellus' gun.

It may be just a coincidence right? ***The rapists take Marsellus into the back room and rape him; Butch escapes his bonds and in a disturbing, comic, and somewhat surreal scene. Does anyone think this was a unrealistic scene? He could untie those sturdy robes just because he is a boxer?(He is definitely not a palooka as he is called by Vincent but it still seems far-fetched?) ***While driving back to the motel from the apartment complex, Butch accidentally (and literally) runs into Marsellus himself.Another divine intervention right? ***Jules himself, after he and Vincent are shot at repeatedly from point-blank range yet survive?? I understand that redemption and divine intervention are two themes that drive us to think but the way I think is that these are not just like that.

Sean Penn filling out the production with a murky big-dangerous-hearted performance. Kevin Bacon anchoring with stability and level-headedness. Robbins performance is also good.

All Quiet on the Western Front," When a man stand face to face with death surviving is not an adventure.
","It's not easy to recognize the artistic value of this movie without reading Remarque's original book version first so I suggest you read the book first before seeing the movie.All Quiet on the Western Front is a unique work of art because above all it is not a war movie where you find heroism,bravery or undaunted warfare deeds.This is the story of Paul Bäumer-a young man of nineteen who fights in the German army on the French front in World War I with his classmates Tjaden, Müller,Albert etc...They are actually enlisted in the army voluntarily after listening to the passionate over-patriotic speeches of their teacher, Kantorek. But after experiencing brutal training at the hands of the unassertive,ignorant, and authoritarian Corporal Himmelstoss and the inconceivable brutality of life on the front,Paul and his friends start to question the value of nationalism and patriotism. Thay start to ask how the war started anyway and who the major provoker of this meaningless brutality was?Among the monotony of the artillery fire,the difficulty of finding some decent food,their pushing their luck for fleeing from the inescapable death shows them they are fighting the war for a few persons whom they have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends. The movie displays the brutality of the war not by means of one-to-one combat in the field. The director regularly shows the bombardment fields and how soldiers are trying to flee from their death not they are running to fight.The after-amputation scenes in which soldiers presume that their legs just hurt as if they really had their legs,the difficulty of finding food in the dugouts surrounded by artillery bombardments,the struggle to survive in the trenches depict the cruelties of war and how these soldiers are disconnected from emotions like grief,benignancy,and fear and each being turned into a robotic mechanism who tries to survive under these circumstances.The bombardment scenes in the movie are purely realistic even by today's standards.To shot such warfare scenes which look realistic even today must require a lot of cinematic skills but the acting is merely melodramatic and gushy at some points like Paul's crying out 'Oh Albert I've come back'. The soldiers who are supposed to be isolated from their humanly emotions are not supposed to display such acting I suppose.It just spoils the perfection of the movie. That's only fault I could see in the movie.One note for those who both read the book and saw the movie: Definitely read the sequel of the book: The Road Back which details the post-bellum life of young men in Germany who have returned from the trenches of World War I and are trying to sort their life out back into the society.",Null,2,3,12 July 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," a classic though it has unrealistic portrayals of mental hospitals and mental illness
","***It is true that some mental health advocates have criticized the film for having unrealistic portrayals of mental hospitals and mental illness. ***It is also true that Ken Kesey also loathed the fact the film was not told through the eyes of Chief Bromden, like the book was, for he saw this as fundamental to the story. For these reasons Kesey never saw the film.But this movie is not just about the average life going on in a mental institution. A serial petty criminal who has been sentenced to a fairly short prison term, decides to have himself declared insane so he'll be transferred to a mental institution, where he expects to serve the rest of his time in (comparative) comfort and luxury.McMurphy's ward in the mental institution is run by an unyielding tyrant, Nurse Ratched, who has cowed the patientswho are mostly there by choiceinto dejected institutionalized submission. In this submissive world Randell shows us the meaning of freedom and non-commitment. He is the fist one who talks the deaf and dumb chief. He shows us how to attach some sort of social importance to every individual. Even if he is sick, even if he is mentally sick he is a human being who needs social communication. Somebosy is not supposed to be in an institutionalized submission just because he is 'crazy'. That is the bottom-line of the importance that is supposed to be given to every unique individual.And Jack Nicholson is totally nice in his performance.I watched him as a senior citizen in 'About Schmidt ' as someone who loses his mind in solitude in 'Stanley Kubrick's Shining' and as an aggressive therapist in 'Anger Management' but for use this movie is the biggest part of his career. As for Louise Fletcher, I did not love her performance and I don't understand why she got the academy award. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a culturally significant movie which will be always stay as a classic in spite its having unrealistic portrayals of mental hospitals and mental illness.",Null,0,2,13 September 2005

For years Hollywood made the world watch movies like 'Schindler's List' and 'The Pianist' to imprint Jewish sufferings on people's mind. Those movies were a perfect means to look at a war by only a means of suffering of race given that only the six million of 50 million demised people were Jewish. The movie perfectly humanizes Hitler and people around him without glorifying and justifying what he and his entourage did. The events mostly are reflected by the perspective of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge (Lara).Events outside Hitler's bunker are mostly depicted from the perspective of SS doctor Ernst Gunther Schenck (Cristian Berkel). Humanizing a war leader like Hitler helps us to see the historical importance of Nazis' rise to power:how human beings could be blinded by the desire to rule,govern and dominate.The movie at this point is a fine-crafted at which point shows us what happened exactly though it doesn't offer any leads of how and why? If you wanna see some attempt at objectivity, if you wanna see Bruno Ganz's laudable performance as Hitler this movie is a must to see!",Null,1,2,22 September 2005
Stalag 17," not just a prison flick story...but a prison camp story tinctured with dark but entertaining humor
","Stalag 17 is surely not a typical,usual prison-flick story.It's set at a prisoner of war camp which is muddy,desolate and oppressive.The movie opens with the men of the barracks,where six hundred American sergeants are held,plotting an escape. While the prisoners talk every little detail of the escape plan and send their friends Manfredi and Johnson to a tunnel they dug under a barbed wire one of the prisoners stands out and opens a bet that Manfredi and Jonson never make it through the forest surrounding camp. When Manfredi and Johnson are shot right way after they emerge from the other end of the tunnel the prisoners jump to conclusions that Sefton,who bets on the escape, is a stoolie. They actually have the wrong guy but Sefton is not someone liked around either. He is a cynical,cold guy who trades blatantly with the German soldiers for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuriousnesses for a POW in a camp. He also organizes rat races and and manages a portable distillery in the barracks.So just because he is not a straight-arrow it won't be easy for him to disprove the rash conclusions of the sergeants. The plot may sound a bit common maybe as I put it but the movie actually is not.Generally I do not like a genre being tilted towards another genre.If you are doing a war movie then take your job seriously but I feel like for the first time I did not frown upon the amount of humor in the movie.I read some viewers have been disappointed at the amount of dark-humour 'in what should be a true war drama.' But in an environment where they have no heating facilities (like even a simple stove),eat terrible foot,bathe in the latrine sinks,walk through the muddy walkways they try to keep sane thanks to that humor.By this way they really defy the cynical,cold,mocking air of von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) and their stupid supervisor Sergeant Schulz (Sig Ruman.)I do not like to tell anything controversial about IMDb's top 250 list again but I can't help it.There are many(and probably will be many more) movies that I'm disappointed by in this list but this one (as specifically not a usual,simple faded prison flick story) perfectly met my expectations.",Null,7,10,5 July 2006
Paths of Glory," 'The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r, And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave, Awaits alike th'inevitable hour. The paths of glory lead but to the grave.'
","I have seen 'Paths of Glory' after having learnt that it has similar similar themes and storyline to 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. After this one there are only two featured Kubrickian movies for me to be seen: Lolita and Barry Lyndon.Since these two movies were adapted from two known world classics one should first know the book before seeing the movies in my opinion.Paths of Glory is loosely based upon the true story of five soldiers who were prosecuted for the cowardice in the face of the enemy. The movies uses three soldiers for the storyline.On a time when the French and German army developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches a selfish overambitious French general during World War I orders a regiment on a suicidal mission to take the Ant hill to get promotion he has been promised. When the soldiers are under constant artillery fire the regiment refuses to leave the trenches with the third of men are dead. The general's order to open fire on his own squad and his accusations of mutiny of the simple soldiers display how Paths of Glory,with a masterly finesse, is making a mockery of the idiocy of high-ranking officials in the army.It depicts the wanton characteristics of the homo sapiens who could just rule out his entire nation for his personal ambitions.Kirk Douglas as the Colonel Dax, who leads the soldiers in the attack and is the counsel of three soldiers before the court-martial is totally great. His lines and cross-examination in the farce court make a laughingstock of war,the judiciary system of the army and the ambitions of the ignorant higher-ups. After having seen this one and Full Metal Jacket I said to myself I wish Kubrick could have done more war movies instead of involving in film-noir or a space flick.",Null,1,1,12 July 2006
Trainspotting," a movie that reflects the inner-world and the subculture of heroin abuse
",It seems like an intimate look inside the subculture of heroin abuse a young man's chose between self-destruction and free-will. I know it is better to watch movies that could give us some insight into our humanitarian values than to watch stupid action or horror movies. I heard that some people criticized the movie just because it glorifies the usage of drugs at some points well if you can't portray it in both ways you cannot create an art. I mean people gotta see why someone could have a reason to use drugs? They should see it doesn't always have to be sad ending? Someone can just get off that skag! In that sense it is such a nice movie. But no matter what... I am not a great fan of such movies maybe just because I am not living in a society that has any open drug problems or because I haven't seen anyone who has such a problem. But still the movie deserves the acclaim!,Null,0,1,18 September 2005
The Breakfast Club," great performances but a disappointing ending(worth watching except the ending!)
","'BreakFast Club' is one of the sweetest movies that I watched by ruling out the stereotypical fallacies. One can understand how parents latently and unwittingly force their kids to adopt their quirky behaviors in the past.Some parents do regard the slightest mistake as being a 'loser'. They are so perfectionist.Some parents see their kids as 'retarded big mouth know it all asshole jerks'. And others just ignore their own kids. Others say 'win win win' but do not care about feelings. Well 'Breakfast Club' is exactly such a movie into the inner-worlds of such kids who are bullied by internal pressure. I liked the performance of 'Emilio Estevez' but impressive performance of Judd Nelson is totally great!!! . The way he says the lines 'Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes. But face it, you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweebie. What would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?' is totally cool I really liked it. Of course the movie is not a faultless one. Even if the performances and the message are quiet nice the movie itself is pretty stereotypical .Allison renounces her maverick ways and succumbs to the mainstream female image (makeup, pink dress, rather submissive, etc.). nerd, Brian, ends the film without anyone, reaffirming similar mainstream conventions of male stereotypes as well, that a male who isn't either athletic or rebellious, and more so is intelligent and bookish, will be left behind and ignored by the opposite sex. I say a movie which has such a great message could have been ended with a more original ending.",Null,3,4,1 October 2005
Princess Mononoke," environment mythicized in a Miyazakian-Japanese way!
","Ashitaka, saves his village from Nago, a demonized boar-god, but his arm is wounded and cursed in the fight.As the curse spreads from his arm to all of his body, he has a running amount of time to find a cure before it kills him in great suffering.As he sets out to find a cure to this curse he meets a strange monk and encounters wolfgods and a strange girl riding these huge wolfgods.He also meets Lady Eboshi who is not evil actually though she seems evil at first.Lady Eboshi campaigns continuous wars against the spirits of the forest so she can get its resources for her people, using fairly advanced guns made in Irontown.Though she is belligerent she cares for her own people who are consisted of lepers,former prostitutes,freed slaves etc.. The movie looks really gory just like some people wrote here on IMDb but it's just anime. I mean it's not scary or disgusting it has a gripping effect.The story of love and hate, war and peace, nature and darkness...I saw Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle before and I gotta say this is more realistic than both of them.It is true that tribes of intelligent boars,Kodamas(spirits) in the Deer God's forest, apes, and wolves, along with San (the mononoke princess of the title) who was raised by the wolves looks so mythical but one can evaluate the movie as an environment flick rendered in Japanase mythology.It can be viewed by anyone no matter how old one is!",Null,2,3,11 April 2006
The Wizard of Oz," It was good to see some imaginary piece of art after having seen many movies bogged down in overrated realism.
","Dorothy,who is an orphan kid,lives with her aunt Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.Whe she gets into a clash with the humorless old witch Almira Gulch (Margaret Hamilton)in the neighborhood she decides to leave Kansas.On the road she meets Professor Marvel(Frank Morgan).Under the magical talking of the professor she understands she should go back but on the way back home she gets herself into a twister and she can't reach her aunt and uncle because the whole whole family is already down in the cellar and cannot hear her kicking on its door.After that we see Dorothy in the magical trappings of the Land of Oz.Actually the fun of the movie starts here you know.The dry sepia techni-colored Kansas environment and the dialogs sound so affected until the land of OZ.At the land of OZ you can't help reducing yourself to the enjoyment of a great imaginary musical.Maybe it will sound really irrelevant but I myself like realism in a movie and I don't like fantastical elements much but after seeing a Kurosawa movie(Rashomon which I found highly over-rated)I really liked this imaginary piece of art.I heard people remember this movie as a backdrop to their youth. When the movie was produced even my parents were not born yet so the artistic value of the movie seems like it will address the following century too.",Null,4,5,24 April 2006
The Island," it could have been better than that!
","It's eye-catching that the movie comes out at a time where we start questioning the role of God-like geneticists in the stem-cell research field. The movie starts as an interesting sci-fi thriller- where a futuristic colony of people who apparently escaped from an over-contaminated outside world.In this Utopian everything is chosen for them-what they eat,what they wear,what they drink,do play etc.. The movie takes it origin from novels like like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Richard Adams's Watership Down. I am not a regular follower of the director so it may not be right to take a critical point against his directive capabilities but to be honest after an interesting start I thought I would see a really interesting movie something better than 'Equilibrium' but you know after the introduction I saw it just turned like any other crazy action movie a movie which is actually a pastiche 'escape from dystopia' which at one point turns and takes a downhill course as just with crashes and explosions galore.. I also found the product placement pretty stupid. MSN Search, XBOX, Puma and Nokia are some of the concurrent advertised products in a grossly open way.You may sponsor a film but you don't have to distort its image right? Anyway in conclusion you can only have some fun if you are a sci-fi buff but if you are meticulous viewer don't waste your time!",Null,1,1,3 September 2005
