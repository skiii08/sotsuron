10 Cloverfield Lane," Ending ruined the whole movie
","Though this movie started out a little slow, it gained momentum and some interesting suspense. The movie was great with not knowing where it was going to end up. Until it did. Aliens at the end ruined the whole movie. It screamed of desperation - 'how do we end this thing???' Seriously.",3,1,2,18 April 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Very Unrealistic
","The movie was OK. I liked all of the actors, but the so many of the scenes were so unrealistic. This mostly had to do with the police. They don't welcome private investigators and they don't do missing child things 'in the dark'. Where was ANY of their back up on ANYTHING?? Also, the main character could NEVER have gotten away with most of his behavior in a realistic urban setting. Seriously, the scene in the dive bar?The movie was OK for a slow night, but I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it.",Null,0,3,4 September 2017
