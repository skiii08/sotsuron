Raiders of the Lost Ark," Awesome! Pure Action/Adventure!
","This is one of the greatest films of all time! It's stands at the top of the adventure genre with Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It also leads as the greatest film the Steven Spielberg has ever made, better than such classics as Jurassic Park and War of the Worlds. Harrison Ford is also perfect for the role of Archaeologist and school teacher Indiana Jones. Along with the Star Wars trilogy, the Indy series has made Ford my favorite actor. In case you haven't noticed, I am a very big Star Wars fan. Putting George Lucas and Steven Spielberg(my all-time favorite filmmaker) together could never fail, and I can't wait for number four, due in 2008.",10,1,2,18 November 2006
