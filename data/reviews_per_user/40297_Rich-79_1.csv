Alien 3," Passively brilliant
","When I first saw this film, I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed.  This was further boosted by less than brilliant reviews from numerous sources.  But as I watched it more, I began to realise how good this film actually is.  This was helped by seeing two other films directed by the brilliant David Fincher which were 'Seven' and 'The Game'.  More of a drama than a action movie, Alien 3 puts us in the mind of Ellen Ripley, and continues to show us how the Alien has wrecked her life ever since she set down on LV426 in 'Alien'.  One of her quotes is very memorable when she tries to confront the alien for herself.  She says that all she can remember is the alien, and really depicts how the monster has gotten to her over the course of the three films.  Another great thing about this film are the settings.  The art direction in the movie is superb, with the dirty and grubby sets being echoed by the prisoners that inhabit the complex.  Fincher has a real talent for creating such atmospheres that are dark, filthy and full of death. (See his later films).  For me, the best part of the movie, as for many, was the ending.  but it wasn't the Alein chasing around the refreshingly English prisoners in the labarinth tunnels of the complex, but the appearance of the true monster from the Alien saga, the people from Weyland Yutani, 'The Company'.  by this time, everyone knows what the alien looks like and does, but this is the first appearance of the company and it really does liven up a diminishing end to the film.  And the introduction of Bishops creator really does boost the story to new heights.  Like Ripley says in 'Aliens', 'I dont know who's worse.  you don't see them f***ing each other over for a god damn percentage'-them being the company.In conclusion then, Alien 3 is an average film when viewed on its own, with hidden wonders that have to be found by a eager viewer.  As and end to the trilogy of alien films, it is just quite fantastic, and I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the two prequels as this film reveals things in a much more subtle and successful way about Ripley than its poorer sequel, Alein Resurrection.Rich",Null,4,5,27 September 1998
