Hereditary," Hereditary is Fairly Scary
","Just going to open with this: This film is 14A in British Columbia, which unfortunately means the showings are full of obnoxious teenagers who think clucking constantly is funniest thing in the world, and that really does ruin the movie-going experience in a big way. However, I still felt this was a great film, even if it doesn't hit with those with the same IQ as their age who are brainwashed into adoring trashy jumpscare-riddled garbage.I was told this film is not scary, but is seriously &$@^ed up, but as soon as I saw the apparition early off in the film, I was concerned. One of my biggest fears is hallucination, so the subject matter and creepy happenings throughout the film were very effective. I was also impressed to find there were only two minor jumpscares in the film, though there were several auditory scares, which is the only bit in modern horror that I have trouble enjoying a film through. It's quite odd that when this film decides a moment is particularly creepy, an act as simple as flicking a lightswitch is amplified to 60 decibels. This only occurred several times anyways, so it was hardly an insurmountable feat.The film feels more like a drama than a horror film, even as far as classic horror movies go. I feel like the dramatic elements are the strongest aspect of the film, but that they would be simply too devastating to have in a plain drama film. It feels different, but it works, and the added creepy atmosphere fits perfectly with the traumatic material, though I wish they stuck with the drama through til the end.The acting ranged from awful to excellent. Most of the actors do a fantastic job, aside from the teenage boy played by Alex Wolff, who was hit-or-miss. This guy can emote excellently despite having a derpy face, up until he opens his mouth and attempts to deliver his lines. His dialogue isn't written well, which adds to this, as he screams and cries 'mommy' despite being an angsty teenager. He pulls off depressed, shocked, and angry perfectly fine, but as soon as he attempts sad, the results are immersion-breakingly awful. There's a scene where he attempts to cry, and it sounds like he's mocking crying, almost like he's intentionally throwing the scene and they just kept it.There were a lot of moments in which there were creepy elements subtly hiding in the background of prolonged shots, which tends to unfortunately appear in otherwise terrible horror films such as The Mothman Prophecies and The Strangers. I'm glad to see this technique properly realized and executed in this film. I wasn't bored despite the many scenes that had ultimately very little density to them, as the suspense was there, and there was enough confusion in the film to which there were several directions it could go at any point.The cinematography was very good, and certainly better than The Witch in that regard. This film is nearly as disturbing, but also much less painful on the eyes, styling it up with actual modern editing techniques, most notably color correction to make the scenes pop.The CGI effects are pretty good and interesting for the most part, up until the bugs and flies show up. The weird effects are interesting, and add to the bizarre nightmare-like air to the second act of the film. The flies are absurdly bad, and simply look like black smears whizzing around in circles through rooms. They look like basic animation loops placed incorrectly given the shots that were filmed.I also felt the ending to be a bit weak in comparison to the rest of the film. I was interested to see where the film's story was heading throughout the first two acts, and I was a bit disappointed with the conclusion. It was as goofy as it was disturbing whereas the rest of the film was just very disturbing.The film also does feel like it drags a bit towards the end, but not by much. I could imagine others might find it to be perfect, and others to find it mind-numbingly long, but I feel it's fine.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this film, but be prepared for obnoxious morons to attempt to break the immersion.",8,0,1,17 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Captain (Mar)vel
","In a simple sentence, Captain Marvel is a bad version of Wonder Woman. To further elaborate will be significantly more complicated, and to keep it simple I will avoid talking about the controversy around the film. Captain Marvel accentuates all of the shortcomings of the Marvel film format whilst bringing much less wit or charm, constantly falling back on 90's nods rather than creating original content of interest. The film in most part copies the trippiness of Doctor Strange, the nostalgic soundtrack of Guardians of the Galaxy, the setup of Thor, and the plot of Battlestar Galactica for some reason.Brie Larson's performance is unfortunately lacking, and I feel this was the main issue with the film. Captain Marvel's lines are meant to be funny quips but they are delivered with such a lack of enthusiasm that the character comes across as bored and arrogant in the face of danger, sucking out all tension from every action sequence in the film. Her powers are so strong that she makes Superman seem moderate in comparison, as she manages to feel invulnerable even at her weakest and the capabilities are astronomical to the point where she undercuts the rest of the MCU to this point. If she was this powerful and she's been around since the mid 90's, why did Nick Fury wait until it was already practically too late to page her in Infinity War? All of their issues could have easily been solved with some basic planning. Captain Marvel's introduction into the MCU is one which drags the scale to ridiculous levels, and raises many more questions than it answers. Back in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, many were asking why the Avengers weren't around to help with this massive crisis threatening the planet, and now we have to ask why Captain Marvel wasn't here to defeat Thanos in a single anticlimactic punch before he could threaten the entire universe.The cinematography was mostly awful and obnoxious. In most action sequences, there's some of the harshest shaky cam since The Bourne Supremacy, which leave said scenes incomprehensible and frustrating as well as visually unimpressive. It also leads me to believe that Marvel for all of its work in the special effects and its massive budgets can't afford to do proper choreography for even its simplest action sequences. There's also an abundance of post production editing techniques which are reminiscent to overdramatic Indian soap operas, with numerous blur and exposure as well as a misguided attempt at some creative non-linear storytelling right at the start of the film, making the dense exposition dump all the more confusing, leading into a slow dull lengthy period of film which equates to Vers being a fish out of water on planet Earth with the only main highlight being when she punches an elderly woman in the face. Slow, action-free scenes are refreshingly shot at times in contrast to the normal Marvel films, but action sequences are much worse making it more of a roller coaster ride as opposed to the usual predictably decent, easy to digest Marvel formula. The creative aspects are often a welcome flair, but the less-nuanced elements of the film more than overpower what good it has to it, leaving me to believe that the director, Anna Boden, only has a partial knowledge of artsy filmmaking.Samuel L. Jackson steals the show every time he is on screen as he's easily the most charismatic character with the most depth, which is a serious problem when you're trying to push for an integral new superhero this late into the story, as she's greatly overshadowed. The bar was set very high for Brie Larson, but her performance feels lazy in comparison to her costars as even most of the side characters seem to be trying to push her up by doing the emotional acting on her behalf and simply stating character traits rather than leaving that for Brie to portray in her performance. If I were to watch this film again, I would probably just skim through the Nick Fury scenes as well as that scene where Captain Marvel punches that elderly woman in the face, otherwise there's nothing else that really sticks positively.I'm only happy when it rains, and it never actually rains in this film despite using that song. Must be a tongue-in-cheek song, like when they used 'Just a Girl,' but then again these songs are much more memorable than the lackluster generic score. Remember Hole, The Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, and Blockbuster? This movies desperate for that 90's kid approval. I don't typically mind nostalgia, but there needs to be more. This film seems to stop trying once they have their base idea without adding depth or making any of the elements integral to the actual story. Nostalgia for the sake of nostalgia, and a social justice message instead of a thought-provoking story.Most Marvel films have at least one element which is largely flawed, but Captain Marvel seems to try to combine the best elements from each previous film, but instead manages to combine all of the worst tropes from them instead. Even at their worst most Marvel films are still at least fun at a primitive level, but this film loses that by trying to play it safe. Also, can I end this by mentioning Captain Marvel's awful fire-chicken suit?",2,3,6,9 March 2019
Ready Player One," Ready Player Dumb
","I haven't read the book, but it hardly sounds like something that would interest me. The premise is dull, and the whole virtual reality thing has not been something that has gripped my attention. What it boils down to is fan service and references aping off of people's fleeting nostalgia with a simple cookie-cutter plot to excuse the story's existence.The movie is decidedly focused on TV and film, mostly popular in the 70s through 90s, with the occasional 80s pop-rock song thrown into the mix. What I find odd is that people in the future would be clinging on to these outdated properties so seriously - it's somewhat unrealistic, as you can see if you go into a real virtual chat room nowadays as there's an overabundance of memes. It is also hard to believe that nothing new and original would have become a cultural sensation by the time this story takes place.The characters are flat and basic as can be, and the acting and writing is bad to boot. This film feels like a cheesy 90s film with its cliched dramatic elements, its inappropriately placed melodrama, and its cartoonishly evil white businessman villain. The main characters emotional acting is completely wrong, as he fails to emote following the death of his aunt, yet he over-emotes upon meeting the creator of The Oasis, bursting into tears.This film apparently introduces new story elements that don't make sense. The secret to the first puzzle is just something the average racing game enthusiast would accidentally stumble upon within ten minutes of playing the game, yet the film acts like our hero cracked the Da Vinci Code once he figures it out.The ending is one of the worst I've ever seen that shows that the writers clearly didn't think before submitting it. Once our hero gains ownership of The Oasis, he decides to shut down the Oasis two days a week to force people to go out into the real world and experience life. There is no way this marketing practice would work in real life, as logically you'd come to think 'Oh, well people work every day of the week at all times. What about people who only get those two days off? Well, **** them, I guess, who needs them anyways?' What real games do is they implement rested XP as a means to reward players for avoiding binging for extended periods of time, and this method proved to be very effective, and prior to this there were more serious issues that aren't addressed in this story at all, such as people literally dying from gaming marathons. There's a lot of material here to work with, but unfortunately everything is surface-level at best. I imagine anyone with any knowledge of gaming whatsoever will find this ending extremely annoying, and for me it was the cherry on top of a over-hyped heap of trash.The only scene I found interesting is that Shining scene, but even that is incredibly short-lived as it's followed by a nonsensical dancing zombie platforming sequence.I also don't understand why they're working so hard in real life to create a treadmill for virtual gaming. Surely a hamster-ball type contraption would abide by the laws of physics. Also, people are walking the streets playing by the end of the film, yet none of them seem to bump into each other or any of the real-life objects in their way despite being such a huge mob, and characters are clearly shown playing via mouse and keyboard earlier, which would be a much safer and effective method than walking around in the real world. The tech simply doesn't make sense if you think about it.This film is yet another lacking creativity to come from Steven Spielberg in recent years, and will surely only be a blast for nostalgia-tripping 90s kids and the least demanding of casual movie-goers alike.",1,2,4,21 August 2018
Suicide Squad," The worst Oscar-winning film of all time
","On my first viewing, I thought this film was okay, and on second viewing I proceeded to slap the stupid out of myself until my head nearly fell off, and it's such a dull mess that I don't even know where to begin, but I will attempt to do so nonetheless.Here's the good, and it's going to be very short. Harley Quinn was excellent in this film and she gets a lot of screen time, and she feels like the only character even attempting to make this a fun experience. Margot Robbie's performance is probably the only reason I was fine with the film in the first place, but it's not a good excuse.Every other character is dark and gritty, wallowing in their self-pity, and they're all a bit despicable. Deadshot is probably the second best, being mediocre and not so offensive as the others, however the film focuses on him as the main character essentially though he was not interesting enough to carry the film. He's an impossibly skilled assassin who's also a father going through a divorce while his ex-wife is an irresponsible mother, which is essentially the same thing we see in every Oscar-baiting drama ever made. Killer Croc is probably the worst simply since he gets no development or depth at any point which is a missed opportunity at morbid cannibalistic humor. Diablo is probably the only character with development, however it happens much too late in the film and the reveal comes off as contrived, and leaves him being the least active character up until the end of the film. Boomerang is simply as bland as his name sounds. Katana shows up later than the rest of the squad, and her gimmick is a sword that traps souls and has her husband's soul trapped inside, and there's no payoff to this revelation and she hardly has any screen time. There's another guy called Slipknot, the man who can climb anything, and he is the only character not to get an introduction, so it's painfully obvious that he's entirely expendable.The introduction of the film is a complete mess right out of the gate. There are literally two introductions for the main cast done back to back with popular music tossed in, making it come off as a cheap fan-made music video. There are several origin stories blasting through at the speed of light here, combining the superhero film fatigue, origin story fatigue, and whiplash of terrible pacing all together into a projectile vomit-inducing concoction.The basic plot is horribly cliche and contrived. First of all, the main conflict in the story is caused by Waller in her creation of the Suicide Squad, which isn't a concept that made any sense in the first place. Why would she think it to be a good idea to put together a team of rowdy baddies to 'fight the next Superman' in case he were to be bad?Seriously, I understand they wanted a fun movie with bad guys being forced to fight together for good and subvert our expectations of villains, but none of that is executed effectively. Enchantress also has the MacGuffin, yada yada, giant light in the sky, and she's overpowered, leading to a dull final confrontation at the end. The monsters throughout the movie were also incredibly dull, as they were just guys in suits with weird black orbs all over their bodies, undoubtedly for the PG-13 rating.This really should have been a hard R, especially considering it came after Deadpool. It feels like a dull DP ripoff that's constantly pulling its punches since it's more concerned with marketability rather than entertainment. There's also edgy content with the Joker and Harley that feels forced. The scene in the strip club served no purpose beyond tossing in more sex appeal and killing off another character from the comics within a minute of first being shown on the big screen.The editing is incredibly jarring. The relationship between Joker and Harley was clearly edited to make the relationship seem more mutual, and thus it truly ruins the Joker's character beyond making him into a thug. There is a moment when Joker pushes Harley out of a helicopter, but it's cut in a way to reframe it to be like he was saving her and sacrificing himself instead of a morbid prank where he was trying to push her to cause harm.This Joker is clearly the worst Joker to date, which is hilarious considering how much insanity there was with Jared Leto around this film. After all his insane real life harassment and supposed method acting, all there is to show for it is what feels like five minutes of total screen time and only one line that can even be considered a joke. He acted as nothing more than a plot device for a couple of scenes with Harley Quinn that weren't the least bit important to the story ultimately, thus he was useless to the film and would have almost been better cut out entirely. Jared Leto's an overhyped person in general who claims to be an actor and a musician despite producing no quality performances for either line of work.It's hilarious that people defend this film so strongly as it's the sloppiest pile of garbage DC has offered us so far, and the one good aspect of it is simply not enough to make up for the countless flaws throughout by a long shot.",1,1,2,28 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Ships Have Dongs
","The Rise of Skywalker struggles to pull this trilogy together following the derailment of The Last Jedi, and what results is a lackluster finale that wastes plenty of time literally piecing together the broken remnants of a setup that was never promising in the first place. What is pretty epic though is that our boy JJ included some phallic imagery to remind us of how the patriarchy keeps us down even to this day. The imperial star destroyers now have giant 'underbelly cannons,' if you catch my drift. They're hung like horses for sure. Psst, they're the new death stars, again, in case that trope wasn't tired after Return of the Jedi.It's hard to pinpoint one aspect that really sucks about this film, as it's more a culmination of thorough mediocrity. I can't really appreciate that this film tries re-railing the plotthreads in the previous film if the ultimate product is still a trainwreck just because it minimized the damages. I was out of hope in the trilogy by the end of Last Jedi, and by the end of this I feel I've been proven right. In a way this film is worse because it's not even fun to look at - many scenes are downright hideous, especially the abysmal sky battle towards the end with the dark ships fighting at night-time in the middle of a massive storm. I would sooner rewatch Last Jedi five times than watch this once more despite this film being ten minutes shorter.Firstly, I feel JJ Abrams is a massively overrated director. His recent films, which are probably his best, feel like knockoff Spielberg without the emotional resonance or character depth, so probably akin to Ready Player One Spielberg rather than Jaws Spielberg. While he's not incompetent to the degree of Michael Bay, his films come off as if they think they're clever than they actually are, and this is most apparent in the dialogue. Now, JJ is only one of four writers, but as a director he's in charge of making his vision come to life, and a massive part of that is in the characters. These characters don't feel distinct. If they were all clones of each other, I wouldn't bat an eye. There's a scene where jetpack troopers prompt three of our heroes to respond 'They FLY now?' in succession, which doesn't even make sense as a surprise anyways. Jetpack technology existed back as far as Attack of the Clones, if not earlier. There are many attempts at quips throughout the film, and very few land. In a way, the attempted humor is more cringeworthy than the childish writing of The Last Jedi, and that film had a 'your mom' joke in it.Going back to The Force Awakens, the film was essentially a soft reboot of the franchise with the mindset of 'out with the old and in with the new' while retreading the same ground as A New Hope. What resulted was exactly that, with this trilogy macking off of the original trilogy and killing off the majority of major characters and replacing them with our new cast. In a way, Force Awakens was a brilliant movie, giving people a taste of what the original Star Wars was with modern day visual effects. I'm not a fan of it, but I can understand how it can be entertaining. Rise of Skywalker has more story and originality to it, but it is so bland and unrefined that it isn't even entertaining at its surface level. Action sequences seem to start at their best towards the beginning of the film and progressively get worse as the film goes on, and an abundance of long talking sequences in between heavily weigh down a hopelessly lost trilogy. My favorite shot in the whole film is a short sequence of Rae running from Kylo's ship, and doing a backflip and cutting one of the wings with her lightsaber. It was well-paced, well-composed, and well-lit, and it thematically fit as a 'Star Wars' force moment. Later on, she has a duel with Kylo in a storm, and while the fight was largely tense, the scene frequently stalled with acrobatics and was much less clear than the earlier sequence. The rest of the sequences take place at night, and in a cave, where only occasional lightning strikes and blaster shots and lightsabers light small areas of the scenery. The space battle is too big to focus already, much like the chaos in The Phantom Menace, but the combination of poor lighting and dark ships make the whole experience thoroughly unenjoyable.The story, right from the fundamental title crawl, comes across as weak fan fiction. 'The dead speak!' I guess no one's ever really gone. At only 68 words, this is the shortest title crawl of the franchise. What it establishes is that Palpatine's back, Rey's training, and Kylo's searching for Palpatine. And then we're shown all of these things as is. I don't even understand what they were going for with Rae. She's such a frustrating character through this movie. She's so unfocused and stubborn in her training that she frequently gets her friends into bad situations by simply pursuing her own ambitions constantly.Princess Leia was handled likely as well as possible here. The use of unused footage wasn't too jarring, and gave the character an acceptable ending. C-3PO was fine, though his use as a MacGuffin seems tacked on, and R2-D2 and Rose are nearly non-existant in this film. Dio, the little conehead robot, offers nothing more than some unnecessary character development for BB-8. As far as dibbies go, this is one of the most extrenuous, and they try to feign purpose into him by making you feel bad for him essentially being an abused puppy-robot. It's the definition of manipulative and it stalls the plot.Bringing back Palpatine is the ultimate sign of creative bankruptcy here. I would almost rather having a time jump at the start of this film and starting fresh to juxtapose the immediacy of the previous film and to distance itself away from that story altogether, but Palpatine is easier because he's an established character that we understand, though he really should be dead. This is essentially retconning the original trilogy and trying to bring in some sort of hook for some of the people pushed away by the conclusion of The Last Jedi. This is compounded by a massive upscaling of his capabilities. Palpatine is now able to cast lightning on what seems to be thousands of ships at once, and Rae has to match him, which results in essentially two gods fighting with their insane superpowers, and in that way there's no tension because it's incredibly easy to turn it at any point to let the underdog hero win without much explanation, which absolutely happens here. The power of friendship overcoming baddies is really lame. Kylo is redeemed and dies, much like Vader, and there's even a sort of awkward nod to the incestuous kiss from the original trilogy in the form of Rae and Kylo.Towards the end of the film I was met with what I felt was the most obvious misstep, and it foreshadowed it so hard that it was all the more frustrating. A woman asks for Rae's last name, and what it felt like the film was leading into was for her to respond 'Palpatine,' as her ancestry doesn't define her as a person. She was able to overcome the dark side of the force in spite of Palpatine's claims. Nope. She looks off into the distance and sees Luke and Leia's force ghosts and responds with 'Skywalker.' There was a milder case of this earlier with General Hux. It seemed like the film was setting up another high-ranking baddie as the traitor, but it turns out that Hux was the traitor, and the other guy shoots him dead and reports that the traitor has been found. What immediately came to mind here was having Hux's lie actually be true in this scene, and have his execution be a cover for the executioner actually being the spy. It seemed like this is what JJ meant when he said '**** it' in that interview. Yeah, use Hux as a very minor plot device and discard him immediately after because whatever. It felt like more of a Rian Johnson approach, to just drive things into the ground just because he can, and hopefully surprise some viewers in the process.JJ Abrams says he felt beholden to Star Wars with The Force Awakens, and while I think it's much better to try to be creative I really don't think he's a good fit for large stories. His best film is 10 Cloverfield Lane which involves three characters trapped in a small bunker. The more characters and elements in it, the more there is that can go wrong, and if he just plays it safe it ends up being slow, boring, and uninspiring. At this point I'd rather let AI write these Star Wars movies.JJ seemed to pick up bad habits from Rian Johnson as well. Abrams takes the force connection thing to another level by allowing our two rivals to interact with each other's environments through this connection despite the physical distance between the two. Keep it simple. No reason to keep adding inexplicable abilities into the series.Thank JJ for not giving answers that he promised he'd give answers to. Would you expect anything else from the guy behind Lost?I feel like this is probably going to be the most poorly resonating Star Wars film of them all, so I'm just going to slap it with a 1/10 ahead of time to keep it simple. Though I probably won't watch the others multiple times anyways, I can almost guarantee I will never watch this one again of my own volition. You'll have to Clockwork Orange me to make me rewatch this. A dull ending to an awful trilogy. It's shocking how sloppy this film is given how safe it attempts to be, and it's unbelievable how frustrating this film manages to be as a result. It's nearly as insulting as The Last Jedi while being more dull than Attack of the Clones. Think about where this trilogy started, and think about where it ended up. Palpatine gets killed again. If you want a wordier review, I'll post it on my Letterboxd as there's a character limit on imdb.",1,10,15,20 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Stone Cold Lazy
","I'm going to be frank, I did not like Bohemian Rhapsody. The story writes itself, and that's part of the problem. There is very little effort put in and it feels like the director skimmed Freddy Mercury's Wikipedia page and whipped this film together as a cheap cash-grab on the legacy which Freddy made for himself with little care on providing a deep, respectful, and meaningful biopic on the legend of Queen.The biggest problem with this film is its blatant disingenuous nature, opting for Hollywood cliches over either fact-based story-telling or fantastical surreal execution. What results is a muddled mess which is neither true to life nor outrageous enough to capture the spirit of Freddy Mercury at any point, instead opting for a middle-ground that takes the shortcomings of both approaches with dull, drawn out bits of melodrama which never goes deeper than surface-level and moments of artistic liberty with about as much artism as Freddy the Hedgehog and as much liberty as North Korea. I find myself disgusted knowing that Sacha Baron Cohen's R-rated version of the film would have been much more interesting than what I'd watched, and I expressed the same concerns over Cohen's ideas that the surviving band members did. This film is so safe and laid back and set on preserving Freddy's image that it makes AIDS seem better than a common cold, and is filled with numerous sex scenes ripped straight from daytime television. To say that the film was sanitized would be an understatement; this film is about as uncomfortable with its homoerotic subject matter as Catholic priests are with adult women. The scene of Another One Bites the Dust was so dated in its portrayal of homoeroticism that I thought the movie should have been called Freddy Goes to Hollywood. With its PG-13 rating, there certainly could have been more done in terms of the sexuality, and especially given the Freddy's AIDS there certainly should have been much more touched on here and it should have been a bigger focus rather than the fluffy melodrama before this point. If you're going to do a film about a legend, it deserves only the best, deepest, most sincere telling one can give, especially when this film goes on to portray Freddy as a perfectionist and then hands the directorial duties over to Bryan Singer, director of mediocre, soulless, sub-par blockbusters such as X-Men: Apocalypse and Jack the Giant Slayer. If this film wanted to be a great one, it should have been more like Walk the Line, a serious and gritty film about the lives of those in the band, or it should have been Whiplash, a crazy wild ride that sacrifices realism in favor of bashing you over the head with stupid, stylish, vacuous, guilty-pleasure no-holds-barred entertainment.Rami Malek did an excellent job as Freddy Mercury, and the interactions between he and the bandmates are some of the only bits of livelihood in this otherwise paint-by-numbers Hollywood film. Though much of the melodrama was overlong and petty in the grand scheme of things, the actors did a fine job bringing scenes to life with some charm despite lackluster pacing and proper editing (Perhaps the filmmakers were running out of tape and had to make do with a single cut.). Malek brings an energy to Mercury that is miserably not met by any other element of the filmmaking process, and the creative overdubbing from multiple voices to mimic Mercury's is practically seamless and renders the aspects of the film outside of musical performances utterly trite in comparison, as I found myself struggling to stay invested in the in-between parts.The soundtrack is decent, but lacking a few staples in Queen's career. Notable exclusions are Stone Cold Crazy, Death on Two Legs, Bicycle Race, I Want It All, and One Vision, which are each among Queen's greatest tracks. Instead, we get two versions of Bohemian Rhapsody, Keep Yourself Alive, and The Show Must Go On. This could have easily been remedied with more focus on the music rather than petty infighting with the band, allowing more songs in the movie, and with less redundancy in the film itself regarding tracks which appear more than once. There is also a grave missed opportunity to portray David Bowie performing Under Pressure with Queen, which would have been incredible especially given Bowie's recent death and comparable legendary status as a musician. Instead, Bowie receives a single passing mention in the film and not a single legendary artist mentioned are shown performing (eg. Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, or even REO Speedwagon who hardly have much of a legacy to tarnish). Several songs are even out of order in the film, such as the second version of Seven Seas of Rhye, Fat Bottomed Girls, and Another One Bites the Dust.The inaccuracies are plentiful and too numerous and too important to ignore, especially given the pseudo-factual presentation of the film. Much creative liberty taken throughout the film's plot destroy the film's credibility throughout. In reality, Freddy discovered his condition after the Live Aid concert, and even the concert itself was no matter of difficulty as the band hadn't broken up, and Freddy's solo project was not a problem for the band, and Queen was not squeezed into Live Aid last minute as the film portrays, and Freddy did not give an emotional speech about his AIDS just prior to the performance, as all of these contrivances were added to appeal to the generic Hollywood drama formula. Even the formulation of the band is gratuitously simplified and given that boring ol' Hollywood sheen, and thus literally every element of the film must be brought into question as I truly believe at this point that not a single moment in this film is true to real life. Is this the real life? No. It's just fantasy, and the true shame is that it's not even a self-aware way, which would make such liberties borderline acceptable.If you want a great biopic about a legendary musician, watch Walk the Line, and if you're not interested in Johnny Cash then there's certainly nothing worth watching I suppose. If you liked this film, you're certainly allowed to, but many people I've seen praising this film simply love the band Queen and the soundtrack of the film and they overlook the unforgivable shortcomings of this shamefully lackluster motion picture. If you insist on bringing your family to this, you'll have to Tie Your Mother Down, otherwise she'll be leaving in offense as she grew up with Queen and truly cares about the legacy this film abysmally fails to tell.",3,9,18,28 November 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Mehgame
","While Endgame is a competent enough film with satisfying conclusions to many of the characters, it is also an incredibly frustrating film due to a number of fundamental issues. Also, I could have spoiled the title of this film after I saw Infinity War if I didn't know any better to think the callback to Doctor Strange's quote was gaucheThe film starts up with Hawkeye losing his entire family, and then with Tony and Nebula being saved in the middle of space by Captain Marvel, and once he is brought back to Earth he scolds Captain America for essentially causing half the universe to be wiped out for his freedom, when really it's equally his fault for not running off to work with Captain America. And Captain Marvel acts arrogant as usual as the Avengers call her out on it, leading me to believe that the film is true to the real animosity behind the set towards Brie Larson's attitude to her coworkers. Anyways, she brings them to where Thanos is and Thor kills him like the chump he is because I guess using the infinity gauntlet has tenderized his meat enough for him to be decapitated this time around. Captain Marvel then immediately leaves after saying there's thousands of other planets going through the same thing, even though Earth is the only one presumably working to undo the destruction of half the universe's population, which is possibly more important than Captain Marvel helping an elderly alien cross a street.Fast forward five years, and Scott is brought out of the quantum realm thanks to a rat stepping on the control panel, working both as an excellent cheap joke and as a deus ex machina. Scott has a character moment with his now teenaged daughter briefly before teaming up with Avengers and explaining how time travel is a possibility if one could navigate the quantum realm, which is now a possibility. But prior to this Captain America tries to teach people to look on the bright side. Scarlet Johansen manages emoting effectively for the first time in her entire acting career.Tony Stark has started a new life with Pepper, and the two now have a daughter. The team gives Tony a vial of Pym juice and explain their hopes of time travel and undoing Thanos' snap, but Tony mocks them for being so ridiculous given that he is the only one on the team who has lost nothing out of the whole ordeal, and he refuses to help. The team tasks Bruce for the job, and he has now managed to control the Hulk and the two work in unison now. Instead of creating time travel, they manage to push time through Scott, aging and de-aging him before returning him to normal and playing the whole discovery off as a joke rather than what it actually is; the key to immortality. Tony, in mere seconds of screentime, uncovers the secret to time travel and the team is off to the races. New Asgard is a run-down mess with the few Asgardian survivors, and worse yet, Thor has become a morbidly obese drunkard due to PTSD, and this is a running joke throughout the movie. Black Widow recruits Hawkeye as he cosplays as her in the live-action Ghost in the Shell film, slaying criminals in cold blood, I guess. This is a short interaction despite these being two of the most important characters in the film. I guess it's more important for Black Widow to be making the same jokes about Rocket Raccoon throughout the film rather than explore her character more, but I suppose they have to save material for the upcoming Black Widow film.
They plan out their time travel shenanigans. They have only enough Pym juice for a round trip each, until they conveniently grab more later from the past, however, since this is an action film, it would be unacceptable for this to be treated as a heist, and instead there has to be huge mistakes in each part of their plan in sequences that are so disparately linked that the brisk pace becomes jarring and awkward, and scenes stop flowing together the way they did in Infinity War. Many interactions occur between characters which would have been impossible without this time travel, one of which being an encounter between Tony and a 70s version of his father, which might be satisfying if it weren't so contrived. There are many nods to previous films which are mostly charming, but unfortunately similar to Terminator: Genisys. Captain America has an interesting fight with himself, with younger him mistaking present him as Loki in disguise. But Captain America says 'Bucky is alive' to distract younger Captain, which seems a bit too reckless if time-travel logic were taken with any form of sincerity in this film. Nebula and Falcon knock out Star-Lord from the beginning of Guardians of the Galaxy, which might possibly even lead to his death considering what happens after this moment in the original film. The most infuriating of all has to be when Black Widow and Hawkeye learn they must sacrifice someone they love to get the soul stone, which is knowledge Tony should have, as he was within earshot of the conversation of Gamora's death in the previous film. I guess Stark has no respect for a man who has lost his family, and was sending Hawkeye there to die, but instead Black Widow sacrifices herself. Even worserer, Nebula gets hacked via what appears to be a crossed wifi signal and Thanos learns of the plans, and a switcheroo is done for past Nebula to infiltrate the Avengers' base. On a positive note, Hulk has a great interaction the Ancient One in which we learn that Doctor Strange gave Thanos the stone willingly just to convince her to give Hulk the stone at that moment, which is perhaps the only intriguing use of time travel in the film.Anyways, Hulk does the snap and it nearly kills him despite being nearly immune to gamma radiation, yet Thanos faired better with killing half the universe and then destroying the stones with their own power which was possible apparently. And then the team gets ambushed by Thanos and nearly die, even though they should all be dead considering they were blasted before all but one of them realized the threat, which leads to another big fight with Thanos, where literally everyone who was snapped away comes back and has their moment to shine kicking Thanos' ass for a couple seconds before being shown to be a chump.Captain Marvel shows up to save the day about twenty minutes into the fight to decide the fate of the entire universe, and takes out Thanos' battleship in mere seconds, but this is the kind of thing that thousands of planets across the universe are going through all the time and they don't have a regular guy with a powersuit to help them with it thus Captain Marvel was too busy to defeat Thanos I guess, even though according to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige she's stronger than Thanos, which, much to Anita Sarkeesian's dismay is disproven as Danvers is taken out with a single punch from vanilla Thanos, just like everybody else on the team. Somehow 2014 Thanos feels stronger than Thanos was with all of the infinity stones, which makes sense if you also consider that Danvers became stronger than all of the infinity stones by being blasted by the energy from a single infinity stone. What I'm trying to say is the MCU has become knockoff Dragon Ball Super with a massive powercreep problem in which all of the heroes are now so powerful that the enemies have to be even more powerful to maintain the underdog feel, and it's a confusing mess that you might as well turn your brain off for. Whatever, Captain America says 'Avengers assemble' so rule of cool I guess.Anyways, there's a nod to an upcoming all-female superhero flick which reminds me of the Ghostbusters reboot. And then Tony tricks Thanos by doing a bait and switch and states 'I am Iron Man,' then snaps the army away, and he somehow lives long enough to have a moment with Pepper and Spider-Man.Iron Man gets a pretty decent funeral and a post-mortem moment with his family via a pre-recorded message. Then Captain America goes back in time to return the infinity stones, and ends up spending his life with Peggy, which I suppose means he was her unnamed husband from the past in the previous films. He returns old and passes his shield on to Falcon. The time travel from the Incredible Hulk has greater implications than one might think. The problem is Hulk has essentially discovered immortality, though it's brushed off as a joke and a terrible mistake. There's another major problem with this; we've brought back alternate Gamora from 2014 and killed 2014's Nebula, doing a switcheroo, but we end up with both, essentially undoing Gamora's death from Infinity War. We can undo all other permanent deaths by bringing the deceased from alternate timelines into this one.
By the way, several dead-dead characters are back despite still being considered dead, which doesn't make the switcharoo feel like any less of a cop-out. Quill is left with a Gamora who hasn't experienced anything with him, but that will certainly be sorted out in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.
While Endgame is a relatively competent film, it has many positives and negatives which can make it a polarizing experience for fans, plebs, and snobs alike. There are numerous moments which are both memorable and satisfying, but there's others that are wholly unimmersive and disappointing. While Tony Stark's death was wholly expected, Black Widow's feels bizarre. The heroes' capabilities now are so grand that they together are almost omnipotent, and yet somehow vanilla Thanos was still able to beat them in a fight without the infinity stones despite Thor kicking his ass in Infinity War when he had all the stones. Basically, the MCU has become Dragon Ball Super, and what with their super safe approach we can expect a whole lotta fan service for fans of each individual character regardless of what their power levels should be. Ant-Man expanding inside Thanos would have made for a much better climax.",6,0,1,28 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel doesn't fail to deliver
","Of all Marvel films, this is the one where I really expected them to drop the ball. There seems to simply be too many main characters in the universe to make a coherent and satisfying film out of, however I would say they accomplished it.Not a moment is wasted, but the film doesn't feel like it's rushing all the same. It feels like just enough time is given for each scene to develop each character, and though more could have been done and perhaps 3 hours or more would be more appropriate, it's a very clean and satisfying film that defies expectations. Perhaps the second part will fill out what remains to be explored, and that would bring it to a more reasonable 5 hours, and this film was more just half a story anyways.This is one of the most dramatic Marvel films to date with the typical humor toned down a bit as to not interfere with the darker aspects, which surely sets it above Doctor Strange in terms of consistency, though the Guardians of the Galaxy are as goofy as ever, which is also neat since all the characters still feel as they did in previous films, which could have easily been muddled with how many directors have brought this universe to this point.Thanos is probably my favorite MCU villain to date, as he has strong, logical motivations, which is admittedly uncommon among most superhero villains. Though he is definitively a villain, one can see things from his perspective, and can sympathize with him. He may be a bad guy, but his ideologies are not contrived but rather fleshed out in a believable way and shown clearly. It's quite interesting to me how Marvel has now seemed to shift to having the superior villains as opposed to DC.One of the worst things about this film is actually the trailer, which spoils the climax of the film. This isn't the first time either. Civil War's trailer spoiled two critical plot points in the film, which can be a huge problem when it takes all of the tension out of a scene since you've seen the outcome before the movie even started.I'd strongly recommend this film, though I'd highly recommend watching as many of the previous films as possible to make this film a bit more consumable. It is a bit dizzying, but that's surely not a deal-breaker given that it's so competently executed.",8,2,7,2 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Excellent
","Quentin Tarantino's supposed ninth film (Not separately counting the two volumes of Kill Bill) shows that there's plenty of stories yet to be told, in some of the most surprisingly simple places. Whether it be a journey to space to stop baddies from destroying the good guys, or a crew of strong folk stopping a purple alien from using a MacGuffin to destroy the universe, I find myself instead more interested in whatever that new film from that weird guy who does things just because 'they're so much fun.' Certainly there's an important place for routine and predictable in any business model, but so long as I have my small selection of 'nuanced, yet anything but pompous' products to flap my lips about I'll continue to enjoy my pursuit of creative works.
Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood is certainly not Tarantino's best film, but that's merely a testament to how talented the man truly is to produce such reliably fantastic products seemingly effortlessly. Tarantino's certainly flexing his knowledge of classic films and television in this feature in particular, and as such I could only imagine my enjoyment of this film growing in the future with consumption of such products myself. While the film-within-the-film gimmick is anything but new, its execution in this film feels exceptionally genuine and offers much insight into the goings-on of filmmaking and more than ever before allows me to understand the problems and the struggles of those in the entertainment industry, be they of varying degrees of success. What results is essentially Quentin Tarantino's BoJack Horseman. There's a riffing segment akin to something out of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and though it's brief, it feels like Tarantino's got a vast understanding as to successful formulas and why they were proven successful as well as how to implement them into his projects if only to pay homage and show he's incredibly versatile.
This may not be the most dramatic film of the year, but it could very well be the funniest and the most suspenseful. While horror films typically struggle making superpowered and supernatural monsters scary, Tarantino manages to make simple human beings intimidating and terrifying simply through his vision and direction. While horror films rely on scare chords and cliché violins, Tarantino's audio tracks build tension within the scene to sell the brilliant performances from his peculiar, yet perfectly fitting casts. The film also manages to nearly constantly subvert expectations in the most cleverly excusable of ways. While Rian Johnson will stop at nothing to surprise the audience and M. Night Shyamalan gives out the surprises that everyone has come to expect, Tarantino's films are truly exciting unlike any others. Watching many films, and all Tarantino films, there are many expectations that come with each setup in this film given the often eerie music and the suspicious framing at times, and it always comes as a surprise, even in the rare chance that the film does exactly what you had predicted, and I find myself shocked to realize that I didn't lose immersion once, like a magician pulling off a stunning misdirection. Say what you will about Tarantino as a person, but when it comes to making a film the man's a brilliant magician. To then work back through the film in my head, I would find the real magic is that it all makes sense, and the resulting product feels organically unpredictable, like a particularly crazy day in anyone's life. I'm further impressed to find myself unable to recall a decision that was made reminiscent to any silly moments present in several of Tarantino's previous films. This feature is decidedly more careful and subdued than previous ventures, and while Tarantino's staples are not absent they serve more as a garnish rather than a main course in and of themselves this time around. Once Upon a Time... may not be exciting like Django or Kill Bill, or as impactful as Pulp Fiction, but it has a surprising maturity to it that, while not paving much new ground, can set it alongside some of the great classics of the era it is set in.
Skeptics may be pleasantly surprised by the acting performances. While this certainly is an all-star cast, others may find Pitt or DiCaprio to be over-rated pretty boys with limited acting ranges, which may be somewhat true, but I might question how much of this is due to talent and how much is due to typecasting and direction. From watching numerous films, I find direction to be much more important than innate acting talent, as one might say Margot Robbie stands out in comparison to her costars in Suicide Squad, but such a statement isn't enough to make a respectable performance, otherwise she might have been considered for such an award. I've never seen this vulnerable side of DiCaprio until Tarantino brought it out in this film, because this is really the first time a DiCaprio role has demanded it, and it's truly welcome and though DiCaprio isn't the most fantastic dramatic actor, he certainly provided more compelling melodrama than I would have expected going in. I would still pit Will Arnett's performance as BoJack Horseman much higher for such a similar character, but for someone who has made a career in a very different department, DiCaprio certainly does better than 'good enough.' Brad Pitt's performance, while being somewhat one-note, plays off of DiCaprio's very well. Pitt's character, Cliff, while being twisted and somewhat pathetic is an oddly intriguing sidekick, giving the pessimistic yet thoroughly better off Rick Dalton some much needed support while allowing two completely different yet similar characters for the audience to latch onto while maintaining their individual personalities throughout the film almost to a fault, where character development feels much more like a slight adjustment rather than a Hollywood-style epiphany.
The tie-ins with real-life events and people are somewhat surreal and intriguing in a way only Tarantino could pull off, much like he managed with Hitler in Inglorious Basterds. Being one who wasn't too familiar with the details of the Manson Family murders, I found myself fascinated with the characters' appearance in the film and importance in the main story. There are certainly many creative liberties taken as the main duo manage to kill three of these maniacs towards the climax of the film in a hilariously grotesque sequence akin to the most graphic moments of John Wick: Chapter 3. There's another scene in which Cliff kicks Bruce Lee's ass for running his mouth about being able to beat Ali in a fight, and though the many impersonations are somewhat unprofessional, they are incredibly charming and fit with the comedy-drama tone of the film. Tarantino has a knack for making twisted comedy out of real life tragedies without it coming off as terribly tasteless as the material is taken very seriously when it needs to be, even if it manages to be awkwardly funny or silly with some alternate reality stuff thrown in the mix at times.
I can understand that this is not a film for everyone. Casual moviegoers and perhaps teenagers might be bored by the subject matter and slow, methodical pacing of this film, but I found it to be thoroughly engaging and fascinating. As I've said before, it's similar to BoJack Horseman with a twist of Tarantino (who was parodied in the show, oddly enough. Perhaps he caught wind of the series this way.). If you go into this without the expectation of a Tarantino film you'll perhaps be more likely to enjoy this film for what it is, but it's certainly more of a substance over style film. There are few special effects compared to today's blockbusters, and much of the story is about the nuanced elements rather than a complex web of plotlines. The lives of celebrities are explored in ways that I haven't seen explored in film, but given the beefy 161 minute runtime, Tarantino finds the time to explore these aspects from several people's perspectives without any of it feeling glossed over or useless. One might not get the point of the focus on Sharon Tate's self-obsession in a ten minute sequence focused on her going to see a film she starred in to garner approval from a movie-going audience, but the narcissistic aspect of stardom is certainly an aspect which is at least touched on even though Dalton's ultimately the main focus of the story and Sharon's quite literally a background character up until the conclusion of the film. If it were notably botched at any point, I might see her character as extraneous, but she ultimately added to the experience.
The setting is beautiful and this may be one of my favorite throwback type films. From the retro Taco Bell to the 60s fashions and automobiles, it's all incredibly immersive. There was what appeared to be a single exterior shot of a CGI airplane at one point, but outside of that the film successfully brought me into the world as it was when the story is meant to take place. The acting outside of the acting-within-acting at times felt silly, but the acting-within-acting was so on-the-nose cliché for the most part that it seemed that Tarantino truly understood the reality of the matter. The fake scenes you are shown within the film feel authentic to classic television and film and they all have a similar disingenuity to them that we have grown to love from cheesy action films. Certainly, the acting is obviously acting, but were it realistic, it might come off as lazy, which at times it does in this film, which makes it feel more authentic. In other words, sometimes thinking too hard and trying too hard negatively impacts films, especially nowadays where we've come to shut our brains off at cliches lest they be shown in a context where they make sense, as they are in this film.
All in all, I adore this film and would recommend it to most people, more so than perhaps older Tarantino flicks as this one is a bit more relaxed and careful than prior films. In other words, grandma [...]",9,16,34,31 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Minimalistic horror. Nuanced, refined, and staunchly impactful.
","It's amazing in this day and age that we could come up with a fresh new idea for a horror film considering how awful the vast majority turn out to be, and even more impressive that it's such a basic concept. Sure, it may be similar to Tremors, but it's significantly different to give a unique spin.The premise is simple - There's monsters that can't see, they eat humans, and they can hear very well. The main thing that sets this apart from Tremors is the fact that sound is the issue rather than vibrations through the ground, and as such the characters live their lives as quietly as possible, communicating through nothing more than whispers and sign language. Unfortunately, this is also a major shortcoming of the film, as it has to take some liberties with exactly how the sound works, as actions seem to be taken at time for nothing more than narrative reasons rather than intelligent problem solving, and many explanations left missing in the theatrical release, such as how they have a power generator without attracting these monsters to their location. However, I feel the execution more than makes up for most of these shortcomings.The emotional aspect is surprisingly effective, and is without a doubt the main element that pushes this above the usual 7 from me. The despair and themes in this film are comparable to The Witch, though toned down to a PG-13 level. We follow the lives of a small family trying to get by in a world where noise means certain death. The couple's daughter is practically deaf, and this is set up perfectly for offing her little brother early in the film. He explains to her that they're going to escape by rocket ship, and he's seen trying to turn on a toy rocket, to which he's told not to as it's too loud, however, the daughter gives the toy back to the kid, to which the kid pockets the batteries to put back in it later. Due to her deafness, she is oblivious as her brother turns on the toy, and later burdens herself with his death. In a rather depressing scene, she disables the noise mechanism in the toy, brings it to the boy's grave, and leaves it upon it. It's kind of embarrassing getting emotional at the world's most quiet film, as everyone can undoubtedly hear you sniveling at the manipulative dramatic elements, but I'll be damned if it doesn't still get me. It encapsulates that helpless feeling of knowing you could have done better and blaming yourself for the death of a loved one, which is a feeling I'm all too familiar with. In a rather muddled scene, her dad sets the record straight with her that he doesn't blame her for the death, and then sacrifices himself to save two of his remaining children. I get what they wanted to go for here, but they should not have given him a shovel in this scene, as that gave him a clear option of using it as a distraction rather than doing the last resort. Rather than tossing the shovel at the metal silo nearby, he gently drops it straight down and screams to give away his exact position. The gripes I have are a numerous amount of small issues. The white board in which the dad is brainstorming has 'What is THE WEAKNESS?' written on it as a visual clue to use later in the film once they find the weakness, though no one in their right mind would remind their self that they should be searching for the answer to all of their problems, as it simply goes without saying. The weakness, while not a dealbreaker, toes the lines of a cheesy plot twist, though in the end it does make sense, and is in fact quite obvious prior to the actual revelation. There is also a scene where the dad scurries out of the house to find his children, walking right past a massive leak without noticing it, and this mistake actually turns beneficial by the end of it as it provides a bit of a sound barrier for the mother to hide with her baby when the a creature breaks in, which seems like a bit of plot convenience.The sound design is excellent, ironically enough. Aside from a few cheap jumpscares with typical scare chords and loud noises tossed in (about half of them, the other half just being purely visual horror), the film is people being very quiet, and there's an occasional ambient song. It's almost entrancing, and certainly not something I've experienced from a film. There aren't too many jumpscares at all, and they certainly didn't make the film unenjoyable. It's a surprisingly restrained film in an age of trite.All in all, it was an excellent movie-going experience and one that I highly recommend. It would probably be better on home release due to how quiet and ambient it is throughout. Kudos to Krasinski. Now, without further ado, branch out, far away from Michael Bay. You're way too talented for the likes of him!",7,5,10,19 May 2018
Sausage Party," Terrible practices behind the sets
","Sausage Party isn't an all around bad movie, but the treatment of the animators wouldn't be out of place in a list of the most terrible atrocities committed by mankind, which is why I have to award this film with the lowest score possible. Animators were forced to work unpaid overtime at threat of blacklisting.There's a number of funny gags and one-liners throughout the movie, but it's got some serious flaws that are a staple of Seth Rogan films. A huge portion of the film is dedicated to stoner comedy, and I'd hate to break it to you, but stoner comedy is not funny.The animation is nice, and the film has a number of funny gags throughout, but it has some serious pacing issues right in the middle where it drags for a significant chunk of the movie. The ending is also stupid and pointlessly sets up a sequel that already sounds as shallow as its cliched setup.",1,2,4,6 August 2018
Whiplash," It's the drill instructor from Full Metal Jacket as a jazz instructor.
","Whiplash is a great film for a few reasons, the same reasons for which it won its corresponding awards. J.K. Simmons does an excellent performance, the sound design is excellent, and the editing is excellent. Beyond this, there is nothing particularly excellent in the film, and a number of elements to find fault though the pros largely outweigh the cons.Probably the most interesting aspect of the film is J.K. Simmons' performance as Terence Fletcher, a ruthless jazz instructor. Every moment that he is on screen is intense and often comical in a very cruel way, almost to a comical degree. His character is basically that of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket, throwing vulgar insults at his students without hesitation. Thankfully, he's a huge part of this film, thus he is allowed to carry it drastically. He's a lot of fun, and his performance is one of the most high energy performances I have seen this decade. Miles Teller did a fine job as Andrew Neiman, but he is largely overshadowed by his antagonizing instructor.The editing also played a huge role in the entertainment value of this film. The pacing felt just about perfect, which is especially important in a musical film. The beats through the film are almost rhythmic, making the film seem fully realized in its premise, elevating it far above the usual mediocrity, which also aids in Fletcher's attempts at beating perfection out of his students. It's a thoroughly exciting film largely in part to the editing. It truly is thoroughly exciting and quite inspirational in an extremely tough, critical way that has almost become extinct in today's politically correct society.The sound design is an extremely important aspect in a musical film, and it's certainly excellent in this film. There are no distracting elements throughout the film, as everything is right at the level it needs to be. The soundtrack is as intense as the film itself, and is never overwhelmed by external sources, even with Fletcher throwing in insults during live performances. Aside from one intentionally stylized sequence, the visuals perfectly match the audio in the musical performances throughout, and there are moments in which the film isn't afraid to shake things up and provide us with scenarios in which the main character messes up performances for specific reasons, such as injury, or being made to play a piece he couldn't have known prior, and the results are suitably bad in a believable way.One gripe I have with this film is just how unbelievable the circumstances are. I cannot suspend my disbelief as in reality someone like Fletcher would most certainly be immediately fired, and likely sued on top of that. Not only is he verbally abusive throughout the film, but he is also physically violent as well. There's a scene where he slaps our main character repeatedly to train him to keep proper tempo, and this simply wouldn't fly in real life, especially not in a large class like Fletcher's. Not only this, but he also demands the drummers to play as fast as they can for literally hours until their hands are bleeding significantly during one practice session. Beyond this, he also kicks and tosses furniture around, sometimes at students, and his excuse for this is that a famous musician, Charlie Parker, didn't become great until he was 'nearly decapitated' with a cymbal thrown at him. This is however grossly exaggerated, as the cymbal was thrown at Parker's feet. While I can accept Fletcher's reasoning for tough love and the harm in saying 'good job' to a talented individual, as complacency is the death of art and a huge problem especially in this day and age.Fletcher's critical attitude seems very unrealistic to me. Fletcher's ability to determine tempo with microscopic accuracy almost comes off as a super power. While I could agree with him at times, at others he would flip out for something that by any reasonable standards was close enough to be indiscernible. The movie almost devolved into insanity as it made a simple beat out to be the most impossible task in the entire world.The plot isn't all too engaging either. It's simple, and is serviceable, but it didn't astonish me. The ending was largely unsatisfying, as the main character felt less triumphant and more so like a battered housewife with Stockholm Syndrome. Fletcher doesn't quite get his comeuppance, and Neiman doesn't quite stand up for himself. It's simply not all that satisfying, and the one moment where Neiman finally breaks down and attacks Fletcher is too light and too short-lived to make it satisfying.Most other elements were fine but not beyond fine. Supporting characters were sort of just there, and didn't really add more to the film rather than being stand-ins or human punching bags for Fletcher. It's almost odd that as the movie goes on, Fletcher seems to ignore all of his other students and simply focuses on Neiman with all of his attention and criticism by the end.I would recommend this movie to just about anybody, except grandma perhaps, as she might find the language offensive. It's certainly interesting enough to watch either on a casual level or a critical level.",9,0,0,31 May 2018
12 Strong," 2 Long
","This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers.",1,197,408,28 January 2018

","All in all, The Incredibles 2 isn't a bad movie, but compared to the original it is unexceptional in every aspect. The original felt like it was constantly taking big risks and trying ambitious and interesting scenes throughout it, and as a result the final product was one of the most fun and engaging family films of all time. The sequel on the other hand felt safe, generic, and surprisingly boring. The plot made sense, but it simply wasn't incredible by any means, choosing instead to be mostly a slice of life film, and the drama is pulled from X-Men, going for politics and oppression, but it's more of a distraction than anything else.The main cast was fine with a few nitpicks to make here and there, though none of the out-of-character moments were significant enough to pull me out of the film. The gimmick with this film is that it's essentially a flip of the first film with Elastigirl in Mr. Incredible's place while Mr. Incredible stays home and takes care of the kids. Oddly enough, the most interesting scenes were the ones in which Mr. Incredible is interacting with the rest of the family, despite how boring that might sound for a superhero film, but at least such scenes have charm to them. Mr. Incredible's jealousy was a bit overdone, however it wasn't long-lived enough to become obnoxious. The voice acting was great, aside from Holly Hunter, as her voice was much more whistly than it was 14 years ago, as well as her accent becoming a tad more Sean Connery-y.The plot is very basic. It's odd that it's being sold as this big thing that took 14 years to make when obviously they were working on other things instead while this sequel was on the backburner. If you ever expect the movie to go in a certain way, you'll be absolutely correct. It might be one of the most predictable films of all time. There's also the issue of repetition, as every action scene basically boils down to 'big vehicle will cause mass destruction if we don't shut it down in time,' first with the Underminer, then with the runaway train, and the cruise ship at the climax. Elastigirl is the hero for most of the film until at the end they have to learn to work together and put their powers to use to defeat a greater enemy, just like in the first film. It is especially frustrating when the kids point this out to her at the very start of the film, especially since this film takes place only three months after the previous film, and she refuses to listen to them until the end.The humor is pretty decent and the film has a decent charm to it even during its worst moments. One of the major detriments is that a lot of the humor is safe and predictably effective, such as Jack-Jack doing dumb baby things throughout. Sure, seeing him fighting a raccoon is very entertaining, as is the interdimensional stuff, but it's ultimately used as a replacement for writing an intriguing story.The villain, Screenslaver, was not great in my opinion. She pales greatly in comparison to Syndrome from the first film, who might be one of the greatest villains of all time. Screenslaver's motivation feels incredibly weak, especially since she's directly contrasted by her brother who went through exactly the same loss as she did, except he had a rational reaction to the situation. She also helps Elastigirl in legalizing superheroes at first so she can flip it and the idea is that reillegalizing superheroes will make it so they stay illegal forever, but it just seems incredibly stupid how she's hoist with her own petard.The feminist angle didn't feel like much of a thing in this film really, despite what the Buzzfeed copycats report. I'm sure it will be obnoxious to many others, but it felt subtle enough to be natural in the context of the film, which is rare in current year. but If anything, the villain Screenslaver is a bit feminist, though since she's the main villain, it's hardly an empowering role. Void is kind of SJW-ish I suppose, but she's got a few minutes of screen time, so whatever.I also felt there was a serious pacing issue throughout this film. I would never have expected this film to be nearly as boring as it was, but it was actually mindnumbing when I realized I was watching the fifth scene in a row with zero action. None of the talkshow stuff interested me, as the side characters were just one-dimensional garbage, even if that was intended to be satire on dumb hosts, but all of the new characters that Elastigirl interacts with kind of suck. The only one who's developed is Screenslaver, and she's horrifically stereotypical, thus their conversations are dull.The special effects are beautiful, as one might guess, and certainly an improvement to the first film, though the first film was more mindblowing for its time given the lesser technology back then. Some of the artistic choices are a bit questionable, as I feel Elastigirl is now heavily sexualized given her new flashy suit and the frequent low-angle rear shots. It almost feels like rather than taking the Shrek route of tossing in innuendos for the adults, they just took the easy route of framing each shot to emphasize sexual traits. I'm also rather desensitized to special effects as most animated films look beautiful nowadays, but lack interesting plots, and this film unfortunately falls into that category.Incredibles 2 is good, but it isn't phenomenal, and hardly deserves its title. It's ultimately lackluster, but it has good moments sprinkled throughout it, and it is worth a watch if you're interested in nice animated films or the original film, but otherwise I would think it to be boring and dull.",6,1,4,18 June 2018
