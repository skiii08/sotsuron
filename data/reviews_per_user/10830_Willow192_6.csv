The Blair Witch Project," 'I'm so scared right now.'
","Maybe she's scared...but I sure as heck wasn't.  The movie wasn't scary at all.  'OMG!  f--k f--k mother f--ker, it's the f--king wind!  RUN!!!!!!'. This is the most overrated piece of tripe I have ever seen.  Ok...lets get some kids off of the street.  Then we're gonna give them cameras and tell them to run with them, bouncing them as much as possible...while screaming f--k every other word.  Why was this movie allowed to be made?  Where did all of that money go?!  This movie looked like it cost about 100 bucks...and that's for the camera.  All you hear in this whole movie is rustling and cussing.  Where is the horror?  And the worst thing is that a whole bunch of people liked it!!!  And then they made a sequel...  You couldn't pay me enough money to stay through it.  This is a cure for insomnia.  The first 10 minutes start out slow and it's only gets worse from there.  It seems as if they didn't even have a script, and there was no camera work or direction of any kind.  The movie was too long.  If I had it my way, the movie would have been 20 minutes.  And even that's too long.  Don't see this movie.  Avoid it at ALL COSTS!!!  You have been forewarned...0 out of 10.",Null,0,1,23 March 2001
American Beauty," Look Closer...
","When I first saw this movie I instantly fell in love with it.  It was after the Oscars (American Beauty won for Best Movie) so I figured...it must be good.  Even though I don't usually like movies that get so much hype.  I know I'm a little young to be in love with a movie like this but hey...what the heck?  The movie is basically about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) going through kind of a mid-life crisis like stage in his life, to try to change it for the better so that it is more enjoyable.  Although I thought his relationship with Angela (Mina Suvari) was kind of disgusting...I'm glad that they didn't take it to a place that was down right tasteless. 
All of the actors in this movie were well casted.  Kevin Spacey played the title character...Lester Burnham..a 40 something year old man just looking for a little bit of realism and happiness in his seemingly perfect life. Annette Bening excellently portrayed Carolyn Burnham, A suburban wife trying to seem perfect to everyone on the outside.  In this desperate attempt to please people, she doesn't really please herself until she has a lusty affair with Buddy aka The 'Real-estate King.'  While doing this she completely ignores her husband and her daughter, Jane.  Jane is played by Thora Birch, who is IMO a wonderful actress.  This is a new kind of role for Thora, who is usually playing a little sweetheart.  But she does a wonderful job playing the confused, and bitterly unhappy Jane.  Someone that most teenagers can relate to.Right next door live the Fitts family.  They, also putting on an act for everyone.  Well, all of them except for Ricky played so wonderfully by newcomer Wes Bentley.  Colonel Fitts is played by Chris Cooper.  He does a wonderful job playing a homophobic marine.  And Mrs. Fitts is played by Emmy winning Allison Janney.  Even though she barely speaks in the movie...she gives a beautiful performance.  And then there is Jane's best friend...Angela.  Angela is a beautiful blonde young woman who wants to always be unordinary is beautiful.  She is also the image of Lester Burnham's infatuation.This movie had everything working for it.  From the marvelous actors, beautiful cinematography, and the original score by Thomas Newman. I also loved the symbolism of the red on white effect that you kept viewing during the movie. Even thought you don't agree with everything that Lester Burnham does on his quest to become happy and try to be kind of like a kid again...you have to admire him.  This movie takes you into the lives of a seemingly perfect suburban family.  My score...9 out of 10.  Definately worth seeing",Null,0,0,9 March 2001
Meet Joe Black," Way too long!
","Why was this movie so long?  I saw quite a few scenes that should have been cut from the movie.  Overall, this movie was extremely boring.  Did I mention that it was too long?  The only reason I saw it was because it had Brad Pitt and I had recently seen him in 'Sleepers'.  This movie was a waste of his and Sir Anthony Hopkin's time.  There were some cute scenes in here...e.g. the peanut butter.  And seeing Brad Pitt get hit by a car was kind of amusing.  But the rest of the movie was just plain boring.  Also, it's horrible to see Anthony's character treat that annoying little brat Susan or whatever the heck her name is better than the Allison.  What was so good about Susan?  If you like Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt you will probably like this movie.  Then again...you might not.",Null,1,2,28 March 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good, but doesn't live up to all of the hype
","Unfortunately, I can't say that I've read any of the books.  Although I've heard only good things about them.  I can, however, comment on what I saw today.  Harry Potter is not what all of the critics make it out to be.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either.First of all, I'm glad that Chris Columbus actually caste British actors with authentic accents.  Nothing drives me crazier than watching a 2 and Â½ hour movie hearing an American actor trying to sound British.  Another plus is getting an unknown actor to play Harry.  Daniel Radcliff's career has skyrocketed because of this one movie.Many reviewers have complained about Daniel Radcliffe's acting.  I thought he did a fairly good job.  He didn't seem to be under acting to me.  Maybe I am being naive because I have never read any of the books.  But it seems to me that people are looking at the movie compared to the book more than just the movie for what it was.I thought all of the actors did wonderful jobs.  I can really see Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint having flourishing acting careers.  They were flawless except for a couple of scenes at the end where Grint is overacting to the point of sheer annoyance.  Without a doubt, the best performance was Alan Rickman's.  He didn't get many speaking parts but when he did he was perfect.  And he made up for the talking he didn't do with his facial expressions.  Maggie Smith was also very good.One problem I had with the movie was the cheesy CGI effects that were scene in the battle with the troll, and just about all of the scenes involving flying on broomsticks.  The scenes didn't look real at all. It had me wondering why they even bothered, or why they didn't make the whole movie CGI.  The scene where all of the boats were floating into the school for the first time was very beautiful.  (But if they had we wouldn't have been able to see Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape now would we ?*sigh*)  The talking hat also gave me a headache.SPOILERS BELOWThe end of the movie was where it started to fall downhill.  For instance, why didn't they better secure the door where the stone was actually hidden? If a 10 year old girl can open the door what would make them think that a stronger and more experienced wizard would have a hard time.  The same is true with the vines after they get past the three headed dog.The chess scene should not have even been in the movie at all.  This is where Grint became a little too overdramatic for my liking.  A couple of questions popped into my mind while I was watching this: 1)	Why is there is a huge chess board on the way to the stone?  What smarty thought this thing up? 2)	Why did Grint have to mount a horse to play the game?  Couldn't he have stood on the side and yelled out commands? 3)	Why did Harry and Hermione have to be pieces?  Why weren't there enough pieces to play the game on their side?  And suppose there were only 2 people there instead of 3?Then in the ending when `he who shall not be named' goes through Harry's body and knocks him unconscious, why didn't he grab the stone?  Why would he go through all of that trouble, have the opportunity, and then fail to grab it and fly out of the room.  I heard that the ending was seriously altered to better accommodate the movie.  So that must have been one of the changes from the book.So all in all Harry Potter was pretty decent.  It had a couple of flaws but not enough to bring the movie down entirely.  The actors were great and the screen play wasn't the worst that it could have been.",Null,0,0,28 December 2001
The Iron Giant," Now THIS is a good cartoon!
","When I first heard about this movie the first thing that popped into my mind was `great, another cartoon'.  But it wasn't just another cartoon.  This is probably one of the best cartoons that I have ever seen.  It didn't get a lot of publicity and bombed at the box office.  I can understand what people were thinking though because I didn't want to see it either.  Just because Dreamworks or Disney didn't make the movie, no one wanted to see it.This is a cartoon that actually had morals and wasn't just about singing and entertainment.  It's more of a teen and adult movie than children's movie because children may have a hard time understanding some of the elements of the movie.The voice-overs were great.  Eli Marienthal isn't the best actor but he does a great job in this voice role.  Maybe he should stick to voicing roles because he is very good at them.  Jennifer Aniston is the last person whom you would expect to actually be able to put feeling into a voice-over but she does well too.  Christopher McDonald is perfect as the paranoid army soldier.  He always plays mean jerkish roles anyway so this is really not a change for him.  And Harry Connick Jr. did a pretty decent job, seeing as though he never has had much emotion to his voice.The animation is spectacular as well as the effects.  There is a great story and I wish there were more cartoons like this out there that could teach children lessons while entertaining them.  10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,6 May 2001
Mr. Holland's Opus," Avoid if you have the ability to hear, think, or breath...
","*May contain spoilers even though the movie is so cheesily predictable that they aren't really a suprrise*I can't see the big deal about this movie.  It didn't appeal too much to me. The acting was horrible with an exception of Dreyfuss, and the story was weak and cliched.  Yet most of the commentaries on this board loved it. They said it made them cry, and think.  This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.Mr. Holland who is supposed to be SUCH a wonderful composer, takes a job at some kind of school teaching a music appreciation class.  He is a horrible teacher.  How can you expect some kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be freaking Mozart after one day?  He's completely impatient and just plain mean.  For instancewhen they had their first test, he gave out the student's names and mocked what they put as answers.Oh and the scene where Holland is helping Miss. Lang how to play her clarinet.  The child has been playing the thing for 3 years and she can't get out a note.  He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.  I know that we wouldn't want him to sit there and analyze every single thing that she's doing wrongbut being a saxophone player, I know that that is completely impossible.  Plus it just added extra cheese to this soppy little movie.  Then later on we find out that Miss Lang has become a mayor and never even used her `talent'.  I also find it hard to believe that the whole class of 75 still has their instruments in perfect condition, let alone still knows how to play them.The whole scene with the deaf band playing instruments is ridiculous.  What is the point of the board with the flashing lights on it?  They could have kept that money in the budget to keep the arts open in that school.  What was the point of that board?  You don't have to be able to hear to play instruments.  Just blow and read your musicWhat really made me angry was the lack of any kind of ethnic characters in this movie.  There are two black people in this movie I believe.  On is the dumb, stereotypical football player who needs music because he is flunking all of his classes.  And the ridiculous thing about it is that this black football player has NO rhythm and has to get MR HOLLAND to help him.  What black teenage boy do you know doesn't have any rhythm and need an old white man to help them?  And then later on I guess there were too many black people in the movie, so they had to kill him off in Vietnam.  So then it was back down to all no black people.  Just the way that America likes it.The acting is below par.  The only people that did anywhere near a good job were Richard Dreyfuss and Jean Louisa Kelly.  Ms. Kelly had a beautiful voice, but that whole thing where she was in love with Dreyfuss was ridiculous.  Glenne Headly couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, and seeing her with Dreyfuss made her look even worse.  Seeing her in that scene where she had a tantrum when she couldn't understand Cole was more funny than emotional.  William H. Macy is generally a decent actor, but his character was so overly stereotypical and nasty that I just didn't care for him.  Olympia Dukakis is usually good, but in this movieshe wellwasn't. Alicia Witt did a good job with the young Gertrude Lang as well.  Joseph Anderson did a very good job as the 15 year old Cole.  Is he really deaf? He made it very believable.  The rest of the castdon't get me started on them",Null,3,9,15 April 2001
