"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Pretty Funny!!!
","I thought this was a very funny movie! Everybody did an awesome job! Simon Pegg gets better every time I see him. He plays Dennis Doyle who left his pregnant fianc√©e named Libby at the alter. 5 years later, they still see each other, so Dennis can see his son, but Libby is still upset. Dennis is a security guard at a women's store. Libby has been going out with a guy named Whit who is going to run in the Nike River Marathon in London, and to win Libby's respect, he decides to run too. His friend, Gordon, and his landlord, Mr. Ghoshdashtidar, decide to help him train. Whit proposes to Libby, but makes Dennis upset because he's still in love with her. Throughout the 26-mile race, Dennis pushes himself to finish, even when Whit injures him. If you love comedy, you'll love RUN FATBOY RUN!!!",8,0,2,16 August 2009
The Blair Witch Project," The Godfather of Found Footage Movies!!!
","When I was 9 years old, this movie was released. At the time, I didn't appreciate it because I didn't understand the concept of a found footage movie. 17 years later, I re-watched it to get ready for the new sequel and it has grown on me. It feels very real. I love the beautiful scenery and the autumn look of the woods. A woman named Heather is making a documentary on the Blair Witch. Her two friends, Josh and Mike help her with filming and the equipment. Pretty soon, they begin to hear strange noises at night, they get lost, and begin to see twig stick figures. This is definitely a good creepy iconic flick to watch when you wanna feel scared or great to watch around Halloween. I would definitely recommend THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!!",8,2,4,19 September 2016
The Avengers," The Ultimate Superhero Film!!!
","I waited a long time for this movie, and the pay-off was definitely worth it. Measly words like 'epic' or 'awesome' are not even close to describing this brilliant film. This movie is jam-packed with action, explosions, fight scenes, and comedy. There is never a dull moment, and time just flies by during this 142 minute extravaganza. The agency of SHIELD accidentally use the Tesseract to open a mysterious portal and unleashes Thor's evil brother, Loki. Loki brainwashes Dr. Selvig and Hawkeye to help him bring his army, the Chitauri to Earth. Nick Fury assembles Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow and the Incredible Hulk to help stop him. Thor joins the group later. (Thor is my absolute favorite Avenger and he had some decent action scenes and funny moments. I wish he had a little more screen time) Tony Stark and Steve Rogers often clash with each other, but they must all work together to defeat Loki and become....THE AVENGERS!!!!!",10,1,4,5 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Captain Jack is Back With a Vengeance!!!
","I'll admit that this installment is better than the previous two movies, but definitely not better than the original. Only Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Gibbs return for this adventure. Elizabeth, Will, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton, and Marty are gone, but it's still an interesting hilarious action-packed new chapter in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. Jack is still up to his old tricks and is asked by King George II to lead an expedition to find the Fountain of Youth. Jack must soon deal with his former lover, Angelica, who happens to be the daughter of the new villain, Blackbeard. They need the tear of a Mermaid and two silver chalices to make the fountain work. If you love the series, and especially Captain Jack Sparrow, you'll love PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES!!!",7,2,4,23 May 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An Extremely Hilarious Movie-Film!!!
","This movie is very funny, very crude, very racist, very sexist, and highly controversial, and I love every minute of it! Borat Sagdiyev leaves his nation of Kazakhstan and goes to America to film a documentary. He tries to drive a car, learns about feminism, sings the Kazakhstan national anthem at a rodeo full of rednecks, makes jokes about retarded people, tries to use proper manners during dinner and much more. When he sees Pamela Anderson on t.v. he travels to California to make her his wife. Another part I think is very funny is when Borat and his producer fight and run around naked in a hotel. I highly recommend BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF America FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN!!!",10,0,3,3 June 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!!!
","This version of the Hulk was so much better than the 2003 movie. It's a better adaptation and even has little easter eggs to the tv series. Long before he became an Avenger, Dr. Bruce Banner was a scientist working to bring back the 'Super Soldier' project (Captain America) but got hit with gamma radiation, now whenever he's angry, he turns into a big green Hulk.Five years later, Banner is hiding from the government in Brazil, only to be found by Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross, the father of his girlfriend, Betty. Ross gives one of his soldiers the serum and it turns him into an Abomination. They soon must use Hulk to fight the creature. If you love action, monsters and comic book movies, you'll love THE INCREDIBLE HULK!!!",8,7,10,30 April 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," A Great Suspense Driven Story With a Very Cheesy Sci-Fi Twist!!!
","First off, this movie is hardly a sequel or a prequel to 2008's Cloverfield. Maybe in some way, it's a spin-off. Only time will tell. 95% of the movie is its own thing. It's during the last ten minutes where it might come close to being related to the first movie. This review might contain some spoilers. I've heard that this film was originally known as The Cellar. At the last minute, the producers tweaked a few things to try and make it related to Cloverfield. The story itself was actually very good and very intriguing. When I saw the trailers, I didn't know what to expect. It's very driven by suspense, almost like that of a Hitchcock film. It's kind of a mix between Saw, Misery, and a film called Otis. John Goodman's character is scary at times. You never know when he's going to crack. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Live Free or Die Hard) stars as Michelle, a woman on the run from her broken relationship. During a car crash, she wakes up in Howard's underground bunker, chained to the wall. Howard tells her he saved her life and claims that the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from 'an attack.' (One thing I loved was that we never knew until the end if Howard was telling the truth, or making up crazy stories just to keep Michelle and another man, Emmett captive for himself.) Michelle tries to escape but soon learns that monsters come in many forms. I like that it was isolated and claustrophobic and mostly kept in one location as the three main stars bond, play games, listen to music and watch TV. In a weird way it reminded me of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead when the four friends were confined to the mall. At first, I was thrown off and let down by the twist in the last half, but my friend gave me his explanation and it make a little more sense. The film as a whole is definitely starting to grow on me. As I said, the movie is very driven by great suspense and some decent character development. It's like a great suspense classic from the 70's, but made for modern times with a decent science fiction twist. I would definitely recommend 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE!!!",9,1,5,12 March 2016
The Hangover," Very Funny!!!
","Tonight, I had a double feature at my theatre and saw this along with Land of the Lost. This movie is extremely funny and had a great storyline with great actors! That baby was adorable. Doug is going to be married in two days, so his friends Phil, Stu, and Alan take him to Vegas for his bachelor party. The next day, they wake up and can't remember anything about the night before, find a baby, and can't find Doug. They get into crazy misadventures trying to figure out what happened, arrested by the police, figure out who the baby belongs to, and try to find their friend before the wedding. I highly recommend THE HANGOVER!!!",10,4,7,9 June 2009
Iron Man 3," A Fresh New Take on the 'Iron Man' Franchise!!!
","I understand that this movie messed up The Mandarin character and a lot of comic book fans are mad, but I really enjoyed this new film. Shane Black gives us a dark and comedic new tale in the life of Tony Stark. I thought this new film was much better than Iron Man 2. I love that it takes place around the Christmas holiday. I love the references to 'The Avengers' After almost dying in The Avengers, Tony Stark has been having panic attacks and nightmares. When Happy Hogan is injured during a Mandarin terrorist attack, Tony takes it upon himself to bring The Mandarin to justice. When his house is destroyed, JARVIS sends Tony to rural Tennessee where a Mandarin bombing happened. I loved the comedic one-liners and the witty banter between Tony and a 10-year old boy named Harley. If you love the Iron Man series, you'll love IRON MAN 3!!!",7,1,7,6 May 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," What Your History Teacher Never Told You!!!
","This movie started off pretty slow, but got better toward the middle. It was a great blend of horror and political history. You can tell it's based on a graphic novel because of the often bright colors, slow-motion action fight scenes, and cgi gore, but it was still fun. When Abe Lincoln's mother is killed, he vows revenge against the man who did it. When he finds out the killer was a vampire, he's trained by Henry Sturgess to become a fearless vampire hunter. I like the last half of the movie better because Lincoln looks more like himself that we know with the beard. Will Lincoln be able to free the slaves, stop the war, and kill all the vampires during his Presidency? I'd definitely recommend ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER!!!",8,13,20,25 June 2012
Star Trek," An Awesome Remake!!!
","I am not a long time fan of the original series. In fact, I have never seen any of the original episodes, but I have seen the movies and knew the storyline. To me, this film is a complete restart/reboot/updated version of the classic series, and I loved it! Everybody did an awesome job kick-starting the Star Trek franchise! It has great action sequences, awesome special effects, comedy, sexual tension between Spock and Uhura, and much more! I agree with the commercial, 'This is not your father's Star Trek' We see the birth of James Kirk, building the new U.S.S. Enterprise, Leonard Nimoy returns as the older Spock. The crew meet at Starfleet Academy and train for three years. An evil time-traveling Romulan named Captain Nero alters the past to mess up the future. When Captain Pike is kidnapped by Nero, a new Captain must rise to stop the bad guy! If you are a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK!!!",10,3,15,12 May 2009
Fight Club," Highly Overrated!!!
","Last night was the very first time I have ever watched this movie. One of my Facebook friends bought me a copy because I had never seen it. I knew this movie had a cult following and after finally watching, I'm trying to understand why. Maybe if I watched it several more times, it'll grow on me, but I have a feeling I won't for quite a while. It wasn't all bad. It did have some decent and funny moments. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's character. The middle half of the movie was probably the best, but it went down-hill for me when the 'fight club' basically turned into a cult and the weird twist involving Brad Pitt's character. Edward Norton stars as a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. He's known as The Narrator because he visits support groups to see how other people suffer. He eventually meets a woman a lot more miserable than him named Marla Singer. After his apartment explodes, he calls up Tyler Durden, a man who he befriended on a plane. They slowly start a 'Fight Club' where guys meet up and just beat each other up. If you like movies that are supposed to be considered 'great' you might enjoy FIGHT CLUB!!!",4,6,15,10 June 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Very Boring!!!
","I tried hard to like this, but in the end, this movie was just as bad and boring as Tarantino's crap-fest, Death Proof! There were a few funny parts and a couple of action scenes, but the rest was just dull conversations in another language. You practically read the whole movie. There was 95% talking, and 5% action! The film is told in 5 chapters, and the only two chapters I kinda liked were Chapter Two & Five. Brad Pitt plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine who is the leader of a group called The Basterds. They kill Nazis, and plan to kill all the Nazis and Adolf Hitler at a theatre during a Nazi fest. A few weeks ago, I rented the original Inglorious Bastards movie to get ready for this one, but that was a waste of time, because this has nothing to do with the 1970's version. I definitely would not recommend INGLORIOUS BASTERDS!!!",5,46,99,25 August 2009
This Is the End," A Unique & Hilarious Film!!!
","This movie was exactly what I expected and more. Filling it with dirty jokes, weed, cameos, the apocalypse, religion, demonic possession, and much more. The idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and fresh. During a party at James Franco's house, the world begins to crumble. Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and James Franco all try to survive the apocalypse, and most importantly, try to survive from each other. From making a home-made sequel to 'The Pineapple Express' to getting high and listening to that ridiculous Gangnam Style song, this movie has a little bit of everything. I highly recommend THIS IS THE END!!!",10,18,35,14 June 2013
Iron Man 2," An Awesome Superhero Film!!!
","I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!",6,5,8,8 May 2010
Iron Man 2," Not as Good as the Original!!!
","Iron Man 2 is okay. It's pretty generic and weak to me. For one thing, Mickey Rourke makes a boring bland villain. When he talks, I wanna go to sleep. I only watch this when I marathon them all.This time around, Tony Stark loves the publicity of being Iron Man. Of course, the government wants him to turn over his suit to them but he refuses. Soon enough, Whiplash shows up with the same technology and tries to take Tony down. During the movie, Tony becomes an alcoholic and Nick Fury puts him on house arrest. Tony soon realizes that Whiplash is working for Justin Hammer, who tries to make his own versions of the Iron Man suit, but Whiplash makes them to start attacking and killing people. Tony and his friend, Rhodey put a stop to Whiplash and his drones. Again, this isn't my favorite, but you'll probably enjoy IRON MAN 2!!!",6,0,1,30 April 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Pretty Funny!!!
","I thought this was a very funny and raunchy movie! Everybody did an awesome job! Peter becomes depressed after his celebrity girlfriend, Sarah Marshall dumps him. Peter's friends tell him to forget her and take a vacation to Hawaii. After he gets there, he runs into Sarah and her new boyfriend. Peter becomes even more depressed, until he falls in love with the sexy beautiful receptionist named Rachel. Later, when Sarah's new boyfriend dumps her, she wants Peter back, but he's over her. Somehow, she manages to seduce him for a little bit, but he feels guilty about it, so he tells Rachel. After Peter goes back home, he works more on his musical Dracula puppet play. After the show, Rachel forgives him. you love romantic comedies, you'll love FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL!!!",6,1,4,16 August 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Nerd-gasm for all Trekkie Fans!!!
","This was a great sci-fi movie and a great Star Trek film in general. Lots of action, plenty of humor, surprises, emotion, and a brilliant twist to one of the classic Star Trek Films. One scene actually brought me to tears. After a mission has gone bad, Captain James Kirk is demoted to first officer of the Enterprise, with his predecessor, Admiral Christopher Pike reassuming command. When Starfleet Command is attacked by John Harrison, Kirk and his crew journey to a Klingon planet in search for Harrison. What follows is an all out war with Harrison, the Klingons, and a rogue Admiral. If you're a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS!!!",10,9,21,18 May 2013
Creed," A Beautifully Well Made Next Generation Spin-Off Sequel to the Rocky Franchise!!!
","Nine years ago, I thought 'Rocky Balboa' was the final film in the series, but it turns out there was a lot more story to tell. This spin- off and 7th film was very well directed, acted, and will definitely hit you in 'the feels' if you're a huge fan of the Rocky series. I man enough to admit that I was in tears the last 30 minutes of the movie. Rocky's character is pretty depressing in this film. Not only is Adrian dead, but Paulie has passed on, too. But first we must talk about Apollo Creed's extramarital son, Adonis (Donny)Donny Johnson has lived a tough life. He never knew his dad. He loves to fight, but doesn't want to be associated with the 'Creed' name. Michael B. Jordan will definitely make a name for himself with this movie. No one will train him, so he moves to Philadelphia in hopes of meeting Rocky Balboa, the man who fought his dad in the original two films. Rocky is very reluctant to train Donny because he's out of the game, and doesn't believe that Donny is really Apollo's son. Soon enough, Rocky gives in and decides to train him. Donny wants Rocky to keep it secret about who his dad is. Along the way, Donny meets a beautiful lounge singer named Bianca, who is slowly losing her hearing. When a British fighter named 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan hears about Donny being the son of the late Apollo Creed, he wants to fight him. The tears will begin to flow when we find out that Rocky is sick, and doesn't want treatment. Donny inspires him to fight on and live because Donny and Rocky have an immediate bond that's probably one of the most heartwarming in the whole series because Donny and Bianca give Rocky a new reason to try and keep living. There are major nods, throwbacks and flashbacks to the previous Rocky movies. The main fight is awesome, powerful and will definitely bring out some nostalgia during the final round. This movie is definitely an experience and a beautiful tribute to the Rocky series and will hopefully start something new. I highly recommend CREED!!!",10,8,16,26 November 2015
Orphan," Very Creepy!!!
","This movie had some pretty good scare scenes, and an awesome storyline about a couple named Kate and John Coleman who lose their 3 child. They have a son named Daniel and a deaf daughter named Max. They decide to adopt a little girl named Esther. (Isabelle Fuhrman did an awesome job as Esther! She was cute and scary at the same time) Esther begins to do bad things like pushing a girl who teased her in class off a slide, having temper tantrums, drives Kate crazy, threatening to slice off Daniel's manhood, and even killing someone! One of my favorites parts was when Esther dresses up beautifully, putting on makeup, and trying to seduce her new dad. What is wrong with Esther? I highly recommend that you adopt an ORPHAN!!!",8,2,5,28 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," An Awesome Film!!!
","I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!",6,5,10,26 May 2009
Yes Man," Pretty Good!!!
","I thought this was a really decent film! Jim Carrey is always hilarious. This time, he plays a man named Carl Allen who has been through a bad divorce and shuts himself off from the world. When a friend invites him to a 'Yes!' self-improvement seminar, Carl must say 'yes' to everything, including giving a ride and some money to a bum, letting his elderly landlady give him oral sex, learning a different language, playing guitar, and joins a Persian dating site. He soon meets Allison a woman who is in charge of a jogging club, and sings in a band. Carl slowly begins to fall in love with her. I highly recommend YES MAN!!!",8,0,0,8 July 2009
The Last Song," Hannah Montana in a Soap Opera!!!
","Today, I saw a friend who told me that she heard this movie was really bad, so that automatically meant that I had to see it and make fun of it. It's just another stereotypical teenage drama movie. Everybody is so melodramatic, that it's actually funny. This movie goes all over the place; one minute, Miley Cyrus loves her new boyfriend, and the next, she's mad at him, and then goes back to loving him...it's crazy! Cyrus plays Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, who is rebellious and forced to spend time with her dad and brother. (This is kinda important; she used to play the piano, but ever since her parents split up, she stopped playing) During her time with daddy, she finds sea turtle eggs, and decides to help save them from raccoons. The last thirty minutes is when you will need your tissues. If you keep a very open mind, you might like THE LAST SONG!!!",5,7,12,6 April 2010
Cloverfield," Pretty Good!!!
","This movie makes you feel like you are there when everything is happening. It makes it seem more realistic. It was a great storyline, but by the end of the movie, my eyes were hurting, and I had a headache, because of the camera shaking. Maybe it was because I was dumb enough to sit too close to the screen. Here's some advice: sit far back away from the screen. The monster was very creepy. There was a scene where the main characters are in a helicopter, and you see the monster being attacked and falling down, then there's huge smoke where you can't see it. Everyone thinks it's dead, then all of the sudden, the monster jumps up and attacks the helicopter, and it feels like it coming right at you. If you love thrillers, you'll love CLOVERFIELD!!!",7,0,2,16 August 2009
The Hateful Eight," A Crazy Snowy Bloody Western That's Destined to Become a Tarantino Cult Classic!!!
","I'm not the biggest Tarantino fan in the world, but I thought this new movie was actually really good. The gore was crazy and over the top, which I love. It had great suspense, like trying to figure out which of the men was trying to kill the other. It had beautiful scenery. It did feel a little isolated and claustrophobic because the film mostly takes place in the boarded up Haberdashery. The movie is perhaps even more racist than Django Unchained, but the director is just showing us what it was like back in the 1800's. Kurt Russell plays John Ruth aka 'The Hangman' John is a bounty hunter who's taking Daisy Domergue to Red Rock to collect $10,000 and let her hang. Along the way, they meet Major Marquis Warren and Sheriff Chris Mannix who need a ride before the blizzard hits. When they make it to the Haberdashery they meet Bob the handyman, Oswaldo Mobray, Joe Gage, and General Sandy Smithers. John doesn't trust any of them, and forces them to give up their weapons. Throughout the night, we begin talking to each other, but still weary and unaware that some of them won't survive until morning. There are plenty of twists and turns. A good murder mystery, a crazy funny backstory involving Marquis Warren, and amazing over the top gore. If you love westerns, suspense and violence, you'll love THE HATEFUL EIGHT!!!",10,6,27,30 December 2015
The Expendables," The Perfect Action Film!!!
","This was without a doubt one of the best action movies of the year! There was plenty of shooting, killing, fighting, and explosions to satisfy any action fan. Sylvester Stallone and the gang are back with a bloody vengeance. Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road, and Hale Caesar are a group of elite mercenaries known as the Expendables. Barney is soon asked by the mysterious 'Mr. Church' to take his team on a mission to Vilena to overthrow a brutal dictator named General Garza. Barney and his crew team up with Garza's daughter and also tries to take down James Monroe, who controls the actions of Garza, in exchange for Garza's wealth and fear from his own people. I highly recommend THE EXPENDABLES!!!",10,2,9,17 August 2010
Megamind," Awesome Family Fun!!!
","This movie is perfect for the whole family. It's hilarious and has a heart-warming storyline. Will Ferrell was awesome as Megamind, the villain and Metro Man's archenemy. On the day Metro Man is being honored by the city, Megamind breaks out of jail with the help of a talking fish named Minion and kidnaps Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind finally defeats Metro Man and takes over the city. Over time, Megamind grows bored and wants an enemy to fight. He creates a serum of Metro Man's DNA in order to create a superhero, but along the way, he disguises himself as a museum curator named Bernard and starts to fall in love with Roxanne. After he accidentally turns Roxanne's cameraman, Hal into a hero, he uses his power for evil. Megamind must stop him, save the girl, and become the hero himself. I highly recommend MEGAMIND!!!",10,8,13,10 November 2010
Blades of Glory," An Awesome Film!!!
","Will Ferrell and Jon Heder are awesome together! This is an extremely funny movie! Jimmy MacElroy and Chazz Michael Michaels are skaters who tie for the gold. When they soon fight in front of everyone watching, they are banned for life from men's singles competition. Three years pass, and Jimmy's gay stalker finds a loophole; he can skate in couple's skating. Jimmy's old coach has an idea for Jimmy and Chazz to work together and become the first males couple's skating. Jimmy and Chazz finally work together and become friends to beat the brother-sister team of Stranz and Fairchild van Waldenberg. Jimmy falls in love with their sister Katie. Stranz and Fairchild try to stop Jimmy and Chazz from winning the gold. If you love comedy, and Will Ferrell, and John Heder, you'll love BLADES OF GLORY!!!",10,0,1,16 August 2009
Taxi Driver," A Genuine Bona-Fide Cult Classic, and Rightfully So!!!
","Wow, I can't believe it took me this long to getting around to watching this movie. I was on vacation earlier this week, saw it On Demand and finally decided to give it a try. I thought I had an idea of what the movie would be like, but I was off, and that's a good thing. This had a great story, great acting, great script, great directing, and great suspense. I absolutely love the raw classic look of the 1970's. Robert DeNiro stars as Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine. He's depressed and lonely and drives a taxi to make money. He soon becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Their relationship is quite awkward. He also becomes interested in helping a teen prostitute named Iris (played by a young Jodie Foster) get out of the hooker life. Travis becomes a vigilante by buying up guns and tries to help clean New York of corruption and overbearing pimps. I will consider buying the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray of this film. I highly recommend TAXI DRIVER!!!",10,2,3,9 November 2016
Ant-Man," A Cheesy Good Blast That's Reminiscent of the Old School Comic Book Movies!!!
","Ant-Man is cheesy good fun in the best way possible. It almost feels like an old school 1980's comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (Like most DC comic movies nowadays) and has the right amount of comedy with crazy action. There are plenty of references to the other MCU films and even some surprise cameos. I would say this movie is equal to 'Guardians of the Galaxy' I loved the concept of a cat burglar wanting a chance of redemption by doing what's right and trying patch things up with his family. Paul Rudd seems like the best choice for Scott Lang. He doesn't seem like he'd be the superhero type because of his past, but by the end of the film, he proves that he's worthy to don the Ant-Man suit. This review WILL contain spoilers.After being released from prison, Scott Lang swears off crime for good because he wants to do right by his daughter, but he can't hold a job because of his edgy past, so he's forced to pull off one more job by breaking into a house and finds the Ant-Man suit. Little does he know, the house he broke into was set up by Hank Pym, the scientist who created the technology of the Ant-Man suit. Hank thinks Scott is the perfect man for the job. He's to use the suit to break into a top secret building and steal the deadly Yellowjacket suit, which if used in the wrong way could cause major wars and destruction.With the powers of the Ant-Man suit, Scott is able to shrink down to the size of an ant. He can control ants and other insects with his mind and help aid him in his mission. In conclusion, I thought this was a very decent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Filled with good action, good comedy, good storyline, and cool references. If you love comic book and superhero movies, I highly recommend ANT-MAN!!!",10,2,8,19 July 2015
21 Jump Street," One of the Best Movies of the Year!!!
","I still haven't watched the original series, but I absolutely loved this movie. This movie is more of a continuation of the series, and reboots the franchise. It was hilarious from beginning to end. I cannot stress enough how epicly awesome this movie is. It's filled with dirty jokes, car- chases, gun-play and action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play Schmidt and Jenko. Schmidt was a nerd in high school, and Jenko was a dim-witted jock. Seven years later, they meet up again at the police academy. They become partners and assigned to park patrol. When they screw up, they are reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street. They must go undercover as high school students and stop a new synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier. They get stuck in tons of hilarious situations. If you want the perfect buddy-cop comedy action film, you'll definitely love 21 JUMP STREET!!!",10,0,6,20 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," The First Avenger Wasn't That Great!!!
","This movie didn't meet my expectations. It didn't have enough action and started out pretty slow. The action scenes they did show were awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.) Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the 'Super-Soldier' experiment. He soon becomes tall and muscular and becomes a national treasure as 'Captain America' with an awesome motorcycle and bulletproof American flag shield. He must stop Red Skull from destroying the world with a cubed jewel. If you enjoy Marvel Comic movies, you might enjoy CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER!!!",7,11,27,26 July 2011
American Hustle," Never Hustle a Hustler!!!
","I really enjoyed the premise of this movie; two con artists are forced to work with the FBI to take down a corrupt Mayor. It takes place in the late 70's. This movie seemed to capture the 1970's pretty well. It had a great look and the women (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence) were beautiful. In my opinion, this movie should've won Best Picture.Christian Bale stars as a balding con-artist named Irving Rosenfeld who meets and falls in love with Sydney Prosser, posing as English aristocrat 'Lady Edith Greensly' Sydney helps Irving with his scams. When they are caught and captured by FBI agent Richie DiMaso, they are given a choice; either go to jail or help him with 4 additional arrests. They soon get mixed up with the Mafia and many schemes where Irving is forced to involve his wife. I would definitely consider watching this movie again someday. I highly recommend American HUSTLE!!!",10,1,4,9 June 2014
Fargo," An Amazingly Awkward Film!!!
","I just watched this for the 1st time, and it was surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it. I know it's supposed to be a thriller/drama, because it had some brutal scenes, but I couldn't help but laugh at a few scenes because of their accents and overuse of the line 'oh yeah' There were some pretty random scenes, but that's what makes it a good movie. I loved Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Olmstead. She was my favorite character. Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud was very creepy. Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota and hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, due to financial problems. When things go wrong, people turn up dead, and pregnant Chief Marge Olmstead is on the case. I would definitely recommend FARGO!!!",9,1,2,3 November 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Part 1 in the Epic Trilogy!!!
","In a dark place called Mordor, an evil guy named Sauron made the ultimate Ring, and in battle, it was cut off. Hundreds of years later, a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins found it. 60 years after that, his nephew, Frodo must destroy it, because Sauron wants it back. Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Giml, and Boromir set out to Mordor to take it back to the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it once and for all! And it takes 3 movies to do that! I love the beautiful scenery, and the dark depressing look and feel it sometimes has. If you love fantasies and epics, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING!!!",8,0,0,16 August 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The 1st Part to the Epic Conclusion!!!
","Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!",6,1,2,23 November 2010
Salt," Not What I Expected!!!
","For some reason, I didn't like this movie as well as I thought I would. The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it. If you like action movies, you might like SALT!!!",5,1,5,27 July 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rooney Mara Saved the Movie For Me!!!
","I don't why I wanted to see this. I've never read the book or seen the original Swedish movie. I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!",4,4,10,4 January 2012
Shrek Forever After," The Story Comes to a Magical End!!!
","I saw this with a friend earlier, and it was a lot better than we expected. Shrek isn't feeling too happy with his life with everyone, and wants everything quiet, the way it used to be. Shrek meets up with Rumpelstiltskin, who makes him a deal; if Shrek gives him a day from his past, Rumpel will give Shrek a day where he will be feared again. Unfortunately, Rumpel takes the day that Shrek was born. Fiona, Donkey, Puss in Boots and the rest of the gang don't even know him. Shrek only has 24 hours to figure out how to return his life to normal, and get Fiona to fall in love with him again. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend SHREK FOREVER AFTER!!!",8,0,4,25 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Hogwarts: Year Three!!!
","HP3 was the last of my favorites. After this, the Harry Potter series kinda went downhill for. This one is darker and different than the previous two movies. An escaped convict named Sirius Black breaks out of Azkaban and tries to find Harry. Black is believed to be a supporter of Voldemort. During his 3rd year at Hogwarts, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin teaches him the Patronus charm to defend him against the Demeontors; the guards of Azkaban searching for Black. With the help of Ron, Hermione, and time-travel; Harry will come face-to-face with the man who betrayed his parents. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!!!",7,0,1,20 July 2011
Captain America: Civil War," Everything 'Batman V Superman' Should Have Been!!!
","I love both Marvel and DC movie companies. I'm not one of those people that say 'this is better because of that' I like mostly all superhero flicks. When Batman V Superman came out, I was half disappointed with it. It was overly dark, dreary, random Lex Luthor side stories and weird dream sequences. The battle between Batman and Superman didn't last too long. In comes Captain America: Civil War.Civil War was the definitely the best Captain America movie in the trilogy. I remember being bored with Captain America: The First Avenger. The action scenes are great and the battle between the heroes is epic. There are so many surprises, that I don't wanna spoil them for you, but trust me when I say all the fight scenes are amazing! A year after the fight in Sokovia and dealing with Ultron, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff are on their own mission trying to stop a man from stealing a biological weapon. Things get disastrous and everyone blames them. The Avengers are forced to sign a Bill called the 'Sokovia Accords' stating that from now on, the Government will control all the Avengers' actions. Tony Stark agrees with it, and Steve Rogers doesn't. Pretty soon, they are all divided and begin to fight each other (mostly over the Winter Soldier) Like I said, this is what Batman V Superman should have been, but it wasn't. Civil War was a more enjoyable experience. If you love epic action and superhero movies, you'll love CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR!!!",10,9,20,10 May 2016
American History X," A Great, Powerful and Brutal Film!!!
","I finally watched this recently and was quite surprised by good it was. The movie deals with the touchy subject of racism and ends with redemption and sadness. Edward Norton was intense and brutal as the skinhead Derek Vinyard. His brother, Danny idolizes him and wants to follow in his footsteps by being a white supremacist. There was one scene in particular where Derek tries to make a point by almost attacking his family at the dinner table I thought was very claustrophobic and tense. The majority of the movie takes place in a series of black-and-white flashbacks that shows Derek's reign and killing two black teens for stealing his car. Three years later, Danny is excited for his brother to get out of jail, but finds that he's reformed and ashamed of his past. Derek tries to help Danny change his ways before it's too late. I can't believe it has taken me this long to see this film. The ending is pretty tragic, but I would go so far as to call it a masterpiece. I would highly recommend American HISTORY X!!!",10,1,3,2 October 2015
Saw III," The Epic Saw Film!!!
","To me, Saw III is more epic because it's longer and has more soap opera elements to Amanda and Jigsaw's character. Tobin Bell does another awesome job as Jigsaw, who is now on his death bed. Jigsaw has Lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if Jeff makes it through his test. Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines. I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain. Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out! If you love Jigsaw and the Saw movies, you'll love SAW III!!!",10,0,2,16 August 2009
The Conjuring 2," Very Creepy and Just as Good as the Original Conjuring!!!
","A lot of people have said this sequel is better and scarier than the original. Personally, I think it's just as equally creepy. I think James Wan is a great horror director. He knows how to get the job done and actually scare me. (Dead Silence actually scared me when I saw it at the theater) The Conjuring movies are period films and take place in the 1970's. I love that it naturally looks like the 70's and not fake like Tim Burton's Dark Shadows. This film features the Amityville Horror house in the beginning, then the majority of it is about the Enfield Poltergeist in London, England. In 1977, the Hodgson family begin to experience demonic and supernatural occurrences in their house, mostly at night time. The spirit haunting them seems to be Bill Wilkins, the previous owner who died in the living room. The youngest daughter, Janet becomes possessed and keeps telling the family to get out. Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to the scene to observe and report only. Will they find that the house is truly haunted, or is it actually all a hoax? If you love ghosts, and demonic possession, I highly recommend THE CONJURING 2!!!",8,1,3,13 June 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," One Crazy Film!!!
","This movie is very unique, and quite different than others. It's like a video game world and a comic book world mixed together on live-action film. A lot of the times, it didn't make too much sense, but you just go along for the ride. It's very colorful, and like a crazy acid trip. I'm sure if you grew up in the 80's, you'll absolutely love this film. A bass guitarist for the band 'Sex Bob-omb' named Scott Pilgrim begins to slowly fall in love with a woman named Ramona Flowers. Scott soon learns that he must defeat Ramona's 7 evil exes in order for them to have a relationship together. I'd recommend SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD!!!",6,3,11,17 August 2010
Twilight," If I Was Your Glampire!!!
","For the past two years, I have avoided this movie like the plague. It just looked ridiculous, and melodramatic because of sparkly vampires. There was a double feature tonight, and I finally decided to cave in. It wasn't as bad as I wanted it to be, but I'll still make fun of it. In case you don't know the story, I'll give you a quick version; Bella Swan is forced to move to Forks, Washington where it's always cloudy and raining. She soon meets Edward Cullen, who just happens to be a vampire...that sparkles. When Edward saves her from almost being hit by a van, she slowly begins to fall suicidally in love with him. If you love melodramatic love stories about vampires, you'll love TWILIGHT!!!",6,0,2,30 June 2010
Bridesmaids," I Love Kristen Wiig!!!
","Kristen Wiig is the only reason I wanted to see this movie, and she is insanely hilarious! (She'll go down in history with Lucille Ball and Gilda Radner) Of course, it had more great actresses such as Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, and Wendi McLendon-Covey. There were a lot of hilarious and disgustingly awesome jokes. Wiig plays Annie, best friend to Lillian who is about to get married. Annie is asked to be the Maid of Honor and becomes jealous of Lillian's new rich friend, Helen. Throughout the movie, Annie slowly goes crazy and constantly competes against Helen. If you want a good decent comedy, you'll love BRIDESMAIDS!!!",8,18,34,17 May 2011
Django Unchained," An Awesome Blaxploitation/ Spaghetti Western!!!
","I am not what you'd call a 'Quentin Tarantino fan' In fact, I hated Death Proof, and Inglorious Basterds. Some friends and I saw this tonight, and I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoyed. It was very entertaining. Filled with action, comedy, gore, history, suspense, and interesting characters. It had beautiful scenery and great sets. Jamie Foxx stars as Django, a slave who is recently saved and freed by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. Schultz needs Django's help to hunt down the Brittle brothers. In exchange, Schultz will help Django find Calvin Candie, the man who bought his wife, Broomhilda. This was probably the coolest western movie I've seen in years. It had a great revenge story. If you are offended by slavery and the 'n' word, you might not like it, but I would definitely recommend DJANGO UNCHAINED!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!",10,1,7,1 January 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part 2 in the Epic Trilogy!!!
","It's been a couple of days since the Fellowship broke up into 3 groups. Merry and Pippin have been taken by Ors and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to help find them. Frodo and Sam continue their journey closer to Mordor. You are introduced to new characters, like Grima Wormtongue, Eomer, Eowyn, King Theoden, Gollum, Treebeard, and a lot more. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find that Gandalf is still alive. Frodo and Sam seek help from Gollum on getting to Mordor. Saruman sends his Orcs to Rohan, so the people flee to Helm's Deep where a huge battle takes place. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken by Boromir's brother; Faramir who wants to take the ring to Gondor. If you love battles, fantasies, and epics, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS!!!",8,0,1,16 August 2009
22 Jump Street," A Great Sequel That's Bigger (and quite possibly) Better Than the Original!!!
","Half the time, I'm the kind of person that thinks the original is always the best, but on very rare occasions, the sequel can surpass its predecessor. This review may contain spoilers! 22 Jump Street had bigger action and some better jokes than '21' It's a sequel that's self-aware that it's spoofing the sequel genre and talk about 're-hashing the same old stuff' It distances itself from the television series, almost like the original and brings a fresh take to the buddy cop genre. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return as Schmidt and Jenko. 21 Jump Street has been bought back by the Koreans, so they move across the street to 22 Jump Street. This time, the duo go undercover as college students to track down the supplier of a drug called 'WHYPHY' (WiFi) that killed a student on campus. Schmidt meets up with a girl named Maya (forget about Molly from the previous movie) while Jenko hangs out with a cool football jock named Zook, who might be involved with the drug. There are some great cameos and the ending credits are AMAZING! (Be sure to stay and watch all thru the credits) I loved this sequel, it has tons of laughs, and great exploding action! I highly recommend 22 JUMP STREET!!!",10,7,15,15 June 2014
Kick-Ass," Better Than I Expected!!!
","I saw this a few hours ago with some friends, and we all thought it was hilarious and incredibly bloody. I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. A dorky teen named Dave Lizewski begins wondering why people haven't decided to be real-life superheroes. When he buys a costume on the internet, he goes around and tries to help people and says that his name is 'Kick-Ass' He inspires Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to stop a drug dealer named Frank D'Amico. They soon decide to work with Kick-Ass because they are all on the same team. Will Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit-Girl be able to take down the powerful drug lord? I highly recommend KICK-ASS!!!",6,3,12,21 April 2010
Gran Torino," An Awesome Film!!!
","This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be! It had a great storyline, good message, some funny moments, and some heart-breaking moments. Clint Eastwood was awesome as Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran who is very cranky, grumpy, and racist. He lives in a neighborhood dominated by poor Asian immigrants and infested with gangs. A young Hmong boy named Thao Lor who agrees to an initiation which requires him to steal Walt's prized car, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino, but Walt stops him. Walt finally befriends Thao's family, and tries to help Thao become a man, and learn responsibility. When a Hmong gang threatens the Lor family, Walt knows what he must do. I highly recommend GRAN TORINO!!!",10,0,7,13 August 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A Great Action-Filled Comic Book Film!!!
","To me, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was quite better than the original. It had great action, fantastic visuals and special effects, decent humor and good character development. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy felt like a soap opera, whereas this has the right amount of drama that it feels even with the storyline. Not long after fighting The Lizard, it's time for Peter Parker and his fellow classmates to graduate. Peter still feels guilty about the death of Gwen's father.Meanwhile, a nerdy maintenance man who works at OsCorp named Max Dillon falls into a tank of genetically modified electric eels and becomes able to control anything that runs on electricity. (Jamie Foxx made an 'electrifying' villain. He starts out really dorky and becomes awesomely tough by the end of the film) Max idolizes Spider-Man, but when Max is labeled as a villain due to his appearance, the people of New York hate him and want Spider-Man to destroy him. Spider-Man must not only deal with Electro and a new Green Goblin, but must face the idea that he may never see Gwen again as she wants to go to school in England. This is the first summer blockbuster of 2014 in my opinion. I highly recommend THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2!!!",9,3,8,7 May 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Sparkly Vampires Vs. Masculine Werewolves!!!
","For the past two years, I've avoided the Twilight saga like the plague because it just looked so melodramatic and ruined the image of scary vampires like Dracula. Instead, we get a Glampire, buff Werewolves, and a whiny teen named Bella who is suicidal over them. There was a double feature at my theater tonight, so I finally decided to cave in and watch. Bella is just ridiculous. After she gets a paper cut at her birthday party, Jasper Cullen tries to attack her. The Cullens soon decide to leave Forks, and Bella goes into a deep depression. Whenever she gets an adrenaline fix, she can see glimpses of Edward. If you love glampires and melodramatic love stories, I'm sure you'll love NEW MOON!!!",6,6,7,30 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An Interesting and Different Story in the Star Wars Saga!!!
","I honestly didn't think this was as bad as a lot of the Star Wars nerds are making it out to be. I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan in the world, but I like them. I was entertained, that's all I care about. If the story is interesting, and it has cool battle scenes, then I'll enjoy it. Some of my complaints were that Luke Skywalker's big return was kinda 'meh' He's just cranky and annoyed by Rey for the first half of the movie. There was hardly a lightsaber battle. Another thing was that they killed off someone that hardly had any character development. There were a lot of fan theories about this person, I figured they'd be around for Episode IX, but nope, they're dead and gone. I loved the look of Supreme Leader Snoke's dark red room. It was a beautiful set. A lot of people are complaining about the scenes on Canto Bight, regarding the casino. I honestly thought it was interesting and refreshing. It shows that there's a big world in the Star Wars universe that we probably haven't even seen yet. The movie picks up almost immediately after 'The Force Awakens' The First Order shows up and attacks the resistance. Meanwhile, Rey tries to get Luke to come out of hiding to help fight against Kylo Ren. To me, this is probably one of the cheesiest in the series, but I like 'cheesy' that's why I enjoyed it. If you love the Star Wars series, then you'll probably like STAR WARS EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI!!!",10,4,18,20 December 2017
Evil Dead," A Gory Bloody Homage to the Original!!!
","I thought this was a pretty decent remake/sorta kinda sequel to the original classic. I didn't love it, but I don't hate it. The gore and special effects were great! The setting and atmosphere were very creepy, but it's not 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' A group of friends are meeting up at a cabin to help Mia quit her drug problem, cold turkey. When Eric reads from the Necronomicon (in this film, it's called Naturom Demonto) all hell breaks loose, unleashing demons to possess the souls of the group. There were a few scenes that made me cringe. If you want a bloody gory creepy good time, you'll love EVIL DEAD!!!",7,6,20,10 April 2013
Saw II," The Games Continue!!!
","This was a really awesome sequel, and just as thrilling as the original! I like the S.W.A.T team scenes and the traps and twists! After bailing his son out of jail, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is all part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is. If you love horror, Saw, and twists, you'll love SAW II!!!",10,0,1,24 October 2009
Clash of the Titans," An Awesome Remake!!!
","I thought this was a very decent remake and great tribute to the 1981 classic. I loved the special effects, the action, and the suspense. Some things are different than the original, but it still has the same basic storyline. The human son of Zeus, Perseus loses his family because of Hades. When Hades threatens the city of Argos by releasing the Kraken, Perseus and his team decides to seek the Stygian Witches in hopes of figuring out a way to kill the Kraken. Along the way, they must deal with giant scorpions, befriend a race of Djinn, and try kill Medusa. If you love epics and Greek mythology, you will love CLASH OF THE TITANS!!!",8,1,2,6 April 2010
Jurassic World," A Great Worthy Nostalgic Sequel That Lives up to the Original!!!
","This sequel was definitely worth the fourteen year wait. It has finally gone back to the basics of the original and stands as a true sequel to the original 1993 Jurassic Park. It's very action-packed, suspenseful, has the right amount of comedy and some great nostalgia for fans of the original. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jake Johnson made great new characters. I became very invested in the characters, and even some of the Dinosaurs. Throughout the majority of the movie, I kept thinking they were missing a great opportunity, and when they hinted at it and it finally happened, I was almost in tears because my wish came true, but I won't dare ruin it for you. Let's just say the final battle is incredibly epic!22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, it has been renamed to Jurassic World and is finally a fully functioning theme park with Dinosaurs, which was John Hammond's vision. The visitor rates are declining, so they make a new genetically modified dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Indominus is probably the meanest toughest smartest Dinosaur throughout the entire Jurassic Park series. Owen Grady (Pratt) tries to hunt it down after it escapes her enclosure. Helping Owen and trying to find her nephews through the havoc is Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager. If you love the series, I highly recommend JURASSIC WORLD!!!",10,48,107,13 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," An Epic Sequel Just as Awesome as the Original!!!
","The Wolfpack is back with a vengeance! The Hangover Part II may be better than the original. It has more action, more Chow, and more hilarious Alan moments. It re-creates a few scenes from the original such as the opening, and the ending with the pictures of their wild night. It's been two years since that weekend in Vegas, and it's time for Stu's Wedding. The Wedding is in Thailand, and the gang is forced to bring Alan along. After having a beer with Teddy (the younger brother of Stu's fianc√©e,) they wake up in Bangkok with no memory of the previous night. Alan has a shaved head, and Stu has Mike Tyson's tattoo. Throughout the day, they must deal with Monks, a stripping transsexual, getting shot, and teaming up with Mr. Chow in order to find Teddy before the Wedding. If you love the original, you'll love THE HANGOVER PART II!!!",8,6,17,26 May 2011
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Transsexuals Love to Rock!!!
","I thought this was a pretty good movie! Everybody did an awesome job, especially John Cameron Mitchell who plays Hedwig. Hedwig had an awesome singing voice and looked extremely sexy dressed as a girl. My favorite song is 'Angry Inch' Throughout the film, Hedwig tells us his/her life story starting from East Berlin, to getting a sex change so he/she can get married and go to America, loving a teenager named Tommy Speck / Tommy Gnosis, who steals Hedwig's songs and performs them as his own. Hedwig follows Tommy around to give him a lawsuit. If you love rock musicals, and transsexuals, you'll love HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH!!!",6,0,0,2 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Hogwarts: Year Five!!!
","This movie is definitely better than the last. It has a better and more interesting storyline. It introduces new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix LeStrange (two very interesting female characters) The Ministry of Magic is in denial that Voldemort is back, and turns against Harry and Dumbledore. They appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher; a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic. She eventually takes control of the school, which causes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to start a rebellion against her and teach their friends how to defend themselves against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry and Voldemort will come face-to-face again when he is looking for a prophecy to kill Harry. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX!!!",Null,0,1,20 July 2011
Toy Story," Another Childhood Favorite!!!
","I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!",10,0,0,17 June 2010
Avatar," An Awesome Epic!!!
","This movie is a true Epic! It is visually beautiful, has awesome special effects, and intense battle sequences. In the year 2154, a corporation is mining Pandora for unobtanium. A small group of marines and soldiers are brought in as mercenaries. Jake Sully is a paralyzed marine who volunteers for the Avatar Program. An Avatar is a body that is a mix of human and Na'vi DNA. The Na'vi are the blue species that inhabit Pandora. Jake offers to earn their trust as an Avatar so the military can get closer to what they need. When Jake meets Neytiri and learn their ways of survival, he soon wants to help them and stop the humans from destroying Pandora. I highly recommend AVATAR!!!",8,3,8,22 December 2009
Toy Story 2," Another Childhood Favorite!!!
","I was 9 years old when this was released, and I loved it and the original ever since I was a kid. This sequel is just as good as the first. After Andy accidentally tears Woody's arm, Woody is forced to stay at home while Andy goes to Cowboy Camp. During a yard sale, Woody tries to save a fellow toy, and is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector named Al. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, and Rex go to Al's Toy Barn to try and save him. Woody meets up with Jessie, Stinky Pete, and Bullseye who tell him just how famous he is. Buzz and the gang must hurry before Al ships Woody's Roundup to Japan. I highly recommend TOY STORY 2!!!",10,0,1,17 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," An Awesome Horror Film!!!
","Today, I had a quadruple feature at my theatre. I saw this along with Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, Up, and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Drag Me To Hell actually scared me! The last time I was really scared at the theatre was during Dead Silence. I literally had chills during the loud scary parts. Christine Brown works as a loan officer, and soon must deal with an elderly Gypsy woman named Mrs. Sylvia Ganush. When she is denied a third extension on her mortgage, she places a terrible curse on Christine. She begins hearing voices, sees the shadows of demons and a lot worse things. Within three days, Christine will be dragged to Hell, unless she can do something about it. I highly recommend that you DRAG ME TO HELL!!!",10,4,8,2 June 2009
Saw," The Golden Age of Saw!!!
","This is where the games began, and started an entire franchise of Saw films. Before there was Hoffman, Strahm, Jill, and Erickson, it was just Jigsaw testing Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon in an old dirty and filthy bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They hear a tape by Jigsaw that tells Dr. Gordon to kill Adam by 6:00 a.m., or his wife and daughter will die. Zep has his family hostage and Detecive David Tapp still thinks that Dr. Gordon is linked to the Jigsaw murders. Throughout the time in the room, we see flashbacks of Jigsaw's other games, and why Adam and Gordon are in the room. If you love horror, and twists, you'll love SAW!!!",10,1,3,24 October 2009
Up," Awesome Family Fun!!!
","Today, I had a quadruple feature at my theatre. I saw this along with Drag Me To Hell, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. I thought this was a really good and very funny film! Carl, Russell, and Dug are the perfect team of comedy! When Carl is a young boy, he meets a new friend named Ellie and find that they both love adventure. They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his 'Assisting the Elderly' badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!",10,1,3,2 June 2009
Titanic," A Truly Epic Film!!!
","It's been a long time since I've watched this movie from beginning to end, so I decided to refresh my memory. I forgot how great and sad this film is. It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline. In 1996, Brock Lovett and his team explore the Titanic wreckage in search for a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fianc√© Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink. Every passing minute, Jack and Rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all. If you're a history buff and want a smart love story, you'll love TITANIC!!!",10,2,3,10 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Hogwarts: Year Four!!!
","To me, HP4 is the weakest in the series. It's kinda boring and doesn't have too much of a plot. This year, Hogwarts host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. When the three are picked, a fourth name comes out of the goblet; Harry Potter. Each task is very dangerous. After the first task, there is a Yule Ball and shows that Hermione is beginning to fall for Ron. During the last task, Harry will come face-to-face with Voldemort reborn. If you love the series, I'm sure you'll love HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE!!!",6,0,0,20 July 2011
Thor," One of the Best Marvel Comic Movies Ever!!!
","I've seen this awesome movie twice so far, and it keeps getting better!Thor took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorite Marvel Comic movies! There is never a dull moment, and is filled with action, comedy, suspense and Norse Mythology. The city of Asgard is beautiful. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for the role as Thor! Thor is about to become King of Asgard, until Frost Giants ruin the ceremony. When Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront the leader, Odin takes away Thor's powers and sends him to Earth, where he comes across a beautiful scientist named Jane Foster. 50 miles away from the town is Thor's mighty hammer, Mjolnir, which no one can pick up. Until Thor becomes worthy, he won't be able to pick up his hammer.Back on Asgard, Loki becomes the new King, and sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor. Will Thor be able to save the town without his powers? If you want an awesomely epic superhero movie, you'll love THOR!!!",10,7,14,10 May 2011
Thor," One of my Absolute Favorites!!!
","Up until 2011, I hardly knew anything about Thor. My knowledge of Thor was only from 'Adventures in Babysitting' when the little girl was obsessed with him. This movie just struck a cord with me. I loved it! I even saw it a second time at the theater. I love fish-out-of-water stories. Thor has a flare for the dramatic and when he gets to earth, he goes around throwing coffee mugs, talking Shakespearean and goes to a pet store looking for a horse.After Odin banishes him from Asgard, Thor crashes on Earth, right into Jane Foster. His hammer, Mjolnir lands about 50 miles away. Whoever is worthy will be able to wield it. Thor takes Jane on his mission to retrieve it, but he cannot pick it up because Odin took all his powers away.Meanwhile. Thor's adopted brother, Loki looks to control Asgard and sends a Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor and annihilate the town he's in. Thor and Loki go head to head in a fight between brothers. There's plenty of action, comedy and sci-fi. If you love Norse mythology and comic book movies, you'll love THOR!!!",10,2,4,30 April 2019
The Disaster Artist," An Absolute Blast For All 'The Room' Aficionados!!!
","I've read Greg Sestero's book three times and I had the pleasure of meeting him a few years ago. My friends and I love and adore The Room to pieces. When this movie was announced, I was ecstatic. I rarely ever say this, but this movie was a phenomenal superb masterpiece from beginning to end. It's so inspirational and full of heart. James Franco was hilarious and perfect as Tommy Wiseau. His accent was really spot-on. There were a few things from the book that I wished had made it into the movie, but overall I loved it and hope it wins Best Picture. The film starts in 1998 when Greg is a young aspiring actor taking an acting class under Jean Shelton. One day, Tommy Wiseau goes on stage and destroys Mar;lon Brando's scene in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and keeps saying 'Stella' over and over and starts climbing the walls. Greg becomes fascinated and wants to do a scene with him, and from there, their unique friendship was born. Over the years, Greg and Tommy can barely get any work as an actor, so they decide to make their own 'real Hollywood movie' Tommy begins working on a hot mess of a script called 'The Room' Tommy plays the character of Johnny, an all-American hero who has many friends and a beautiful future wife. (Johnny may or may not be a vampire) Greg plays the character of Mark, Johnny's best friend who betrays him by having an affair for his future wife, Lisa. Tommy buys all the equipment, spending up to six million dollars on the film. (To this day, no one knows where Tommy is from, how old he is, or how he made all the money) When the movie starts filming, that's when the trouble begins. The movie makes no sense, Tommy forgets his lines and it takes him 3 hours just to do the 'Oh hi Mark' scene. Tommy becomes more hostile toward his cast and crew. The Room is so hilariously interestingly bad, that it's amazing. My friends get together and we watch it every so often. This was a great film about the making of it. I'd be proud to have it in my collection. Another thing I loved was during the end credits, they show the original film side-by-side with the footage they re-created in this movie. A lot of the footage they remade was really spot-on, right down to their mannerisms. If you love The Room, and read Greg's book, you'll absolutely love THE DISASTER ARTIST!!!",10,0,2,20 December 2017
Zombieland," An Awesome Zombie Flick!!!
","This is one of the best zombie movies I've seen since Planet Terror. It's funny, and fun, and a great time if you like horror comedies and amusement parks. Nobody uses their real name to avoid attachment, and instead go by their intended destinations. Columbus is a college student who has rules and tries to see if his parents are still alive. He meets Tallahassee, who is a tough redneck that tries to find the last Twinkie on earth. They meet Wichita and Little Rock, two sisters that are con-artists. After finally getting along and becoming friends, the sisters leave because they don't want to get too emotionally attached. They head off to Pacific Playland to enjoy the rides, but they unintentionally attract a bunch of zombies nearby. I love how they use the amusement park equipment to kill the zombies. I highly recommend that you go to ZOMBIELAND!!!",10,2,6,7 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," An Awesome Film!!!
","This is a great sequel that's just as awesome as the original, and highly lived up to my expectations! Everybody did an awesome job. The storyline seems a lot darker than the original. There is more comedy, emotional moments, and a lot more fighting. It's been two years since the Autobots helped Sam Witwicky defeat the Decepticons. As Sam leaves for college, he finds a piece of the Allspark, which causes him to see visions of Cybertronian symbols in his mind. Megatron is resurrected, and brings the Fallen to Earth, so they can finish what they started, and try to use the Matrix of Leadership to destroy the Sun. Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots must stop the Decepticons once again. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN!!!",7,30,55,1 July 2009
Joker," The Best Movie of 2019!!!
","To me, this is the best picture of 2019, hands down! It was beautifully made, great dialog, great sets, great suspense, great cinematography, creepy music, great everything. It really makes you think what is real, and what is just in his mind. The tone is very similar to 'Taxi Driver' Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely superb and brilliant as Arthur Fleck, aka Joker. He deserves to win Best Actor because he put his heart and soul into creating this disturbed character. I can't rave about it enough.The film is set in 1981. Everything looks dirty and grungy. Arthur Fleck is an aspiring stand-up comedian and a social outcast who has mental illnesses and disabilities. Throughout the film, Arthur is abused by those around him and finally snaps by killing three businessmen who were harassing him. From there, he slowly descends into madness and becomes the green-haired, clown make-up wearing psycho we all know and 'love' I definitely highly recommend JOKER!!!",10,2,5,8 January 2020
Dark Shadows," Finally, a Fun Vampire Movie!!!
","I saw this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and we had a blast. It was a hilarious good time. I watched a few of the original episodes to psych myself up and to understand the storyline, but I couldn't get into it. Soap operas aren't my thing. After seeing the movie, it makes me wanna try and watch them. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a boring melodramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice. In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Veronica Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to return the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart Gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!",10,4,8,16 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Reborn!!!
","I have not read any of the books, or seen any previous films, so I couldn't compare it. I thought Robert Downey Jr. pulled off an awesome performance as Sherlock Holmes and brought new life to the character. It dragged a little in the beginning, but it got a lot better. It has action, suspense, and a bit of comedy. Holmes is a brilliant detective who sometimes seems a little eccentric. Dr. Watson is is loyal assistant. Together, they try to solve a mystery as to how Lord Blackwood rose from the grave with the help of black magic, and threatens all of London. Holmes and Watson soon team up with a woman named Irene Adler who is a thief and his former adversary. If you love mysteries, you'll love SHERLOCK HOLMES!!!",7,0,2,3 May 2010
The Blind Side," An Awesome Inspirational Film!!!
","I thought this was a really good movie, and was a lot better than I had expected. Everybody did an awesome job. There were a lot of hilarious moments, heart-breaking moments, and heart-warming moments throughout. A homeless 18 year old named Michael 'Big Mike' Oher is a quiet and peaceful person. He keeps to himself. He is under-educated because of his past. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael and offers him a room in her house. He soon becomes apart of the family, because they adopt him. The Tuohy family help him become involved in football. Other coaches from universities see what he can do, and offer him a Scholarship. Which college will Michael pick. I highly recommend THE BLIND SIDE!!!",10,1,3,26 November 2009
The Conjuring," A Haunted House/Demonic Possession Movie Done Right!!!
","This movie was actually very creepy and is the perfect haunted house/ghost story movie. It gave me chills, and made my date grab tight on my arm at the time we saw it. It was very believable that it took place in the 1970's. Other movies that take place in the 70's tend to over-do that like Tim Burton's Dark Shadows. When Carolyn and Roger Perron move into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five daughters, they begin to have paranormal occurrences in the house from shadow people to clocks stopping to being pulled by a ghost. They hire Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. They soon must deal with the house and the possession of Carolyn. I would compare this film to the original 'Amityville Horror' If you want a great horror flick to actually scare you, I highly recommend THE CONJURING!!!",9,0,0,12 June 2016
Halloween," One of the Greatest Horror Movies Ever Made!!!
","I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this film! In my opinion, HALLOWEEN is without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made! I love everything about it! I love that it takes place on HALLOWEEN! I love all the characters; especially Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. I love the mood and atmosphere! It has a classic horror story of a psychopath breaking out of Smith's Grove Sanitarium the night before HALLOWEEN and the next day, returns to Haddonfield, Illinois and goes on a rampage and stalks three friends named Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from killing anyone, but it's already too late. Laurie is babysitting Tommy Doyle, and next door, Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace. Michael waits patiently to make his move. I love Michael's mask! It's freakin' awesome! Will Laurie survive the dark, bloody HALLOWEEN night? If you love classic horror, I highly recommend HALLOWEEN!!!!",10,0,2,13 May 2009
Despicable Me," Awesome Family Fun!!!
","I saw this with my friends, and the movie was actually a lot better than I expected. It's very funny, and has a great heart-warming storyline. The minions were hilarious and adorable. Steve Carell stars as Gru. Gru is a supervillian who tries to compete with Vector. Vector stole the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, so Gru tries to beat him. He comes up with a plan to steal the moon. After he attempts to steal a shrink ray from Vector, he adopts Margo, Edith, and Agnes so he can use them to give boxes of robot cookies to Vector. After he succeeds, he tries to get rid of the kids, but he slowly begins to think like a dad and loves them. He soon must decide what is more important; being a supervillian, or being a superdad. I highly recommend DESPICABLE ME!!!",10,2,6,13 July 2010
Carrie," Another Hardcore Classic!!!
","This movie is very creepy. A teen aged girl named Carrie White is always being picked on and made fun by the sexy teen aged girls. (Her psycho God-crazed mom doesn't help.) The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also. The very end with Sue putting the flowers on Carrie's grave and a bloody hand pops up is awesome. Hell, the whole movie is awesome. I would love to take Carrie to the prom. If you love horror, revenge, and proms, you'll love CARRIE!!!",10,1,1,16 August 2009
Iron Man," Another Awesome Marvel-Comic Flick!!!
","Iron Man is an awesome film with great special effects! Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assistant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!",8,2,2,16 August 2009
Iron Man," Witness the Beginning of the MCU!!!
","Long before Avengers Endgame, there was just Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Tony Stark, a cocky billionaire genius that manufactures weapons. After presenting his newest weapon, he is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to build one for them. Over the course of trying to escape, he builds something bigger and better; an invincible suit made of iron that can fly.Once he gets back to America, he perfects it and goes around the world, doing good and becoming a superhero. He soon must deal with his business partner, Obadiah, who wants to create his own Iron Man suit for evil. If you love action and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!",8,2,3,30 April 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Son of Krypton Versus Bat of Gotham!!!
","As a kid, I've always been a fan of Christopher Reeve's Superman movies and the Batman movies started by Tim Burton. Going back even further, I really liked the over the top cheesy 1966 Batman series with Adam West. So, I'm a fan of light-hearted cheesy flicks. In later years, the DC movies keep making their superhero movies darker and grittier, especially with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. When I saw Batman V Superman in the theater, I didn't really love it. I had the opportunity to see it again for free, but I didn't take it because I thought it was so-so. It was recently released on home video with an extended R-rated cut with 30 minutes added in, and I gotta say it was a much better film. More storyline, more action, and a better understanding of Lex Luthor's plan. If you're watching it for the first time, I beg you to watch the Ultimate Edition. It is longer, but it'll be worth it. This review will contain spoilers!When I first heard Ben Affleck was playing Batman, I rolled my eyes and figured he'd be about equal with George Clooney in 'Batman & Robin' but he actually did quite well. He shows more of Bruce Wayne's detective work and really kicks quite a bit of butt as Batman. I'm glad this really isn't another Batman origin story, because it's been done to death, but we do see him as a child during a flashback and showing how his parents are killed. Even though I like Superman as a hero better, Batman was more interesting in this film, but he is war hungry and wants to kill Superman. The film is pretty dark and gloomy and has Superman moping around because half the world hates him. Eighteen months after General Zod annihilates Metropolis, Bruce Wayne is convinced that Superman is an enemy. After learning of Batman's activities, Clark Kent views Batman as a threat, and seeks to stop him via Daily Planet articles. Bruce soon learns that Lex Luthor is trying to import kryptonite and use it against Superman and others of his kind in the future. (Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is almost cringe-worthy. He tries to be every other psycho eccentric we've ever seen, but his performance comes off as awkward and forced) Lex is trying to get Superman and Batman to fight each other to distract them from his grand plan. The fight scenes were pretty cool, but I wish it was longer. Will Batman and Superman set aside their differences and work together? If you love epic action flicks and detailed storytelling about superheros, you might enjoy BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE!!!",8,1,4,20 July 2016
Toy Story 3," The Perfect Ending to the Trilogy!!!
","I grew up with the original Toy Story movies, and now that I'm older, they still hold a special place in my heart. The 11 years was definitely worth the wait. This was an epic, and a great way to end the final story. Andy is going to college, and hasn't played with his toys in years. He plans on taking Woody, but leaving Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, the aliens, & Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head in the attic. When the toys are accidentally thrown in the trash, they decide to go to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted by Lots-o-Huggin' Bear, aka Lotso. When Woody escapes the daycare, he is found by Bonnie and taken to her house. When Woody learns of Lotso's past, he decides to go back, and help his friends break out and get back to Andy before he goes away. It becomes very emotional toward the end, that I cried. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend TOY STORY 3!!!",10,3,5,20 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," An Awesome Film!!!
","I thought this was a very good sequel. I had to re-watch the other two, because I haven't seen them in 3 years. I thought this had a really good storyline, great comedy, and a good message. Manny and Ellie are expecting a child, and Manny wants them to be safe. Diego thinks he's losing his predatory nature, and Sid is jealous of Manny and finds three eggs in a cave. It turns out that they are dinosaur eggs. Soon, the mother comes looking for her babies, and ends up taking Sid back to her 'dinosaur world' Manny, Diego, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie decide to go save him. They run into a crazy weasel named Buck, who decides to help them. Every now and then, Scrat turns up, looking for his nut, and Scratte is one step closer than he is. I highly recommend ICE AGE: DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS!!!",8,1,5,8 July 2009
RED," Not Too Good!!!
","I never read the comic books, so I couldn't compare it. I didn't really like this movie as well as I thought I would. There were a few decent action scenes that caught my attention. John Malkovich had some funny one-liners. Bruce Willis was the better actor in this film. The rest of the story just has them talking. Frank Moses, Joe Matheson, Marvin Boggs, and Victoria are retired CIA agents. They are soon targeted for assassination. They must team up and work together to figure out who wants to kill them and why. Frank brings along a woman named Sarah who is his 'sorta-kinda' girlfriend. Don't expect too much while seeing this movie. If you want a bland action film to only see maybe once or twice in your life, you might like RED!!!",7,3,7,18 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Epic Conclusion to the Harry Potter Franchise!!!
","This is the moment we've all waited ten years to see. This movie is very entertaining and doesn't disappoint. I was very satisfied with the outcome. The battle scenes were awesomely epic. This movie is probably the most emotional, because of a few deaths of characters we've gotten to know over the years, and because it's the final chapter. There was a scene in the middle where I shed a few tears. This movie picks up exactly where Part 1 ended. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still on the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live. This has been a great decade journey. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2!!!",9,0,1,19 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Part 3 in the Epic Trilogy!!!
","The film begins with how Smeagol became Gollum. Later, we see Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and King Theoden heading to Isengard to get information out of Saruman. At Rohan, Pippin sees in the Palantir that Sauron wants to strike at Minas Tirith. Gandalf and Pippin travel there to warn them. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum continue their journey even closer to Mordor, where Gollum has a trap waiting for them. All the war scenes and beautiful scenery are awesome! Will Aragorn become King? Will Frodo destroy the ring once and for all? If you love epics, wars, and fantasies, you'll love THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING!!!",8,0,1,16 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The Melodramatic Glampire Love Story Continues!!!
","I saw this with my friends earlier, and we constantly made jokes throughout the entire film. At least it had a little more action than New Moon did, where Bella just cried the whole time. This time, Bella just can't decide who she wants; Edward or Jacob. She is always asking Edward to make her into a vampire. It still has plenty of lovey dovey moments. Victoria still wants revenge and creates an army of newborn vampires who are reckless and don't play by the rules. She plans to kill Bella. The vampires and the werewolves reluctantly decide to work together and fight Victoria and her army. If you are crazy over Twilight, I'm sure you'll love ECLIPSE!!!",6,5,7,6 July 2010
Aladdin," Another Childhood Favorite!!!
","I've loved this ever since I was a kid. I love the plot, and the direction. It's a classic! Aladdin is a poor kid who lives in the streets of Agrabah who has to steal to eat His friend is a monkey named Abu. Princess Jasmine is being forced to marry, so she runs away. She meets Aladdin and they begin to fall in love. Jafar needs Aladdin to go to the Cave of Wonders to retrieve a lamp.

When he goes back to Agrabah, everyone thinks he's a prince, with the help of Genie. Jafar gets the lamp, and brings destruction to Agrabah. Aladdin must stop him before it's too late. I highly recommend ALADDIN!!!",10,1,1,16 August 2009
The Ugly Truth," An Awesome Film!!!
","This movie was extremely sexy and extremely funny! Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl were hilarious together! I loved all the sight gags, one-liners, etc. Butler is like the dirtier, and more awesome version of Hitch. A woman named Abbie Richter works as a morning show producer, but she cannot get a date. She watches a show called 'The Ugly Truth' that is hosted by a male chauvinist named Mike Chadway who is fixing to teach her how to get a guy, how to turn men on,and how to be sexy. He even gets her vibrating panties! When she finally dates a guy named Colin, Mike slowly begins to fall in love with Abbie. Is the feeling mutual for her? I highly recommend THE UGLY TRUTH!!!",10,2,9,28 July 2009
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the Best War Movies I've Seen in Recent Years!!!
","I was really surprised with this film. I didn't expect to like it so much. The story and characters are intriguing. The action is bloody and suspenseful. It's all based on a true story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a devoted Christian and refused to carry a firearm during WWII. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Doss, a young man who enlists in the army to help people. He wants to be a medic and save lives, but not kill. Everyone ridicules him for it to the point where he's beaten up, and almost arrested for insubordination. His father helps by sending a letter to the court from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. Soon enough, he's released and able to join his squad to the battle of Okinawa. During the bloody war, Desmond will do whatever it takes to save the wounded men, even without so much as picking up a gun. His faith and skills are put to the test. I don't usually go for war films, but this one is special. I highly recommend HACKSAW RIDGE!!!",10,10,16,26 February 2017
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Action-Packed and Epicly Awesome!!!
","Now this is how you make a summer blockbuster movie! The action is so epic and it never stops. The visuals are insane and breath-taking. It has those hilarious moments, and even Mr. Chow from The Hangover gives a great cameo. It's a much darker film and not entirely kid-friendly. I'm sure anyone that grew up with the cartoon in the 80's would love it. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a newcomer this time playing Carly, Sam's new love interest. If you don't dwell on it, you probably won't miss Megan Fox.The Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. They soon find out why they originally sent Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, to discover a Cybertronian ship piloted by Sentinel Prime carrying pillars called The Ark. Optimus revives Sentinel and is immediately betrayed by one of his own. Sentinel and Megatron team up and try to bring their planet; Cybertron to earth. It's up to Sam, Carly, Lennox, Epps and the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons once and for all. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON!!!",10,17,28,29 June 2011
Back to the Future," Another Hard-Core Classic!!!
","This is an awesome time-traveling movie! I love everything about; the plot, the setting, the details, the actors, and the car! In case you are new to the series, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Marty McFly is down on his luck and one night, his friend Dr. Emmett Brown introduces him to the world of time travel. When Doc is shot by terrorists, Marty takes the time-traveling DeLorean and accidentally goes back to the year 1955. Marty seeks the help of the young Doc in order to get back to 1985.

I highly recommend BACK TO THE FUTURE!!!",10,1,1,6 January 2009
The Proposal," An Awesome Film!!!
","I thought this was a very funny movie, had a good love story, good acting, hilarious situations, and much more! Margaret Tate is a strict executive editor-in-chief at a book publishing company.

Warm Bodies," A Great Zombie Love Story!!!
","I'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's zombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and Zombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight' In a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good, and the characters are likable. It has a few cheesy and funny moments such as R telling Julie to act like a zombie so the others won't eat her. Our male protagonist is a zombie named R. He can't remember his name or what happened before the apocalypse. He lives at an airport with his other zombie friends. On the prowl for human flesh, R runs into a beautiful girl named Julie. He begins to fall in love with her, and it slowly makes him human again. Their relationship is very sweet and adorable. Their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal zombies called bonies. The humans and the zombies must team up together to rid the world of the real monsters. If you love zombies and love stories, I'd definitely recommend WARM BODIES!!!",10,8,17,1 February 2013
Beetlejuice," A Gothic Tim Burton Classic!!!
","I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot Gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love Gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!",10,1,3,16 August 2009
The Wizard of Oz," One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made!!!
","The Wizard of Oz is without a doubt, a HARDCORE classic! It has beautiful scenery, awesome characters, and great effects for that time period. This year, The Wizard of Oz is 70 years old, and it's still going strong! In case you have no idea what it's about, I'll give a brief synopsis; Dorothy Gale lives with her aunt and uncle. She has a pet named Toto. When Miss Gulch takes Toto away, Toto escapes and runs back to Dorothy. Soon, she runs away from home, and runs into Professor Marvel. He's a fake psychic that tells her that her Auntie Em is sick, so Dorothy and Toto run back home, then a storm comes and takes Dorothy and Toto to Oz, a place over the rainbow. She lands in Munchkinland, and the house accidentally lands on Wicked Witch of the West's sister, which pisses her off and Dorothy magically have the ruby slippers on her feet. Glinda, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy to see the Wizard so she can get back home. On her way, she befriends Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion, who also seek help from the Wizard. Will Dorothy get back home and stop the Wicked Witch of the West? I highly recommend THE WIZARD OF OZ!!!",10,3,4,12 June 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," An Awesome Film!!!
","This movie was a lot better than I had expected. To me, it was like a mix of 'Saw' and 'Max Payne. Gerard Butler does an awesome job as a psychotic man with nothing to lose. Ten years after a home invasion that leaves his wife and daughter dead, Clyde Shelton returns to seek true justice. I love when he dismembers the man who murdered them. When Clyde is sent to jail, people are still dying in mysterious ways, and Nick Rice tries to stop it. When Rice interrogates Clyde, he wants something in return such as his iPod, and a steak. Soon, nobody feels safe leaving their homes, because they don't know where or when Clyde will strike next. Does he have an accomplice? I highly recommend LAW ABIDING CITIZEN!!!",8,2,4,4 November 2009
