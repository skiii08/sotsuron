Skyfall," God awful and possible one of the worst Bond movies ....
","I really expected a fantastic Bond movie since it was hyped-up in the media as the greatest Bond film, I mean they just had to ...I read some of the previous user reviews and seems there are many that agree, weak plot, convoluted twists, prettiest Bond girl gets out early and the main villain superbly-played by Javier Bardem enters half way into the movie with silly blond hair and is seeking revenge for the loss of his teeth ... enough ...I spent a lot of time looking at my watch and would like to have the two and a half hours of my time back and I would not pay a dollar for a Blu-Ray DVD of this trash.Mrs. Broccoli you need to rethink whether you should stay away so as not to tarnish your father's reputation for the great Bond films he has made.",1,9,20,30 December 2012
