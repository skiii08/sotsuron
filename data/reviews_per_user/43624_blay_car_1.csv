The New World," Don't like it ....
","This movie was a big disappointment,even so I didn't expect much of it. Editing was awful I am wondering how they can live whit it.In some cases the cuts are really distracting.I am wondering do they had so little material or was just the lazy editors..It's a good case how you should not edit the movie!!There is also so little dialog in this movie...The story is very poor..but i am very critical to all new movies,they are just so recycled...overall this movie is bad..even so that the actors were good i have no mayor complimentions about them,especially indians have played their role very good well if you like movies that have just bunch of frames and some music this is it! A real art movie...and so not perfect...",3,10,15,16 May 2006
