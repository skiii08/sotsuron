Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Um, yeah... maybe its been too long since George did this...
","Um I could not describe the excitement and passion that surged through the theater as we waited for the movie to start.  And the great cheer that went up as the yellow letters hit the screen was just eerie.  But then, the movie started.Ok, it WAS a strong start, and it nicely introduced young OB1 and Qui-Gon Ginn.  But my god, this movie doesnt live up to its full potential.  Dont get me wrong it is a strong movie, but there are too many annoying little things which add up and make the film fall short.  The settings were done quite nicely, and provided a great representation of the Senate, and Corusant.  The saber duels, Darth Maul, The Emperor, Mace Windu, the force, and Yoda's classic role made the movie great, and brought me to tears at times.Then there were the dark times of the movie.  Every time Jar Jar opened his gungan mouth i wanted to take a lightsaber myself and sever his god forsaken head.  And dont even get me started on Anakin Skywalker.  He is nothing more than a whiny brat.  You will feel yourself wanting to thrust yourself into the movie, and ramming his head into the engine of his racepod.Thus far, E2 and E# are not out yet... (i suspect E2 will be the best EVER) However, E1:TPM is bad, but not as bad as RotJ.  RotJ is getting to be more and more annoying as the saga gets enlarged.  I mean cmon... well read my review on it... and then youll know how i feel about it...",7,0,1,4 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Saga Ends?????
","As any devoted SW fan knows, G. Lucas ORIGINALLY planned for 12 episodes, this was quickly reduced to 9.  Now, it is becoming more and more likely that there wil be no sequel trilogy at all, and Episode 6 would mark the End of the SW saga.  I hope this is not so.  This is my least favorite of the original trilogy.  It is still a great film, I gave it an 8, the saber duel between Vader and Luke, the Emperor, the DS2, all provide a great movie.  I didnt partically care for the opening sequence with Jabba's Palace, and Barge, but i did enjoy watching several people including Boba Fett fall to their doom. (dont email me about what the comic book said about him using his rocket pack to get out).  The movie is well done, develops Yoda more, and shows more about the nature of the force, and how easy it is for a young Jedi to turn.  A must see on all levels, but dont expect it to outdo the others.  I even now, after watching it so many times still occasionally get a tear in my eye as Vader tosses the Emperor down the shaft to his DOOM!",8,0,1,26 April 2002
Full Metal Jacket," You'd best like this movie or I'll unscrew your head and **** down your neck!
","Well ok, the first half of the movie is so FAR better than the rest, but its so hilarious it makes the movie worth watching over and over untill you puke.  The first half shows life in boot camp in a satiric way that will make you wonder if Stanley Kubirck was a god.  The second half is worth watching, dont get me wrong, but after the excitment and build up of the first half you most likely be disappointed.  But do yourself a favor, if you are reading this and you have not seen this movie, go out, and rent it NOW, drop everything your doing, get in your car, go to the video store and RENT it, it will be the one of the best movies you ever rented.  ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?OMG I told you to go rent the movie! Why are you still reading this....oK now your just making me angry, go.... NOW!",10,0,0,4 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Best Star Wars Yet
","As I predicted, Star Wars: Episode 2, Attack of the Clones brings forth a great film.  There has been much discussion about the dialogue in this film. Yes, ok there are scenes where you there begging for it to end, these are the scenes between Padme and Anakin.  However, these scenes are few, and dont do much to detract from the rest of the film.  If you want a non-stop action movie, this wont give it to you.  There are several action scenes, all of which are great and does what a movie should do, give you enough that you beg for more, but not so much that it overdoes it.  The first hour or so does more to expand the SW universe than any of the other movies.  This has restored my faith in PT (prequel trilogy), and AOTC actually makes TPM much better.  Ok, I dont think im in much trouble of spoiling any of you, for the movie has been out for two weeks, and I have only seen it a lowly 5 times....Yodas lightsaber fight is worth the price of admission alone.  His lightsaber technique is what i have deemed to be 'Rabid Squirrel style'.Mace Windu, the second most powerful Jedi in AOTC, is done in better detail, and has a great fight with Jango Fett.Speaking of which, Jango Fett also adds so much to the ruthless and mysterious bounty hunter Boba Fett seen in the OT.  The clone army, the relationship between Jango and Boba, and the lives of the bounty hunter do much to explain their lot.See this movie, if you already have, see it again, for it is well worth you time.",10,0,0,1 June 2002
American Psycho," Itll spook ya!
","American Psycho is a film that is well done, but will keep you thinking, 'I must be crazy to watch this'.  The strange path of the serial killer is great for shock value, and there are several great lines to put into youir everyday conversation.  However, it just doesnt do as well as strange movie fans would like.",6,0,0,2 June 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Surprise
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  For one thing, the movie for the most part seemed to have the same tone as the others.  I went in thinking it was gonna be about the calibur of Jurassic Park 3.  Surprisingly, this was a good movie.  In fact, it explains why it even exists, because the events of the other movies would make you think that it shouldn't.  If you like the Terminator movies, go see it, otherwise, wait to rent it.",7,0,0,11 July 2003
Spider-Man," Simply Fantastic
","I was lucky enough to see this movie on opening Day, May 3rd.  I was blown away.  My god, the movie was great.  Words cannot fully describe how much I enjoyed this movie.  I really was shocked, i didnt think that the Movie would come close to doing the Comicbook-classic justice.  But the webslinger arrives in style, and catches the audience just like flies. (laff) Lots of action which will keep you on the end of your seat throughout most of the movie.  Anyone who allows the absence of the web canisters bog them down is a fool, a FOOL I tell you!! SEE this movie, at least 3 times, i know i will. 9/10",10,0,0,4 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Overall, its a Great Movie
","Strong acting and character development, and a well paced movie.  Another great thing is that its not that perdictable either.  I'm not the biggest racing movie fan, but i loved the movie.  Its a great movie, and well worth the 9$ i paid to see it.  The only thing i can honestly say that disappointed me about the movie was that it was a little too obvious where they cut a scene or two... but it didnt take away from the movie that much.",Null,1,1,3 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Definately one of the BEST films of all time.
","This movie alone is a huge reason why sci-fi survived the 70s.  Thank god George Lucas saved a genre that otherwise usually brought cheesy crapo movies.  Star Trek had been out for about a decade by the time this movie came out, and it saved the genre.  Star Wars serves something for everyone from the hijinx of C-3PO and R2-D2, to the mystical powers and introduction of the force, this movie has it all.  Sir Alec Guiness, although he didnt intend to do so, will always live on as Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Many people feel the same for other performers in this movie, and the rest of the Star Wars Saga.  I call this the 'James T. Kirk' sydrome.  (of course named after William Shatner's role in ST years eariler, one of the first actors to forever be immortalized into a single role).  Without Star Wars this world would be a different place, for no movie has touched so many people and nosaga is as timeless.",10,0,0,26 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Dark Side compels you to see this movie!
","Most sci-fi fans, and just plain ol' SW fans agree:  This movie is the best of the original trilogy.  I have yet to see attack of the Clones, but if TESB is any indication AotC will be the best of the prequel trilogy.  The Empire Strikes back provides much more action than the first, and provides some much more interesting landscapes than Tatooine did.  Bespin provides a nice look into the technology and spledor of the SW universe.  The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian pays off big, as the audience is given a better development of Han Solo.  In addition, the character development continues, and gives more insight into the desperation of the Rebel Alliance.  The Battle of Hoth is very well done, and easily outdoes the Battle of Yavin and the Battle of Endor.  If, for some reason you have been living on the moon for the past 22 years, SILENTLY get a copy and watch it, for the ending is one that no man should be told in advance. I unfortunately was born in 1984, and so by the time I was old enough to watch ESB, i knew of the ending's shocker.  The best SW movie is feinately one to cheerish and will live on forever in the SW saga.",10,0,0,26 April 2002
