Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," errrrrrrrr okay!
","I'm going to start with the usual clichés, if you have read the book give this film a HUGE miss......because it is garbage!! If you haven't read the book then this film is actually really good!! You have to ignore the so many 'but, wait a minute..' moments in this, I presume the director (and ironically the writer of the book as well who was either a producer or director, i forget) both couldn't be bothered with trying to follow a story that worked so well in the book!!Well that's me done, cant think of anymore clichés, just don't read the book but enjoy the film ;-)",5,0,2,24 October 2012
