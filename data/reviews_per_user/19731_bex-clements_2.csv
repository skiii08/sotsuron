The Hangover," Predictable, Boring, NOT funny
","The Hangover / Marmite... love or hate by the looks of the reviews...I don't get the fuss. Everyone was raving about saying it was hilarious. Me and my boyfriend watched it and... meh. I get the plot, a little overdone in TV/film/books but OK lets run with it... The 'funny bits' were so cliché - tiger in your bathroom - opening door on head - funny Asian guy - finding a baby - losing your friend - marrying a hooker - 'special' relative - etcetcAnd I got to the stage where I could spot the catchphrases the film was hoping would catch on - wolf pack - you gonna f** with me - ' Chinese nuts ' - even stealing ' what you talking bout willis ' - etcetcIt was also seriously predictable.. knowing they won't remember anything after the drink - losing the groom - the sensible guy getting in most trouble and lying to his gf then eventually leaving - the hostage guy not being the right man - they get back to the wedding JUST in time blah blah zzzzzzzAnd the ending - oh I remember! He's on the roof * whistle and go back to the roof where he is * An anti climax that almost made me angry it was so poorly and effortlessly written.This movie was also full of little flaws. And I don't mean IMDb users going anal on spotting the directors elbow in a shot... I mean obvious stuff - finding a baby in your hotel room and taking it out with you??? ( Woulnd't be calling the police no? ) - A police car in a valet and being handed over to the guys without any checking who they are - A tiger being knocked out by a date rape drug ( which as shown by the guys, makes you forget, not pass out ) - The police using the guys as a taser example, infront of kids, letting kids use tasers ( I guess this is supposed to be a funny bit - it's not ). It is hard to enjoy the movie and look past these things, it's just distracting from the storyline ( which was cliché... wait maybe that was a good thing then )I thought this movie was rubbish. I stayed awake in it, but only because I was waiting to laugh. For that reason I'll give it a generous 4.Am going to watch the hangover 2 now ( I have been told it is funnier ) - I can believe that, it is not hard to be funnier than the hangover 1.",4,11,20,10 August 2011
Cars 2," Why is the 'baddy' German?
","There is a lot that could be said about this film, but the 1 thing that particularly bugged me is that the 'baddie' is German. Not just that he is German, but in the story plot about fuel that he is. I want to get this straight, I am English and have neutral feelings about Germans, I also watched this film with dutch dubbed voices. It just really grated on me that the hero is American and the baddie German - as it almost always is in an American production.As you know, the story is about Germans trying to slander the bio fuel company in order to get everyone to buy petrol (gas). - In short.In reality, Germans are friendly, welcoming, polite and compared to the Americans, very eco friendly. When it comes to politics, the Germans never made up a war in order to drain a country of petrol for profit and before people start to drag up the world wars - please do your research on it and you will find the German people suffered as much as any. German doesn't equal Nazi.But once again, stereotypical views from uneducated people has to another film produced where the Germans are bad and American the perfect hero ( example - die hard ).This is a really false and bad view of Germans to be showing to children and for this reason, I really hated this film and had I known it previous, I wouldn't have gone along to support it nor take a child with me.In terms of graphics it as pretty as ever, but in 2011 that doesn't impress so much any more. I do enjoy spotting the car cliché objects also, for about 5 minutes. Cars 2 won't be one I will be adding to my DVD collection, put it that way.Still waiting on Monsters inc 2 ( don't ruin that please!! )",Null,2,4,7 August 2011
