Requiem for a Dream," The reason we invented celluloid
","*Requiem* is an experience. It is a ride. It is a descent into hell itself. Your eyes do not want to leave the screen, yet they want to look away from the horror of it all. I'm still shaking, and not just because it's cold outside. If there is a theater anywhere near you showing this movie, see it at a theater. I don't think it can have quite the same impact on a small screen.The movie follows four characters. Sara, mother of Harold, is an obsessive TV-watcher who becomes addicted to diet pills when she is told she has won a chance to be on TV. Harry, his friend Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion all shoot heroin and snort cocaine. The simple blurb is that the movie shows how each character's addiction to drugs destroys him.Darren Aronofsky's touch is evident. Remember those oh-so-cool quick cuts of Max popping pills that emphasized how routine the action was? Well, that technique is back, and with a vengeance. In a few seconds you get cut - drop - roll - snort - dilate, complete with sound effects. It's a wonder this didn't get nominated for sound editing; the effect is amazing. Aronofsky also has another trick up his sleeve in that in several scenes, he uses a split screen to his advantage. Even the opening credits should be noted, the way the white names appear on the black for a few seconds, and then the black eats away at them until they are devoured.Speaking of devoured, don't be surprised if after seeing this movie, you're a tad afraid of your refrigerator.For the first third or so, the movie is very beautiful. The relationship between Harry and Marion is portrayed effectively, lovingly, by both the actors and the director. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the scene in which Harry and Marion lie head to head with feet pointed in opposite directions, and the camera circles slowly above them, and in their calm, drug-induced bliss, they express their love. 'You make me feel human,' she says.The actors themselves, too, are beautiful. Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans. You see them, how happy they are...and you watch them destroy themselves. The acting, as it must be, is excellent. Marlon Wayans actually *can* act, my friends. And Ellen Burstyn, nominated (and rightly so) for an Academy Award, has a lot to handle for her role, and she executes it with unflinching grace. Watching her onscreen, seeing her face and what it does, you wonder how she's doing it, how horrible it must be inside her head to make it so convincing.As he did in *Pi*, Aronofsky uses music to its full potential, with a haunting score, the strings performed by the Kronos Quartet. I just saw *Yi Yi*, which uses almost no music but for the beginning and end, and I greatly appreciated that. Life has no soundtrack; it was effective. But I am once again reminded how much music can do for a film.Words really can't describe how this movie feels.During the horrific climactic sequence (you'll know it when it happens), my whole body had chills running through it. I felt the beginnings of tears in my eyes. I knew that if it pulled the right strings, it might get tears from me. It was just absolutely horrible to watch what these people had become. They weren't *bad* people. They all had their dreams...and all they received was a requiem. After the heartbreaking denouement ended to begin the credits, I couldn't move. I couldn't speak.There is *no* redemption in this film. The title tells it all. This is a requiem. This is not a happy movie. At all. It won't restore your faith in humanity. It will restore your faith in film, however, and what it can do. (Why this movie wasn't nominated for more Oscars is beyond me. Technically, this movie is masterful. Editing, Directing, Sound, Score...all should have been nominated. As long as Darren Aronofsky stays true to himself and doesn't succumb to the Hollywood machine, the next *Batman* is going to kick serious butt.)I am glad that this movie was simply about the horrors of drug addiction. If someone could make a movie this effective, this powerful, about the horrors of humanity in general, I just might have to go kill myself.",10,0,0,6 June 2001
Unbreakable," Really good, just short of greatness.
","*Unbreakable* is a very good movie that falls short of greatness.M. Night Shyamalan's direction is in top form. There was hardly a scene in the movie where I wasn't consciously thinking, wow, cool. The direction isn't so much flashy as adamantly non-traditional. He seems to have a preoccupation with mirrors. Many scenes are filmed as reflections off of mirrors, TV screens, or glass cases. The glass does have symbolic value, as does the reflection. Some shots are upside down. One scene is shot from behind curtains being beat by the wind, so you intermittently see the action in between. Conversations are frequently filmed from far away. Oh, and he uses a lot of one-take shots. I love and have a lot of respect for one-take shots. He plays with the camera, hardly ever doing what we think he'll do.As the opening text intro will tell you, the movie is about comic books. You didn't know that, did you? Yes, apparently Mr. Shyamalan read one too many comic books as a kid, and he dreamed up a movie about the idea that maybe the ideals of comic books can occur in real life, and he then struck a nerve in me because he tackles one of my favorite themes, that of the duality of things. To have good, you must have evil. To have the unbreakable, you must have the breakable.Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors, as is Samuel L. Jackson, and they don't disappoint.Did I mention Shyamalan's use of color? Like in *The Sixth Sense* where he used the color red to signify...I forget, I haven't seen it in a while...but anyway, here he again uses bright color for symbolic value. If you pay attention, it will help you figure out the ending. Yes, I now realize how dumb I was for not seeing the ending coming. And the movie ends. And it has two wholly unnecessary text impositions denoting the fates of the two main characters, and they are way out of place and I wish they weren't there. According to IMDb, they weren't there originally, and I don't understand why Shyamalan, who, as I have pointed out, is an obviously competent director, put them in. And I am left with a feeling that something was missing from the movie. It didn't achieve its full potential. It had a very intriguing idea, and he used it well, but...something was missing. He could have done more with it, I don't know. Extended the meditation, the philosophy, to mean more.The music is very good as well. Very atmospheric. I liked it.So don't believe people who tell you it's crap, because it most definitely isn't. I think some people may be completely and utterly satisfied by it. I can't pinpoint where it went wrong. You might not think it goes wrong at all.",Null,0,0,6 June 2001
Memento," Blows your mind, then asks you to put it back together.
","Really, you need to see this movie. You've never seen anything like it.This movie requires a hell of a lot of thought. Unlike normal movies which move forward, you don't have to remember every little bit of what happened before all the time. But here, since you see everything backward, you have to keep in your mind what's going to happen so you can make sense of things that *have* happened. At a point, I got worried, because I knew the end was near and I hoped it didn't have a bad ending to ruin a perfectly good movie. But oh, the end is great. By the end, you'll be throughly confused, or pleased if you think you've got it figured out. Don't see it alone; you're going to want people to talk about it with afterward. We think we've got it figured out. But not completely. I'd need to see it again in more detail, and it may even be helpful to view the movie *forwards*.There is the plot at hand, and there is the pervasive meditation on the nature of memory. Memories change. What is real? Truth, lies, all blend into one.Part of the movie does move forward, though, in scenes intercut between the reverse vignettes. It's brilliant, really, having Leonard telling his story to someone on the phone, conveniently telling us as well, so we are educated about his condition and what he's done about it.Notably, the story is told backwards. Much has been made of the fact that a *Seinfeld* episode did it, and so did Harold Pinter's *Betrayal*, and I'm sure others as well, but here there is a very damn good reason for it. By watching the events in reverse, *we* are in Leonard's shoes. We feel the same disorientation, the same confusion. He can't remember what he's done, and we can't see the next few minutes of the reel. This leads to some absolutely hilarious jokes, as well as some cleverly ironic twists.Teddy (Joe Pantaliano of *Matrix* fame) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, also of *Matrix* fame), apparently. There are very few characters in the film, but the few there are are very important.*Memento* is about Leonard Shelby (played beautifully by Guy Pearce, of *L.A. Confidential* fame), a man who is trying to find the man that raped and murdered his wife. There's just one problem: trying to stop it, he took a blow to the head, and now he has a unique amnesia where he cannot for new memories. He can remember everything before the incident, but every fifteen minutes, his short-term memory is wiped clean. He must take pictures, leave himself notes, give himself tattoos. Whom can he trust?You've heard the hype, I'm sure. And I'm just going to add to it, and tell you to get off your damn computer and go see this movie.I saw *Memento*! And it was freaking awesome! Christopher Nolan is my new hero.",10,0,1,6 June 2001
American Pie," Not as funny as it thinks it is
","I just watched *American Pie*, the much-talked about blockbuster hit of the summer of '99, the year that many, many far superior movies came out.The Matrix. eXistenZ. Run Lola Run. The Blair Witch Project. Three Kings. American Beauty. Go. And those are just some of the ones I've *seen*.Highlights of *American Pie* include the presence of Alyson Hannigan, Natasha Lyonne, and Tara Reid having an orgasm. And scattered amusing scenes, and a couple good lines.But it's really not that funny, unless you find it funny. Sex can be funny, yes. *Sex and the City*, *Election*, and countless others have proved that sex can be done very humorously to affect me. I'm not going to try to analyze what they do, but I do know what *American Pie* does: It assumes that anything involving sex is inherently funny. A guy screwing an apple pie? Okay, kind of amusing, but the scene's a huge letdown since you basically see everything you could possibly see in the trailer. It's like the *Scary Movie* philosophy: People having sex is funny.And then there's the scene where the stereotypical jerk spikes the oddball's mochaccino with laxatives. Okay, now how many freaking times have I seen someone's drink spiked with laxatives for comic effect? I think I've lost count. It may have been a bit funny the first time, but it's not now, and we definitely don't need to see anyone on a toilet with repulsive sound effects. Is this the best Adam Herz could do? Perhaps my idea of clever is different from everyone else's.So *American Pie* didn't suck, per se. It had its moments, and I laughed more at it than I laughed at *Big Momma's House* (I think that made me laugh...twice), although I'm sure the filmmakers thought I would laugh more.",Null,0,1,6 June 2001
Spider-Man," My Really Good Movie Sense is tingling!
","*Spider-Man* rocked. There's my two-word review. Details to follow.I saw *X-Men*, and I thought pretty highly of *that* comic book movie too. I was familiar with it only through the animated series, and the same thing held for *Spider-Man*. How would this compare?I've decided I can't really make that comparison, because one movie is about a group of superheroes and one is about one particular superhero. Yeah, I'm copping out. Well, they're different approaches...and well, I'm not going to get into that, because I'm not comparing the two movies, I'm reviewing the one.Oh, where to begin?So we were all wary about Tobey Maguire. Cause, like, Tobey Maguire? As Spider-Man? Suuuure.Dude. He kicked web. He gets put through all kinds of emotions in this movie, and if you don't believe me, apparently even the critics are praising his performance.The thing with Spider-Man is that he's not Spider-Man, he's Peter Parker, the nerdy high school kid that everyone picked on. I don't think I realized how much I had in common with Spidey until I saw this movie.Kirsten Dunst with red hair. Kirsten Dunst with any hair. I have no complaints. At least David Koepp (yon screenwriter) gave MJ a decent amount of character. And she called Peter 'tiger'! (I was all about the yelping at things like that.)Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn...well, the guy looks creepy enough. I wasn't so much a fan of the way they handled the split-personality thing with Norman and the Green Goblin. It didn't translate so well to film. Plus, he sounds like Wario. He was a fair villain, and he was a good choice for the first film because of the way they integrated his son Harry into the MJ romance, but I can't wait for the other, more fun villains.Doc Oc and the Lizard in the sequel!I want to see Venom! God, I want to see Venom...there, the split-personality thing might come off better...maybe. And Mysterio! Mysterio rules. Chameleon! Maybe not. Scorpion! Rhino! All the other ones!The origin story takes quite a while; Raimi doesn't rush it too much. (The movie's amazingly well paced. Never a dull moment.) And, well, it's just something else to see it on the big screen. It packs so much power. I don't know how many of you are familiar with it, so I won't go into too much detail, but...really. I can't imagine having to live with that.The Peter-MJ romance is so damn cute. Koepp writes him an amazingly sweetly beautiful declaration of love. And they of course dance around how much they love each other, and when she finally tells him...*sigh* Yeah.Ooh, upside-down kiss! I wouldn't mind upside-down kissing Kirsten Dunst. Of course, I wouldn't mind right-side up kissing her, either.I wasn't sure whether the CGI webslinger was going to work or not, but it *really* did. It looked like what it would look like if someone actually moved like him. Oh, the webslinging was awesome. God, it was cool. There was some fun cinematography. Nothing really phenomenal, but still great.Danny Elfman does a great job with the music. Very superhero-y.What else, what else...corny one-liners! My favorite:'You're the one whose out, Gobby. Out of your *mind*!'Really, they look fine in comic books, but when you actually *say* them...hee hee hee.The movie has a more comic book feel to it than *X-Men*. The opening and closing narrations sound exactly like ones you'd find in an issue. Also, Raimi sometimes overdoes the voiceovers or flashes or the whatever you call it when you fade an image in on half the screen.But the way he does the Spider Sense is pretty damn slick, though.Oh! I have to mention J. Jonah Jameson, because he looks *exactly* like he's drawn, and he's hilarious.I'm informed that they do play the original Spidey theme at the end, so stick around.All in all, Sam Raimi and David Koepp have delivered one *hell* of a movie, complete with all the angst of being a teenage superhero. Romance. Secret identities. Fighting. Explosions. Upside-down kissing. Webslinging. New York pride. Dr. Pepper.I can't *wait* for the next one.",Null,0,0,4 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Transcendently beautiful. A contribution to cinema.
","*Moulin Rouge* is unlike any movie you've ever seen, even though it's just like every movie you've ever seen. It is the classic tale of boy loves girl, girl loves boy, one-dimensional villain gets in the way, the lovers spout cliches, and then either they live happily ever after, one of them dies, or they both die. Somehow, though, it transcends all these cliches and becomes something magnificent.A beautiful and often hilarious movie, it will probably be criticized as being 'style over substance.' Hogwash. *Moulin Rouge* is a ride. Not a Tunnel of Love, but more like a Wind Tunnel of Love. A radio DJ said of the movie, 'It's like you stuck No-Doze in every orifice of your body and drank a Mt. Dew.' For much of the first half, this is largely true. It almost feels like you're watching a music video, with frenetic action accelerated by dozens of frenzied cuts. Luhrmann recalls the slapstick comedy of yore, complete with exaggerated pratfalls and goofy sound effects. He immerses you in this world. I turned to my friend and said, 'This is the craziest ****ing movie I've seen in a long time.' The camera...oh, the camera. It zooms in and out, and flies around the elaborate set. The film is a directorial field day for Luhrmann. He creates a fairytale world, complete with a drug-induced Green Fairy voiced by Ozzy Osbourne.Like *A Knight's Tale*, it uses anachronistic music. Although I haven't seen *A Knight's Tale*, I believe it is far more effective here. In the Moulin Rouge, music and songs from the 20th century become integrated into the world of 1900 Paris. The amazing thing is, it fits. The patrons of the cabaret chant, 'Here we are now, entertain us, we feel stupid and contagious.' Luhrmann uses the music as if it were actually in existence at that time, and by doing so, he shows the universality of it. Music is one of those universal languages, and the most universal form of all is the love song. Whether it is 1900 Paris, 1987 Chicago, or 1473 Spain, love is love. The words Madonna, Sting, Elton John, and countless others used to portray love would have been just as appropriate back then, but they never had a chance to hear them. In one brilliant sequence, Christian (Ewan MacGregor) and Satine (Nicole Kidman) sing a dialogue about love, fluidly jumping from love song to love song, lyric to lyric. They don't sing these songs as songs; they sing them like they *mean* them. It is like a very trippy musical.The fact that Luhrmann pulls together a great deal of love songs is the key to appreciating the movie, because the love between Christian and Satine is idealized. It simply comes into existence and is there in its purest form between them, without logic, without sense. Over and over again, we are reminded that above all, this story is about love. And it really is *about* love. It is love in cinematic form. It is a visual and aural representation of what love is, what it means, and how important it is to human beings.The movie would not be able to get this across if Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman (looking more beautiful than ever) did not give incredible performances. You can see it in their eyes. You feel their pain. You feel their happiness. The supporting cast supports, as well it should. Jim Broadbent (Gilbert in *Topsy Turvy*) plays the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler. John Leguizamo is real-life midget artist Toulouse-Lautrec, a character I believe is akin to Shakespeare's Fool. And all of the cast can sing unexpectedly well, from a hilariously lyricized can-can to a hilarious 'Like a Virgin,' from beautiful love songs to a disturbingly appropriate 'Roxanne.'The music is wonderful, from the orchestral score to the electronica. I advise you to stay and watch the closing credits, not only because you get to hear more music but also because it's not your typical black screen/white letters crawl, and it gives some predictable but appreciated closure at the end.All in all, *Moulin Rouge* grabs you and hits you with the sheer power of itself. When the movie ended, the audience was completely silent. I couldn't really speak. I felt like I felt at the end of *Requiem for a Dream*, except less like I was about to die and more like I had just been handed a transcendent feeling to simply experience, enjoy, and learn from. It is the best new movie I've seen since *Memento*, and as this looks like a slow year for great movies, look for it come Oscar time. Go see it. Now.",10,1,2,2 June 2001
Shrek," Good, but disappointing and overrated
","*Shrek* had a high bar to reach. Stellar reviews, good word-of-mouth, and my own anticipation since seeing the first trailer all led to a high degree of wanting it to be really, really *Memento*-good. While I've got *Memento* on my tongue, I can segue by saying that that movie lived up to the hype, while *Shrek* didn't quite make it all the way.I was very, very worried at the beginning. During the opening credits, they employ more gross humor than I've seen in some entire movies. Burping, farting, bug-eating, implied excrement, whatever they could think of. I was afraid. Where was the wit? The clever fracturing of fairy tales?The clever fracturing of fairy tales, I discovered, was not as prominent as I had thought and wished. Save for a few scenes at the beginning and the end, and one or the two in the middle, there isn't really that much of it. And most of what there was, I'd already seen in the trailers. The Gingerbread Man, however, should get his own movie. And I really love the Merry Men scene. I expected more of that kind of fun, but there wasn't.Where does the other humor come from? References to the butt, farting, jokes about how 'short' [cough, cough] Lord Farquaad is, some nice Disneyland bits...and the fact that Eddie Murphy is speaking. He talks. A lot. But I like Eddie Murphy. The way he speaks, it's as if he believes that everything that comes out of his mouth is comic gold. Some of it's pretty funny. Some of it's just odd, but it's said amusingly. Some of it's just...hm, okay, he said what was in the script. But there are other really good elements of humor that I won't mention here because one good element of humor is the element of surprise.Mike Myers is excellent as well. I could hardly tell it was him. He uses a Canadian/Scottish hybrid accent that works very well. I read an article about how he actually begged to re-record his lines in this new accent because he didn't think he'd captured his character right the first time. It set the movie back three months and increased the budget by $4 million. Katzenberg thought it was worth it, and I think so too. Chris Farley was actually slated to play Shrek, and had actually recorded some lines before he died, but hearing Mike Myers' portrayal of him, I can't imagine Chris Farley doing it. I don't think he could have given him the genuine emotion that Shrek has now.Cameron Diaz. Hm. For the first fifteen minutes Princess Fiona talked, all I could see was Cameron Diaz speaking her lines in the recording room. I couldn't see the *character* saying the lines for some reason. I guess her voice was right for the character, but it took a while to get used to it.John Lithgow's great, but that goes without saying.The animation, as expected, is spectacular. It's just so amazing to see these 3-d characters walk around in their 3-d environment.So, overall...I think the movie could have been a *lot* better. Oh, I forgot to mention the music. I didn't recognize more than half the songs, but I suppose many of you will. Geez, sheesh, I sound like I hated the movie. I really didn't. My problem is I came in with really high expectations that weren't met. There's a lot of great stuff, and it's a very enjoyable movie (Enjoyability is always a plus for me). It does get my blessing and recommendation, but I just warn that you don't get caught up in all the hype. One review I just read ended with, 'but it's no *Toy Story 2*.' It isn't, but I think it could have been.",Null,1,1,6 June 2001
The Replacements," Enjoyably mediocre
","*The Replacements* actually isn't that bad, just, you know, enjoyably mediocre. Sports movies are sports movies, and this one has Keanu Reeves as a football player, Orlando Jones, an Irish guy who says, 'Bollocks!' a lot, a Sumo wrestler, two big black bouncers, a very adamantly focused ex-army guy, an attractive love interest with nice cleavage (hey, she's in a cheerleader outfit for half the movie...), a load of strippers-turned-cheerleaders, and Gene Hackman, among other things. It's hard not to be pleased. And it even gets a bit of a nice feel-good message at the end. And it's fun. All in all, it's a good movie to just turn off your brain and enjoy.",Null,2,4,10 June 2001
Sin City," Quite possibly the noirest movie I have ever seen
","I'm not going to tell you that *Sin City* is brilliant and the best movie of the year and visually stunning and unlike anything you've ever seen, because I'm sure you've heard it all before. I'm going to tell you why you should see it.You should see it if you're a fan of the noir genre. This is quite possibly the noirest movie I have ever seen, and this includes actual noir like *Sunset Boulevard* and *The Big Sleep*. It is positively drenched in noir, from the black-and-white look to the hard-boiled characters, stories, and dialogue. I will give one word of warning here: the movie will feel 'off' to you in the first ten minutes since it's highly stylized. But you'll get used to it.You should see it if you're a fan of comics. Because this will let you see how it might look if you literally transferred a graphic novel from the page to the screen, which is essentially what Robert Rodriguez did. As you watch, you can practically see the panels on paper.You should see it if you love voiceovers. Because there are a hell of a lot of them, so much so that it often feels as if you're being told a story by the characters. This is, of course, a noir convention.You should see it if you like Carla Gugino's breasts.You should see it if you love movies. The way that they can transport you to another world, and for two hours or so, they can so completely engross you that nothing in your own life even seems to exist, all that matters is what's transpiring on the screen.You should see it if you enjoy a bit of the old ultraviolence. This movie is not for children. Do not take your five-year-old sister, for God's sake. But if you can appreciate guns, arrows, grenades, swords, clubs, and ninja swastikas, then you're golden.You should see it if you can't tell the difference between a hero and an antihero, and maybe you think there's no real distinction.You should see it if you liked how in *Pulp Fiction*, three self-contained stories ending up being connected.You should see it if you can handle gore, ranging from missing limbs to...more missing limbs.You should see it if you want to see Alexis Bledel show a little range.You should see it if you want to see something different. Not only visually, but stylistically as well, down to the narrative.You should see it if you want to see a really good movie. Look, maybe I wasn't physically wowed by it, and I'm not feeling all giddy. But you know when every aspect of a movie, from the acting to the writing to the directing to the everything you can possibly think of, is just so spot-on you can't think of anything to complain about? That's *Sin City*. It's extremely solid, and possibly revolutionary. Go see it.",8,0,1,2 April 2005
