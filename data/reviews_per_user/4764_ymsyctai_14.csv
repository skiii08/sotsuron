Vertigo," Back when actors could act..
","So I am a bit of an action buff and get bored easy. This movie has a lot of dialog and story and while I was watching it I was wondering why I wasn't bored. I enjoyed the heck out of this movie and really found myself analyzing just why while I was watching. After a few seconds or so boiled it down to James Stewart and the director. The film has a great pacing, excellent build up when needed and a story that keeps you wanting to know just enough to make you pay attention. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock movie and after seeing this I'm going to check out more of his movies. The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers. The best way to watch this gem is at night and maybe with a loved one because it is kind of a romantic movie.",9,2,4,27 December 2011
The Hangover," Old School >Hall Pass >>>>> The Hangover
","The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers.Is it me or do you think the Hangover was overrated? I mean the Hangover seemed overrated as hell. All the funny parts to the Hangover can be found in the trailer. Hangover was so unfunny that I didn't waste a dime on the sequel. As for Hall Pass.. HOLY HELL, it is funny as.. almost as funny as Old School. Laugh out Loud funny. It is everything that the Hangover should/could have been. If you like off the wall and sick and twisted humor then you'll love this movie. They better make a sequel to this beast of a movie. Hall Pass is what the Hangover should have been... actually funny.The Hangover is a bit of a mystery to me in that I am confused why people liked it so much. I personally know one person that thought this movie was great however he happened to be a 16 year old kid that never seen Superbad or Old School. Why did Hollywood overhype this boring ass comedy? Maybe Vagus paid them? Who knows.",1,7,12,27 December 2011
127 Hours," Outstanding.
",Here we have a hip little movie about a rock climber and the power of will power. Chances are James Franco is a total stone head but the dude is an amazing actor. This movie only goes on to prove that however this film's true hero is the director. He tells a story of survival and uses almost every trick in the book to keep you on the edge of your seat because let's face it... this movie is about a guy with his hand stuck in a rock. More or less the director needs mad credits for this one. Amazing how this is based on a true story. There is a scene in this movie that does something that no other movie has ever done to be.. it made me feel pain.. wowA must watch.,9,0,1,7 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," I hate to say this but.. yawn
",The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers.So this is a superhero movie.. I love those! So this is set back in the 40s... I love that! So this movie has action in it.. I love that too! ummm so why only 4 stars?Because this movie is soooooo bloody boring. Even the action was quick and.. just kind of lame. Lame in a goofy way. It is just a super flat movie. There is no pop in it. I really was bored out of my mind while watching it. The bad guy was the bad guy from the Matrix and how can they make him boring? Just a poorly directed movie. I'm sure it did great but I'm not going to watch the sequel if they make one and I'm sure they will. Marvel is like a two trick pony. Only good things it had as far as movies go are Spider-man and Xmen. This movie was so boring that it makes me mad. I almost want to force myself to like it but I just can't. It is a sleeper.Avoid.,4,1,4,27 December 2011
28 Weeks Later," Not bad
","Makes the correction of action that was kind of lacking in the first film but with the budget that was feed into this movie you can understand why they had to wait. This is more of a Hollywood type of movie; almost like a realist version of Resident Evil. And that is what i like most about this movie, I like that this movie is believable. I also repeat that this is a different movie. They didn't make the mistake of remaking the first movie or retelling it or getting lazy are re-re- redoing something. This is a different movie and much more of a progression of the first film which works. Can't wait to see what they do with the third installment.",7,1,1,7 January 2012
Bridesmaids," Hilarious
",This movie is what the Hangover movies should have been... funny. I can't recall seeing Kristen Wiig anywhere before this movie but I'm going to keep an eye out for her. I never spoil movies in my reviews by telling you what the movie is about especially when I love the movie. This movie is a laugh fest from beginning to end. Well written and never a dull moment. Even though we have an all female cast in here this isn't a chick flick. There is some romance in the film but it is very minimal and works in the story and isn't forced into it just to have it in there. I heard they're planning a sequel to this movie but without Wiig. I could see that working if it is super well written but I really think Wiig would be missed. In this movie she basically plays the sane person that reacts the the madness around her coming from the other crazy female cast. I guess the only good thing about Hangover is that is brought these kind of comedies into the mainstream light.GO RENT THIS NOW.,8,1,3,7 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A bright spot in a year that sucked for movies
","Just to give you a baseline I loved the first MI, wasn't crazy about the second and thought the third was above average. So going off that I'm marking MI4 the second best in the series and easily the best action movie of 2011. What I loved about this movie is that it was almost like a James Bond movie as far the 'feel' of it goes. Great action, great spy team chemistry, cool effects and storyline. The bad guy really didn't dominate the movie and that gave us more time to focus on the team and the mission. I have nothing bad to say about this one other than the fact it was somewhat of a BMW commercial at times but whatever, at least it was upfront about selling out. Looks great in IMAX.",7,1,6,27 December 2011
28 Days Later...," Good zombie flick
","Don't be fooled by my 7/10 rating because this movie does a great job but remember it is still a zombie movie. Zombie movies are.. zombie movies so basically you have to do something with the zombie to make it different from the other movies and that's what this movie does in some ways. It makes a heart pounding zombie movie that will make you sit up in your chair a little. By the way, I love how this movie starts. UK did a great job with this one and pretty much owns it. Even the sequel was good. This is worth a watch if you're into zombie movie but I'm sure if you are into them then you've seen this before and you're just going around randomly reading reviews on IMDb. More power to you. The special effects here are OUTSTANDING for a nonhollywood type of movie. Little wonder why fans are so crazy about this movie.",7,0,1,7 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Outstanding
",The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers.A solid prequel to the original. Fans of the first will love this and so will scifi dorks and maybe just movie lovers in general. The bloody monkey is the start of this movie which is unbelievable. Special effects have evolved to the point in which we can see human facial expressions on a CGI character thanks to an HD camera filming the face of what's his name from King Kong and LOTR. I love it. Great storyline and I love the fact that the movie wasn't rushed as far as storyline goes. So many gems in this movie. This is a must watch. Can't wait to see it again. Will make an excellent rental when it comes out. I'm sure it will love great on blu-ray.,8,1,3,27 December 2011
Insidious," A must see for horror fans
","A must see for horror fans. I forgot how this gem of a movie did but I do recall some film critics hating on it so I didn't run out to see it... now I wish I have. The story has an interesting storyline that is a bit recycled but the direction, details and flow of this movie give you something that has been missing for these types of movies which is the shock factor. So much shock factor and it is so well done. I thought the shock factor in these ghost/else-realms was gone with the 80s but here we see all that goodness back and very much welcomed. It is hard to pull off the shock factor in a non slasher movie but they do it here. Now when I saw the storyline is a bit recycled don't let that fool you. I'm talking in a general sense because you'll watch it and see that the story is original but it does barrow elements but what movie doesn't nowadays? Don't get me wrong, it is a great horror movie and I'm surprised Hollywood still remembers how to make them.SEE THIS NOW.. with the lights off",9,1,2,7 January 2012
The Hangover Part II," yawnnnnnn
","I really think people have no minds of their own. The Hangover part 1 was tame and hardly funny. It was liked a watered-down made for TV wannabe Old School. Hangover 2 comes around and it is almost the same thing as the first movie.. basically all the funny parts are in the trailer and Galifianakis failing as the wild crazy guy. Maybe that's the problem, Galifianakis is so boring and can't deliver his lines right. I think the first movie was better even if it did suck balls. How bad does Hangover part 2 suck? Well, I'm writing this review while watching this movie. I didn't want to waste the time. I'm One hour and twenty minutes into it so I've seen most of it. Just to make sure this review is 100% dead on I'll make sure to hit the send button once this movie is over.A much better movie to check out would be Bridesmaids. It was something that the Hangover part 2 was... it was funny. This movie is an hour and a half of your life that you will not get back. Avoid it and or don't waste money renting it. I hope they do come out with a part 3 just so the same lame morons that waste money on this series can waste more money. People really need to start thinking for themselves and stop believing a movie is funny or good or not just because some film critic tells them it is. Thank goodness.. it is almost over. Bangkok should be wilder than this.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%SPOILER############################I was wondering when Mike would make an appearance in this movie. No were as funny as what he did in the first movie. All he does is sing, nothing funny. Good. It is over. Bye and AVOID THIS PIECE OF CRAP.",1,8,16,7 January 2012
Super 8," Big YAWN of a movie
","The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers.This movie was so boring, flat and totally a waste of time and here is why: basically J.J. Abrams was trying to make a Steven Spielberg type of alien/kiddie movie. It was like a coming of age movie with bad acting, the wrong story back-setting and just nothing. Is it an alien movie? Is it a kids flick? Is it a small town flick? Whatever it is it is a sleeper.########## ########### ###### SPOILER ######## ############ ########We see the alien at the very end and by that time you really don't even care because you just want the movie to be over and done. I really need to learn how to stop watching a bad movie to completion. I just kept watching because I thought it would get better.. it didn't.AVOID.",3,1,2,27 December 2011
X-Men: First Class," Good but not great
","I liked X2, X3 and Wolverine but hated the first Xmen movie so maybe this is the case here. I'm not a Marvel fan boy but that is not why I'm not crazy about this movie. I loved the storyline but wasn't crazy about acting in this movie. The almost emotionless acting makes this movie fall flat before it can be considered epic and that is the problem here. Michael Fassbender looks the part of Magneto but simply isn't badass enough. I mean you see him going around and killing people but he just gives off the impression that a 90 year old lady could kick his ass. He just doesn't play a strong soon to be bad guy and that's the problem. January Jones is hot but her cold acting is very distracting and pulls you out of the movie. James McAvoy plays a prefect soon-to-be professor X and Kevin Bacon does a masterful job in his role but both of these actors shouldn't have to carry the movie. Fact is that Michael Fassbender has a lot of camera time and that works to bring the movie down. Another thing that costs the movie is Kevin Bacon's henchmen. They're are also stone face actors which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't in a lot of the action scenes. Let's hope they replace Michael Fassbender before they release a sequel to this..",7,0,1,7 January 2012
Slumdog Millionaire," Overrated but good... far from great
","Overrated but good... far from greatThis movie is more like a 6/10 or 7/10 max but I had to give it a 5/10 just because you know people are giving this flick a 10/10 without really thinking about it. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie and actually original which and in itself is impressive but still overrated. The acting was good and the storyline is OK but my problem with this movie is that it ignores it's surroundings and the flow is funky. It is a funky type of movie but that doesn't mean you have to have sporadic jumps and pauses that jumble up the flow and pacing of the movie. And when I say the acting is good I mean the acting of the lead kid. In fact his acting is outstanding and helps to carry the movie but the others are notably flat or wide-eyed. Maybe the director was banking on the kid holding the movie together and luck for us he was able to do it but still the director should have known better. Maybe that is why 127 hours was so good, because the film maker can direct only one guy at a time? Who knows?",5,1,2,7 January 2012
