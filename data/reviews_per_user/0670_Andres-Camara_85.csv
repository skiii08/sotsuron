Blade Runner 2049," More conventional than the predecessor.
","What do I mean? Although the predecessor was commercial, the director had printed a stamp so lyrically yours that you had to enter it or you stayed out. I always stayed outside and I've seen it several times. But it is his brand and he does it. It had a touch of its author. This does not have that touch, you do not have to enter any of his world, you just see it, a little long, trying to give a mystical touch that does not get, but you see it and that's it. What happens is that as you do not have to enter, if you like it, you like it and if not then it is not, but it is easy to see it.One thing I do not like about modern cinema is that they explain things to you. When a director, you put a plan again to explain something that happened. In this case they do it and it is worse because at the end of the film it solves it in the final plane, but it explains you and goes back in history.The photography is spectacular. It gets you into that world. It's dark, but it lets you see. It is beautiful and it helps. Along with art and makeup they do a great job.The effects, of course, great. In a movie of this size I did not expect less, but they are well made and support the film.The address, however, I do not finish liking. Use the camera without a reason, change the plane goes in and out of action too many times. He does not have the camera and he does not know how to make beautiful shots. He tries to make poetry and luckily, he does not get it.Music, I liked the old one, in this case, it will not go down in history.But good for the duration it has, it can be seen well.",6,3,6,11 February 2018
First Man," Demasiado movida la cámara. Too much moved the camera
","La verdad es que la película no está mal. No es apasionante, pero no está mal. Eso si durante toda la película tengo la sensación de que necesito que el plano me muestre más y nunca lo hace. Por el contrario en algunos momentos me llega a marear, no creo que sea la forma de narrar una película. Este bastante mal dirigido, ya que no tiene momentos emotivos, no realza nada, no le da fuerza a ningún momento. Es bastante plana en ese aspecto.Ryan, imagino que el director le querría así de plano, pero a mí, es un personaje que no me atrae nada. El resto de actores están en su sitio, sin sobresalir ninguno, pero sin hacerlo mal.La iluminación te deja que te metas en la película. Este bastante bien, seguro que es mejor que algunas otras incluso que las nominadas a la iluminación.No me gusta como lo hace el director. ¿Quién no quiere ver ese momento de pisar la luna más especial? No consigue transmitir la fuerza de ese momento, ni de ningún otro. Consigue marear mucho en muchos momentos con la cámara. Hace planos demasiado cerrados y a mí al menos, me produce cansancio donde no debería hacerlo.Lo que está muy bien logrado es toda la parte visual, realmente parece que estas en una nave en el espacio. Parece que estas en la luna. Es lo mejor de la película.Pero creo que después de todo, después de los Òscar, la olvidaremos todos.The truth is that the movie is not bad. It's not exciting, but it's not bad. That if during the whole movie I have the feeling that I need the plane to show me more and never do it. On the contrary in some moments I get dizzy, I do not think that is the way to tell a movie. This quite badly directed, since it does not have emotional moments, it does not enhance anything, it does not give strength to any moment. It is quite flat in that aspect.Ryan, I guess the director would love him that way, but to me, he's a character that does not appeal to me. The rest of the actors are in their place, without excelling any, but without doing it badly.The lighting lets you get into the movie. This pretty well, it sure is better than some others even that the nominated to the lighting.I do not like how the director does it. Who does not want to see that moment of stepping on the most special moon? It does not manage to transmit the force of that moment, nor of any other. Get a lot of dizzy in many moments with the camera. It makes plans too closed and to me at least, I feel tired where I should not do it.What is very well achieved is the whole visual part, it really seems that you are in a spaceship. It seems you are on the moon. It is the best of the movie.But I think that after all, after the ,scar, we will forget all",6,0,1,3 February 2019
10 Cloverfield Lane," How many doubts do I see watching this movie?
","I think we're talking about a movie that's not being a bad movie, it's not a good movie. For reasons that I comment in the spoiler area, I can not say that it is good even having great things. It has a good script, the actors are great, it keeps you outstanding. You are intrigued for a long time of the movie.I think he has a technically good photo. I do not say the same thing about the camera. But at least it is well carried, has intrigue and manages to keep the viewer thinking that it is true and not.The actors, all five are great. I've never seen that record of John and it's very good.For all this I put a five, could have been much better.Spoiler:Spoiler: There comes a time when you think the woman trying to get in, agrees with John Goodman. But I have also thought for a long time that why they do not ask how he will know that everything has already happened. Nobody wonders why such an obsessive person is not on the radio all the time looking for survivors? The effects are fine until the end. It is the drop I was missing next to the previous doubts. Bugs? They always look bad and this time it was not going to be less, it does not stick to the story. You are surprised when you see the ship, I did not expect it, I thought it was kidnapped, but the bugs have disappointed me. The truth is that when she takes the car is when it seems that something is going to start and ends the movie. Will there be a second part?",5,1,2,2 January 2017
It," Go a disappointment.
","I like watching scary movies, it's a genre that I like, when it's well done, when it's scary and credible. In this case, the truth, I have not felt fear at any time. What's more, when the clown came out, he took me out of the movie. I do not know how the director does it but he gets that about the clown.The final part of the film is total nonsense. I do not understand anything of what happens, the clown's transformations, I do not know why he does them. You have to create the world of the clown and I imagine that in the book it is like that, but to me at least, it did not seem credible to me.It is a sum of cheap scares. It never manages to put fear into your body. There is nothing that intrigues you and when it seems that something interesting is going to happen, the clown comes out and everything falls down.The children are very well, yes, it's a pity that the movie does not follow them.
The soundtrack, also does not help anything. It has no intrigue.The picture that should be scary, when they are on the street is very white and when they are indoors it is too dark and you can not see anything and you are more worried about discovering what you see on the screen than about the movie.The director does not know how to take her. It is boring, it does not make a beautiful plane and less a plane that causes fear.The truth is that I expected a lot more from this movie",4,1,1,30 December 2017
Detroit," I did not know the story, but it surprised me
","I was surprised, because I thought it was going to be a movie in which all the white policemen were going to be racists and it was not like that. However, the film has not come to like me at all. It is not badly done, nor to suspend it, but it is credible, little more than that.From the first moment you can see that, as in all his films, you will get dizzy with the camera. The camera is not going to carry a logical order, it will not be designed to tell you something. Each plane will not have a clear idea, but rather, it puts many cameras and then have a quick assembly, since nowadays it is thought that the rhythm has to occur with many planes per second. It is a pity. It was lost to be clear what the camera counts.It's very long. It tells too many things that do not come to mind.When you put file plans, you get me not interested in the movie. I come to think that why not make a whole file movie. So that you can shoot something if there is sure to be more footage.I see the actors well, thank goodness, otherwise the film would be heavy.Photography, as it is nocturnal, they create it themselves, that's the good thing. It has a photograph that helps you follow it.The address, I do not like it. I've never liked this director. He has never known how to count on the camera. He does not know where to put the camera. He only likes to make quick assemblies. The movie is long. It does not get boring, but it's very close.Watch the movie but do not expect much.",5,0,1,5 February 2018
A Star Is Born," EstÃ¡ bastante bien. It's pretty good
","Tiene una de las mejores presentaciones de personajes que he visto en mucho tiempo. Como presenta a Bradley en un solo momento es genial. Con Gaga no le pasa lo mismo, necesita varios planos pero no estÃ¡ mal.La verdad es que no la querÃ­a ver, otra pelÃ­cula de amor, pero como estÃ¡ nominada pues toca verla. Y me ha sorprendido para bien. No es la pelÃ­cula del aÃ±o, pero estÃ¡ bastante bien. La quÃ­mica entre ellos es increÃ­ble. Si bien la mÃºsica, para ser una pelÃ­cula de mÃºsicos, no me hace que baile en la silla.Es curiosa, o al menos yo lo he entendido asÃ­, la critica que hace la pelÃ­cula a los tipos de mÃºsica actuales en los que importa mÃ¡s la imagen que la mÃºsica.Los actores estÃ¡n tremendos, todos ellos, no sÃ© si para nominar a Sam, eso ya me parece excesivo, pero solo por cÃ³mo estÃ¡n los dos si lo merecen. El parece que realmente esta borracho toda la pelÃ­cula.
La iluminaciÃ³n estÃ¡ bastante bien. Salvo algunos exteriores que tienen demasiada luz, pero el resto estÃ¡ de maravilla. Te mete en la pelÃ­cula y ni los conciertos, que sabes que es ordenador, ni se notan.Como director, no le habrÃ­a nominado. Si bien tiene cosas muy buenas, sobre todo para ser su primera pelÃ­cula, pero no creo que sea para Oscar. La cÃ¡mara es un mero acompaÃ±amiento, solo observa, no cuenta. Pero sÃ­ que es capaz de contarte la historia sin aburrirte y eso que estÃ¡ demasiado tiempo con los temas musicales.No me gusta nada el final. Se le ha ido. Lo ha hecho sentimentalista. Los dos Ãºltimos planos no quedan bien. Imagino que no sabrÃ­a como terminarla.It has one of the best character presentations I've seen in a long time. How he presents Bradley in a single moment is great. With Gaga the same thing does not happen, he needs several plans but it's not bad.The truth is that I did not want to see her, another love movie, but since she is nominated, it's time to see her. And it has surprised me for good. It's not the movie of the year, but it's pretty good. The chemistry between them is incredible. While music, to be a movie of musicians, does not make me dance in the chair.It is curious, or at least I have understood it that way, the criticism that the film makes of the current types of music in which the image matters more than music.The actors are tremendous, all of them, I do not know if to nominate Sam, that already seems excessive, but only for how are the two if they deserve it. He looks like the whole movie is really drunk.
The lighting is quite good. Except some exteriors that have too much light, but the rest is great. It puts you in the movie and not even the concerts, which you know is a computer, or noticed.As a director, I would not have nominated him. While it has very good things, especially to be his first film, but I do not think it's for Oscar. The camera is a mere accompaniment, just watch, it does not count. But he is able to tell you the story without getting bored and that is too long with the musical themes.I do not like the ending at all. It has gone. It has made him sentimentalist. The last two planes do not look good. I guess I would not know how to finish it.",6,0,2,10 February 2019
Wind River," Consigue rehacerse. Get re-done
","¿A qué me refiero? Pues a que al principio, la película se entretiene demasiado con planos que no cuentan nada. Ha rodado mucho y necesita meter planos por aquello de creer que el ritmo se consigue por meter más planos, no se dan cuenta que el ritmo se consigue interiormente.Luego la película coge fuerza, no te das cuenta y ha pasado otra hora y llega el final. Un final que por cierto, me parece muy bueno. Aunque sea políticamente incorrecto decirlo, pero se lo ha ganado.Los actores están todos estupendos. Te crees a los malos y a los buenos. No creerte a los malos habría sido muy malo, pero si lo consiguen.La iluminación con lo complicado que es iluminar la nieve y que no te queme la vista, está muy bien. Debería ser más fría de lo que es. Es demasiado lejana no fríaToda la película es demasiado lejana. Eso es por no tener claro dónde poner la cámara. No te deja que te metas en la película. Cuando estas entrando mete un plano lejano y te saca y eso es constante. Por lo menos el director, sabe corregirse y levantar la película. Bueno al menos deja buen sabor de boca.
What do I mean? Well, at the beginning, the film is entertained too much with plans that do not count at all. He has shot a lot and needs to put plans because of believing that the rhythm is achieved by putting more shots, they do not realize that the rhythm is achieved internally.Then the film takes force, you do not realize and another hour has passed and the end comes. An end that by the way, it seems very good. Although it is politically incorrect to say it, but he has earned it.The actors are all great. You believe the bad and the good. Not believing the bad guys would have been very bad, but if they succeed.Lighting with how complicated it is to illuminate the snow and not to burn your eyes, is very good. It should be colder than it is. It's too far, not coldThe whole movie is too far away. That's because it's not clear where to put the camera. It does not let you get into the movie. When you are entering a distant plane and takes you out and that is constant. At least the director knows how to correct himself and lift the film.Well at least it leaves a good taste in the mouth",6,1,2,16 June 2018
Citizen Kane," The best movie ever
","For me and for many people this is the best movie ever. In fact until two days ago I was classified as well. The truth is that the first time I saw her, when I was little, I did not like it and I even got bored. Once I learned some film, I do not know how many times I've seen this movie. Each time I like it more. Not only because of what this movie meant for the movies, it was a lot, if not because I think it's a great movie.It has a great rhythm without having to do a crazy assembly of several planes per second.It has a great script based on a word. The actors are wonderful. The photograph has never been used again to tell the story.It has a wonderful address, thought, studied and everything to the service of the narration.Costume, makeup, art, everything is very good especially if we say that he is seventy years old the movie.It is based on a multimillionaire of the time and is counted great.Possibly has many of the best plans in history. Already twenty-four years old, Welles was the only one putting on the camera and designing the staging.He had at his disposal the best technicians of the moment to make the film and it shows.Spoiler:I love the layout of the child and his parents when they sell him. What a way to roll. It is a work of art.As he uses the light to count leaving Welles in the dark and putting him to the light when they catch him with the lover.",9,1,2,30 November 2016
Passengers," An entertaining, wasted time
","The truth is that I expected worse, I thought it was going to be a bad movie and I only found a love movie with a great atmosphere. For the duration it has not become long. It is entertaining, although it does not count much at the beginning and does not advance but knows to entertain.The effects are beautifully done. It is logical. It is science fiction but just to set it. In fact, it's a love movie. The pity is that the moral part, have left abandoned and that is the worst thing that makes the film. I do not know how many people would have done what the protagonist does. The actor does what he does, how many would we do? I do not know, you can understand, but it gives a lot to think about, whether you can decide for others or not.The two actors are fine, yes, they have spark together. The waiter is great.A normal photograph that accompanies the story.An address that is not spectacular but at least knows how to take the film forward, but leave behind the most interesting part of the script.It is a movie that will stay there but will not go further.",5,1,3,28 February 2017
The Irishman," The worst thing he has done in a long time
","Personalmente no es que me guste Scorsese, no me llama la atención, pero normalmente consigue imprimir en sus películas un ambiente de puro cine y te mete en la historia. Esta vez, para mi gusto, no ha hecho ni una cosa ni la otra.
No tiene la película, en ningún momento un aire de buen cine, mas bien de televisión. No consigue mantener el nivel de atención, y es que mantener la atención durante tanto tiempo es muy difícil. No conozco a nadie que la haya visto sin pararla.Los actores estan muy bien, es de esperar, son magistrales, pero se nota mucho el acartona-miento de los efectos en sus caras. Les quita naturalidad y realidad.Para mi gusto, como le pasa muchas veces, no sabe terminar la película. No solo es larga, si no que le sobra al final unos minutos. No hacen falta los últimos planos, la película ya ha terminado con la llamada.La fotografía, que era una de las cosas que mejor tenían sus películas, esta vez, le da un aire de televisión increíble. Solo las secuencias de restaurantes tiene una fotografía espectacular. El resto no es cine.El vestuario, el maquillaje, estan muy bien. Normalmente esta es una faceta que la hacen siempre maravillosa.
Pero su trabajo de dirigir, pues como siempre, no me gusta. Le encanta hacer planos secuencia, siempre sin justificar y que no estan bien hechos. ¿desde que la vi, me estoy preguntando a quien le cuenta la película? En el primer plano de la película, muestra a De Niro solo en una silla, pero la cámara gira y empieza a contar la historia. Pero esta solo. Consigue dejar demasiados bajones en la película. No sigue el ritmo. Va cambiando el protagonista y eso tampoco ayuda. La cámara, como siempre la usa mal, no la sabe colocar, o hace planos simples.Bueno es una vuelta un poco escasa",5,2,6,5 January 2020

It is assumed that this is a movie would be big budget. Did not he give them to really age him? I could not help but think, but if you are brothers, how is your father going to be.

Spotlight," I do not know if he gets to the movies or stays in TV movie
","It is a movie or rather a TV movie in which nothing of what the film entails becomes good. It's a lifeless movie. It fails to reach the viewer. With the subject that treats it should arrive and much, nevertheless it is cold. And it is not that it is cold because the photo is cold or what it treats the coldness better, it is not that this fact bet, no, is that the film does not transmit anything. Photography is like a TV movie, as if it were a video camera and that moves even more.The direction is so remote, neutral and distant that it does not transmit anything, nor in a matter of planes nor in tone nor anything. The actors, being many of them of reputation, also do not highlight anything.I do not know what happens to this movie but once you see it I do not think you'll remember it for more than a few hours.I do not understand why it was selected for the Oscars because throughout the year there have been many better candidates in all the facets in which it is selected.

The film is huge in all sections. It gets you into it to the bone. It gets you in those days. You believe everything you are seeing.Everything is real and seems to be happening at that moment.

It is like the goddess made woman who is, but also has sold her soul to the devil and asked, give me a good interpretation in my life and stay the rest. And he has granted it. Her presentation is very good, little by little, and there it is, beautiful with a touch of love and glamour.The picture is great.

Deadpool 2," Que difícil me resulta hacer la critica. How difficult it is for me to criticize
","Porque es una película, que ya la primera no me gusto, no me atrapa, me parece demasiado agresiva, mal educada, impertinente. Si te gusta algo así te gustara, pero a mí no me gusta, entonces no entro en ella.Me parece bastante aburrida. No llego a entrar en su historia, lo veo todo como una sucesión de cosas que pasan. Cuanto más al final, peor me parece. La última parte, me parece terrible. La iluminación no es mala, pero no es buena. No es espectacular como suelen hacerla para este tipo de cine.Una pena que no se aproveche estas películas para alucinarnos con planos bonitos. Si, mucha cámara lenta, pero la cámara siempre observando, en vez de contando. A mí se me hace larga.No sé, la he visto por qué pensaba que sería mejor, pero no lo es.Because it's a movie, that I do not like the first time, it does not catch me, it seems too aggressive, badly educated, impertinent.

I do not get to enter its history, I see everything as a succession of things that happen. The more in the end, the worse it seems to me. The last part, I find terrible.Lighting is not bad, but it's not good. It is not spectacular as they usually do for this type of cinema.A pity that you do not take advantage of these films to hallucinate us with beautiful shots.

Ready Player One," Que gozada de película. That enjoyed movie
","Si bien salgo del cine pensando que algo le falta, si hay que decir, que me lo he pasado muy bien. La película tiene un ritmo estupendo. Está rodada, como lo mejor sabe hacer Spielberg. La música es estupenda. 
Es verdad que echo de menos más planos maravillosos que este hombre sabe hacer, pero toda la película está muy bien rodada.
Es verdad que no tiene la profundidad que debería tener los personajes, por eso se queda un poco atrás la película. 
Es verdad que hay momentos que ha metido mal alguna explicación y se nota que los actores hablan para explicar.
No me gusta nada la voz en off del principio, me sobra casi toda, no aporta nada, no hacía falta.Es cierto que rompe esa tendencia en el cine de hoy en día, en la que todas las películas van en contra de la tecnología y nos dicen que hay que volver a las cavernas porque nos vamos a cargar el mundo. En esta lo que dice y hace demasiado hincapié Steven, es que hay que coger la tecnología con moderación. Los actores, me ha hecho mucha gracia, cada uno es justo lo contrario que su avatar. Y por si fuera poco, con la excusa de que internet es mundial, cada personaje es de una raza, así es políticamente correcto. No me gusta nada el protagonista, no tiene la fuerza que debería. Creo que ella esta elegida para ser una chica muy normal y que las chicas se sientan reflejadas. La iluminación, la verdad es que Janusz Kaminski gustando me mucho como ilumina, cada vez me gusta menos. Cada vez mete más luces por las ventanas. Si bien está muy bien la iluminación. Ayuda a meterte y es bonita.Que decir de Steven, es el dios del dice. Cuando vi el tráiler, el plano del ojo ya me encanto. La pena es que no tenga más planos espectaculares. Si bien, toda la película tiene una puesta en escena y está rodada, de forma espectacular. Sabe dónde poner la cámara en cada momento. Sabe desde donde va un plano hasta donde tiene que terminar. La cámara nunca va sola, siempre sigue a alguien o algo. El plano del principio, es impresionante. Como presenta todo. La película además es entretenidísima. Tiene un ritmo estupendo y la música y los toques a un montón de películas te hacen sonreír.La verdad es que es para verla más veces.
Although I leave the cinema thinking that something is missing, if it is necessary to say, that I have had a great time. The movie has a great rhythm. It is shot, as Spielberg knows best. The music is great.
It is true that I miss more wonderful shots that this man knows how to do, but the whole movie is very well shot.
It's true that it does not have the depth that the characters should have, that's why the film is a little behind.
It is true that there are moments that some explanation has gone wrong and it is clear that the actors speak to explain.
I do not like the voice over at the beginning, I have almost everything left over, it does not contribute anything, it was not necessary.It is true that it breaks that trend in today's cinema, in which all films go against technology and tell us that we have to go back to the caverns because we are going to carry the world. In this what Steven says and emphasizes too much, is that you have to take technology with moderation.The actors, it has made me very funny, each one is just the opposite of his avatar. And if that were not enough, with the excuse that the internet is global, each character is of one race, that is politically correct. I do not like the protagonist, he does not have the strength he should. I think she is chosen to be a very normal girl and that the girls feel reflected.The lighting, the truth is that Janusz Kaminski like me very much as he illuminates, every time I like less. Every time he puts more lights through the windows. While lighting is fine. Help me get in and it's pretty.What to say about Steven, is the god of the saying. When I saw the trailer, the plane of the eye and I loved it. The pity is that it has no more spectacular plans. Although, the whole film has a staging and is shot, dramatically. He knows where to put the camera at every moment. He knows where a plane goes from to where it has to end. The camera never goes alone, always follows someone or something. The plane of the beginning, is impressive. How it presents everything The film is also entertaining. It has a great rhythm and the music and the touches to a lot of movies make you smile.The truth is that it is to see it more times.",7,0,1,19 May 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," ¿Está cerrado el guion? Is the script closed?
","Siempre he pensado que este tipo de películas no cierran los guiones, es muy difícil cerrarlos y como dan tantas vueltas, hay cosas que se pasan y como quieren dejarte tensión, pues te quitan cosas, total que yo creo que no está cerrado. 
Cuando ha llegado al final de la película, he pensado, este es el topo, pero por que alguno tenía que ser, por que las pruebas que me has dado y nada son las mismas.La película no es la típica de este tipo, eso está claro, luego está en que te guste o no. A mí la verdad es que me ha dejado frio por no decir helado. Es lejana y tempo lento. Muchos flashback que no sé qué cuentan. Se hace larga y no sé si todas las secuencias sirven para algo.Que está bien hecha, sí, pero no llega aun así al espectador. Los actores están. No son ninguna maravilla ninguno. Tampoco es que tengan que hacer nada en especial la verdad, con estar normal, en la mayoría de las secuencias vale.La fotografía, se puede decir que es fría por que la película es fría, pero es que no es que sea fría es que esta descolorida y eso si es como está la película. No dice mucho la verdad.La dirección, pues para mí no llega. Si no consigue atrapar al espectador, no consigue estar intrigante en todo momento. No sabe hacer nada más que primeros planos y generales. Creo que no la sabe llevar, ya que esta todo el rato a fuego lento, pero no llega a bullir.Creo que la olvidare en muy poco tiempo.I have always thought that this type of films do not close the scripts, it is very difficult to close them and as they give so many laps, there are things that happen and how they want to leave you tension, because they take away things, total that I think is not closed.
When you have reached the end of the movie, I thought, this is the mole, but why one had to be, because the tests you have given me and nothing are the same.The movie is not typical of this type, that is clear, then it is in that you like it or not. The truth is that it has left me cold not to say ice cream. It is far and slow tempo. Many flashbacks that I do not know what counts. It's long and I do not know if all the sequences are good for anything.It is well made, yes, but it does not reach the spectator.The actors are. They are not any wonder. It is not that they have to do anything especially the truth, with being normal, in most sequences it is worth it.Photography, you can say it is cold because the film is cold, but it is not that it is cold is that it is discolored and that is how the film is. It does not say much the truth.The address, because for me it does not arrive. If you can not catch the viewer, you can not be intriguing at all times. He does not know how to do anything other than close-ups and generals. I think he does not know how to carry it, since it is simmering all the time, but it does not get to boil.I think I'll forget it in a very short time.",4,0,1,2 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," Let's go with one from the west
","The western movies lasted an hour and a half and they had a story like that, maybe it's the problem.Spoiler: The first thing I have to say, to be honest is that Tarantino, I do not like it. I just liked Kill Bill, vol.1 since the 2 is completely different. In this case we repeat again. For me it's a very slow movie. It only takes about an hour to introduce the characters. Where that left to present the characters with a plane as in Gilda. It does not have so much gore and sure that its fans that annoy to them, to me it bugs me the little that has.Having a room with many characters, John Ford, had a golden opportunity, to demonstrate, as he did in Kill Bill, what a good director he is, planning and staging, but no, I'm sorry, neither planning nor staging. All short shots and one by one, in case we get lost. Inside the house, it seems that it is also difficult for him to take pace, this does not advance. I will not deny that you have a nice picture, if you have one. This along with the make-up and costumes is the only thing that saved the film. It has become interminable. It's true that it's a serious movie, but this man does not capture me.",3,1,4,6 December 2016
"I, Tonya"," Tiene sus cosas He has his things
","Es una película que llega a emocionar en cuanto a que ella llega a conseguir mucho viniendo de donde viene, incluso llegas a olvidarte de lo mala persona que pudo ser. Creo que es un poco larga, pero se ve muy bien. La película la levantan los actores, incluso aunque hablen a cámara, lo cual es lo peor de toda la película junto a su peluquería. Están todos tan estupendos que te meten completamente en la historia. Eso si ella tendría que haber sido más joven, es imposible creerse que tiene la edad que dice tener.El empleo de la cámara lenta, me parece estupendo. Hay que hacerlo en su justa medida y en los momentos exactos y eso lo hace muy bien, aun habiendo mucha, no sobra, está bien puesta.Lo que menos me gusta es la parte falso documental. No me gusta ver a los actores contando lo que ya se cuenta en la película.No me gusta ese deporte y sin embargo me gusta verla haciéndolo. Eso lo consigue, no sé si es que ella sabrá hacerlo o sino es que la doble es espectacular y se parece mucho a ella.La iluminación está bastante bien sin llegar a ser estupenda. Se desmarca de ser una película de bajo presupuesto, pero no llega a ser muy buena.La dirección ha conseguido que empaticemos con una persona, poco humilde, ególatra, mal educada, pero que debía ser muy buena. No aburre, al revés, te lleva y te atrapa. No usa la cámara como debería, ya que podría hacer unos planos espectaculares pero al menos esta bien llevada.Te entretendrás viendo una película bastante decenteIt is a film that gets excited in that she gets to get a lot coming from where it comes from, you even get to forget about the bad person she could be. I think it's a bit long, but it looks very good.The film is raised by the actors, even if they talk to the camera, which is the worst part of the whole movie with their hairdressers. They are all so great that they put you completely in the story. That if she should have been younger, it is impossible to believe that she is as old as she says she is.The use of slow motion, I think it's great. You have to do it in its right measure and in the exact moments and that does it very well, even if there is a lot, it does not spare, it is well set.What I like the least is the fake documentary part. I do not like to see the actors telling what is already told in the film.I do not like that sport and yet I like to see it doing it. That is achieved, I do not know if she will know how to do it or if the double is spectacular and looks a lot like her.The lighting is quite good without becoming great. It stands out from being a low budget movie, but it does not become very good.The management has managed to empathize with a person, not very humble, egotistical, badly educated, but that should be very good. Do not bore, on the contrary, it takes you and catches you. It does not use the camera as it should, since it could make some spectacular plans but at least it is well taken.You will entertain yourself watching a pretty decent movie",6,0,0,9 June 2018
Molly's Game," Bla bla bla bla bla
","Que quiero decir con esto, he llegado a hartarme de tanta voz en off. Los mejores momentos de la película, sin duda, es cuando desaparece esa voz. Además la mayoría de las veces la voz cuenta lo que está pasando, no es necesaria. La película podría ser bastante mejor sin esa voz que no hace más que molestar.Tiene una arranque que podría ser intenso, me gustaría que no hubiese voz en off, pero bueno es el comienzo, dejémosla. Luego la película va tomando forma y podría ser interesante, pero es que llega un momento en el que no puedo por ver más que un partido de tenis, de planos sueltos, planos contra planos y un voz que me está contando lo que veo. Me aleja del todo de la película.Los actores están todos muy bien, cuando hablan claro, porque la cantidad de planos que están por estar debajo de la voz son innumerables.La fotografía es muy buena. Sí, es de lo mejor de la película. Ayuda a meterme y a seguirla hasta el final.El director, me ha conseguir hartar con su voz. Con saber hacer más que una carrera de planos sueltos. No sabe poner la cámara nunca. La cámara no cuenta nada, solo se dedica a producir planos sueltos en cadena. Llevaba tiempo esperando esta película, pero ha sido una gran decepción. Ni ella y mira que está muy bien, es suficiente para mantenerla.What I mean by this, I've gotten so fed up with so much voiceover. The best moments of the film, without a doubt, is when that voice disappears. In addition, most of the time the voice tells what is happening, it is not necessary. The movie could be quite better without that voice that does nothing but annoy.It has a start that could be intense, I wish there was no voiceover, but it's good the beginning, let's leave it. Then the film is taking shape and could be interesting, but it is a time when I can not see more than a game of tennis, loose planes, planes against planes and a voice that is telling me what I see. It takes me away from the whole movie.The actors are all very well, when they speak clearly, because the number of planes that are to be under the voice are innumerable.The photography is very good. Yes, it is the best of the movie. Help me get in and follow her to the end.The director, has me get fed up with his voice. With know-how to do more than a career of loose planes. He does not know how to put the camera ever. The camera does not count anything, it is only dedicated to producing loose planes in chain.I've been waiting for this movie for a while, but it has been a big disappointment. Neither her and look that it is very good, it is enough to maintain it.",5,3,8,29 April 2018
Taxi Driver," I think it's overrated
","Why do you think it is overrated? Well, I'll try to explain myself. I think the film will take about twenty minutes. A good picture supports the film a lot, as well as the costumes and makeup and of course, we can not forget Jodie Foster. The film is credible as a movie.I like the beginning, the car between the steam, is nice and elegant. Scorsese does not usually like me as a director and this film is proof of that. The actors are very well, yes, but, I never liked it as it plans, it can not be simpler, it never knew to tell a story leaning on a camera.That if the rhythm of the film is good if we do not count the time lost in what already counted.A good picture is very supportive of the film, as well as the costumes and makeup and of course, we can not forget Jodie Foster, who is so self-conscious at that age.However the film is credible as a film although many sections I do not like, so can not be suspended.Spoiler:Why do you think it is overrated? Well, I'll try to explain myself. I think the film will take about twenty minutes. The film, for me, would end up in the plane of him on the couch with the shot. I should have died and what better end. The rest, what's the use? I imagine it would be a production thing, to make it kinder. The whole piece of Cybill Shepherd, what's the use? It is necessary to tell us all this part of the story,that he does not know anything and that he will pay it like this? From my point of view no. Scorsese's piece, what for? Can you tell us anything else? For me, this all slows down the film. I imagine they would not want to be cut short and put more scripts on.",5,1,3,2 January 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," It could be much better
","It's a shame that directors sometimes do not take every department of a movie seriously. This film, being good, could have been much better, if I had had a good picture and better directed.What I like is that it really reflects the American style. It is not a film of forgiveness, quite the opposite. It's a justice movie. If I have to do something to get justice, I do it. The characters adapt to the events. They all ascend the film and go towards their goal.There are all the great actors, but above all Sam, I liked it a lot. Frances plays a good role, but it's not great. Woody has done better things, but he passes the test.It has a photograph that could be independent film. He has not bothered to make it interesting. He does not rely on her.It has an address that focuses on the actors, gets good performances and tells the story. But he has set aside several tasks and I do not like that. He does not know how to position the camera.It will take several Oscars but I hope not too many.",6,2,3,25 February 2018

I do not know if it is necessary to spend so much time on the train. There comes a time when I wonder if he's going to pick it or not. I think the film is a lot of time left. That if in the end it only needs to see the extras applauding. It has no sensitivity is rather corny.I do not like the actors, Dev Patel seems to look at infinity, it's broken, it does not reach me. Nicole Kidman does not have as much paper to get you.The photograph is fine but not fantastic.I do not like the direction, it's too slow. You have plenty of time.

","The film does not convince me. I do not like boxing movies, but in this case, as it is not a normal boxing film, it does not focus on boxing, it looks better.The best of the film, by far, is Jake Gyllenhaal, plays a very good role, it's a shame that the film does not accompany him.Why do not you go with him? It is long, too, it does not get to capture you, at times it seems more a television movie than a great movie, is not well shot and that is not bad at all, especially the boxing scenes you at least see what happens.There are times when you try to get excited, but you do not get it, I explain it in the spoiler zone.The Cinematography is not bad, but it is not very good either. It is a correct photograph, nothing more.The steering, does not get to hook you, sometimes decays, even if you try to get up. He does not make nice plans and he would have moments for it. In the boxing sequences he could have made some precious plans. It will be another boxing movie.Spoiler: When the daughter accuses him, he does not give her the time, nor does she put the camera, nor does she let you feel it, it happens too fast and you do not see it as you should see it.The punch that tumbles the opponent, should have rolled, as if giving the viewer, would have been shocking, but only rolls like a slow-motion observer",4,0,0,27 August 2017

Todo muy bonito, que felices somos, arreglamos todos nuestros problemas fácil entre todos y a seguir.Eso sí, prepárate a no parar de moverte en el asiento, sobre todo la segunda mitad, en la primera no hay casi música ni te mueve. La verdad me habría gustado que empezase fuerte con el concierto, vibrando con su música.La iluminación es una pena, pero claro, a quien le importa.Eso sí, veía la película y todo el rato sentía que necesitaba más de lo que me daban los planos de Singer. En ningún momento me ha llegado a transmitir lo que tiene que sentir alguien que está en ese escenario, con tantísima gente cantando tu canción o repitiendo lo que dices.Los actores están muy bien sí, pero el actor que hace de Freddy no tiene la fuerza que él tuvo.Bueno disfruta su música que para eso es.So that we like Queen enjoy as dwarfs. The movie itself, nothing at all. Everything very beautiful, how happy we are, we fix all our problems easy among all and to follow.Of course, be prepared not to stop moving in the seat, especially the second half, in the first there is almost no music or moves you. I really would have liked him to start strong with the concert, vibrating with his music.Lighting is a pity, but of course, who cares.Of course, I watched the movie and all the time I felt I needed more than what Singer's plans gave me. At no time has I been able to convey what someone who is on that stage has to feel, with so many people singing your song or repeating what you say.The actors are very well, yes, but the actor who plays Freddy does not have the strength he had.Well enjoy your music that's what it's for",5,0,5,13 January 2019

I do not like it when it starts to explain things in the end, or how it becomes beautiful.The actors are pretty good for an action movie.What I do not like is that the music is very poorly integrated. There are times when you do vibrate with the music that sounds, but in the part of the film that is dedicated to explaining the songs and see that it is a short time, but I get a lot out of the movie.I think he's trying to be too funny and he's superimposed. He is forced when Ansel tries to look great and that's enough for me.It has a good picture, but it's not great. The outdoor part is too natural, it's not cinemaThe address changes at times. Just like the races are very well shot, then for the end, it starts to roll based on a lot of editing and it spoils it.

","I return to see a M. Night Shyamalan movie, I hope this time, I will find the director of The Sixth Sense again. But to my disappointment, again, I do not find the same director. He knew the culmination of his career and since then, everything is downhill and deeper and deeper.Spoiler:You can not get my attention at any time. It does not achieve a bit of intrigue. From the beginning you smell the final result. He never made some nice shots, but if something had Shyamalan is that he knew how to maintain the tension, what's more, seeing what was coming, without hiding it, the adrenaline rose. I imagine Haley Joel Osment had too much to do with it. But now is not the boy before. And that shows. It has a nice photograph as well as makeup and hairdresser. For many people the romantic moment of holding hands is something very beautiful. The problem is that we do not make a movie. The actors do not tell me anything, none, I see them empty and the worst, do not give me any feeling or feeling. Every time you shoot a movie, it's worse than the last one.

","La verdad es que era de esperar, pero es una pena. Cuando empieza la película con esos títulos de crédito tan espectaculares y luego empieza la película y se vuelve una película al uso y termina fatalLo peor de todo es esa norma que se está imponiendo desde unos años aquí, que al final de la película te tienen que explicar las cosas. Imagino que esperan que solo vean la película gente muy tonta. Eso dice mucho de la misma.¿Qué tiene ritmo? Sí, pero uno llega a preguntarse, ¿pero con lo listos que sois no os dais cuenta de que os van a pillar? Hombre cambia las señales ¿no?Me gustan los actores, están muy bien. Pero para lo que sirveEsta película me recuerda aquello de tu eres tú y tu circunstancia. Lo digo por el romance claro.Tiene una iluminación agradable. No llega a ser buena, pero al menos es bonita.Con esas localizaciones, la verdad es que es una pena que esta tan
desaprovechada. Podría a ver hecho unos planos preciosos y a ver narrado la película a base de planos, pero como no, no sabe hacerlo. Al menos no aburre, hasta el final claro.Bueno pasa un buen rato y a otra cosa.The truth is that it was to be expected, but it is a pity. When the movie starts with those spectacular credit titles and then the movie starts and it becomes a movie to use and ends fatalWorst of all is that rule that is being imposed for a few years here, that at the end of the film you have to explain things. I imagine they expect only the movie to see very silly people. That says a lot about it.What has rhythm? Yes, but one gets to wonder, but with how smart you are you do not realize that they are going to catch you? Man changes the signals, right?I like the actors, they are very good. But for what it servesThis movie reminds me of that you are you and your circumstance. I say it for the clear romance.It has a nice lighting. It does not become good, but at least it's pretty.With these locations, the truth is that it is a pity that it is so wasted. I could see some beautiful plans and see the film narrated with plans, but of course, I do not know how to do it.

It's a movie, which includes several styles in one and that does not suit you. On the one hand it is very documentary, on the other it is a film and on the other Terrence Malick has moments.
You can not get into the movie, you empathize with anyone. There is a lack of dialogue that weighs a lot. I would need to listen and know more about them, I can not get close to them.The actors are fine. I'm not going to discuss that, it has great actors but they do not have strength.The photography that is not bad. It is not good either. It does not make me get into the movie. It is not cold but austere. I found it funny, to see that the buildings are now, they are not buildings of that time, I do not know if I'm wrong but I think he has not bothered to touch them up.Music does not help much, I did not like it.It's hard to shoot on a plane and on a boat, that's true, but I think I should have made better plans.

","The question is, have you got it? Not for me. The film is entertaining, takes well, looks and enjoys some things, but the problem is that like many others, treats the viewer as someone who does not think and at that time spoils it, I explain in the spoiler.The movie has a lot of voice-over, which at least gets me out of the movie.The best of the film, without a doubt, Kevin Spacey, plays a spectacular role. It's Kevin and we almost take it for granted, but you have to. However Chazz Palminteri, for my taste is quite improved. The rest of the actors, are in an acceptable point.In many moments I remembered eighties action movies, both in music and in the zoom that the director does. The difference is that it has a deal that is in part very important.Photography is sometimes bad and sometimes normal.The address is not bad, it is simply, normal. It does not bore and is well worn, that if it does not have that tension that should have. But the planes are very normal.This film had an excellent acceptance and was given more notice than any action, the truth is that I do not understand why it does not go beyond.Spoiler:I do not like anything that at the end of the movie, it retells everything again, as assuming that we will not find out and need the explanation.

","A movie that looks like being low budget on the one hand but that on the other has to have a big budget. The best thing about the film is how the effects are integrated, more if we consider that it seems to be shot with a video camera, because of the kind of bad photography it has, although I do not doubt that it will have a last generation camera. The problem when you can only highlight that of the film. Everything else seems bad to me. The actors, well, who remembers them. Make-up and hairdressing, go unnoticed. We do not have any script, which is what usually happens, when it is only pending effects, bone what gives the bad name to the effects and look I like the genre of science fiction, but interesting.

","I think this is a magnificent film. It has everything and everything good. It is not an effects movie, but it has them, entertaining, with history and that even taking almost three hours, they fly by.How can you have so many actors and that everyone is so good. I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks, but I think even he's fine. Being a bomb movie, it turns out that all actors have depth, you all know their lives and their thoughts.It is normal that being Spielberg, with his budgets, make-up art, hairdressing are fine, but you have to.From the photograph, nothing needs to be said, magnificent, as always Janusz Kaminski is formidable. Constant coldness and depth of field for Steven's plans Talking to people everyone loves the beginning. Nobody talks about the ending. I even heard that the film has the climax at first. I think if you like the cinema you will enjoy much more of the whole ending than the rest of the film.Spoiler: The film has an early hour that everyone hallucinates, not for less, that amount of effects, extremely well made, with a lot of rhythm and very well planned. But this is only the beginning because we reached the end of the film, the whole area of ​​the bridge. From here, he talks about values, fellowship, friendship, but most of all, Steven Spielberg gets to direct as he knows. Plane to plane is a true marvel, narrating based on planes, the camera is always placed where it should be, at the pace it should carry. Having effects, of course, but only with the staging and its direction is not to blink. No close-ups at all pace, no, plans studied to tell a story. It gets you so far in the movie that you do not realize that you've been almost three hours.There is a moment in the movie, when the military arrive to tell a mother that her son is dead.

It Follows," Goes to jerks and can not keep up

I do not like scare movies cheap, with noises and someone behind the refrigerator door, the other way around, I like the good ones. That's why I do not like it. It is true that it has moments that give restlessness but there it stays.It is true that when the ghosts come at a slow pace, the tension increases, but it lasts so little that soon nothing happens again and again to become bored. It took a lot to start the movie, nothing happened and when it starts, it is so slow that it does not give to scare.Although technically not bad, neither is it any wonder, let's say it's normal. The light balls hit the windows, they almost blind you and the direction nothing out of this world.In the end I got bored a lot.Spoiler: It has the typical failures of bad horror films, of course, to end the bad vibe, you have to sleep with someone. Not like when the actress wants to run away, she runs away and comes a moment that feels safe and of course, so that she will look behind her, not man, ghosts never come in the back. This happens several times and that is how we are again. To make matters worse when they go to the pool, in the end, they put a lot of electrical things, no one knows where they came from, of course, that does not matter. But to top it all off I was thinking, when they throw them in the water, they'll throw them all together because if the fuse does not go and it's no good anymore, no, one by one, I imagine the fuse would be bad because if they do not go to Have the least day thought a problem, there the light never jumps. Not to say, when he runs off with the car and only occurs to sleep in the middle of nowhere in the hood. What happens that the ghost does not reach there? Would not it be better to stay in the car?

Of course, I do not see terror at any time, but I do not see terror, comedy, or drama, it's a mixture that does not know where it's going.Sometimes it's even too obvious, almost ridiculous, when blacks are all strangers.I did not get long, but the second part of the movie is completely amazing. I do not think Charles Bronson would have done it.We can say that the actors are fine, yes, but they are not great.What has disappointed me most is that I was expecting a horror movie, and I have not seen that even so. It's difficult to provoke fear, but I think this movie does not even try. While it is true that you see it and do not want to remove it to see how it ends, yes, the end is disappointing.Photography, when they are outdoors, I do not like anything. Yes, it's day, but it's not a comedy. It does not support suspense, nor terror. In the interiors may be fine, but not good at all.The direction, although it does not bore, but it does not manage to intrigue, nor to provoke fear, nor suspense.

","The truth is that I was surprised and much and for good. A scary movie that is scary. It is not the fear of the scare that if you take the sound away there is no fear, no, it is fear well done. It puts you in a world that you believe, it takes you to the dreams and it does not fall into the ridiculous one, but that gives you you are astonished.The film, moreover, is made with courage, is not afraid to let you see things, normally scary movies hide everything and then get you on loose planes what you have to be afraid. This is not the case with this movie, you are watching on the screen what is happening and this way it gives you even more fear. In the spoiler area I will comment more.The actors are very well, even those who are made up, do not fall into the ridiculous, the other way around, they scare you because they take you to a world you do not know and it is scary.The photograph is very well used because it is beautiful and in the dream uses it very well to tell.The management is very good. It does not bore you, it upset you and takes you. The planes are beautifully designed, composed and designed to be scary.Fear and intrigue goes up and up and does not decay.Spoiler:There are plans, like one in the living room, that you see what is going on.

Even the child and it is not easy to do.The picture is not very good outdoors, but to make a credible film is enough.Even if you do not have nice blueprints or composites. The director, if he knows how to take the film forward. When the thread is finished, it knows how to change and move on and that is very difficult.Spoiler:For me the problem with the script is that I think that the idea of ​​the room ends quickly and then it has to continue somewhere. You are watching it and you do not know what happens until you discover it, but when you discover it, you do not know where it is going to go, but it is still on one side and still very well. At the second turning point, the same thing happens exactly as well.Another great thing about the movie, which plays the script is that of acceptance. Will the grandparents accept their grandchild born of rape? It is a pleasure to meet these jewels that the world of cinema offers us.",7,4,9,2 January 2017
Schindler's List," If I could give a serious 10 for this movie
","Too bad you can not give a ten because I think nothing is perfect, if I would not give it without hesitation. Spielberg shows again that directing is the best. Narrates like no one and as always uses the camera to make the best shots of the story in every way. With the plans, with the camera tells the story.He tells us a film, in which, although he changes the real story and retouches it to make it more human, since Oskar Schindler used the Jews, as he tells in a sequence, the price of each nationality, which causes us all kinds of feelings.The design of production as always great, he can do it, of course, but there are some who can and do it very badly.All the actors, supported by the magnificent costumes and makeup are great, they seem to be real. Liam's presentation is great, fast and simple.What a way to use ellipses, which are sometimes even fun, like when a woman goes on the train.No matter how much you see it, it will surprise you again.The photography is great, even when we see the girl in red, it may seem simple but I think it is not.The direction, is the own one of someone who dominates to the perfection, the visual narrative. He knows where to put the camera at every moment to tell a story. You do not have time to get bored. He knows when to make a slow plane. Know how to compose so that everything is where it should be and you can have everything in sight. Neither camera movement, nor the plane, nor the short between planes is free.I know it will be noticed that it is my favorite director but I can not help but surrender to someone who, apart from being commercial, is very good, I compare it to a Mercedes or a BMW, they will be commercial but they are good.Spoiler:
It is impressive to see how the sequence in which the architect dies, with a slight movement of camera, characters and staging, is putting everything in place to make you look where you should look. That if it is not going to prohibit you from looking anywhere, everything to focus and everything telling you at once, bring the woman on camera so you can see who is going to be killed while a German drinks a coffee, total symbol of tranquility, for enhance the moment more.

Simply elegant. Move the camera and design the blueprints to tell and tell a story. His actors are always great.

Pawn Sacrifice," At least he defends himself
","It is a film that without being a movie, at least yes that manages to keep you until the end. It is a way of learning something of what happened in this piece of history.I do not usually like either of the two main actors and at least Tobey does not play an impressive role, if he can be convincing.The movie tries to be a good movie, the problem is that it does not get to be it. When you're watching it, you see it's left in every department to be a great movie, none of them are on a level to be great.Photography is not a great photograph. It is a correct photograph, but not astonishing. If it gets you into the age but not more.It's pretty well set up. You think it's the time but at the same time, something fails, there is something that tells you that it is not total. It has a direction that to be Edward Zwick falls short. He is a great director, but this is not his best project. I do not usually like his planning, but he usually gets you completely focused on his films. In this one it does not obtain at all. It has good rhythm and tempo although some moments of archive take me out of the film.I think it will be a movie that will not go beyond its year",5,0,1,2 August 2017
Hidden Figures," She's too prepared for the tear
","It can not be said that it is a bad movie, as it is not. But nevertheless it is a film that being good, the director prepares many moments so that they are sentimental, too sentimental. The actors come to applaud at any given moment.However I like very much as the subject of bathrooms for blacks. He does not laugh at it, it does not make it serious, he does it with a touch of irony and laughter that gives him the right touch to tell you how bad it was not to be too serious or ridiculous.The actors are fine. Costner has a very grateful role. Within all racism, it is the one that is responsible for removing it. They are fine, but not very good. It does not give for more.It is a good movie but it does not reach a six, even if it exceeds five.The photo is too white for my taste.Direction too simple and sentimental. It was easy to fall into it and it fell. It does not bore, it is bearable, because it has many threads with which it has to narrate and tells them. The problem is that it is also noted that it is based on real events.It is very well set. Makeup, hairdresser, art, are great.I do not think it's a movie remembered for years",6,5,13,9 February 2017
Sing Street," Get some things but fail in others
","As a beautiful movie, to achieve dreams, that's fine. Now, as a film in itself, cinematic, it is a little scarce. It's nice, but little else.The director does not know how to finish it, the end is a little I want and I can not, when you see that it's coming, you start to ask yourself. See how you're going to do it? And for my pleasure I do not know how to take it.While it is true that there is a sequence that I will explain in the spoiler zone, I almost get something I have always wondered how you could roll well, like saying that dreaming is bad because then comes the sad reality.The actors are all very well. The romance between the two is beautiful, although I think it would be better if I had not managed to conquer it. For my taste is spent in the locker room, but you can accept.Photography, no big deal, is a white camera video and does not care much.The direction aside from not knowing how to finish it and not know how to do a staging and not know how to take advantage of the concert moments to make beautiful plans that accompany the splendid soundtrack. But at least he likes to see her. You are drawn to the story.He has a music, which is the best thing unlike the movie.Spoiler: In the sequence of the concert at school, when he starts to dream, it almost gives you the feeling that it is bad to dream, it lacks a little rise and fall of blow but it is quite well achieved.",5,1,5,17 June 2017
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," How to make a bad movie with a great idea
","To that I mean, because the film could have been interesting since its idea, that of defending freedom of expression and not for that to be against freedom is great. But what a pity he gets out of hand and does not know how to take it.Spoiler: Why do I say that he does not know how to take it? Because, for my taste, none of the moments of the singer come to mind. They only delay the movie. Maybe because it lasts only an hour and a half, I wanted to lengthen it, I do not know. The beginning with everyone speaking in mute, what's the use? The truth is that I have become eternal and only lasts what lasts. That if I like it, not everything is good in that company, because, why are not couples allowed? Lack of freedom. With such a good idea, however, for my taste the script is slow and poorly run. He will have good dialogues, he has them, but it is not well written. Not to say directed, I will not say that I plan bad, no, it is worse. With seated characters, it has nothing of staging and nevertheless, I imagine that to give him speed, he makes planes cutting heads. Some actors, who are all very well, cut them off or do not focus when speaking. The photograph that if it is very beautiful and manages to narrate a time. Like the costumes and makeup, they are fine as well as art. But these parts can not prevent me from watching the film and thinking, that this is not progressing, that I have many things left.",4,1,3,6 December 2016
Annie Hall," I'm sorry I can't with him
","I have seen this movie and I don't know if I have ever seen it before or not, but some friends have asked me and I have seen it to tell them my opinion.From what I'm going to say when I was studying cinema, many people literally turned their backs on me and stopped talking.The truth is that at first, I laughed a lot, if, up to the forty minute or so, I would rather define that part as a succession of gags than as a movie. Then the film stagnates and is the Allen that I have always remembered, until I got really bored. It doesn't usually seem interesting to me, even knowing that as a dialogue writer it has no equal, but as a director, I find it boring. I am not interested in what you are telling me. I do not see a coherence to anything, it seems that they are all snippets of something that is not known to be.The actors are in his line, he will always be him, and she is very well. The problem is that they don't transmit anything to me.He is a director who never uses lighting, as the photo director, whose name I do not remember, who worked with him and with Bermang, who had been the director he had known, who did more than light and the camera. He does not transmit anything with either of them, he simply does not care.As director, he doesn't exist, he just wants to tell a story as if it were theater. The moments he speaks to the camera, seem horrible to me, you can't get more of a movie viewer than doing that. Surely if I did theater it would be wonderful, but the problem is that they are two completely different media. There is no sequence in which he puts a point of view different from that of a mere observer from outside, he never has the baton.The beginning of the film is a clear sample of what the whole film is going to be, if you don't see it clearly don't follow.",3,1,3,4 April 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Yes, it's worth sensations, but so what?
","I've seen this movie three times. As almost everyone likes and not me, I will see the other time to see where I am confused, I have said several times. But nothing I see no more, at least for now.I can not understand what he wants to convey to me. A sea of ​​sensations, I have heard many times. I just get a feeling, I get bored a lot.It's the biggest ellipse in film history, so what? What are you telling me? Also try to make it as if it is not noticed and it shows a lot.It's a movie that by the date it is, it's a science fiction landmark. The problem is that that part quickly stays old.I do not see a script and that bores me, I can not follow it. There comes a time when I would like to spend it, especially in the final part, when nothing makes sense, but well I'll do it right.He is not a director that attracts me much, few films of his I liked. As is well known, he never gave an end to his films, at least of course, as his sister says, once he died, which is yet another of his strange films. The best feeling, the lyrics at the end, is over",3,4,12,16 December 2016
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," What a great idea, that bad development
","I have reviewed this movie to make the review. I knew I did not like it, but I wanted to be specific. Seeing the other time, I see that I still do not like it, but I see that there are still more things that I did not remember and that I do not like. It's a great idea, although well thought out is a very dangerous idea, very sad and at the same time, I do not know if they stop to think that the human being is what is good and bad that happens to him and remember what he has lived . Without remembering things, you run the risk of repeating the bad ones. I'll need the spoiler part to explain some thingsThe actors are all great, yes, each one is more crazy than the previous one. I do not know how many people in real life would hold any of them more than a little while and would fall in love with them.He has a photograph that I would define as non-existent. There are moments when the light overflows the screen. In others he uses photography for two things, to make a different film and to cover, especially at night, all the faults.His address seems a little boring. I think the intermediate section seems very long. Apart from his typical style in all his films, the planes he makes are sometimes even poorly composed.I would ask people if they really want to forget about their past. It may seem great to the naked eye, but if something makes us human is the good and the bad and learn to overcome the bad times.Spoiler:The part that I like about the movie, the 'idea' of forgetting the bad and even finding it again and falling in love with it would be nice if it were not so badly carried out. I think he spends most of the movie obsessing the character with not accepting what is no longer, however the nice part that you finally find your partner again, you only have a few minutes of film, nothing more and That is for me one of the big mistakes.It also has things as typical as the love of Kirsten Dunst with the boss, I have seemed a total topic.",3,2,6,5 January 2017
La La Land," I start from the base that I do not like the musical
","But the truth is that this movie I did not like. I never liked that in the middle of a movie they started to dance and sing. I can not find logic. This is the same thing. Although the second song surprised me how well round it is. It has a lot of rhythm and is well designed and very well composed and designed.It is a love story, but it is not a great love story, that if the end I kill. It's the best thing about the movie.They are well? Acting yes, but when they dance I'm bored, although maybe I'm not the best to say it. But I have to say that I do not think the couple with the most spark I've seen The photography is spectacular, that's true. She is very pretty. He is cheerful.The direction I do not like, the planes are simple and it bores me.A beautiful setting, that must be said.The basic problem is that this genre either you like or you do not like.",4,4,8,9 February 2017
Life Is Beautiful," How can this be treated in this way?
","I still do not get into my head, a subject as tremendous as this, I do not know how you can treat it in the form of laughter. The film has ended and I feel very bad, but not because of what the film tells me and that has influenced me a lot, no, but because it seems almost an insult to me to treat this subject as if it were a joke. I must be the only person who feels this way, as far as I can see, but I can not help it. Your intention will be good, but for me, you will not get it at all.I imagine that the fact that this comedian, has touched such a dramatic fact, will have been what gave him the power that gives him everything much, but for me, it is still a forgettable film.He does not have a nice picture. It does not have nice blueprints. Your address is normal. The actors can not avoid being very Italian, without the spirit of being derogatory if not as an adjective.It has a great production behind and that only tells me, what a great waste of time and money, could have made a good movie.",3,2,7,16 December 2016
Don't Breathe," A good movie that has big mistakes
","The film is fine, keeps you stuck and keeps the tension all the time. It has very good moments and interesting turns.It also has times when it seems like either there was no budget or they did not know how to do it. I'll comment on spoiler zone.There are also times when it is predictable, but it is accomplished and you believe it and forgive it.He deceives us at some point using the night camera, so let's see, because it suits him well, but I should have used photography in a different way. However the picture is pretty good, if it was not because I do not understand how that man has lights on at home.It has an address that in some moments makes very interesting plans. It tells us and makes us go through fear showing everything and composing the plan. Takes the tension very well and keeps the excitement all the time. It overrides how predictable it is.A film that fulfills its mission.Spoiler:What I do not like is how the time has come to save the girl who is going to be inseminated. I do not see anything, it does not fit the camera well. Also, since when the sperm is kept alive as maintained by the live?I also do not like how he tricks us when he nails the kid the pruning shears and it turns out that they have been nailed to another.",6,1,4,15 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Speaking of hearts, where is the one from the movie?
","There are many movies of the beautiful and the beast. I think this is the best made this and the coldest of all. All effects are great, true but it is that at no time catches me.I think one of the things that does not catch me is the casting. Bella is a very special character, she is not only beautiful, she is affectionate, she is angelic, she has something special and I am sorry but Emma Watson does not have that. It is not a person who sees it and gives you an angelic feeling. But the prince at the end when he leaves, is not a prince either. He has a good photograph, yes, it is a story and shows it to you. Although sometimes it looks too digital.The address I do not like, because it does not know how to give you heart, it does not know how to reach you. He does not know how to use the camera and what in this type of films can put it where you want it because the planes are computer.It has left me cold a movie that talks to you about the heart.Spoiler:The presentation of beauty seems so bad. It is a kind of copy of the drawings, but to present beautiful in general distant plane, I do not see it. The whole part of the wicked one who becomes a witch when giving the rose, is very badly round, at no time leaves your mouth open. The part that goes to Paris, is a contribution of the film, very well set, but little more. In the end when all the haunted people become people, it does not give you joy, because you have not taken care of them and some go so unnoticed.",3,5,10,26 July 2017
The Shape of Water," The return of Del toro
","It's a good movie. No doubt. The penalty for my taste is that he has done it with a beautiful and familiar whole. It would have been, for my taste better if I had not had that and it would have been drama. The problem is that some scenes would fall as it is made. It is a film in which you have to enter and admit, several aspects of departure, if not, the movie you will not like. If you do not admit it's a family movie, several times you will not believe it. You have to enter your game.I think it's not his best movie but he has come back in a big way.The actors are great. All of them. Sally, who arrived recently, each paper she makes is better than the previous one. Surely this woman has wonders for us in the future.It has a great picture. I liked it a lot. It is almost always pretty, beautiful and supports the story. It helps you a lot to get into the story.The address is again very good. After the faun he fell a lot, but in this he is again the one. Get to the end. You never get bored Get great interpretations. And he knows how to use the camera to tell you the story.

","Le pongo un cinco, porque me cuenta la historia de la otra película y la cuenta bien. Pero en realidad, no me parece nada especial. Creo que es una película que habría pasado desapercibida si no fuese por estar nominada.Para mi James no se merece ni estar nominado. ¿Qué imita muy bien al auténtico? Sí, pero por esa razón, muchos cómicos tendrían un Oscar. El resto del reparto, está igual. Ni bien ni mal.La fotografía cuando están mostrando la otra película no debería ser buena puesto que la otra no lo era. Pero es que no es buena en ningún momento. No aporta nada a la historia y no es bonita.Se ha metido a la dirección ahora, creo que no ha hecho bien. No me gusta como lo hace. No me he aburrido con la película. Pero si no estuviese nominada, no la habría terminado de ver. No sabe poner la cámara.

American Made," It's entertaining, yes, but it stays there
","What do I mean? The moments of Cruise looking at the camera, I get too much of the film, I do not think it is necessary, the story is told alone. The film is entertaining and I have not bored, but when it ends, you stay as it is worth, I know what this man did but I do not care.Cruise is great, as usual. The other actors are very good. That's one of the things that makes you follow the movie.
The voiceover is one of the things that weigh on you, you're already watching the movie, you do not need to tell me twice.Neither is it able to delve into anything, it is also true that it is very difficult, if it lasts two hours, imagine if it deepens. But it does not have that invoice that makes it an extraordinary movieThe photography does not happen to be normal. He does not tell you much, he's not pretty.The address is quite simple. It is true that it entertains. It is not long, except for the moments of looking at the camera, but it is that I should have removed them. The plans are simple, do not narrate or are beautiful.If you feel like knowing what you did, watch the movie. You will entertain",5,0,1,30 December 2017
The Witch," Very good interpretations for a film that did not know where it goes
","Watching this movie, knowing that it is based on legends from those places, I expected to see a scary movie. The pity is that I do not know what I have seen. I have not seen a scary movie or seen a movie of legends, nor have I seen a film of lack of culture, but rather a mixture of everything. For me that is the problem that is not decided by any and joins them all from there the concoction that I do not like. When I was half a movie waiting to see something that scared me, something appeared that was supposed to frighten but disappeared and until then.This film has even badly composed planes, distant planes, with actors on one side and the other side with nothing.The actors are great, everyone can see that there is fear. You see they do not know what's happening. The problem is that they are not afraid. In short, of the culture, I imagine but nothing else, because I have not seen anything that has to be scared until much later and does not enter to tell us any of this.He has a great picture. It's cold as the movie. The place is very well thought out, completely isolated from everything. It is well set with a magnificent wardrobe.I also do not know what the touch of incest is, which does not come to mind and does not lead to anything.The movie is slow. I do not look for scares of sound or anything like that, I do not like them, but if I look for a film that gives me some uncertainty, nervousness, uneasiness and this movie does not give me any of this.Spoiler: In the end he tries to fix things by saying that the daughter is a witch or a witch, but in the whole movie, we have not seen any of this. Only people who are scared of what they do not know and brand it witchcraft.",2,2,4,30 November 2016
Mudbound," Too much voice in off
","I'm watching this movie and I do not think it's a bad movie. The problem is that to me, personally, the voiceover takes me out of the movies. Normally the voice in off is of the protagonist, who tells you his story. The director does not know how to tell it and he does so, which in itself is bad. In this case, it is not that there is a narrator, it is that there are several, which brings me out of the whole, it is not decided by a path but it takes several roads, nothing ends.We see another film of this fashion that has come to make anti-racist movies that of course will be nominated to the Oscars for that very reason. For me, this film would not have to be nominated. It's not a bad movie, but it's not good enough to be nominated, if it's not a year that we've had.The actors are fine, in general they are all credible. Otherwise the film would not stand.It is well set. You think you are at that moment in that place. Makeup and hairdressing help a lot.Photography when it is night, it is too dark. You do not see anything By day it's pretty good. And in the interiors too. Join the story.The director for my taste, does not get to do it well. He does not know with what story to stay. He does not know how to put the camera most of the time, he agrees to make simple plans. But when there is a sequence of action, it escapes from your hands, I explain it in the spoiler zone. It does not get boring, but if the voice tones off.It's a movie that I do not think anyone remembers in a while.Spoiler:When the kkk acts, the director does not know at any time how to direct it. You do not know what happens in no time. You have to wait until the end to see what happened. I do not think he does it because he does not show and not bother, but because he does not know where to put the camera.If there is a moment that makes me happy. When the woman sleeps with the brother-in-law. While it is wrong, I think it will be the only pleasant time in your life with a man.",6,0,6,6 February 2018
12 Years a Slave," Is it possible to leave cold showing how they enslave someone?
","Well, from my point of view, this movie succeeds. I do not know he has the movie, but he does not have the strength. The movie is very cold. It does not manage to transfer the penalty it should transfer. Anyone who sees someone as a whip will tremble, but watching this movie, I do not know if it is that it does not make it credible or has no soul.The fact is that I have finished watching the movie and I am still thinking why the movie has given me equal. I do not care about anything that has happened. I saw in the final part a fact that surprised me for bad, I will explain it in the spoiler.None of the actors seems to me to be wonderful. Neither the bad ones are bad nor the good ones are good or transmit pen.Photography, neither counts, nor is it beautiful.The address as it fails to convey I think it is not necessary to say anything more. But in addition, the planes are simple, does not even know how to compose.I do not really know why this film is nominated because it is not more than a movie like many.Spoiler: When we finally see how the slave and the family are reunited, it is normal that the grandchildren are cold because they did not know their grandfather but why was their daughter cold? Why did I stop looking for his father?",3,4,7,3 January 2017
Sausage Party," Can you be more unpleasant?
","The thing is, the movie, it could have been fine. It has a good rhythm and it deals with interesting subjects, but the problem is that I take for granted that to sell, the beginning and the end, to leave that flavor of the mouth is very bad. To engage certain viewers who like that kind of vocabulary and to remember that this movie says this.Then the rest of the movie, not bad, deals with issues like faith because if, like family, but never deepens.The animated films, has the power of, as it is done with computer, can narrate with a camera that you put where you want, very cheaply, at zero cost. However it is very typical that even so, they do not usually have much ingenuity to do it and this film is an example of it. The address is quite simple.He has a typical animated film picture, neither good nor bad.In spite of being short, to me, personally, I was made long, by the fact of the vocabulary.",4,0,3,20 March 2017
Joker," There is still good cinema
","And I'm glad the truth. I had heard many things about this movie, but for me, they were not right. I think when you start watching it, you know you're watching a good movie. It is seen in each frame that has an air of cinema.I do not know if they will give the Oscar to Joaquin, but I think he is very close to achieving it, although I have not yet seen all the films. The change in all aspects he has in his character is brutal. There is only one thing that I do not like, that blames society for how the character becomes, in addition to saying that it is bad in the head.The lighting is very good, in fact it is one of the things that leads you to believe that you are watching cinema.Although I don't like how he handles the camera, I think the director's job is pretty good. He knows how to maintain the tone and rhythm of the film. Get all the actors are very good. He has made a great movie.The film had the difficult job of making another version of the Joker, after all there is, and it has worked out very well.",7,2,4,19 January 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," But what do you want to tell me?
","I've seen this movie twice. I have done it because I still do not understand what he wants to tell me. All I see is sex and drugs. Does Scorsese really mean to me that this world is just that? Are we still like this? I think I'm not the only person who knows people who work in the bag and they do not seem at all. I have become so bored that the second time I had a hard time seeing it and it becomes eternal.I love DiCaprio and I think it's great, like all the actors. The problem is that they do not know where they are going.I do not like his address, I never liked it and this time it was not going to be less. But this time the photography is not good, at least in the street.The worst thing is that you can not say much more, because the film so little inwardly that you can not criticize much.",3,2,2,16 December 2016
Jaws," This movie is a great filmmaker's
","It is Spielberg in all its essence. It creates restlessness, creates mystery. It has its familiar parts, parts of friendship. It is emotional, well narrated.I take great joy seeing it as I saw the Spielberg I was waiting for. The entire film is designed, designed, composed, in an exceptional way. You can see that I had a wonderful time in the whole process. Even if I had all kinds of problems. Flat to flat you see as you have thought, to compose it stupendously. It has an amazing staging. As it moves the actors inside the plane and how it moves them to give depth of field and to narrate of beautiful form.His wit is seen in planes as when he receives a call and the phone is at eye level and behind things are happening. Or when the woman goes to fire the policeman to the boat. All designed.The actors are great. All are different, all their characters grow. They come to empathize and you believe them.A photograph that being clear, is not video camera, if it does not contribute something.I think this was his first great work, after having had a sea of ​​wonders.",9,4,6,9 February 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Expected less from this movie
","If you're hoping to see another remake of King Kong, I'm sorry, you're not going to see it. The story has nothing to do. Actually it does not count almost anything, but that was to be expected. But if he manages to make you spend some time.It is very difficult that in these films the effects manage to do the animals well, but in this case, they are very well made. Get you to believe them and not get you out of the movie.With the fights, you have entertained. Although it is a little long, but it gets along well.Underneath all, it drops its anti-war message, but this is very typical in American cinema.He has a picture that is not bad. The typical photograph of these films. She is pretty.The plans could have been more spectacular. It would not have cost him much since it's every computer. The director takes the film well, although too long.The pity is that he does not have a great casting. When Jessica Lange was there, you understood the monkey. This woman still has a look that catches you and does not let you go, it's all sensuality. In this case, as he does not follow the same script, he does not have a good casting.",5,1,1,3 September 2017
Arrival," It gives you pleasure when you surprise a movie, even with good expectations
","What am I talking about? When you speak very well of a movie, in the end, it seems worse. I was thinking that it was going to happen to me. But no, I thought it was a great movie. At times he reminded me of Terrence Malick or Stanley Kubrick and I must say that for good, since I am not devoted to them. It's a science fiction movie but with a message. Tardas to catch it, for the assembly that has, but this so well carried, that does not bother you.The picture is too dark, so much so that sometimes you do not see the actors face, but still, it fits the movie very well and helps you tell the story.The effects are obviously very well done. This time it can not be said to be a special effects movie, for bad, but rather the other way around.He has his message pacifist, but it is so well told, that you do not mind the message whether you are a supporter of it or not.It is on the edge between the absurd and the great in many moments, but it is so well carried that it surpasses itself and never falls into the absurd.The truth is that I think the direction is good in some aspects, so I have already told. But I also have to say, I do not know why he makes those planes so ugly many times. Why take the actors by the back or side? They are not seen. But it also has a very bearable pace. Counting all the philosophy that it puts to the film, that is difficult.Although I do not like the voice in the movies, I prefer to be told visually, but I have to say, it is very good. I love the hairdresser, of her, as she can show that she is very aware of the work and does not mind that she is undone what has been done in her hair.It has a very good music, to get me to look at the music during the film, is that they have done well. I got into the movie a lot and helped take the film tempo.",7,0,6,14 February 2017
The Big Short," What a cast of actors, will we see a good result?
","Well I would say that the result is rather scarce. We could talk about the economic part or the film part. As economic, it can not be applied to Europe, since its norms are radically different and can not be applied. Let's leave that part and focus on the film. I think it will be a movie that will pass without pain or glory and will be forgotten soon. It does not tell anything new, just that there was a lot of state intervention, which at this point is like breathing and little else.Spoiler:The first thing I remember when finishing the film, is the drawings that appear several times on the screen. Are we supposed to be talking about serious cinema, right? These things never work, rather they get out of the movie, or at least it happens to me. The second is that it's a good thing I've seen her doubled, because if I had seen her subtitled, my mother would follow her. That scrambled with words and that I know them all and I understand them.I find it a bit long and boring. The actors are fine, although maybe Christian Bale is a little past. I do not like photography at all, and from the direction, we do not even talk, madness, or war, they're offices. If you want to put rhythm, because it does not make a smarter way with staging, than this lacks at all. Makeup and hairdresser, let's say, nothing important, normal.",2,0,0,6 December 2016
Marriage Story," Nominated? Doesn't deserve it
","Actually the movie is good, it's a part, the actors are pretty good. But he doesn't have the movie anymore. He has heard that it is fatal and that you are very bad at the end of the movie, but the truth is that I did not feel bad and I have spoken with divorced and they have not found anything special. It is a simple divorce.They are fine but they are not wonderful either. There are other much better divorce movies.Photography leaves much to be desired. It is independent cinema and it shows.The most interesting thing about the movie is to know how the system works in the US and how the lawyers get it wrong.The work of the director does not seem any wonder. If he tells the story. But he doesn't know how to place the camera or make it interesting. It is still an entertaining movie anymore.Maybe he doesn't win anything in the end, I think that's what should happen.",6,3,11,12 January 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," When does a movie get so old, is it because it really was so good?
","Revisiting movies from years ago, I watch this movie again. As I move forward, I see her getting older and older. Many things in the script that pass them over and are not answered.Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are sublime, for me it's better than her. He has a character that gives much more play and squeezes to the maximum.It is still an action thriller more, yes with two huge actors, but with the passage of only a few years has become very old.I do not know the others but to me the constant use of the foreground and even the actors looking at camera, has taken me much of the film. The management does not seem very good, but the opposite, if it is true that entertains and does not bore, but if you do not realize that it abuses those plans, bad.The picture is quite normal, although at times it is quite good.If it is true that it has a huge setting. Especially the jail and the murderer's house are very well made.Spoiler:The scene where Anthony Hopkins bites the cop, for my taste, is very badly shot, does anyone believe that moment?",3,3,6,7 January 2017
Black Panther," Â¿CÃ³mo se puede nominar esto? How can this be nominated?
","Igual que me queje cuando nominaron a Lady Bird, me quejo este aÃ±o por esta nominaciÃ³n. Pero es que la otra al menos tenÃ­a cosas buenas. En esta pelÃ­cula, es que no se libra nada. Como se puede hacer tan mal una pelÃ­cula. Â¿QuÃ© dirÃ­amos si nominaran a Iron man? Pues lo mismo le pasa a esta pelÃ­cula.Los actores estÃ¡n terribles. No se libra ninguno. Que mal estÃ¡n todos.Los efectos, no pueden ser peores, pero si es que no estÃ¡n integrados ninguno. Los cromas se notan todos.La iluminaciÃ³n es lo Ãºnico que no es malo del todo. Pero que tampoco es para tierra cohetes.El director no sabe por dÃ³nde se mueve. La escenas de lucha iniciales, no hay quien las vea. DespuÃ©s mejora eso sÃ­. Con ese material podrÃ­a rodar espectacular y lo hace muy sencillo.La he terminado de ver para hacer una crÃ­tica en serio. Pero es terrible. Es predecible. El guion es horrible.Just as I complained when they nominated Lady Bird, I complained this year about this nomination. But the other one at least had good things. In this movie, nothing is being waged. How can a movie be made so badly? What would we say if they nominated Iron Man? Well, the same thing happens to this movie.The actors are terrible. No one is spared. How bad they all are.The effects can not be worse, but if none are integrated. Chromas are all noticed.Lighting is the only thing that is not bad at all. But that is not for earth rockets either.The director does not know where he is moving. The initial fight scenes, there is no one to see them. After that, it improves. With that material could shoot spectacular and makes it very simple.I have finished seeing it to make a serious criticism. But it is terrible. It is predictable. The script is horrible.",1,5,8,10 February 2019
Mother!," What a nuisance this camera by this director provokes me
","The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the movie I just saw is that it made me dizzy with the camera. I had to stop looking at the screen twice so I did not get dizzy.The next thing I feel is because there are directors who tell a story they need to resort to telling it in such a strange way. Everyone has his ways of telling stories, it is evident and in fact is the grace of cinema, but when I find directors who resort to such convoluted ways, they saturate me.I think the bottom is counting something quite simple, what an artist suffers to create their stories, but writhes it in such a way that it saturates me. I always thought that when you can remove a movie or put minutes and the movie does not affect you, it is that something bad happens. In this case all the second half of the film, I am convinced that if it was extended or cut twenty minutes, all those who are delighted with it, would still be delighted, but that means it is not well made. In addition it is sometimes even predictable. You know minutes before what happens next.I have many characters left and I do not mean all the extras in the second part. I do not understand the characters of the children or what they want to have with them. I thought I understood Michelle's, but every time I think about it, I get diluted with the film, since I was looking the other way. Bardem, Jennifer and Ed are well, especially her, she is great, telling me that she is not the protagonist in my way of seeing.Nor do I understand why the film leads to a scary movie, when it does not paint the terror in this movie.The photograph would say that it is quite well. Yes that accompanies history, so to speak.But the management, telling me that I still feel dizzy, and that the whole film is shot with the camera in hand, as an easy resource to make you dizzy instead of giving the film that atmosphere and provoke tension in another way. He only knows how to use camera in hand, foreground and move the camera from side to side quickly. I think he's a lot of footage, is too long and I think he has not been able to carry it, he's going to film the film for other issues that do not support anything to the film.I am convinced that the producer has gotten his hand and forced him to shoot another ending, so that at least I have some sense at the end of the film.In short or you will look like a disaster or you will be delighted.",2,10,15,25 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Is the idea of departure credible?
","While I was watching the movie, I could only think one thing, but how can it be against each other? In all the films that are separated, they are the heroes and here they face, I do not see it.For me the film is a total casting error. After Christian Bale and without demeaning Michael Keaton, is the worst Batman in history. On the other hand Christopher Reeve, will be Superman for the rest of his days, there has been no other like. In his two roles he was great and he had the packaging he needed.After 300, Zack Snyder has not returned to direct the same, that film was his masterpiece in all the senses of the direction, in this one it neither knows to place the camera, nor to do entertaining, nor nothing.The worst thing I've ever done is that after Christopher Nolan's Batman, they were great, here we hit a terrible downturn in every way.Spoiler: The truth is that the film has been made, long, long. But for me the worst thing is that the script does not fit anywhere. On the one hand, Batman, has spent fortunes out of his pocket to fight against evil and is an intelligent man, would fight against Superman? Another superhero, who is in a world that is not his own and since he arrived he has only done good. Would you fight Batman? To top it all the Wonder Woman, I had to go to IMDb to know who the character was, I thought it would be bad and suddenly it is another superhero, of which nothing is explained. And of course the last hour to destroy everything and hallucinate with effects.I do not like photography at all, it seems to be a super production, it has a very ugly washed picture.The montage is repeated very much telling us the death of the parents of Batman. There are many slow plans that do not come to mind",3,1,6,30 November 2016
The Greatest Showman," Me dijeron que saldría bailando, pero no. They told me that I would go dancing, but not
","Ha habido películas que viéndolas me he dado cuenta que estaba bailando en el sillón, pero este no es el caso. La canción no tiene el gancho suficiente y es lo más importante de la película. 
Es entretenida, al menos eso si, por eso no la suspendo, pero nada más.
Es una película para pasar el rato, entretenerte, tampoco vas a alucinar con los espectáculos, porque no son la bomba.Los actores, normales, ni más ni menos.Sí que tiene una buena fotografía. Es bonita y agradable.La dirección deja mucho que desear. En este tipo de películas, tendríamos que haber visto unos planos espectaculares que nos habrían deleitado, pero no sabe hacerlo. Solo sabe observar la película. Tiene ritmo, sí, pero tampoco demasiado.Hay películas mucho mejores, que levantan más el ánimo y son más espectaculares.There have been films that watching them I realized that I was dancing in the armchair, but this is not the case. The song does not have enough hook and is the most important thing in the movie.
It's entertaining, at least that's the case, that's why I did not suspend it, but nothing more.
It's a movie to pass the time, entertain you, you're not going to hallucinate with the shows either, because they're not the bomb.The actors, normal, neither more nor less.Yes, he has a good photograph. It's pretty and nice.The address leaves a lot to be desired. In this type of film, we should have seen some spectacular plans that would have delighted us, but do not know how to do it.

Trainspotting," You will hum the song from this moment
","I saw this movie a long time ago. The revisit after seeing the second part. I will never understand why second parties are made knowing that you never improve the first and do not need, but now we are with the first.This is a good movie. Apart from having some moments of not telling anything, the film is very well carried and has great moments. As it explains the monkey moments, or what a drug addict can do for a little drug.The movie starts already strong, the metaphor of the bathroom is spectacular. I can convey to people that we do not use these things, which can become a drug addict.It has great plans, inside the syringe and puts the camera sometimes in spectacular places. At other times, the truth becomes very simple.When it seems that it is going to fall, it goes and rises and continues counting until the end.Although I do not like the voice-over, I use it very well, stopping the image, with what you forgive.He has a photograph that at times is very good, but in others it is very bad. There are moments that you see the spotlights, I do not think you can say that the characters have put them, bone that is made to illuminate, bone very bad.Its direction, without being wonderful is not bad at times. It has nice blueprints. It is very well taken, if it were not for the tourist moment by England.I love it like this Ewan McGregor, he seems like a real junkie. This white, that yes at all times. Which I do not know if it is good. Everyone is great, that's why they have continued to make movies.At all times puts you in that world, has a great atmosphere achieved by art, makeup and hairdressing.And music, from now on, who will not remember this movie when that song sounds?",6,0,3,3 March 2017
Jojo Rabbit," It is not for the Oscars
","Not much less, it's a movie, that you watch it, enjoy it, entertain yourself, and in the end, you feel good and that's it. It has neither the charm, nor the smell, nor the sensation of being watching movies.In no time, you enter the game of being in a Nazi Germany. They have preferred to show them as idiots to show them as what they were and thus they would have given greater force to the children. It is what this type of cinema has. As it does not put you in the skin of some, then you cannot put yourself in the skin of others and enjoy the good things.The kids are great. They are not like other children, they are fine, they do take you with the movie. However, the elders, well, apart from ridiculous, I imagine it is what he wants, but you do not believe them or give you anything. Nor is Scarlett for Oscar, papers like that, there are thousands during the year.I don't deserve any of the nominations.The lighting, surely everyone who has seen it, thought it was at war, or rather, on the beach.The director's job, because apart from the children, the rest is no wonder. If it is true, that the slow motion of the end, was at great risk of being passed and has finished very well, even being too long. The narration with the camera is null and although the tone does not fade, it fails to convey what it should, to my liking.It is a movie, to watch and entertain.",6,3,8,26 January 2020
Son of Saul," Please, I can see something.
","This is a film in which the director has decided to destroy it with his address. It could be a movie since the actors are very well, everyone, well let's say the Jews, because the truth is that those who interpret Germans do not know. It gets so much into the nape of the head that not only do not see many things that happen but if we did not already know the story of what happened, the Nazis would pass almost unnoticed, bone, does not give you the option to see how bad were.It's a shame because the film would be great, it has enough material to make it great. The idea is for everyone to identify but I at least can not get into the movie, with that camera that does not let me see anything.This makes it cold, but not because the photo, which is not a wonder, is, if not because it does not reach you at all. At least it does not transmit anything to me.As I said the address is very bad, the photo, little thing, only save the makeup, the hairdresser and the wardrobe and is that apart from costing a lot of money is quite easy.In short, after a long disappointment",5,4,8,30 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a pleasant surprise
","The truth is I do not like J.J. Abrams. He is a director who does not call me and when I knew he was going to direct, I was disappointed, but when I saw the film, I had a pleasant surprise. Yes, it has the magic of the first three. And not just the magic, it is also well made. Obviously it is not a movie of actors, but still, they are not bad at all. While Oscar Isaac, John Boyega and Adam Driver for me, do not give the casting good.The truth is that it does not look like an Abrams movie, it has nothing to do with its old directions, this one is much better. It has depth of field and staging, like A new hope. Leave behind your little lights and understand very well, the Star Wars. It has rhythm and is well planned. And as Harrison Ford is not splendid.The photo is fine, like art, costumes and makeup.That's right, it's not Star Wars, that's totally why I only put it five. Because although it surprised me, I would see it again before the old ones. It is also true that it is impossible to get Star Wars again, nor does it lack. But if it is true that we re-enjoy the Star Wars universe. Although it is impossible to do again Darth Vader and the bad in this case does not have the same power",5,3,11,30 November 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I'm going to see one of adventures, or I thought that
","Well the fact is that from time to time I have put it at home, even knowing that I did not like the movies, but I feel like watching an adventure movie and I say come on, I'll see the. The problem is that in a while I start to get bored I start to see that I do not like anything like this carried, that does not catch me. It should be a movie with the typical values ​​of friendship, honor, courage, but apart from having great fights and adrenaline rush through your veins. I should create a spirit of wanting to enter the adventure to the end, no matter what I do tomorrow, but when you think that you have to endure this nine hours to see what you think, if it were another movie if but not this one.I had a complete material to create a world at his feet, to do what I wanted, had money to do everything and for my taste has not got almost nothing. I do not think he took advantage of all the material he had. I do not think he took advantage of the spaces he had. The possibilities were immense and it remained in a simple film.The photograph is very well, telling that there is no plane touched by computer and with the means that he can not.But the management does not get me to catch. I do not believe that fascination that adventure movies created for me years ago. Let's not talk about plans. With that material, he only knows how to make airplanes or close-ups. How can you make an adventure film in the foreground? He does not know how to compose plans, he only knows how to make general plans or close-ups.Of course the makeup, the hairdresser and the dressing room is spectacular, but there is a lot of money behind.I will not make the criticisms of the other two because they will be like that, I will only say that I was watching the second part and it seemed that I was filming in Aranjuez, not wanting to disparage Aranjuez and the third I do not know how many endings , But too many. When it seems the end has already come, go on and on and on and on and on and up seven times.Anyway, I must be me, I imagine you will all be against me, I'm sorry, forgive me the fans of these films.",2,2,5,2 January 2017

Surely it became cult, are usually bad films overrated and this will be. I do not like the actors talk to the camera and in this case, clear to be false documentary, so imagine, half a movie talking on camera.The truth is I do not know if someone opens who wants to see these characters do household chores, I'm bored a lot. I have enough to do them myself. But it is that the actors are very bad and the effects, better nor we speak, can not be worse. We can not even rid the wardrobe, because it would have to look like they are real and be seen in disguise.When they are going to make a dinner and they are going to eat them.

We already had the heroes antiheroes but now they must be rude and unpleasant and thus they will get to the most stupendous girl.Well let's not be surprised that kids on the street have no education.In terms of effects is, as not a wonder, except in some cases that falls short, it seems a lie.The picture is pretty good. The direction saved the moments of great 3d as the titles of credit is very normal.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Seeing the background of the film, I love it
","Why I say, seeing the background of the film? Because this movie that is of vampires, I do not really see it as a vampire movie, I see it as a Neil Jordan movie, bone, liberals against no liberals, I'll explain it in spoiler zone. That's why I like this movie. Some struggle for their individual freedom and others struggle not to be what they are. I do not know if many people will say what I'm talking about but it's what I see that shows this movie.The film, is an entertainment production with almost a great deal. Set in many centuries and is very well set. We believe the whole atmosphere.The actors are great. Kirsten Dunst is brutal, what a discovery, for me almost the best part of her career. Tom Cruise, who has already demonstrated how great he is, does it again.He has a very nice picture. Proper and well conditioned. The movie tells us.The address is normal. Entertains. Normal planes, nothing more. But it is well worn.It has a setting, wardrobe and makeup that is very good.What happens is that it does not become a mythical movie. Stay in entertainment.Spoiler:I love the show between the two, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, two ways of being so different, one looks at his individual freedom taken to the extreme and the other can not accept what is almost let himself die. And the confrontation decides with Kirsten Dunst, who a moment comments that why they did not ask if she would always want to be like that, because they decided for her. Can there be a more liberal thinking? Can anyone be opposed to it?",6,0,0,4 January 2017

That they do not count anything else for going in slow motion. They are not even pretty or spectacular.

","I have begun to see her and for a moment I thought I had already seen her. With slight changes, it is identical to the previous one. It's these types of movies that you're not going to see anything new, but everything is the same, it's too much.I have to admit that of course the effects are incredible. Even bugs are believable. It's very difficult to make credible bugs in movies, but it succeeds.He has a spectacular photograph. You can not say otherwise. She's pretty and she's in full. But I constantly think that I have already seen it.I do not know why directors never take advantage to make spectacular plans in this type of films. They would win a lot, but I think they simply do not even raise it.I think it is another of the saga, for lovers of the same",2,2,3,24 September 2017
V for Vendetta," This type of film that defends violence above all else
","I saw it in the cinema years ago, I thought it was very bad and I wanted to see it again to do a review with fresh ideas. I have seen it again and it seems very bad. The reasons, some in zone spoiler and some not.I do not understand how films that defend violence in such a radical way can be so successful.All the actors are very well, well except one that we do not see anything clear.The picture is fine. But the address leaves a little to be desired, it's too simple. The struggles are not well rounded, you can not see anything.Soon I will hear again that video games of violence are bad for children, which I do not agree with, but we do not wonder if telling the children that democracy must be destroyed is not bad.SpoilerFor starters I do not understand why for some things, if you create what interests you but for others not. For example, to tell us the story creates an incredible situation as one of the freer, more cultured, better democracies has become a dictatorship, of course conservative. I could not take it to a country as there are still many with established dictatorships like Cuba, Korea, Venezuela, etc. Or maybe the reason is that I wanted to call the government of the moment, dictator, which is why I choose myself.It creates a second story of the most typical. Since I am not an atheist, priests as always are pedophiles.I am very grateful that the protagonist is watching 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. Do we want to compare a man who fights for his private property in a totally different moment of history with someone who in the 20th century is dedicated to killing people and destroying things that belong to everyone?Then we have Natalie Portman that at first seems, as any person offended by violence, but then when anyone would have been very angry about what makes it happen V and yet he falls in love with him and it is she who bustles the congress .The policeman, who defends the law and at the end let Natalie lower the lever.",1,4,13,3 January 2017
The Godfather," What a great setting, but something else?
","This is one of the mythical films in the history of cinema. As well as Taxi driver, I think it is overrated. If it is true that the film has an impressive setting. That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story.The photography is spectacular, such as art, makeup, costumes, the overall setting is fine. The actors also do very well.The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way.",5,2,5,30 November 2016
