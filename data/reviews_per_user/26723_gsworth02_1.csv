The Ring," Don't believe the hype
","I was actually excited to see this movie based on what just about everyone who had seen it had told me, but the movie just ended up being another example of why American movie-goers have no clue. First off, I thought this movie was supposed to be scary? It wasn't, at all. I never found myself being remotely scared. Second, this movie explains almost nothing. Watch it as many times as you want, most of what happens has no explanation, and the plot has more holes than a block of Boar's Head Swiss Cheese. Maybe 'Ring 2' will clear things up for us... I doubt it.Wanna check out something really different? Watch 'Donnie Darko.'* of ****",1,5,14,12 January 2004
