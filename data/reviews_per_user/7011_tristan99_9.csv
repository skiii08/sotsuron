10 Cloverfield Lane," Thrilling Mystery that will Keep you on Edge
","The first thing I have to say is that the acting in the movie is phenomenal. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr., and John Goodman all did an amazing job in the movie and were perfectly cast. I really love the plot of the film, the setting being an underground shelter and only three people throughout the entire film. It really added to the mood and suspense that is the apocalypse outside. Howard(Goodman) rescues both Michelle (Winstead) and Emmett (Gallagher) and takes them to an underground shelter who both realize after a while that Howard is holding them captive after making unsuccessful attempts to see what is going on outside. The music in this film is also perfectly made adding to the tone. One of the best suspense films in years.",10,0,1,20 April 2017
Alien," One of the best Movies of all time, Period.
","Alien is one of the best movies to have ever been made, hands down. Not only does it combine great suspense with music, but the acting is also amazing. The plot is pretty straightforward, an alien stows away on a spaceship with a mere 7 crew members, and after harvesting itself from Kane, escapes onto the ship and silently picks off the crew one by one. This was one of the very first horror films I ever watched and after watching tons of others, this movie still stands above most for me. Every time I watch it, I always find something new and I never stop being scared. Sigourney Weaver is also one of my favorite actresses of all time. In my opinion, this is a must see for people who love not only horror films, but films in general. Hands down an amazing film.",10,1,2,17 April 2017
Split," Nice Thriller to Kick off 2017!
","I was very pleased with Split, a nice thriller that combined elements of both horror and mystery to pull a very great movie! I loved the idea of having someone with split personalities in a thriller, something I don't think I've seen before so it was a nice and fresh idea for a movie. I've always been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work, so I went into this movie knowing that I would probably like it. I think that James McAvoy was perfectly cast and also rising star Anya Taylor Joy. Anya Taylor Joy's character was a very interesting girl and I really liked her! I like her character development and flashbacks. She was a strong fighter throughout the film and I enjoyed that. I was a huge fan of the personality named Hedwig, I thought he was hilarious. I was afraid at first that I would get lost and confused with all of the personalities, but thankfully the film elaborates on several of them so no confusion happened. Whenever the Beast personality arrived near the end, I was completely hooked on what was going to happen. The ending left the door wide open for a sequel with the revealing of Bruce Willis as David Dunn from Unbreakable, and finishing with a twist. Hope to see a sequel sometime in the future!",8,4,13,14 April 2017
The Shining," Classic Horror at its Finest
","The Shining will always stand out as a classic masterpiece of horror in our culture. I love the plot of the film and the setting of the hotel in the middle of nowhere. Jack Nicholson going crazy is one of the best things you'll see play out on film. I also love the character of Wendy and Danny with his famous signature of 'REDRUM'. The movie is definitely a mind trip at times so many might be confused, but it all makes sense near the end because he was going crazy throughout the movie not only because of the past of the hotel, but also the isolation in the mountains. One of the best adaptations of Stephen King's books.",10,1,3,20 April 2017
The Conjuring 2," Just as Bone-Chilling as the First One
","Usually sequels never live up to the original film, but this film stands out. I thought the Conjuring 2 was just as scary as the first movie and I'm so happy they made it. Although many will miss the setting of the farmhouse, the house in England is turned into a house of horrors that lives up to the original. Based off of the true story of the Enfield Haunting, a family is terrorized by a demon that's set on possessing the daughter. I'm so happy that Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson returned as the Warrens, their acting is breathtaking and I would love to see more of them in the future. I loved that they added the Amityville Haunting in the beginning of the film (which they also investigated in real life) and played off of the end of the first film. Another thing I really loved about the movie, is the other side characters shown in the film, like The Crooked Man and The Nun. They are already making a spin off about The Nun right now and I can't wait to see what it has in store for us. Bottom line is The Conjuring 2 will scare you just as much as the first one and it definitely should be in your Top 10 Scariest Films.",10,1,2,20 April 2017
Get Out," Amazing Thriller, with a necessary theme behind it
","I absolutely love this film! It rolls out a story that many can relate to. Not every parent likes hearing the news that their child is dating someone of a different race, and this movie portrays the struggles and inner turmoil that many interracial couples have to face. Of course, the movie is also a horror film, so there's a deeper story as to why Rose's family acts so weird around Chris. It turns out that Rose has had many African American boyfriends before Chris, and the sole purpose is to lure them in so that the family can harvest their brain to certain attributes that they otherwise could not have. The twist is a great one, while many could've guessed that Rose was involved, the movie plays this twist out to great lengths even adding in some of the household help too. The movie also added some key elements of things we see in society every day, such as when the cop pulled them over near the beginning of the film and ended up interrogating Chris even though he wasn't even driving. I think Jordan Peele's debut into directing went very smoothly and I think this is a must-see for everyone!",10,6,17,16 April 2017
The Mist," Cheesy Horror Film, but Entertaining
","The Mist is a very interesting film that is based off of the genius that is Stephen King. Throughout the movie, I laughed, cried and was grossed out. I loved the idea of the creatures coming through the mist and I loved the setting of the supermarket, which hasn't been seen too much in other scary films. The bugs were kind of nasty, but were played out in the movie in very different ways. They were kind of corny and some of the deaths were just laughable. I also cried at the end, a very sad ending for some of the people after the truth of the mist comes to light. There are many emotions to the film, but it's solid enough entertainment that's worth a watch. I'm also a big fan of Marcia Gay Harden, she is an amazing actress in everything that she's in. Also three future co-stars of the Walking Dead (one of my favorite shows) met on this show, Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn and Melissa McBride.",7,3,4,20 April 2017
Don't Breathe," Very suspenseful film, that will leave you on the edge of your seat!
","Very unsettling film, but that's what makes the movie great! I was on the edge of my seat biting my nails during the whole film. The acting and story were great as well as the thrill of jump scares that will actually make you jump. I love the concept of the blind man being the main antagonist of the film, it's something different that you don't normally see. Another valuable thing for the movie is that you actually care about the characters in the film especially Rocky. I love her backstory and the reason she wants to get the blind mans money (to get her and her sister out of her drug abusing mothers home). Adding to all the suspense, the delinquents also uncover something deeper about the blind man while exploring his basement, and its not very pretty. The ending also leaves the door open for a hopeful sequel. I definitely recommend this movie to horror fans who are ready to tread new ground and finally be scared once again.",9,1,3,16 April 2017
Life," Decent Space Thriller, but nothing too original
","The first time I saw a trailer for this movie, I immediately thought of the movie Alien (which is amazing) and I wasn't really excited to see something that looked nearly the same. The result was what I expected with a few notable exceptions. The alien creature in this film was very interesting and I loved the way it looked and moved around. I like the concept of the Alien getting larger and larger within just a few moments. I squirmed in my seat when the thing crawled inside of Ryan Reynolds character and killed him, that just made me feel uncomfortable but it was quite a thrill. I also love the ending to the film, left me hanging for more and ready for a sequel. Other than the two things I mentioned above, there really isn't anything else original about the film, the astronauts go to another planet, an alien creature tags along with the team, then there is always a scientist trying to stop the team from killing the specimen so he can 'research', who then inevitably gets killed and gets loose in the spaceship to wreak havoc. All very clichÃ© to me. Still not a bad film though, I would check it out but if you're looking for a masterpiece I would check out the film Alien instead.",6,4,9,14 April 2017
