Mission: Impossible III," Mission:Impossible III-The Third Installment
","And this was against sizable odds by the way which gave it a sense that the franchise itself played out and not to mention its star much overexposed,but in all fairness,the third installment to the Mission:Impossible series really delivers the goods and then some in one of the most action packed thrilling roller-coaster ride of the summer. This is largely a result of an expertise television director J.J. Abrams(of 'Alias' and 'Lost') who KNOWS have a stage various action sequences and knows how to keep audiences enthralled from one scene to the next. Abrams raises the tension level to a maximum and also it is a clich√© that will leave your pulse racing for more and more to follow. However,'Mission:Impossible III' makes up for what the other two installments basically missed since Abrams masterfully energized the series by taking a predictable and tired franchise with his signature style and does the impossible which was something the other two directors from the last two films tried to successfully accomplished,but still the last two installments were megamoney makers. Again,Tom Cruise returns as special IMF agent Ethan Hunt who is called back to duty to take on one of the ruthless villains he has every had to face with....a sadistic arms dealer and vengeful psychopath who is played masterfully and wonderfully innovative by best-actor Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman. It is Hoffman by the way that gives this film its sheer brilliance and raises the bar with just his presence along with the rest of the cast with includes Ving Rhames,Jonathan Rhys-Meyers,Billy Crudup,Michelle Monaghan,and Laurence Fishburne as a creepy IMF associate was well chosen indeed.The best moments in the film are just absolutely breathless to begin with,especially the stunts where Cruise's character of Ethan Hunt jumps off a skyscraper and dangles upside down,gets run over by a semi tractor-trailer,and leaps across a 15-foot gap as a bridge is blown apart,not to mention the breathtaking helicopter chase where Hunt is being pursed by Hoffman's ruthless henchman. As far as the love story is concern between Cruise and Monaghan is basically the weakest link but the action sequences and its gritty nerve-racking scene where Hoffman's psychopath is on the scene which includes a a horrific sequence with Cruise,Hoffman,and Monaghan is the the best climatic part yet and more of it follows towards the end where the battle between Hoffman and Cruise really escalates. In other words,this a hip new installment of that has been resurrected to a cool approach and from there Tom Cruise and Company have done it again..taking a old concept and give it a new look. Simply Brilliant.",Null,1,2,5 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Five Stars-A Timeless Classic
","The 20th Anniversary re-issue of Steven Spielburg's 1982 masterpiece features never before seen footage(appreciated)and enhanced visual effects(not so appreciated),but ultimately,these additional bells and whistles neither elevate nor denigrate what was already a near-perfect study of friendship and fantasy as filtered through the eyes of a young boy desperately in need of a companion. Spielburg has made a least three or four films that I would rate higher then E.T.,but in terms of a emotional investment,this one is peerless in his canon,invoking laughter,tears and everything else between as we follow little E.T.'s odyssey to return home(a popular kid flick motif also found in,among others,The Wizard of Oz,Lassie Come Home,The Homecoming of Benji,etc.) Years later,the film still has not lost none of its magical glory and in this new version there is very much to savor;the remarkable performance by Henry Thomas as the alien's soulmate Elliott;the equally impressive turns by Robert McNaughton and 6-year old Drew Barrymore as Elliott's siblings;also included in this new version is a very short cameo appearance by Harrison Ford as Elliott's school principal;the majestic sweeps of one of John Williams' best scores(for which he won the Oscar that year in 1982 for Best Musical Score);Dee Wallace's achingly real performance as the kids' vulnerable single mom(To the question of why Dee Wallace never became a bigger star after the huge success of E.T.and other movies she did after that remains a mystery to this day);PeterCoyote's chilling portrayal as the government agent out to capture the alien and to separate the bonding between E.T. and Elliott is one of the most scariest parts of the movie;and the isolated sequences that were deleted(the bathtub scene,the classroom frogs,Elliott kisses the girl in the science class,the flying bikes,etc.)that will continue to delight moviegoers to generations to come. A Timeless Classic. ***** 5 stars.________________________________________________________________ I had the opportunity to see this film again in its entire format. The last time I saw this was back in the summer of 82'(I was 14 years old in high school)and I only saw about half of it(the original version). It was up against some very stiff competition during that time{Tobe Hooper's 'Poltergeist' which was produced by Steven Spielburg;Harrison Ford in Ridley Scott's futuristic thriller 'Blade Runner',and computer video thriller from Disney called 'Tron';Richard Gere in 'An Officer and a Gentlemen';and Sean Penn in 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High',and one musical 'The Best Little W****house in Texas' with Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton,and Friday the 13th-3D},but in this new version I was very pleased that this one was excellent all around and I truly enjoyed every minute of it.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
Minority Report," File This One Under Masterpiece
","This is the first movie of 2002 that is one of the most breathtaking masterpieces I have ever seen and to put it mildly it is Steven Spielburg's best action flick since 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark',and his most suspenseful since 'Jaws'. Spielburg's talents as a visual storyteller and an excellent script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen(from Phillip K. Dick's short story) is smart enough to throw in little clues in its first hour that the system may not be as perfect as we think it maybe. The story is set 50 years into the future. Tom Cruise is John Anderton,a detective in the pre-crime unit of Washington,D.C. This high-tech law enforcement division uses special psychics to prevent murders before they happen. Max Von Sydow is Cruise's superior who hopes to continue the unit's important work even as a public vote looms on whether to extend federal funding for the project and take it national. Colin Farrell is the government agent assigned to find any weakenesses in the system. I'm not going to give away much of the plot**SPOILERS ALERT*** since the rest of it you have to see it to believe it. Giving John Williams' composing score and Janusz Kaminiski's stunning cimematopgraphy,the result is something that you may have seen based on several Stanley Kubrick flicks,but this one is a grand entertainment that we haven't seen in a good while,and its better than those tiredsome line of lame sequels and pathetic kiddie material. God bless you...... Steven Spielburg.",Null,0,0,12 July 2002
Chinatown," One of the top 100 films of all time
","The year 1974 was very memorable. That year several films were successes which consisted of Francis Coppula's 'The Godfather:Part II',Alan Pakula's political thriller 'The Parallex View',Robert Aldrich's 'The Longest Yard',and not to mention the disaster epics of the day;Irwin Allen's 'The Towering Inferno',and Mark Robson's 'Earthquake' not to mention the films 'The Conversation',and 'The Great Gatsby','Lenny',and 'Blazing Saddles' to name a few. But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI's 100 top films of all time.The year was 1974. The motion picture is 'Chinatown'. This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970's. This was the movie that started it all.Jack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70's directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne's Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940's Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film's alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. 'Chinatown' was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970's was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.The film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",Null,90,162,6 August 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest
","It would seemed like of ludricious to eventually think that Disney would have made a sequel to one of the biggest hits of 2003...the monster hit 'Pirates Of The Caribbean:Curse Of The Black Pearl'. The first installment was a runaway hit and huge box office success giving Johnny Depp an Oscar nomination for his impressive work as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Well,it's three years later and all of the original cast that were in the first installment are definely back again in the second installment of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest'. Again,director Gore Verbinski returns along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and supporting cast Keira Knightley and, Orlando Bloom for another round of high adventure and breathtaking excitement. Unfortunably,in the wake of the first film's huge success,this is almost sinks deep into the abyss of film failure,but in all this one is most cartoonish than the original film from 2003 which was very difficult to achieve. The second installment of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest',often feels like a live-action version of Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote extravaganza and on the other hand feels like a live-action version of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd with a hint of Daffy Duck thrown in for grand measure. These moments are the funniest-liveiest parts here while the rest of the material is just bloated and as for the rest of the material it is brilliant in the special effects area along with some excellent scenes involving the bad guys-a creepy,crawly crew of half-humans,half-crustaceans,not to mention a showdown with a enormous multi-tentacled leviathan-a monstrous squid that really is sort of a tribute to the earlier Disney films,especially Richard Fleischer's 1954 version of Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea'.The first one was absolutely brilliant,but the sequel to this one is kind of a disappointment especially with some of the performances here. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is watered down in parts but the rest of it is okay if not concern with some of the scarier scenes and cliffhanging action sequences which may confuse younger audiences. Be aware that the film has a rating of 'PG-13'. In the second movie,because of Jack's blood debt to the feared pirate Davey Jones,Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley),and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom)must join the quirky captain once more and defeat a series of supernatural villains who want Jack's soul. However,if Captain Jack finds the treasure chest to Davey Jones' locker,and if he can control Jones,then Sparrow can avoid being his eternal slave. If not,he'll will be doom to life in eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife. Anyway,the characters travel to exotic islands,dirty pirate hangouts,and come face to face with other characters that are more frightening than those in the first movie. However,the performances are okay,but still letting Depp take control of the lead,the movie pays more attention to Knightley than in the first film,especially in the action sequences where she hold her own. As for Bloom and Depp the characters are more in focus are more entertaining here. The rest of it was spectacular,especially with the computer-generated action and astounding special effects. However,there is a chase scene that drags on endlessly and that was tiring at times. The movie is way too long. At over 150 minutes at length it gets boring with some of the material with some of it as no-stop action in between. But in perspective,'Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest',which by the way ends in a cliffhanger to set up for the next and final installment of the series,which hits theatres around Memorial Day of 2007. But still nothing can stop this film for becoming one of the biggest hits of the summer. And again,we can thank Johnny Depp for that.",Null,0,1,13 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Blows Other Summer Out Of The Water...The Best of 2003
","My first experience with pirates was turning on the TV one weekend afternoon when I was little and watching a classic Errol Flynn flick called 'Captain Blood'. This was very exciting to watch and it held my interest throughout the picture. Basically that wasn't the first time I was interested in pirates. Pirates have been scene in movies and TV shows for years,and the shows I can recall were shows based on Saturday morning cartoons and those thrilling Saturday afternoon matinees that were shown from the 30's and 40's on television,if there wasn't anything else to do. Basically,the last 'pirate' movie that was okay,but did it every suck was the overrated Geena Davis vehicle called 'Cutthroat Island',and from then on I really lost interest in the pirate genre and so did Hollywood for a while.Until now.........................'Pirates Of The Caribbean:The Curse Of The Black Pearl',maybe the best the finest pirate movie to ever grace the screen,and it is done in the grand tradition of those classic pirate movies of the past and it also goes back to those classic standard Disney fare that hasn't been seen in ages,and if Walt Disney himself were living today,he would be proud. This film is the first ever 'PG13' rated feature under the family friendly/family oriented Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and it its one of the biggest thrill rides of the summer.It has everything you expect in a grand adventure/action packed flick: action,intrigue,romance,humor--all on a grand epic scale that is not to be missed! It's full of old-fashioned thrills and spills. It has classic Hollywood glamour as well---not since the likes of Errol Flynn- men sporting pencil-thin mustaches and women wearing tight corsets,not to mention fantastic special effects all around courtesy of the full advantage of 21st Century cutting edge technology that gives it the marvelous touch,thanks to the crew at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic along with that special Disney touch.Best of all,the filmmakers didn't shy away from putting all of the elements to make this a damn good flick,in other words, to make a pirate movie,a pirate movie and to stand out like a pirate movie. People walking the plank, Pirates grabbing ropes and swinging onto other ships,Pirates searching for buried treasure and others including a pirate who has a talking parrot on his shoulder,and another one with a glass eye and another one that yells out....'Aaargh'!As far as the acting goes,this film belongs to Johnny Depp. It is the reason to go see it. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime looking like the smidgens of classic actors Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks,Jr. 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' is a terrific and satisfying popcorn picture that aims to please and has per se,kicked out the summer competition of 2003 at the box office.The scariest scene but also the best FX scene in the whole movie: When Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) and his crew transformed into walking undead skeletons in the moonlight---this is surely Oscar material here,and I'm so glad that Ray Harryhausen is still alive to see this movie! This scene is scary and maybe too intense for the younger ones.",Null,0,1,29 August 2003
Spider-Man 2," In One Word.....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!
","This is one sequel that is better than the original and then some. Every so often you have a sequel that improves on the outstanding original,and this one is sum up in one word....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! 'Spider-Man 2' is really that good and is a spectacle beyond belief,but the special effects and action scenes are some of the biggest thrills of the summer and believe me this sequel is positively true to the comic book format and it doesn't disappoint the biggest of all Spidey fans out there including yours truly who was fascinated by the ultimate thrill ride of the summer season and everything you could asked for---all in one picture. Our web-slinging hero meets his most adverse archnemesis yet,who claims to be a mad scientist named Dr. Otto Octavious or Doctor Octopus who also claims to have the power of the sun in the palm of his hand while terrorizing the citizens of New York City(played brilliantly by Alfred Molina). By the time his scheme goes haywire,the sun-screen factor New York City and toward a certain doom needs approaches infinity where the transformation of student Peter Parker/Spider-Man is there to depose of the villain against impossible odds and to save the city from a certain fate is again perfectly played by Tobey Maguire.Director of the first 'Spider-Man',Sam Raimi is again at the helm of the second installment to one of the biggest box-office blockbusters of 2002,is working a screenplay by Tony winning and Oscar winning veteran Alvin Sargent(of 'Ordinary People','Nuts')with a story by Micheal Chambon. They expertly modulate the action by juggling personal introspections with some amazing spectacular action-influenced showstoppers that haven't been seen since the first two 'Superman' movies with Christopher Reeve and also since the first two 'X-Men' films as well. This sequel is well worth the wait and I can't wait for the third installment which hit theatres in 2007.",Null,0,0,3 July 2004
Superbad," The raunchiest teen movie yet and it lives up to the title
","Words can't express how happy I am that 'Superbad' exists. The first time I saw it left me with a wide smile grinning from ear to ear after I walked out the theatre. Probably the best thing to come along all summer. 'Superbad' is another comedy that comes to us courtesy of Judd Apatow,the director of 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin',and 'Knocked Up',the other great comedy of the summer of 2007. He was also behind the successful 'Talladega Nights',last summer's comedy smash starring Will Ferrell. This time around Apatow only produces the film;the movie is expertly directed by Greg Mottola,who helmed many episodes of Apatow's short-lived Fox sitcom, 'Undeclared'. The real reason why the film 'Superbad' has an 'R' rating? Where 'Knocked Up'(which was also 'R' rated) was sweet and occasionally profane,'Superbad' is raging dirty and persistently foul mouthed and this was why this film is full of it including some strong language,not to mention scenes of heavy drinking and some graphic content and sexual references-all involving teens. Written by 'Knocked' star Seth Rogen and his buddy Evan Goldberg,this was a movie that basically captures all the awkwardness of the teenage experience,and yet still manages to be as screwball and hyper-exaggerated as a Mad magazine layout. However,director Greg Mottola is visiting familiar territory here which is the high school hijinks movies which has been a staple of other teen-oriented movies from 'American Graffiti' to 'American Pie'.Here everyone is reliable and the situations rarely feel strained which makes 'Superbad' a cut above every other teen farce film you'll see this year and is above most of the teen-oriented movies that I have seen not to mention one of the funniest high school movies since the original 'Porky's' and to an lesser extent 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High'(or to an lesser extent 'Superbad' pays homage to those teen comedies from the 1980's and 1990's). 'Superbad' is both upfront and deceptive. The movie's raunch factor is so high and in-your-face that the gags depicted are too intense,but it helps with the hilariousness that ensumes. But there's more meaningful issues and amid the potty humor and outlandish sex jokes concerning female body parts. But it also delves with the joys of growing up as well and facing the prospects of adulthood. But let's not forget,the movie is flat out funny as all get out. But there are also some scenes that are as just as hilarious as they get and you'll be laughing out loud at some of the mischief these kids get into just to be in the crowd and crash the party and not to mention getting next to the hottie of their dreams. A smart as hell not to mention extreme vulgar,sidesplittingly funny that is one of the most enjoyable I had in ages and just to let you know this film has scenes of drug usuge too all involving teens. The funniest film you'll will see all year.",Null,1,7,24 August 2007
Insomnia," Worth losing sleep for the thrill ride of the summer
","Most moviegoers blast or criticized actors for sleepwalking through their roles,but that's exactly what makes Al Pacino's turn as a L.A. cop who's sleepless in Alaska so eye opening. In this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same title,you can't keep your peepers off the battered Pacino who is investigating the brutal murder of a teenage girl. The problem is,he can't focus on the crime(or his other problems) because he's kept awake at night in a state that has six continous hours of daylight(the always-sunny Arctic summer). His tortured moodiness is intensified by Robin Williams(successfully wielding his dark side and one of the most chilling character portrayals of his career),who could be the murderer and messes with Pacino's already scrambled marbles. All the while,bright-eyed local law enforcement gal Hillary Swank,is about to get to the bottom of everything including in finding out who the culprit is. Luckily,suspense maestro and director Christopher Nolan(Memento) keeps his wits about him to draw out a very deliberate,stylish and precise game of psychological thrills that'll keep your head spinning and your eyes squinting until the end. So far,it is the best reason to stay awake in theater for the thrill ride of the summer.",Null,0,0,5 June 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Roland Emmerich is NO Irwin Allen........
","If our former Vice President Al Gore made a science fiction movie to warn the dangers of global warming,would it resemble this climatological super-spectacle by Roland Emmerich,the director of such summer blockbusters as 'Independence Day','Godzilla',and 'The Patriot'? Probably not,but lets face facts here:Roland Emmerich is NO Irwin Allen whom was better at disaster related flicks then this spectacle of disaster strikes without warning as part of the biggest hokem of the summer and then some since this film was released during the Memorial Day weekend of 2004,and as of this commentary its still is in theatres! There is about one part-relevant science fiction to one part disaster movie hokum in Emmerich's effort,which envisions a new ice age descending on the earth in a little over a week after the eruption of a bizarre super storm in the northern hemisphere with horrifying results.Here we have Dennis Quaid as the obligatory earnest scientist,the movie is as at once essentially silly and genially effective in delivering the popcorn thrills and special-effects mayhem(which is the main part of the film that is the best part). The most memorable features include the storm's spectacular decimation of New York,and a right wing U.S. Vice President who is a ringer for Dick Cheney who gets to lead America's evacuation into of all places--Mexico. And since the events of 9/11,has America had its fascination with things that become destroyed since we fantasized about this at the movies? Of course because we go and see it,and then went it happens then what in heavens name in the hell do we do next? Something to think about when we see events like this hoping that the unexpected doesn't happened.",Null,0,1,29 July 2004
X-Men," Off The Hook!!!!
","Not since the days of Christopher Reeve(Superman),or Micheal Keaton(from the first two Batman films),there hasn't been a movie that rocks non-stop from start to finish,and here its the blockbuster/rollercoaster ride of the summer,and its one of those pictures that gives you the bang for the buck. Based on the Marvel Comics Book,it combines great special effects(the best I've seen this year)with a great plot that gives it one of the best cimematic experience that you will see at the movies. When Wolverine(Hugh Jackman),and Storm (Halle Berry)came out,the audience went completely crazy,and it was one of those films were the audience was cheering them on to take out the bad guys. The part that scared me was Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos),and it was one of those characters that you'll never know what to expect from her,since she changes colors like a chameleon,or a person,at any given moment. It stayed very true to the comic strip,which I've thought it wasn't,but with all the excitement,you just can't take your eyes off it...really,it was just that good and off the hook too!!!Great chemistry between Patrick Stewart(Professor Xavier),and Ian McKellen(Magento),and solid performances from Anna Paquin (Rogue),and Famke Janessen(Jean Grey)...................Great action of the summer flick all the way,and there should be a sequel to this as well.

Knocked Up," The laugh track of a generation with the most refreshing film of 2007
","Looking at the big names in comedy,its clear that those who do the best work oftentimes serve as the voice of there generations. In the 1960's and 1970's,it was Woody Allen that defined his epoch. And during the 60's and 70's you have also on that same roster great comedical directors like Robert Altman,Blake Edwards,and Mel Brooks. In the 1980's,John Hughes best represented what it meant to be young and dissatisfied in suburban America. During that same decade you have also Amy Heckerling who represented the teenage youth of that time. Also for boarder perspective,you have John Landis and David Zucker. The 90's is a little tougher to pin,but let's go with Nora Ephron the writer/director responsible for three of the most influential comedies of the last 20 years: 'When Harry Met Sally','Sleepless In Seattle',and 'You've Got Mail'. Not to mention others who made their mark in the 90's as well. In this decade of the 2000's we found someone as a voice of our own:Judd Apatow. There's little evidence to suggest he isn't the one man in America that can make everyone laugh.As a director,he gave us 'The 40 Year Old Virgin',and some of the best TV shows ever to get the axe(the short-lived TV shows 'Undeclared',and 'Freaks and Geeks'),and its with that pedigree in mind that one approaches Apatow's latest endeavor 'Knocked Up' with sky-high expectations as one of the funniest movies ever to come out of 2007. Rest assured because this film is every bit as hilarious as you'd expect. And while it doesn't top 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'-honestly,what could?-it's indicative of maturation in Apatow's style of comedy that is repulsive funny at ever turn. While 'Knocked Up' is an adult comedy with a youthful spirit and that what's keeps the film,only Apatow's second directorial effect is raw,and persistingly funny. A perfect retreat from the summer norm of tiredless sequels and silly kiddie films. 'Knocked Up' is a combination of 'When Harry Met Sally' for a generation raised by the Trojan man mixed in with ever clich√© of films dealing with losers trying to score with the town hottie while intoxicated on substances. Apatow has crafted a enjoyable film made with adults in mind because he knows how to relay a love story without overwhelming his audience with sentimentality and this is what makes this film a bonafide winner.",Null,0,7,8 June 2007
Alien," The Silver Anniversary of an grand science fiction classic-fully restored and remastered for today's audiences
","Is Director Ridley Scott's 1979 pop blockbuster a science fiction flick or a horror film? It is,of course a uniquely successful and ingeniously arty fusion of the two genres,one that really changed the face of high-tech Hollywood dread and launched a series of top-grossing sequels that started off with James Cameron's 'Aliens'(1986),and the two other installments,'Alien 3'(1992),and 'Alien Resurrection'(1997). This was basically a haunted house movie in outer space,the interstellar fright fest that started a trend toward futuristic grunge that shocked its audiences more than 25 years ago,and one of the scariest films of its era.It also introduced an extraordinarily and scary silmy monster that gave its audiences a good shock out of their seats and gave a lot of them some very frightening nightmares. Not since William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' has a movie been so addictive in giving its audiences major chills,especially within the boundaries of science fiction itself. Add in actress Sigourney Weaver's career-launching performance,and you have a grand classic modern-day science fiction shocker that is well worth the revisit considering the scenes regarding actors Harry Dean-Stanton, Tom Skerritt,Yaphet Kotto,and Veronica Cartwright. The re-release is worth seeing,indeed,especially with the newly restored footage that adds in additional scenes,a remixed digital sound and also tighter editing.",Null,0,1,7 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," George Lucas' Empire Strikes Back in grand fashion!
","SPOILERS I just got back from seeing it and I've got to say that this one rocks! This is a huge improvement from the last Star Wars outing 'Phantom Menace',and a far better display of character development and the best action/sci-fi sequences since Lucas' three original Star Wars trilogies.Yes,ladies and gentlemen...STAR WARS IS BACK IN FULL FORCE!!!'Episode II:Attack of the Clones' has all of the excellent,at least great and astounding things that I liked in the film,and could had some things that could have been better. Overall,it will be the thrill ride of the summer.George Lucas takes several risks with this lastest installment,and the one that pays off the biggest is the structuring much of the first two-thirds of the film as a classic mystery. We think we know all of the answers because we have seen only the last three episodes of the six-part space saga.  Half of the fun of Episode II is figuring out who's who,what their relationship to each other is,what their motives are,and what part will they play in bringing about the downfall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. Lucas has come much closer to hitting the precise target with this one,but in all he had made up for his mistakes in the last outing and on this one its a much more mature and very 'intense' film that will pleased purists and newbies alike.As far as the love story between Senator Padme and Anakin it could have been better since Lucas is voyaging into new territory here. And it shows. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are astounding actors and their characters are physically attracted to one another,but overall it was a bit corny. Some of the scenes are fine,but if I were Lucas I could have gotten Lawrence Kazdan instead of Jonathan Hales to redo some of the dialogue.As for the villains here,Christopher Lee AND Ian McDiarmand were FAR BETTER and more sinister too than that lame Darth Maul from Episode I. But the scene that had audiences cheering for here is no one than man Yoda. For anyone who loved Yoda,this is te movie to see! Here Yoda,walks,Yoda talks,and Yoda KICKS BUTT! He has two of the best scenes in this film--the one where he is gentle(a touching scene where we see him as a teacher of young padawans-Jedis in training),and the other(which will always be my favorite part)fierce as he battle the sinister Count Dooku(Christopher Lee) in a attempt to save Obi-Wan and Anakin from great danger.Long live Master Yoda....his Green Badness of the force!At the end of the movie,Padme and Anakin are married on the planet Naboo with C3PO and R2D2 looking on,but also you can tell where the movie will picked up in the next installment(Episode III),but they showed where his hand was cut off dueling with Count Dooku,and this is where the foundation of Darth Vader and the evil turn of Anakin will come in. Also it furthers the rise of the Sith into controlling the galaxy and it will give us a taste of what the Clone wars will be all about.Overall,this was sci-fi and its finest and I can't wait for Episode III. Some of the characters do get a chance to show their stuff here....For one,Natalie Portman gets to KICK BUTT here and a far better character upgrade than her last go-a-round from the first installment. She shows her tender side,her romantic side, and her fighting side. As for Ewan McGregor's character as Obi-Wan,(who looks and sounds like Alec Guinness)he has never been better. One scene has Obi-Wan dispatched to a distant water planet(which is incredible to see,an amazing effect!!!) to get to the bottom of things,has a showdown with bounty hunter Jongo Fett(Temuera Morrison).Samuel L. Jackson's character Mace Windu has a much larger role here. The film's climax brings it all of these characters together beautifully in a gigantic,eye-popping battle royale on the remote,Mars-like planet of Geonosis.Overall,you have lightsabers,giant monsters,fantastic cities and even a alien diner thrown in for good measure.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Brilliant detail from the classic book that is brought to life
","Released around Christmas of 2001,this was without a doubt the first installment of the classic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien that is brought to life. 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS:THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING'(New Line Cimema,2001) is very 'enthralling','true-to-the-book' retelling of Tolkien's classic epic,'transcends the genre',and 'sets the benchmark for fantasy films to come',with its 'lovely crafted' visualization of Middle Earth is brought to life thanks to its director Peter Jackson and its stars which consist of actors Elijah Wood,Ian McKellen,Sean Astin,Viggo Mortensen,Liv Tyler and Christopher Lee. At somewhat over three hours long of brilliant bliss this is one 'exhilaratingly' perfect upscale entertainment that is an eyepopping spectacle from the start,especially with the extended scenes in the special edition version.It's sequel? 'LORD OF THE RINGS:THE TWO TOWERS'(New Line Cimema,2002) is even more testosterone and more gripping detail in this second installment of the Tolkien trilogy where it starts right off where the first one ended which runs at three hours in length. There is more flawless special effects,spectacular epic battles,and evil villains bent on destruction all within an amazing storyline which sets up for the film's final trilogy which hits theatres in Christmas of 2003,with 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'.",Null,0,0,10 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The Return of Arnold
","The latest installment in the apocalyptic adventures of Arnold Scwarzenegger's rampaging cyborg-from the future may not have the striking originality of the original film,but considering how dismal many sequels and other cartoony action flicks are these days,its decent enough,a well-tooled thrill machine that actually contains a few ideas. By the way,it has been over 11 years since T2:Judgment Day,which in some aspects was the greatest sequel ever made,and it has been over 20 years since the first Terminator flick. Creator James Cameron has been replaced by Jonathan Mostow,who,perhaps awed the by the legend he's been assigned,turns in a work that's mainly self-effacing and serviceable,and it with a lot of new out of this world special effects here since James Cameron here is producing and also wrote the screenplay,along with counterpart Gale Anne Hurd,who also produced the last two Terminator flicks. The action here is non-stop from the get-go,and its worth the admission to the thrill ride of the summer. However,the character of John Connor(played by Nick Stahl)should have been a lot tougher against the lethal android,since he suppose to be the leader of the resistance and here he is acting like a pure punk here and he should have kick ass. Come on,Linda Hamliton in the first two movies really kicked butt!!! But in all pure escapism and the female android is very menacing here who is finishing off the human race. And as for Arnold,he looks like the punk fashion of yore from the golden age of the 80's,than the future governor of California,and also for a change he is really showing his age too,but that doesn't stop him from taking out the baddies. The next installment will be sometime in either 10 years from now,if James Cameron returns to direct.",Null,0,0,10 July 2003
Doctor Zhivago," David Lean's Doctor Zhivago
","Though it doesn't equal his 1962 Oscar-winning epic 'Lawrence Of Arabia',David Lean's epic wartime romance may be his most accessible film. It tells a simple love story in a complex setting,and for the most part,avoids easy resolutions to messy emotional relationships. Even though the focus is squarely on those relationships,everything in the film revolves around the Russian Revolution. The vagaries of both World War I and the prolonged struggles among the various Bolshevik factions are the driving forces behind the plot.In adapting Boris Pasternak's novel to the screen,writer Robert Bolt tells the story in flashback,with the powerful General Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness)questioning a teenaged girl(Rita Tushingham)about her past. He thinks she might be the daughter of his brother Yuri(Omar Sharif)and Lara(Julie Christie). Flashback to their youth and the first time that Yuri and Lara's paths cross on a streetcar. He's promising,prosperous medical student and poet,engaged to his childhood sweetheart Tonya(Geraldine Chaplin). Lara is the daughter of a dressmaker who has a long-term 'arrangement' with Komarovsky(Rod Steiger),a well-connected lawyer who understands the political changes that are coming. Lara's fianc√© Pasha(Tom Courtenay) is an idealistic revolutionary who is part of that change. Komarovsky's interest in Lara is not platonic. As those relationships are being sorted out,protesters are marching in the streets and the Czar's troops are taking them seriously. In the first big confrontation between a demonstration and a cavalry charge on snow-covered streets,Lean avoids the inevitable comparisons to Eisenstein's Odessa steps scene in 'Battleship Potemkin',but he can't help but make a few references to it. The clash in the streets also serves as a counterpoint to Komarovsky's seduction of Lara,and the two elements are deftly interwoven. The combination of the personal life and the political has seldom been so seamless or effective as it is in that long sequence. The most memorable scenes,however,take place during World War I and the revolution:a mass of deserters meets a mass of replacement troops on a lonely road;Yuri and family embark on a long grim rail journey from Moscow to the Urals and negotiate territory controlled at times Red Guards and at times by White Guards;a machine gun attack on an unseen ememy across a field;Yuri being dragooned into service and then his long trek back home through the snow.The Cold War being what it was in 1965(the time this film was released around Christmas of that year),Lean was denied permission to make the film in the Soviet Union,but locations in Spain,Finland,and Canada were more adequate substitutes. They give the film an impression of stark,beautiful expanse. Lean's canvas is the full-width Panavision screen. He and cimematopgrapher Freddie Young(who won the Oscar for his impressive work)along with Nicolas Roeg use all of it in both interior and exterior scenes. Instead of seeing this film on a tape or disc(DVD),the best way to experience seeing this movie in its entirely is in a theater on a widescreen in its original 70MM format. Ignore the pan and scan editions. Other the other hand,some of Lean's devices-the use of mirrors and windows,lightning are fascinating. Like in all love stories depends on viewers' involvement with the characters,and this what makes the film stand out beautifully. The two leads are attractive with exceptional performances from Omar Sharif,Julie Christie,and Geraldine Chaplin. Tom Courtenay was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar,but Rod Steiger's Komarovsky is indelible archetypal survivor. Oscar winning as well for Maurice Jarre's breathtaking score. The theme song from Doctor Zhivago,'Somewhere My Love',was a top-ten hit in 1965. Remains one of the most ambitious and watchable of the big 'Panavision' films of the 1960's,and one that is also gives us the best depictions of a civil war and the terrible human lives it costs.",Null,6,10,1 September 2006
Apocalypse Now," A classic piece of American Cimema
","With the restored version of Apocalypse Now:Redux now being reissued back into theatres,this was in my opinion the last great piece of American cimema in existence today. However, Francis Ford Coppula's Vietnam-set adaption of Joesph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness' returns bearing nearly 50 minutes that was unseen in the original 1979 version. Though Coppula has called this version of it definitive because it is more accurately seen as a very interesting alternate version that lacks the sharp asthetic focus of the superior earlier cut(although its original running time was at 153 mins,this one is more outgoing at over three hours in length). Among the newly seen sequences which include the fascinating 25 minute 'French Plantation scene' seems to radiate the right-wing views of primary screenwriter John Milius. Whatever you make of these and other revelations about what you may think about it,the film itself remains a one-of-a-kind marvel that's easily impressive today as it was two decades ago. Aside from the narcissism of Marlon Brando's climax-destroying performance, Coppula was blessed in having collaborators as brilliant as cimematopgrapher Vittorio Storaro,production designer Dean Tavoularis, sound designer Walter Murch,along with actors Martin Sheen,Harrison Ford,Fredrick Forrest, Robert Duvall,Lawrence Fishburne,and Dennis Hopper as well as Sam Bottoms. A classic piece of American cimema that needs to be seen again that goes beyond the horrowing cruelties of war.",Null,0,0,30 August 2001
Spider-Man," Unbelievable
","I had the grand opportunity to see a special private screening of this eagerly anticipated movie and I must say I was definitely impressed and I was in total awe. Not since the last superhero movie I saw was there a more and clear and complete followup to the comic book and this one was totally it which had me on the edge of my seat and hanging on for more. 'Spider-Man' is a grand transition to what a comic book hero supposed to be and for a good reason. It sticks to detail and while it does that it keeps its audience hanging on for more and then some. The acting of the cast was very,very good and for Tobey Maguire's performance as the teen stud Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best characterization I've seen in a long time since the days of Christopher Reeve(who was the last good actor to play a superhero and to be true to the comic book format).As for the story itself,it kept its pace with the origins of the story and the comic book itself was right on precise target. As for the villain,actor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading lady,Kristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secret,but she knows who he is. As the good point of interest,the movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday mornings,then this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summer,since this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!NOTE: There will be two more installments to the Spider-Man trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus, Venom,and Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all......

The Exorcist," The 30th Anniversary of one of the all-time greats
","More so than Alfred Hitchock's 'Psycho',more so than Roman Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby',William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' expanded the limits of what was acceptable terrain for a commercial horror film. This classic shocker of the supernatural,and one of the scariest films of all time,which notoriously contains a sense of a demonically possessed 12 year-old girl masturbating with a crucfix,shocked critics and even frightened its audiences when it was released more than thirty years ago. When it was released in 1973,there were reports of people fainting or succumbing to hysterics. Movie theater operators confided that they were standing by with paper bags and kitty litter for the piles of vomit in the aisles. Also,some even ran for their very lives out of the theatre and movie operators had to even call in the local law enforcement to calm down individuals who were out of control. It's ver hard to see or even imagine today's audiences having such visceral reactions to a current films such as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre','Jaws', 'Halloween','Friday The 13th,'Alien','A Nightmare on Elm Street',and 'The Omen',to name a few. As extreme as the reactions were,audiences couldn't get enough of it making it one of the top ten films of 1973 and one of the highest grossing picture of its day beside boxoffice contenders of that year were 'The Sting','Enter The Dragon','American Graffiti','Serpico',and 'The Way We Were' all were released in 1973.It also beat out its competition for the highest grossing film as well,dethroning Francis Ford Coppula's 1972 crime epic 'The Godfather',and Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster epic 'The Poseidon Adventure' to reign supreme as one of the highest grossing horror films of all time,until 1975's 'Jaws',dethroned 'The Exorcist' off the top spot. But in this case,the outrage that cause a political and social debate over this picture mabye seems quaint today,but in the 30 years since William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' scared the bejesus out of everyone,we've inmbibed so many violent movies that it is very hard to be shocked since advance technological achievements in filmmaking his come along. While moralists and psychologists may debate the effects of this progressive desensitization,the passage of time does have one benefit,it is easier to evaluate 'The Exorcist' on other terms rather than its shock value. Even after all those years,Linda Blair's character of Reagan will give some individuals nightmares that will haunt them for the rest of their natural lives.",Null,4,6,15 November 2003
Batman Begins," The reconstruction of a beloved franchise that is the thrill ride of the summer. Masterfully restored and executed by Chrisopher Nolan
","For those who may know how the origins of how Bruce Wayne became to be as 'Batman',here are some synopsis of how it really began. For one he witness the brutal murder of his parents when he was young boy and from there he went on to become a one-man vigilante taken on those who do mortally wrong and from there seek revenge on the murder of his parents. He is the eyes of justice and the protector of the innocent and for one was also known as the Caped Crusader,as well as The Dark Knight. Since the origins of 'Batman',which was created by Bob Kane in 1939,the franchise has gone from the days of the comic books to a fifteen chapter movie serial in the 1940's,to the campy TV show of the 1960's, to the last two big-screen adaptions of the late 1990's,The Dark Knight has been anything but dark. For one he's been eclipsed by his enemies,made bland by studio decision-makers and afflicted with a too-suave attitude that made him seem more than nothing more like James Bond with a utility belt. From the first two 'Batman', films that came out during the late 1980's and early 1990's that were directed by Tim Burton,'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' were very successfully until the onslaught on the last two installments of the series since the franchise downhill which at the time never recovered which were directed by Joel Schumacher whose last two films 'Batman Forever' and the loud unnecessary and dreadful 'Batman and Robin',killed it sending the franchise into a eight-year hiatus never to be heard from again. From the lead actors that played the Dark Knight from Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer not to mention George Clooney were optional to played the role but only in my opinion the only actor who portrayed the Caped Crusader that really made the character stand out was Michael Keaton who gave it is style and substance to the role,and from there after the last 'Batman' film directed by Burton,it started out turning from brooding and fantastic and then turned to campy,pathetic and stupid,which in fact turn 'Batman' fans away. Not to mention lame sidekicks,and outlandish villains also killed it too. Until now.'Batman Begins',directed by Christopher Nolan('Memento','Insomnia')has given the franchise a needed boost and does it ever succeed its objective. What Nolan has done here was restored and refreshen one of the most lucrative comic-book franchises in motion picture history and its a very far cry from the previous installments which killed it especially the last installment that was made in 1997. However,'Batman Begins' is more into the comic book version and this time around what Nolan did was focus on the origins of Bruce Wayne and how he was destined to be....The Dark Knight. It has been eight years since the last 'Batman' installment and DC Comics and Warner Brothers(the studio behind the 'Superman','Lethal Weapon',and 'Harry Potter' films)were getting killed off in the competition of superheroes as they were being left in the dust as Marvel Comics dominated the theatres and chalking up winners left and right(the glorious and imaginary 'Blade','The X-Men',and 'Spider-Man' franchises)made a return to the silver screen with the definitive caped crusader adventure. Not only did Nolan make changes to the franchise,but gave it a much darker and sinister tone not to mention hell-bent on revenge. This time around 'Batman' is by himself. Gone are the silly sidekicks,outlandish freaky villains,and stupidical story lines that almost sent the 'Batman' franchise into a Hollywood graveyard of action films never to be heard from again. But here is what is interesting about the new installment that makes this a bona fide winner. Here is a confident storyline the starts the 'Batman' series at ground zero and from there builds momentum as it moves along gracefully with full intense action sequences kick in for maximum enjoyment. This was a polar opposite of the last four films,which in turn went into pop culture and big-budget entertainment. Here screenwriter David Goyer('Blade')and director Christopher Nolan returns the Dark Knight to his original origins based on the comic books reflecting the character as a person and a human being. But fans of the series will be in for a shock and a rude awakening since some of the scenes here are very graphic and are inappropriate for younger children.As for the cast,it boasts a grand line-up of talent. From Oscar Winning actors Morgan Freeman and Micheal Caine to somewhat an all-British entourage with features Gary Oldman,Tom Wilkinson,Cillian Murphy(as the villain Scarecrow)not to mention actress Katie Holmes. But the real star of 'Batman Begins' and the center of attention is actor Christian Bale,who deserves a heap of credit for making the character come to life and come together with great authenticity and he does a excellent job. Bale brings a psychological approach to the character,making him a person of crafty intelligence and sheer qualities to the role. He reinvents the Bruce Wayne character by going deep into the role and it is a deciding factor in a film that goes by grand design and basically strips the franchise down and rebuilds it and from there he gives The Dark Knight authority without either winking or a lot of unnecessary talking and from there the realism of how the character is given says a lot more about the film in general without all the mayhem and without much assistance from some of the special effects needed.In all 'Batman Begins' is the thrill ride of the summer. And how they reconstructed the franchise basically says it all,especially for the film's final moment in which 'Batman' takes on 'The Scarecrow' which superby sets up the villain for the next installment,scheduled for release in the summer of 2007. 'Batman Begins' retains the true origins of the comic book mood,which gives it a more darker,vengeful tone. And from the Christopher Nolan has done a masterful job of bringing back an American Icon.",Null,0,0,29 June 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," David Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia
","Director David Lean's 1962 epic 'Lawrence Of Arabia' is one of the few films hat legitimately deserves to be called not only great,but magnificent. The films appears on virtually all 'ten best' lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings almost every time it it presented. The best way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theatre screen. That caveat aside,this is a masterful 'desert classic' that is appreciate on home video if viewed on a widescreen format is okay,but to see this in a theatre with a audience is worth the movie-going experience. In 1989,Columbia Pictures re-released this classic back in theatres in a re-mastered format and presented in Dobly Stereo sound not to mention was restored to its original format by Robert A. Harris and the results were brilliant. In 1992,the studio released 'The 30th Anniversary' edition exclusively on home video and DVD since this edition of the film was based on the 1989 Robert A. Harris restoration and captures as much of Lean's original intention as any video version can. Structurally,the film is a standard biography,beginning with the subject's death(in a motorcycle accident),brief interviews with people who knew him,and then a chronological recitation of the high points. The first spoken line of the film is 'He was the most extraordinary man I ever knew.' But T.E. Lawrence(Peter O'Toole) is not an easy subject. He is a contradictory figure,and the filmmakers properly don't try to pin him down,allowing him to remain a fascinating enigma throughout. In a visual sense,David Lean combines a sure sense of place with approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely source-John Ford. Lean turns his vast desert canvas into another Monument Valley,and when his Bedouins ride across it,they are not far removed from Ford's cavalry. In many of the early scenes,the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace,and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve. Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape;how the desert changes those who go into it. The complex character was created by playwright Robert Bolt in his first script,and blacklisted Michael Wilson(who also worked with Lean on Bridge On The River Kwai). This Lawrence is at first ambitious,inexperienced young officer who is transformed by his immersion into the Bedoulin world into a messianic hero. Later he comes to understand himself,though his knowledge comes with a large portion of self-loathing. Lawrence's mission,largely his own creation,is to unite the feuding Bedoulin tribes under the leadership of Prince Feisal(Alec Guinness),and to keep the British politicians,as personified by Mr.Dryden(Claude Rains),from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after WWI is over. It is accomplished through a semi-episodic series of battles and raids where Lawrence is sometimes accompanied by Ali(Omar Sharif)and Sheik Auda(Anthony Quinn),and equally difficult bureaucratic struggles he faces with General Allenby(Jack Hawkins).The two sides of the story are clearly contrasted-the blast-furnace desert exteriors and the cool,echoing marble interiors where the army staff does its work. The initial scene of negotiation,when Lawrence has returned from the desert for the first time and meets Allenby takes place in a courtyard,neither interior or exterior. Its a simple device,but an effective way to set the moment apart. In the same way,changes in clothing color and style are used to reveal changes in character,and Lean's none too-subtly inserts motorcycles at odd moments to remind viewers where all this is leading,and the results are beautifully executed to the fullest extent and it shows in such scope and grandeur of the romance,danger,and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. As the filmmakers see it,the central conflict within Lawrence is his simultaneous desire for adventure with is sometimes uncontrollable lust for excitement. The film itself made an unknown actor at the time Peter O'Toole into an international star. His performance is this magnificent epic is worth seeing. The payoff resulted in a total of seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director(David Lean),Best Original Score(Maurice Jarre).",Null,3,5,14 August 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A movie that defies the laws of gravity like no other
","This martial arts epic makes it biggest stride yet into the mainstream of American cimema and its consciousness with this supercharged effort from director Ang Lee(Ride With The Devil and Sense and Sensibility). As on the same wavelength as a Sergio Leone western,this film is basically the first time that Americans can see it without the dubbing since the entire film is in Taiwanese. It is a film of deep complexity and depthas it tackle such issues as honor,devotion,and compassion. The story is very interesting since it deals with the taking of a jade green sword,and then all of a sudden the film kicks into high gear with startling plot twists and astounding action sequences which are the movie's strongest selling points which find characters flying in the air and engaging in combat which perched on either buildings or spindly branches(since the action here was choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping known for his breathtaking effects that really had moviegoers going nuts in 'The Matrix'). This is a film that defines the laws of gravity here,and it's action-packed all the way making it a runaway hit internationally. The scene stealer here is a 18 year old dynamo named Zhang Ziyi who is remarkable opposite her counterparts Chow Yun-Fat(of 'The Replacement Killers',and 'Anna and the King'),and martial arts actress superstar Michelle Yeoh(of 'Supercop' and 'Tomorrow Never Dies').

","SYNOPSIS: A 'cure' for mutancy threatens to alter the course of history. For the first time,mutants have a choice: retain their uniqueness,though its isolates and alienates them,or give up their powers an become human. The opposing viewpoints of mutant leaders which in this case the leader of the X-Men,Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart),who preaches tolerance,and Magneto(a notable but brilliant Ian McKellen)who believes in the survival of the fittest who also believes that this is an outrage against the races and leads to war between the two sides. They are put to the ultimate test that will trigger a war to end all wars leaving complete chaos and total destruction of both mutant and human alike. Meanwhile,Jean Grey(Famke Janssen)is revealed to be alive,but with different powers causing her alter-ego to come out. Now that she is possessed by the powers of the Dark Phoenix-it has become a threat of national security and the rest of the X-Men must race against the clock to stop a mutant war that will end in oblivion.If you have follow the first two installments of the 'X-Men' series than you know the rest of the chapter and its characters in the third and possibly final installment of the series. 'X-Men:The Last Stand' is not the best in the series,but it does have some grand moments that make it stand out. This is one of the most emotional elaborate and mostly complex out of all the series. And if this proves to be the last chapter of the series than it is a disappointment that will leave many of its die-hard fans heartbroken and shocked. However,'X-Men 3' does not disappoint its legion of fans neither. By keeping the same action-packed sequences and brilliant non-stop special effects in tact here,and some of it is jawdropping to believe in what will happen next. Speaking of which this one has more action galore than any of the two previous entries in the whole series and once it catches your attention,you'll see why. Also included is a lot of great visuals here and new characters are added including more mutants who either fight on the side of good or evil. In other words,its a different type of super-hero movie that is totally different from its previous two films. This is courtesy of director Brett Ratner(Rush Hour films),who basically takes over the direction of the two previous installments from Bryan Singer(who was at the helm of the first two X-Men films which were made in 2000 and 2003).For one,there are a lot a mistakes here. Don't get me wrong,the movie is awesome as far as the action sequences and visual effects and extra special effects are involved,but here Ratner is trying to do too much into one movie since the movie runs at a length of 104 minutes long,the fastest movie ever made in the franchise and likely so to some of the X-Men fans who were looking for more here. First off,the story lines in the movie seemed to be separate and basically crammed together into one film,and also if you notice the acting is very redundant here since characters are one-sided. The effectiveness of Ratner's direction was rushed when you can take the same characters and subplots and extend the movie even further which he didn't do. And that's a shame when some characters are rarely used-which in one points are the cases of Mystique and other characters. Speaking of the characters much of it really centers on Jean Grey(Famke Janssen),Storm (Halle Berry),Wolverine(Hugh Jackman),Raven(Anna Paquin),and Cyclops (James Marsden) and new characters introduced are worth noticing: Beast(played with absolutely superb force by Kelsey Grammar),Angel(Ben Foster),and Jaggernaut(Vinnie Jones). Besides the ones that stand out are worth seeing is Wolverine(magnificently played by Hugh Jackman)and the evil mutant/tyrant Magneto(played with mangum force by Ian McKellen). If there is another installment,we will have to see what happens within the characters. This ones is packed action,packed drama,and packed full of surprises.",Null,2,3,10 June 2006
I Am Legend," Riveting Science-Fiction at its finest as only Will Smith delivers and executes brilliantly
","Military virologist Robert Neville(Will Smith) is alone,somewhere on the edge of sanity,patrolling barren New York City streets in a battered SUV,with his steadfast German shepherd,Sam. No pedestrians bustle along Fifth Avenue.,in Times Square,or Chinatown. Yellow taxis sit idle,bumper-to-bumper,with no passengers and no place to go. Grass grows up through the pavement as nature exerts its revenge. Deer herds run wild. Demons lurk in the shadows. It's not a dream. It's a nightmare,a living nightmare. The frightening picture of a world gone astray is very realistic as it gets.Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the aftermath of a plague and desperate isolation has inspired earlier films,including 'The Last Man On Earth'(Vincent Price,1964),and 'The Omega Man'(Charlton Heston,1971). Screenwriter Mark Protosevich,who developed this script with writer/producer Akiva Goldsman(Academy Award winner for 'A Beautiful Mind');Will Smith along with producer James Lassiter(who was behind Will Smith's Oscar nominated film 'The Pursuit of Happiness');and director Francis Lawrence('Constantine')saw this adaptation as a contemporary science-fiction allegory. The year the story is set is in 2012,three years after a manmade,retrofitted virus has run amok. Neville follows his daily routine. He's cordial and keeps conversations with unknowns(such as talking to mannequins)light;it helps him retain some semblance of normalcy. He sends out an S.O.S over the airwaves,'If there is anybody out there,anybody. Please You are not alone.' For means of survival,he patrols Gotham hunting deer and chasing images. As the night falls,he and Sam hunker down in a brownstone near Washington Square. Neville bars the doors and shutters the windows. He curls up in the bathtub in a fetal position with Sam and a submachine gun. Terrified. Things scream outside:the living dead,mutant victims of the plague,dark feeders led by a vicious alpha male(Dash Mihok).Although post-apocalypse films aren't new('Planet of the Apes','Mad Max','The Road Warrior','28 Days Later','Vanilla Sky'),most feature several protagonists. Neville,however,is bereft of any human contact. Haunted by the past,the mass evaculation of New York City,and the loss of his wife(Salli Richardson),and child(Willow Smith),he reasons that he must find a cure for the mutants' misery. The setting of Manhattan has rarely felt so desolute. It's isolated and abandoned. It's dreadful and very terrifying. Danger is around the corner never knowing what Neville would expect toward the unexpected. Never knowing what is over your shoulder. Then from the moment when the dark feeders appear,Robert knows he has to fight for his life,even if it means survival of the fittest. The stark skyscraper ghost town sets an eerie tone. Uncanny special effects and the sound team's fearsome,growling mutant canines,zombie wails,and thunderous deer stampedes augment their efforts. These technical strengths mitigate the film's transgressions. By all rights,'I Am Legend',is stunning entertainment. And it may win that distinction,but not without some flaws. Everything goes right for the first 45 minutes,then over-ambitious plotting,slow pacing and melodrama,it lets the viewer hungry for more quick-tempo action sequences and concise character studies,since overall Will Smith himself,is carrying the balance of the picture. Yet,just about anything goes in a Will Smith movie,and here Smith's performance is magnetic. He digs emotional depths and exhibits a spellbinding aura while sharing screen time with only a dog and menacing shadows. This is riveting science fiction at its finest,with a philosophical concept cloaked in a new age of a world gone astray and a man facing sheer terror at every turn.",Null,1,3,8 January 2008

Men in Black II," Comment to one of the biggest hits of 1997
","I can't believe the next item I'm about to write here,but let me get it out of the way. First of all,I have never seen the original since I heard from some people that it is very good. The only version that I have seen of the Men In Black franchise is ONLY the cartoon version which was fairly passable. But as for the sequel to Men In Black is this quote.................I didn't like MIB:2Even more surprising,its not even a close call with me. It was passable due to the highly populated star status of its biggest stars...actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. It feels overly mechanical,tired,and only half-imagined in which everyone is going through the motions on this one.This one has hardly any zip to it at all even though it only ran for under 90 minutes the whole thing seems like a quick rip-off of the original. Believe me,the minute I paid for my ticket,went to the concession stand to get some snacks and sat down in my seat for the feature presentation,it was over by the time I got ready to see it. That's a shame.",Null,0,3,12 July 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin's back---badder,bloodier,and better
","Well,ladies and gentlemen,it's a new millennium and Quentin Tarantino has got a new movie for us. After changing the popular film landscape in the 1990's with the classics 'Reservoir Dogs','Pulp Fiction',and to a much lesser extent,'Jackie Brown',Tarantino spent a half a decade in hibernation,accompanied by little more than a television set,a movie projector,and collection of Johnny Cash records and a bong. But now he is back after a six year hiatus with 'Kill Bill',a thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles Bronson,Telly Savalas,Burt Reynolds,Clint Eastwood,Fred Williamson,Steve McQueen,Jim Brown and James Coburn. 'Kill Bill' is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like 'Master Of The Flying Guillotine','The Wu',and the television shows like 'Hattori Hanzo'. This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once again,he has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to boot,plus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with her,and Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassin,attached to a criminal group of bodacious martial arts-trained killers(Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Lucy Liu)who are lead by the unseen,shadowy Bill(unseen in the first installment played by David Carradine). Among the crew she was called Black Mamba,but otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her near-term child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. However,a lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a head,a leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slashed,a eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good Kung-Fu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chiba,aka 'The Street Fighter',and so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the way,what Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jackson,however was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in 'Pulp Fiction',which also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in 'Jackie Brown'.However,the film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004. Be forewarned,this not for the kiddies,so use caution when seeing it. In all,one hellva thrill ride.",Null,101,209,14 November 2003
Mission: Impossible II," THE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE OF THE SUMMER
","This was a huge improvement from the last one,and the action here is definitely non-stop from start to finish. However the characters here are fairly okay,but there are more explosions here than emotions. Once again,pretty-boy secret agent Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise),must stop a deadly virus from getting to millions of people,including into the hands of the rogue agent (Dougray Scott). Thandie Newton's character as an international jewel thief looks like she is posing for a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model here(thinking she is Tyra Banks),but this is a far cry for her really then the last movie she did(Oprah's crap 'Beloved'),and she is very good here. The coolest in the whole movie is Ving Rhames as the electronic/computer expert(in the Greg Morris role). The action sequences are slow-paced,but it keeps the suspense going. The best part of the movie is when Cruise's character goes after the rogue agent in a spectacular motorcycle chase that is worth the admission. Give John Woo,who is a master of his craft,a cheering ovation because he knows how to do action movies and I really like his style of this which was way better than Brian DePalma's version of the same title. If I had a choice of what to see this weekend,it would be M:I 2 and its worth seeing twice!!!  Rating:***1/2 out of ****",Null,4,9,27 May 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Stanley Kubrick's greatest masterpiece
","When Stanley Kubrick's '2001:A Space Odyssey', premiered in the summer of 1968,it was a science-fiction movie like no other has ever seen. It was not like the other sci-fi flicks where spaceships and monsters from other worlds attacked people but in a sense it was a dazzling spectacle of innovative technological cimema that would be the forefront of other films to follow years later. When this film was came out,it would be the second biggest attraction for MGM since the days of Charlton Heston in 'Ben Hur',which was the studio's highest grossing picture until 2001 came along. From its first scene with the dawn of mankind,to the eyepopping sequence of the spaceship rotating around the earth is a wonderous marvel to look at and you can't take your eyes away from it. For it's millennium anniversary,MGM is re-releasing it back into theatres and its presented in a format that has been never seen before. For those who have never seen this classic,this is a rare opportunity to see it up close and to experience the opening array of its breathtaking special effects and the way Arthur C. Clarke's story about the innovations of man and machine(including the computer HAL along with the astronauts who go beyond the stars and into the depths of space)is handled with great precision and it is very effective here. Since most of the production design was carefully supervised by Stanley Kubrick himself,it was astounding to see and behold with the powerful score that is set to classical music with the works of Richard Strauss and others.Truly one of the greatest masterpieces of science fiction ever devised.

A Clockwork Orange," An Ingenious Work Of Art---A brilliant portrayal of an youthful society gone wrong in this Stanley Kubrick masterpiece
","This film was not for the faint of heart when it was released in theatres in 1971. This was the third film that Warner Brothers released that was in fact given an strict 'X' rating by the Motion Picture Association Of America since the other two that were 'X' rated from the studio were Mike Nichols''Who Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?',which won the Oscar in 1966 for best Actress for Elizabeth Taylor,and the other was the 1969 graphically violent western of Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' with William Holden and Ernest Borgnine.'A Clockwork Orange',was the first film Stanley Kubrick directed for the studio and would remained with Warners for his next to last films which included 'Barry Lyndon'(1975),'The Shining'(1980),'Full Metal Jacket',(1987),and his final film,'Eyes Wide Shut'(1999) with Tom Cruise. Before he went into this production,which took two years to make,was still flying high after the huge commercial and critical success of his 1968 science fiction masterpiece,'2001:A Space Odyssey' based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke. This time around he went even further into detail into his next film,which would become a cult favorite among the college circuit and one of the top ten strangest films ever made. Based on the graphic novel by Anthony Burgess,'A Clockwork Orange',is 'ingenious Kubrick at his finest' with a science fiction parable that is a 'bold','nightmarish','frightening',and sometimes 'unexpected'.This was in fact a mix of 'sexual content','ultraviolence',and 'mind control',set in a freaky futuristic Britain which follows the travails of a 'unhinged' misunderstood and explicitly violent individual who is the ringleader of a gang of teenage youths and one hellva 'bad boy' who in fact is very 'sinister' yet 'strangely likable' who is misguided by his command of a vicious street gang of 'droogies' who robbed and destroy society as a whole. Through his chilling crimes of the unthinkable to his 'brainwashing' rehab,it threads 'brilliant visuals' and 'twisted' social satire into riveting 'artful stuff'-helped by the bit of the old Ludwig van in the role that made a major star of British actor Malcolm McDowell into an international status under the direction of Kubrick. Before 'Clockwork Orange',McDowell was already a bonafide star from his last picture,which was ultraviolent within itself two years earlier in the political-social thriller 'If'.Even some 40 years after the film's release,it is to see why it still holds vividity still today.

Titanic," An Epic Scale
","Released around the Christmas season of 1997,this was an epic scale of a motion picture event. Director James Cameron's three hour mega-budget picture has its brushes with disaster with a mammoth budget(which at the time this picture was made,it took two years to make and was the most expensive movie ever made at $285 million,the most costliest movie to date)and a theatrical release that seemed unattainable. But instead of reaping hordes of criticism for what many have thought was one of the biggest joke in Hollywood,Cameron received accumlated praise and a boatload of Oscar hardware for his labor of love,which rack up the Academy Awards with 11 Oscars including Best Picture,and has tied the record with 'Ben Hur',and most recently the Lord Of The Rings final installment to the trilogy,'The Return Of The King',as the most record number of Oscars to be presented in Hollywood.This was indeed,'Gone With The Wind' on an epic scale.This was in fact a grand love story that happens to have the sinking of an historic ship as a backdrop,real characters and fictional characters are blended for a detailed re-enactment of the luxury liner's first and last voyage. The main characters,two lovebirds Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio),and debutante Rose Bukater(Kate Winslet)are from different ends of the economic and social ladder. DiCaprio and Winslet are dynamic as the star-crossed lovers and make the running time of 198 minutes less a chore to sit through. The special effects are impressive with a life sized version of the ship just built for the film. Cameron's prowess as a storyteller keeps the outcome of the ship suspenseful and tense even though the ending is no secret. The film contains an all-star cast including Billy Zane,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart(in her final film role),Jonathan Hyde-White,Danny Nicci, Bernard Hill,Victor Garber,Bernard Fox,Suzy Amis,and David Warner.The film has won numerous awards since its release and in 1997,it was the first film to win both the MTV Awards,Golden Globes and Oscars in that same year,not to mention Best Musical Score from composer James Horner and Best Song of that year,'My Heart Will Go On' sung by Celine Dion. Also to point,during its release,'Titanic' went on to break box office records,and it did just that but dethroning the all-time box office champ,'Star Wars',not to mention other box-office records as well including 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark','ET',and others at the time of its release,since then that record has been shattered by the most recent 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy and the 'Harry Potter' series.Released by two major Hollywood studios,Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century-Fox,the film itself has become one of the spectacular Hollywood greats.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Grand adaption of the popular children's book!
","I truly missed this one when it came out in theatres,but now that it is out on videocassette and DVD,I finally got the chance to see last night for the very first time. However,since this was based on the popular best-selling children's books by J.K. Rowling this was a fantasy feature that has come to life. This lavish film version ends up working on both levels: as a stand-alone motion picture and as a worthy adaption of a novel that,while hardly a literary landmark,is nevertheless brilliantly funny,inventive and full of imaginary spunk. Director Chris Columbus has a deserved reputation for making cloying films(Home Alone,Mrs. Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man),but here he has deftly allowed the movie to carefully walked the precious line between being too syrupy for adults and too grave for children(there are some very scary scenes here that may be too intense for those under the age of 12 since the film carries a stern 'PG' rating). In other words,this movie is way,way,COOL! Even though it was just a flick for the kiddies,it was spectacle beyond belief. Part Wizard of Oz,the flying sequence of both Steven Spielburg's E.T.,and part Return Of The Jedi,this was a must see. A grand technical achievement.",Null,0,0,5 June 2002

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Chris Columbus directs pre-Spielburg installment to a Temple of Doom
","Fans of novelist J.K. Rowling publishing juggernaut will be happy to know that the events from the book are faithfully replicated for the screen,but in my honest opinion perhaps too much so for those who might enjoy a little interpretative license. This is particularly the case with this latest installment which looks like a version of a pre-Spielburg  sequel to can we say here,Harry Potter and the Temple of Doom? For one, director Chris Columbus has channeled into the essence of the books to a tee according to the standards of novelist J.K. Rowling. but unlike the first installment the title character here(played by Daniel Radcliffe) is very dull and boring and loses the audiences attention very quickly. The rest of the actors here are absoultely brilliant as played by Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Kenneth Branaugh(doing a delicious turn as a pompous celebrity wizard),Jason Issacs(as the evil nemesis Lord Voldemort is wicked),Robbie Coltrane,Alan Rickman,Maggie Smith,and the late Richard Harris as Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Elsewhere,Columbus does a nice job at the special effects especially with the Quidditch scene is a marvel to behold and the climactic scenes(who have some darker moments) are frightening and superbly done to a shine. As for the acting here for some,its need a little improvement especially with Radcliffe who was brilliant in the first one,but slack off in this installment. Still needs more work to do,and for one this one runs way too long(at over two hours) and this may bore some children under the age of 12 but still has a 'PG' rating.However,the next Harry Potter installment won't be out until the summer of 2004 under the direction of Alfonso Cuaron(in which Columbus wants to do other projects and take a break from the series).",Null,0,0,9 January 2003
The Departed," Overflowing with performances..'The Departed' is one of the best films of the year.
","As with most Martin Scorsese films are:beautifully edited,brutally violent sequences,brimming with life even as bodies are hitting the floor in pool of blood and gore,all awash in a blaring Rolling Stones tune where the musical selection in either Scorsese movie is usually The Rolling Stones' 'Gimme Shelter',or some other signature tune with have the musical selections of either Tony Bennett,Dean Martin or perhaps Frank Sinatra. This is always the case in any mob-gangland crime drama that is coming from any Martin Scorsese movie.His newest venture,'The Departed' is basically the Americanized version of the 2002 Hong Kong hit 'Internal Affairs,'-but this remake of that movie is pure vintage Scorsese at his finest and one of the best films of the year. This comes from a veteran director who knows his territory-who has made a brilliant study and a magnificent film about Boston cops and mobsters(this time around its the Irish mafia instead of the Italian syndicate)with dazzlingly rich performances from a top notch stellar cast and an ambiance that screams Scorsese's typical cultural authenticity. And this is coming from a director who is known for gritty crime dramas,and his returns to that familiar side of the mean streets is a welcome sight. Leonardo DiCaprio,reuniting with the director for a third film following 'Gangs Of New York' and 'The Aviator',stars as Billy Costigan,a Massachusetts State Police detective who has gone undercover to take down syndicate crime boss and head of the Boston Irish mafia Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson, in a devlish tour de force performance that is worth seeing and the return of the Jack Nicholson everybody loves--crazy,out of control and always doing the unexpected). Matt Damon,meanwhile stars as the crime boss'prot√©g√©,Colin Sullivan,who worked his way up the state police ranks to become staff sergeant of the special investigations unit. The two function in a perfect parallel until it starts to become clear that Costello's gang is staying one step ahead of the police,even while the police seem to know too much about Costello's operations. Never the use of cell-phone text messaging seemed so sinister. And so Billy and Colin are each asked to sniff out the rat(or stoolie)in their midst-to seek out each other. It's a nice touch that the two actors(DiCaprio and Damon)so strongly resemble each other,with those crystal blue eyes and a look that can be considered boyish or fiendish,depending on your view or perspective. However,Billy and Colin are on two sides of the same coin,both raised in South Boston,trying to escape their lineage of Southie Irish trash but having chosen opposing routes.(The screenwriter William Monahan grew up in the city of Boston and draws strongly from his roots. He absolutely knows the people and rhythms,not to mention the mean streets of it too. Scorsese shot much of the picture on location in Boston and also in New York,and that actors Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg are natives of the city too--they were born and raised in Boston. If you listen to the accents,at least they got it right.)The movie itself delivers a clever but thrilling moment in each scene and this what makes the film a standout,especially with the performances from the actors. It's movie that grabs your attention and from there it never let's go. 'The Departed' is a game of cat-and-mouse and goes very well with the shocking climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. The brash energy and breathtaking suspense keeps the film on focus throughout. Among the cast members here,Mark Wahlberg is eloquently brilliant as the surly sergeant in the brash detective unit,and basically steals just about every scene he's in; Alec Baldwin as the jacked-up police captain,is just as darkly funny. On the other side,the under-appreciated British character actor Ray Winstone is a force of nature,as always,playing Costello's top thug. Actress Vera Farmiga provides a touch of warmth as a police psychiatrist and the only woman among the main characters-though it is a massive plot contrivance to have her character get involved with both Billy and Colin. Anthony Anderson is along for the ride as one of the detective working under the supervision of Colin. But mostly the film belongs to Jack Nicholson who basically commands every scene and most of all do whatever he's involved. Their work and that of Martin Sheen as the under pressure level handed captain of the department who places Billy undercover,protects his identity and helps him keep sane before his cover is completely blown. At a running time of 154 minutes,this is a movie that is riveting from start to finish with lots of soul searching before reaching its climatic rooftop conclusion. One of the best of the fall batch of the movies to be out this year that stands among the crowd,and for director Martin Scorsese,the Oscar for Best Director will come at a greater time than now for this brilliant masterpiece.",Null,0,2,12 October 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of the best films out of the 1960's......
","The first time I ever saw the movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' as a child growing up,it scared the living daylights out of me. The reason why it scared me so was because of the sinister portrayal of the character of Bob Ewell as the prejudice bigot who comes up in the movie where he pops out of nowhere while Atticus Finch goes into the house of an innocent black man accused of rape. However,the character of Atticus(played by the great Gregory Peck who won an Oscar for his performance)defends him anyway,only to find out that his client,Tom Robinson(played by Brock Peters)didn't do it. The movie goes into detail of how the events occurred and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This was a much loved and critically acclaimed film that tells all of just how growing up in the South was like during the 1930's in the fictional town of Macon,Alabama. It goes into childhood innocence,racial prejudice of all counts,(and contains several of it in there)as well as moral tolerance and courage. No wonder it was on the AFI's most 100 lists of the greatest movies of all time,and one of the most memorable films of the 20th century.

Man on Fire," The 'worst' Denzel Washington picture ever made.
","Ever since actor Denzel Washington got into show business,and after all the movies he has made,there has never been a 'really bad' Denzel Washington picture until now and this is the worst Denzel movie ever made,but let's face it since it is not all really Denzel's fault,but lets really put the blame on this piece of unadulterated garbage of bad taste cimema. The person responsible for this mayhem? Director Tony Scott(the younger brother of Oscar winning director Ridley Scott of Gladiator,Alien,Blade Runner,Hannibal,and above others to name a few)who is in the running for the title of 'Hollywood's most despicable director',and in the running for 'The worst movie director in Hollywood',second to another despicable director as well:Roland Emmerich,director of Independence Day,Godzilla,The Patriot,Day After Tomorrow,etc. However,Tony Scott takes sleek-violence porn to a new low in this cynically sleazy account of an alcoholic bodyguard(Denzel Washington) who goes on a blood soaked rampage of unstoppable revenge after kidnappers apparently kill the cute little blond girl(Dakota Fanning) he was hired to protect. There is zero humanity to this whole enterprise;in fact,it serves itself as exhibit A in explaining why other parts of the world see the West as spiritually corrupted and irredeemably decadent. Scott's garishly overheated style of violence,which he tries to copycat Quentin Tarentino so wildly, that is looks like a compendium of Tv-ad cliches,since it makes its audience wonder why in the hell he holds himself in greater contempt,or is it with the audience,the material of the film,or basically over egoing over himself. As for Denzel Washington's performance in this film,apparently convinced by his 2001 Oscar for Best Actor in 'Training Day',goes to show that Hollywood only awards portrayals of degenerate blacks that are negatively showed,and for an prime example of stereotyping African-Americans,see Halle Berry's 2001 Oscar for Best Actress in 'Monster's Ball' as a oversee of Hollywood racism within the ranks.",Null,0,2,5 June 2004

The Last King of Scotland," The Last King Of Scotland
","The year 2006 has been without a doubt a outstanding year in the history of the cinema. However one of those movies 'The Last King Of Scotland' is among the best out of the bunch of films that came out this year competiting against movies like 'Dreamgirls','The Queen', 'Children Of Men','The Flags Of Our Fathers','Pan's Labyrinth','The Departed',and so much more.'The Last King Of Scotland',brilliantly tells the strange and gripping story of a young Scottish doctor(James McAvoy from 'The Chronicles Of Narnia')who in 1971 signs up fresh out of college with the British Ministry of Health to work in a remote Ugandan village and winds up living the high life in the capital city of Kampala,clutched to the turbulent bosom of General Idi Amin(Forest Whitaker). The film is inspired by true events and it is based on the 1998 novel by Giles Foden. Amin,of course,was real,as was his jokey,buffoonish charm,and there was also a sadistic side to him as well....his regime was totally responsible for the brutal slayings of over 300,000 people leaving the country of Uganda is total chaos under his command. He also have a flair and a kitschy love of all things Scottish(He once declared himself the last king of Scotland.) Forest Whitaker's electrifying performance as Amin is one for the ages and this is an actor whose sweet,jovial features counteract his imposing physique and vise versa given two sides to a character who can be good and sadistically evil,creating of curious tension that he fully exploits here. Dr. Nicholas Garrigan(James McAvoy)however,is fictional-though he did have a real-life counterpart in a former British soldier named Bob Astles,who became one of Amin's closest advisors. Fresh out of medical school and reluctant to settle down to a life of stew,sherry,and Presbyterianism,Garrigan has fled Scotland in search of adventure in Africa,which takes him to one of the most dangerous countries in the world-Uganda. Arriving in Uganda on the day of Amin's coup,he is met by Sarah(Gillian Anderson of 'X-Files' fame),the lonely,tousled wife of the only other doctor in town. Sarah represents just the sort of trouble Nicholas is drawn to-mysterious,complex,and none of his business,and his attraction foreshadows a yet more reckless dalliance.After a chance encounter that has Nicholas doctoring up Amin's injuries from a car accident,he is offered the job of Amin's personal physician. Soon he's installed in a swanky apartment,hanging out in nightclubs,and speeding through the streets of Kampala in a Mercedes convertible. This was a movie that was shot on location in Scotland and Uganda,the film shows a side of Africa rarely depicted in the movies. Kampala's bustling energy and striking midcentury architecture reflect Nicholas' youthful optimism. But as the movie progresses,the streets becomes cast in a oppressive hush,and the beautiful,futuristic buildings start to look like symbols of the dangers of scorched-earth reinvention. Nicholas' vanity,idealism and lust for adventure make him especially vulnerable to Amin's insidious charm. He willfully ignores early signs of trouble,the better to bask in his new role as the dictator's best friend and confidant,choosing to believe he is helping usher Uganda into its iteration as a free black African nation. Director Kevin Macdonald,who basically specializes in documentaries,captures the energy and exuberance of a young nation in the throes of optimism and works into a foreboding frenzy. As for Forest Whitaker(an actor knows for his impressive work in films such as 'Bird','Platoon','A Rage In Harlem','Jason's Lyric','Ghost Dog','Species','Fast Times At Ridgemont High','Good Morning Vietnam',and not to mention his directorial work in the films 'Waiting To Exhale' starring Whitney Houston and 'Hope Floats',starring Sandra Bullock)in the role of Idi Amin,he plunges deep into the psychology of the role,portraying Amin as a sadistic erractic personality who explodes into a galloping paranoia. His strange fascination seems to spark a regression once he is in power and it changes throughout the course of this movie. Nicholas, of course is a child as well,focused on his own thoughtless gratification. He sees the absolute madness before him and knows now what Amin has done. In one scene,one of his lovers(Kerry Washington)reminds him what they face if they're caught. Towards the end,he does escape Uganda alive with his life.

Jaws," Released in the summer of 1975
","I was only 11 years old when I saw this film and it gave me a awareness of water safety I have never known. And from there it gave a whole new meaning about the creatures of the deep and their contact with them when you're in the water and what to do if they come your way. This movie serves as a reminder of the dangers that are out there on our beaches these days especially with the recently attacks on people.That movie was 'Jaws'. Released in the summer of 1975 and this was the movie that gave theatregoers the term 'summer blockbuster' long before the onslaught of George Lucas' spacesaga would invade theatres two years later. This would go on to be the #1 boxoffice draw during that year and eventually received an Oscar nomination for its musical score from composer John Williams.Since this is based on Peter Benchley's novel of the same title(who would go on to put two other novels out based on monster sea creatures as well including 'The Deep'-which was made into a movie starring Nick Nolte in 1977,and 'The Beast'-which was made into a TV-movie about a giant killer squid)and it is about a killer shark who wrecks havoc on a seaside community in Massachusetts during a July the 4th activity fest.About the movie,what is there to say? First off,you have the elements of a good suspense thriller(which director Steven Spielburg takes cues from Alfred Hitchcock for suspenseful techniques),and one hell of an action/horror flick that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat because you'll never know what to expect next. 'Jaws' was one scary movie and to this day it still holds that effect. Steven Spielburg's first foray into suspense garnered him status and praise as a director and he still has that in some of movies he does turned out(from the breathtaking sequences in 'Close Encounters','Raiders Of The Lost Ark', 'E.T.',to his latest projects 'Minority Report'and others).This is the first. A Grand Classic from the golden age of 70's cimema. Kudos to Roy Scheider(Brody),Robert Shaw(Quint),Richard Dreyfuss(Harper),and Lorraine Gary for making it happen. Peace.",Null,0,1,25 October 2002
Hitch," Same concept we have seen before,but here is the comical timing of Will Smith that makes the film standout
","Who says that this was Will Smith's first foray into comedy? You are gladly mistaken. 'Hitch' is not the first time that Will Smith has done a comical role,but lets say that his first was in a 1989 movie in which he starred opposite Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg and a teenage looking Nia Long,but I forgot what the title of that movie is,but I get back to that later. However,he is known for his comical hijinks and hilarious antics on both movies and television,and for those who forgot his stint on television for his classic series from the 1990's 'The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air',which ran for six years on NBC-TV,is a must see for those who wondered where Will Smith homed in onto his craft,and this was way before he came 'Mister Hollywood',and to put it bluntly,'Major Hollywood Box office Star'. But these days he still holds the title of such a accomplish feat,and still puts out a very good hip-hop album every once in a while. But his newest venture is just that:nothing but an amusing mixed bag of hijinks that Will Smith always has been doing with a element of every romantic storyline that everyone has seen before,and so forth. Smith's character is just like any character we have seen before in romantic comedies,where the main character charms the chicks,but helps out a hopeless character,who couldn't score with the women get his play on,but in the long run his A-Game is out and he needs to get back into the swing of things before his loses his 'mackness',and so on. Here,Will Smith plays a 'date doctor',who helps out an accountant(played by Kevin James of the TV-series King Of Queens)into shape so that he can get the woman of his dreams,in this case a millionaire heirless(Amber Valletta).Our character falls for a gossip columnist(Eva Mendes)where he not only loses his chemistry but his game into getting the ladies. Actually we have heard this story before,but in some aspects it is two distinct movies in one,but for the most part of it is very funny in some aspects especially within some of the scenes and not to mention the romantic chemistry that sparkles between Will Smith and Eva Mendes is very charming indeed,but the main part of the film is nothing but Will Smith at his comical best. But as far as the story is concern,since Smith is not only the star,but is also the co-writer and executive producer. But the real problem is the script,where the first half is excellent,but comes apart where it grinds to a halt during the film's tedious second and final acts of the movie. But for those huge fans that love Will Smith,this will be a change for his usual work and to me it is not bad at what everyone else thinks of this film. For the most part,just see this for the love of 'Big Willie'.",Null,0,0,18 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George Lucas saves the best for last in the final installment of the trilogy
","In the summer of 1977,a little known movie named 'Star Wars',about characters who reside in a galaxy far,far,away became a mixture of sorts with very little fanfare when it was first released. The movie was a grand throwback to the Saturday matin√©e serials of the 1930's and 1940's,with different elements that resulted in science fiction,movie Westerns,Greek and Japanese mythologies,comic books and other stuff combine would basically find an audience,and from its opening sequence the rest of the story is Hollywood history. From the day the first installment of the original 'Star Wars' film roared into theatres on May 25,1977,it became an instant classic in cinematic history,and one of the most influential films of the late 20th Century,which began the crystallization between its young viewers and special effects. It was the roadside attraction of the summer of 1977 and what 'Star Wars' did was not only saved 20th Century-Fox from sudden bankruptcy but in a sense saved Hollywood thanks to George Lucas. From this,it spawned two sequels to the original trilogy,'The Empire Strikes Back'(1980),and the final installment,'Return Of The Jedi'(1983),and its prequels to the trilogies 'The Phantom Menace'(1999),and 'Attack Of The Clones'(2002). and now the final installment to his six-part chapter to the 'Star Wars' trilogy-'Episode III:The Revenge Of The Sith'(2005)bring the thrilling conclusion to one of the most beloved and most spectacular science-fiction sagas of all time.Before 1977,so-called 'space movies' were typically grim and very Earth-centric involving humankind's journey into the great unknown and more often often encounter visitors from other worlds and distant planets. The last science-fiction movie to have that effect and was in fact astounding masterpiece of cinematic greatness to give audiences a view of the future as it would be seen years from now(A prime example of this was Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science-fiction classic '2001')not to mention in contact with other beings visiting our world(Examples of this would be,'Metropolis','Forbidden Planet' 'The Day The Earth Stood Still','Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun','Fantastic Voyage','The Angry Red Planet','Westworld',and' The Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'). But by the mid-1970's 'Star Wars' redefine the science-fiction genre with sheer brilliance and great achievement in its great storytelling and grand detail. George Lucas was basically the most creative and dominant force behind all six of his films,which used state-of-the-art FX and computer-generated technology that revolutionized the movie genre and eventually saved Hollywood. As far as his full installment of his saga would take nearly 28 years later to be completed(until 2005),die-hard fans of the space saga won't have to wait this time around. Episode III is the conclusion in which George Lucas saves the best for last in the final installment of his beloved space opera,and here it doesn't disappoint. Episode III does have its share of diversions in some parts,but here it appreciates and exploits an underpinning of Greek tragedy with a focus that hasn't been since 1983's The Return Of The Jedi. The remarkable results are visually stunning to behold especially with the opening space battle sequence to the Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader under the discipleship of the movie ultimate villain,Darth Sidious,aka Chancellor Palpatine,played with an utmost authoritative supremacy by Ian McDiarmid. But the real star of this film is Hayden Christensen who gives the character of Anakin Skywalker and dark and mysterious presence as he prepares to learn more and to cross over the dark side of the force. Very impressive. Props also go to Ewan McGregor as well. The romance between Anakin and Padme was just the central point that the conflict between the two lovers was just part of the trilogy to come never the less,end quickly,and by all means there was no romantic inter space between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman since this was the scene in the movie that basically falls flat. Their relationship was like a cross between teen puppy love and a sappy soap opera that never seen to ever get to develop since Actress Natalie Portman,who starred in all of Episodes I thru III,was never given a chance to show her talent. The same can be said with Samuel L. Jackson,who was greatly miscast here as Mace Windu. It really is as the focal point of the film that actor Ewan McGregor who starred in all Episodes I thru III is basically the real star of the series and it is his character that carries the film throughly as Obi-Wan.From the beginning of the film,several scenes with include the amount of death and dismemberment reaches copious levels that the camera lingers over into graphic detail. The most shocking scene is the slaughter of 'younglings' which would be unthinkable in the earlier 'Star Wars' films,and unimaginable just to let you know that this film is not for the kiddies,sturdy of its 'PG-13' rating. The climax between Obi-Wan and Anakin where they battle on the lava planet is at the climax of the film reaches an operatic verve,and this is where the story folds into Episode IV,where Anakin is transform into the super-villain,Darth Vader,while on the other hand,Padme gives birth to twins Luke and Leia in which both children are separated and well hidden from Vader. Padme dies,and from there Vader and his evil emperor rule the Galactic empire. But Obi-Wan lives and so does Yoda and the robots R2D2 and C3PO and the wookie Chewbacca who continue onward in Episode IV,with the exception of Yoda,who would appear again in Episode V:The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI:The Return Of The Jedi. A grand finish to a great series and a grand finale in the history of the cinema. Now that this series is over with,George Lucas will find other project to work on and I heard that the origins of his beloved space saga will end up on television(Let's hope not),or returned to do more work on the next installment to Indiana Jones or returned for another installment to his 'American Graffiti' film from the 1970's. However,we'll see what happens after 'Star Wars'.",Null,0,6,26 May 2005
Ray," BRILLIANT! TAYLOR HACKFORD DOES THIS AGAIN! THIS TIME IN THE MOST ELECTRIFYING FILM OF THE YEAR!
","Back in 1982,director Taylor Hackford made a impressive movie about the life in the military and the relationship between a Navy Private and his Drill Instructor in the box office hit,'An Officer And A Gentlemen',which starred Richard Gere,Debra Winger and David Keith. That film would give Louis Gossett,Jr. the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and the film itself was history in the making. This time around Taylor Hackford will make Oscar history again,this time around in what the rest everybody else is saying is the movie of the year,and as for myself I have seen this picture not once but three times already,and it is a winner. And I mean 'Oscar' written all over it. The reason why 'Ray' is a must-see event is due to the electrifying performance of Jamie Foxx is one of the reasons to see this big as numbers Hollywood biography of a musical legend,who became one of the founders and the architects of soul and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.....the master and the genius of soul himself...Ray Charles. Foxx's performance in this movie is a straight tour-de-force from which the likes of accuracy and sheer brilliancy throughout and it holds you like you're not just watching Jamie Foxx there,you're really watching Ray Charles himself,and Jamie Foxx pulls this off with such grace and it is beautifully executed and it is a wonderful joy to watch this performer do this since Foxx carries the film throughout. Its pulsating to watch and even at over two hours,its worth the entertainment. Don't miss this film! Rating:*****-Five Stars",Null,0,2,11 November 2004
X2: X-Men United," Don't call this a sequel,call it a successor to one of the biggest hits of the summer
","Let's see. It has been three years since the last installment of the series based on the characters from Marvel Comics,but lets just say that this one has live up to its reputation. The second installment to the series,'X2:X-Men United' is going to really satisfy its fans from the first one,including zealous devotees of the comic books that spawned the flicks. With this new installment,director Bryan Singer is able to leap into the foray without the cumbersome character and situation setups needed for the initial film,so with this one,'X2' rips along at a faster pace,pulsing with wilder action sequences and more dazzling visual effects than ever before. Also added to the new mix and a new batch of characters mixed in with some of their most deadliest rivals,but in this one unlike the first,it sees the two rival mutant factions(led by Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellan's Magneto) join forces over a governmental society that wants to get rid of mutants and here is where the action really flies off the ground,and it doesn't disappoint. Also,this one is more darker and longer than the first one(over two hours long)and it also explores into each one of mutants capablities. Call this one a installment worth waiting for,and it shows as one of the first post-September 11th blockbusters of the summer. Rating: ****1/2 out of ***** stars.",Null,0,0,13 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of an brilliant trilogy which still holds strong today
","On this day,Wednesday,May,25 of 1977 would be a day to remember in the history of motion pictures and science fiction itself. On this day,the eagerly awaited premiere of one of Hollywood's biggest secrets opened that day in theatres across the country and it would do so throughout the remainder of that year and well into the end of the decade.For one,this film would go on to become the biggest boxoffice champ of its day and would hold that status for the next couple of years. The film tooked four years in the making with a aresnal of top notch special effects never before heard of was history in the making with all of the elements combined with Greek mythological mixed in with all the elements of a American western,and with it the references of movies ranging from Akika Kurosawa to John Sturges not to mention thrown it with the surprise element of the grand Saturday Matinee serials of the 1930's and 1940's. In other words,it redefined with science fiction was meant to be and that made it very impressive with the critics and from there audiences couldn't wait to see since the day it opened long lines from blocks away were waiting to see it and would eventually see it again,and again.The Film? 'STAR WARS' released in the summer of 1977 by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and by Twentieth Century-Fox. Fox pulled some great odds for this film since the studio itself was fighting to stay alive and it needed a blockbuster to bring it back to prominence,and it did just that. This was a visionary blockbuster that was eyepopping from the get-go which was a 'quantum leap' that 'redefined the entertainment industry' and established a 'dynasty' by locating the 'universal' in a 'galaxy far,far away' where 'original' critters,'futuristic samurais',side with a put-upon princess against the ruthless evil empire controlled by the most diabolical villain in the history of cimema,the merciless evil tyrant,LORD DARTH VADER for the control of the galactic empire and the universe itself,only to be stopped in his tracks by a unknown lad named Luke Skywalker,his companion Obi-Wai Knonbi,and renegade ex-soldier named Han Solo and a furry sidekick Chewbecca,a wookie. Together they must rescue the princess,and above all get-by the guards and save the universe from a certain fate. This builds up to a showdown against the forces of evil that is vastly entertaining with a mix of some modern myth,and it is a 'thrill-and-a half' FX spectacular galore that is in a class by itself. In other words,'STAR WARS',not only saved 20th Century-Fox from a complete disaster and a near bankruptcy of the studio, but also it was 'the movie that saved Hollywood',thanks to George Lucas. The movie made international stars of its cast which consisted of a unknown actors at the time who were hitting their stride,Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Harrison Ford,with a stellar cast of British actors:Sir Alec Guinness,Peter Cushing,and the voice of Darth Vader,James Earl Jones.The first 'STAR WARS' film won six Oscars including several for best musical score from the legendary Hollywood composer John Williams,and for it impressive special effects. The film of 1977.However,'STAR WARS:EPISODE IV:A NEW HOPE',didn't stop there since Lucas insisted there was more to come,and it came too. The next one was even bigger and would be heralded as one of the best in the original trilogy and still holds up very well.'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK',also released by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and 20th Century-Fox roared into theatres in the summer of 1980,and it would become one of 'the darkest of Star Wars series'. This worthy first sequel features more depth in its characterizations and 'the best storyline so far' which included revealing many important secrets about the origins of Luke Skywalker and man he rarely knew whom would become his father before turning into the evil Darth Vader. However,a new character was introduced as well,a renegade named Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee-Williams(whom most remember from 'Lady Sings The Blues' and 'Mahogany' with actress/songstress Diana Ross back in the early 1970's). However,the sequel has no wooden dialogue from the first film,but here it is more 'adult-oriented' of the original trilogy while that open-ended cliffhanger of a finale makes for a suitably spectacular windup since of this one George Lucas serves as executive producer and writer here and leaving the directorial duties to Irvin Kershner. Also Oscar nominated as well for John Williams' musical score. One of the top ten highest grossing films of 1980.The final episode of the Star Wars trilogy ended with Richard Marquand taking over the directorial duties with George Lucas serving as executive producer for 'THE RETURN OF THE JEDI',released by Lucasfilm,Ltd.,and Twentieth Century-Fox on Memorial Day weekend in May of 1983. This was indeed a 'worthy sequel' or 'leftovers' from the last installment,but in all fairless it was a bitter disappointment. The storyline was very good in every detail,especially with the 'good-versus-evil' conflict between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader in a climatic showdown and some of the coolest special effects ever devised especially in the amazing 'final battle' in the destruction of the Death Star is amazing beyond belief. What didn't make it stand out in some of the segments is the weakest entry in the series which is overrun by Jabba The Hutt,cute-furry Ewoks,and the realization between Luke and his long lost sister he never knew. But in all fairless,this was the end of a trilogy that was really completely destroyed 16 years later in 1999,by THE PHANTOM MENACE,which was the weakest link in the history of the Star Wars series.",Null,1,2,10 December 2003
Gangs of New York," A sprawling epic not to be missed
","Martin Scorsese's long awaited epic 'The Gangs of New York' clocks in at 168 minutes,but it is one of the grandest epics that you will see anywhere else and also this will be the year that the director of such classics as 'Mean Streets','Taxi Driver','Raging Bull','Goodfellas', and 'Kundan' will finally win the Oscar for Best Director. As for the movie itself,it's a violent sprawling epic set in the early 1860's in an area of Lower Manhattan known as Five Points,a wretched neighborhood sullied by routine bloodshed,police brutality,political corruption,seething ethnic tensions and rampant lawlessness. But as for the film in general,it would have been benefited from some serious trimming. If Scorsese had jettisoned the meandering subplots and underdeveloped characters,thereby lopping it off an hour or so,then 'Gangs' might have been more of the potent picture it was meant to be and so forth.On the other hand,'Gangs',paradoxically,might have also benefited from being longer. Though it largely takes place in a confined location,'Gangs' is a ambitious movie,and Scorsese's canvas is huge,rich,with thematic elements and historical ramifications. Another half-hour or more into the running time could have served to fill in the gaps. As it is,'Gangs',despite its panoramic reach,is at heart a straightforward revenge tale,as well as old fashioned Western,with feuding immigrant groups,axes and cleavers in place of cowboys,Indians, arrows,and guns. Gussied up with Dante Ferreti's extraordinary production design and bogged down by a messy narrative,the movie shackles Leonardo DiCaprio(of 'Titanic')in a one-note role which features a game but out-of-element Cameron Diaz,and relegates such fine actors as Liam Neeson,John C. Reilly,Henry Thomas,and Brendan Gleason to the background.In the foreground,however,is Daniel Day-Lewis,and does he ever give the film some juice. Absent from the screen for six years(his last film was 1997's 'The Boxer')he is a volcanic presence as William Cutting,better known as Bill The Butcher,a vicious gang leader who controls and rules all of Five Points. With his sideburns,upcurled mustache,greasy hair and stovepipe hat,the character could have come across as a caricature,and in some respects he does pull this one off brilliantly. But Mr. Day-Lewis swaggering,fericious performance somehow goes over-the-top yet remains rooted in reality. His flamboyantly chews up the scenary,plowing through caricature and transcending it to emerge as one of the most startling villains ever displayed on the screen.From its opening sequence in 1846 that includes a brawl between Irish gangs and immigrants to the backdrop of the 1863 draft riots with the protest of the Civil War not to mention political corruption adds a foreground to the story and keeps it going strong. 'Gangs of New York' is more than a triumph of atmosphere and production design than anything else. The film was shot at the legendary Cinecitta Studios in Rome,and the Five Points set looks like a set to make it realistic. Yet the meticiously realized neighborhood,with its melting pot of accents and outdated slang,its saloons and floozies,its murderers and thieves,its poverty and filth and abandoned children is a character unto itself. Scorsese has crafted a robust movie that,from moment to moment,is powerful and sometimes pulses with vitality,but the picture gets away from him. Still,there are enough impressive moments to recommend this movie which is one of the year's best films. It will be interesting to watch during the Oscar ceremonies to see if Daniel Day-Lewis,who tour-de-force should put him at the front of the Oscar for Best Actor race and Scorsese for Best Director,not to mention Best Picture.",Null,0,0,10 January 2003
Slumdog Millionaire," The overall Oscar contender for Best Picture of 2008, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is simply brilliant
","The Indian police are faced with a quandary: How could a street urchin from the slums of Mumbai accomplish what doctors and college graduates have been unable to do-win the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' This is the mystery at the heart of this feel-good fairy tale from director Danny Boyle,the man who directed such memorable classics as 'Trainspotting','A Life Less Ordinary','Sunshine'(the Oscar winner of 2006),and was the helm behind the science fiction/horror thriller '28 Days Later'. 'Slumdog Millionaire' works on all levels as simply brilliant as a forerunner of the 2008 Oscar race for Best Picture. One question away from winning 20 million rupees,Jamal(Dev Patel)is arrested on the suspicion of cheating. In order how to explain how an uneducated orphan could know the answers to the questions faced on the show,Jamal is forced to recount his life story for his interrogators. He must provide them with explanations for each answer has has correctly given,up to the penultimate question.The real star of the film is the city of Mumbai which is gorgeously brought to life by Boyle's expert work. The overcrowded slums breathe energy into the film's atmosphere as the cameras careen in and out of the narrow streets of Mumbai's shantytowns. The city is characterized by extremes that define and parallel Jamal's life. Although each life-altering experience conveniently provides Jamal with the knowledge he needs later in life,the movie never feels overly contrived. The script weaves an engaging tale of penury,love and friendship. Jamal's life hurtles from extreme poverty to obscene wealth,but he is a character the audience will root for the entire way.The film is intentionally gimmicky. It really casts a life of horror and squalor as an upbeat love story. But because the film never tries to be anything but an entertaining rags-to-riches narrative,it succeeds beautifully in every detail. One of the year's best films of 2008.",Null,3,7,20 November 2008
Gladiator," GLADIATOR RULES!!!!!!
","Not since the days of Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner(for that manner) there has been a movie of such tremendous scope and power ever constructed in a motion picture of this magnitude on an epic scale. This was a far cry from the recent glorification of 'Titanic',and it was well worth the change. I put it on the same ground level as Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus',and William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur',but it gives more of a volucity and surroundinged then ever since Mel Gibson's picture 'Braveheart',especially the scene where Russell Crowe's character takes on the German tribes in one bloody battle opening sequence. But the part of the colisseum in Rome is one eye-popper here,and where he battles two opponents and a man-eating tiger is well worth the admission. If I had a choice of a movie to see on a Friday or Saturday night(whether the local mutilplex or the area drive-in theatre),I would see 'Gladiator' again,and again!!!!!!

","Long before anyone heard of 'The Sopranos',there was the ultimate epic flick that changed everything in the history of crime dramas and also remains one of the top ten films of all time,and still holds the title today which spawn two sequels and was the film of the decade. This was the apex of what American cimema was and still is today.'The Godfather' was perhaps the best three hours you can spend sitting very still and for a good reason. This was one of the top ten films of 1972 and it was a huge success at the boxoffice. This was 'the ultimate gangster film',and a 'cultural phenomenon' that still holds true. This was an 'absolutely flawless',an 'American epic' based on the best selling novel by Mario Puzo and directed by Francis Ford Coppula. It recounts the 'operatic' lives of the Corleone family via through its 'intricate' plot,bravura 'photography' from cimematopgrapher Gordon Willis and 'iconic performances' from actors Marlon Brando,Al Pacino Diane Keaton,Robert Duvall,James Caan,John Cazale,and Sterling Hayden. This was the film that depicted the cold side of the mafia life and it was never shown before and it also gave Brando an Oscar in 1972 for Best Actor and it also won Best Picture honors for that same year.In fact,the end result is so 'killer' that 'nothing comes even close-except the sequel that followed it which basically picks up where the first part of 'The Godfather' left off.'The Godfather:Part Two'-picks up where the first installment of Mario Puzo's epic novel left off. It was a 'real rarity-a sequel as good as the original'-this 'true masterpiece' stands on its own laurels as it delves deeper into the Corleone family saga from the early life of a younger Vito Corleone played by Robert De Niro in a breathtaking performance that is not to be missed,to the family's transactions within the organization. It is a moody meditation on the emptiness of power,it's complex plot through its masterfully intercuts that gives us two stories separated by a half-century into a taut heartbreaking tale of innocence lost and though never overshadowing its bigger brother which in turn doesn't go overboard within the boundaries of the book. But it is even more subtle and sublime with some chilling moments between the relationship between Michael and his cousin Fredo. A supporting brilliant cast with includes Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,Diane Keaton,John Cazale it won six Oscars including Best Picture of 1974 and also directing honors for Francis Ford Coppula.
