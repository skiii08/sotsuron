Despicable Me 2," Ta-da!
","Oh yeah, I did it, I did it! OK seriously. The first one was magnificent, the sequel... while it did make me a bit nervous on hearing the announcement....delivered.Honestly it was so much fun. I thought I would be watching this by myself tomorrow (July 3) but on a whim decided to check the times to see when I should set my alarm for the first showing. Lo and behold there it is, July 2. Showtimes. I head over to the theater and find my favoritest boss in the whole world and some mutual friends of ours.We laughed our pants off right from the opening 'Ta-da!' until the last... hehehe bottom.Highly recommended. Take the entire family. It's great. I am so happy they made this one.",10,1,1,2 July 2013
Enchanted," What a complete waste.... of Idina Menzel
","Seriously. The references and cameos are adorable please do not get me wrong. I chuckled at a lot of the 'fish out of water' moments. I could watch this with children and friends and find it perfectly acceptable. Even better was having honest moments with Giselle and Morgan which were real life lessons in the midst of the fairy tale. Bonus, having the 'damsel in distress' switch was a nice pay off in the end but having someone like Idina Menzel who is more than amazing not sing once is a terrible waste of a movie. True she went onto Frozen and most likely will be bigger and better but the surprise in finding her in this movie is tainted by the pure wastefulness of her even being it. Almost anyone could've played her part and the the worst thing.",5,0,0,18 August 2014
