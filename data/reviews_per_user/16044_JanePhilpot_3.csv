Your Name.," The Japanese Sure Know How To Unleash
","Beauty, Mystery and Creativity, don't they?I am scared for the day Jar Jar Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy get hold of this and make the hero a Disney princess and bore all our pants off.before Disney gives Kimi No Na Wa the Ghost In The Shell treatment get hold of this original and beautiful film.
