","Amazing. Would recommend. Great action, great writing, great performances, especially by Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Judi Dench and Naomie Harris. It's definetely Craig's best film, and one of the best bond films.",8,4,7,1 May 2018

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider man homecoming review
","I watched it. It sucked. Here's why:1. The cinematography is bland as hell. Too much green screen. It gives the film an ugly, greyish, bland look, that belongs in a much cheaper movie. Not one with a budget of $175 million. 2. The soundtrack. I found the soundtrack on youtube. I just looked up 'stock action music'. 3. The tone. This movie settles for a light hearted, disney movie style tone. Which is bad. It means that nothing in the film has any weight or gravity to it. The villain is often turned into a joke. The relationships are barely developed if at all. Nothing the villain does is dangerous or threatens anyone, and Spiderman's over powered, just to add to that effect. Nothing spiderman does has any impact, and he has no character arc; He begins the movie as reckless and overconfident, and then gets his suit taken away because of it. But instead of learning anything, he does something else reckless, and gets the suit back for it. So what's the lesson learnt?4.",7,0,1,18 April 2018

","When this movie was announced, the premise actually sounded pretty intriguing. But sure enough, through a combination of lame CGI, stale humour, terrible pacing and poor character development, they made this movie boring. Well done. But this movie still gets a 10/10 instant classic marvelpiece.",6,0,1,15 May 2018

","Incredibly creative, well written, memorable, with a great depth and meaning behind it, helping this film become truly great. One of the best movies of 2014, and one of the best animated movies since Wall-E.",8,0,0,7 May 2018
The Lego Movie," More than a cheap cash grab
","In 2013, everyone thought that this movie was gonna suck. A cheap cash grab to increase Lego's sales. Another dumb, bland kids movie, like Frozen and Despicable me. Boy, we were wrong.",8,0,0,7 May 2018

Avengers: Infinity War," My thoughts on Infinity War
","Infinity war was a perfectly entertaining summer movie. That is all. Not as good as the original Avengers, or as good as Winter Soldier or Civil war, but certainly better than age of ultron.",7,1,3,7 May 2018

The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight is awesome
","This movie is simply awesome. More than deserves a score of 9/10. And a lot of people will say that this movie is overhyped, and here's why you are wrong, and I am right;1. Heath Legend's Joker: Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker really stands out in this film. Thanks to Ledger's A-game acting, the Joker in this movie was, as well as being terrifying, also captivating to watch for the audience. 2. The script; This film is very well written and well paced. Every character is seemingly effortlessly fleshed out and developed, and little about the characters is ever told to us (think 'show don't tell'), it is all shown to us through the plot and the characters' actions. Most movies nowadays don't do this.3. Pacing: This movie is paced very well4. Practical effects over CGI: Instead of being a bloated, overdone, loud, obnoxious, sense-overloading cringefest like age of Ultron and Suicide squad, this movie opts for practical effects, which gives the film a more grounded and realistic tone, keeping the audience engaged consistently. 5. Humour: This movie isn't the funniest movie, I know. It's not Ant man. But when there is humour, it doesn't feel forced, it feels natural and fits in the conversation. The same can't be said for many movies nowadays. 6. Depth; There's a lot of depth to this movie, and it makes the audience question their own lives, and differentiates this movie from the popcorn flicks that we're so used to seeing. Most prominent are themes of human nature, selfishness vs selflessness, the human survival instinct, morals and rules, and anarchy, which are all well developed throughout. 7. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. Although Ledger's Joker (as mentioned above) was the most memorable performance of the film, Eckhart is no slouch. His performance as Dent is realistic and often terrifying, and is portrayed very well throughout, making his arc tragic.8. The soundtrack. Hans Zimmer is one of the best composers in Hollywood, and the score for this film is evidence of that. While the Joker theme puts you on edge, the Harvey Dent theme reflects his character very well also.",9,0,0,18 April 2018
