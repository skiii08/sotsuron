Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An incredibly bad movie
","I don't rate this movie as an awful movie in order to bash it. This movie is simply bad, very bad, very very bad. I guess if that would have been the first of the series, the Star Wars series won't be such a cult. I felt I lost my time. The characters are boring. The bad guys have no charisma and die so fast. Jar Jar binks is probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie history. The pod race is looooooong and never ending. Even the special effects look fake. Well, what there to save the movie ? Seriously nothing... I didn't even want to experiment the following episodes... I might try them someday as I've heard they are not as bad, but don't lose your time with this one.",1,2,6,20 January 2015
