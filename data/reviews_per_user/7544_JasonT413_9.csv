Blade Runner 2049," In The Land Of Prequels & Sequels, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is King.
","What can I say? Did I expect the film to be this good? The previews seemed promising but the film turned out to be a flat out masterpiece, plain and simple. This sequel is to Blade Runner what James Cameron's ALIENS was to the first Alien film, an expansion and possible improvement upon the universe and story of the first film.I won't give much away but Ryan Gosling's performance is perhaps his best ever captured so far on screen. Jared Leto displays an edgy menace which keeps one uncomfortable in their seat every time his character appears on screen. Plus the film has one of the all time evil (synthetic) characters ever put on celluloid in the form of a pretty business-like lady. You'll just have to see the film to see what I am talking about.Be sure to watch the film short entitled Blade Runner 2036 before you tackle the film. It is a perfect lead up to the story and helps one to understand the film better. Plus another short entitled 2048: NOWHERE TO RUN. Enjoy!",10,2,9,7 October 2017
Alien 3," An unfortunate dissapointment
","The long delayed sequel to James Camerons Aliens turned out to be a mediocore affair. I remember going to the local movie theater in my teens to see this film with my brother and I was so dissapointed. It just seemed like an inferiour rehash of the first film. No characters to feel a true sympathy for (though Charles Dance's character gets more depth in the new special edition release). Watching the documentary that comes along with the new re-releae you can plainly see the rough time the producers and writers, etc. had in coming up with a story for the third film. In the end what we got was a brave effort but a failure in comparison with the first two films. The fourth one in the series was a better return to form for me anyway.",6,300,312,25 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than Return of the Jedi
","This is one of my favorite entries in the series, therefore I think it is highly underrated. George Lucas had not directed a film in 20 years when he tackled this and he does an awesome job. The scenes on Tatooine are beautiful. The acting is great, especially Liam Neeson. When his character dies at the end you feel the sense of loss, it's as you have lost your own personal Jedi master. Ewan McGregor is very good just as well. The fighting scenes against the Evil Sith-man are great. This movie was very satisfying in the end and left me in anticipation of the next one. So what's all the fuss about?",9,1,2,19 November 2002
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Hands Down, The best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back
","What can I say?... AMAZING. THE (in capital and neon letters) Star Wars film that upholds that standard of greatness that is associated with the original trilogy, mind you, I Liked the prequels, but yes, they were CGI overload, which frankly did not help their cause but they DID create a rich mythology from which sprang the Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels series and continues on to this day. It was fantastic to see the characters of Bail Organa and Mon Mothma return as played by the same actors whom played them in Lucas' prequel Trilogy. Another wow factor goes to the uncanny portrayal of General Tarkin by Guy Martin. Many high points here and I won't get into anymore. If you are a Star Wars fan, this will restore your faith in the series. The Force Awakens was good, this is GREAT. The perfect lead-in to Star Wars Episode Four.",10,4,10,17 December 2016
Barry Lyndon," Poetry/Art in Motion
",This just might be my favorite film by Mr. Kubrick. While not his most 'universal' it is his most delicately beatiful film. I can see when watching this film how influential it is towards films such as 'Amadeus' and numerous French costume dramas I have seen throughout the years. Abundant scenes of beauty take you to the period the film depicts. Bravo Mr. Kubrick!!!,10,2,3,5 January 2004
The Bourne Identity," Better than Pierce's Brosnan's Bond. Really.
","This film is one of the best spy actioners of recent times. It ranks way better than any of the previous Bond films of the last ten if not twenty years. I very much look forward to the next instillation of this series. Matt Damon is just right and the female lead does a great job, that is Franka Potente. She is great because she has a natural feel to her. Someone like Julia Roberts would have been totally wrong and would have ruined it. Potente gives the role that European touch that only a Euro actor could give to it. Three Cheers to European actors!!!! Anyway, I was suprised how much I liked the film. Check it out!!",8,0,1,8 April 2003
Tropic Thunder," Starts well then painfully stutters along to the finish line
","I was anxious to see this film after it did well at the box office. I am a big Ben Stiller fan and Jack Black is fun as well. The film starts out well enough, Tom Cruise had me fooled until someone pointed out to me that it was him. His character is funny for about 2 minutes then it just grates on and on.............. It's brave to see someone doing a parody of a powerful Jewish Hollywood mogul but the character just becomes annoying after awhile just like Robert Downey's portrayal of his character. Again, funny for about the first half hour of the film then unfunny. The film comes apart for me during and after the POW camp scenes. Save your money on this one.",5,1,3,9 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars comes Full Circle. Lucas is Vindicated. May the Force be with you.
","What can I say? I had not been to the cinema to see a film more than once in about a decade. I experienced this film first on my own and then the following week I took my wife and my 1 year old daughter. This film was a powerful emotional experience for me. The scenes with Anakin and Padme before he turns to the Dark side are beautiful and I was almost moved to tears on more than one occasion. Who says that Lucas is incapable of providing us with deep emotional connections? That is total rubbish. Never once during the entire LORD OF THE RING TRILOGY did I feel such deep emotions linger within me. By the third Lord of the Ring film I was bored to tears. Not so here, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the latest Star Wars series. That's not to say the previous ones were incompetent. Episode I was another great experience when I saw that in the theater about 6 years ago. It is a highly underrated film and I don't think it is a 'kids film'. The fight between Obi-Won/Qui-Jon & Darth Maul ranks among the greatest duels in cinema history in my opinion. Come on, you know I'm right!! And now, in terms of lightsaber action, Revenge of the Sith has topped all the previous films. In this great film we even feel more sympathy than we ever have for the character known as Darth Vader and it is a touch of genius the manner in which Lucas accomplishes it.There is plenty of action AND beauty and sadness in this film. Thank you GEORGE LUCAS for these wonderful films and the time that you have dedicated in making them for us. It has been a sacrifice of your time and energy but believe me I am grateful. You are one of the cinema's heroes in my opinion. Don't listen to the critics (which I'm sure you don't do anyway). Keep your light shining.",10,6,13,10 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I was prepared to hate this film but I enjoyed it. Emotional Experience.
","I came it with mixed feelings for this film not knowing what to expect. The intro was pretty good, introducing the character of Kylo Ren and Oscar Isaac's Pilot for the resistance character. All in all, the intro was handled well, as was the introduction to the female lead Rey. It hit me that this was going to be a good film when Rey and Finn get in the Millennium Falcon and do their thing to get away from a couple of First Order baddies, I got emotional and from then on it was an emotional roller coaster. There are many good things about the film, comparing it to the prequel is unfair, I am one of few who really enjoyed the prequels, and if I have any qualms about this new film is how the lightsaber duels are inferior in quality to the prequels' saber action. A slight bother was how Finn and Rey handle their duels well while basically being novices and never being trained in the Jedi Arts. There is nothing here remotely good as the Phantom Menace's end of film duel or Yoda VS. Count Dooku or anything from Revenge Of The Sith, so to knock the prequels is unfair when you compare to just that one point but I don't want to ramble any longer. It will be interesting to see how the series develops and I am looking forward to Rey's Jedi training and possibly Finn's? And seeing Luke in action as well.",9,1,12,19 December 2015
