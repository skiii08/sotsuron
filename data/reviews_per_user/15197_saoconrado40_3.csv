Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," a leading khazakstani journalist goes to the 'us and a' to make a 'movie film' to 'make learnings' that will benefit the people of his glorious nation
","As a massive fan of Borat from his early days on 'Da Ali G Show', I was eagerly anticipating this movie. Some critics were even going so far as to say it was the 'funniest movie of all time'. Having seen the movie about a week ago, I can indeed confirm that yes, this is a very funny movie that had me laughing uncontrollably at times, however, to keep the concept of Borat going for a solid hour and a half, compared to the usual 2 minute sketches of which we are used to, was surely a very difficult task. The whole Pamela Anderson thing at the end was pretty stupid, I guess with a concept like Borat it is extremely difficult to provide any kind of 'closure' at the end of a move. But some of the jokes were hilarious, particularly when Borat goes to a 'humour' coach and learns 'NOT' jokes, that was probably my favourite part of the film. Unfortunately a lot of it IS rehashed material, for example, his etiquette lessons and dinner has been done before with 'Lady Chelsea' on Ali G. Don't get me wrong, anyone with a sense of humour will definitely find this an entertaining film. I am one of those people with the opinion that the concept of political correctness is one that has spiralled totally out of control, often at the expense of humour, and so I find comedians like Cohen to be a fresh air... he does what most people are too scared to do, and more often than not, he has audiences is in stitches! So whilst I find his humour to be hilarious, I do not recommend Borat out there for those who are easily offended, or 'PC nuts'. You will not like this film. However, if you don't take what he is doing seriously, you will definitely enjoy Borat, even if some of the toilet humour is a bit off. 8 out of 10 stars for me... for your average person, definitely worth seeing!",8,2,7,26 November 2006
American History X," powerful
","I don't want to give too much away to reader's who may not have seen the film, so I won't say much...but if I had to use one word to sum up American History X, it would be 'powerful'. This is the kind of film that is missing in the current film environment that is usually based more around flash than substance, ie special effects and a physically attractive cast are commonly used to win over audiences as opposed to a solid plot containing powerful messages that actually might make you think. I saw this movie last night and it is a fascinating insight into the insecurity of young people and their desire to belong to something, to feel accepted. I believe this theme is equally as prevalent as the denunciation of racism throughout the film. Another thing I liked is that the cast is portrayed as being incredibly human... nobody in this film is 'perfect', as we frequently see in other films. From the protagonist to his young brother to the wise English teacher, they have all had their share of problems in the past, as well as in the present. I think it is a testament to the director and cast that we actually end the film sympathising with a convicted murderer. The moral of the film is that hate is baggage, and we reap what we sew in life. We need to ask ourselves that one question when our lives are veering off course 'Has anything I've done made my life better?'. For the protagonist in American History X, this simple advice is enough to turn around his life from that point on... but it is too late to undo the consequences of his wide-reaching influences, hurting him in the most painful place he ever could have imagined. So once again, this film is sheer power. Certainly it is disturbing in parts, and probably not for young children or the overly sensitive. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic film, truly one of the best of all time. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.",9,0,0,20 December 2006
City of God," Masterpiece
","City of God is a Masterpiece. With all the rubbish that is coming out of Hollywood these days, this Brazilian movie shows that plot and substance will smash CGI special effects any day of the week. Not for the weak of heart, COG is shocking, confronting, and also fascinating. It depicts real life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where the horror of drug warfare is juxtaposed with spectacular scenery and beauty. Unlike the privileged few, the favelados are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and violence, which is almost impossible to escape from. Hollywood could learn more than a thing or two from this movie, it far surpasses any other action movie of the past decade. Simply a must see. 10 out of 10",10,3,6,8 November 2009
