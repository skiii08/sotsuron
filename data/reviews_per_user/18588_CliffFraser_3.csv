Skyfall," Most people like their heroes to be heroes, not has-beens
","I will say at the outset that I was disappointed with this latest Bond offering. I watch around 10 movies a week and have seen every Bond movie in the cinema since No1. For most of the movie Bond plays a less than adequate has-been spy, failing at almost every task, being beaten in almost every tussle. OK so he comes good in the end, despite his proved unworthiness in the fit-for-duty tests. On top of this there were many mistakes including crashing rush hour trains with no one on board, grenades exploding in a dining room without disturbing rows of neatly aligned chairs and a swim in a sub zero lake that would have rendered any human being dead in around 4 minutes. But, for all that, it was entertaining, which is all a movie has to be. Thankfully here in Turkey, a visit to the cinema cost me just $5, so I can't say it wasn't worth the money.",5,4,9,15 November 2012
Spirited Away," Hollywood Animators, Eat Your Hearts Out
","It's some time since I was moved to comment on a movie, but Spirited Away has moved me. I downloaded this movie several weeks ago and noticing that it was an animation I subliminally shelved it. Why? Because for several years I have avoided animated movies emanating from Hollywood. OK, in the early days of computer animation the technology was enough to make the 'new animation' movies interesting. But then, the fact that there was no real story left them with just the technology, which like all things, soon becomes, 'ordinary'. What is missing from all the animated movies I have sampled since is the 'same-ole' animation techniques with overactive characters bouncing around and moving at un-natural speeds. Wow, a seventeen-year-old movie out of 'who knows where' (all the credits are in some far eastern language), that blows all the current animated movies out of the water. In Spirited Away, the attention to detail in every aspect of the story, and there really is a story, is impressive. I will say no more, if you are an enlightened individual, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. More than once. A message for the Hollywood new century Jellyheads, stop basking in the technology, it's just a tool, it's the story and the attention to detail that really matters.",10,0,1,3 January 2018
The Queen," That this movie was made (allowed to be made) at all is a fairly obvious political statement.
","I can understand why the reviewer 'soflwrs' of Brighton, England did not want to comment on the politics of this movie. Nonetheless it seems to me the fact that this movie was made (allowed to be made at all) is a fairly obvious political statement. The role and need for a monarchy was sorely tested during the period of time covered by the film and the final message to me was of yet another patch being applied to an ailing institution. And where did the scriptwriters get their 'royal dialog' from? is it fiction or fact? Pathe News, champions of wartime propaganda, could not have done a better job. As for the title, 'The Queen' this is a little broad for a movie that spans but a minute portion of this Monarchs reign. Actors portraying modern day people never quite works, and with so many in this movie, judging the casting directors choice of actor constantly diverted my attention from the storyline. Despite all that, I found the movie mildly entertaining.",5,2,5,1 February 2007
