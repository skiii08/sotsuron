The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Don't watch the Demi Moore remake
","This beautiful, haunting and mysterious one of a kind movie is one of my favorites. Kieslowski's direction, Jacob's exquisite performance, Preisner's music and Idziak's cinematography give us a film to look, hear, thinkand feel. Maltin gave it a 2 1/2, proving he missed the pointwhile looking for a plot. Clearly an American critic.I see this movie more as a poetic statement on women'ssensibility than a typical movie with a storyline. There's nostoryline. It's full of evocative images that can make you digdeep into your own life. Jacob plays all the emotions withsuch skillfulness, she shines. A real gem. Don't watch it ifyou're depressed. It can make you go very sensitive. Thismovie is so beautiful it made me (almost) cry each of thetwo times I saw it.I recently saw a trailer for the movie 'Passion of Mind' withDemi Moore playing a woman from the US, feeling like shehas another life in France, but she can't distinguish whichone is real and which one is not. Sounds familiar? Yes,they've done it again. They've turned the masterpiece intosummer American popcorn, EXACTLY like they did with Wenders's Wings of Desire (remade as City of Angels). What a shame. Why this one?",Null,3,8,22 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Haunting
","I like this movie because of the atmosphere it creates. Kubrickis a master in creating atmospheres (i.e. watch The Shining).Beautiful cinematography, nice color contrasts, great lighting,etc. Love the pot scene :) It is so funny and well acted. Kidmanis fantastic. Cruise is a bit on the unbelievable side, but OK.(I never bought him as the doctor, less a father (and he is inreal life!). A young De Niro would have done something elsehere, but I'm not complaining! Ok, I know the piano music doesget a little annoying sometimes, but it is very effective. Andwhat about the skinny nude beauties? Where can I get one ofthose? WOW! Overall a flawed, but great movie. Watch it at nightwith pot on your hand :) 8/10",Null,0,1,22 November 2000
