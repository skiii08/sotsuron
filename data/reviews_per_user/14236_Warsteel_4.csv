Stop-Loss," MTV once again brings crap to the stage.
",NOT Worth a Rent. Not even a download. I gotta say I have a few friends who have done tours of IRAQ and pretty much laughed at this entire movie. Especially about the part of the-SURPRISE! stop loss crap. MTV. What can I say. Horrible horrible company continues to push their own political agenda into their BS movies obviously influencing others who can't think on their own or know no better. MTV attempts to make the US ARMY to be a ruthless force filled with tyranny and unfair practices. Avoid this movie if you have half a brain and actually support our soldiers over there. They are doing a tough job and we don't need these damn political agenda movies smearing the image of hard work they have to do.,3,3,6,23 January 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Worth your time
",After seeing all the hype within the trailers I decided I would spend the 7.75 to see this movie...The plot was well detailed and the story actually held me attention throughout the movie.. My only grievence was that some of the action scenes would just not end. If anyone has seen the movie i'm sure you know the one i'm talking about towards the end. I think special effects are being used way to much these days and movies are way to dependent on them. But besides the extreme use of special effects this movie was very well written and worth anyones time. I would rate it a 7 out of 10. Good acting and a well written story add to the overall greatness of this film.....War,Null,0,1,2 September 2003
The Transporter," Average but entertaining
","Just finished watching this movie and I'm not really sure on how I would rate it.  The action was great, but there still seemed like there was something missing.  The plot was pretty weak and I was greatly disappointed to see that the scene in the trailer when Frank deflects the rocket was not included.  Overall I would recommend this movie for people who want to see action and aren't really interested in a great plot. 5/10 is my rating.",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
V for Vendetta," Simply Awful
","Why this movie is given a rating of 8.2 is beyond me. V for vendetta is complete propaganda glorifying terrorism and once again assuring that world that religion is the downfall of the world. The moral of the story quite simply, 'if things don't go your way blow sh*t up.' What amazes me is that the movie actually attempts and does a good job portraying the terrorist as a smart and intelligent human being. I'm sorry but if blowing up parliament at the end of the movie wasn't terribly pointless I really don't know what is... This movie is for those who believe that western society is trash and that it will be the downfall of the world. Seems like more and more of these are popping up.",4,1,4,9 April 2006
