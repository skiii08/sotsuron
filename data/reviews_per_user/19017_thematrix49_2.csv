The Ring," WOW, I Love Being Scared!!
","Great movie, really scary at many scenes. I loved the fast paced nature of the film, as well as the complex investigation factor. Liked the false ending, made the movie much better. So if you like being scared go see this gripping thriller, and don't scream too loud.",8,0,0,19 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Much Anticipated Sequel Is Here At Last!!
","The Matrix Reloaded is another great film from the Wachowski Brothers. There is much more action for all of you buffs out there. The fightings scenes are well done, but also a little over done at times as they seem to be more Computer Generated rather than interesting filming techniques like in the first film. Nevertheless you will probably be amazed be the action. The story is much more complex this time and rather hard to understand. It's fine up until the end when Neo meets and converses with a special someone, but after that your mind will become numb trying to figure it out. All in all this film is great and is worth seeing multiple times, it also leaves you hanging in the end and nicely sets us up for what should be a rather interesting 3rd movie.",7,0,0,15 May 2003
