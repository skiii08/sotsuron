Kill Bill: Vol. 2," different from Volume 1 but alright
","I had mixed reactions to Kill Bill Volume 1 but my reaction to Kill Bill Volume 2 is a great second part of this epic.  I can't give away the details in this movie but after watching this, this is an alright movie.  The scenes were done nicely and the violence were done in a realistic matter this time.  I do like both volumes of Kill Bill because both volumes were done in a spectacular way.If you like Kill Bill volume 1, go see Kill Bill volume 2 because even though volume 2 is different but it still has its style just like the first volume!",Null,0,1,8 August 2004
Scarface," A great film!
","When I saw the movie for the first time, I had a head trip for both of the graphic violent themes and a great story in the film.  The part that got me the most is a refugee from Cuba started this drug empire and then starts falling apart in the end.  Al Pacino playing Tony Montana is bad and brilliant at the same time.  If it wasn't for a great violent mafia movie like scarface, filmmakers will still struggle to push the envelope.",Null,0,1,3 October 2003
Memento," The most mind blowing film I've ever seen.
","Christopher Nolan directed a wonderful film and I was blown away because the whole movie is in reverse which means audiences have to piece this movie together.  The acting performances of Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are perfect for this film.  If you want to see this film, go see it because it is the best mind blowing film to see!",Null,0,2,26 January 2003
We Were Soldiers," It's Horror meets History and I liked It!
","I loved this film.  Even though this film is based on the novel from Harold G. Moore and Joseph L .Galloway, Randal Wallace (person who wrote Pearl Harbor) wrote and directed the film.  It's about Lt. Coloniel Hal Moore (portrayed by Mel Gibson) and other soldiers who have family, wife and kids go to war in Vietnam in 1965.  Hal and the other soldiers were surrounded by about two thousand or so of North Vietnamese soldiers and have to clear them out.  I liked the Hong Kong stylized violent sequences of this film because of the grapic war scenes were in slow motion instead of fast-paced.  We Were Soldiers is dedicated to the soldiers who died in the vietnam war but the bloodbath in this film made it into a resident evil-esque version of the flick 'Pearl Harbor'.  For the horror , gorethirsty and splatter fans, try watching this movie!",Null,1,2,18 March 2002
Blade II," It's back at full force
","The sequel rocked because the fight sequences were awesome and this movie had a plot twist this time.  Wesley Snipes is back as blade which now he kicks the living out of the reapers 'butts' and still bloody, which I don't find it offensive.  Not bad for a sequel!",Null,0,1,29 March 2002
LÃ©on: The Professional," Great film
","This movie is great.  Even though It's Natalie Portman's first film  five years before Star Wars Episode I, I liked how a hitman Leon (Jean Reno) decided to help to track down Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) who is a corrupt DEA agent and his henchmen who killed her family.  Even though I watched the U.S. version of the movie, but it's alright!",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Apocalypse Now," Great movie (redux or not)
","Even though, I didn't watch the 1979 version of the film but I watched the extended version of the film with added scenes.  I find it great because Lt. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is sent to Cambodia to assinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who got paranoid in the Vietnam war killing innocent Vietnamese people thinking that they're one of them.  The villagers in Cambodia made Coloniel Kurtz as a spiritual leader and carrying machine guns and weapons.  It's a remarkable film and you should not leave it ignored!",Null,0,0,18 March 2002
Pearl Harbor," I thought this movie would be good...
","Until I was disappointed on how it's portrayed.  The trauma and grisly scenes were blurred to make it kiddie-friendly ruining the movie and completely similar to Titanic and try to be like it with a love story, people dying without a red mess.  I just can't wait for the Vista series of this film because I heard the violent scenes are untouched and extended a little bit.  I wasted nine bucks last May to see this flick :-(",Null,0,1,18 March 2002
Resident Evil," Intense film
",This movie is intense due to the unusual action sequences in the film.  The fight scenes in the movie are alright and the effects in this film are amazing which I totally liked the film.  You gotta watch this movie because this movie is cool!,Null,0,0,31 July 2002
Saving Private Ryan," The first realistic war movie in years.
",I watched this film on DVD in 1999.  I loved how Spielberg was accurate and my favourite part of the movie was the introductory battle scene at the beginning of the movie because the graphic violent scenes were very realistic and intense due to the fact that many soldiers died by getting shot by or blown up with gruesome results. I like the concept about eight soldiers risking their lives to find Private James Ryan who is the only survivor on the Invasion of D-Day in 1944.  Some find this movie violent but the grisly scenes in this film really happened.,Null,1,2,18 March 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Amazing but Brutal
","I have mixed reactions to this film.  The story lines and the writing are excellent, the performances of Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu are alright.  I liked Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and this film but can people bleed like that having their limbs/heads chopped off? Maybe he's referring to Old school samurai films?  I Don't know.  but I do know this film a completely different film than Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ because of its violent tone but overall Kill Bill Volume 1 is amazing but brutal.  I can't wait to see volume 2.In the end in my humble opinion is that Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 (which I will see volume 2) is ten times better than the Joel Silver produced and Wachowski Brothers written and directed sequels The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions any day, any night, any time, forever!!!",Null,0,1,14 April 2004
Black Hawk Down," wicked movie!
","I love how this film is portrayed because of the realistic visuals of the film that makes it unique.  Unlike Bruckheimer's trying to make 'Pearl Harbor' into a titanic-like scale, I wasn't disappointed due to the fact Ridley Scott directed this film with Jerry Bruckheimer and left the war violent realism in this picture. I was happy the violent scenes were not blurred in this picture and bubble-gummed the violent nature for the little ones because Jerry Bruckheimer made a really good war movie this time!",Null,0,0,21 March 2002
The Last Samurai," Masterpiece Epic!
","This film or should I say epic is a masterpiece.  It's about a civil war captain that travelled to Japan to help its army fight the samurai but end up fighting for their cause but you'll understand when you watch the movie. The performances of Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe were alright, the storyline was great and as for the samurai violence?  is was realistic instead of blood spraying ten feet in the air and the battle scenes is quite realistic too.This film is stylish and serious not stylish and brutal but if you are absoultely 110 percent curious about watching this film, by any means necessary feed it and you'll thank yourself later!!!",Null,1,2,5 May 2004
Enemy at the Gates," Good Film
","I like this film because of how the film is portrayed. I also like the emotions in the film and how performances were so clear but I like the war scenes in this film, really vibrant.  I find it overall, a great film!",Null,0,1,21 March 2002
Casino," really good movie
","This is a really good film since Goodfellas because of the acting performances in the film and the violence in the film was a brutal roller coaster ride which you have to tolerate yourself to see this film. Overall, this is a very good movie and if you are curious, please watch this film!",Null,1,2,19 February 2003
