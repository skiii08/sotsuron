Mission: Impossible III," MI3 Better than the rest
","Excellent! I would say better than the other two.One was great, Two was okay, but three....Three is a must see, edge of your seat, heart racing pure enjoyment.Action, plot twists, a drop of romance, friendship.This has it all.I wasn't sure Philip Seymour Hoffman was a good choice for the bad guy, but I was pleasantly surprised.It was great to see Ving Rhames back. The newcomer's on the team have great personality and are definitely a good fit.Definitely, Definitely go see it.You won't regret it.",9,0,1,9 May 2006
