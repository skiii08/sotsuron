The Blair Witch Project," Home video horror
","Concept for 'Blair Witch Project' sounded very interesting, when I first heard about it: a 'documentary' about kids lost in woods, chased by a scary scary witch. There was lots of talk about this being actual thing that had really happened. Yeah. Right. But funny thing was, that some people really did buy that.So, concept was in order and I even saw this in a theatre with a friend. It wasn't half as good as it was claimed to be. Acting was poor, writing was even worse and direction was non existing. It all was just stuff, that anyone, and I really mean anyone could film with their own home video cameras, as it actually was done with this. The basic difference here is, that someone succeeded in marketing this outside 'Americas Funniest Home Videos'.So in summary, silly kids running around in 'woods' while the scariness factor of the flick runs somewhere between 'Sesame Street' and 'Winnie the Pooh'",3,0,2,11 April 2005
The Avengers," The Avengers
","I guess The Avengers was the movie many Marvel comics fans were expecting. Finally, after a series of solo movies, a group of the fan favourite heroes were united under the Avengers tag: Ironman, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow and that guy with a bow.The would be hero team bickers a bit in the beginning, as they are reluctantly put together to fight Loki, Thor's brother, who is again trying to take on the world. This time with a help of cube thingie called Tesseract, that opens a portal through which a some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conquering.In order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know a lot about the Marvel universe, either from the comics or from the movies, as the Avengers doesn't even pretend to be a movie friendly for new viewers. It's not muddled piece of fan service, but it is filled with things, that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the Marvel universe. The Avengers is fully watchable, even if you don't know that much about Marvel's world, but it does feel a bit hollow experience none the less. It just can't escape from its roots, which have been made during many other movies.As said, The Avengers is not a bad movie. It's filled with great actors from Samuel L. Jackson to Robert Downy JR, almost all of which are familiar from the previous Marvel movies. Thay all do serviceable roles. They make the movie work, but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people, as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them, be it Tony Starks arrogance or Bruce Banners life in shambles caused by his alter ego.All in all, while the Avengeres is not a perfect movie, it is a nice start for a probably a lot more of them. But I doubt any of them will be aimed towards people who don't already know what they are watching.",7,1,3,23 May 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Fulfilling final part of a great movie
","Might contain spoilers So it all ends. Bride's bloody rampage must have it's inevitable conclusion in this sequel of Kill Bill. But this isn't actually a sequel, 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more of an last part of a movie. even tough they both have pretty different atmosphere.Where 'Kill Bill vol.1' was more of an Hong Kong style action flick, 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more of an western/HK flick. Not so bad mixture. Also 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more plot driven than the first, which was one big battle sequence. We get to know characters better in 'Vol, 2' We learn about Bill (Carradine) and his brother Budd (Michael Madsen) We learn about 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman) and Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah). All very capable actors. Oh and watch out for cameo by Samuel L. Jackson.There's also action in the movie, but scenes are not so overblown than they were in the first part, but they do have same unbelievability aspect in them. So no brain usage during action. Might spoil your fun.There's also been debate which one is better, 1 or 2. My conclusion is, that they both are as good, but in little other terms. In all honesty I don't know if i would have liked 'Vol 2' if it would have been entirely similar to first part.It could have made this movie much more boring.I gave this movie same score I gave to 'Kill Bill vol.1', a 8 out of 10",8,0,1,23 January 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A solid sequel to Sherlock Holmes
","Sometimes it happens, that when directors and actors bring forth a new version of well known character they don't always have the guts to go all in, despite it might seem so from the eyes of the purists. This was the case with the first Holmes movie directed by Richie. Sherlock Holmes wasn't a bad movie, but it was somewhat constrained by the heritage of the titular character. The Game Of Shadows is an entirely different matter. In this movie Riche dares to amp up the character to his usual standards, as he already has familiarized himself with it.Robert Downey's Holmes runs like in steroids. He's maniacal, funny, emotional and crazy, but utterly brilliant in his deductions. Jude Law is a perfect contrast for Downey and they share brilliant chemistry, which is so important for Holmes and Watson.The Game Of Shadows is a well cast, railroad action adventure, that dares to take Holmes into another level. In this version Holmes is not as cold and emotionless as he often is portrayed, but more of a eccentric lunatic.In TGOS Moriarty, played nicely by Jared Harris, takes aim to Watson, who is planning his honeymoon with his newly wedded wife Mary (Kelly Reilly). Holmes is on the heels of Moriarty, who is for some reason trying to kill gypsy fortuneteller Simza, Noomi Rapace. This all results into a chase running all over the Europe, while the audience is trying to figure who is the cat and who's the mouse in the game of two brilliant minds.As it is TGOS an entertaining addition to the Holmes series. It's not a traditional portrayal, but then again, that is not even necessary. It's a refreshing portrayal of Holmes, that isn't afraid of being a bit silly from time to time.",8,0,1,21 July 2013
Mission: Impossible III," Solid action film
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is trying to get out of the agent business. He's stopped the field work and started to train new agents, but then something happens. A new agent he has trained gets caught by an international arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), so he decides to go on a mission to retrieve her.The mission doesn't start quite from here, it actually starts near the end, in where Hunt is tied on the chair and Davian is questioning him on the location of 'Rabbitsfoot', a weapon he so greatly desires.M:I3 is quite an entertaining action film, I'd go as far as saying, it's my favorite from the three Cruise movies made. J.J. Abrams does good job as a director and the film never manages to feel like boring action piece. The dialog is good and Hoffman does a great job as the villain.All in all, M:I3 is a solid action film, with some good twists and turns.",7,0,1,22 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst of the saga
","This is it; the definite bottom of Star Wars saga. A rehearsal direction made by Geroge Lucas after being so many years without any directional credits in his name. Also this movie worked as technical test field in CGI animated characters and that is very visible. First of all, there is good things in this movie, such as: Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn), Ewan McGregor (Obi wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padme) and Ian McDiarmid. Other good actors are in too, but because these I mentioned have most of the screen time, I just mention them.Then there is the beginning, I loved it, and I loved couple of other scenes in the middle and the ending. That was good (And I'm not talking about the credits here.)And the music. John Williams is as good as ever. There is no denying that. For these thing is gave my four stars.So, then to dislikes. Jar Jar (Ahmed best). I've always thought that annoying little thief from 'Conan the Destroyer' was annoying character. Jar Jar beats him 1 to 0. Most useless comedic character I've ever seen in my life. Annoying to the bone. Jake Lloyd (Anakin). I know, I know, he's a kid, but kids can act. Haley Joel Osment proved that in 'Sixth Sense'. Lloyd just is on the screen. I don't know is his performance due of sheer lack of acting ability or does Lucas's directing style have something to do with it. Hard to tell.And for last, the pacing of the movie is almost always off. It works in the beginning and during final light saber match, but during those long winded land battles and that god awful pod race scene, pacing and editing is just, well, more off than exploded nuclear plant.So there. And for additional note, I did like 'Attack of The Clones'. It did everything better.",4,3,6,13 March 2005
Sucker Punch," Visually interesting music video
","Sucker Punch is a visually interesting, but structurally flawed music video masked as a motion picture. It has a very light story about a young girl who's been abused by her father and then sent to mental hospital by him so that he could hide his sins. And while the young girl is there, she escapes to wild fantasies, while planning her escape, that make the movie look like its content was collected from several different video games ranging from fantasy feudal Japan to anime inspired sci-fi.And that's the problem with this movie. Znyder could have probably make Sucker Punch a better movie if he'd just had chosen a specific fantasy element to co-exist with the asylum reality, but now the movie is done in such a manner, that the fantasy elements feel too fragmented, despite many of them have bits in them that will most likely make you say 'Well that's neat.' In the end though, simply filling the movie with neat scenes rarely is enough to make the movie an actually good piece. You can't deny Znyders keen visual eye and while movies are a visual medium, visuals are not always enough.",5,1,4,30 November 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Fun adventure
","Great adventurous fun. That's a good phrase to describe 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.You can see it straight from the beginning, that Geroge Lucas had his hands in the making of the movie. The basic storyline has so many similarities with 'Star Wars' . High speed adventures, characters getting in trouble, comedic sidekicks. But there similarities end, world wise I mean. ROTLA is based in late 30ies and obviously 'Star Wars' is not. oh, and director of this movie, like every Indiana Jones flick, is Steven Spielberg.Shortly put, plot is this: Nazi's are looking religious artifact, and now they have their keen little eye on the ark of the covenant. That must be stopped, so U.S. government hires Indiana Jones to find the ark before Nazi's do. so twist and turns and adventure and couple of fights in they way. Harrison Ford is extremely credible as Henry Jones, a professor of archeology by day and adventurous relic hunter by, well every time he's not in front of his class.Karen Allen plays Marion Ravenwood, an old girlfriend of Indy's, now living in Nepal, running a small tavern.Davies Rhys Jones does good, fun part as a more comedic Egyptian digger, who helps Indy in the search of the ark.And lastly Paul Freeman (Belloq) and Ronald Lacy (Major Toht), the two bad guys of the plot, bot seeking the ark for Adolf Hitler.So, if you like fun adventure, this one is for you. I really can recommend it.",9,0,1,28 January 2005
Chinatown," Great Film noir classic
","Chinatown is one of those movies I've always missed when they are shown from the TV, so when I saw a DVD in discount bin I grabbed it and waltzed back home to watch it. It was money well spent.Jack Nicholosn plays J.J. Gittes, a private investigator, who is hired to spy on Hollis Mulwray, played by Darrell Zwerling, to find out, if he's having an affair outside of his marriage. But then it turns out, that Mulwrays wife was an impostor and real Miss's Mulwray, Faye Dunaway, threatens to sue Gittes. Gittes of course wants to clear his name and starts to look for those, who tried to fool him. Then, Hollis is found dead from a river. And the plot thickens.Chinatown is very good Film Noir movie, where people got past thicker than barrel of tar. Line between good and bad is vague and happiness is just a stolen moment between bad things.Roman Polanski does wonderful directing job. Eventough whole movie is full of slow moments, the story itself is not slow. Everything shown just gives more meat on the story and the characters.All actors to their jobs greatly, but John Huston as Noah Cross deserves a special mention. He, besides Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, does really stand out with his excellent performance as Evelyn Mulwrays father.For those, who enjoy good Film Noir story, this should be a treat.",9,0,3,22 February 2005
The Big Lebowski," One of the best comedies I've seen in ages.
","The tale begins, well, not so directly here, when two idiot goons mistake Jeffrey 'the Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) to another man with the same name sans 'the Dude', and take a leak on his carpet, while trying to get him to cough up some dough the other Lebowski's wife is due. From here The Dude finds the other Lebowski, who's a millionaire with a young wife, and demands reconciliation for his rug. Now one thing leads to another and one person stranger than other waltzes into the screen while the Dude tries to figure out what is going on and who's fooling who.The Coen brothers have gathered together a great cast, ranging from Bucemi to Goodman. The script is tight and flows well, the direction is solid and the actors do their damned best as they should. This ends up with one of the funniest comedies I've seen in ages: Witty, surprising, odd and all around plain awesome. There isn't a single actor in the film, that would do a sub par delivery in the story and all the pieces clash nicely together while the bizarre tale of bowling and betrayal unfolds before the viewers eyes.I can't do nothing else but to recommend this, as this is one of those films, that will last time more than a week or two. This is one for the ages.",9,0,1,2 July 2008
Star Trek," Enjoyable sci-fi action
","Trekkies must be fuming from anger: someone has taken their precious Star Trek, which has been for decades their special little play ground, and turned it into something a regular, non canon obsessed person can actually enjoy.It's actually quite brilliant: from a future comes a Romulan villain, who is seeking vengeance upon Spock and other Vulcans. He waits for old Spock (the man from the original series, Leonard Nimoy) to come in the past, so Nero (brilliant Eric Bana) can make him watch the destruction of his home world in the past. This all establishes a time line, that is quite different, yet still similar to the old one.This also give the change to reintroduce all those familiar faces with new actors. James Kirk is played quite nicely by Chris Pine while the role of young Spock has been given Heroes series arch villain Zachary Quinto. It was actually quite a pleasure to see more seasoned portrayal of Nimoy and an role of Quinto, who is still trying to figure out who Spock really is: a human or a Vulcan. And it also was quite nice to see Spock having emotional contact with Uhura (beautiul Zoe Saldana). The rest of the cast is also manned with a great cast, such as Carl Urban as Bones and Winona Ryder as Spock mother.All in all, Star Trek is very enjoyable, reasonably well written and easily the most enjoyable Star Trek movie for people, who aren't very, or not at all, familiar with the original series or previous movies, which always felt like they were directly tailored to a small core audience.",8,0,7,8 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A couple of great scenes
","I would have loved it, if I would be able to say, that Tarantino has made a modern masterpiece with 'Inglourious Basterds'. It has an absolutely stunning opening scene, that introduces us Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a notorious jew hunter for the third Reich.After that we get a much less stunning view of Aldo Reine (Brad Pitt) who is recruiting himself some volunteers to kill him some Nazis in France. It is actually from there the movie slips into a bunch of scenes of which some are less memorable than others, couple of even very good. But not only before the end do we see something that actually manages to get even close of that opening scene.What I am trying to say is, that the movie feels more than once like a narrative mess. Sure, the vengeance story of Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) is very good, but more than once I felt like there was one story too much. Tarantino should have made a movie either about the Basterds or Shosanna. And I felt, that the story of Shosanna was the one he wanted to make, as the scenes including her overshadow almost everything the basterds are in.Despite the narrative disagreements I have with the movie, it is beautifully shot and each frame of it looks really good. The music is okay and the actors are, with a couple of expectations, very well cast.The movie ends in the words 'This might be my masterpiece'. I'm not sure if that is how Tarantino really feels, but at least I don't think it's his finest movie. An okay movie, but not a masterpiece by any means.",7,2,8,25 October 2009
Dawn of the Dead," This time the deaders won't crawl... they run
","You ever had a day, when you wake up in the morning everything starts to go down the drain?. Ana (Sarah Polley) certainly has, when nice little girls rips her husbands throat open and after a furious escape she notices, that the whole city has gone to hell. With growling and running zombies in the every corner.So after some running Ana and policeman Kenneth (Ving Rhames) end up in a mall with some other refugees. There they meet every stereotypical character of any zombie movie, have some great time, shoot zombies from a roof and finally make their doomed escape. And that's all there is to it.There isn't anything original or new to the genre in this film, but there's no real need for that either. The film looks good, actors do great job, and the effects work, well at least most of the time. There are those mandatory who fells for who and other sappy crap moments in the film, but mostly it's just fun zombie flick, that isn't very scary.Snyder has managed to scrape together good apocalyptic action film, that isn't an embarrassment to Romero's original film.",7,0,0,19 May 2007
12 Monkeys," I remember being so scared for that boy...
","Twelve Monkeys is one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It's not one of those idiotic 'bring your huge guns and shoot everything that moves!' movies, but a movie, which makes you think about things, like past and future. Time and sanity.Plot in the peanut shell is this: 1996 a virus wipes out most of the human race. Survivors are forced to life underground, while all other species, immune to the human only virus, take over the surface of the planet. Humans try to discover a cure to this dreadful disease and so they must use time-travel to discover pure form, un-mutated form, of the virus.Cole, Bruce Willis, is a prisoner, who 'volunteers' to take these hazardous trips to locate the pure virus. But when he does go further and further in time he begins to question his own sanity. What is real and what is in my imagination? Also can the time be changed? Can he stop the madman from spreading the virus, or will it all start again? Kathryn Railly, portrayed by Madeleine Stowe, is a psychiatrist, who takes care of Cole in the past, when delirious and confused man is locked up in mental asylum. No one is willing to listen Cole. but then Cole disappears from the locked room.Jeffrey Goines, Prad Pitt, is a son of a millionaire Dr. Goines, Cristopher Plummer, a famous virologist. Cole meets Jeffrey in a asylum, and after Cole escapes he discoverers, that Jeffrey might have his hands in the destruction of human race. Unlike many thinking man movies Twelve Monkeys manages to keep its grip through out the whole movie. That is mostly the asset of Terry Gilliam, who does his absolute best direction job of his career. he manages to keep script tightly in his hands, and so everything that happens in the world of this film seems so logic, even tough things are mostly very surprising.Also the music and acting is superb through the whole film, and it is not wrong to say, that Bruce Willis is in one of his best roles as Cole.My thumbs up.",10,1,2,6 February 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Funniest zombie flick I've seen in ages
","Well okay, maybe not in ages... I do own Braindead and Bad Taste, but still.As you might guess 'Shaun of the Dead' is a member of humorous zombie splatter movie genre. In this particularly bloody, yet humour lazed horror sub genre SOTD isn't the most bloodiest one, that would be Braindead I think, but it does keep you entertained and it does show, that you can actually keep the minor problems with the deaders as a background issue, while the Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to mend his relationship with his girl Liz (Kate Ashfield).The main question in this genre is how well do the jokes interact with the massacre. In this case I may say, that I laughed hard in some places and if not out loud then I managed to get a smirk on my face while watching.The special effects are quite good and while the zombie mask aren't from the most imaginative I've seen they work very well. I believe, that a fans of the genre would find this movie entertaining and I actually think, that even the non fans get a couple of chuckles out of it, as I said, the gore level isn't from the highest end.",8,0,1,30 June 2006
Hostel," Pointless
","Horny Americans, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), backpack the Europe with their new pal Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) in hopes of getting laid and smoking weed. They bump against a lad who promises them heaven of horny women in some Croatian village, so off they go. They take lodgings and a hostel and they soon discover that the lad was right. Pretty naked ladies roam the hostel, but as soon as they get there their friend gets missing. And soon they all find themselves from the hands of sadistic rich bastards who entertain themselves by torturing people to death.As for horror goes this movie is gross and it, without any doubt, is one of the most brutal main stream movies ever made. But where, I ask, is the merit in that? There is no real story. Just some torture and a vengeance. I don't see a real need for this kind of a film, that makes the killings and violence in a pornographic manner (yes, yes... I like Kill Bill's, but in them the violence wasn't serious). You can even say, that 'Hostel' is as much a real movie as are porn films. But the direction is good though, that much I must give for its benefit. Maybe that was the reason I did dislike, and perhaps that was the intention all along, the film that much.But if senseless violence is all you need, well maybe then 'Hostel' is the right film for you. But I am sure that the real mass users of the genre say, that 'Hostel' isn't even the goriest nor most sadistic horror film ever. No one would have heard of the film if director Quentin Tarantino wouldn't have taken special interest about the project. He produced and was the 'presenter' (like the opening titles said) of the film. Oh and if you really want to learn anything out of this movie, then maybe it's 'Stay home' or 'Slovakians... sick puppies all of them.'.",3,0,0,28 June 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A nice addition to the fantasy movie family
","There are two fantasy movie series which Narnia can be compared to and they are, of course, Harry Potter and Lord Of the Rings. Of those two I'd go a bit more towards Potter than LOTR, as the film clearly was aimed towards younger audience than LOTR. But what comes to over all appearance of the film it goes heavily towards LOTR.My opening babbling doesn't mean, that Chornicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe would be a clear copy and mix of the two. The story elements are there: the growth of children to become heroes of Narnia, the fears of children in war. But the execution of the film differs, as Narnia relies on Christian thematics and morals in its story line.I recently read the book before seeing the film, and I can say, that the book is more blatantly religious than the film, tough the main elements are present: daughters of Eve, sons of Adam, Aslan, the Judas theme etc., but they aren't so heavily underlined as they were in the book.The story has gone under some changes, even tough it's pretty faithful to the book in general. It's just the fact, that the book is rather short and some things aren't explained. Lewis had the knack of just skipping some elements and going somewhere else. Now the film begins with raid over Britain, where we see the reason why the kids are sent away from London and the bombings of the German troops. There are some adventurous scenes added in the middle of the story, but other than that the film is pretty accurate display of the book.The most thrilling thing in the film is magnificently made Aslan, voice by Liam Neeson. It's both real and surreal at the same time, just like the other animal characters of the film. But it's the Aslan who stands out the crowd.I was pleasantly surprised with the film, as I didn't expect to like it very much, but I did. I, at first, doubted the length of the film, as the book wasn't that long, but the direction, acting, special effects and over all looks of the film keep the viewer entertained to the end. A solid fantasy film, which will get a sequel very soon if the signs are to be trusted.",8,0,1,26 February 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Is bigger really better?
","When enough is enough? When it gets boring me thinks. South Park the movie is actually rather funny film. I saw it in theatres when it came out and had a blast with my friends. Later we watched it again from video and laughed again, just not as much the first time. I think the key is, that you don't watch it too often, then it keeps its charm. I saw it again recently and I must admit, that I didn't laugh so hard anymore, but it still does have it's bits.SP is, as you might already know, a feature film of a TV-series of same name. This time Kenny, Kyle, Stan and Eric are trying to stop execution of wrongfully accused Canadian comedians Tarrence and Philip, or the literal Hell will break loose, with Saddam Hussein in the lead with his gay lover Satan. In the middle we see these musical acts, laced with profanity.I think, that this movie would have never worked, if it would have been made as a live action film. The paper cutout style, even tough made with CGI, is just the heart and soul of the whole show. Some thing are better left unaltered.Everything gets mocked in the film: handicapped, racism, religions, American moral values, you name it it's probably in the filmSP:BL&U isn't the funniest comedy around, but it's better than most comedies making fun of these same subjects. The question springs in mind, that did Parker and Stone bite too big piece when they made the film, because in some places it feels like lengthened out TV-episode. But luckily pros overweight the cons in this case, so the movie isn't a total failure.",7,0,0,5 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Aw nuts
","'Ice Age: the Meltdown' is a sequel for an animated hit from a couple of years ago, named of course 'Ice Age'. the first IA was energetic comedy full of slapstick comedy about how three very different animals, mammoth Manny (Ray Ramano), saber-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) formed a friendship.CGI animation has come forward a bit from the first film, not that it looks any bit less good than this new one, but the style still is the same. Drama and comedy mixed with a healthy, or unhealthy really depends on how you look at it, dose of slapstick.This time the ice age is about to end and before the flood is gonna hit the valley our friends are in they need to evacuate and fast. On their way out Manny meets another mammoth, Ellie (Queen Latifah), and realises that he ain't the only one left of his species.The biggest problem about IA:tM is that it works better as a bunch of separate jokes than as a feature film. You get laughs out of the jokes and get thrilled with the clever action scenes but when it all comes together the basic plot of the film is pretty non-existing. But that doesn't effect in the entertainment value of the movie.'Ice Age: the Meltdown' is a good sequel for a good movie. After the the end credits all that's is left to say is, that I really wouldn't mind more of this.",7,0,0,2 July 2006
Spider-Man 2," Fun action adventure
","Spider-Man 2 continues from where the first one ended. Peter (Tobey Maguire) is trying to divide his life between real life and his career as a Spider-Man, while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is franticly trying to find out who spider is, so he could wreak his vengeance upon him because of his father Norman, who was the Green Goblin. Meanwhile Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is trying to figure out if Peter is worth the effort and if she should just go on with her own life. And then we have Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) who will turn into Doc Ock after a small mishap.In all Spider 2 is more complete and better rounded up movie than the first one was, because the main players are already introduced and this time they can grow better as characters. Only new character to be introduced really is Dock Ock, which is a part that Molina deliverers very nicely. The script holds together, the acting is good and direction very fitting to the story. Even though Spider-Man has never been my favourite comic hero, this movie does deliver good entertainment and I found it to be good presentation of the hero. It certainly is worth the watch.",8,5,6,23 October 2007
The Fifth Element," One of the best Sci-fi films made in '90's
","I remember when I saw The Fifth Element first time when it came out as video and how dazzling experience it was and how different it were when compared in other Sci-fi films.I found this movie again from DVD sales bin and bought it just from the heck of it and boy, was I amazed how well it still does work for me. I laughed and enjoyed the action. The opera scene is just fantastic.In downsides some of the visual CGI effects have lost their edge, but in the other hand that does not matter, because the world itself in this movie looks like plastic and toys.This movie can be recommended for all, who like nicely flowingSci-fi/comedy action. 9/10",9,0,1,6 February 2004
Batman Returns," Stunning and atmospheric
","In many ways 'Batman Returns' is better movie than Tim Burtons previous 'Batman'. 'Batman' wasn't, in my opinion, fully in the hands of Tim Burton, thus it didn't look so much of a Burton film. It had typical Burton's elements in it, but it wasn't so freely his own. 'Batman Returns' is fully his to the core and that shows.Visually BR is still a stunning piece of cinema. Gothical Gotham city is drawn beautifully in the front of our eyes while Batman (Michael Keaton) battles against the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Of all the Batman movies (I still haven't seen Batman beyond) Batman Returns has the best and most fitting cast. It's hard to give out anyone who wouldn't fit in their roles.There is some plot holes but in Burtons case they don't really matter that much; he's good in hiding those small errors in the over all atmosphere of his films.I've heard that from the some reason hardcore fans of Batman don't appreciate Burtons vision, but as a person who likes Batman I really can recommend this stunning vision to everyone, because it has style beyond typical comic book adaptations and it really shows what a talented director can make out of a well known character if just given free hands.",8,1,2,25 June 2005
Alexander," Shoddy work
","Alexander has all the element of a great epic movie. It has massive battles, beautiful locations and re-created cities from the past. That's why it's rather disappointing, that the film is ruined whit poor editing and shattered narration.Biggest flaw of the film is, that it's really hard to identify with anyone: all characters just drift along the given time scape whit only definitive center point of Alexanders world conquest. Then there's the build up of tension of the story which is strangely enough done in very late part of the movie, which is far too late, when placed in the context of the movie's length. The movie cost 150 million dollars or so. It shows in the massive scenes, but then there are some scene, which look poorly and shoddily made. Most of the scenes with Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) look extremely fake. Also some of the CGI'ed camera drives on the battle fields are ridden with such problems. And speaking of battles, some of the scenes are rather fuzzy, so it's sometimes hard to tell what's going on.I did find it strange, that all the characters spoke with poorly selected accents, as they didn't serve any bigger purpose and sounded rather awkward. It wouldn't have mattered if EVERYONE would have used a accent, but there was lots of characters who didn't use an accent or used different accent even though they were from the same place as the others.My final nail to the review: Music. Sure, I like Vangelis. I have Blade Runner soundtrack. But Alexander's soundtrack is very unfit for the film. It mostly creates wrong atmosphere for the situations.There are some great scenes in the film, but as I said it felt shoddily done and, I even dare to say, in some places it was quite amateurish. And that was pretty odd.",5,3,4,27 November 2005
Constantine," Holy shotgun, Constantine-man!
","I have never really gotten into the world of Constantine despite the fact, that it has stories in it written by some of my favourite comic book writers. The character hasn't never really interested me enough, though it does hover around matters which I personally find appealing. That's why I really didn't have any expectations of this film.It has parts in it I liked and parts I didn't like. The character of Constantine is, as far I know, pretty faithful to the original with the exception of that originally he's a Brit, who looks like Sting. And he's not so much of an action man. The world comics are set in and the world that the movie has seem pretty similar to me. But as I said I am not an expert on this matter, so I am sure, that the people who actually have read more than a couple of Hellblazer comics will beg to differ.So let's tackle it shall we? John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a modern day wizard, who battles against the daemons of hell to make amends in order to gain back his place in heaven. He finds out that certain parties are trying to get son of Satan on earth. He gets help from a police Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who's dead twin sister seems to have something to do with the case. I am sure you'll fill in the blanks.The plot is clichéd as heck. Nothing in the movie comes as a surprise and the 'surprise plot twist' are so old, that even a blind could see them coming from far. That actually wouldn't be a problem, as I actually liked the visual appearance of the film, but the direction was very lacking: it seemed to lack enough tensity to keep me on the edge of my seat.As I said, I liked the visual appearance of the film. There are some pretty nice SFX in there, but sadly the cons do win over the pros here. Constantine is not biggest piece of garbage in the comic book movie genre, far from it, but spectacular or memorable film it isn't. Which is a kind of a shame really.",6,1,2,21 September 2006
Troy," Moderate epic
","Last Wolfgang Petersen movie I liked was 'Never Ending Story'. And now I've found another.I remember critics where little unsure what to make of this Greek epic without gods. Others liked it, others disliked it, I found it very entertaining, yet little bit too long epic, with a punch of great acting and some little less not so good acting.From the actors I have to bring up Eric Bana, whose performance as Hector is above all other young heroes. Brad Pitt is not bad either, but he's been a lot better and in some places he seems a bit lost in the middle of this movie.What comes to Orlando Bloom, well, he still doesn't convince me with his acting skills. Legolas still seems to haunt his career. 'Lord Of The Rings' is still the only movie he did fit in perfectly.I cannot claim myself to be a scholar of Greek mythology, and so I don't know how much has been left out, besides the gods, and what has been changed and how much, but as adaptations go, this is very good one. I give 'Troy' a solid 7 from good effort.",7,5,10,7 December 2004
Terminator Salvation," In almost every count, mediocre
","I liked Terminator 3. it was a fun action flick with some pretty nice action despite it was, well, a bit brainless. And action wise I liked McG's Charlies Angels movies as well despite they were even more brainless. So that in mind I don't have any reason to desperately hate Terminator Salavation as some hardcore James Cameron fans do.So good things first. The special effects are good. The big robots, the small robots, flying and swimming robots look vicious and deadly. And that's it I think. Oh, the main cast does good with the material they're given. It always amazes me when actors can give even the most silliest lines with a serious face.McG doesn't manage to get the movie going at any point of the story. Action scenes, while good looking, lack intensity and feel like they are out of steam. Then there's too many 'close calls' for the main characters and that too gets boring quite quickly as well the fact, that I hardly connected to any of the characters.Maybe it was the script or maybe it's McG's skills, I don't know. The whole movie felt like the makers didn't really know what they were doing with the material they had. The tone of the movie was very matter of fact serious, but it is filled with scenes that feel a bit goofy, despite they didn't make me laugh. They just feel odd in the mix, as if they had taken certain things just a bit further they'd made a flat out parody.I can't really recommend T:S, but it's not the worst movie I've seen in my life.",5,0,1,29 January 2010
Insomnia," It's the guilt that drives us
","Two detectives come to little, remote Alaskan village to look into a bizarre murder of a young girl. Both of the detectives are a bit on the edge, as they both know back in home there's a internal investigation waiting for both of them. On the top of that Dormer (Al Pacino () is trying his best to fight against insomnia, caused by the never descending summer sun of the northern hemisphere. Or maybe it is guilt that keeps knocking in the back of his mind, that keeps him awake.The things escalate, when Dormer accidentally shoots his partner Eckhart (Martin Donovan) and tries to pin the blame on the killer they are chasing. Only one who sees holes in his story is the young detective Burr (Hillary Swank), who struggles between exposing the truth and admiration towards her older colleague.The guilt. That is the main word here. We all are guilty of something, but of what. And what are we willing to do to cover that guilt and how severe are the thing we are guilty of. Also, there's a moral in the story, which goes, that only way to get rid of they guilt is to do the right thing, even if might cause a storm after wards.Christopher Nolan does a steady job helming this film. The feeling is paranoid and atmosphere is grim and menacing. But it also is quite clear from the get go, that the things are gonna explode and the sins are gonna get revealed at the end. Robin Williams does a good, yet predictable role as the killer, who has had his killer instinct woken up and the final outcome of the film can be seen coming from a far distance. But in the end, a solid cast and a good direction do bring the film from mediocre to good, so I'd recommend it for the fans of good noir yarns.",7,0,0,18 June 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Holy CGI spectacle, Sparrowman.
","There will be a sequel. If the movie does well in the box office that is, and I have no doubt that it wouldn't do otherwise.Now that that's said, lets tackle the bad things first: it's too damn long. Literally you they could have trimmed at least 20 or 30 minutes out of the film and it would have been a much tighter and better paced film. And the script ain't as epic as the length tries to make the watcher believe.Now that that's been said, let me say, that here be an entertaining piece of piratey celluloid. The huge sea battles are done with a huge amount of money and it shows. Ships blow up, ugly creatures pop out from every corner of the earth and so on and so worth, what I be saying here matey, that the sfx are half of this here film, and with out those there would not be a story... at least not as long one. To come to think of it, with out modern CGI wizardry this would have been about 2 hour film, maybe less.The plot includes a lot of twists and turns, in one point there's a huge race of who's betraying who and in the end, which was drawn far too long, this coming from a man, who thinks LOTR: Return of The King has a perfect ending, might says a lot. I felt it should have ended much earlier than it did, but no... they had to lay the basis for the next possible film, like that wasn't already done.So in short, it's a good film, perhaps a bit too long, but in the end very satisfying experience.",7,6,20,23 May 2007
Zodiac," Good thriller
","I don't know a thing about the Zodiac case and in fact I hadn't even heard of the Zodiac killer before this movie, mainly because I'm not from the U.S. So given that, I could watch Fincher's 'Zodiac' without much of bias in one direction or another, and for what it is worth, I quite enjoyed this chase of a killer, whose real identity was never confirmed to an absolute fact.'Zodiac' is more of a story about obsessions and what it can do to a person, than a study of a serial killer. This is mainly because the real killer was in reality left unproven, so the movie follows more of the investigators and Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) than the prime subject of the case Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch).The story is mainly well written and Fincher's direction is always good, which helps to forgive some scenes, that don't seem to serve much of a purpose in the larger scale. All in all, a good, yet not superb, serial killer mystery.",8,0,1,28 March 2009
The Terminator," Action classic
","Ultimately there is only one thing that prevents me giving higher score for 'The Terminator': the soundtrack. There was lots and lots of synthesized music back in 80's and from some reason James Cameron decided to be cool and hip and he wanted one in his film. Which I think was a mistake and I am really hoping, that Cameron would do a special edition with some better tracks. Now, there are some good tracks on the film, but mostly all action sequences are plagued with those horrible synthesized music tracks.Now that I've gotten that out from my chest I can say here, that otherwise I like the film: it's greatly directed and written. Actors are good and special effects are rather good for their age.A solid action goodness from the flashy 80's. A classic.",8,0,1,6 June 2005
Cloverfield," It's all about the monster
","It took me some time to finally see Cloverfield despite it was pretty hyped movie when it originally came out. The reason was, I really didn't like the style that was shown in the trailers. And now, after seeing it, I still don't like the style, but the movie has aspects in it, that makes some of it a fun watch. Though, I did find the movie a bit boring, despite it was trying so hard to be frantic and portray a feeling of a great urgency. And that isn't a good thing, as the movie isn't that long either.The scenes I'm talking here are of course the scenes of destruction and pretty much everything the monster of the movie has a bigger part in. The destruction of Manhattan is fantastically done and the monster itself is just glorious, even in the close shots it looks stunningly real. The monster is the real star of the movie and the way it has been executed manages to save a lot in this story. While it's a good thing the movie wasn't centered around some standard gun ho military personnel trying to kill the beast, I didn't warm up to the pretty forced plot line of good bye party turned into a rescue mission of one true love.The actors are surprisingly pretty good, but honestly, this movie works only because there's a huge monster mashing things around.",6,1,3,19 June 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Gothic fairytale
","If someone would ask me a good movie to introduce himself on the works of Tim Burton I would suggest him either 'Edward Sciccorhands' or this, because they both have so similar atmosphere and they show Burton doing something he's good at: Gothic fairytale for adults.'Sleepy Hollow' is stylish Gothic tale of a young inspector Ichiabod Crane (who else than Johnny Depp), who is sent to a remote village of Sleepy Hollow to find a culprit, who has decapitated 4 of the god fearing towns folk. When he arrives he learns, that the villagers believe the murderer to be no else than the Hessian Horsman (Chirstopher Walken), whose headless ghost has rose from the Hell to claim the heads of all who foolishly happen on his path. Crane's modern thinking is put to test after he learns that the case is in fact so and together with a son of one the victims Masbath (Marc Pickering) and lovely Katrina (Christina Ricci) he begins the search of the one, who has summoned the horrid hell spawn.'Sleepy Hollow' is from the better side of Tim Burtons movies: it's visually stunning, the music by his court composer Danny Elfman fits in and brings out incredible atmosphere and the actors are doing their parts all around nicely. But if you want to pick something, then the take the script, as it does indeed leave some room for improvement and there are some minor plot holes, but then again this movie isn't meant to be looked so seriously from that direction, as the plot does work in the scale it is meant to work: a fantastic, grim fairytale.",8,1,2,30 September 2006
We Were Soldiers," Dudley do right's
","This isn't, in terms of patriotism, as bad as Mel Gibson's 'patriot', but it still far, far , far too patriotic movie for me.Sure, I don't have anything against war movies. But I have something against flag waving, gun tooting patriotic scripts and this movie sure as heck has one. In that sense you might guess, that I don't like that many war movies. I do, but only those, which wont stuff patriotic ideals in to your face. Well okay, Mel Gibson is this military superman, who does everything for his men. Yippiekayee. Then they go in Vietnam and they are surrounded by Vietcong's. And lot's of shooting, dying and crying housewife's are shown, when they get the message. Very sappy, emotional wannabe stuff here.And Vietkongs running, but never shooting. Or missing their targets by a mile. Oh yeah, some action looks good tough. Nothing wrong in that department.Nothing special about this flick. Very standard stuff.",4,1,8,17 March 2005
The Adventures of Tintin," Well I'll be damned, it's actually a good yarn
","I've never been the biggest fan of Tintin. For me his character has always been a bit too bland, while his adventures have been entertaining enough. But out of Franco-Belgian comics I've always preferred Lucky Luke and Asterix before Herge's comics. So with that I went to see Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson co production and Spielberg directed Tintin movie. And what a blast it was.Firts of, as you might know, the movie is done with mo-capped CGI animation. Every previous endeavor at the field have been a mishmash of pretty pictures, but eerily human like and appalling characters. Not this time around. WETA uses all the tricks they've learned in doing movie effects like in Cameron's Avatar. They've pulled out all their cannons and they deliver a visual blast of unmatched animation and scenery. On a very few fleeing moments there's that feeling of unsettling eeriness present on a couple of minor characters, but I do dare to say that all the main characters and the majority of the side characters leave that feeling far behind and in many moments you just forget, that you are watching a CGI creations facial movements, as the emotion is fully present in every expression and the eyes steam of life.The story of the movie revolves around captain Haddocks lost family fortune and villains, who are trying to take his rightful heritage away from him. Tintin stumbles upon this by an accident, when he purchases a miniature of a galley Unicorn. Sure enough, there are some holes in the plot, but Spielberg drives the plot forward with such an enthusiasm, that it is easy to forgive a hole or two, especially when we are treated with great deal of visually splendid action and humour. This all is lazed nicely with a soundtrack of John Williams. Over all the atmosphere is straight from old adventure movies, which dared to be fun instead of foreboding and gloomy.Voice cast does a good overall work as well. Andy Serkis is good as Haddock and Pegg and Frost do a good job as Dupont & Dupond (or Thompson and Thomson, how ever you want it). Bell manages to breath some life in Tintin as well and over all he's a bit more rounded up as a character in the movie than he ever was in the comics. It's perhaps the facial expression, which are a bit more telling in the movie that they ever were in the Herge's images.Also, what was a pleasant surprise, the character traits of Haddock have not been sacrificed in the altar PC culture, as he still is the same cursing drunkard as he is the books. Dupont and Dupond are the same incompetent detectives and Tintin is smart as ever while Milou, Tintins dog, stays as his loyal friend and edgier alter ego.The 3D works nicely on the movie. It's not necessary for the movie, but it's not distracting either, it's merely there to give some depth to the picture so it's not necessarily worth the extra price.All I can say is, that the more I think about it, the more I can recommend it.",7,1,4,13 November 2011
Alien," It just keeps getting better and better
","We see a huge ship flying through space. Inside we see helmets placed on the cockpits chairs, when the computers turn on. We see reflections of the data from the visors of the helmets, when the automated procedures wake up the the crew of seven.The opening scene has burned itself into my mind. It has been there since I saw the film for the first time as a kid aged of six or so. From some reason I thought that scene was a bit scary back then. Even though I don't think the opening as scary anymore, I still do think it's a great way to open a story.Ridcley Scott manages to serve a visually and stylistically stunning movie, the best movie of the Alien franchise. From the design of Nostromo to the derelict ship of the space jockeys, we see solid design all around. H.R. Gigers alien design is, well from the lack of a better word, so alien, yet so familiar, that it stays to haunt you in the back of your mind. A hunter, whose only priority is to survive and ensure the survival of the species.It's very difficult to try and pin point a weak link from the film. There may be one or two inconstancy's in the story and a couple of special effects may look like they were done in the late 70's, but the thing is, that the film and the effects have taken the test of time very well. This is a movie with deep shadows and alien sounds. This is a story, that dives deeper inside your psyche than you even realize. And it gets better each time you watch it.",9,0,1,25 July 2007
Interstellar," Nolan's ultimate trip.
","In the future world is in a brink death. Slowly the arable land is turning into a dust bowl, ridden with plant killing diseases. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot is farming corn, just like everyone else. Peple are too busy to survive and everything else is forgotten. And then Coopers daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) convinces him that a 'ghost' in her room is real and it is trying to communicate with them. This anomaly leads Cooper to a NASA project, which is aiming to explorer an another galaxy, which can be accessed via a wormhole.In Interstellar Christopher Nolan tries, and at times succeeds, to take notes from Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey. Where Kubrick looked at themes of evolution of mankind, Nolan is trying to aim his scope on the survival of the species, and in some points the possible evolution as well. Though Interstellar is, albeit scientifically a bit top heavy, much easier movie to approach, as it has stronger human element in it than 2001 has.I'm not proclaiming Interstellar to be a similar classic as Kubrick's masterpiece is. At times it comes close, but most of the time it resembles more of the sequel of 2001, 2010, which isn't a bad movie either, just not as strong as its predecessor. Interstellar is better movie than 2010 is though.Nolan is handling grand themes in his movie. Grander and more abstract than he ever has. The themes themselves are at places so big, that they swallow the actors, making them to be just backdrops to the next of those concepts. But will this be the next ultimate trip only time will tell.",7,2,7,9 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," War. Ain't it hell?
","I was thinking of naming my review as 'Morality of man' or something else pseudo intellectual like that, but then again the movie itself has a perfect line to describe itself, right on the scene when a helicopter gunner is shooting running women in the rice field and Joker (Matthew Modine) asks if how can he kill women and children. Then man answers something in line 'You just gotta aim lower. War, ain't it hell?'.Full Metal Jacket is clearly an antiwar statement. It doesn't portray war as noble, nor does it do that to the soldiers either. There's no sugarcoating in the portraying of what the soldiers do: they kill. War is something, that brings out the worst in each man, no matter how good you think you are, you will change for the rest of your life. After all, the soldiers really don't win, they loose no matter which side wins.FMJ is clearly divided in two parts, in three if you count in the part, in which Joker goes to the field to do his war reporting. The first part shows how the boys are turned into killing machines, who feel no pity. This first part is the battle between Gunnery sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Eremy) and private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is a bit slow man, who keeps ending in trouble because of that and his obesity. This boils down to the disciplinary action taken by the rest of the privates, who are fed up being punished of his doings. There is no mercy. But it will get more merciless, just in a bigger scale.The second part is the Vietnam. Joker is assigned to war press and soon he is sent to do reports from the field. This is the turning point for him, as he finally realises what it all is about. Hardcore, as his team mates say, when he fires a bullet in the head of a wounded sniper. Killing someone up close is harder than doing that from a chopper, where you don't see they fearful eyes of the one you are going to kill.Full Metal Jacket is basically two movies in one. Lesser director than Kubrick would have done only one half and ended there, but Kubrick shows what happens after the graduation. It's not just hardcore training done by sergeant Hartman, it's the end results of that training as well. But in the end, no matter how hardcore you are, no matter how you were trained, you will be scared when looking in the barrel. You are scared and you just want to get away.Even though FMJ is one of the best war movies I've seen, there still is a couple of segments and couple of things I don't like about it. But those things are just personal things, nothing that will change the fact, that this is a good movie. For instance I didn't like the way Modine delivered his narrative lines, but in the end it doesn't take away a thing of the solidity of the movie. The other problem is, that I don't feel the Vietnam part is tight enough. When compared to the training part, Vietnam is full of air, but then again Kubrick was trying to portray how it wasn't all action, there was serenity as well, be it that came from between the thighs of a Vietnamese hooker.For a summary Full Metal Jacket is a great war movie. It is the one people should really see.",8,0,2,17 December 2007
Pacific Rim," Silly yet entertaining
","Pacific Rim is kind of a silly movie. It's heavily influenced by Japanise monster anime, where huge robots beat the sense out of equally huge monsters. That is not a genre I am a huge fan of, as the ones I've seen tend to be a bit overly melodramatic and in that Pacific Rim also does dwell its own share. When all is said and done though, Pacific Rim does manage to be an entertaining, albeit very predictable movie about how underdogs finally manage to beat the odds and save the humanity.The plot of the movie isn't anything spectacular, it's merely an excuse to show as many robot/monster battles possible. The characters are equally uninteresting archetypes with nothing interesting to offer and the only thing the movie works is, that the battles do look pretty damn good. Guillermo Del Toro directs with a steady hand and has made the action sequences both entertaining and easy to the eye.Del Toro's direction saves quite a bit in the movie. If he'd be a poorer director, the movie would be borderline unwatchable, but he manages to keep the strings nicely in his hands. PR isn't a masterpiece of cinema by any means, but it works reasonably well for what it is: a movie about huge robots pummeling monsters.",7,0,2,27 September 2014
The Devil Wears Prada," Nothing original, nothing new
","A young girl, a job to pay the rent, the change, the friends who detest the change and the realisation what is the right thing for her life. Not very original story by any means. There was this, seen this before feeling I had through out the whole movie, when I watched it. Don't take wrong though, it's a nice little film. Direction is good enough, the script is good and the actors do their work as they should.There has been a lot of praise towards Meryl Streep in this film, and you can't deny, if she weren't a talented actress. But the thing is, like it is for all 'villains' in the films, the story isn't about her. It's about this young, naive girl played by Anne Hathaway, and her friends and life, which is actually left as a background noise. In the end, her life outside the jobs pressure is just a flat piece of paper, with people with make up personalities.But for what it's worth, this movie flows with ease, even though you can guess the plot in the exact moment the film starts. It delivers no surprises nor twist, but then again, it's not the worst example of stories of its genre.In short, it's reasonably good waste of time.",6,8,10,17 September 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Mostly entertaining
","If you listen to some fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, the new one is crap. This is, I've found out, true only with the Phantom Menace, which was very poorly directed and edited piece of film.Attack of the Clones in the other hand is in comparison a superior achievement from PM. But it does contain couple of unnecessary segments, which drag the speed of the film down. And some of the acting is, even in the standard of the Star Wars, pretty horrible. But happily all those under achievers are not in any important roles and seasoned actors like Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) do deliver what you expect of them. others deserving nomination here are Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine.So, the plot. Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are told to watch over senator Padame (Natalie Portman) because of assassination attempts towards her life. This soon leads in Obi in discovery of secretly manufactured clone army. Who is behind all this? Will Padame and Anakin fall in love? When does Anakin fall in to the dark side? Will he become a Jedi before all this? Some of these questions are partly answered in AOTC, but some are left waiting for the third installment of the new trilogy.But as said, this is much better film than Phantom Menace. It's not best film in the Star Wars saga, but in my opinion it does deliver. It's mostly fun to watch, action sequences are good, special effects are even better and despise some bad acting and some pretty horrible dialogs, it wasn't pain in the back side to watch.So, my advise: don't listen to roaring Star Wars fans who claim this movie to be one of the worst things ever and don't listen to those, who claim this one to be best thing since sliced bread.Attack of the Clones is above average, but not the greatest thing ever either.",7,131,233,22 February 2005
Corpse Bride," Charming, stylish animation
","Sometimes you find a film, in which everything seems to click together like a finely made clockwork. When you locate such a gem you can't help but to be mesmerized of how well everything works out. Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' is such a film, starting from beautiful art direction to settings and music.It all begins when Victor (Jhonny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson) are to be wed. The thing is they'we never met each other, as their parents have arranged the union, Victors parents in order to get into nobility and Victorias parents in order to get rid of their money problems. The wedding rehearsal goes awry, when Victor stutters with his weddings vows, as he's not fully certain if he really wants to marry, and he's sent to memorise his part of the ceremony. In the woods he tries to get his lines in order and he slips his ring on a tree branch, which turns out to be a bony finger of a corpse bride (Helena Bonham Carter), who is delighted to accept his accidental proposal. Now Victor, who has realised he does want to marry Victoria, has to wiggle himself out of his new ghastly marriage.As I said everything clicks together very nicely in this little musical horror comedy. Despite such a grim premises for a love story 'Corpse Bride' rises above being just scary, on the contrary it plays out very charming manner and the love story that motors it is quite beautiful as are the settings. The dolls, or puppets, are finely made and so expressive, that it is easy to forget that you are watching a stop motion animation. The film is crowned with Danny Elfmans spectacular sound track, that brings the atmosphere in entirely different level.All in all, a spectacular animation. My sincere recommendation.",10,0,0,4 July 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," A bland part of MCU
","Captain America was a movie I tried to like and that is always a bad sign. I didn't try to like it because I'm a Marvel fan, I tried to like it because among the relatively similar mass of Marvel movies it looked like it could be something different, being set during the WW2 and all. But in the end Captain America is just another movie in the cookie cutter style every other Marvel movie is. It has action, it has humor, it has heroes and it has villains. And in this formula it's also bland and unexciting despite all the big action scenes it has going on for it.Those big action scenes might actually be a big part on why the movies does feel bland, at it really doesn't give out the feeling that there's something at stake during it. Sure, there's Red Skull trying to gain the godly powers, but it never really feels very menacing, as the plot itself feels very thin. Instead of more action, the movie could have used more character development, as now people, AKA the good guys, we should be rooting for to stay alive, don't feel that important, nor do the plans of the evil villain either.I guess if you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America will work for you. But if you're not you might come into the same conclusion, that the movie is missing something integral.",5,1,2,14 June 2015
Fargo," What more is there?
","Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two goons, Carl Showalter (Steve Bucemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to stage a kidnapping of his wife in order to steal a heap of money from his rich father in law Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). After the things get a bloody twist in a shape of a dead highway officer, officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) begins to unravel the case. And this is where I have to stop talking about the plot, as it would really ruin the film.Frances McDormand does a stellar job as Marge, who is trying to understand the case and is in a place in her own life, that has made her to wonder where it all will lead. She's a head of her own police department, pregnant and steadily married, but still she seems to wonder, if there might be something else out there. It's hard to say a bad thing about the rest of the cast either. Coens have done a great job in gathering a great cast and the film flows along withing its own logic, and never breaks it. The illusion stays intact to the end and you never question, at lest during watching the movie, why things go the way they go.",8,0,0,7 May 2008
Predator," Solid, solid action, even todays standards.
","This is, after the Conan The Barbarian, my second favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick: it's mean, brutal, well directed, and even given the macho feel of the film, well acted.So the plot goes, that this special ops squad is sent in to the jungle to rescue some government officials. But then it all turns to hell: a hunter from outer space, this thing called predator, starts to hunt the men of the squadron. Rescue mission turns into a bloody battle of survival.Predator is dated extremely well, when you take in consideration the year it was made. Most action films made in the 80's, like Terminator (I know there are several who disagree but it's my opinion), look and sound pretty cheesy today, but even the musical score of the film sounds great today. It could be said, that you can watch the film, and you don't even have to feel nostalgic about it to think it's good, solid piece of testosterone action (and in some points little bit of horror as well).I give my thumbs up for this one, Predator is probably John McTiernan's best movie to date.",8,0,1,18 September 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The beginning
","I am a fan of the book. I admit it right here in the beginning. I have also been waiting for someone to turn the books into a movie or movies since I first time saw incomplete animation by Ralph Bakshi.Then some years ago I began to hear rumours, that a director from New Zealand, Peter Jackson was about to take on this task. The name wasn't unfamiliar to me: I had seen his previous movies, Brain Dead, Bad Taste and The Frighteners. I didn't know what to think. I did like the movies, but then again he was a splatter movie expert, not fantasy.Then I watched them again, and I saw the visual tricks and camera usage he had achieved in those little films and I became more confident. The subtle fantasy elements in Brain Dead convinced me of his abilities. But still, I was little afraid: could he pull it off?Then, sometime later, after hours of studying rumours and leaked photos in internet I and my friend finally got our hands wrapped around the tickets, tickets to get us in one of the first viewings after the premiere around here where I live. My throat was dry and I was anxious to see the final product.Couple of hours later my friend and I left the theatre mesmerized. It had been more than we expected, light years above anything we'd seen before on the screen. We spent hours talking about the experience and we came in conclusion, that if the quality of the first film were a promise from things to come there wouldn't be anything to worry about.Besides of the stunning cinematography, music and special effects there are amazing actor performances seen all over the film: Ian McKellen as Gandalf, a wise old wizard who is leading the fellowship through perilous journey. Sean Bean as Boromir, son of Denethor, steward of Gonodr. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, corrupted head of the wizard's council. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, son of Gloin, a dwarfish warrior. Billy Boyd as Pippin and Dominc Monaghan as Merry, two loyal friends of Frodo (Elijah Wood), and Samwise (Sean Astin).Only two actors I didn't immediately fell for were Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, or Strider if you will, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. There wasn't anything specific in Bloom's case; the part just wasn't a huge acting part, mainly just looking pretty. In Mortensen case I was little bit distracted by his, perhaps little too calm at first, portrayal of Aragorn. But I got over it.The special extended edition didn't bring anything crucial to the movie, just some scenes adding more depth to the story, like the journey of the elves, where Frodo and Sam see the elves travelling in the forest, going towards the Grey Havens, in order to leave the Middle Earth.Fellowship of The Rings was and is extremely good start for the one of the most stunning trilogies of the movie history.",10,5,9,22 May 2005
Man of Steel," A Man of Steel
","Low expectations. That's what I had when I started to watch Man Of Steel. The movie already had two things against it: I'm not a huge Superman fan, as I mostly find his boy scout character dull and Znyder isn't that strong of a director. So color me surprised, Man of Steel is, and I know this is a blasphemous thing to say, the best Superman movie I've seen.In MoS Clark is just beginning to become the hero we know. The world finally finds out about Superman when Zod comes to Earth, looking for a codex containing the salvation of Krypton, the destroyed home plant of Clark, Zod and the small rag tag group of Kryptonian prisoners from a Phantom Zone.There's a lot to like about MoS. First of the special effects look great. And secondly, there's a lot of good actors in the movie, who give out pretty nice performances considering how inherently silly the whole movie is despite all the muted colors and dramatic music by Zimmer. Yes, there's a lot about MoS which could have turned the whole movie into an unintentional camp fest, but it never does. Some how Znyder has managed to churn out a movie about modern gods with out making it look silly. Instead the movie is exhilarating.For the first time in a long, long time, I believed in Superman. I rooted for him, despite I knew he is absurdly strong. A man of steel. A man, who is almost impossible to hurt, unless you hurt something he loves.",8,3,5,3 May 2014
Cast Away," Little lacking criticism of modern life
","Man alone in in a deserted island. Robinson Crusoe springs in mind, when watching this movie, it's just modernized version from it. And Friday is replaced with a volleyball.In the end whole movie is hanging in the shoulders of one man, Tom Hanks. And he is good, he actually shows very well in this movie why he is considered to be great actor; he's as believable as anyone can be as a marooned man. He talks to his imaginary friend, Wilson the Volleyball, he creates fire and utensils to do fishing. He loses weight and gains more wisdom in survival.But, it all is a little bit of boring, he is there alone. It's just a one man, trying to fill the whole film with his isolated survival. Of course he gets out from the island and his readjustment to society is quickly recorded, but it isn't given much of thought. He just visits his ex-girlfriend (Helen hunt) and the he continues his living, trying to figure out which way he want's to take with his life.As a movie everyone must have known how risky it was. It's not filled with action or sexy women. It depends on it's critical elements towards todays electronic dependant society: less can be more, we need a human touch. As for now 'Cast Away' is too long, Robert Zemeckis has left some unnecessarily long sequences in, but over all it is a nice little reminder for us all.And it doesn't even have sappy Hollywood ending.",7,0,1,11 May 2005
The Thing," Horror with capital H
","On the basis of given scares, The Thing pretty much is the only film that has managed to scare me on my adult age. Sure, there are some films that are just creepy, but this has managed to scare the life out of me.The story goes: A group of scientist find a spaceship buried deep in the ices of Antarctic and decide to drag a frozen alien back to their base. This thing isn't dead and soon it begins to take the appearances of the scientist and their dogs. Soon everyone suspects everyone. Who is human and who is alien.When you look at the effects it's surprising how well the grotesque puppets have taken the stand of time: they look slimy and quite living. Music gives a creepy atmosphere to film and acting is pretty good, Kurt Russel manages to do one of his best performances in this film. The Thing certainly is from the better of John Carpenter, who has a knack of doing either great films or turkeys.",9,0,2,20 November 2005
Armageddon," Harmless entertainment
","Armageddon is one of those movies, which require a theater to back them up: if you would take away all the special effects, great sound track and sound effects you would have a pile of mediocre written drama. And couple of funny jokes.I saw Armageddon in theater when it first came out and I was pretty pleased with it, I got what I wanted: a piece of popcorn flick, which didn't require brain activity in any level and I was entertained.But, I've also seen this movie from TV couple of times and I must say, small box isn't doing any favors for this flick, it's just not the same, effects wont make your chair tremble nor do those special effects look grand. Actually this is one of those movies which will age very badly and it does all ready look old in certain places. But hey, maybe someone will remake this after 30 or so years. We'll have 3D holographic effects by then I wager.So, anyway, if you are gonna watch this movie don't do it because you need a brain puzzler ala '2001: Space Odyssey', but do it, if you have decent home theater and you need to turn your brain off for a while. That's what this movie does best.",5,1,2,13 April 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good sequel of the Terminator franchise
","My next comment will get all James Cameron fans angry, but then again that is entirely their problem. I liked T3 better than T2.Sure, there are plot holes in T3 where you could drive a truck through, in fact I think they do in couple of occasions, but the bottom line is, that I was entertained more by this film than I was by T2. The main reason is, that I've never been found of Edward Furlong in the role of John Connor. I thought he was a bit annoying character in T2. In T3 John (Nick Stahl) is still a bit whiny, but he wasn't as annoying.Linda Hamilton didn't return, which was a bit shame, but luckily the movie works without her. Claire Danes substitutes as a female hero, Kate Brewster, who resembles Hamiltons original role from T1 as a woman who doesn't first believe, but soon gets the situation.Arnold is back of course, as a protector as in the T2, but now he has more attitude and his role is actually a lot better than it was in T2, at least I liked him more as a 'don't mess with me' kind of a robot.Kristianna Loken is more modified liquid circuit Lisa, who this time is able to generate weapons out of her limbs, as in energy guns, flame thrower and such.T3 is nonstop action from the beginning to the end. The pseudo philosophical aspects of two previous Cameron films have been dropped almost completely and the action scenes have grown bigger and more showing. There are couple of hilarious action scenes as well and Arnold's Terminator is a bit more comical, but not too much.As said, the movie has a couple of scenes which could have used more plot, but overall pros win over the cons. The movie is entertaining if nothing else.",8,1,2,27 January 2006
"I, Robot"," Not brilliant but above average.
","'I, robot' doesn't resemble any of Asimov stories as far I can tell. Sure, it has been a long time since I read the actual book, but I have the hunch only thing common with the movie and the book is the name Del Spooner (Will Smith) and the laws of robotics. Other than that there's no real reason to start comparing the movie on Asimov's writings. There actually is a phrase in the ending of the film 'As suggested by the stories of Asimov'. I think that rests the case in that department.So Spooner is this paranoid cop, who hates robots. He's bit racist that way, and that's not even a subtle hint. It's just stuffed on your face from the beginning. In fact there's very little anything subtle in the film, it's action from the beginning with tad too much slo-mo scenes in it. Robots of course have never done anything wrong, but it's first time for everything. Spooner starts to suspect, that a robot has killed a man in the robot factory. But no-one believes him, as there are clearly written laws (in robots programming of course) denying robots to harm humans. So let the games begin.Biggest problem actually comes from the CGI, which is okay, but in several places is just looks too fake to actually fit in the image of photo-real. This is terribly visible in the last scene of the film, which looks a tad unfinished. Maybe they were rushed, who knows. Also the scenes with massive amounts of robots and humans look fake. There are, how ever, couple of rather nice camera movements thanks to the CGI.Acting is action movie standards. Onliners split the air during action and it's mostly entertaining, thought some scenes lack the edge and the energy.I feel, that with little more effort 'I, robot' could have been much better film than it's now. Now it hangs somewhere above average.",7,0,0,5 October 2005
American Beauty," What's eating up Lester.
","If someone would ask me to name a handful of the most important movies of the 90's, or of the cinema for the matter, 'American Beauty' would be on that list. The movie basically is a transformation story of a man called Lester (Kevin Spacey), who wakes up in a revelation that he's been asleep during his life after seeing his daughters, Thora Birch, friend Angela (Mena Suvari) dancing during a recess of a basketball match. As it seems evident, that his daughter Jane and wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) both seem to think, that he's obsolete and useless, he begins to day dream of his Lolita crush and shape his future towards getting what he so desperately believes he is in need of. So he starts to puff some weed, that he buys from his new hero Ricky (Wes Bentley), and lift some weights to become the attraction he thinks Angela would be drawn to.The movie is well written and directed. There is so much poetry in some of the scenes, that you could spend hours just to watch the things to flow by, while the soundtrack is bringing the most perfect moods for each scene laid before the viewers eyes.I've seen the film may times and yet it still feels fresh each time I watch it. You can always pick up new meanings from the work of the actors and the things that are told. You can watch it and be seduced in this happy and sad tale of a man, who is just trying to figure out what he really needs.",9,0,1,27 May 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Good sequel
","John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) lives with his foster parents, while Sarah spends time in a mental hospital. John spends his time doing petty crimes with his friends, but then something happens: a liquid shape shifting android (Robert Patrcik) from the future starts to hunt him and another, older model (Arnold Schwarzengger) tries to protect him. It is now apparent to John, that his mother has always been right and so, he must bust his mom out and try to kill the liquid man, before it kills him.Plot it self doesn't actually have any other surprises besides Arnold, who now plays a good guy opposite of his portrayal of evil Terminator in the first film. Rest of the movie flows in safe routes to the predictable, yet still greatly directed and thrilling ending.Special edition, which is 20 or so minutes longer than the original gives some funny additional scenes, which won't move the story itself in a way or an another, but luckily they don't effect in the overall flow of the storyAs for sequels go Terminator 2 is from the better end, still not as good as the first one, even tough it did bring lots and lots of cash.Visually movie doesn't show any weaknesses, even tough it's made in 1991, when digital CGI effects where in their early ages. It shows, that T2 had biggest budget of it's era.Not the most original Sci-fi flick out there, but still pretty good one, with lots of solid acting from everyone involved, mixed up with neat specials and action scenes.",7,0,1,24 April 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Pingothica
","Edward (Johnny Depp) is a young man, living in a castle of his father (Vincent Price in his last role). You could say, that Edward is very unique individual: he has scissors as hands, you see his father was a scientist who was making a man, but he never finished as he died.Now this friendly Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to take Edward home, to live with her family. And so Edward fells in love with beautiful Kim (Winona Ryder). You can see Edward as a modernized version of Pinochhio, even thought he doesn't have a cricket as a guide. He tries to see what is right and wrong , is amazed from the smallest of things, amazes people on his skills as a gardener and a hair dresser. He tries to fit in the world where everyone else is far too different, but at least everyone tries, or at least politely says: 'I know a doctor who might be able to help you.' But how much difference is too much? Where is the boiling point? Do people really like Edward or are they just waiting for him to make a mistake, so they can throw him out?As a story Edward Scissorhands is very emotional, it's sad and it's happy. Tim Burton mixes greatly this suburban from 50's or 60's with magical and mystical world of Edward's. To coin a phrase: Little girl:How do you know he's still alive grandmother? Grandmother: Well, before he arrived it never snowed.This is perfect specimen of a Tim Burton film, with a heart warming and emotional story, lazed with great visual contrast between suburbs and Gothic castle, which looms over the town, of the scientist. It's the style which makes this movie to stand out from the vast sea of movies telling stories about how difficult it's to be different.",8,0,0,19 August 2005
Van Helsing," Intentionally campy and ridiculous
","If someone would ask me to define a comic book movie, I'd show them Van Helsing, as that really is how the film plays out: a comic book from from pre-WW2 era.Van Helsing is a silly, emphasis on the word silly here, yarn about vampire hunter named, well, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who surprisingly enough has lost his memory. He's aided by the Vatican and its secret stash of monks, who do nothing else than make weapons for killing the forces of dark. Van Helsing is assigned to go after Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and a young monk Carl (David Wenham) is ordered to go with him as a tech support. In Transylvania he gets help from Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), of whom family the Dracula has wowed to kill off, and surprisingly enough the creature (Shuler Hensley) that Frankenstein made.This all leads to sights and action that makes no sense in any level with the exception of entertainment value. And that really is how the film should be seen: nonsensical piece of pulp entertainment. If you start to expect some real values form it, like sense or plot or good dialog, you are certainly watching a wrong film. But it you don't mind a highly illogical film, that causes you to chuckle for its own silliness, well, you just might enjoy this ride.This film, I thought, did far better in its genre than some other films, like Sky Captain. Van Helsing is certainly worth a one look.",6,1,1,20 December 2008
Being John Malkovich," I want to be somebody
","Ever wanted to be someone else than you? I believe, that almost everyone would answer yes. What it would be like to be someone famous? You could say, that Being John Malkovich is something, that could be described as intelligent comedy. It's a story about a puppeteer Graig (John Cusack) who, because as he says no-one understands his art, seeks a job as a filing assistant in a bizarre company located between floors 7 and 8, so floor 7 and a half it is.There he gets smitten on his female co-worker Maxine (Cathrine Keener), and while trying to pursue relationship with her, his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) too fells for this femme fetal.Same time Grag finds a secret tunnel, which leads into the mind of John Malkovich (John Malkovich), who fells for Maxine, who wants to have relationship with Lotte, but only if she is inside John Malkovich.There's lot more, I just happened to find that particular triangle quite entertaining.But anyway, you could say, that this is an intelligent comedy, which tells about existence of human soul. There is drama too besides comedy and you can watch this movie and laugh or you can watch this as a drama. It works both ways.",8,0,1,4 March 2005
Spider-Man," Much better than I expected
","Spider man has always been my second least favourite (Mickey Mouse holds the first place) comic hero, that's why it was surprising, that I actually liked the Spider-Man movie.Much thanks goes to Sam Raimi, who has shown to us with his previous, and this, movies that he knows how to direct cartoony, yet still greatly flowing live action movies, like Darkman was.And then we have Willem Dafoe, who as Green Goblin steals the whole movie, which wasn't unexpected: villains are always more compiling than the good guys.Tobey Maguire isn't bad as Spider-Man and he tries he's best to make the character as complex as possible and he does deliver couple of funny jokes as Spidey.Kirsten Dunst however is left far too much in the background, so her portrayal as Mary Jane (love interest of Peter and Harry) is anything but complex.So in all pretty good superhero flick, which provided a nice surprise to a non Spider-Man fan.",7,0,0,24 April 2005
Collateral," Cruise shows what he's made of.
","I must confess, that I am not a big fan of Michael Mann. He knows how to do films, there is no question about that, but sometimes he looses his control and his movies become pointedly annoying in some sense, like 'Heat', which was like a masturbatory tease of building a situation, where Pacino and Deniro were on a screen together.And yet 'Collateral' is very similar to Mann's other movies, but it still is different, as the pacing is far more faster, as the story happens during one night. But Mann still takes his time to reflect upon his characters from metaphorical scenes and images. The trademark music video scenes are intact and the action masterfully directed. The actors are good and the atmosphere is gripping. 'Collateral' is, even though the story line lefts some room for improvement, perhaps the best of Mann.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a taxi driver who picks up a fare, who introduces himself as Vincent (Tom Cruise) and makes him a offer of 700 bucks, if Max just drives him around the city for this evening. The thing is, that Vincent is a hit-man on a job.Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx do a astonishing job, and Cruise hasn't been this good since 'Magnolia': he's a perfect bad guy, a role he should play more often, as his calm, maniac approach on Vincet is extremely intriguing. Foxx is perfect counterpart for Cruise, and it is evident that he actually is the better actor of the two, but Cruise is the one who dominates the movie.The only thing not up to par in this tale is the plot line, which lets the infamous lady faith to do far too much convenient circumstances. It also leaves unexplained why so weathered hit-man as Vincent suddenly seems to forget to guard his back. But this is just nitpicking on a movie that is in its own right a good one. It is rare to see action oriented movie, that really works in other aspects besides the action scenes themselves.",8,2,3,1 June 2006
Aliens," Intense action
","Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) has been floating in space for decades. By a stroke of luck a salvage vessel locates her and she's revived into a changed world. The destruction of Nostromo haunts her career as she's demoted as a lowly dock worker, but then she hears, that the planet her crew previous team located the deadly beast has been colonized for terraforming. Soon after this she learns, that the communications are off, so she must go to a rescue mission with some gun-ho marines.After some pretty boring character introduction scenes the action gears hit in and the latter half of the story is edge seating action with very little resemblance on the gripping horror of the first story.The special effects are great and the aliens have been multiplying in the numbers, though it seems, that this time they aren't half as mean and lean killing machines than the sole monster was in the original film. Out of the new aliens the queen is very nicely designed and executed little monster, though the portrayal of aliens as an ant community kind of group feels a bit cheap shot.All in all, Aliens delivers in action what it lacks from the story and characters. Ripley is tougher and more clearly a hero than she was in the first film and the rest of the crew is more in the part of clichéd statistics to be killed off in some part of a film. James Cameron again shows, that he knows how to direct.",7,1,3,6 August 2007
The Exorcist," Movie killed by its reputation
","In many surveys 'The Exorcist' is voted as the scariest movie ever. To be stated as good gives pressure to any film. To be stated the best gives a movie a weight which is almost unbearable. In my opinion 'The Exorcist' is not the scariest film ever made, it's not even close. Sure, it has some goods scenes, but they all come after hours of boredom after uneventful story.Also Friedkin's direction fails to bring out much needed tension and feeling of uneasiness to this film.Another reason why I didn't find this movie scary is, that I am not a catholic nor a religious person by nature. The whole possessed by the devil is too straight forwarded as an idea for me to bring thrills through my spine.As for actors the mantle goes to Max Von Sydow, as he is clearly the best actor of the film. Other actors and directing is average at best.I can recommend 'The Exorcist' only as a curiosity not as a frightening horror film.",5,2,7,19 May 2005
Spirited Away," Wonderful animation.
","Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, or Spirited Away as the name is translated, is probably the best animated movie I've seen for a while.Summary of the story: Young girl Chihiro is is moving with her parents, when they stop for a while at place, which her father describes as old amusement park. But soon it is visible, that this place is no ordinary amusement park. When sun sets Chihro's parents turn into pigs and spirits, ghosts and ancient gods start to roam around in a place ruled by old witch Yubaba. Chihiro must rescue her parents and herself from eternal slavery in Yubaba's bath house.Not your typical Disney cartoon. And that is a compliment. No ready chewed, easy to point up moral codes, but more real grip from things. A line between good and bad is very vague line. Is Yuababa really a evil witch or is she just greedy old woman, who can learn from her mistakes? Do all bad deeds bring more sorrow, or can they sometimes bring something good? Chihiro grows, really grows during the story. She begins from a wimpy little girl and ends up to be brave, selfless girl, who ends up saving more --hmmm-- I think entities would be proper word in this case.But Chihiro is not the only one growing during the story, there is also a nameless spirit named no-face, who ends up finding peace thanks to Chihiro.There is also a young boy, Yubaba's apprentice Haku, who doesn't know who he really is. Yubaba is using Haku as a tool against her twin sister Zeniba.It is rare, that a single movie contains so much material. It is even more rare to see animated movies with such depth.Also for the acting, it's top notch, as is the animation. All backgrounds and characters are done with detail and passion.I really feel, that this is one of those must see movies for all animation fans.",10,14,26,2 February 2005
Tropic Thunder," Well made war spoof
","Movie spoofs are a difficult genre, as if they are made to spoof very recent movies they usually work only a couple of years, if the movies spoofed in them fade away fast. So in a sense it's much more safer to do a spoof of a genre by using classic elements from genre movies that people have remembered for years and will most likely remember in the future as well.Tropic Thunder is a comedy, that takes its humor from Hollywood stereotypes and Vietnam war movies in general and that is a smart move as I would reckon jokes about half crazy method actors, sexually insecure rap artists, money grubbing producers and drugs popping funny men are always valid. Most direct movie jokes are ripped from movies that are in the general knowledge of most movie viewers, like Platoon and Saving Privare Ryan and the other jokes are in general made from material that doesn't require vast movie knowledge.Ben Stiller has managed to direct a well cast, well written movie, in which we see some actors in very untypical roles, like Tom Cruise as an obnoxious movie mogul, while some just seem to parody them shelves, just as it seems to be with Robert Downey, who plays a part of a method actor taking his commitment to a role a bit too far.If you like good movie based comedies with some bit more edged humour, you might like Tropic Thunder as well. It's not as profane as Peter Jackson Meet the Feebles for an example, but it has its moments.",8,0,2,13 February 2010
Resident Evil," survival comedy
","As to view Resident Evil as an movie would be overstatement, because in the end the movie is just a filmed game session. Not brilliant, but not so terrible crap either.I laughed in several places where I probably should have been terrified or scared, so i actually can't recommend this one if you are looking for real horror, but if you can tolerate cheesy plot and bad acting and want some laughs, this is for you then. There is just a bit too much unintentional comedy in the film, the whole seriousness of the tone just adds in that factor.Not one of the best movies of Milla Jovovich",4,0,1,6 February 2004
Quantum of Solace," The wheel keeps turning
","A car chase! A shoot out! A running chase! A boat chase! A chase with airplanes! And all kinds of fighting in between.Quantum of Solace is edge seating action from the opening scene to, well almost, the end. The story boots up from where Casino Royale left and Bonds is soon in the tail of an unknown, yet extremely powerful organization, that has tied its tentacles around both political and business world. Main villain of the tale is Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), who is seemingly a well meaning environmentalist, but in the shadows he has far more sinister ideas. Though he's not the head man of the organization, that is something we will see in the third Craig Bond, as QoS is clearly a middle part of a far more bigger tale that was spawned in 'Casino Royale'.Despite Bond is always on the move, rescuing damsels, and pretty much killing before asking the questions, a thing that is noted even in the story by the M, and getting to his goal with a pinch of pure luck, he is evolving during the movie. A bit by bit, despite how small, he is gaining those traits people know him of. The soundtrack echoes familiar notes, while the rugged and arrogant Bond is slowly turning into more suave agent. It isn't hard to depict, that in the third Craig vessel Bond will be almost like people know him, but still not quite. Change is the major theme of the story.QoS wasn't as good as Casino Royale was. But it isn't a bad movie either, it just seems to suffer from the middle part of the story syndrome, in which it thinks, that things, that happened in the previous Bond film, Casino Royale, are familiar to the viewers, as if you aren't, you don't get all the stuff that goes on. And the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could be, as it clearly indicates a place, where the last part will begin. But thankfully enough, the movie is entertaining. And that is the main reason to watch a Bond film.",7,2,3,8 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Entertaining action film.
","After hearing lots of negative feedback about 'Alien VS. Predator' I had my expectations pretty low. For my delight I was entertained by this clash of the modern monster titans.After the uneventful beginning and cardboard characterization, we are taken to Antartctic ocean, in where Wyland, Wyland is played by Lance Henriksen, which is a nice nod towards the Alien series, corporations has located an ancient pyramid, buried deep within ice. The pyramid, of course, contains one deadly alien Queen and, to grant the other beast in the title, the predators are on their holiday hunt trip.After most humans and predators have been wiped out by the aliens we get to see a pairing of predator and guide Alex (Sanaa Lathan), whom together wipe out the rest of the droolies.If you can forgive pretty weak basic plot, and I see no reason you couldn't as this is an action film, the action is very entertaining. The aliens kill predators and humans and the predators kill aliens and humans and the humans just mainly die, like the humans they are.I could write a lengthy article about the inconstancy's in the film. Most of them happen during the monster brawls, and mainly deal with the alien blood and the predator weapons, but I won't.Paul W. S. Anderson has managed to make pretty decent action film. It isn't, say as good as the first Predator or the first Alien, but it is entertaining.",7,1,2,15 November 2006
No Country for Old Men," Another good film from the Coens
","From my opinion 'No Country for Old Men' isn't the best Coen brothers film. But that is not to say, it's a bad film, far from it, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did of 'Fargo' or 'Big Lebowski'.The story starts, when a lone man Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunting in the desert. He happens to stumble upon a busted drug deal and he finds a satchel full of money which he decides to keep to himself. Little he knows, that a psychotic killer Anton Cigurh (Javier Bardem) is also after the money, while sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to figure out crime, he no longer understands.No Country could have turned out to be yet another a typical action film, in which everything travels steady as a train towards anti-climatic ending, which can be guessed straight from the opening scene. This would be the case, if the movie would have been done anyone else, than the Coen's. They manage to do a story, that manages to be quite surprising, despite oh so familiar elements.All in all, No Country is a good, solid film. Personally, as I stated in the beginning, I didn't like it as much I did like of some of the earlier Coen movies, but I still can recommend it, if you like their movies, as it really is a solid piece of cinema.",8,2,3,22 June 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A clear step up from the first Hobbit.
","Let's get the best news out of the way: As a movie Desolation of Smaug is much better movie than the Unexpected Jourrney was. It moves well, pacing is great, acting is mostly great, special effects, especially Smaug, look mostly stunning and the music and the set are great as ever.And here's the but: it takes a lot of liberties with the story. A lot of the scenes in the movie have only bare bones resemblance with the book. This, however, isn't a surprise, as the first movie altered the narrative from the book quite a bit. So you either roll with it and are okay with the changes, or you cringe your teeth. I rolled with em', as the movie itself is good.Just like the first movie, I saw this one in HFR as well. I must say, that during the first film of the series I had some issues with the quality, but now it looks like most of the small issues have been cleaned aside.Like the Two Towers, Desolation of Smaug has no real ending. Afer all is said and done, the movie comes into sudden stop, where, I assume, the third, and the last, movie will continue straight on.DoS is very entertaining, well crafted movie. It is a step up from the first movie and allows to expect good things from the last movie.",8,8,13,15 December 2013
Batman Begins," Surpassesd expectations
","It seems, that after a couple of misses the Batman has finally returned as he was meant to be, as 'Batman Begins' fully surpassed my expectations after those dreadful Bat movies by Joel Schumacher.The movies to compare BB would be the two previous films by Tim Burton, 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns', yet the style is very different, as Burton's Batman was more Gothic and much more comic book like in style, though those films did have the serious undertone in them. Nolan's Batman tries to be much closer to real world, though after the movie really starts to kick in, it is evident, that real world exist for the name only. The Bat scare bits, by this I mean the tricks he does to scare the thugs and such, are very well done, and I was surprised how effective they were, as the trailer gave really bad impression out of this movie.This time we see a much more focused story of how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) becomes the Batman. We see him training in the reclusive monastery deep on the mountains of Tibet. Then we see him gathering his gear, by the help of Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred (Michael Caine). We see him making acquittance with Comissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman). And we see, of course, Batman rattling up the criminal underworld in a form of gangsters and of course one of my favourite Bat villains the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). This all is very well done, scripted and acted. As I said I didn't actually wait for much, as I had seen those pesky trailers made from the film and those really did gave me a wrong impression out of the film. 'Batman Begins' really is the third good Batman film, and it can be seen, in some ways at least, as a prequel to Burton's movies. 'Batman Forever' and 'Batman and Robin' can finally be forgotten.",9,1,2,30 May 2006
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Fantastic return to Middle Earth
","Well, let's get the worst out of the way first. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is clearly the most unbalanced entry of the Jackson's Tolkien movies. The first hour is clearly a bit too long and could do some tweaking. And that's the biggest complaint I have with the movie. Other than that, it offers a fantastic return to Middle Earth.After the pacing issues are resolved, the movie hits in the high gear and finds its balance, balancing between serious and whimsical, just like it should.the spacial effects are again top notch and Gollum is even more spectacular creation than ever. HFR is often discussed when it comes to the Hobbit and just like many others, I noted that it works amazingly well on some scene and in some scenes it looks a bit odd, especially if there's a quick cut involved. But when it works, it works marvelously well. I often found myself dumb struck on how real everything looked. When the stone giants battled each other, I could have sworn that I was looking outside the window.So, to sum it up, Jackson & co. have managed to return to the Middle Earth with honor. Not the best movie on the series, but not a horrible movie either. And I won't be expecting a EE version out of this one, as it really, really, really doesn't need one.",7,3,10,19 December 2012
The Princess Bride," Great and charming fantasy adventure
","In a far away kingdom there lived a fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and a young farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes), who were in love. But as Westley was a poor man, he decided to go to the seas in order to find his luck, but the unspeakable happened and he died, when a pirates attacked his ship. Years later the fair maiden Buttercup is to be marry the prince, the king to be, Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). And from this the true adventure begins.The story actually begins with a sick boy, who's visited by his grandfather, who wants to read him a book, which has ran in the family for ages. This little narration, made by Peter Falk as the grand father and Fred Savage as the grandson, gives nice, warm little story of its own to the overall adventuring.Other notable characters in the film are Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who's searching high and low for the man with 11 fingers, who murdered his father, and a friendly giant Fezzik (André the Giant), who is eager give out a helping hand.'The Princess Bride' is well written and fun adventure movie, that flows forwards with ease not many films are capable of. All in all, it belongs amongst the best fantasy adventures made in the 80's.",9,1,6,10 January 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Entertaining if a tad too long spy action
","If anything Mission:Impossible has been a fickle series of quality among its movies. Some people had give up the hope before M:I3 and were, like me, positively surprised when it turned out to be a good movie.This time Brad Bird of Pixar fame was on the helm the movie and I do have to say, that the result is quite entertaining. The plot itself is pretty typical 'stop the terrorist nuclear attack'-deal and the action scenes are as ludicrous you'd expect, but the style of the movie doesn't venture too far in the direction of M:I2, which is thought was idiotic beyond silly. Also the final act of the movie lost a quite lot of steam as it did felt like a try to make the movie a bit longer.Tom Cruise is in a good shape and does his part as Ethan Hunt with such a vigor it's just enjoyable to watch. Personally I've never though him as a good 'good guy' actor, his better roles have always been the bad guys, but this time he actually made me feel, that he is in fact a hero.The rest of the cast does quite well with the material they are given. The bad guys are a bit bland and not that interesting, but overall the movie is entertaining for what it is.",7,2,4,22 February 2012
Ghost Rider," Rather boring escapade
","It's surprising how a movie filled with hell spawns and a flaming, skeletal avenger can be a dull experience, but there you have it. Ghost Rider proves, that even from the interesting material it is possible to make a lifeless pancake.Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) is a stunt driver, who in his youth made a deal with Mephistoteles (Peter Fonda), who in exchange of Johnnys soul cures his father of cancer.Later, after Johnny is older, Mephistoteles comes to collect by turning him into Ghostrider, a bounty hunter of hell, who brings back the escaped dark souls.Despite there's a lot going on in the movie, like a romance and Blackheart (Wes Bentely) trying to get his hands on a contract that would grant him great powers, not a thing feels like there's anything at stake. Everything is done paint by the numbers and the end result is more boring than exiting. The poor script and mediocre directing don't help at all, when Cage is hamming it up as he goes.Shame really, as Ghost Rider is one of those characters with potential. He would just need to be portrayed in a bit more darker shades than this.",4,0,0,10 March 2012
Hellboy," Comic book movie from the better end
","Before we start, this one is written by someone who has only seen the Director's cut, not the theatrical version.As for comic book adaptations go Hellboy definitely is from the better end of the city: it's interesting, action is good and characters are really, really out of this world. How does this sound: Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a red skinned daemon, Abe Sapien (David Hyde Pierce (voice)) is some sort of fish-man mutant and the main villains are ageless, possessed Nazi's lead by Rasputin (Karel Roden). Yes, that legendary Rasputin from the court of Russian Tzars.Original comic Hellboy has more of a cult following than anything else and as someone who isn't a huge fan of the original comic I felt that the movie was far better constructed. The comic was too loose with its stories, there was rarely anything that connected the adventures of Hellboy. Some stories were extremely good, but there are those which are just stuffing for empty space. It must be admitted here, that the plot of the movie isn't very complicated or even very original, but it works and it's full of nice dialog and good action scenes. Even the romance of Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) is relatively nicely done.All in all, this is worthy of a glance even for those, who are looking for good action movie. I would suppose, that if you take history very seriously and can't enjoy creative usage of world history then this movie might get you angry, but for everyone else, watch it.",9,0,0,12 July 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The middle
","The Two Towers continues almost straight from where Fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are going towards Mordor, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).I was amazed by the special effects of the Fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in The Two Towers. I was gravely mistaken. In the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in The Fellowship, Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast.Small skirmishes of the Fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in The Two Towers, when orc army of Saruman attacks towards Rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king Theoden (Bernard Hill), who is mislead by his councillor Wormtongue (chilling Brad Dourif), while his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth.Theatrical version of The Two Towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. All this was fixed beautifully in the Extended Edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. I personally enjoyed all of the extended and added Ent sequences. Also EE introduces us one new character, Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir (David Fenham) and Boromir (Sean Bean).The battle of Helms Deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. Fall of Isengard, home of Saruman, is shown as Tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat.Peter Jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the Warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like Elves coming to help defend Helms Deep. Some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either.Overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. It all just shows, that The Two towers is just a middle part of a longer story.",10,1,1,22 May 2005
The Incredibles," Smart, fun, clever, exiting and atmospheric
","I've heard a lot of positive things about the Incredibles and surprisingly enough, the movie really is worth of the praises it got.After a man, who didn't want to be saved gets saved by an superhero Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), a string of costly lawsuits is filled against the damage caused by the masked vigilantes. This leads into banning of superheroes, who are forced to retreat into normal living, hiding their powers from the people.After 15 years of silence and a family, that is formed of Elastigirl / Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) and two sons, baby Jack Jack and Dash (Spencer Fox), Mr. Incredible /Bob Parr gets an offer an old hero can't refuse. This gets him involved in an evil scheme of Syndrome (Jason Lee), who want's to even the field between regulars and supers. On a bit smaller role is Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), an old ally and a friend of Mr. Incredible.The Incredibles is funny right from the start and very well written. The story flows with an ease and the action scenes are exiting and well made. The animation is top notch and this all is nicely finished with a swinging soundtrack.In all I have nothing bad to say about the film, it certainly is amongst the best CGI animations made.",9,0,0,3 April 2009
Stardust," What are we willing to do for love?
","When a movie delivers you an emotional impact, other than pure loathing towards it, you know you're dealing with a well made story, that manages to play the right strings somewhere inside you. This was something that happened to me during 'Stardust' when I noted tears bursting from my eyes while watching the love to be woven between a star and a man in midst of a fairytale written for adults.It all begins, when a young boy crosses a barrier between fantasy and reality and arrives to a fair held in a field near the city he lives in. There he meets a girl, whom he fells instantly. 9 months from that, Dunstan (Ben Barnes, later on Nathaniel Parker as he gets older) gets a basket delivered to him. Inside this basket is a baby boy, Tristan (Charlie Cox), who's a result from his affair with the girl.Later in life Tristan fells in love with a bit arrogant and selfish girl Victoria (Sienna Miller), to whom he promises to bring a falling star from behind the barrier wall. From this begins Tristans adventure for true love, as he's about to find out that the star is not what he thought.'Stardust' is filled with wonderful characters and actors. Michelle Pfeiffer does a wonderful role as a wicked witch who's after Yvaine's (Claire Danes) heart and Robert De Niro does humorous and quirky part as captain Shakespeare, a rowdy captain of lighting catchers.Laced with beautiful soundtrack and rather stunning visuals 'Stardust' is very well rounded up tale. The story written as a novel by Neil Gaiman works almost as well on a screen than it does on its original form. Definitely recommendable viewing.",9,4,6,16 September 2008
Driven," Harlins worst film
","Driven is the weakest movie directed by Renny Harlin. There are some things that work in the film, but those few scenes are strongly over powered by the weak aspects of the production.First the things I liked: car crashes. Yes, Harllin is very good at doing and directing action scenes and it shows on those crashes, even tough they are as unreal as they can be. I give my points to the crashes. that's about all I liked.So my dislikes: poor script. Seen it millions of times: retired 'master' (in this case Stallone) has to show the ropes to the new promise (Kip Pardue). Nothing new under the sun, literally nothing. Stallone has written Rocky all over, he just has changed boxing to car sports.Special effects: As I said, I liked the crashes, but some of the CGI used in this film is beyond amateurish. The slow motion rain drops is good idea, but it's killed with a poor execution.Music wasn't anything spectacular, actually I don't even remember a note of it, so I guess it wasn't distracting.If you want to see a good Harlin/Stallone film I recommend Cliffhanger, it did everything better.",3,0,1,20 December 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacular, spectacular
","Mouling Rogue! is, at this moment, best movie that Baz Luhrmann has made. Romeo+Juliet was visually very similar, but it did lack the continuity of Moulin Rgue!. Whole fairy tale like feeling of the story makes this movie more enjoyable to watch.I am not huge fan of musicals, but I must confess that I adore Moulin Rogue. It has much to do with familiar songs that have been rearranged to fit in the musical pieces of the story. Many who have seen this movie pick out the wonderful tango version of The Police son Roxanne, but my personal favorites are wonderful adaptation of Madonna's Like A virgin and Queen's Show Must go On. But there are many others as well, whole movie is a fireworks of visual and musical candy.Whole movie is filled with fantastic actors. Ewan Mcgregor does mans work as Christian, a romantic, who fells in love radiant Moulin Rogue courtesan Satine, played Nicole Kidman, who has never looked more stunning. Richard Roxburgh as the Duke is wonderfully sleazy and disgusting villain, bringing great contrast against naive Christian.I could go on and on. It is hard to find bad performance from this movie.Enough is enough. You either love it or hate it. Go see it and decide. I love it.",9,2,2,28 February 2005
Back to the Future Part III," Good ender to the series
","Surprisingly the third instalment of the 'Back To The Future' series still holds up the interested to the end, and even tough it's not as funny as the first one it does have a couple of delicious scenes in it.This time Marty (Fox) goes in to the wild west to save his friend Doc (Lloyd) from early dead of lead poisoning. We also see Doc falling in love with pretty teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen).Special effects are again used more sparingly, just like in the first one, which is a good thing considering the state of special effects of that time. This ensures, that the viewers won't have enough time to start criticizing them and they look good enough to fool the eye. The bloat of effects was a small problem in part 2 of the series.There are small amount of jokes and situations, that are direct continuity from the two previous films and you need to have a keen eye to spot all the reference jokes to the previous episodes. The truth be said, I don't believe, that the film wouldn't work as well if you haven't watched the previous films before, just because of the whole time continuum play.This is a good ender for the series and I hope, that this will be it. But if the third sequel will ever be made I would hope, that it would be made by the same individuals involved in the series, as I doubt it would be the same without Fox and Lloyd.",7,0,0,17 February 2006
Transformers," Big, loud and stupid
","I tried to think something sensible to say about Transformers, but came into conclusion, that I really don't have anything else to say, but to say congratulations for the special effects team that worked with the movie.Michael Bay isn't a subtle director who makes important, world changing movies. He is a man, who helms big, loud, stupid, overly sentimental and far too serious movies and he does it with pride and he does it well. Transformers is the statement for his skill of taking an idea that could turn into a great piece of garbage and churn it into a pretty entertaining movie about extraterrestrial robots, teenagers and the possible annihilation of the human race. He hammers the movie together with a sledge hammer and despite he sometimes fails, like he did with the Island, Bay manages to deliver with the Transformers.So yeah, that's all I have to say about this.",6,1,4,7 March 2010
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Bo-h-ring action/horror
","No plot, no character development, cheesy scares and silly action. That's in the nutshell everything, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has to offer. The first film was okay, if you could appreciate the comedic aspect of the film, but RE:A hits the action throttle so far back, that every scene in it turns either unintentionally funny or just plain boring.If you are looking for a horror film turn away, as RE:A doesn't have slightest bit in common with the genre. It is more of a brainless action in style of Commando, though you could argue that at least Commando HAD some kind of a plot thingy in it.This time the film has two babes killing off the deaders, though that doesn't matter the slightest in terms of personality or characterization. They both are more thought than anyone else and all the other characters are in the movie just to be killed off. Milla Jovovich makes a return as Alice and the other chick is Jill, played by Sienna Guillory.Special effects are okay, but far from the greatest ever. In more than one occasion the CGI is far too noticeable. Music isn't anything worth mentioning and neither is the acting, or any of the actors for the matter, as it all is just so... ordinary.Score: 3/10 Camp score: 3/10",3,0,1,13 November 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun, stylish sci-fi adventure
","Guardians of the Galaxy is without any doubt the best Marvel movie I've seen. One big reason for that is, that it doesn't feel like you'd need to be familiar with every other Marvel movie out there: GotX stands on its own feet. None of the other Marvel movies feel this much like stand alone movies.When you think of it, GotX is a movie that is easy to watch even for a non-Marvel fan as a story about a boy who got abducted and became a space outlaw. Then he makes friends with a ragtag group of people and they end up saving the universe. It's fun, well made sci-fi flick, that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't care if you know Iron-Man, Hulk or Captain America. Those are names that mean nothing in the part of the galaxy this movie takes place.What makes GotX also stand out is its relaxed atmosphere. Unlike many other sci-fi movies out there, it doesn't try to be unproportionally epic, it tries, and succeeds, to be a fun adventure, with characters you can root for. Sure, there's not that much character development with the bad guys, but you know they're bad and sometimes that's enough information.Guardians of the Galaxy is one Marvel movie I'd recommend even for those people who aren't into Marvel movies. Out of their line up it definitely is easiest to watch.",8,1,7,23 January 2016
The Evil Dead," Good small budget horror film
","'The Evil Dead' is very atmospheric, small budget horror film. The tension is build by the unseen horror, that haunts the teens enjoying their time out in a small cabin away from everything.The obvious lack of huge budget has driven Sam Raimi in a very good decision not to show the thing, that turns people into a flesh hungry monsters. Weird camera angles and eerie music give the film a throbbing personality, with very eerie atmosphere.As said, the plot goes like this: A group of friends go into a cabin middle of nowhere. Then they discover a human flesh bound book, the Necronomicon, and they of course awaken the evil in the forest. Silly for them. The evil then starts to hunt the friends one after another, turning them into a flesh craving monsters. The death is always near.There are some rather campy jokes in the beginning of the film, but it does turn into a rather serious horror film in one point. It's the build up of the atmosphere that does it. There is also the fact of not showing the main baddie, which gives the viewer a good change to let his/hers mind to make out its appearance.Bruce Campbell is the one actor, who rose from the film as a lovable b-film star he is today, as for other careers the Raimi bunch came along this film.All in all a very good horror film for the fans of the genre.",8,1,3,20 February 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Fine action flick
","Might contain spoilers.First thing, before watching this movie,please make sure, that the realism switch in your brains is turned off. Otherwise it could be tad hard to fully enjoy this visually very stunning movie.So, what goes on in 'Kill Bill'? Well, 'The Bride', played by Uma Thurman wakes up after 4 years coma and wants to have revenge on the people who caused this state to her. So slash, slash, bang bang, boom boom. That's about it. This could have been one lousy movie... happily it isn't. It is action at is finest.Main character is 'The Bride', who is having her roaring revenge against 'Bill', played by David Carradine, not shown in vol. 1., only heard as a voice. Lucy Liu does fine job as a half Japanese Yakuza boss, prettily dressed in kimono, but from all the baddies in 'Kill Bill' is one-eyed 'Elle Driver' portrayed by Daryl Hannah.So, what else? Yes, there's lot's of chopping in this movie, and I mean lots. So I can honestly say, not for the smallest members of your family. All action is very cartoony and visually impressive.I liked it worth of 8 out of 10",8,5,12,23 January 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Solid Burton film
","'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was never one of those books, that were part of my childhood, nor have I read it later in life, so I watched this adaptation with out knowledge of how things go on in the book. Also, I haven't seen the 1971 adaptation, so my view is formed only by this movie.Willy Wonka (Jhonny Depp) is a recluse chocolate manufacturer, who lives in a huge factory. One day he hides 5 golden tickets inside the candy bars he makes, so that 5 lucky children could spend a day in his magical factory with their parents. One of the winners is of course Charlie (Freddie Highmore), who is a poor, yet good and honest boy. The other kids are obese Augustus (Philip Wiegratz), competitive Violet ( AnnaSophia Robb), spoiled and rich Veruca (Julia Winter) and know it all Mike (Jordan Fry).Together the children, accompanied by their parents, are lead by Willy Wonka in the huge factory, that is filled with whimsical gadgets, astonishing discoveries and small Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy), who are servants and workers of Wonka's factory. But little do they know, that Wonka has an ulterior motive of having the kids visiting the factory.Visually the movie is just as good you can expect director like Tim Burton to deliver. The sound track by Danny Elfman is again spot on for the atmosphere and settings of the film and the actors do a very good job.In short, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is such a movie, you'd expect seasoned film maker like Burton to make. Despite I had some script issues with the story, the other parts of the film work so well, that it is easy to forgive some oddities displayed in the film.",7,0,1,3 March 2009
Big Fish," Fantastic tale of a man.
","Even though director Tim Burton is best know for his action/fantasy movies with Gothic design, he does know how to do good drama as well. 'Big Fish' is very good proof on that and it hasn't even effected his style, as the story we see in the film is filled with fantastic views and even some Gothic design.Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) comes home, when he hears that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is sick and near death. Will hasn't spoken with his father for a while, as he's fed up with the fantastic stories he always tells of his life and Will just want's to know the real man behind all the tales. But Ed doesn't change his mind, he just colors his life story with giants and werewolves and mermaids and witches. But then Will finds out, that there is a certain amount of truth behind the words.The movie divides between the present, in which we see the relationship between Will and Ed, and the past, in which we see young Ed Bloom (fantastic Ewan McGregor) in the midst of his tales. Steadily we see, how Will becomes to accept his father in the way he is, a man, who has imagined far more grander than it actually was, because he's a natural born story teller, who seeks acceptance of his fellow men by telling his amusing tales.Without the touch of Burton 'Big Fish' could have been quite ordinary little drama of father and a son. Now it is a bit grander than life, a fairytale of fantasy and reality, in which all parts click together, like finely tuned clockwork.",9,0,0,14 November 2006
The Dark Knight," New standard for comic book movies
","A daring bank heist kicks open the second Batman film directed by Christopher Nolan. Continuing on the path provided in the Batman Begins, The Dark Knight balances itself between reality and comic book fantasy. The action certainly is from the comics in the way of realism, but the style is nothing but gritty realism, but even that it seems to do in steroids, which is not a bad thing.As some other reviewers have stated, this movie is not about the Batman (Christian Bale), but the Joker (Heath Ledger), who is not given a similar birth story like he was in Tim Burton's Batman film, but who just enters the room, so to speak, and is utterly insane and fascinating in his own deadly way. In fact I was mesmerized how little Ledger resembled anything I'd seen him before this. I wasn't looking at an actor, I was looking at the Joker, ripped from the pages of the comic books and thrown on the screen in his full insanity intact.The second criminal in the tale is Twoface, aka Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who's a district attorney of Gotham city, who has a transformation of his own in the tale, all thanks to Joker's twisted little games.The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The story twists and turns in every way, but it manages to keep in tact better than some films with simpler lines. Well chosen actors mixed with good score, well woven plot, stunning cinematography and breath taking action makes The Dark Knight one of the best films to come out in ages.",10,10,21,4 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Still one of the greatest
","2001 is probably the most philosophical movie I've ever seen in my life. It's meanings and themes shift through every time you see it and you always find something new from it. It is a long movie, but it never turns tiresome. Ages ago, before man was aware of his surroundings a bunch of man apes were living their life. On one day, a huge monolith appeared and suddenly apes begun to evolve. They figured out how to use weapons. From this we shift into the future, where similar artifact is found from the moon. Soon scientist are sent to research it... and the it happens, the monolith sends a message, which is tracked towards Jupiter. So, a group of explorers are sent forward to see, what is out there.Now, this is not a very typical sci-fi movie. There are no big bangs, no blood thirsty aliens but just two men and a computer. Main characters of the movie are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), which is one of the most memorable movie villains ever. Yes, the bad guy of the movie is man made super computer. But it's not HAL's fault really. HAL is just doing what it is programmed to. Acting is very good throughout whole movie, but most memorable part is HAL 9000, which is one of my favorite performances in movie history.Special effects of the movie are truly spectacular, when viewed on when they were made (1968) and even in todays standards, which is very rare thing on older special effects. They did not win special effects Oscar (only one on Kubricks career) for nothing.20001: Space Odyssey doesn't let you go easily. You really need to think what you see. Kubrick didn't want to serve you readily chewed dish of pseudo philosophy ala Matrix, but a genuine possibility for the viewer to really reflect himself and humanity.",10,1,3,24 February 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Depressed memories
","It's rather safe to say, than Jim Carrey has finally rose from the ranks of Ace Ventura (if someone still doubted him after Man On The Moon) as a 'real' actor.Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Minds deals with the relationship of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). They both go through a treatment, that erases all their memories they have about each other. But in the verge of being treated Joel realises, that he doesn't want to lose his mementos: he wants to remember, so he struggles and tries to hide his love from the procedure.Almost whole movie is shown as the procedure, Joel rummages through his memories, sees flashes of things that have happened, tries to save them. On the outside we see the doctors, who are working on him.Whole point of the film is, that even thought we want to erase certain things from our mind would that really be something what we want to do? Would that take something out from us? Would we turn into someone else if our memories were taken? Maybe it's just good for us to remember. Everything.This move certainly isn't for everyone. It contains no action, juts fine acting and a very intriguing plot line. So, if action is something you want steer clear from this one, if you want something to think about, well this is for you then.",8,0,1,23 August 2005
Taken," A real edge seater
","Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a man, who tries to reconnect with his daughter after spending most of her youth somewhere else than home. He's a bit overprotective, as he claims he's seen the world as it is and he gets more nervous, when he learns, that his daughter is leaving in France together with another young girl. And then his worst nightmares come true, when his daughter is kidnapped. But the reason, why Bryan was so much else where than home is, that he is a former, top notch agent, who won't stop until he gets his daughter back.At a first glance, you can say, that Taken is a cliché. And it is, but there's no shame in that, when it's so damned well made one. Despite I knew what was going to happen, I still managed to be thrilled and exited. I literally was sitting on the edge of my seat for the last half an hour.Good director, well casted and solid piece of action. All in all, well spent hour and a half.",8,0,1,20 August 2009
Avatar," A solid movie, but no means a master piece
","I wont go in the debate about the plot of this movie, nor do I want to blame Cameron from possible idea thefts, as Avatar really is a story, that has been done tens of times since there has been written stories.The simplistic story is well played, but for such a long movie the characters stay mostly in the level of caricatures, which is a shame, as now good actors like Sigorney Weaver and Stephen Lang are left almost unused background material. Lang especially is such an one dimensional character, that there's no doubt left of his evil nature. There's no gray areas in between, he's just evil.What I want to say though is, that the movie looks great. Even the Na'vi, which design I'm not that keen about looked mostly very convincing. But because they used so much time in creating the fauna of Pandora I felt that from times I was watching a nature documentary instead of a sci-fi/fantasy flick.All said, Avatar is not a terrible way to spend a couple of hours. It looks good and moves along pretty well, despite it feels a bit too chopped from here and there.",7,3,8,21 December 2009
Saw," Sadistic, very unpleasant horror flick
","Two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes), wake up, chained on the wall, in a small room. In the middle of the room there is a dead body, holding a tape player. Men find tapes from their pockets and they soon find out, that they are in the middle of a sick game, organized by a sick serial killer. The name of the game is: Kill the other man and be free. They are also provided with two saws. You do the math. Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) tries to run against time to catch that sadistic SOB, called the Jigsaw, because of twisted games he plays with his victims.I really can't say Saw is for the most faint hearted people in the world: It's gruel, sadistic and bloody. It rolls along its sadistic rails, steadily to the end, even though the plot has some small details, which were left unpolished or unthought. Some aspects of the story are rather silly, if you start to think about them, but those things won't get in the way of the horror, no matter how illogical they seem afterward. I'd recommend this one for the horror genre fans, but I would think it twice if you are just a regular 'Scream' or 'I know What you Did last summer' type of horror watcher",8,0,1,27 July 2005
The Last Samurai," More than I bargained for
","I didn't know much about The Last Samurai when I grabbed it from the sales bin and popped it in my DVD player at home. I was expecting something more popcorn, but instead I got well made action drama. The whole seriousness of the film really surprised me.Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is man, who has lost hie belief in humanity. He's washed out soldier for hire who is hired by Omura (Masato Harada) to train Japanese troops in order to dispose a rebellious samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). One thing leads to another and soon Algren finds himself surrounded by samurais, apprehended in a small village in the mountains. Both, Algren and Katsumoto, learn a thing or two from each other, but it really is Katsumoto who changes the destiny of Algren.There actually isn't anything spectacularly original in the movies plot, it's just one growth story among others, but the settings, actors and direction is so fantastic, that it's rather hard not to like this movie. You can say a lot of things about Cruise as a person, but after I saw him in Eyes Wide Shut I've came into a conclusion, that he really is a great actor. I can't pinpoint any bad actor from the cast, Watanabe does great performance and Koyuki does small, but effective role as Taka, Katsumotos sister, who takes care of Algren, even tough he has killed her husband.In all things considered The Last Samurai is among the better movies of Tom Cruise.",9,1,3,22 January 2006
A Clockwork Orange," A Sociological study
","It's weird how a movie can look so modern and fresh even tough it was made in 1971. Not many movies can do the same.A Clockwork Orange tells a tale of a man, who isn't exactly a nice lad: He rapes, steals, fights and kills. No need to moralize, he's not a hero, there are no heroes or heroines in the film, the movie just tells about him and what happens to him in the society. So Alex (Malcolm McDowell) leads his gang of droogs and spends time in a Milk Bar (not drinking exactly regular milk, mind you) plotting out for things to do. But so it happens, that Alex gets caught and is imprisoned. Soon he's taken for a guinea-pig in an experiment to brainwash criminal behavior out from his mind. Every time Alex is thinking anything criminal he's punished with pain. But what happens to man, when his right to make decision, no matter how bad they would be, is taken from him? This is the question Stanley Kubrick so masterfully examines in his cinematic essay. To get in the end of this movie is actually surprisingly easy, because of the unique visuals and dialogue: Everything flows forward like a dream, but everything has a meaning and a purpose.Watch it once, twice as many times you want, you'll always find something new from it.",9,0,2,8 July 2005
From Hell," A disappointment
","To the defense of the makers of the movie 'From Hell' it must be said, that no one could have followed the material written by Alan Moore to the graphical novel drawn by Eddie Campbell: there just is too much plot for a single movie. If by the other hand they would have decided to make a TV-series out of the novel, the result would have been entirely different.The most constructive difference between the graphical novel and the movie is, that the novel is about Jack The Ripper: who he is and why he does what he does. The movie is a film about Abberline and his personality and his mission to stop the monster. And some fool decided to add these mystical foresight abilities to Abberline, who in fact was described as rather normal fellow in the novel.Jhonny Depp plays the part of Abberline, and that was a bit disappointment for all, who actually have read the novel, as Abberline is no where near Depp's appearance: he's shorter and more rounder. Best role of the film is given to Ian Holm, who play Dr. Sir William Gull, the official doctor of the royal family. The rest of the cast is good, tough I question of the cast of the prostitutes, or does Heather Graham really strike anyone as 19'th century harlot?From some reason or another all movies based on Alan Moore's brilliant writing fail to capture the essence and the spirit of his works. The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was same kind of disappointment from the same reason. Moore's characterisations are far too bold for typical Hollywood films. They will always fail to portray them right.",5,4,7,3 March 2006
National Treasure," Not original, but decent way to spent a couple of hours
","National Treasure tries its best in two different fields: firstly it tries to be modern Indiana Jones type of an action/adventure film and secondly it tries to cash in with the conspiracy theories about free masons once again popularized by Da Vinci Code. On those both fields the film succeeds better than most combatants.Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) is a treasure hunter after, just like his father and grand father and so on, the biggest treasure of all time: the famed booty of the templars. Ian Howe (Sean Bean) is after the same thing, but he's more savage about his mission, so he's the bad treasure hunter. After Ben and Ian learn, that the map to the treasure is behind one certain piece of paper, that lies heavily guarded in one heavily guarded museum, starts the race of a man, who want's to keep that paper in tact and one who's willing to destroy the paper to get the map.Even tough the movie isn't spoiled with too much originality, a lot is saved by good direction and a great cast, including Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight just to name few. Cage is his usual self, a bit wooden, but out of the treasure hunters Bean, just like he often does, steal all the screen time they share together.So if you are willing to forgive some astonishing leaps of logic and relatively cheesy plot, I see no reason why this wouldn't pass for a decent way top spend a couple of hours. I certainly was a bit surprised of how well this worked in the end.",6,0,3,18 February 2008
Reservoir Dogs," A movie which gave us Tarantino
","In 1992, when I was twelve and had no comprehension about good movies, came Reservoir Dogs, a film, which introduced Quentin Tarantion to the world as a director. Now, if I had seen RD before I had seen Pulp Fiction I would without any doubt claim RD to be Tarantinos best movie. But now, as I have seen Pulp Ficiton before RD I can say 'Well, Reservoir Dogs ain't his best film, but it was extremely good place to start.' Most first directions aren't even 10th as good as Reservoir Dogs.So, Reservoir Dogs is about band or thieves, who are unknown to each other. They are total strangers who are gather up to do a diamond shop heist. They use code names ala Mr. Pink or Mr. Orange. This all, of course, goes terribly wrong. Whole movie is describing the moments before and after the crime, when the dogs are trying to figure out what went wrong and who is to blame.Quentin Tarantinos style is very visible from the first scene to the last, everything is stylish to the last and everything has its own meaning. Nothing happens without a reason, no matter how ridiculous it might be.I don't want to give out any scenes or characters, so I won't dig in any further into the story. Only thing I can say: watch it first before you love or hate it.",8,1,3,21 May 2005
Total Recall," Brutal action from the beginning of 1990's
","I like brutal action movies and Total Recall is just that: bloody and brutal and well directed.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dennis Quid, a construction worker who learns, after a visit to Rekall memory travel office, that his whole life is just a planted memory. Soon everyone is out to get him and he must head to Mars to find out what really is going on.The main level of the story is the action. Arnold and co. swipe baddies from left and right and we are shown these grotesque mutants and special effects.The more subtle level of the story is asking us, if everything shown to us is just a dream, and his wife (Sharon Stone) really wasn't out to kill him. That there really wasn't an ancient martian machinery beneath the surface, no real conspiracy at all. Just a man dreaming.I'm pretty sure Arnold fans like the movie, like I did. Sure it has some glitches and most of the stuff presented in it is pretty unbelievable, but the film works, even though some of the effects are showing their age.",8,0,1,13 November 2005
Pretty Woman," Nice story about love
","Pretty Woman... Pretty Julia Roberts. Charming Richard Gere. Does romantic comedy need anything else? Nah.So, how does it happen, the match between prostitute and a business man? Well in this movie, Edward Lewis (Gere) is lost in LA, so he pick ups Vivianne (Roberts) who promises to take him to his hotel. But then Lewis buys her for the night... which turns to week... which in the end turns forever. So nothing new in that department. Boy gets the girl.Some people could question the morals of the story, as the main characters are cynical businessman and a lady of the night, but then again I recall there is a opera with same kind of story, so it's not a new idea. And it's not like the movie is really promoting for prostitution.'Pretty Woman' is comedy mixed with drama, but it doesn't bare a deep, meaningful message. It's just a love story, naive, pretty love story. Like all of them. And it's very easy to like it.",7,0,2,9 May 2005
Pulp Fiction," A movie deserving its name
","Quentin Tarantion's Pulp Fiction is a movie containing several stories which cross each other in one point or another.Vincent Vega (John Travolta in his comeback role) is an assassin, who has just returned from Europe. He and his associate Jules (always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson) are doing a gig for their boss Marsellus (Ving Rhames). They gotta get back a briefcase, containing something precious.Mia (uma Thurman)is a girlfriend of Marsellus, who is trusted in the care of Vincent in her night out.Butch (Bruce Wills perhaps in one of his best roles) is an aging prize fighter, who has to make his one, last big fight.And Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and pumpkin (Tim Roth) are just two petty robbers, who are about to rob a café.All these stories cut each other in someplace of the film, so it all isn't as random as it might sound like.Dialogue is the key to this film: Tarantino has managed to write conversations about such common thing as giving someone a foot rub, making it interesting and full of views you wouldn't normally think of.But there is more than just dialogue: there's action and some drama and situations, which are so surprising and sudden that you just don't see them coming until they hit you in the face.This all is perfected with good direction and great musical choices.And before I end this rant, I wanted to share my favourite moment with you: Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) gives Butch his family heirloom, left him by his father, who was, and died, in the same Vietcong prison camp Koons was.Top notch film.",9,1,2,21 May 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Rather good fantasy movie.
","Note, that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books written by J.K. Rowling, so I can't really say how this movie compares with it.So, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is left to grow with his eeeevil aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Griffits). They make harry do all the chores, while they pamper their own son. But Harry is not an ordinary boy: he's a wizard and he's been accepted at wizard school of Hogwarts. So of to school we go. At Hogwarts he and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) find out evil plot of Voldemort, ho wants to steal The Philosophers Stone, so he could get himself a body, him being partly dead and all.What was surprising, was that even tough the movie is full of child actors, there isn't any highly annoying case among the cast. And there are many other great actors among adults, like Richard Harris as Dumbledore, head teacher of Hogwarts and Robbie Coltrane as friendly giant Hagrid.Plot is over all very good, mixing fantasy and adventure very well. Visually movie is very good looking, but it does have some wooden looking CGI effects but fortunately they don't effect in the watching pleasure.Over all very good adaptation from the first part of very popular book series.",7,0,2,28 March 2005
Thor," Pretty good introduction movie
","Surprisingly enough Thor isn't a disaster of a movie it could have been. It actually is a pretty strong fantasy/sci-fi tale of one of the more outlandish Marvel characters. The strongest parts of the movie happen outside the Earth, in where the movie treats the audience with poetic and majestic imagery of Asgard and frosty Jotunheim.There was a genuine change, that Thor would have turned out ridiculous piece of crap. It has all the element, which in wrong hands would deliver a movie full of campy comedy gold. But instead of that, a seasoned filmer of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh treats the more fantastical story elements with necessary seriousness and lightness, thus managing to turn the movie into an interesting, yet a bit flawed, introduction of Marvels version of an ancient Nordic deity.As I said before, the most interesting parts of the tale are told outside our fair planet, which serves as a scene of punishment, when Thor is cast away from Asgard, stripped from his powers. The people Thor meets there serve little more else than a path to bring god of Thunder back to Earth in the future Avengers movie. though the banishing of Thor itself is good story.I'd also give a nod to the cast, as the relatively new leads playing Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston) manage to out stage more seasoned Hopkins, who plays their father, Odin. But then again, Earth based characters, such as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) are left very shallow and ultimately uninteresting. On a final note, I saw Thor in 3D and found that to be utterly unnecessary, as while it didn't take anything away, it added very little as well. So if you can, I'd suggest you to see it in regular 2D.",7,0,2,22 May 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Lost of track
","The Matrix had a perfect ending: it left something to ponder and and it was nicely goofy. And I thought it didn't need a sequel of any kind. But then again I knew, that because the film was a hit there would be at least one. And there was two.Reloaded has a nice beginning, after that the movie falls flat on its face and churns itself as a tensionless pseudo philosophical mumbo jumbo about Jesus wannabe Neo (Reeves) and his prophet Morpheus (Fishburne) and Neo's apostle Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). And of course Mr. Smith (Hugo Weaving), the evil agent extraordinare. The biggest problem of the film is total lack of tension: as Neo is this godlike being in the matrix you know, that no matter what, he prevails and that makes the film as tedious to watch as a computer game when you are not playing it. The second problem comes directly from the philosophy of the film: in where the first Matrix the whole thing was more of an existentialism view on world, in Reloaded it all turns out as a bad religious (mainly Christian) reference. It's far too obvious, that The Wachowski Brothers were trying to create something similar to Star Wars.Reloaded turned me off so efficiently, that I still haven't seen the last instalment of the series from the reason I really don't want to. I doubt it will get any better.",5,0,1,10 April 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Too much syrup in the end.
","Effective scenes. That's all this movie is all about. Ron Howard directing scenes as well as he can with great actors. There are even some surprises in the film in the start, but the ending is so typical 'we will overcome' story, that it ruins the pretty and effective scenes of the beginning.Russel Crowe is John Nash, a mathematician with schizophrenia. The films start is all about what is real and what is not. Is Nash really a part of secret government code breaking group or does he just imagine all it and so on and so forth. That really is the best part of the film. After the reality and fiction become separated we are shown so mush syrup, that only Ron Howard is capable of doing that.This film wouldn't work without Crowes performance as disillusioned Nash, but he has great supporting cast. Jennifer Connelly does great job as Nashes' wife, who tries to understand be supportive. Ed Harris has a nice role as secret government agent.As said, effective scenes in the beginning determined the score I gave to this film, but the there just is too much syrup in the ending for me to give bigger score.",7,1,4,25 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Good continuation to the series
","'Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets' continue in the way pointed by the first HP film, being it has the same director and all.HPatCoS goes thorough the second year of Harry's schooling in Hogwarts, this time the menace comes from the chamber mentioned in the title. Woldemort has figured out a way of getting himself a brand new body using that place.Actors are the same as in the first film, though the kids have grown a bit older. That was the reason the makers were in a hurry of making the first two films in a row. The acting is fine and the child actors carry their load through the film rather painlessly, obviously having fun by doing it.Special effects are okay, but not spectacular in all places. The Argog in example isn't the most glorious display of CGI, though it doesn't look completely dreadful, only a bit awkward. But the overall quality of effects is okay, and the gnome Dobby is very well executed little creature.Over all The Chamber of Secrets is a good continuation to the series.",7,0,2,18 April 2006
War of the Worlds," Again mankind gets a lucky break
","'War Of The Worlds' is a classic alien invasion story line, first envisioned by writer H.G. Welles in the 19th century. This time Steven Spielberg has modernized the story line a bit, but other than that, we see the tripods raising from the ground and making havoc around the world.First things first. I didn't much like the dialog in the film. It was pretty cheesy most of the time and people run around like headless chickens. But the action. And the special effects. And the suspension and thrill of those scenes. Spielberg has what it takes and again here he shows, how big budget action needs to be handled.And I quite liked, that Tom Cruise didn't play another perfect hero. He's just trying to get his kids safe, out from the harms way. He doesn't come up with a clever plan to safe humanity, he's too busy trying to safe himself and the kids.The movie starts and ends with a voice over by Morgan Freeman and I have to say, that it just didn't fit in. He sounded too much like god from Bruce Allmighty, when he uttered his phrases.The movie works remarkably well. Time flies watching and even the conclusion is pretty satisfying, even though quite expected. All in all, a good waste of time, better than Independence Day.",7,0,2,29 June 2007
Wedding Crashers," Good comedy in its genre
","Wedding Crashers is, to be truthful, rather typical kind of comedy for its stars: it deals in sex jokes, situation comedy and overall idiocy. And that isn't a bad thing.As it is typical for this genre, the beginning and the middle part are the funniest in this film. There are some milder, dramatic scenes, which of course are necessary from the plot point of view, but are in all rather standard love drama.Cast does a good job in the film. Owen Wilson (John Beckwith) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are funny as two juvenile friends, whose aim in life is to crash weddings in the hopes of getting laid. And they are very successful in that. But then comes the 'different' wedding, where John falls head over heels for Claire (Rachel McAdams), the daughter of U.S. Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken).'Wedding Crashers' is funnier than most of the comedies of its genre. Last comedy of this type I liked was the 'Anchorman' by Will Ferrel, who does a small role in this film too. So with that as a guide line I'll leave you to decide do you want to see this or not.",7,1,4,26 May 2006
The Last King of Scotland," The escaping doctor and the paranoid president
","'The Last King of Scotland' is no way a perfect movie, but it is a great movie none the less. After a rather typical beginning for a movie, that is based on a rather generic beginning of a young white man going somewhere out of a whim, the movie really kicks in a high gear. The gear is, when Forest Whitaker is seen in his first big scene as Idi Amin, charismatic, yet paranoid dictator of Uganda.So this young man, doctor Nicholas Garrigan (brilliantly portrayed by James McAvoy), is trying to escape his life as a future family doctor and thus by an act of faith ends up in a hospital in Uganda. There he has a crush on the local doctors wife Sarah (Gillian Anderson) and so he decides, when the opportunity calls, to enter in the position of Amin's personal doctor. Troubles soon enter his life in the form of Amin's beautiful wife Kay (Kerry Washington).From what I first thought seemed to be a rather typical historic drama, I was surprised of the intensity of the movies latter half, or actually two thirds. The most generic display of Africa is really in the first half hour of the movie. Superior acting, good script and great direction makes tLKoS very enjoyable, and in some places very gruesome, experience. I have to give the nod towards Whitaker and say, that his Oscar win was truly deserved, as he was truly mesmerizing in his role.My final score 8 out of 10",8,4,5,26 February 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not a bad comedy, not at all
","In the olden days of television all the news anchors where manly men, who were idolized by everyone who watched news. The most manly of all was Ron Burgundy (Will Farfrel) who is challenged by a beautiful Veronica (Christina Applegate), who intends to be the first female anchor.Most funny jokes are drawn from the 'macho culture' of the news group (gang fights between different news groups and such) and the chauvinistic attitude of the other male members of the news group.AS for comedies go 'Anchorman' is filled with different kinds of characters, which of some work or are just unnecessary in some aspect.Perhaps not the best comedy ever made, but certainly worth a view.",7,0,1,31 July 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Existential comedy
","Harold Crick (Will Ferrel) is an ordinary man with nothing special about him. He's a punctual tax man, who's life is not going anywhere fast. And on one day he begins to hear a narration inside his head, that seems to be a narrative of things he's just done. And when the narrator gets into a spot, where she says, that Harold Crick is about to die, he decides to look help from a literary professor Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who advices to take notes of the narratives in order to figure out what kind of a story he's in.So as Harold is trying to figure out if his budding romance with Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and his life in general is a tragedy or a comedy, his narrator, struggling writer Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is trying her hardest to figure out how in earth he could kill Harold off.'Stranger Than Fiction' is surprisingly heart warming, well acted, written and directed light drama comedy, that manages to keep you in its grasp to the very end. Will Ferrel does a great job as Crick and his performance isn't shadowed a bit from the performances of rest of the talented cast. STF is one of those films, in which everything seems to click together with ease and it just has the general feel of a film, that everyone involved was doing because they wanted to do it.",9,0,0,1 March 2009
The Wrestler," Well played sport movie
","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is a pro-wrestler, who has seen his better days in the 80's, trying to make ends meet with small scale wrestling shows and part time job at a store warehouse. Randy is a man, who lives in the past, retelling his glory days to anyone, who is willing to listen. Randy is a man, who has ruined his relationship with his only daughter and who's closest human relationship is with a stripper Cassidy.The Wrestler could be another Rocky style sports movie. The premise, while revolving around a bit more absurd world of pro wrestling, is a bit similar. But Darren Aronofsky doesn't go there; The Ram doesn't end up as a similar underdog hero as Rocky did, because Randy is just that kind of a guy.Aronofsky directs his well cast movie with a firm hand, nicely avoiding the most common clichés of every sports movie. Rourke does a great role as Randy. He feels at home in the role and you can't help but to compare The Ram to Rourke himself, as he has had his own falling out from the limelights. Also Marisa Tomei does nice and down to earth role as Cassidy, the love interest of Randy. She is both tough and fragile as a woman, who sees the both sides of Randy.The Wrestler is same time both, a typical and untypical sport movie. It goes the well threaded paths but at the same time it manges to avoid the common clichés by just being more sincere and honest than most movies manage to be. There's no beating up pig carcasses here, there's just the contrast between reality and a dream.",9,2,2,17 May 2011

That's why I was surprised, that I didn't like the film. There are more misses than strikes in the jokes and, though I did got couple of laughs, the timing of the jokes is mostly very bad and the acting is obnoxious rather than funny.Film has some pretty good actors, but unfortunately the jokes just don't work even with them. Like Bill Murry, who succeeds in being totally bore in the film. Vanessa Angel is used only as a dumb bimbo / angry bitch joke. The breast punching bag scene is a biggest miss I've seen in any comedy.For me there was only one laughing out loud joke and a couple of smirks, but in all, I was more bored than entertained.",4,0,4,23 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Unbalanced story with great ending
","This movie definitely has its moments, in fact some scenes in it are the best of what George Lucas has ever directed in his life. And some of the music edited in those scenes is best what John Williams has to offer.But this movie has problems, big, big problems.First of all, the beginning. Yes, it looks good. Amazing even, but the way it was edited together and the dialog delivered during that huge battle made me question the exact need of the scene: I came in conclusion, that it was there just as a show off, nothing more.Secondly: some were tacky and wooden acting. And the dialog. In some places it's so horrible, that you feel like laughing. And usually for wrong reasons.But, I would like to say here, that there is good acting too. There is scenes in the movie, where everything just click in very well and the abilities of the cast really shows off. Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), Natalie Portman (Padme) have some great scenes, which end up saving the over all movie.Anakin's (Hayden Christensen) turn to Darth Vader is told very clearly, it's made sure, that no one misses the points of his fall. And no matter what the general consensus about this is, I still feel Hayden is very good choice to as Anakin: he plays the part of an arrogant man, who believes he has the ultimate power.So, here's a summary: In start I felt a bit numb because of one too many underlining, poorly written talk sequences, but in the end it was more rewarding, it just is, that all the good things are left in the end.",7,2,4,26 May 2005
Inception," A solid sci-fi action from Nolan
","Dreams and reality, being awake and dreaming. In a sense both states are just as real, when you experience them, but dreams are more fickle, as even they seem real at the time, the moment we awake those memories which just moments ago were so vivid, crumble into nonsensical images, that escape your thoughts at the moment you are fully awake. But still, you can remember those images and dreams. They linger behind your subconscious and can jump out suddenly. They can be a seed for an idea.That is something Christopher Nolan explores with his masterfully directed Inception. True enough, I don't think it's his best movie to date, but it is well made in all aspects. The cast is solid and the script has very few weaknesses in it. But still there was something in it, which I can't yet put my finger on, that just didn't clicked with me.Saito (Ken Watanabe) hires Cobb (Leanardo DiCaprio) to insert an idea to the mind of his competitor (Cillian Murphy). This is done by entering the subjects dreams and trying to make the subject believe, that the idea comes from him and no one else. This is a good premises for a movie, that happens in a multiple levels of human consciousness, such providing a playground for spectacular action and visuals.Entering some ones dreams isn't easy. To do that, they need an architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), to construct a dream world so real, that the subject doesn't suspect a thing. Other players in the dream are Cobbs ensemble of trusted men, such as Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Eams (Tom Hardy), who from their part try to keep the subjects defenses occupied.All in all, Inception is one of the best movies this summer, there's no weak link among the cast and the movie rolls on like a steam train. Nolan has managed to direct an ambitious Hollywood movie, which is full of originality. By itself the feat is remarkable, though not quite a home run.",9,2,7,31 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Good take on a classic character
","Sherlock Holmes has fascinated me as a character for ages. Despite I've begun to read the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle just recently the character of Holmes has been familiar to me through movies and TV-series. Personally I don't mind variation from the source what comes to adaptations, but there's couple of things which need to be present in a Holmes story: his keen intellect, superiority over foes and of course Watson. And all these things are present as well the trait of Holmes to do first and then reveal his plan to the viewer (or reader).So in this new version of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey JR.) our master detective is against a conspiracy coined by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) and together with Dr. Watson (Jude Law) and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) he must stop this seemingly supernatural fiend.As it is with Holmes he's deeply rational man who is not fooled by mere superstition while others may be blinded with sleigh of hand. So we see him outsmarting people left and right and the story ends with a cliffhanger with the looming threat of Moriarty in the future.Guy Ritchie has assembled a fine cast, but the structure of the movie is a bit troubled. The story begins strong and it has great scenes through out, but there are some parts in it which feel like the makers had run out of steam and ideas. At first I also did find the sound track a bit distracting, but it did start to work better towards the end. All in all Sherlock Holmes gets better towards the end, so it ended up as a pretty entertaining movie.",7,0,0,15 February 2010
Prometheus," Scott's stunning return to sci-fi
","Seeing Prometheus left me in a stunned silence. For a moment I sat in my seat and thought to myself: 'What have I just seen?' After a moment of silence I asked myself 'Is this a good or a bad question?' And in all honesty I enjoyed of what I saw, Scott taking me for a ride in the future, playing around, teasing me with oh so familiar bits and pieces from Alien. In many places Scott dangles the bait, winking, 'see, this is Alien... but it is not. And then again it is.' Visually Prometheus is stunning. Scott proves that he's not just at the top of his game, but he has given everything to create Prometheus a visually astonishing movie despite the alien planet is visually less interesting than some other alien worlds. But that bleakness of a dying world is mesmerizing and Gigers designs are just as pleasing as they've always been.Basic story is as simple as it gets: We go somewhere we shouldn't have and we pay the price. But in this simple story Scott asks some grand questions, which he doesn't answer. And those grand ideas are what left me stunned.I don't know if Prometheus will become a classic such as Alien is. But what matters is, that Scott still has it and he is much bolder than many other sci-fi directors out there. He doesn't want to let you go to the world where good and bad are basic concepts. Everything is, in the end, gray matter.",7,5,16,6 June 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Not as good as the first, but not bad either.
","When I was younger I always thought, that the part two of the Back To The Future series was funniest film of the bunch. But now I've come to reconsider this, and become in a conclusion, that the first one is a lot funnier than the sequel.Don't get me wrong, BTTF2 is fun and well made flick, and it does carry on the candle very well, so there's nothing wrong about it. It's just it hasn't taken the time as well as the first film.Biggest draw back are the special effects, the flying cars, which are far too clearly just that: special effects. My biggest nit pick about them is, that in some places there are notable light differences on them and they stick out too well from the film, but they are luckily mostly well done.The script isn't as good as it was in the first film, but the time continuity issues are as fun as ever. You really could tie your brains into a knot, if you would think about them seriously for a while.The film starts right from where the first one ended: Marty (Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) go in the future to stop their kids to be from goofing around. But it's not just that, there is something else in the past that must be stopped from happening.As I said, my biggest nit pick is about the effects, but other than that there isn't nothing wrong about the film. It's enjoyable and very funny in places. It's just not as good as the first one.",8,1,2,11 February 2006
1408," nicely told horror story
","Stephen King filmatisations rarely work, in fact I have enjoyed only maybe three of movies based on his works, at least from the ones I've seen. So that's why 1408 was such a pleasant surprise for me, as I really did like it and it didn't have the feeling of unnecessary dragging that most of the films based on King's novels have.In it's core 1408 is pretty basic story of a tortured soul, writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack), who investigates and writes about ghost invested places of America. One day he checks into a hotel Dolphin, that has a room, that the director of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), describes as one evil room. As usual Enslin doesn't believe a word that is said about the room, but soon enough he notices, that there indeed is something in there. Or then again it all might be in his head.1408 is effective and well woven yarn, that mainly slips into the territory of supernatural drama than your standard generic slasher horror film.",8,0,0,1 March 2009
Vanilla Sky," Awakenings
","What is a line between dream and reality? Can we see dreams, believing them to be real? And if so, can we awake in a dream to figure out, that all around us is just an illusion, cleverly constructed by our sub conscious?Those couple questions sprung in my mind after I watched Vanilla Sky. It's rather interesting movie really, but it does have very poorly written and boring beginning as a romantic drama starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Story it self turns good after the car crash. Then it really starts to examine reality if David Aames (Tomi Cruise), who gets his face mashed up, but who still manages to find love of Sofia Serrano (Cruz).Cruz is great as she always is. You just gotta love that accent. Other actress deserving praise is Cameron Diaz, who play Julianne Gianni, a occasional lady friend of David. She was amazing in that part. Tom Cruise became good actor after he made 'Eyes Wide Shut' for Stanley Kubrick. That was the movie, which proved, that Cruise can act besides just being a pretty boy. That was just to say, that Cruise does helluva good role as Aames in Vanilla Sky. Could say, that he manages to keep the movie in surface.Oh, and Kurt Russel does nice job as Aames's psychiatrist McCabe. Now to the weak points of the movie. As I said it is partly very weakly written, especially the beginning, which is just boring and mundane. Then there is the direction of Cameron Crowe. He honestly isn't that great. He's not bad, but there are several moments in the film that could do some tightening up, I refer on the beginning here.Overall a decent movie. Above average.",7,0,1,13 March 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," A good finale for Nolan Batman trilogy
","I never saw the finale of Nolan's Batman trilogy in a theater. I was put off by the inclusion of Bane, who never has been my favorite character, so I, consciously or not, never saw it. I just couldn't muster the interest. And now I finally saw it I must admit that The Dark Knight Rises was much, much better movie than I expected it to be.Nolan took a character I care very little about and managed to tie him into his trilogy. In this movie Bane is a follower of Ra's Al Ghul, who is trying to finish what Batman stopped Ra's doing in the first movie: destroy Gotham. This he plans to do with the help of power generator Bruce Wayne has financed.The opening of tDKR is not as strong as the opening of the Dark Knight. As a movie tDKR is not as strong either, but it's not a bad movie, nor a bad way for Nolan to finish what he started with Batman Begins.Just like in the two previous movie the cast in tDKR is very strong. The old faces, Caine, Oldman, Freeman and Bale do their respective roles with routine and at places Bale's growling starts to be borderline silly, but he still manages to pull his Batman to the end without turning him into a complete joke. Tom Hardy does good job as Bane and Anne Hathaway fills in nicely the tight suit of Catwoman. All in all the movie works well in most levels. There's some problematic dialog, that doesn't quite work, but after the movie kicks in the high gear that really ceases to be a problem.But now, that Nolan has ended his supposedly more reality rooted Batman series I'd love to see Batman taken back in less serious world. The Batman comics are full of colorful villains, that couldn't be explored in Nolans world, but now that he's done, the time could be ripe to bring in the even more fantastical elements of Batman.",8,2,3,20 July 2013
Blade Runner," A visual masterpiece
","I was rather young when I saw 'Blade Runner' for the first time, no more than 10 or so, I think. It was among the first serious science fiction films I saw and it has stayed with me ever since, for I, for the lack of a better word, love it with its flaws. As if I'd give a totally unbiased review of the film, I wouldn't give it a full ten, as I've done now.'Blade Runner' tells a tale of a man named Deckard (Harrison Ford), a detective of a Blade Runner Unit, which sole purpose is to retire replicants, human like androids, which may acquire emotions during their four year operation time, which in turn may get them to cause mayhem around them. That is the same reason replicants are outlawed in Eareth, but some of them may try to come here. That's where the BR unit comes in. So four of them are out there, trying get to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And here's the cue for Deckard, in pursuit of those four, before they manage to do any bigger damage.The first thing that jumps out is, that despite being over 20 years old, Blade Runner still has stunning visual effects, that show no sign of aging. We see views of Los Angeles, with sky scraping towers of concrete and steel, pushing out gas explosions. The humongous splendor and size of Tyrell corp, which we then can compare against crowded streets, lit with endless rows of neon signs. The city is as important character than anyone else in the movie. Upon that visual splendor is the soundtrack done by Vangelis. A soundtrack, that set the mood perfectly, along with the sound effects.But even the greatest effects are nothing without a good cast, and that is something Blade Runner has. Rutger Hauer does a great job as Roy, the leader of the renegade replicants. He' accompanied by Daryl Hannah (Pris), Brion James (Leon) and Joanna Cassidy (Zhora). Out of the replicants Zhora is left for least of the attention. On the opposing side there's Gaff (Edward James Olmos), an eccentric detective and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in the story, thanks to Olmos's dedication to the job, and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), an old fashioned chief of the BR unit. And finally there's Rachel (Sean Young), Tyrells secretary, who doesn't fully know herself.There are plot holes and such it BR, I don't deny that, but as I've said, I love the film with its flaws. The acting, atmosphere and directing is so strong, that I just don't mind those flaws at all, when I'm sucked into this philosophical tale of questions about humanity and what it is like to be a human.I've said a lot, but really I have't said nothing important. I leave it for you to decide do you like it and which out of the 5 official versions you like the prefer, if you prefer any.",10,0,1,13 April 2008
Casino Royale," The Bond Begins
","There was an absurd uproar, when it was announced, that Pierce Brosnan wouldn't be Bond anymore. The uproar continued, and it even got a bit more absurd, if that's even possible, when Daniel Craig was announced as Bond, mainly because Craig isn't anything like his predecessors; he's muscular, blond, blue-eyed and bit brutish in looks. But all the same to me, I'm not a hardcore Bond fan, I know there's been five different actors before him and in the end only thing that matters is, that the acting works and the film is good. And for these points the movie delivers.Now Craig is Bond you've never seen before, well Dalton was a bit like him, but Craig is more arrogant, more self aware and colder. He's something you'd expect a double 0 agent to be. And he's not indestructible man with a gadget to safe him in every turn. There actually are few gadgets in the film and these few are in the realm of believe. And it is evident, that Craig has charisma, that appeals to women, at least that was the general consensus among the ones I saw the movie with.The action is greatly constructed from the first scene to the last. From the acrobatic Parkoire escape to the drowning Venize building it all works and makes you sit on the edge of your chair. Bond shoots and beats the thugs and occasionally blows them away and it all is entertaining and yet the film is more down to earth than the previous movies, when the action is in question.Only minus I found from the film is, that it really is a bit too long. A couple of scene feel too forced in and clichÃ©d. The film could have been two hours long without any feel of unnecessary loss of story.In all I finally understand why 'Casino Royale' is the most successful Bond at this moment: it breaks the formula of the genre, it genuinely is different, like Dalton's Bond tried to be in the 80's. Bond has been upgraded to fit today and that isn't a bad thing. Unless you want that old formulaic movie, in which case it might be better for you to skip this one and get back to oldies.",8,0,3,28 December 2006
Signs," Interesting take on crop circles.
","I laughed a lot when I watched this movie. It has lots and lots of hilarious scenes and lots of unintentionally funny stuff in it. And, if you were wondering, it doesn't have any really scary scenes in it. But then again, it's more about the faith and family of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Graham is this priest, who has lost his faith after his wife had died in a car accident. Now he's living with his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One day huge crop circles appear on their field. Then they notice that strange things start to happen all around the world.Signs relies much on slow narration and it's own quirky atmosphere. There are TV reports shown all over the movie, which work as testimonials of the truthfulness of the situation, it's not in their imagination.Well, in all, I cannot recommend this movie, if you want fast scares or lots of action. But if you like slower narration and not so obvious plot line this is for you.",7,1,4,29 May 2005
Identity," Tight, neat little puzzle.
","10 strangers drift from one reason or another into a small motel in the middle of a desert during a heavy storm. Suddenly people start ending up dead and the chase for the murderer begins.There's nothing new in this particular plot line as such, there are lots of this kind of stories ranging from the books of Agatha Christie to dozens of adaptations and transmutation of the story in different media. So, as it often is, it's the way the story is constructed and how the twist is made.It often happens, that this genre gives out so much rope, that it hangs itself, but this doesn't happen with 'Identity'. Despite of some pretty old clichés the movie delivers very enjoyable experience, which explains pretty neatly everything that has happened in the story.It far too easy to say too much about this genre and spoil the fun for the viewers, so I keep this as tight as possible. They enjoyment of the puzzle is laid before your eyes and it is a tasty one.A short summary of what is stated above: very good addition to the genre it presents.",8,0,1,22 September 2006
Beowulf," Nicely told story despite its visual flaws
","A monster Grendel is terrorizing the kingdom of king Hogarth. The vile beast must be slain and lo and behold, Beowulf, the great hero, comes with his men and he slays the monster by ripping its arm off. But the monster has a mother and as it also wants to revenge the death of her offspring, Beowulf must kill her as well.Beowulf is well written and well told story. It has a solid soundtrack and some pretty bad ass action scenes as well some nicely twisted sense of humour. Yet I can't give it more than 7 out of 10.The main reason for this is the way the movie has been made. The CGI looks great and the the makers have managed to bring a great deal of atmosphere to Denmark. But the characters seem lifeless and the animation seem very awkward in some places and there are even a couple of scenes in which the animation is plain bad. Ray Winstone does a good voice job, but there are some characters whose voice acting is plain and uninspired. Yes, I'm talking about John Malkovich here. And Anthony Hopkins ain't in his A game here either.But as I said it is very well told and written story. I especially liked what they had done with Grendel. He's not just some brainless monster, but a pathetic, twisted shell, who is in constant pain. Even though he does terrible things you can't but to feel sorry for him because of the sins of his parents.",7,1,2,31 January 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Flawed , yet reasonably fun
","In theory Thor: The Dark World is a great movie. In this theory it's a great sci-fi epic about beings that look like viking gods. In practice though it is not a great movie as much as it is a deeply flawed movie with some very nice individual scenes in it.The biggest problem T:tDW has is, that it is a Marvel movie and just like very other Marvel movie it does its best to make the viewers remember that they are in fact watching a Marvel movie. This leads into nudges and winks towards the other movies in Marvel's arsenal, which in this case make the movie feel a bit disjointed as it assumes that the viewer has already seen those. It also means that the characters don't really get that much flesh in their stories as the writing clearly seems to assume that someone else is going to flesh out the characters more in somewhere else. That's why the movie is filled with familiar faces whom a casual viewers might have very hard time identifying with, as they have no inkling who those many faces are and what is their significance.TtDW is a fun movie none the less. It is more or less forgettable sequel to a relatively forgettable movie in the first place, but just like the first movie it is reasonably well done to fill its purpose of entertainment. Sadly though it could have been so much more, but in the end that wasn't in the cards.",6,0,1,12 July 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end
","The Return of The king begins with a flashback of Gollum, when he recalls how he got the ring and how it turned him into what he is now. I really didn't expect a beginning like that. After that the movie continues from where we were left in The Two Towers.There is, in my opinion, no need to mention any other, as I have praised their work in my comments of previous movies, actors besides John Noble, who does without any doubt excellent job as Denethor, mad steward of Gondor, who in his grief for his oldest son Boromir (Sean Bean) cannot see the love of his youngest son Faramir (David Fenham).Isengard has fallen, but the dark lord Sauron still remains in his strong hold, behind the walls of Mordor. He is soon launching a full-scale attack towards Gondor. And if he were to win, that would mean fall of the human race.I was very exited to see TROTK and I was, I admit it, little bit scared, as the book is a massive story, with multiple story lines. Could Jackson tie them all together again? Over three hours later I was convinced: he could. But I still was little disappointed: there were scenes missing, like what happened to Saruman (Christopher Lee)? Where was his final confrontation whit Gandalf (Ian McKellen)? But I knew the EE was coming and I was confident, that everything would be in there. But still I was certain of one thing: I had seen one of the most stunning cinematic displays of my life.And my confidence was rewarded: more about pathway of the dead, Sarumans last stand in Isengard, meeting with Mouth of Sauron. It all was in there. Some scenes were just to add some lighthearted fun in the story some were more serious. Some, I admit, I could have lived without, but then again they did made me laugh out loud.After I had all the EE versions of the films, me and my friend spent a day watching those all films in a row. The trilogy was complete, all my fears were gone and last thing for me to do is lay back and enjoy.",10,6,9,22 May 2005
The Truman Show," Reality TV
","Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) lives on a small town of Seahaven, is married to a pretty nurse Meryl (Laura Linney) and has a job as an insurance sales man. He's afraid of water because an accident that drowned his father and he is generally very well liked among the people of his little community. Yet he dreams of going away.One day a series of curious incidents lead him to believe there's something strange about his environment, like if the whole world is revolving around him. And funnily enough it is: Truman is, with out his own knowledge, a start of a reality show, that had begun the very day he was born. Among unwanted babies he was chosen to be a star of the Truman Show, a live broadcast viewed by millions of people all around the world, dreaming of more simple world they live in.The Truman Show is a well woven satire about the extremities of reality television. Despite it feels like a show revolving around a single clueless individual would be far fetched, it doesn't feel like that at all, when you compare it to a stream of 'reality' nonsense in the TV today. While the movie itself comes a tale of a man, who is trying to travel to the edge of his own reality, the other aspects of the movie good deal of criticism and very justified questions about the whole nature of reality TV graze.All in all the cast is solid and does a very good job. Ed Harris is especially good as Christof, megalomaniac director/creator of the show, who is trying his hardest to keep Truman in his place. Jim Carrewy gives one of his best performances, showing he can do serious work, if given good enough script to work with. While the music is used sparingly, the soundtrack contains some very memorable tunes.The Truman Show is one of those movies I usually watch from beginning to the end, if I happen to catch it from the TV. It is very well made movie and I would even consider it a classic on its own right.",9,0,1,27 December 2009
The Matrix," Redefinition of action
","I remember seeing 'The Matrix' for the first time. I knew it was going to be some kind of sci-fi flick, which of all the people I knew raved about. I had my doubts; it's rare, that movies live up to their hype.The first action scene with Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) defines the whole film: expect unexpected. Actually the very first action scene did redefine action movie genre all together with slick camera movement and freeze time shots. It all is visual eye candy, which has been designed to make you as the viewer gasp your breath.The story goes, that hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) is seeking for truth. He want's to know what is the Matrix. Soon he is taken for a drive by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity and he learns that the world is not what it seems. Then there are the bad guys, lead by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his troop of men in black. In the mix there are thrown pits and pieces from various existential philosophy courses and Jesus and Judas theme is strongly present. A kind of modern semi religious/philosophical mix. Not meant to be taken too seriously, even tough some people seem to do so.I am actually very interested of seeing, how this movie will last the time. Will it be taken as a new 'Star Wars' or will it just fade away and become a cult classic. There is no knowing that.But, my recommendation: Lean back and kick your feet up. Munch some popcorn and enjoy, it's easy with this film.",8,0,1,7 May 2005
Godzilla," Better than the 1998 movie and relatively enjoyable disaster movie
","I've never been a huge Godzilla fan myself. Just like with the another big cinema monster, King Kong, I can see the appeal, but the 'giant monster' genre has never really been my cup of tea. So in that extent I have no means to tell if this particular movie is a travesty towards the ol' nuclear lizard.In this new Godzilla, the lizard king itself is an ancient monster from the more radiated past of the Earth. As the radiation has cooled down Godzilla and its kind went to the deep ocean or in deep slumber inside the Earth. Until the day humans found atomic power. The human meddling with the atom causes parasitic giant creatures to submerge from their slumber and soon the world is suffering in the claws of the monstrous destruction, which goes even further when the ancient enemy of the monsters, King Kong arrives to whoop some ass.While, just like every other disaster movie, Godzilla is trying to bring a human element to the story in the form of a father Joe (Bryan Cranston) a son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his family and a monster researcher Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), that human element is just as obsolete it is in any other disaster movie. The main course of the movie is the destruction the monsters can cause, the mayhem and the spectacle of it. And boy, does this movie do the spectacle well.But as the human element is pretty much stock material for a movie like this, I couldn't help but to feel in many places that this Godzilla movie is just way too long. It uses a lot of time in order to convince that we should care about the humans, but just like in almost every disaster movie before this it is pretty hard to care about stock caricatures.As far disaster movies go, I've seen much worse. But at the same time I can't really say this Godzilla has sparked my interest to go to the Japanese Godzilla's either. But at least it's better than that utterly horrible 1998 movie with Matthew Broderick, so I guess that's something at least.",7,0,0,1 July 2015
Ran," The mad king
","Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is an old clan leader of Ichimonji clan. He decides to give up his control to his oldest son Taro (Akira Terao), which is like a knife in the back of his middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu). Only his youngest son Sabaru (Daisuke Ryu)tries to beg his father to reconsider: he knows what will happen. But no, Hidetora driven by his guilt of his murderous deeds during his rise to power wants to throw the towel in and to give peace a change, which he believes his oldest son will grand, and so maddened from the harsh words of Sabaru, he casts away his youngest son. But soon, it is discovered, that Taro and Jaro both want total control of the area. So begin the battle between two brothers, driving old Hidetora insane. In the middle Taros wife Kaede (Mieko Harada) prays the lives of Ichimonji clans brothers like a black widow. People say, that Ran is Kurosawas adaptation of Shakespeares play King Lear. I wouldn't know that, being that I've never read it. So I'll just take their word on it.Whole plot is full of schemes and conspiracies: everyone is on everyones death list. Very deep drama mixed with bloody battle scenes. And I am not talking about Hollywood type action, but far more brutal type of action, in style of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Acting is overall very good, tough like it is always in my case, I have this small cultural shock between Japanese actors and European/American ones. But it usually quickly wears off. Good actors are good, no matter the language.Direction of the whole movie is very good and cinematography is just stunning and full of colours. All images are extremely vivid and lush. Beaty mixed with violence. A combination, which is tried by many directors, but usually in vain, but Kurosawa carries it off almost painlessly.There's also lots of scenes with lots of extras running all about. In fact it took two years to make all the costumes for this flick, so make your calculations about the amount of all the extras in the flick.All in all very stunning movie, in fact I even dare to say, RAN is one of the finest made by Kurosawa.",9,0,2,10 April 2005
Fantastic Four," Pretty mediocre
","I know very little about the Fantastic Four. Basically what I know is their powers and how they got them and that they have one of the most interesting main villains in their hands, Dr. Doom. But that's about it, as I never did find their comics very appealing.Considering what I've heard about this movie I was expecting a total catastrophe, but it really wasn't. It was just rather mediocre in every level, not terrible, but not really that great either. The plot didn't have any real sense of excitement and even when the groups powers were revealed to the public the instant acceptation they got was just weird little moment with no question or ifs. They were just embraced instantly.Other flaw that springs in my mind about the logic of the story is the rather peculiar logic of things. Like in the scene in which Human Torch first time lights up. The end of that scene really doesn't make much sense in any level.There are some things that work pretty well. The jokes are well timed and I chuckled out loud in a couple of occasions and just as I expected, the Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) turned out to be my favorite character.All in all, in comparison to the best Marvel films out there, Spider-man franchise, Fantastic Four is pretty half baked effort.",5,0,1,20 December 2008
Sin City," Best comic book adaptation I've seen
","Welcome to the Basin City, also known as Sin City, where women are pretty and booze is cheap. Welcome in the Sin City, where women are deadly. Sin City, where being good means to be bad. To be good in any means possible, because the men who are bad make Manson look like a kitty cat.Whole base of Sin City, Fank Miller's graphical novels, are hard boiled, over the edge action, film noir influenced stories, in where even the most good men and women are capable of murder.The movie is told in three separate stories, which have nothing to do whit each other, expect the fact that they are based in The Sin City. Each story is too short to work as a separate film, but in three separate segments, starring different people, they give out very good image of what is Sin City: revenge of the innocent, revenge for the loved ones, protection of the innocent.Marv (Mickey Rourke) is on his way to avenge the dead of Goldie (Jaimie King), only woman who has ever loved him. Hartigan (Bruce Wills), a stand up cop in the City Of Sin, is jailed after stepping in too big toes, after saving Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a pedophile murderer Junior (Nick Stahl). And finally Dwight (Clive Owen) is trying to stop a war between police, the mafia and the old town hookers. As I said, these stories do not link up, even though there are some characters shown in the background of the other stories, there is minimal or none interaction between them. Each story roll in the end and after it's over the next one begins.Visually Sin City is stunning, black and white, with some colored patches in here and there, like the babe wearing a red dress in the beginning or the blue eyes of Becky (Alexis Bidel). Blood is almost in all cases white, sometimes red and in one case yellow. But the action is always brutal, and sometimes even cartoony. The flick is actually filled with dark and twisted humor. At least the people in the theater were laughing, as was I.There are lots of other stars as well in the movie, in fact the cast is impressive. All the parts are very surprising, like Elijah Wood as Kevin, a mute psychopath living under the protective wing of Cardinal Raork, played by Rutger Hauer. As for the final stars, I cannot give out ten, because there were some actors that bothered me, like Jessica Alba, who is without any doubt a beautiful woman, but her acting as Nancy left room for improvement. Sin City is the best comic adaptation I've seen to date: it sets new limits in both visual and in acting. The only thing I'm hoping, that directors wont start copying Rodriguez/Miller style mindlessly as happened whit Tarantinos style.Speaking of directors, there has been lots of commission about Tarantino being a special quest director. I found that his influence was barely visible and not the worth of the whole ruckus, it was just a marketing trick nothing more in my opinion, but it doesn't take anything from the movie: it stays as Miller's vision. And Rodriguez's.",9,4,8,28 July 2005
Gangs of New York," Nicely told story of mixed elements.
","In the 19th century New York gangs of immigrants and born Americans battle ferociously against each other in order to secure a place for themselves in a golden land of opportunity. 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) is a leader of Dead Rabbits gang, formed of Irish, and Bill 'Butcher' Cutting (Danie Day Lewis) is a leader of opposing Natives gang, that is determined to drive the foreign influence out of the country.Vallon is killed in a battle, but his son Amsterdamn (Leonardo Di Caprio) is left alive to vow vengeance against the Buthcer.When I saw 'GoNY' the first time I didn't like it that much, I thought it okay, but nothing more, but later on after a couple of reviews I've warmed up to it much more. Visually speaking the film is very solid piece of work and the old New York looks stunning and the atmosphere is thick and intriguing, as are the multiple character of the story, starting from the Butcher and corrupt politicians to Amsterdams love interest Jenny (Cameron Diaz).The movie flows in somewhere between Shakespearen drama, epic and historical depiction, never really setting itself on any of them, but nicely revolving around them, borrowing elements from here and there, how ever the situation needs. This allows Scorcese to deliver rather stylish looking story about history, revenge and forgiveness.All in all, Gangs of New York is a good film, which might take more than one viewing for it to open up fully.",8,0,0,19 October 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Insanity like no other
","I don't think I can come up with any original praises for Mad Mad: Fury Road. People have complimented it far better than I ever could, so my short review of the restart of the series that begun in the already distant late 1970's is, that I liked it more than I have liked any action movie in a long while. George Miller has managed to create a movie, that manages to grab you from the first minute and doesn't let you go until the end credits start to roll.Now, for a bit different view. I saw the movie with my older brother, who said, that while he liked the movie, he also thought it wasn't as good as people have made it to be. As he put it, he was glad that he saw it, but he wasn't in a hurry to see it again.What is undeniable though is the amount of insanity Miller has managed to bring to the screen. This time Mad Max, played by Tom Hardy, is more feral as a character than he was when Mel Gibso was playing him. Max is also not the only competent road warrior, as Furiosa (brillianty bad ass Charlize Theron) makes the life more than enough difficult for the villain Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).The world of Mad Max has gone even more insane in this new installment. Every scene is filled with oddity and madness. Immortan Joe rules with an iron fist, and water, but has also surrounded himself with his slowly mutating children and insane troops of drugs sniffing war boys. Furiosa steals something of his, the wives and breeding stock of Joe, and this starts the relentless, feverish chase across the desert sands. The plot is simple and people don't talk much. Thins are explained with few words that don't always even end up being sentences. But the looks and the expressions of the characters are more than telling. The main driver is the visual storytelling that movies can be at their best and in this Miller has managed to create a modern master piece.Mad Max: Fury Road is an action movie, that shows modern action directors how action should be done. Action is clear and easy to follow, yet it makes you grab you hand rests. The settings, despite their wasteland bleakness, are stunning and instead of over use of CGI, most of the daring stunts have been done with practical effects.I can't promise that MM:FR is a movie for everyone. No matter how much it has been praised doesn't automatically mean that it is a movie that everyone would like. But at the same time I do recommend to give it a try, as even if you don't end up loving it, you may end up liking it.",9,4,12,29 May 2015
Warcraft," Warcraft is surprisingly good
","Considering the reviews Warcraft: The Beginning has received and the general consensus of thinking that video game based movie aren't very good, I was fully expecting to see some what of a cinematic pan cake. Surprisingly enough, Warcraft works pretty well. It's no LOTR mind you, but it is relatively entertaining, at places a bit cheesy, fantasy flick with pretty good special effects.Warcraft is at its best when it revolves around the orcs. The humans are really the weak link of the whole thing, as very few of the actors chosen feel that they don't fit in a fantasy setting like this. A Finnish director Markku Pölönen said once, that some people have epoch faces and some do not. By that he meant, that certain people suit better on a movie set in the past (or in a fantasy world), where as some just look too modern. Most of the human actors here feel a bit too modern for the setting. Also the writing on the humans side feels more rushed.But the orcs. Now they're fantastic. They're gigantic beast, with tusks and huge weapons in their hands, riding on over sized wolves (or wargs, I'm not really sure, as I'm not huge Warcraft guy). The orcs themselves aren't really evil at all, they're just misguided by the fell magic using Gul'Dan. In any case, the movie just seems to work better every time there's orcs on scree, be it Durotan, Garona or Gul'dan.The pacing of the story is also a one big issue. It's easy to see, that there's a lot of story material been cut out from the movie and that really feels like it's hurting the overall experience. Some additional material might even make the humans feel more compelling as well, but now there's no real connection to them here, as the story keeps jumping quite a bit.Anyhow, Warcraft really isn't even half as bad some sources have touted it as. It's relatively easy to follow for even a person like me, who played the original RTS game years ago and has only skimmed WOW briefly before getting bored with it. At times it did feel like it expected me to be more familiar with the franchise than I am, but in all it still is fun.",7,7,13,13 June 2016
Donnie Darko," A movie for a generation
","I think Donnie Darko is one of those generation movies. That is, it's a movie I would have loved had I seen it when I was 21 when the movie was originally released. I think then I would have given it either a 10 or 9, as I might be just among the generation it tries to speak to.But I didn't see it when I was 21. I saw it when I was 34, 14 years after it was released, and the issues it handles, the social alienation, difficulty of human relations and adults who don't understand, don't feel as close to me as they did to me when I was closer to the years I had gotten out from the school.DD is not a bad movie by any means. It is a bit gimmicky with its time travel plot, but it is an intriguing tale of a young man with psychological issues, trying to make sense of the world around him. The script is good and the actors all do great work. At the baseline, there's nothing really wrong with the movie, I just think I saw it the wrong time to fully appreciate it.",7,0,3,14 June 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Hard to get better adventure than this
","More humor, more action, great plot and stunning locations, what else can anyone ask from Indiana Jones (Harrsion Ford) film?A flashback in the beginning tells us how Indiana became the Indiana we know and love, then we are ported back to present, or in late 30's to be exact. After tying in the plot we saw in the beginning we are to learn, that Indy's father (Sean Connery) has gone missing while trying to locate the holy Grail, trade mark. So off to hunt daddy and the grail we go, through Venice to Austria to the empire of Hatay.At first let me say, that the chemistry between Connery and Ford is incredible. They play extremely well together and every joke comes out funny. Without this the film could have been rather tedious, but luckily there is no reason to find out. From other familiar characters we see Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Salla (John Rhys-Davies). The Indy babe of the film is Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody).What else is there to say, a wonderful action adventure for those who can enjoy this kind of thing. I almost dare to say the best of the trilogy (or maybe it soon will be quadrilogy, if the fourth is ever made.) This is hard film to make better.Music is as good as John Williams can do, there is no surprise there. Spielberg directs with steady hand, balancing between adventure and calm bits with masterful hand, without over longing any scene more than necessary. I give my thumbs up for this film, go watch it already.",9,0,0,3 January 2006
Back to the Future," Fun and well made
","Sparing use of the special effects of its time, good script, good director and brilliant actors. That's the recipe in baking a classic comedy.Back To The Future is made in 1985, and surprisingly that doesn't show. If the special affects would have been overused the situation might be different, but now the effects enhance the plot nicely.Marty (Micheal J. Fox) is a teenager who is involved in a experiment of time travel with his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Suddenly Marty finds himself in the past and he soon is tangled in a relationship web of his dad and mom before they started to date. He must get the together or he and his siblings cease to exist in the future.All characters are nicely over the top and visual and verbal comedy is arranged so that there is always something funny afoot. There are very few serious situations in the film, but the plot isn't a bloated mess like it sometimes is in comedies. the plot is given enough space to breathe and present itself in a good manner, so that the in all red line isn't lost in the wilderness.When I was younger I always liked the part 2 better than this, but now after seeing this again after couple of years I can say, that Back To the Future is hilarious film.My thumbs up.",8,0,1,5 February 2006
Princess Mononoke," Perhaps one of the most captivating Japanese animations
","'Mononoke-hime' or 'Princess Mononoke', as the translated title goes, tells the old fable of how men cannot live in harmony with their surroundings. Instead of trying to adjust themselves to their surroundings they selfishly try to adjust the surroundings to their needs, in this case the people of Iron Town try to defeat the Forest Spirit, the guardian of the great forest, who is standing in their way in mining out precious iron from the depths of the earth.Prince Ashitaka defeats a wild boar demon near his home village, but in doing so he's injured and the wound casts a cures upon him that will devour him in the end. Thus he is banished from his people and he begins to seek the great Forest Spirit in order to get cured. On his journeys he befriends whit the people of Iron Town and he sets up on another mission as well: to try to get the people and the forest to live together in harmony.The animation and music is just wonderful. The scenery and characters work perfectly and the tempo of the film is almost perfectly balanced between calm moments and action. I haven't seen the original with Japanese voice actors, but I quite liked the English voice cast. At least they sounded like they were interested in doing their jobs and they did it quite nicely.'Princess Mononoke' is a rare gem of animation, aimed towards a bit more mature audience than your average Dinsey films, that while keeps you thrilled whit the beautiful writing and well fleshed out characters, it also gives you something to think about. It can be seen as a statement of how industrialization is good for people in the short term, but how it will eventually turn the surroundings around us, thus destroying the legacy of later generations to come.While many other animations will wither in time, I'm sure that 'Princess Mononoke' will be remembered as one of the classics of animation throughout the time.",10,2,3,8 September 2006
The Simpsons Movie," It could have worked better as a two parter TV episode.
","A movie about the yellow Simpsons family was in the making for a while. There was rumors about it from the late 90's and finally it did see the light in 2007. So, how did it turn out? Even though this is called 'The Simpsons Movie'it actually could have worked better as a two separate episodes in the show instead, as in the state it is now presented it has far too much empty spaces in it just to drag it in the feature movie length.There actually is very little difference in the story structure of the movie and the most resent 'The Simpsons' episodes, as the structure usually has Homer doing something stupid, the family resenting his actions and the deus ex something, which saves the day in some extent.I'm not slamming the movie though, it's not a bad film, as I did laugh and chuckle, but in the end it just doesn't work that well as a movie. But because it did made a mint of money, there's no doubt, that there wouldn't be an another attempt in the future, so here's for hoping they do a better job with it.",6,1,1,25 December 2007
The Martian," A tale of survivalist
","I have an idea of why the Martian has been so successful at the box office. It's not because it's a remarkable movie, but because of the times we live in. See, the Martian is a success story. It's a story about a man who is placed against insurmountable challenges, which he beats. It's a story of how other people are doing their best to safe the man in trouble as well, going as far as showing how other nations, which might normally have cold relations, are willing to help each other in order to safe one of us in need. Simply put, the Martian makes it easier to feel good about humanity and the state of the world, while in the real life we life in a world where we are not threatened only by political unrest, but terrorism and continuously freezing relations of modern superpowers. What I want to say is, that the Martian stands out for its own benefit from among the movies that try to be more grim and bleak.So let's tackle the basics. The Martian tells a story of how an astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left stranded on Mars after a hasty evacuation the Mars team has to make due to a storm. Believing that Mark is dead the rest of the crew blasts off, only for Mark to wake up to find that he's now the only human in Mars, with very limited means of making a contact back to NASA or his crew mates. But with some scientific ingenuity he doesn't only manage to solve his food problems, but also establish a new contact to Earth. The Martian is not a complex story. It's a kind of a take on Robinson Crusoe, but with people knowing where they can contact him, while planning his rescue.As the Martian is directed by Ridley Scott, it's also technically well made. The plot, while simple, works well under the steady direction of Scott and as usual his style looks very nice and the actors perform well. So all around it's just as steady of a movie you'd expect a director of Scott's caliber to do.So that's the Martian. It's a feel good movie and that's pretty much it. It's probably not a contender in the category of future classics, but it is a nice movie none the less.",7,3,7,22 October 2015
V for Vendetta," Good, yet simplified, political action drama.
","Let's put the good news here in up front: 'V for Vendetta' is the best movie made from Alan Moore's graphical novels. Though that wasn't hard task in such, as 'From Hell', even though had some pretty scenes, was a grave disappointment and 'The League Of Extraordinay Gentlemen' was just terrible.'V For Vendetta', directed by James McTigue and written by the Wachowski brothers of the Matrix fame is a dumbed down and heavily trimmed version of the graphical novel of same name. Roughly put, almost half of the characters have been eliminated and even the main characters have been some what altered. In example Evey (Natalie Portman) was an under aged prostitute, or at least a wannabe as she actually never got that far, and V (Hugo Weaving) himself was more of a cold hearted psychotic lover of anarchy. In the film he's a bit more likable in his insanity.The plot is nearly same with the novel, but as said trimmed down. Several side plots have been entirely eliminated because of reduced character count. Some things have been added in, like the budding romance between V and Evey. The importance of police captain Finch (Stephen Rhea) has been increased, but some of the most interesting aspects of his story, like the real reason of his understatement of V, have been cut out. Also the story of V is told so, that some viewers might get the idea, that V gained some kind of pyrotechnic powers from Larkhill. This wasn't the case. No superpowers in this film, unless you count V's speed and stamina.It's very easy to see who against some of the political messages are aimed in the film, that's why it's interesting to see how well this movie will last the test of time, as it is rather on the nerve of political on goings. 'V for Vendetta' isn't a bad movie, far from it, it's just too simplified from its origins in the form that it's presented. Also note, that it's not an action film, though it has some pretty neat action- and special-effects scenes in it.Acting is all together very good and effects and the whole totalitarian society of England is very nicely portrayed. John Hurt as Sutler, the great dictator, is doing very good job as a man, who has eyes everywhere. The film flows easily and I was entertained for the duration of the movie. It was much better than I expect it to be, but I fully understand why Moore thought, that script wasn't very strong.",7,0,1,24 April 2006
The Island," Starts good but turns into typical action flick
","Imagine, that you are living in a closed society, where all your needs are tented. You are healthy, you have friends and a job. But you can't go outside, because the people in charge tell you, that the outside world is contaminated and you would die, if you go there. There is one hope though: to win a lottery, that allows you to go in the last clean place in the world: the island.I've read from many places, that The Island is Michael Bays best movie. But in a sense, it's his biggest wasted opportunity to do a movie, that is not just action, but a meaningful, insightful essay of what humans really are. The beginning is really good and the cast is fantastic. But then, after the action starts to kick in Bay shows, that yes, he still is the same man, who finds the only glass table from the room for shot man to fall on.A movie manned with talented actors like Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean could have been so much more. But now it's nothing more than your typical, mindless action yarn, with an ending so sugar coated, that you can feel your teeth rotting in your mouth.",5,0,0,11 May 2009
The Godfather," Not the masterpiece people claim it to be.
","So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is 'Apocalypse, Now'. That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.",7,8,18,10 February 2006
