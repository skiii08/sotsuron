Requiem for a Dream," I became a part of the story. Of the horrifying story.
","First of all, this movie would never have worked without the acting. It was superb, with one actor/actress being the obvious best. You'll know which one when you watch the film.As for the experience this film provides, it is something raw, something cruel, something so inhuman that you know it must be real. I felt sick, I felt drugged out, I felt as if my life was falling apart and my head was about to explode. There is nothing calm or gratifying about this film, nor should there be. This is precisely what a movie about drugs should be like. Every scene - perfect.Watch it. Young, old, a lover or a hater of drugs, male or female. Watch it.See this film.Realize its truths.Live it.",10,1,2,20 October 2010
The Hangover," My Favorite Comedy...And I'm A Comedy Buff!
","I am not a frequent commenter. Whenever I comment on a film, it means I have fallen in love with it. It is exactly this situation that I now find myself in - I am in love with this brilliant comedy! There is not a single dull moment in this film. There isn't a single scene that bores you, so even when serious sentences are muttered, you can be certain that a glorious joke is soon to come. The characters are beautifully unique and perfectly created...they each have their own personality, therefore they all have different humor, and that is what makes a great, great, GREAT comedy.And the ending is...well...LEGENDARY.Go see this film, even if you're broke and will not have money left for a diminutive piece of bread! Trust me on this.",10,3,6,12 June 2009
Man on the Moon," A genius portraying a genius!
","What struck me about this film was the fact that even though I had not a clue as to who Andy Kaufman was prior to watching this film, I felt as if I had been hearing of him for the past twenty years after seeing it. This film told me about him very, very much and in a very, very realistic, non movie-like way...it did not dramatize every other minute and I felt as if I was actually watching his life story, not a fictional drama or comedy.Also, I was glad to see that this film did not attempt to explain, nor attempt to find a cause in Andy's way of performing, his way of LIFE. In the end, the audience is left with the same thought with which they began watching this film: 'Why was Andy Kaufman so strange?' Nonetheless, you do not find yourself disappointed once the ending arrives. What you are left with are joyous thoughts, intense thoughts...which is exactly what Andy would wish you to have.And Jim Carrey - WOW. Many have said this and I agree with all my heart; Jim Carrey became Andy Kaufman for this role. When I got on the internet and watched a few videos of Andy, scenes which were featured in the film, but acted out by Jim, the resemblance was, at times, even frightening. Jim Carrey, the man who uses his typical facial movements in many films, was something absolutely different in this film. Of course, his ability to change his countenance was imperative, but in a completely new way.If you are not looking for extreme Hollywood entertainment, but a wonderful film, this will make you smile.",10,0,0,5 January 2009
Revolutionary Road," Frighteningly real
","Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the incentive of my going to see this film, and I could not be more convinced of their talent than I am after the two-hour brilliance. This film is reality in its purest, yet magnificently artistic form Â– the anger that is portrayed repetitively and in various occasions reminded me of the wrath I myself occasionally experience, from the overture of an argument to its climax; the screaming, the furious need to verbally and physically harm, punch, kick, no matter how much affection is felt towards the recipient. Even during the scenes that are meant to be tranquil, there is anxiety and tension hidden in their smiles, a sort of counterfeit politeness that should never be present in a happy relationship. It is all a depiction of two genuine lives that have the potential of existing in complete harmony, yet cannot because of the stereotypical environment and situation they find themselves in. They both crave change, an alteration in their monotonous state of being, but because of the lengthy period of time that they have spent in such a circumstance, their mentality is differently modified. April (Kate Winslet) finds unreserved determination to leave to Paris and although her character seems at times erratic, we gradually come to understand that she is in fact the stronger personality of the two; she truly finds change favorable, whereas Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) seems to find the idea of change more flattering than change itself.Each choice a person makes can change a life, and that life is not always theirs. This film shows us just how wrong something right can be, as well as how right something wrong can be.",10,237,312,6 February 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Perfection for the Profound Soul.
","This film can either be understood and loved, or it can be utterly misunderstood and disliked. I am a person who enjoys all the great works of literature, who thinks deeply over the many joys and sorrows of life, and who sheds tears in almost all situations because, although I am sensible, I am also emotional and find no fault in expressing what I feel. When watching this film, everything depends on how you think of life and what you believe is of greatest value. To explain what I mean, allow me to give you an example: my father is a computer engineer and his reaction to this film was, 'I don't think he would have continued playing the game once he reached 10 million if he wasn't certain of the answer.' To those who value material things more than the love and devotion of one person for another, even if they do not fully realize it or do not wish to admit it to themselves, this kind of a reaction is bound to spring up. However, those who are entirely cognizant, completely aware of the significance of love will reply, 'He did it because he loved her.' And yet, the cynics will not understand. This film is a roller coaster without a single pause. Not one second of it bores you, not one second will you be able to say, 'I know what's gonna happen now.' Certain emotions ascend, only to be overcome by different and even stronger emotions; this cycle goes on from beginning to end and as credits begin rolling, you will either label this film as pessimistic, or as fantastically optimistic.For those with personality traits similar to mine, for those with a mind of feeling and sentiment stronger than anything else, for those who have the ability to search for the meaning of things, no matter how bizarre the exterior, this film will be remembered for a very long time as the most beautifully written, breathtakingly optimistic masterpiece of the past years.",10,2,5,7 March 2009
