Your Name.," Brilliant, just brilliant
","I usually don't watch or even like Japanese animation and the fact that this was a romantic movie didn't help. i only watched this movie because I was board but what I didn't know that I'll be watching the best romantic movie yet.if you think that this will be another cheesy Hollywood movie then you're in for a surprise.the way the story evolved will keep breaking your heart and putting it back together.I'll just say this, if you're a person who looks for a good story then watch this movie, you'll find what you're looking for.and take it from one who rarely gives a 10-star rating.",10,3,6,4 February 2017
