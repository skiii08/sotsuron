Requiem for a Dream," AKA Godfrey Reggio's THE LOST WEEKEND
","Anyone who considers this a disturbing movie must have been spoonfed the works of Touchstone Studios since day one. Never once did I forget these were professional actors doing a role, nor did I appreciate the frequent indie film star cameo. I have always felt that in order for an addiction movie to work, it must be gritty and starless. The plush 35mm colors featured here combined with the MTV-style skipping, looping, cut cut cut scenarios justifiably make this the first coffee table movie about junkies. I dare think that if Tobe Hooper, fresh from THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (you know, back when he had talent) had shot this story on grimy, grimy 16mm we would have achieved a truly lurid and disturbing portrait of junkiedom, instead of the pretentious gloss that is REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.",6,0,1,3 July 2001
American Psycho," The Golden Age of Cinema
","This 'movie' has all the subtlety of a kick to groin with golf shoes. Acting: horrible, direction: nonexistent, writing: embarrassing. I only assume the rating this wretched thing received on this board was so high was because the prols thought this was an art film, instead of the big-budgeted pseudo-European experimental garbage it really is.",3,1,5,4 November 2000
