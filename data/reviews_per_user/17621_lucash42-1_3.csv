The Blair Witch Project," Groundbreaking...in a sense
","I was 16 when the Blair Witch Project came out on the big screen. At this time, it was the talk of the over-populated high school I attended. So one Friday night, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to see it, she tentatively agreed. Once in our seats, many people around us were laughing and joking about the story, and what to expect.A man came in from the side door, and put both of his arms in the air in an attempt to quiet the young audience. He was an employee of the cinema and he began to speak with an incredible tone of seriousness.'Everyone please keep all of you're talking to a minimum, and please silence your pagers(cell phones weren't owned by many at this point). He said. 'This is a true story of these three young adults, and of how they lost their lives in a very tragic way.' With that, he exited.The hecklers were reduced to a minority, and it seemed as if no one spoke for quite some time. There was an uneasiness in the air that both myself and my girlfriend felt. Suddenly she leaned over and whispered in my ear.'Come on let's go see something else...' Before she could even finish her sentence, the lights died down, and the story began. We sat, glued to our seats, as it unfolded in such a way that you could barely tear your eyes away, and if you did, you were fearful that you would miss something vital.At this point, I was totally convinced that what I was witnessing was real. There was no room in my mind for doubt or logic, and the employee that spoke up in the beginning took care of that.The Blair Witch Project concluded, and I could never be more content with a movie after the first viewing. Normally I would focus on flaws, continuity, and the ever so popular question, 'Why didn't they just...' At 16 years old, I had found the first movie that scared the hell out of me. A decade later, it still makes me uneasy.",9,2,4,11 December 2008
Unbreakable," Incredible movie
","Director/Writer/Producer M. Night Shamalyn gets such a bad time for his movies. People call them boring, slow, and uninteresting, when really nothing could be further from the truth. What he has going against him, is the fact that we live in a society that must have a constant rush of blood, guts and gore to keep anyone's attention. If the movie being viewed does not provide this, the viewer will dub the movie 'stupid', and tell his other idiot friends not to give it a chance. Yes, Unbreakable is slow, it is long, and it is drawn-out. However, if you actually WATCH (wow, what a concept) this movie and take your ritalin so you can concentrate on what is happening on screen, you will be completely amazed at the talent at work.The acting is fantastic. The storyline brilliant. The message something of great merit and value.Congratulations to M. Night Shamalyn for another masterpiece. Too bad the average viewer would rather watch a 'awesome' movie, one where a total of 25 people die in the first ten minutes by a guy with a chainsaw.",10,1,1,16 February 2007
Signs," One of the most inspirational movies of our time
","I happened to be in a video store the other day, and was in line behind a couple of girls who were discussing scary movies. The movie 'Signs' was mentioned, and they both chimed up about the fact that the movie did not scare them, and was a terrible horror movie. If they were to have watched it with more of an open mind, however, they would realize that the movie did not have the intention to scare viewers. As with all of M. Night's movies, they strive to draw you in, and once he has your full attention, show you something that will make you stop and realize that what you are watching is not just another movie.M. Night Shamalyn succeeds on so many levels.The movie is not about an alien invasion...it is about a family's love for one another, and the fact that those who maintain blind faith in God will shine brighter than others.Everything happens for a reason. Whether it is Graham's wife dying, Merrill holding the strikeout record, Bo's obsession for clean water, or Morgan's asthma. It will all tie in at the end and show you something so beautiful that will make you think and wonder for many days after the end credits.I give this movie a 10...simply because it is one of the best displays of talent I have ever witnessed, and only hope that M.Night Shamalyn continues to make masterpieces.",10,1,3,9 November 2006
