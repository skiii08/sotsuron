United 93," It helps prove that it was inside job
",Clearly you can tell from the movie it's impossible. Fast and furious 7 was more likely. This whole story is bull and there's more to it. The movie really wasn't a movie more of a fake documentary.,5,2,11,7 April 2020
The Irishman," Good but not goodfellas good
","It's definitely Atleast an 8 or 9. Top notch writing and acting, it is 2019 and almost everything today has no flavour, no depth, most of all a lot of unrealistic stuff. It's no surprise people don't like this movie due to its 3.5 hours which is stupid because tv seasons are over 10 hours long and nobody told them they needed to watch it all in one sitting. I could see this movie not being appreciated as much in the theatres because you can't pause, and finish later if need be. Even if you didn't grow up watching joe Pesci and deniro, even if you didn't grow up watching al Pacino you'd have to be a complete oblivious person to not appreciate the talent. Nobody with purple hair, no trans people, no girls that rule the world so of course people of this generation hate the movie but they are the last people we should listen to. Highly recommend this piece of art and to top it off it's even a true story which makes it a piece of history. TOP NOTCH",9,2,5,11 December 2019
Horrible Bosses," Bateman holds the movie
","Pretty descent comedy, I have grown to be annoyed by Charlie days voice. Which is sad because I think he would be funny otherwise. Some good comedy a little silly but that's the idea of these movies to take them lightly",7,3,5,22 February 2019
Kick-Ass," A real superhero
","I don't care. If you don't enjoy this movie, You have no heart and no love for good cinema. This movie represents everything people think of when we want to imagine a 'real superhero'. If you don't relate to this film, you probably aren't a good person. It's that real and that good. Amazingly acted, very VERY original. AND gave birth to two AMAZING stars. Chloe grace moretz and Aaron Taylor Johnson. Add that to Nicholas cages top 5 roles. Makes for one of the best movies In history of cinema.",10,0,0,14 April 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," One of the best in the franchise
",Amazing movie. Awesome action and honestly I have always loved Justin long as an actor. He's funny but yet very good and you can never tell he's even acting he convinces you that you're watching real life action. Bruce is amazing In this one. Definitely one of the best in the franchise,9,0,0,5 July 2020
The Hangover Part III," Hilarious
","Not as good as the first but it's hilarious. Really good, if you like the first 2 you'll love this one.",9,1,2,17 April 2020
