Antz," So good it's bad?
","Have you have ever heard of the saying 'So bad it's good'? If you don't understand what that means, I'll explain. The 'So bad' part means that the movie is probably badly ated, probably because it is a bad movie. The 'So good' part means that it is entertaining. However, I feel the exact opposite for this movie.I was just so bored in the beginning 30 minutes of the movie! I don't get how this got a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes.",1,1,5,5 May 2018
Inside Out," Ok it's not Pixar's best, but still a good movie
","Inside Out is one of my personal favorite movies. Reasons why?1. It's funny 
2. Great animation
3. The plot is understandable 
4. Great actorsSure, movies like Toy Story 1 and 3, Coco, and Finding Nemo were better, but this is still an absolute must-watch you should see.10/10",10,1,4,17 June 2018
Shrek the Third," Out of all Shrek movies, this one is the only one I didn't like
","Really? Shrek as a king? Dumbest idea I've ever heard. Alot of lame jokes, boring plot, and horrible acting. Just watch the other 3. I was going to give this a 1/10, but I'll give this another star for animationScore: 2/10",2,3,4,25 June 2018
Back to the Future Part II," My least favorite of the series, but still a must-see.
","I'm a big fan of the original BTTF. The second one was good. The third one was almost great. My problem with the second and third BBTF is the acting. The charecters are kinda boring but everyting else was great!I still suggest you see all BTTF, but don't watch the third f you haven't watched this one.",8,1,3,3 June 2018
Black Panther," I liked it. (A review from someone that isn't a fan of Marvel)
","Yup. You heard me. I'm not a Marvel Fan. I don't watch movies about superheroes. This is the first Marvel movie I've seen since Green Lantern. And I personally was entertained. Especially the scene with that car scene. However, I would had given this a 10/10, but the accents are just plain bad.If you're a Marvel fan, you'll probably be dissapointed in this one. If you aren't a Marvel fan, I recommend you go see it.",8,1,2,6 June 2018
Back to the Future," Amazing Movie! *SO MANY SPOILERS*
","This is my favorite movie of all time! It has a great plot, great comedy, and epic Sci_Fiction. 10/10  The movie starts off with Marty McFly going to Doc's house and eventually gets to school late with this girlfriend Jennifer Parker. Next, we met Mr.Strickland(The Principal) who gives both Marty and Jennifer a late pass and then insults Marty that he will never make it in the Music Tryouts(Marty doesn't make it though) . Marty then say 'Well the futue is gonna change'. What I mean is that Marty loves to play the guitair. After the tryouts, Jennifer and Marty start walking through Hill Valley and notice a 4x4 Toyota car that Marty dreams of getting. Then, Marty tells Jennifer about what he plans to do with that car when he gets it from his parents. Right when Marty and Jennifer about to kiss, a woman interupts them saying that Mayor is saying up money to replace a clock that was struck by lighting(you'll see how when Doc trys to get Marty back to 1985). When Jennifer's dad comes to pick her up, she writes her phone number on the piece of paper that the woman gave Marty and then kisses him. When Marty gets back home riding his skateboard, we met Marty's Father (George McFly) and Biff Tannen(George's bully and supervisor). They both met because a car crashed and George has to pay to fix the car. The car Marty wanted can't be bought now because of the crashed car. Next, we met the rest of the Family Lorraine McFly (Marty's mother), Dave McFly(Marty's brother) and Linda McFly(Marty's sister). At 12:28 am, Doc calls Marty to met him at Twin Pines Mall to show him something. That something was his Delorian that is now a Time-Machine. At around 1:30am a van with 2 men come up at the Mall and shoot Doc. Marty jumps into the Time-Machine and traveled to the year 1955. When Marty arrives to Hill Valley, he realises that he traveled to 1955 and decided to find Doc and ask him to help him get back to the year 1985. Before all this, Marty comes upon a Cafe that has a Phone and a phonebook. In the cafe, we met Marty's father at a younger age and Biff at a younger age also. We learn that George is a wimp and Biff is a bully with another bunch of dudes. When George leaves the Cafe, Marty follows him and then he spots George on a tree branch looking through binoculars at Lorraine(the young one. About George's age). George then falls from the tree.(This is how George and Lorraine got married in the first place) then Marty pushes George out of the way of a moving car and the the ca hits Marty. Marty is then taken into Lorraine's house and mets her and her family. Marty then leaves the house to go find Doc. After Marty finds Doc, Marty shows Doc the car that he invented. Suddently, Marty shows a picture of him and his siblings. One of their heads are missing, this means that they are getting erased from existance because the young Lorraine is in love with Marty instead of George. The next day, Marty introduces George to Lorraine and she ignores him. At lunch, Marty asks George why he doesn't want to ask Lorraine out. George says that she already wants to go out with someone like Biff. At night, Marty wakes up George with Van Halen music saying that he is Darth Vadar saying that if he doesn't ask Lorraine out to the dance, he will remove his brain cells. The next day, George mets Marty at the Cafe asking for help to ask Lorraine out because he doesn't know how to. Right when George asks out Lorraine, Biff and his crew comes up and demands for his money for entering the Cafe. Marty then trips Biff and then punches him and runs away. As Marty runs, he comes upon two kids riding some scooter thing. Marty breaks one of their scooter things and then rides it as a skateboard. As Biff and his crew try to ram Marty into a truck full of Cow Poop with his car, Marty climbs right over his car and lands back on his skateboard. Biff's car then crashes to the truck and next thing you know, they are covered in cow poop. Later, Marty stops over at Doc's house and they plan how to send Marty back in time. Lorraine then comes and asks Marty to the dance. Marty says yes. Later, Marty teaches George how to get Lorraine and take her to the dance. On the night of the dance, while Doc sets up everything to get Marty back to 1985, Marty drives Lorraine to the dance. Before the dance, Marty writes Doc a letter saying when he goes back in time, he gets shot. A few minutes after Marty parked, Biff and his friends lock Marty in a car truck for $300 damage to Biff's car after he crashed the car into the truck of Cow Poop while Lorraine was stuck with Biff in the car. At exactly 9:00 pm, George comes to the car and took Marty's advice to getting Lorraine and punched Biff in the face whice eventually knocked him out. After Marty gets freed from the car trunk by the band that played music for the dance, he saw that George and Lorraine were together. But Marty and his family were still getting erased from existance. At the dance, George kisses Lorraine and marty's existance wasn't in danger anymore and George was becoming ppular at school. After Marty's guitair solo of 'Johhny Be Good' by Chuck Berry, Lorraine and George met Marty at the exit door and says that he must be going. Next, Marty mets Doc at the front of the clock tower and Doc gives Marty instructions of what he has to do to get back in time. Doc realizes that Marty gave him a letter about the future and tears it apart. As Doc tears apart the letter, a power line for their plan falls off the clock tower. Doc tell Marty to go towards the end of the stree and wait for the clock that he gave Marty to ring. After the clock rings, the Delorian somehow goes dead. Marty hits his head against the steering wheel and it turns back on. As Marty starts his long drive back to the clock tower, Doc accidently detaches another power line of their plan as he attaches the other part that fell first. Next, Doc swings on the power line and as soon as the ligntning struck, Marty came and Doc connected the power line and Marty has made it to 1985. After Marty gets back to 1985, the Delorian goes dead again and wouldn't turn on again. After the Delorian goes dead, the van with the 2 men are driving to the mall to shoot Doc. Marty starts to run to the mall to keep Doc from getting killed. We see Doc get shot again and ther old Marty travel to 1955. After the van crashes into a mini building, Marty checks on Doc. Doc is alive because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Marty asks Doc how he knew he was gonna get shot and he shows Marty the torn up letter he gave him. Doc drives Marty back home and says that he going into the future 30 years. The next morning, we met Marty's family and Biff, and they all look different! Biff doesn't mess with George anymore and Dave wears a suit to the office now. Marty's mother said that he got the car he wanted. After Marty sees his car, Jennifer shows up and asks him 'How about a ride mister?'. After they were about to kiss again, Doc comes back to 1985 and tells Marty that something has got to be done about his kids. Marty tells Doc that he doesn't have enough road to get up to 88mph. Then, Doc says, 'Where we're goin' we don't need roads'. The car starts to fly in the air and flys into the screen. The end!Oh boy! This took me a very long time to type, but it's worth hearing about the movie again! 10/10",10,1,1,30 March 2018
