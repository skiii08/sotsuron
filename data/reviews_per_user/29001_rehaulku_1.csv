Marie Antoinette," Yankee Idiots
","First 25 minutes. Nothing happens.Can she speak French before coming to France? We don't know.What kind of personality does she have? We don't know.Film says nothing about the history. Film says nothing about reality.French people have Yankee mimics and dialect. What kind of comedy is this? Film is English. Why? Novel is about France, not USA.Terrible Kirsten. Awful acting.This is a real 'kitsch' film.How did they give the prizes? God knows.How did they take the prizes? This is absurd.These are real Yankee idiots.",1,7,10,1 December 2007
