Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn was robbed
","I finally saw this movie on Sundance and I was mesmerized.  There must be a million movies out there about drug addictions but this one just grabbed and pulled you into the world of these four people as they struggle with their addictions.  The 3 twenty-somethings - Jared Leto, Jennifer Connolly and Marlon Wayans all struggle with their addiction to Herion.  However, the most incredible role was Ellen Burstyn, the mother of Jared Leto and suffering through her own addiction to diet pills (speed).
Up until this point I though Julia Roberts did a good job with Erin Brockovict and winning the Oscar.  But I realize now that the best actress award should have went to Ellen Burstyn from 'Requiem of a Dream'.  Maybe the Academy felt that they had to give to a mainstream actress after indie actress Hillary Swank won last year, but I think that Ellen was robbed. She was incredible.",10,0,1,29 October 2001
Unbreakable," Yikes, I actually sat through this stinker
","This movie was just a horrible movie and I found absolutely no redeeming qualities in it whatsoever.  The only reason I sat through the entire movie was to find out what the 'big deal' was at the end of the movie.  And it just wasn't worth it.The director tried to hard to recapture the magic that he and Willis created with 'The Sixth Sense' and tried just too dang hard.  There was too much Hitchcock/Welles type camera tricks that just got old way too quickly.  And throughout the whole movie the cast spoke so slow and sullenly that I found myself dozing off throughout the movie.And the kid in the movie, well, he wasn't any Haley Joel Osment.  I'm really hoping that M. Night S's next movie will be a big improvement.  I'd recommend if you really need to see this movie to wait for the video to come out.  That way you can pause throughout the movie and take a nap.",2,0,1,2 December 2000
Pitch Black," An interesting sci-fi movie
","While browsing my video store, I picked up a copy of Pitch Black.  I heard of 1 or 2 folks who had seen it and made a decent comment on it.  After watching it (for the 3rd time now) I would definately recommend this movie to anyone else.  I've seen better movies about 'evil in outerspace' but I've also seen alot worse too.  This movie had a decent plot and an excellent cast.  Not only did they have the nocturnal aliens to fight with, but there were excellent conflicts created within the group of humans trying to get off this planet.  I especially like the conflict built up between Johns and Riddick.  Vin Diesel was an excellent choice for the role of Riddick.If you're looking for a good sci-fi movie, definately pick this one up; although, not for the kids.  There is much gore in this movie that may be very scary for younger childern.",8,0,0,22 October 2000
Life Is Beautiful," I fell in Love
","What is it about these quirky Italian movies?  I first fell in love with Il Postino, but the movie surpassed every expectation I had.  I could not believe how I was anywhere from laughing to crying to both.  Bengingi's acting was incredible and yes, he did have the comedic timing of Charlie Chaplin.  Take the time to see this movie.  Then go rent Il Postino and watch it too. Makes me want to take off for Italy for a month.",10,1,2,21 February 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," What a disappointment
","What a disappointment!!  Anyone who rated this movie higher than a 5 probably did so cause they liked all the nudity.  But let me tell you, this movie was just down right horrible.  And I love Stanley Kubrick films! Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket are both in my top 20 of favorite films.  This is probably in the bottom 5 and I can't believe I sat through all 2 3/4 hours of this movie.  As I left the theatre, it turns out I was not the only one who felt extremely disappointment by this movie.  Everyone was complaining about this movie (for those who actually stuck out the entire film, there were several walk outs too).Where did the movie go wrong?  Well, first he cast Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as the couple.  Let's face it, Nicole and Tom are incredible actors on their own.  (Kidman - To Die For, Portrait of a Lady, Dead Calm and Cruise - Rain Main, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men just to name a few).  But the other 2 films that Cruise/Kidman starred together in (Days of Thunder and Far & Away) they just have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  This movie just proved it one more time.  If either of them is to ever win an Oscar, they should stop starring in movies together.  Second, personally I do think that Kidman is the better of the 2 actors and yet she was practically delegated to a supporting role.  She is a strong actress and deserves a much better role than what this movie had to offer her.  Did she have to be drunk during the dance scene?  All this talk of the sex between her and Cruise was nothing compared to her porn-star romp with the Navy officer.  Nicole, you deserve a much better part than what this movie offered.  Tell your husband you love him and go find a movie script and a co-star that will help earn you an Oscar.And Cruise, first, what's this with Doctor's flashing their badges everywhere they go?  He was just not believable as a doctor?  That whole badge thing was like 'Hey, I'm a doctor here's my badge, now can you do something to help me get this plot out of a rut?'Finally, just a few other things that bugged me.  Was it necessary that the prositute have to have HIV?  I realize that safe sex and HIV/AIDS awareness is an important topic, but it added nothing to this movie.  I was slightly offended at the 13 year-old prostitute, just felt it wasn't necessary and quite disturbing.  And yes, what's the big deal about having to block out the orgy scene?  I mean, we saw the sex, we saw total frontal nudity.  And let's face it, this movie should be NC-17 rated.  No parents in their right mind would let their kids go see this movie.  Then again, no parents in their right mind should go see this movie.This movie is a sad finale for Stanley Kubrick.  He's had a marvoulous film history with some of the most memorable, visual, thought-provoking movies of our time.  It's a shame this had to be his last hurrah.  If you've never seen any of Kubrick's other films, please rent them so you can appreciate the fact that he was a brililant director.Well, that's my say.  Oh, and get ride of that horrible music in the movie too.  That was the most treacherous sound to my ears.",1,2,6,25 July 1999
The Matrix," This is a great, must-see movie
","I'm not into techno gen-X movies, but more of the classical art house type movies.  But my friends all kept recommending to see this movie and I'm glad I listened.Take away all the killer special effects and fancy martial art scenes and what you get is a movie that still has a well written plot!  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.Go see this movie, it's definitely worth all the hype (oh and an added plus, I had the Star Wars preview too!)",8,0,0,17 April 1999
