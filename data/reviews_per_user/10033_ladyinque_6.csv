Men in Black 3," The Biggest Plothole in History... and none saw it
","Does anyone noticed the massive plothole here?!?!?Ok lets go back in time (no joke intended) to 1997 when the first movie came out and im gonna ask a simple question 'Who did Jay become a MIB?' Because KAY recruited him!!!!If anyone saw the first movie even Zed rejected the boy so only thanks to Kay insistance he was chosen as a MIB so, if Kay was killed in 1969, who did Jay become an MIB if Kay wasnt around?Anyone gets this? Jay was a MIB thanks to Kay but, without Kay, who is this possible? So the whole movie is pointless and stupid they try to make it a 'time-disturbance-lets-go-back-to-set-it-right' movie and they failed because they ignored the same rules they stablished from the beginning like 'No Kay no Arc Net so boglodites return and destroyed earth' that was fine but they ignore Jay's whole life... it was so simple so simple they could just changed Jay's life after Kay got killed in 69 and, in the present, he could still be a cop but then Griffin intercepted him and show him 'a different life' he was supossed to have (with Kay) and, when the boglodites attacked earth told him 'only you can save him and save us' kinda thing and ta-da! But no they ignore that small detail about Kay+MIB=Jay MIB so NO Kay+MIB=NO Jay MIB and they make a stupid movie with, i think, the biggest plothole in history!!!!!!!",5,1,8,9 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Not so good...
","Honestly? What happened to the 'dark' tone of the first two? This is nothing like a Thor movie should be and some people are right when they say that the jokes makes the movie a joke i mean there's not a single line i can take serious in this movie every single dialogue is destroyed by a final joke all they needed was the drum sound at the end of it please!!!
Realy a bad Thor movie a lot of characters were misplaced and unnecesary specially Loki what happened with THE Loki we saw in the other movies specially 'Avengers Loki' that backstabbing son of a gun with powers and all so wasted and Hulk please the storyline was unnecesary and stupid honestly the director should had place Loki in place of Hulk and make a 'Thor vs. Loki' gladiator match ya know and i like Hela but she was not enough to make this movie good so this is another movie that falls in the 'Curse of the Third' scenario just another saga that was ruined in the third act... shame",5,1,4,1 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Really? It THIS Spiderman?
","Seriously? What the heck happened with Andrew Garfield? The Amazing Spiderman are awsome movies ok i agree maybe part 2 was not very good but since when Hollywood jumps the shark and cancels a franchise if Amazing 2 was not good enough they should had done a part 3 and get back to the top not reboot it and make this crap!!
And yes first of all i hate Holland as Spiderman not at all and i have nothing against ethnicity and multi-racial things but since when Flash Thompson is indi?!?! Revolori as Thompson?!? Flash thompson should be 'a star high school football player who mercilessly bullies other students' and Zylka was perfect for it and please stop changing Peter's love interest!!! I agree that Gwen came first than MJ but please stop rebooting and honestly im starting to hate the crossovers what hapenned to SOLO movies? Iron-man mixed in the movie? Please i want a solo movie like superheroes used to have...Bottom line, to be honest, the fierst time i saw the movie i stop watching after 20 minutes then i decided to give it a second shot and i bare 132 minutes i wish i had spend them doing other stuff but ok... 5/10 for me and its not 'the best spiderman movie' its just another movie for KIDS if you want a Spiderman movie in my opinion watch Amazing Spiderman 1-2 with Garfield (and if you want Maguire ones too but i warned you about the third...)Bye-bye",5,2,3,21 January 2018
Justice League," The Big Disappointment of 2017...
","Ok lets start with the 'possitive' things... if there any:Overall the plot itself was good ya know the mother boxes blah blah blah and all that it was a good base but terribly executed Naw the bad:Overall... everything!I still cant see Ben Afleck as Batman its really terrible the worst batman ive ever see (even Clooney was better) now i understand why now there are troubles with 'The Batman' Afleck leeft the direction so now another guy has to take the 'director' title and also there are troubles with him again as Batman it seems Afleck does not want to play the bat anymore so if the studios dont solve that the movies gonna get cancelledNow continue the worst villain since Eisenberg's Luthor was Steppenwolf totally CGI boring no interesting at all and not even the post-credit scene with Deadstroke saved the movieThe Flash is a joke worst flash ever and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is still not convincing even when, overall, i liked Wonder Woman movie but gadot is not Wonder Woman i cant see her and Aquaman was funny, maybe, another 'good' stuff of the movieCavill does what Cavill does i agree on the mess of the CGI removing the mustache thing due to the fact hes filming M:I:6 at the same time so they he cant shave-the-mustache-off but also terrible Overall this movie was a mistake and yes they tried to make a 'Avengers rip-off' about a bunth of independant heroes that unite themselves against a common threat and they failed... honestly i dont know why they didnt used the 'Secret Origins' storyline from the animated tv show cause the mother boxes storyline was lost anyway so there was no connection with BvS at all (unless you watched the extended version) so no need to make the mother boxes story at all... so again big loss and this movie was supposed to be a movie to remember lieka big hit but ended up being just 'another forgettable' movie of 2017 in a few months none uis gonna remember it... not like the Avengers that is still a hit!5/10 cause i liked Aquaman and Cavil overall the rest is CGI garbage If they want to make a sequel i recommend fire all the idiots that made this trash, cancell The Batman spinoff, The Flash: Flashpoint spinoff & Cyborg spinoff and use THAT budget to make a decent sequel hiring GOOD staffSee ya",5,1,2,2 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Agree... why this has a good score when its so bad?
","After Episode VII i thought that the new trilogy was going to be awsome but Episode VIII was a huge let down the movie i think it honestly too long and boring the new characters are not likable (specially Rose) and others are forgetable like Holdo and Benicio's DJ (and dont understand how great actors like Laura Dern & Benicio said yes to this movie off course, if i think a symbol, $, i think i just answered my own question)
The movie, if you LOOK CLOSELY has some ripoffs from episodes V and VI like Rey arriving to a planet to be trained by Luke, she begins the training but then leaves half-way the training (the same happened to Luke in Episode V with Yoda in Dabobah) and then Rey surrenders herself to Kylo and is taken to meet Snoke and then she 'convinces' Kylo to turn against Snoke killing him the same happened in Episode VI (!!!) Luke surrenders to Vader and is taken to see Sidius then both turn against it and kills Sidius (come on!) and honestly at some opint i find myself looking at the clock asking 'How much til this ends?!?!'FINAL NOTE: Whats the new fashion Hollywood? They turn every single movie into a joke-after-joke movie please first they ruined Thor: Ragnarok and now Star Wars adding stupid jokes in the mix please what happened with 'serious' movies?!?!? What's nest? John Wick: Chapter 03? Avengers: Infintiy War? Stop with that!!

The Iron Giant," Awsome Movie for Kids and Adults alike sit, pop-corn, enjoy!
","The Iron Giant is a wonderfull movie trully wonderful with a message about 'be yourself' and 'you choose who you wanna be' etc. Really good movie witrh message for kids and some jokes like 'Supermaaaan' and sad in the end my little sister cried when the Giant sacrifices to save the town but in the very end, when the pieces of the Giant start moving towards the head in Iceland realizing its alive she stopped crying and smiled really a nice movie for all audiences sit, pop-corn and enjoy!",8,0,0,7 March 2018
