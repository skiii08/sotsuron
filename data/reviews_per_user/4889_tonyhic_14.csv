Marie Antoinette," Astoundingly Uneventful
","This comment can't contain any spoilers because there's nothing to spoil in the entire movie. What happens? An Austrian girl goes to France, gets married, has a couple of kids, dances, sleeps, wakes up, gets dressed, eats, drinks, giggles a bit.It seems that Coppola has deliberately gone out of her way to take something as fascinating and monumental as the French Revolution and make it as dull and insignificant as possible.On the plus side, the scenery and costumes were pretty. I also liked the music. Therefore, I'll allocate one star for the visual impact of the lovely frocks and palaces, and two stars for the quirky pop music. To that I'll add absolutely nothing for the plot. I'm not bloodthirsty, but in a film set during the revolution, I want to see at least a couple of angry peasants and a few of the nobility getting what they deserve. It was very disappointing.",3,0,0,31 October 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Not much to recommend
","If you've seen any disaster movie, I don't reckon you should bother forking out too much money to see this one. It doesn't offer much in the way of innovation.There are some great disaster scenes - a gang of tornados terrorising Los Angeles, helicopters freezing in mid air, monster hailstones in Tokyo and the signature tsunami hitting New York. All these are very entertaining, and enough to keep you watching.Which is very fortunate, because the rest of the plot has almost nothing of interest. You might bide your time between the action scenes by counting the disaster movie cliches in the storyline. There has to be at least a dozen.
Another way to make it more fun would be to repeat some of the lines of dialogue and try to make them sound realistic. It's probably imposssible, but it at least provides a mental challenge - something the director obviously tried to prevent at all costs.",7,0,0,29 May 2004
28 Weeks Later," Noisy AND Repulsive
","I saw this because I was impressed by 28 Days Later. It was thought-provoking and very disconcerting. 28 Weeks Later, however, pushes the boundaries way too far, to the point where it became revolting and extremely annoying.Firstly, it was much too loud. I suppose the makers were trying to involve us by giving us a sense of the chaos the characters were enduring, but I really could have done without the headache that was inflicted on me.The opening scene was bloody and violent, I was thankful when it was over, but my relief didn't last long. It seems every single scene in this movie was designed either to scare the daylights out of us or to revolt us with gore. After a while it got on my nerves and I longed for a bit of intelligent writing. There was a bit, but not enough to outweigh all the blood and guts and noise.",3,3,7,12 May 2007
The Village," Infantile
","Hard to believe the writer of this tosh also wrote 'The Sixth Sense.' That was a cleverly constructed plot with engaging characters.This one seems to have been written by a ten-year-old.You can't transgress the boundary, or 'those we do not speak of' will get you. The dialogue is excruciating. In the end, I was hoping the unspeakables would just raid the village and do away with its inhabitants merely because that would mean I wouldn't have to listen to their drivel anymore.Near me in the cinema, there were two people chatting constantly throughout the film . Normally I'd have a go at them for being so inconsiderate, but with this film I didn't feel it was justified. I'm sure their conversation was far more entertaining than the rubbish on the screen.",3,0,2,6 September 2004
Spider-Man," Utter Tosh
","Action scene, heartwarming dialogue, action scene, heartwarming dialogue,... Repeat this sequence until the end, finishing with a shot of the American flag, and millions will hail it as a great movie.As far as superhero movies go, this is worse than ALL the Batmans and ALL the Supermans. I can't imagine the plot being any more simplistic. Worst of all, it takes itself seriously. A painful experience.",3,0,0,8 June 2002
The Fast and the Furious," The Fast and the Fatuous
","I think I lasted about 40 minutes before I ejected the vid. Sexy men are not enough for a movie, and I wasn't that interested in the fast cars. What really annoyed me was that instead of using a plot, the script seemed to be a series of product placements.",2,1,3,8 March 2003
Spirited Away," Irritating Load of Tosh
",The best thing this drivel had going for it was the artwork. Some scenes were very pretty. Apart from that it was a disgustingly oversentimental attempt to outdisney Disney. the plot didn't make much sense and the characters were all somewhere in the range between mildly annoying and making me want to scream SHUT UP at the screen.,2,13,43,26 April 2003
Mamma Mia!," Don't take a ch-k-ch-chance on this one
","I'm a die-hard Abba fan from the mid-70s, so I loved the music. Always have. And the cast did a reasonable job of singing the songs. They don't hold a candle to Anna and Frida, but it would be wrong to expect them to. But I did expect the movie to add something to the music. It didn't. I came out of the cinema thinking I should have just stayed at home and listened to Abba Gold. My 3-star rating is for the music alone.The plot was worse than corny. It was lazy. Not even the slightest attempt to make a plausible link between SOS and Gimme Gimme Gimme. They could have played all the Abba film clips one after the other and the resultant plot would have been more coherent than this tosh.Finally, although I've always admired Julie Walters, I'd like to wring her bloody neck for her performance here. Shameless slapstick is all I can say. Extremely offensive, and the last resort of a brainless filmmaker.",3,2,4,9 August 2008
No Man's Land," Grim but Excellent Farce
","This is the way war movies should be made. No heroes, except perhaps the unfortunate Marchand, who risks death and his career to try to save the three fighters caught between Bosnian and Serbian front lines against overwhelming odds.No Man's Land shows the absurdity of war very skilfully. It is full of irony and pathos. What struck me was the fact that the warring parties communicated more effectively with each other than the UNPROFOR did with anyone.",8,2,6,29 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Delicious
","This is a treat to watch. Not much of a story, but that's of no consequence. The cast is superb. For Nicole and Ewan, this is better than they've ever done. The supporting cast also provide a lot of delightful moments. However, a few bits were just too smarmy , with not enough tongue in cheek. Although this just doesn't have as much grab as Romeo + Juliet or Strictly Ballroom, it's still highly enjoyable.",8,0,1,5 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," Well, it started off well.
","Oh, come on, David Bloody Lynch. It's not enough just to be quirky and enigmatic in your films. They have to make a little bit of sense to the audience. Just a little, OK? This one started off very confusingly and I was thinking that as time progressed the pieces would all fit together. That was a foolish thought, as it turned out. The pieces didn't so much fit together as disintegrate.So perhaps David was trying to tell me that I shouldn't make such assumptions, that things don't always fit together. Well congratulations, pal, you've made your point. Problem is, I already knew that. Everyone knows that. But when I watch a film, I want to be entertained. With this one I gave up after an hour and started reading a book.",1,22,43,13 September 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Vera and Virility
","Poor Brad and Angelina. They're so good-looking, it must be hard for them to get interesting roles in films. Then again, Brad did score Tyler Durden and the bloke in Snatch (Was he called Snatch?). So maybe Brad has no excuse for his involvement in this tosh.Yes, there are a few amusing moments. Annoyingly, the good lines all come from Brad. He gets to have fun, while Angelina Jolie acts dour and tough. They should have given her character ,and in fact the whole script, a bit of substance and humanity.Apart from these few moments, the film consists of a lot, an awful lot, of violence. He hits her. She shoots him. They knife a target. Someone bombs them both. It's all extremely entertaining if you you find that sort of stuff entertaining. I don't. Most of Arnie's action movies were cleverer than this.",4,1,3,14 June 2005
Munich," Kill, kill, kill, but not in a repetitive way
","They start killing people on a list that Golda Meir gave them. They kill the first person. Then they kill the second person using a different method. Then they killed the third person using yet another different method. However, they almost accidentally killed the target's child, who played the piano, so they have to delay the murder until the little pianist is out of harm's way, and then they kill their third target. Or maybe that's what happened with the second target. I lost track. Then they killed a larger number of people by shooting them, which was a different method again, although very similar to the first method, which was shooting. And the interesting thing is that they kill them all in different cities, except when they kill a lot of people at once, which they do in the same city, or when they go back to a city where they've already killed someone. And that's what happens in the first hour and a half, which is when I unfortunately stopped watching.",1,3,7,6 February 2010
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Weak and Witless
","On seeing the shorts to this film, I decided against it because it seemed very annoying, especially George Clooney's exaggerated facial expressions. However, a friend told, me that if I liked Fargo (which I loved), I'd also like this one. Since then, I've significantly reevaluated my judgment of this friend's taste. It was just as annoying as the shorts suggested. For quite a while, I was waiting for the story to turn around and improve, but it was a long, uninteresting story that finished too late. The characters were unlikeable and the jokes were painfully obvious. I've seen more sophisticated plots and humour in most Dukes of Hazard episodes.The only redeeming features were beautiful scenery and some nice music, but surely we have a right to expect a bit more of a movie than that.",3,5,12,20 February 2001
