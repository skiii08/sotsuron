10 Cloverfield Lane," The movie with the bizarre story
","in the beginning of the movie until the almost final scenes , you will watch a wittily-done mysterious movie plot because of of the surprisingly constant unexpected events , but the ending scene is something else , that's why i classify this movie to be a surreal one ,i like how 'Mary Elizabeth Winstead' done her role astonishingly good , and not to forget 'John Goodman' either , but what worth mentioning here is the last scene intervention , i swear it will draw your attention and make you wonder and reconsider the movie's main purpose , and in my opinion if it wasn't for the guy who put the soundtrack the movie would be turned to comedy . overall ,the movie worth your time and if you're into unexpected , suspenseful movie , and like to get real flabbergasted! then i recommend you to watch this movie . Thank you All..",8,0,0,26 January 2017
Hereditary," King Paimon in the house
","This is A Phenomenal suspenseful movie , very eerie, about apparitions and spiritual events took places at dr.Graham's house , guess it's hereditary because it all started from their grandmother or even before who knows! What make it interesting about this film is you won't be having all the answers even after you watched it , it's cool movie new style, don't miss it .",9,1,5,19 November 2018
Monster," Never underestimate the power of prostitutes .
","The thing is Aileen underestimated herself by just dreaming and not working for her goals she just waited for people to discover her for nothing , this story is really inspiring if you understand it . she didn't know that life is harsh and it will hit her so bad and like that guy said: when the beach party is over you don't get to say you know what ! now i'd like to have what everybody worked their entire life for , it doesn't work that way . so don't quit and never give up but you have to work hard for your dream by taking the right path otherwise you'll end up like Alieen , this movie is powerful and full of lessons , Charlize Theron performance was really fantastic might be her best movie .",9,1,1,22 April 2017
Passengers," Drama! override. romance! Reside.
","This is a marvelous sci-fi movie I noticed the character's names sound little fishy Mr. Preston and miss lane could've been Jim Boyed and Laura Shawn or something similar , Jennifer acting was outstanding ,but not as Chris's because on the last scene she seemed to overact the thrilling scenes, however ,she's the best at voiceovers scenes , synopsis of the movies loneliness is torturous can make you go crazy and make you harm others cause nobody want to ache alone and the second learned is not to dwell on things you can't control , instead focus on what you can control and use it to make you happy .
the main moral of the story is not to dismiss love and accept the fact that fate is the captain of your life not the other way around .",9,0,0,10 November 2018
Little Boy," don't belittle the little boy
","This movie killed two birds with one stone, it tackled racism against japanese during the second world war period, also it focused on matter of the metaphysical power of a might faith, most of the ending scenes were sentimental sobbing material in which render the movie to become melodramatic and fanciful , i enjoued it although i thought it was going to be tiresome but luckily it wasn't tacky .",8,1,1,21 January 2019
BlacKkKlansman," The blackkk Genius.
","A true story about the living legend Ron Stallworth who wanted to make a palpable difference in the US. The event took place in the early 70s are s with the help of white man they thwarted some big Ku Klux Klan mischievous schemes.
The movie has an Irrefutable effect in terms of style and storytelling this movie is unequaled. Minorities and immigrants from different ethnicities still putting up with discrimination and intolerance. The story is a little overlong but riveting, you are going to get all sucked in the movie. I didn't like how they portrayed David Luke; in the movie he has facial features of an ordinary guy with non-racist ideologies i believe that this is not biased film its pure reality of the black community back in the seventies when they had to tolerate all that hatred and loathing that came from white supremacists sadly the racism and the hatred still all relevant today as shown during the epilogue. the movie is like a wake-up call to change and to open up our minds.",9,4,11,22 February 2019
Taxi Driver," Loneliness has followed him his whole life everywhere
","Generally This movie's great ,creative scripts by Paul schrader and good directing by the legend Martin scorses. and extraordinary performance by Robert DE niro however this may not gain your liking as a rare genre , we don't usually see these types of confusing movies , the thing is i couldn't know what's the main character's condition is he a sociopath or just emotionally unstable but in my personal point of view he is trying to save specific kind of girls whom he see as lonely and lost girls and try to save them from what he called the filth and scums that's nearly what this film all about and the details is not very important .",7,0,2,19 March 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," The boheiman Freddie.
","This is a wonderful film It's like you watching one of the queen's live performances as if Mercury soul transmigrated into Malik's body, I mean if Freddie himself see this film he will be confused because Malik wore Freddie's character with its nuances. Rami deserves an oscar for his astonishing work he didn't have much of acting experience on big screens, yet he delivered unparalleled rendering and pulled off a ripper it is been the best performance of this year in my opinion, definitely an oscar worthy. Queen fans will have high expectations of this film they will not be disappointed because this is a superb movie. It's onerous to span years of legend's life in a couple of minutes it's not a perfect biopic, but it's thoroughly compelling and simply one of the greatest revelations there is. You will not regret seeing it He made him seem like an incredibly lovely guy I didn't know much about Freddie I heard some of his famous songs but no more. The fun begins in the second half of the movie. If you are old enough this will make you wallow in nostalgia.",8,1,2,25 February 2019
Bird Box," The bird box is useless, it won't save you.
","The movie is about an invisible beauty, not! The director left the viewers to decide, we don't know for certain what's the nature of these entities is. It is a supernatural horror, mystery film with a little of drama, I believe it is mysterious because it misses a lot of expositions, you can guess and say they are monsters or creature of some kind for instance blackhole livings or something but the truth is unknown.
I rated the film 7 because it's bang average.It has a medium intensity, a little machination and a little entertainment it works just fantastically if you're bored. Overall it was almost forgettable and not exceptional experience with a frustrating ending and some will deem it insulting.
I have regard for the concept, but it could have been better!
The plot is pretty good in theory however, they went wrong and made plain mistakes by making each death expected, predictable and almost set-up.
I can say that the movie is saved from a total disgrace by dint of Sandra Bullock's talent.
Regrettably I feel pretty let down. I wouldn't say it's a bad film the performance cast is great and the premise is fine but all of it is potentially lame.",7,0,2,1 July 2019
The Thing," it's going to get alot wose before it gets any better
","This is alien invasion kind of movie that probably was much enjoyable and cool in the old days but not as now ,however you will still be terrified by some scenes if you are interested in strange classic films you may go and take a look at that , otherwise it's a total waste of time .",5,1,11,2 January 2019
Dark City," The drak city might be your city
","This is a thought-provoking movie i really like, if i already watched in the ninties i definetely would have given it 10 but sorry i just watched this in 2019, the idea of altered universe and that we might be living in alien created world is commonly argued nowadays it's surreal and bizarre, i never thought that a guy from the nineties had produced a movie around this hypothesis this what makes this science fiction film special .",8,1,2,18 January 2019
The Favourite," My favourite unwatchable film
","The film is about two women's battle over gaining power and the Queen's fixation using their illimitable astuteness; it wasn't riveting, but it was okay. Lesbianism is a big part of the film that kept me waiting but unfortunately there weren't any intimate scenes that linger long enough. The topic was intricate because I couldn't comprehend anyone's motives the film is filled with ridiculous moments that I don't think are funny in addition to that I think it is too mediocre for an oscar nomination, as for the story it was insipid. To be fair there were some entertaining scenes but overall the film doesn't worth it the acting was the best thing about the movie I reckon Emma performance was enthralling but the storyline is definitely not groundbreaking also the ending wasn't proper.",6,0,3,2 March 2019
Get Out," The conspiracy black people mind controlling
","This movie is unique and real suspenseful thriller , it will give yo more sympathy toward black people you'll get the feeling of how persecuted are the African-Americans , really weird and bizarre not to forget the marvelous acting by the English actor Daniel Kaluuya and how beautiful and shockingly wicked is Allison Williams , i recommend this movie for all horror fans for them to see new idea of scary movie .",9,8,18,22 April 2017
3 Idiots," They are too smart to be idiots.
","This movie came against my expectations due to its title, but when I started watching and as the movie kept progressing it hit me like a thunder because it was entirely opposed to what my preconceived thoughts were. This is an inspirational blockbuster movie, full of sentiments, touches upon critical issues like school stress and it carries varying kinds of moments, funny to deep thought-provoking moments with big significant lessons by the virtue of humor and the witty dialogues that keep you engrossed.
Thanks to the splendid Performance by Amir, he owned it indeed, some other acting crew were average and also I think that the duration was too long and I believe it could have been less longer. I noticed that Indian like their films to surpass the two-hours timeframe which might be deemed to be a weakness because you want to keep the viewers awake and you don't want them to yawning, also films suppose to save time or some viewers rather read the book that this movie was based on, you will be moved by the movie and it will absolutely change your mindset after you will have done.",9,0,0,18 February 2019
Don't Breathe," If he's a blind doesn't necessarily means that he's a saint .
","I'd like to start this review with quotation which recap the movie's plot 'There's nothing a man cannot do once he accepts the fact that there's no god' . The movie shows you the ingenuity of Fede Alvarez's work and how expert he is in this field . The movies wasn't perfect but it is absolutely different and unique , i think it wasn't perfect because of some dumb moves by the burglars characters that i believe won't happen in reality , the light work in this movie is noticeably amazing and worth to be mentioned here and deserve my appreciation so thank you Perdro Luque and thank you producer and all others who participate in making this movies , my recommendation for those who want to watch a unrivaled thriller flick this one you must not miss . finally i'd like to say if you're not the smartest you could be the luckiest like' Rocky' Jane Levy God bless you all .",9,1,4,27 March 2017
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," jejune ideas in unwatchable movie
","Oh my lord, I want my one hour and forty seven minutes back, with all due respect to jason becuase he got his first commercial success off of this, good for him but, this was harrowing movie that i didn't like for too many reasons, firstly the deplorable acting which was not convincing with actors using poor facial expressions secondly the preplexing conversations sometimes i wasn't able to grasp what they were saying, honestly i was dissapointed becuase this film is surely an overrated piece of knickknackery .",5,0,1,17 January 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank , The land of free men .
","I'm not going to spoil or tell you about the scenario of this movie but i'm really excited to review about the lessons i benefited from this masterpiece ,This Movie is a real gem , teach you lots of lessons about life and how bad it can hits you , The movie shows you various kinds of lessons and thoughts and how can you treat them positively , I'm gonna enumerate some of them , first is the real man is the person who can withstand a long term storm and keep going on , second it tells you never miss any opportunity even when it seems dangerous , all you have to do is embrace it , third is knowledge always rescue its seeker , fourth is hard times reveal your real friends who can sedate the pain that hard time give you especially when we're talking about the prison time , fifth is leave your own print in every place you attend just to give a sign or evidence for next visitor that you was there , sixth patience will achieve more than our force so always be patient not hasty and wait for the right time to come , and the last and the greatest quote from this amazing movie is 'Get busy living, or get busy dying ' .",10,0,1,26 November 2016
Black Panther," Imperfect adaptation for the Black Panther.
","This is your typical superhero movie or worse because It was a little frustrating. The cinematography and the sci-fi part were okay, but other than that it was hackneyed scripts unluckily, the film fell short of expectation. Perhaps because of the hype, there were few good acting performances especially in the combat scenes but generally the movie didn't pull me in I find Michael B. Jordan character more fascinating than Chadwick Boseman however still average. The characters are not developing, and that's a snag. The filmmakers didn't evenly focus on all characters. After the first thirty minutes, the movie jumped the shark for me, and I was so bored.
It's too stale for a high budget film like this it had box office success but that shouldn't matter when the movie is not extraordinary and lacks originality.
The African accent was apparently fake; I didn't like the way they forced it to their mouth. It baffles me that this film is nominated for the oscar. Out of generosity I gave this movie six stars.",6,2,4,20 February 2019
