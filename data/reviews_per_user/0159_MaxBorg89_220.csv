Angels & Demons," Vatican Murder Mystery
","Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as 'airplane literature', i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead. Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors). The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?). Then again, no one ever expected the film to change their views on the religion vs. science debate, right?",6,13,22,19 May 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An outstanding conclusion!
","Much of Kill Bill's success depended on how the story would end. It couldn't be too predictable, but not too bizarre either. Luckily, Tarantino came up with one of the most brilliant epilogues in film history. In fact, Kill Bill: Vol.2 could be his absolute masterpiece, alongside Pulp Fiction. It really is that good.Following the events of Vol.1, The Bride (Uma Thurman) has three more people to kill: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, finally, the Man, Bill (David Carradine)! But since there are only three left, what are we gonna see during the rest of the film, the Crazy 88 having already been wiped out in the previous movie? That's what Tarantino aficionados are gonna love: the talky, ironic, totally quotable bits are back (the highlight? Bill revealing the 'truth' about Superman's mythology, just like QT did with Like a Virgin in Reservoir Dogs). Some of the dialogue is reminiscent of Sergio Leone, and that's no coincidence: 75% of the movie is Tarantino's own version of the Spaghetti Western, with Ennio Morricone's music, a homage to the last scene of The Searchers (with Thurman replacing John Wayne) and the fact that most of the story takes place in Texas (we finally get to see the so-called Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre, which includes an intelligent cameo by Samuel L. Jackson). Okay, but what about the remaining 25%? That part (the middle section of the film) shows us how The Bride learned all the various killing techniques she masters, as we witness her brutal training with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, who was Johnny Mo in Vol.1). It looks ugly, but it's one of the most interesting mentor/pupil relationships I've ever seen. If Tarantino had made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Pai Mei chapter of Kill Bill: Vol.2 is probably what it would have looked like.So, now the time has come to talk about what everyone expects to be the unmissable part of this film: the climactic Uma/Bill showdown. Well, without spoiling anything, it's a powerful, emotionally loaded confrontation, a tragic love story, the most touching ending Tarantino has ever filmed. And much of those scenes'beauty lies in the leading couple: Thurman is arguably even better than in Vol.1 (kind of a weird statement, given the two volumes were shot together and meant to be one single film), and Carradine's comeback was worth waiting for, similarly to John Travolta's return to form in Pulp Fiction. The only thing I don't understand is why the Academy ignored two excellent performances such as those we had the luck to see in this movie.I don't think another director would have been able to achieve something this good. Kill Bill belongs to Quentin Tarantino, who has once again proved he can pick up an overused concept and turn it into a remarkable picture.",10,4,8,11 January 2006
Black Swan," A nightmarish dance
","Black Swan was one of the most anticipated movies of the 2010 Venice Film Festival (which is where I saw it), due to Darren Aronofsky's Golden Lion victory two years earlier for The Wrestler. After its premiere screening, on the opening night no less, it was met with conflicting reactions, ranging from sky-high praise to utter indifference, with some even calling it Aronofsky's worst picture alongside the hugely underrated The Fountain. Were such comments deserved? Absolutely not, but that doesn't mean Black Swan is a masterpiece either. In fact, it is fair to call it Aronofsky's least accomplished piece of work.Set in the very familiar (from Aronofsky's films, that is) contemporary New York, Black Sawn is a dark, psychological thriller about two women: Nina (Natalie Portman) and Lily (Mila Kunis). The former is a young, promising member of a local ballet company, which the latter has recently joined. When company director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces his next project is going to be a revival of Swan Lake, he states that Nina is the ideal replacement for former star Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), who is about to retire due to her age. However, Nina has to prove herself worthy of the double role of the fair and innocent Swan Queen and the deceptive, seductive Black Swan, or she will also be replaced. Fearing Lily might steal her thunder, Nina grows more paranoid by the day, while also tapping into her repressed sexuality to find her inner Black Swan.Despite the alleged 'indie' tag (the film is distributed by Fox Searchlight, whose parent company previously financed The Fountain), Black Swan is very much a studio effort, with a budget that, while relatively low (13 million dollars), is more than the cost of Pi, Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler put together (The Fountain, on the other hand, remains Aronofsky's priciest picture). In fact, comparisons with The Wrestler - the director himself has said the two movies are companion pieces - highlight where Black Swan derails: whereas the Mickey Rourke-starring drama was a truly independent film, not to mention Aronofsky's best (and in no small measure because of his decision to let go of his usual directorial tricks), the ballet thriller is a compromise between a studio product - evident in the classic theme, akin to All About Eve, and the cast - and the filmmaker's personal vision, which reverts to Requiem for a Dream sensibilities for a story he didn't write himself.Not that it's necessarily a bad thing: in its most inspired moments, Black Swan is an exquisite picture, pulsating with life and filled with indelible, nightmarish images that showcase the heroine's gradual descent into madness, all coordinated with beautiful choreography and impeccable musical cues. Unfortunately, the second half proves to be too weird for its own good, with a shift in tone that aims for visceral horror - think Polanski mixed with early Cronenberg - but gets caught up in some decidedly embarrassing moments, most notably the bulk of scenes involving a hammy Barbara Hershey as Nina's overbearing mother.And yet it holds up until the end, and not just thanks to a lesbian sex scene that is bound to become a guilty pleasure lynch-pin. While the director's idiosyncrasies may get out of hand, his cast is fully committed and delivers solid work throughout (well, minus Hershey): Cassel is as enjoyably nasty as ever, and Kunis, who unexpectedly won the Mastroianni Award in Venice, finally sheds off the memory of Max Payne and American Psycho 2 and establishes herself as a promising dramatic actress. As for Portman, her schizophrenic role is one of the bravest she's ever tackled, and she remains a majestic, compelling presence for the duration of the movie, while Ryder nearly manages to steal her thunder with just a handful of scenes that ring scarily true: being herself in her late thirties during the shoot, the actress knows all too well what it's like to risk becoming a has-been, and gives an angry, unforgettable performance that should get her an Oscar.Black Swan is a dazzling, spellbinding and frustrating picture. Tonally uneven and occasionally self-indulgent, it nevertheless manages to seduce and intrigue and, at its best, reminds us that Aronofsky is one of the most original and visionary names in contemporary American cinema.",7,6,15,6 December 2010
Changeling," A mother's pain
","When Changeling was screened in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, a lot of people assumed it was a lock for the Palme d'Or, given none other than Sean Penn, whom Clint Eastwood had directed to an Oscar with Mystic River, was the President of the Jury. Instead, good old Clint had to settle for a Special Award for the whole of his career. While this might not qualify as a proper award (in fact, it was made up on the spot so that he and the female winner, Catherine Deneuve, didn't leave Cannes empty-handed), it's a fitting tribute to a great filmmaker who, at the age of 78, shows no signs of tiredness or mediocrity, as proved by Changeling, another sober yet merciless look at the underbelly of American society.The movie takes us back to that most cinematic of cities, Los Angeles, in the year 1928 (two years before Clint himself was born, by the way). The shockingly true story told here is that of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single mother whose only concern is the happiness of her 9-year old son Walter. It's no surprise, then, that she almost loses her mind when he disappears without a trace. The real surprise, to the LAPD at least, is that she refuses to recognize the boy they bring back months later: he claims to be Walter Collins, and Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) summons several experts to explain some of the visible changes (the kid is shorter, not to mention circumcised) in a logical way, but Christine refuses to believe those lies, and with the help of a priest (John Malkovich) who uses his radio program to publicly denounce the bad side of law enforcement she sets out to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.Like most masters of today, Eastwood uses the period piece gimmick to really tell a story that concerns our present situation: in this case, as has often been done previously (see L.A. Confidential), corruption within the police and its effect on the general public. Changeling is also a different take on a broader subject - the inefficiencies of the justice system - Clint has handled many times before, as both a star (the Dirty Harry cycle) and a director (True Crime, Blood Work, Mystic River). He takes advantage of the setting to tell the staggering tale, brought to the screen by sci-fi and comic-book writer J. Michael Straczynski (of Babylon 5 fame), and it does in fact look like it had really been made in the late '20s or early '30s: the cinematography, in particular, is reminiscent of what he did with his WWII double bill, especially Latters from Iwo Jima, which was almost black and white. It was made today, but could just as easily have been produced seventy years ago (with the swearing removed, of course), and like most well told period stories it holds up perfectly in our times as well.Then there's Jolie, who constitutes an entire chapter by herself: she was reportedly cast because she was the only actress who had that special something that defined movie stars during Hollywood's Golden Age (in fact, she was attached to the project before it even had a director), something which was visually enhanced with little but vital make-up. She returns the favor with a performance that exudes rare pain and power, a career-topping effort that is, for good reasons, earning her more Oscar buzz than any other actress this year. To say that this is her best work since Girl, Interrupted (for which she won an Academy Award) isn't enough: it is likely that with this and the equally difficult role she had in A Mighty Heart she may have reached the climax of her notable talent, which has been wasted in the past on crap like the Tomb Raider films. Needless to say, everyone else in the excellent cast pales next to her, which is probably why there's no other A-lister in the movie, minus Malkovich who turns out to be a very good choice thanks to his trademark old-fashioned, stage-like acting style.Most people mellow with age. Clint Eastwood doesn't: after the likes of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, he delivers another uncompromising, unmissable study of human behavior at its noblest (a mother's attempts to find her son) and at the same time most inhumane (the LAPD's reaction to Christine's 'crusade')",10,8,13,26 December 2008
Scarface," Say hello to Al Pacino!
","Brian De Palma is one of the most talented directors around, even if he hasn't done a really great film since Carlito's Way (Mission:Impossible was good, but not exactly the flawless thriller you'd expect from the man who gave us Blow Out, Body Double and other fine Hitchcock homages). Until a week ago, I thought that if I had to choose only one De Palma movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would be The Untouchables. Then I saw Scarface, and everything changed.Like The Godfather, Goodfellas and Casino (whose tag-line, 'No one stays at the top forever.', is perfect for this film as well), Scarface showcases a criminal's slow rise to absolute power, and the events which will lead to his inevitable downfall. It's a painful, very gory journey (it's not as bloody as Carrie, also by De Palma, but quite close), and the problem is, the audience likes it. But then, who wouldn't want to get the most by doing the least? If it wasn't for the carnage that derives, it wouldn't be such a bad idea. That's the best thing with these movies: they show you how cool it could be to live like a gangster, before shocking you with the downside of the whole story.But Scarface's greatness isn't all due to De Palma's direction. No, we have two other people to thank too: one is Oliver Stone, who wrote the eternally quotable dialogue ('You know what capitalism is? Getting f**ked!';'You wanna play games? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!'). But it's Al Pacino's Tony Montana who made this film an instant classic. The crook who just wants to make things better for himself and his family and turns into the Cuban equivalent of Michael Corleone (another essential Pacino role) is the best work he's ever done, not to mention his own favorite of all the characters he has played, and while I was watching him, a thought started circling in my head, the same thought that showed up when I saw Reese Witherspoon in Election and Uma Thurman in Kill Bill: where the hell is his Best Actor Oscar? The fact that he didn't even receive a nomination, just like the aforementioned actresses, is one of the worst crimes in cinema history.Still, that inexplicable omission by the Academy doesn't prevent Scarface from being one of the greatest movies of all time. If you like gangster movies, this seminal '80s flick has to be seen.",10,1,3,2 March 2006
Frost_Nixon," 'Are you saying the President can do something illegal?'
","Apparently, Frost/Nixon was a bit of a plan B for Ron Howard, who shot the movie while waiting for the WGA strike (November 2007-February 2008) to end, since it affected the production start of the Da Vinci Code sequel Angels & Demons (Frost/Nixon was unaffected, given that British writers, such as Peter Morgan, aren't WGA members). Ironically, what was an afterthought has turned out to be his best movie to date, or at least on par with Apollo 13 (and this comes from one of the many who think A Beautiful Mind shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 2002).Based on Morgan's own play, which has been widely acclaimed both in London's West End and on Broadway, Frost/Nixon is a fictionalized account of a very real event: the interviews Richard Nixon granted British journalist David Frost. It all starts in 1974, when the Watergate scandal becomes public knowledge and Nixon (Frank Langella) is forced to resign, despite being subsequently acquitted of all charges in a trial. Frost (Michael Sheen), a talk show host, is in Australia when this happens, and once he returns to London he tells his producer John Birt (Matthew MacFadyen) he has a brilliant idea for an interview: the disgraced ex-President. He takes it very lightly at first, thinking it will be nothing more than a chance to achieve greater fame, but after meeting his key researchers, Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell), he realizes he's been given the opportunity to stage the trial Nixon never had. However, as Zelnick promptly points out, 'there's a reason they call him Tricky Dick', and so the former President, who's in it only for the money, works up a plan with his assistant, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), so that Frost will be metaphorically crushed when the interviews begin. Thus, what will later be remembered as a TV event is set in motion.A film based on a play about television isn't a pitch you hear every day, and in fact the idea would be terrible with the wrong material. It just so happens, then, that Frost/Nixon works a lot better as a movie than a play: whereas the stage version will inevitably favor the remarkable acting (more on that later) over the story's specific context and setting, the film transition allows the director to explore the medium of television, using archive news footage and samples of real Nixon appearances to emphasize the role of the small screen in the picture. In that sense, Howard is the perfect choice - not only has he dealt with the subject before, albeit less successfully (that would be EdTV), his background is in television (Happy Days), therefore he knows his tools better than most of the other directors that were considered for the job (the only reasonable alternative would have been George Clooney). This is openly acknowledged within the film itself, when Rockwell's character comments on 'the reductive power of the close-up', an instrument that can make or break any screen production, whether it's film or TV.Performance-wise, Howard is also deserving of credit for insisting that the two leads from the play reprise their roles in the film, or else he would have turned down the job. The gamble pays off exquisitely, as both Sheen and Langella have a long-lasting silver screen experience (they have even played other iconic figures like Tony Blair and Dracula respectively) and are allowed to build on their stage work surrounded by a typically (for Howard, that is) spot-on supporting cast. Sheen, ostensibly the hero of the tale, has the diffic ult task of portraying an ambitious entertainer without making him look like a buffoon, much like he did with his role as Blair in The Queen, and succeeds in delivering a layered, multi-dimensional performance that lets us see Frost the man, not the TV personality. Langella has the more challenging job, namely handling a part that, movie-wise, everyone still associates with Anthony Hopkins. As it turns out, his Nixon is a towering but flawed presence, a charismatic leader whose weaknesses and arrogance ultimately led him to a very public downfall. In short, it's a more interesting version than what we saw in Oliver Stone's more straightforward biopic.Bottom line: Frost/Nixon is a compelling portrait of one of the most important televised events of the entire 20th century, a brilliant examination of television as a medium and an extraordinary piece of material for actors. And that's without mentioning the greatest irony of all: Ron Howard voted for Nixon back in 1972...",9,3,6,3 March 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The most outrageously hilarious movie in recent years... A comic triumph!
","Having shamelessly offended anyone he could find on his Ali G Show, it was about time British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen moved to the big screen. This proved a bit hard, though, as the Ali G movie tanked and the politically incorrect actor was forced to accept smaller roles in mainstream comedies, often turning out to be the most memorable thing in those films (case in point: his ace vocal performance as the lemur king in the otherwise hardly inspired Madagascar). In 2006, however, Baron Cohen took the world by storm with the big-screen version of Borat, another famous creation of his, and its impact on modern comedy is likely to last.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (while hosting an MTV program in character, the actor jokingly said 'That's the abridged title!') follows the misadventures of Kazakhstan's most famous (?) reporter, Borat Sagdijev (Baron Cohen), a man who's really proud of his country, even if, according to him, every town has its own rapist, it's all right to have sex with 12-year olds and his sister is 'the number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan'. All he has to say about these things is 'Nice!'. Soon after-wards, though, he admits not everything is fine. In his own words: 'Although Kazakhstan glorious country, it have problem too: economic, social, and Jew. This is why Ministry of Information have decide to send me to US and A to learn a lessons for Kazakhstan'. Accompanied by his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) and carrying nothing but 'clothings, US dollars and a jar of Gypsy tears to protect me from AIDS', the wild journalist sets out to make a documentary about the American values his country could benefit from, only to change his mind once he sees Baywatch on TV and decides to make it his mission to 'uncork' Pamela Anderson. This still won't prevent him from upsetting as many people as possible on the way...In most comedies, the protagonist has one bad characteristic, which he will compensate in some way throughout the movie. Borat, however, is not going to compensate a thing, since he incarnates all bad sides of mankind. Racism? Check (he describes an African-American interviewee as 'a real-life chocolate face. No make-up'). Anti-semitism? Check (he refuses to travel by plane 'in case the Jews decide to repeat their attack of 9/11'). Misogyny? Heck, yeah (he claims women have brains the size of a squirrel's, and when he's told his wife just died, his reaction is 'High Five!'). And let's not forget his problems with the English language (he mistakes 'retired' for 'retard') or misconceptions about etiquette ('What do I say when I need to go to the sh*t hole?'). This is a man who has plenty of (wrong) things to say and isn't afraid of saying them. And while most of his 'victims' would rather lynch him, the film's funniest moments derive from the few times people actually SHARE his 'beliefs'. The standout? The now legendary rodeo sequence, which sees the audience (totally unaware of the fact Baron Cohen was just acting) cheer as Borat makes statements like 'May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq!'Some have found Baron Cohen's style inappropriate, since most of the people who appear in the film were made to believe Borat was an actual Kazakhstani reporter doing a documentary about the USA. That's actually the whole point: if those men and women had known the truth, their reactions wouldn't have been so real and undeniably funny, and the movie would have been much less effective. Beneath the tons of bad taste and crude humor (including a naked wrestling match in a hotel room) lies one of the sharpest satires of all time, using the defects of its 'hero' to expose those of an entire nation. The truth is that, like it or not, we're all a little bit like Borat (although I doubt most car salesmen would seriously say a Corvette or a Hummer is the best vehicle to seduce 'women with a shave down below').Ultimately, despite all bad stuff he says and does, Borat is a very charismatic guy, and most certainly one of the most brilliant comedic creations in recent history. Chances are viewers might even want to join in when the (fake) Kazakhstani anthem starts playing over the end credits: 'Kazakhstan greatest country in the world/ All other countries are run by little girls...'Chenquieh!",10,1,27,27 March 2007
Alien 3," Flawed but underrated third installment in the Alien saga
","Following the success of Alien, any sequel had a LOT to live up to. With Aliens, James Cameron's second installment in the franchise, being every bit as flawless as Ridley Scott's original creature feature, to say David Fincher, the director of Alien 3, was under a great deal of pressure is probably an understatement. In fact, continuous interference from the studio made the first-timer so nervous and frustrated he eventually left during post-production, refused to make any kind of contribution to the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set (where his directorial debut was shown in two versions, the theatrical cut and the so called Assembly Cut, which was meant to be closer to Fincher's vision) and even turned down Mission: Impossible III because he claimed to have 'already f*cked up one movie with a '3' in the title'. His feelings may be justified, but as flawed as it may be (and it is in certain parts), Alien 3 is actually a quite respectable picture.Just like Cameron did in 1986, Fincher decides to sever all ties with the previous film by having Hicks (Michael Biehn) and Newt (Carrie Henn), the only two people, besides Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who survived the attack of the Alien queen, die during the opening credits (an effective intro, but it does sort of make the conclusion of Aliens pointless), thus leaving the series' heroine all by herself when she reaches a bizarre planet known as Fiorina 161. Here the Weyland-Butani company, the same that financed the missions in the first two films, has had a maximum security prison built to keep dangerous criminals under surveillance. At first, Ripley's only problem is getting along with these people, who are mostly religious fanatics. Later, when a few mysterious deaths occur, she realizes she didn't reach Fiorina 161 alone, and the nightmare that has haunted her for years is far from over.For a first-time director, Fincher shows a confidence which is rare when tackling projects this huge: while he can't be compared to Scott or Cameron, he has managed to take the claustrophobia that permeated the first Alien and enhance it, making Alien 3 exactly as chilling as its predecessors and successfully anticipating his later work (especially Se7en and Panic Room). Also skillful is Weaver who, having already played the character twice, knows what can be done with Ripley and takes her to new levels, both physical (she has no hair for most of the film) and emotional (her 'relationship' with the aliens). Sadly, none of the other characters are as appealing, despite some of them being played by quite talented people (Pete Postlethwaite and Charles S. Dutton among them). The only possible exception is Lance Henriksen 'returning' as Bishop, only his appearance is too brief and too late into the movie to really make a difference. The real problem of this film, however, is the alien itself: what was a menacing presence in the hands of Scott and Cameron is reduced to an ugly example of early CGI, which actually looks WORSE as the movie progresses. While it is kept in the shadows, it can get away with its awfulness; once exposed, though, it is almost too pitiful to watch.Overall, this is neither the masterpiece some had expected nor the total trash Fincher erroneously thinks he made. In fact, whatever defects the film has, he completely redeems himself with the climax, one of the bleakest, most audacious in cinema history (another Fincher trademark), so brilliant it will make one wish Fox had never even thought of an Alien 4. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. But that should not affect the viewers' feelings towards number 3: on its own, it is a pretty damn good sci-fi flick.",8,2,7,15 May 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Pardon the pun, but this is incredibly good!
","X-Men: big franchise. Spider-Man: ditto. In fact, even Fantastic Four was granted a sequel. But not good old Hulk: despite the best efforts on behalf of director Ang Lee and a cast that included Eric Bana and Nick Nolte, the green giant's big screen outing, though lauded by most critics and, to lesser extent, fans, wasn't big enough at the box office to convince Universal another installment was a good idea. Now, with the studio merely distributing (Marvel itself threw in the cash, which is also why there are no legal obstacles to having other characters from different comics in the film - more on that later) and a completely renewed cast and crew, The Incredible Hulk is a noble and for the most part successful attempt to reboot the series, a bit like Batman Begins.Technically, this is not a sequel to Lee's film (the opening montage depicts a completely different explanation for the Hulk's origin), but it is indicated that five years have passed since Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) disappeared from the United States (and there is a five-year gap between the release of the two movies), and the story begins in South America, where the previous version ended. To be more specific, Banner is hiding in Brazil, trying to control his rage and having no contact with the outside world, except for occasional e-mails with a certain Mr. Blue (Banner calls himself Mr. Green, obviously), who might succeed in finding a cure for the protagonist's condition. But while he may avoid others, others are looking for him, and a radiation-related accident (which has to do with Stan Lee's mandatory appearance) enables General Ross (William Hurt) to locate him and send a team, led by the slightly insane Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), to get him. The rest of the plot is rather basic: Banner is on the run, he becomes the Hulk on a few occasions, returns to the US and has no ally besides Mr. Blue and old flame Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Oh, and did I mention Blonsky decides to become a monster himself in order to bring a little fairness to the game?The script, which is largely influenced by the '70s TV show, with the addition of Bruce Jones' comic-book cycle (the Mr. Blue subplot is lifted from his arc), aims to solve the one problem many think caused Lee's take on the subject to alienate fans: there was too much psychology/emotion, not enough action (some people made the same remark about Superman Returns). For that reason, hiring The Transporter director Louis Leterrier seemed like a logical choice, although there was doubt regarding his ability to handle what little 'deeper material' there has to be in a picture like this. That he succeeds is nearly all thanks to Norton: not only does he play Banner with a conviction few would have in a role like this (then again, he's already dealt with multiple personalities in Primal Fear and Fight Club), but he also co-wrote the screenplay with Zak Penn (the sole credited writer), his deep knowledge of the comic proving a great asset when it comes to finding the right mixture of action, drama and humor (the 'hungry/angry' joke is one of the best). But this isn't just Norton's movie: Roth, the actor formerly known as Mr. Orange, is joyously manic, and Tim Blake Nelson's sequel-suggesting presence comes close to marvelous.Any complaints? Actually, yes: Tyler, despite her fair share of blockbuster experience, brings very little of significance to her character, not counting a couple of scenes, and the inevitable climactic showdown between 'hero' and villain could have been reduced by at least five minutes. But hey, at least we get a Hulk that looks a lot better than the 'poor man's Shrek' seen in the 2003 version. Plus, he finally utters the famous line 'Hulk smash!' (with Lou Ferrigno's voice, no less). That, in addition to a really great cameo by Robert Downey Jr. (which, unlike Sam Jackson's role in Iron Man, has not become a post-credits 'surprise'), indicates that if a second (or third, depending on how you interpret the connection between the films) movie gets made, it's gonna be pretty, well, incredible.",7,4,7,24 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Pure adrenaline from start to finish!
","'Who are you? Do you have a wife? A girlfriend? Whoever she is, I'm gonna find her. I'm gonna hurt her. And then I'm going to kill you, right in front of her.' These lines, spoken by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) at the beginning of the trailer, gave plenty of people the creeps, suggesting J.J.Abrams, the man behind Alias (whose narrative structure is echoed here) and Lost, was the right choice to direct Mission:Impossible III (and this is his feature debut). Here we had what looked like an action flick where the talky bits are exactly as important as the explosions. The actual movie is everything fans hoped for, the best in the trilogy, an exciting adventure in which style and content are present in equal quantities.Abrams makes the film more emotional than its predecessors, thanks to his choice to answer this question: what if you work for a top secret government agency (in this case, IMF), and your enemies decide to get at you through your unknowing loved ones? This situation caused Sidney Bristow, the protagonist of Alias, quite some trouble. And the same trouble is waiting for Ethan Hunt, who is once again dragged into action (this time, the self-destructing message is inside a camera). What seemed like an ordinary rescue mission (his former student, played by Keri Russell, has been kidnapped) becomes something much, much bigger, as Ethan and his team (veteran Ving Rhames and first-timers Maggie Q. and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, whose accent weirdly shifts from American to Cockney to Irish, depending on the section of the film) cross paths with the aforementioned Davian, a ruthless arms dealer who, after being arrested (his chilling 'do you have a wife?' speech is pronounced during the interrogation), manages to escape, in the breathtaking Chesapeake Bay Bridge scene, and blackmails Hunt: if he can't find the Rabbit's Foot in 48 hours, his wife Julie (Michelle Monaghan) will die. Difficult times lie ahead...From Berlin to Rome to Shanghai, M:I:III is an unstoppable race against the clock, spiced up by clever dialogue and layered, compelling characters. In fact, we get to take a proper look at the IMF headquarters and some of the important people who work there, particularly the strict, but hard-working boss (Laurence Fishburne), the reliable handler (Billy Crudup) and the hilarious tech adviser, played by the priceless Simon Pegg as the British version of Alias' Marshall Flinkman. And finally, a villain worth the definition. Hoffman already stole the show in the trailer, and he virtually dominates the whole film with controlled but frightening brutality. He's arguably the scariest and most interesting adversary Ethan hunt has ever faced.With his feature debut, Abrams has successfully redeemed the M:I franchise, after John Woo's disappointing second installment, delivering an almost perfect picture (the movie goes a bit downhill during the last 20 minutes). He has brought the genre to the next level and the good news is, he's barely started.",8,0,2,7 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 22 years later, in a galaxy far, far away...
","George Lucas recently stated special effects are tools to help create movies, and he also said a special effect without a story is quite boring. He's right.Star Wars Episode I is enjoyable, but its main strength lies in the CG sequences, which are impressive, though some of them seem to be screaming:'Look at what you can do with modern technology!'.The story, about how Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi met Anakin Skywalker, isn't bad, but there are a few elements that make it a bit, uh, ridiculous: 1.The midi-chlorians: was it necessary to add information about the Force's origin when no one asked for it? 2.Darth Maul:He's only a puppet in the Sith lord's hands, and the only line he says in the entire film is pretty forgettable; 3.Jar Jar Binks: He was supposed to add humor to the movie? We already had C-3PO doing that! Even the Ewoks are better than Jar Jar.Lucas tries to compensate these flaws with the previously mentioned CG and some good acting (particularly Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman), but in the end this is the one Star Wars episode that doesn't justify repeated viewings.6,5/10",5,0,2,20 September 2005
The Hangover," What happened in Vegas?
","Parties, people getting drunk, embarrassing moments: all classic components of American comedy, all done to death. And yet The Hangover managed to become one of the big hits of summer 2009, with some critics and viewers even praising it as 'the funniest movie in years'. While that definition is entirely arbitrary (and used a bit too often), it is true that Todd Phillips' latest achievement manages the near impossible: to take an overly familiar topic and turn it into an unpredictable, hilarious ride.What's it all about then? Well, there's a guy named Doug (Justin Bartha) who's getting married, and as per American (comedy) tradition his friends want to make sure his last days of 'freedom' are spent in the best way. Hence a trip to Vegas - where else? - in the company of fun-loving school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), uptight dentist Stu (Ed Helms, aka Andy from the US version of The Office) and the bride's 'weird' brother Alan (stand-up comedian Zach Galifianakis), all prepared for a night of fun they will never forget. Until the next morning, that is: the hotel room is a mess, Stu's missing a tooth, there's a tiger in the bathroom and someone left a baby in the closet. Oh yeah, and Doug has disappeared...From there on, The Hangover turns into a comedic whodunit, with the guys trying to retrace their steps so that the wedding can actually happen. Cue encounters with the police (ouch), a stripper (Heather Graham on top form), a naked Chinese gangster (Ken Jeong) and Mike Tyson. All this is handled expertly by Phillips, working from a script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the writers of Four Christmases; don't ask) that brings him back to the more 'juvenile' territory of Road Trip and Old School after the big-screen 'revisit' of Strasky & Hutch. The difference is this time greater care has been put into the writing, with a great combination of clever plot structure and endearing characterizations. Sure, the three leads are essentially comedy types (especially Alan, who at times channels John Belushi), but they manage to remain real, believable and, most importantly, relatable.Nevertheless, there are a few minor defects that prevent the movie from being the outright comedic masterpiece some claim it to be. For one thing, it's very much a guy movie, with the female characters (including Graham) reduced to scenery-filling beauties or, as in the case of Stu's 'sweetheart', annoyances. Also, the film doesn't really go all the way with the madness, opting for a safe, hollow final-reel solution instead of the truly dark and insane material the premise - and the R-rating - could and would have allowed (think Scorsese's After Hours with more sex jokes).But hey, why complain when most of the film is absolutely hilarious? The Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis trio is a genuinely adorable bunch of losers, and Phillips elicits laughs with all kinds of humor, both verbal ('What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Except herpes.') and physical (all the bits with the tiger and/or the baby), by subverting some clichés - much like Reservoir Dogs was a heist movie without the actual heist, this film deals with the aftermath of a night we never see - and indulging others ('He's funny because he's fat' one character says of Alan, and he's got a point). Throw in a bunch of funny references (Star Trek's 'I'm a doctor' gag is used brilliantly) and one of those absolute rarities in recent comedies (i.e. closing credits that aren't skippable), and you've got one hell of a fun, funny movie.",8,1,2,12 January 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The adventure of a lifetime!
","When it comes to picking my favorite Steven Spielberg film, I never quite know which one to choose. To make things easier, I divided the movies in two categories: serious and 'popcorn' (in the good sense of the word, naturally). As far as the first group is concerned, there is no doubt: the best of the serious films is Schindler's List, tightly followed by Saving Private Ryan. But in the blockbuster group, the dilemma emerges again: Jaws? E.T.? Close Encounters? They're all so good it's damn near impossible to select an absolute favorite. And then a series of images and sounds come to mind: boulders, Nazis, snakes, the legendary theme by John Williams, and many others, all related to the best trilogy of the '80s (yes, even better than Star Wars), and most of all to the unsurpassed first installment: Raiders of the Lost Ark.Explicitly conceived by George Lucas as a revival of the adventure serials he enjoyed as a kid, Raiders has one word written all over it: fun. That's its reason to exist, and it never fails to deliver on those terms. From the moment archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is introduced, surviving death traps in South America, you know you're in for two hours of flawless entertainment: starting in the jungle, continuing in the desert and climaxing on a mountain top, Raiders takes Indiana, and the viewer, around the world on a never-ending ride disguised as the quest for the Ark of the Covenant.The magic of the film, as pointed out by Total Film, is all in Spielberg's approach to the story: the sillier the concept, the less seriously you have to take it. Several lesser directors (Michael Bay first and foremost) have done exactly the opposite, sucking all the fun out of the picture. Raiders, on the other hand, rises above all its imitators because it knows how far from realistic Lawrence Kasdan's terrific screenplay is and turns that into an asset: Hitler's passion for the occult might even be based on fact, but the chances of Nazis cooperating with a French scumbag (Paul Freeman, excellent) to retrieve a source of unlimited mystic power are slim to say the least. Yeah, so what? The dialogue is consistently quotable, the music instantly hummable and the action scenes justly deemed some of the best ever filmed.And then there's Ford: humane, sardonic, occasionally rude, occasionally a bad-ass, constantly lovable. Having already worked with Lucas on American Graffiti and Star Wars, he knows the right way to play the part and does so with utmost perfection. His charisma is ideally matched by Indiana's fundamental quality: he is no superhero, just a regular person who gets dragged in extraordinary situations. Also, for a genre defined by the charms of James Bond, he is all but invincible with the ladies, his love-hate relationship with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the first and best of the 'Indy girls', going in the most unexpected directions for the whole duration of the feature. He's a unique character, aided by equally unique sidekicks (Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies) in a most outstanding genre picture.To be brief: there is no reason why Raiders of the Lost Ark, alongside the other Indy movies, shouldn't be on every must-see list in the world. The Indiana Jones trilogy is a faultless combination of B-movie spirit and A-list talent that can't be described as a simple series of adventure or action films: it practically constitutes a genre of its own.",10,1,2,25 May 2008
Spartacus," Much more than just 'Kubrick's Hollywood movie'
","Though it is now recognized as a classic, Spartacus was notoriously disinherited by its director, the late, great Stanley Kubrick. His hatred for said picture derived from the fact that he wasn't involved with the project from the start (which is why his name is nowhere to be found in the screen writing credits), but hired only after original director Anthony Mann was fired (the only remains of the latter's work is the opening sequence). Given Kubrick always demanded total control over his pictures, it is understandable that he came to despise his only real 'Hollywood movie'. Nevertheless, Spartacus is a great picture, one that, alongside Ben-Hur, has defined the epic genre for years (and if the best they can make nowadays is Alexander, then its position remains unharmed).The film stars Kirk Douglas, one of the few actors to have worked twice with the director (their previous collaboration was the anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory), as the eponymous slave who finds himself in the middle of a political war between Roman senators such as Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Seeing the chaos that is rising throughout Italy, he decides to organize a rebellion, gathering a massive group of followers, including Crassus' former servant Antoninus (Tony Curtis). As the situation gets more preoccupying, the common people watch as Rome is threatened by thousands of 'inferior' individuals, led by a charismatic man who believes in justice and freedom.It is probably the aforementioned beliefs that upset Kubrick, famous as he was for almost celebrating misery and decadence in his films. In fact, despite the famous all-but-cheerful ending (brilliantly spoofed in Monty Python's Life of Brian), Spartacus is one of cinema's best representations of free will and courage prevailing over oppression. Much of this is due to Douglas' performance: playing it both ferociously determined (when Spartacus lectures his comrades and prepares for the imminent battle) and touchingly tender (when he meets his future wife, played by Jean Simmons), his performance transcends the character's mythical status and lends him a humanity that makes him instantly likable. Also remarkable are Peter Ustinov, playing slave merchant Batiatus (and winning an Oscar for it), and Olivier, particularly in the now infamous, audacious for the time, seduction scene with Curtis, where food is used as a metaphor for men and women (ironic, if you consider Olivier's part in that scene had to be re-recorded by Anthony Hopkins).The best epics are those that blend the spectacular and the personal, and that is where Spartacus truly succeeds: like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia, it never sacrifices characterization in favor of action, but lets the mesmerizing (and, as opposed to more recent genre films, bloodless) battle sequences be a part of the protagonists' development, bringing the movie closer to Asian 'wuxia' movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Hollywood blockbusters like Troy.So, in a time where the epic has lost most of its charm, movies like Spartacus are even more essential now than they were before. It may have been dismissed by Kubrick himself, but everyone seems to like it, and for a good reason: there is a heart beating beneath the eye-popping exterior.",9,1,2,21 July 2007
United 93," A shocking, heartbreaking tribute to the victims of 9/11
","2006 was a memorable year for movies, for many reasons. One such reason is the fact that for the first time Hollywood had the guts to tackle a painful subject like 9/11, only five years after that terrible day. While Oliver Stone's World Trade Center was a decent film, it suffered from the occasional 'inspired' auteur touches, which were meant to add emotional power but actually made the movie more pretentious. United 93, on the other hand, stands out as the better of the two achievements because of its straightforward approach to the events: no contrivances, no hidden messages, no attempt to glamorize the tragedy. Just good old honest storytelling.The film deals with the hijacking of the titular aircraft, the only one, of the four that were taken on September 11, that didn't hit its target. The reason? The passengers and crew, knowing they would probably die anyway, decided to try and stop the terrorists nonetheless, so that they could have at least one chance to see their loved ones again. This part of the story doesn't actually take place until one hour into the movie, as the director Paul Greengrass builds up the suspense by cutting between the plane calmly flying on its designed route, airports suddenly realizing some aircrafts are missing, and the military wondering what's going on. Then the WTC is attacked, panic breaks loose on the ground and in the air and all everyone can do is stand and watch the images of the Twin Towers falling apart, asking in horror how this can be possible. From this point on, the outcome of the events is painfully obvious.United 93 is a gripping, staggering picture. Much of its impact is due to Greengrass's documentary-style direction: the film is shot entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it a more realistic tone; the characters are all portrayed by unknown actors, allowing the audience to connect with all of them, not just one or two 'team leaders'; and, most crucially, the events occur in real time, adding to the nerve-wrecking tension. All these elements contribute in making the movie an almost unbearably intense experience. Such is the power of the film some might even not be able to watch the last five minutes, where the pain and suspense reach their emotionally exhausting climax. We feel for these people because they were the kind we would run into every day. Unlike the firefighters in Oliver Stone's 9/11 film, the plane's passengers didn't deal with potentially lethal situations on a regular basis, and their sacrifice had nothing to do with patriotism: they did it to save their own lives, perfectly aware of the risks and the slim chances to succeed. And while it's sometimes hard to watch, United 93 is a remarkable tribute to their courage.",10,2,4,23 January 2007
In Bruges," Two Irishmen go to Belgium...
","British gangster film: a genre that, apart from Guy Ritchie's films and Sexy Beast, has gone pretty much unnoticed for quite some time. So what makes Martin McDonagh's feature debut any different from the rest? What justifies its status as a really good gangster movie? Well, for starters, there's a lot of religious symbolism, which fits in nicely with the incessant profanity and occasional bouts of outrageous violence. Second, and this is the real selling point: it takes place in Bruges.For anyone who's never been to the beautiful Belgian city (the official name is actually Brugge, since it's in the Dutch-speaking part of the country), McDonagh's film can serve as a satisfying tour guide, despite the consistent complaints from Ray (Colin Farrell), who calls the place 'a sh*thole'. Not that he is there willingly: he screwed up an assignment (he's a hit-man, you know), and so he and his mentor Ken are hiding abroad for a couple of weeks until their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) calls with new instructions. And while Ken laps up the gorgeous architecture, medieval streets and museums, Ray says that unless he was retarded and had grown up on a farm, there's no way Bruges could ever impress him.Then, all of a sudden, Ray has an epiphany: a film set where the main character is a rude midget (Jordan Prentice). He bonds with the little fella, falls in love with a woman named Chloe (Clémence Poésy, aka Fleur Delacour from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), and starts appreciating the town a bit more (plus, a little cocaine never detracts from the pleasure). And just as things are beginning to shape up, Harry and his instructions show up for a 'social call'.The stark contrast between beauty (the landscape) and ugliness (the language and eventual bloodshed) is the key ingredient of In Bruges' weird appeal. In fact, the two aspects come together when Ken and Ray are admiring a series of paintings by famous artist Hyeronimus Bosch and Ray just can't take his eyes off 'The Last Judgement', a splendid yet shocking depiction of the afterlife. This is also where the film's underlying spiritual theme is unveiled: the two protagonists are seeking redemption, and Bruges is their Purgatory (although Ray has another opinion on the matter: 'This is what Hell must be like: spending the rest of eternity in f*cking Bruges!'). It may seem a bit far-fetched, but then again the characters themselves describe Bruges as something out of a fairy tale, thus justifying the movie's surreal turns (not least the fact, and it's no coincidence, that the movie-within-the-movie is inspired by Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now).But the real beauty of In Bruges doesn't lie in the setting alone: who's there is also a crucial element. Gleeson is, as expected, a tough but ultimately loving presence, and Fiennes, though ostensibly ripping off Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast (but hey, so did Alec Baldwin in The Cooler), especially the language ('He swears a lot, doesn't he?' says Ray), adds an extra notch of creepiness to what is fundamentally the villain of the piece (of course, the main characters are all gangsters, so it's a pretty strange distinction). And then there's Colin Farrell, a revelation in spite of his being in the business for over a decade. It was a given that he's a good actor (just look at Tigerland, Phone Booth or Miami Vice), but the comic and dramatic heights he reaches here, with a deeply sad yet endearingly entertaining performance (for which he won a deserved Golden Globe), show that he's still got a lot to give, and it's an impressive lot, judging from this film.Bottom line: In Bruges is brutal, filled with expletives, visually irresistible, boasts terrific acting and comes with a fascinating religious subtext. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but any lover of the gangster genre ought to check out an opus so postmodern that it actually has a conversation where one character asks two people to put their guns down and one of the shooters replies: 'Don't be stupid. This is the shootout.'.",9,1,3,23 January 2009
Monty Python's Life of Brian," If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten...
","... And that's to watch a Monty Python film and laugh yourself to death. Their sense of humor hasn't dated a bit, and it still satisfies audiences around the world. Life of Brian was released in 1979, but it keeps ranking high in people's TOP 10 comedy lists (in my case, it shares the first place with Young Frankenstein). Even the most depressed people in the universe will feel happy again once they've seen this incredibly funny movie.Now, a short message to those intimidated by the fact that Life of Brian was banned in some countries (though eventually released after a few years) for its supposed 'blasphemy': there is nothing blasphemous in this film. All right, it makes fun of prophets, messiahs, wise men and crucifixion, and yes, Jesus does show up for a couple of seconds, in the infamous 'Blessed are the cheese-makers' sequence, but the Pythons didn't mean to mock the Bible. They just wanted to tell the story of an ordinary man, Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman), who just happened to live in that period. It's an enjoyable satire on everyday life, both Jewish and Roman (or Woman, as Michael Palin would say), in 33 AD Judea.The movie has so many memorable gags and characters it's impossible to list all of them: my personal favorites are Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) with his speaking defect (see the Woman part) and his friend Biggus Dickus (Chapman again), the PFJ led by John Cleese's Reg, and of course the immortal ending, which I won't and can't reveal, but I assure you: rarely has a comedy had such a brilliant, original conclusion. It's in the same league as Some Like it Hot's 'Well, nobody's perfect!'.So, I really hope you'll have a good time with Britain's best comedians. I sure did.Oh, by the way: always look on the bright side of life...",10,5,12,22 January 2006
Se7en," One of the scariest, nastiest thrillers ever filmed - makes The Silence of the Lambs look like a children's movie!
","1991: Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five Oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: David Fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated Alien 3, unleashes Se7en. The latter wins no Academy Awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of Fincher's vision it actually manages to make Demme's work seem rather tame. So uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, Se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match.Ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. It sure as hell upsets William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. Helping him with the investigation is the edgy David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). Unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: John Doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it.What distances Se7en from most Hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, Fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. As repulsive as they may look, Doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for).The unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, Freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to Pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with Fincher, the splendid Fight Club). But it is Kevin Spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his Oscar-winning turn in The Usual Suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. He may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was Anthony Hopkins when he played Hannibal Lecter for the first time. The difference is, John Doe is so merciless and sadistic even Lecter would probably be afraid of running into him.In the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. But those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in Hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless.",10,1,2,17 May 2007
I'm Not There," He may not be there as a character, but Dylan's spirit permeates Todd Haynes' anti-biography
","Ray Charles? No problem at all. Johnny Cash? Ditto. Bob Dylan? Don't think so. For all his brilliance and deep influence on 20th-century culture, Dylan is so elusive and enigmatic an icon no one has ever tried to make a film about his life. Even Martin Scorsese, who delivered the ultimate tribute, the beautiful documentary No Direction Home, was wise enough to focus on what inspired Dylan rather than the man himself. So why would the great musician sanction Todd Haynes' experimental take on his life? The answer's very simple: he ain't really there.The key to understanding I'm Not There is in the opening credits, where a caption declares the film is 'based on the music and many lives of Bob Dylan'. By having six protagonists, all of whom embody an aspect of the singer without actually being named after him, Haynes can cover whatever aspect of Dylan's persona he pleases without upsetting anyone. After all, the subject isn't even there.So who is there? Well, there's a young African-American boy named Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin) who travels around the South of the USA and is influenced by the people he runs into; there's Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), a 22-year old folk artist who is embracing early successes; Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), an actor playing Rollins on screen who is watching his marriage fall apart; Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), who represents the so-called 'sell-out' period in which Robert Zimmerman went commercial; Billy the Kid (Richard Gere), an outlaw living in an elegiac landscape and about to witness the end of his era; and the mysterious Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Whishaw), who is shown as he gets questioned at a trial and throws out the occasional piece of philosophy, speaking lines such as 'I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me.'.Six different incarnations: they're all Dylan, and yet they aren't, which is probably the point. When an artist is that complex, the best thing to do is rejecting all thoughts of conventional storytelling: with no trace of chronology or even coherence between the different sections (minus the Bale-Ledger connection), Haynes' peculiar picture is more about mood, music and images than a traditional story. Fans of Sam Peckinpah, in particular, are likely to adore the Gere chapter, which explicitly references the Dylan-scored Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (coincidentally, Peckinpah's Billy, Kris Kristofferson, is the narrator in this film). 'Knocking on Heaven's Door', however, is not included.With all the focus on style, one might think the cast if of secondary importance. That couldn't be further from the truth: from Franklin's passionate 'rookie' to Whishaw's unsettling oddball, all six 'Dylans' contribute to conveying the brilliant poet's secretive charisma. Most effective of all is Blanchett: not only is the physical resemblance faultless; her androgynous performance captures Dylan's contradictory charm better than all her co-stars put together, which is why she won the Best Actress award (or should it have been Actor?) in Venice, collected a Golden Globe and will, hopefully, get another Oscar, after her stunning effort in The Aviator.Bottom line: the movie is very good-looking, wonderfully scored and boasts incredibly strong acting. But is it for everyone? Not really. Those who aren't particularly familiar with Dylan's work will struggle to understand what all the fuss is about, but if they hold on until the end they might be able to appreciate Haynes' creation: a free-wheeling, strangely gripping portrait of a genius. Despite the fact that he isn't actually in it.",9,1,2,15 January 2008
The Big Lebowski," Keep'em coming, Dude!
","If Fargo is the highest point in the Coen brothers' filmography, The Big Lebowski comes in a close second: it's a perfect hybrid of fun, mystery, irony and pure insanity, Joel and Ethan's most explicitly entertaining movie since Raising Arizona, and by far more accomplished.The plot, loosely based on Raymond Chandler's works (the title itself is an obvious pastiche of The Big Sleep), revolves around a former hippie, Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who insists everyone refer to him as The Dude or, in extreme cases, something like His Dudeness or El Duderino. To call The Dude an underachiever is a euphemism: he's never achieved anything, in fact he spends his days doing nothing besides smoking marijuana, drinking White Russians or bowling with his 'friends' Walter (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran with a life philosophy like no one else, and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), who isn't actually allowed to do much since everyone constantly asks him to 'shut the f*ck up' (whereas in Fargo it was impossible to prevent him from talking).The Dude's quiet existence is radically shaken up when he is assaulted for no reason by two men who even take the liberty of peeing on his rug. As it turns out, they mistook him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, the one mentioned in the title, a wheelchair-bound millionaire whose young wife (Tara Reid) appears to have been kidnapped by a band of Nihilists (led by Peter Stormare). Add a sleazy pornographer (Ben Gazzara), the other Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliott) whose voice occasionally comments on the story, a child-molesting bowling champion (John Turturro) named Jesus ('That's right! Nobody f*cks with the Jesus!'), some freaky dream sequences and several mix-ups and it's no longer very surprising that The Dude needs absurd quantities of booze and pot to accept what's happening to him.As a matter of fact, what happens is actually the least interesting aspect of the film: the noirish premise is nothing but a MacGuffin, a cheap yet brilliant excuse to make all those wonderful characters interact with the Coens' trademark exquisite dialogue, the best lines coming out of Goodman's mouth ('This is what happens when you f*ck a stranger in the ass!'). The fine ensemble cast gives life to a singular group of pederasts, pimps, private investigators and slackers, above whom Bridges towers with a humanity that makes you want to hug him on the spot. The Dude, a revolutionary at heart even when there seems to be nothing left to fight for, is the brothers' most relatable and endearing creation next to Fargo's Marge Gunderson, and it's no surprise: in the twisted Coeniverse, they're as normal as they come.Overall, pretty much a modern classic, like most of the Coens' films, and, despite its dark streak, a bit of a feel-good movie, thanks to its oddly sweet and charming protagonist. As The Stranger points out: 'It's good knowing he's out there, The Dude.'",10,1,2,15 August 2008
Unbreakable," Shyamalan's masterpiece
","You're a young director, and you have just hit it big with an intelligent thriller called The Sixth Sense. What's your next move? An intelligent... comic-book movie? For many other filmmakers, such a gamble could have marked the end of their career; in the case of M. Night Shyamalan, it became the best film he's made to this point.Following the old 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' rule, Shyamalan teams up with Bruce Willis again, and for the second consecutive time Willis plays a more subdued role compared to his signature films (no 'yippee-ki-yay' moments here). His character is a security guard named David Dunn. He's an ordinary man who used to play football in high school but had to quit because of an injury. One day, he is on a train that accidentally derails, resulting in the death of all passengers but him. On top of being the only survivor, he doesn't have a single scratch on his body. No one is able to explain that, and David tries to get back to a normal life, until he runs into a wheelchair-bound comic-book fan, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), also known as Mr. Glass since he suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that makes his bones much more fragile than those of a normal human being. Elijah is convinced David is some kind of superhero, and sets out to prove it by asking a series of questions, the most important of which is: 'How many days of your life have you been sick?'.Unbreakable does the impossible of turning a potentially geeky subject into a serious movie - with a limited budget. There are no special effects or overly weird events, meaning all Shyamalan has to tell his story is a suitable mood, James Newton Howard's music and the priceless Willis-Jackson double act. Jackson, in particular, is a bit of a revelation in a part that's miles away form his signature cool performances à la Pulp Fiction: he's brooding, intense and occasionally scary - just what's needed to make the film work. Willis, on the other hand, succeeds in conveying the humanity of a character who might not even be human.Sure, the film is low-key and a bit slow at times, something most viewers might not like in this kind of film. Those who liked The Sixth Sense, though, will be happy to know that the director has topped himself, and the slow pace is worth putting up with in light of the epilogue, which is Unbreakable's very reason to exist. To all viewers who claimed the twist in The Sixth Sense was obvious: you won't see this one coming. Exceptional 9,5/10",10,0,0,16 June 2008
Star Trek," Here's to the new generation!
","As far as reboots go, the new Star Trek picture was always going to be a tough one to pull off, and not just because of the famous 'odd-numbered curse' (this being, technically speaking, the eleventh Trek movie): unlike other recently regenerated franchises like Batman or James Bond, Gene Roddenberry's creation is burdened with a somewhat cheesy reputation, mostly due to William Shatner's iconic line delivery (very... long... dramatic pauses) and fans (or Trekkers, as they call themselves) who have a habit of trying to learn the Klingon language. It is therefore understandable that Paramount handed the damaged franchise (the previous film, Star Trek: Nemesis, while not being the worst of the lot, was the least successful commercially) to a non-fan: J.J. Abrams, whose untarnished TV record (Alias and Lost) and previous successful 'redemption operation' (Mission: Impossible III) make him an ideal candidate for bringing Star Trek to a new, disillusioned generation of viewers. And boy, does he deliver...Kicking off with a huge space battle, Abrams' prequel/reboot then proceeds to show us the difficult upbringing of the original show's leading duo: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), a hot-headed, womanizing rebel whose father was killed in the aforementioned battle, and Spock (Zachary Quinto), the Vulcan scientist who has to deal with the 'shame' of having a human mother (Winona Ryder). The two meet (and clash) at Starfleet Academy, and later find themselves on the U.S.S. Enterprise alongside 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Their mission: to prevent the vengeful Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan who has come from the future, to carry out his evil plan.A simple story on paper, but with a few surprises along the way: that's what Abrams and his screenwriters, self-confessed Trek aficionados Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, offer the audience over the course of 126 minutes. There's humor, action, suspense, romance (though not the one suggested in pre-release rumors), some technobabble (this is Star Trek, after all): in short, a fun, exciting ride that will please old and new fans alike. For the latter category, there's the classic good story well told, decorated with some nice explosions, space travel at incredible speed (one really gets the feeling of traveling faster than light) and a few bona fide fights (not to mention a tormented protagonist who's more Luke Skywalker than William Shatner); for the die-hard Trekkers, there are the characters who retain their original characteristics while inheriting some new traits from the actors playing them (best of the lot are Quinto's Spock, Urban's McCoy and Simon Pegg's Scotty), a villain worth comparing to Khan and knowing references to the original series, which range from deliberate tributes (the classic theme music and 'final frontier' monologue, the late Majel Barrett - that would be Roddenberry's widow - voicing the Enterprise's computer) to clever, and occasionally ironic, in-jokes (how McCoy got his nickname, the Kobayashi Maru test, Sulu's passion for fencing).Still, this isn't just a prequel story, it's also a reboot, meaning Abrams must have some trick up his sleeve that will allow him to take the story in a new direction come sequel(s) time. He does, and it's a brilliant idea he and the writers have come up with: through his time-trotting actions, Nero has permanently altered the Trek reality we knew and erased the events of at least ten episodes (including the original rejected pilot The Cage, whose lead character Christopher Pike has an important role in the film), which means encyclopedic knowledge of TOS is no longer a prerequisite for future installments.But angered Trekkers needn't worry: there's still a vital, unbreakable link with the original show, namely Leonard Nimoy, who takes advantage of the time travel gimmick to play the 'real' Spock once again and truly pass the torch to the new cast, acting as a bridge between the two separate continuities and ensuring the old Trek universe will never die, despite what the destruction of a '60s car early into the film might symbolically suggest. Some will probably claim The Wrath of Khan remains the best entry in the franchise, but it is undeniable that thanks to Abrams and his 'partners in crime', Roddenberry's creation really gets to go where no Star Trek film has gone before. May the new version live long, and prosper",9,3,11,10 May 2009
Fight Club," Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to Fight Club...
","There is a huge misconception regarding this movie: a superficial plot summary will dismiss it as a hyper-violent thriller with fascist undertones (in fact, Roger Ebert called it 'the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish'). Some even refer to it as a '90s version of Kubrick's masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, with added blood. Such descriptions are very reductive and misleading.It may be very violent at times (the most gruesome bits make Scorsese's movies look rather tame), that's undeniable, but Fight Club is much more than that. Its complex, non-linear and fascinating script (based on the eponymous cult novel) deals with revolution, madness, and yes, fascism on a certain level, and the film's greatness lies in how David Fincher, who had already shown his edgy talent on Se7en and is at the top of his game here, combines those themes to comment on our society. That's right, beneath the gore and anarchic atmosphere lies a carefully constructed, though not very subtle, satire on consumerism (as Brad Pitt's character puts it: 'Advertising has us chasing sports cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need').The film stars Edward Norton as a nameless, bored, insomniac office geek who's trying to find a meaning for his life. In order to do this he starts attending various support groups, even though he has none of the diseases (testicular cancer among them) dealt with in those groups.This is when he meets Marla Singer (an almost unrecognizable Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who fakes as much as he does, and accuses her of messing up his life. The real mess, however, starts when the Narrator runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): this guy claims to be a simple soap producer and salesman, but in reality he's a rebel, a psychopath who thinks people truly know themselves only after they have been in a fight. Together, the two create Fight Club, an illegal association where frustrated men in their thirties can unleash all their suppressed rage, as long as they follow some simple rules (as a matter of fact, writing this review constitutes a violation of the first two). But as everyone knows, violence creates more violence, and soon enough what started as an unusual way to deal with boredom becomes an increasingly dangerous game of manipulation and destruction.Said manipulation suits Fincher well, the dark, bizarrely funny universe he has created serving as a tool to reflect not only on the changing society, but also on film itself as an art-form. While the characters break the rules on screen, the director breaks them on his own work, frequently exposing the fictional nature of what is being shown (the characters address the audience directly, a pornographic frame Tyler inserts in a family movie pops up in the actual film). In the middle of this controlled chaos, Fincher can rely on a marvelous cast: Norton is mesmerizing, seamlessly moving from total apathy to fearful awareness; Bonham Carter still has to find a role as demanding, compelling and rewarding as Marla; as for Brad Pitt, he shamelessly steals the show from start to finish, perfecting the edge he had started to develop in Se7en and giving us his best performance ever. Incendiary and effortlessly cool, his only real turn as a villain is a mix of style, darkness and charisma that has been missing in every character he has played since..An absolute masterpiece, albeit one that demands at least a second viewing before it can be completely understood and embraced, Fight Club is one of the greatest movies of the '90s, perhaps even THE best of the entire decade.Totally unmissable",10,2,5,14 September 2005
As Good as It Gets," As good as romantic comedies usually get? No, better!
","Hollywood has forgotten how to do rom-coms properly nowadays. With a few exceptions (e.g. Hitch), they're all so predictable and awfully repetitive. Lucky for us, As Good as It Gets is not one of those films. It's smart, it's original and it's also very, very funny.The movie begins with the now legendary sequence where misanthropic writer Melvin Udall (a priceless Jack Nicholson) dumps his neighbor's dog, Verdell, down the garbage chute, telling the poor creature 'This is New York, pal. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere!'. This hilarious opening scene perfectly serves its purpose: to make it undeniably clear that Melvin is one of the most unpleasant individuals in the world. Apart from the dog thing, he spends his days avoiding people or insulting them. Not the kind of behavior you'd expect from a guy who writes romance novels, huh? Anyway, things change once Verdell's owner, gay artist Simon (Greg Kinnear) ends up at the hospital. From there on, it's up to Melvin to make sure the dog's fine, and on top of that, our antihero starts developing feelings for Carol (Helen Hunt), a single mom who works in the coffee shop he has breakfast at every morning. These unexpected feelings, which he has only known about through his literary works so far, are going to transform his life forever...As Good as It Gets has a concept which reminds of When Harry Met Sally: put two people, who would never go out together under the normal circumstances, in the same room (not literally, though) and see what happens. In this case, however, the story is made more interesting by the fact that its male protagonist is supposed to be beyond redemption. And Jack Nicholson does a wonderful job in making that man's craziness believable, but then again it's the kind of role he can handle with his eyes shut, isn't it? Hunt is also amazing, giving a career-best performance which was justly praised with a Best Actress Oscar, while Jack won his third 'golden baldy' thanks to James L. Brooks'(yes, it's the director of Terms Of Endearment and executive producer of The Simpsons) charming film.So, is this movie as good as it gets? Considering the direction romantic comedy has taken in the past few years, I'd say it's better.",9,1,1,14 March 2006
Memento," The Ultimate Mind-twister
","There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction are two good examples). Memento deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement I've seen in a while. Thought The Matrix was confusing? Think again. Memento looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until it fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). The problem? Because of an accident, 'Lenny' has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, 'Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself ('You don't even know who you are!' 'I'm Leonard Shelby. I'm from San Francisco.' 'That's who you were! Not who you have become!')? Writer/director Christopher Nolan knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines ('How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?'); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.For those uninitiated to Nolan's genius, Memento is the perfect way to start. For fans: watch it alongside Batman Begins and you'll experience an amazing day in your life.",10,0,3,15 December 2005
Inglourious Basterds," War is hell... and a lot of fun too, apparently!
","For years, Inglourious Basterds was one of those films many aficionados had heard of, but never actually hoped to see: originally conceived at around the same time as Pulp Fiction, it was postponed twice when Kill Bill and Grindhouse got in the way (three times if you count the kung fu movie QT announced in late 2004 and has made no further comments about thus far). Additionally, so many rumors started circulating, be it about the script's scope (Tarantino reportedly considered making two movies, or even a TV miniseries) or the casting (at one stage or another, the film was going to star - according to various rumors - Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy and the dream team of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that it was safe to assume Basterds would be just another promise the director just couldn't find the time to keep. Then, all of a sudden, there it was: script completed in the summer of 2008, green-lit in record time so that Tarantino could meet the Cannes deadline and released in theaters three months after its prestigious French premiere in a 'retooled' version (it's actually just a minute longer than the cut shown in Cannes). Was it worth the wait and speculation? As ever with QT, the answer is a resounding 'Hell, yes!'.Starting very boldly with a 20-minute conversation between two people (a scene that reminds of the Sicilian bit in True Romance, a parallel Tarantino himself also acknowledges), the film then sets out to introduce its first main plot: the story of a French Jewish girl, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), who manages to escape while her entire family has been slaughtered and vows revenge on all Nazis, ideally represented by the suave but cruel Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Her story intersects with that of the Basterds, a team of Jewish-American soldiers (played by the likes of Eli Roth, The Office's B.J. Novak and Freaks and Geeks' Samm Levine) under the command of Tennessee-born Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their mission? To go to France and kill (and scalp) as many Nazis as possible, with some help of the British (cue the presence of Michael Fassbender, whose real- life first language is, ironically enough, German). Needless to say, Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) isn't very happy to hear about this.Although it takes its title (sort of) from a cult film by Italian director Enzo G. Castellari, called Inglorious Bastards in the US (the proper translation of the Italian title, Quel maledetto treno blindato, would have been That Damned Armored Train), Tarantino's new opus isn't a remake. Heck, it's not even really a war movie, just like Kill Bill isn't really a revenge flick. Sure, it's set 'once upon a time in Nazi-occupied France', as the title of the first chapter (there are five of them) informs us, and it's about American soldiers fighting against Nazis, but the joy of the movie lies in watching the director take all war movie conventions and do whatever the hell he likes with them.Nothing in Inglourious Basterds looks or sounds conventional: for one thing, the titular characters don't appear at all in two chapters, and Raine, the alleged protagonist, is the Basterd with the least screen-time. Furthermore, the director favors long dialogue scenes (the spectacular opening, of course, as well as the La Louisiane section) over action, although the latter is pretty visceral when it shows up: blood, dismemberment and a cheeky comment about Donny Donowitz's (Roth, in a surprisingly good role) habit of beating the enemy to death with a baseball bat being the closest these guys get to going to the movies. That thin line between absolute horror and pitch-black humor is best exemplified by the Landa character, a creation so astounding Tarantino has said he wouldn't have made the movie if he hadn't found the right actor. Fortunately he found the Austrian Waltz, who justly won the Best Actor award in Cannes and deserves several more for his chilling yet immensely entertaining portrayal of a man capable of delivering eloquent speeches in four different languages (another bold move on the director's part: half of the film is subtitled) and coldly murdering innocent people with the same ease. If you put him and Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction in the same room, it would be one hell of a battle of wits.And what about QT's blatant love for all kinds of cinema? It's there, perhaps even more prominently than ever before: the soundtrack pays countless homages to Ennio Morricone, who was meant to score the film at one point (the tribute includes a highly ironic use of Morricone's theme from The Battle of Algiers, whose documentary-like realism is the polar opposite of Tarantino's many deliberate excesses), most of the characters' names (most notably Mike Myers' hilarious Ed Fenech) are based on revered B-movie stars (what else?), Brad Pitt is obviously goofing around with his celebrity image, and the entire, outrageous final chapter takes place in a movie theater (plus the comment about Donowitz earlier on). Additionally, Tarantino has inserted a couple of clever in-jokes at the expense of his own universe, with a discussion about the principles of a Mexican stand-off (which occurs during an actual stand-off), scenes that mirror similar ones from his previous films and vocal cameos by people like Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel.Sure, some might object to the joyously OTT nature of the whole thing, not least the final line which will certainly be used by detractors to prove that Tarantino is just a self-centered, cocky geek. That may be the case, but given Inglourious Basterds is a shamelessly and intelligently entertaining piece of cinema, not to mention QT's funniest and most accomplished work since Pulp Fiction, that kind of conclusion is the perfect icing on a delicious cake that true fans will want to eat over and over again.",10,3,11,16 September 2009
Iron Man 2," Tony's back!
","In terms of expectations, Iron Man 2 started as a quite different beast compared to its predecessor. After all, the first film was 'burdened' by a protagonist without the mainstream appeal of, say, Spider-Man, a director better known as a character actor (Jon Favreau) and a leading man whose career has been shaky to say the least (Robert Downey Jr.). As it turned out, Iron Man was just what movie audiences needed, becoming a surprise hit, cementing Downey Jr. and Favreau's reputations as go-to guys in the industry (with the former winning a Golden Globe for Sherlock Holmes and the latter hired to direct another comic-book picture, Cowboys and Aliens) and kick-starting a new on-screen Marvel Universe, no longer limited by the issue of rights belonging to different studios (with the exception of pre-established franchises like X-Men and Spider-Man, characters are now freely allowed to cross over, just like in the comics). How do you follow that? With a sequel that retains the same spirit, but goes further in terms of scope and ambition.Set six months after the conclusion of the first film, Iron Man 2 shows Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) in a tight spot: since he came clean about his double identity, his fame has reached sky-high proportions, but with the consequence that the US government (here embodied by Garry Shandling's annoying Congressman) wants the Iron Man suit for themselves. Additionally, the very thing keeping him alive - the arc reactor that has effectively replaced his biological heart - is slowly killing him (radiation poisoning), and two very different bad guys - business rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and former engineer-turned-supervillain Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) - are planning ways to get rid of him permanently. Lucky for him, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard) and new secretary 'Natalie' (Scarlett Johansson) are willing to help, assuming Tony doesn't destroy himself in the process...Sequels are tricky by definition, and Iron Man 2 is a particularly tough one to pull off since it not only has to satisfy as a standalone follow-up (however paradoxical that may sound), but also set up events for the other movies that will make up the expanded Marvel movie universe. It all started with Samuel L. Jackson's cameo in the first movie's post-credits scene (followed by Downey Jr. making an appearance in The Incredible Hulk a month later), and this time the actor is allowed more screen-time - heck, he even gets his name in the opening credits - to do his usual stuff and set up The Avengers (plus minor hints at Thor and Captain America) in an intriguing way, without ever giving the impression that he's stealing someone else's movie.And that's the real key behind Iron Man 2's success: it is an Iron Man flick, retaining the original's winning combination of action and humor, thanks to Justin Theroux's witty script and Favreau's effortless direction. Like most sequels, it goes dark in places, but this isn't Nolan's Batman, meaning that a lighter mood generally prevails (see the alcoholism subplot). Like the first film, the follow-up is a bit of a let-down when it comes to the climactic showdown (again, way too long), but otherwise it delivers everything it promised: the special effects are flawless (Exhibit A: the Monte Carlo race track sequence), the laughs and thrills are evenly balanced and everyone in the cast is fully game, from Rockwell and Rourke's riotous double act to Cheadle easily filling Howard's shoes, not to mention some welcome extra material for the director himself, who gets to be as funny as ever in the always entertaining company of Johansson. As usual, though, this is Downey's show from start to finish, and he slips into Stark's skin so perfectly it's damn near impossible not to raise expectations for the next installment.Bottom line: as a piece in Marvel's expanding cinematic world, Iron Man 2 is as satisfying as one could anticipate. As its own thing, it's a fun, energetic follow-up that confirms the charm of comic-book movies and, much like its printed counterpart, leaves the door open for endless new possibilities. In other words: bring on number three...",8,1,2,23 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," In space, no one can hear you scream...
","... in rage! Alien 3 was supposed to end the saga, but since they wanted to make more money, Fox decided to make another sequel. Only problem: how were they going to do it? As you may remember, David Fincher's underrated third installment ended with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) sacrificing herself to put an end to the alien threat for ever. As there can't be an Alien film without Weaver (and those who have seen Alien vs. Predator know it), something had to be done to bring her back convincingly. Hence Alien: Resurrection.Taking place 200 years after the events of the third film, Resurrection solves the death issue in the most original way: cloning. That's right, the movie opens with a group of scientists finally succeeding, after seven disastrous attempts, in creating a perfect copy of Ripley. While the people involved in the experiment are thrilled, the crew of the Betty (a spaceship that stopped by for supplies) are not as excited. It does not take long to figure out why: the scientists' real purpose was to revive the Alien Queen that was inside Ripley at the time of her death, and use the offspring as biological weapons. And when the creatures start spreading terror and death, everyone realizes that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.To be fair, the premise was not that bad: the idea of a cloned Ripley and the conspiracy regarding the aliens could have been awesome, if used correctly. Which is something neither writer Joss Whedon (who usually is a terrific storyteller, as Buffy and Angel prove) nor director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (yes, the same guy who did a masterwork like Amélie) know how to do. While the production design is superb and the special effects are generally good (with the exception of the hideous 'Newborn' alien), the suspense and claustrophobia that made the first three movies unique are gone. What was meant to be a blend of sci-fi and horror is turned into a straight-out action flick, complete with loud guns, lame dialogue (maybe Whedon was suffering from writer's block in that period) and lousy characterizations: apart from Weaver, who does her usual job with finesse, and Ron Perlman, who plays a rude-yet-charismatic scumbag, no one is able to add something extra to a bunch of disposable, two-dimensional stereotypes, not even a clearly miscast Winona Ryder, who seems to have lost all the charm and intensity she had in the likes of Heathers and Edward Scissorhands.Once again, the law of diminishing returns has been confirmed: aside from a few inspired moments early into the film, Alien: Resurrection is the most disappointing movie in the series. While Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher's contributions knew what they were aiming at and hit the target, Jeunet's franchise-closer doesn't even know where to aim.5,5/10",6,1,1,16 May 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Sex, Lies and Rock Stars
","In the expanded Judd Apatow universe, Jason Segel has always had the role of the oddball character, be it on TV in Freaks and Geeks or, later on, Undeclared, or in Apatow's directorial effort Knocked Up. Now, following the lead of former co-star Seth Rogen, he takes his stab at starring in a picture, with an additional, significant contribution in the form of the screenplay (with Apatow producing, of course). And despite the implications of the title, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a more than decent effort.Segel plays Peter Bretter, a TV composer who gets unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, small-screen star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell in slightly self-spoofing mode) while in the buff. As per the recommendation of his brother (Bill Hader), he goes to Hawaii on a little trip to find happiness again. And it all seems to go well, what with the company of hotel employees Rachel (Mila Kunis) and Matthew (Jonah Hill) and surfing instructor Chuck (Paul Rudd). However, one big problem has to be dealt with: Sarah is also there, with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)...Sticking close to the Apatow template (hence the presence of regular players Rudd, Hill and Hader), Forgetting Sarah Marshall attempts to deftly mix sweeter material and rude comedy. The former comes in the form of Peter's very real and affecting relationship with Rachel; the latter is best embodied by Segel's infamous full frontal nude scenes (based on real events, apparently). The balance works quite well but is somewhat disturbed by Segel and director Nicholas Stoller's show business-satirizing agenda. Some ideas (the Seinfeld reference, a Dracula musical with puppets) work brilliantly, others - including the titular character - fall a bit flat.The lead performances are equally uneven: though he lacks the weird charm of Seth Rogen, Segel is a likable protagonist; Bell, on the other hand, is stuck with a very clichéd character and isn't able to elevate her above a basic starlet caricature. The supporting cast is, fortunately, up to the challenge and effectively lifts up the movie. Best of the bunch is Brand, also in a vaguely autobiographical zone as a British rock star with various addictions. Profane, honest and hilarious, it's no wonder he got his own movie recently.In short, Forgetting Sarah Marshall isn't exactly the best of the Apatow bunch, but it's got solid laughs, an ace soundtrack and, for better or worse, Jason Segel's penis. Oh, and did I mention the Dracula puppet musical? 7,5/10",8,0,2,19 January 2011
12 Monkeys," Excellent dark sci-fi
","I knew Terry Gilliam's movies were all but predictable, but I had to see Twelve Monkeys in order to truly believe it.This is the only Gilliam movie I've seen so far, but it blew me away so much he's already one of my favorite filmmakers.The story may seem a little bit classic(a man is sent back in time to stop a disaster), but Gilliam immediately makes it original:convict James Cole(Bruce Willis) ends up a few years before the plague breaks loose, so no one believes him and he's locked up in an asylum.He has to convince Dr.Railly(Madeleine Stowe)he's not crazy, while he spends his time with 'fellow' nut-case Jeffrey Goines(Brad Pitt).The Twelve Monkeys have to be stopped...If you thought you knew what dark sci-fi flicks are like, think again.In terms of atmosphere, this is a perfect mix of Blade Runner and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest(the asylum riot is visually great). The script is incredibly good, and the same is to be said about the performances:Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt are amazing(the latter was Oscar-nominated for this role), playing two guys they wouldn't be associated with under the normal circumstances.But when we're talking about Terry Gilliam, can there actually be any normal circumstances?",10,4,5,8 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Jack's back... Yo ho!!!!!
","Ah, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a wonderful film. It successfully resurrected the swashbuckler genre, became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2003 and received five Oscar nominations, including, for the first time, Best Actor for Johnny Depp (apparently, the Academy didn't notice three previous gems such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco), who turned from indie poster-boy to Hollywood superstar. Oh yes, POTC was a great movie. And now the pirates have returned, bigger, but not always better, than ever!This time, everybody's in trouble. Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) wedding day is ruined by the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a very unpleasant man who's been sent to arrest them for helping the notorious pirate Jack Sparrow, I'm sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow, escape from hanging. The couple's only chance to get a full pardon is to steal Jack's compass, which will lead Becket to the Dead Man's Chest, an object that gives its owner the power to control the sea. Jack (Johnny Depp), on the other hand, has gotten himself in an even worse situation. You see, in order to become captain of the Black Pearl, he made a deal with the demonic Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Now, thirteen years later, the Scottish pirate wants Jack to pay his debt, meaning our hero is supposed to serve on ghost-vessel The Flying Dutchman for 100 years. Unless Jack can get out of this mess, of course. Hence the need to retrieve the aforementioned chest...Now, let's be honest. Pirates didn't need a sequel, since everything ended so perfectly and everyone got what he/she wanted. But who cares, when the continuation is, for the most part, a fun ride? Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio have returned to familiar territory and expanded the mythology, creating a fascinating world which fuses elements of Indiana Jones and Star Wars (DMC has plenty of references to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, not to mention a threesome sword-fight that will make The Phantom Menace eat its heart out). And while they introduce new locations (a stunning cannibal island) and new threats (the half squid, half crab Jones, his 'fishy' crew and his pet sea monster, the Kraken), they don't forget our old friends on the way. Supporting characters such as Commodore Norrington and the comic duo Pintel & Ragetti are given more space, while the protagonists carry the story without disappointing us. Will is still an honorable man, driven by love towards his fiancée and forced to deal with his father, 'Bootstrap' Bill (a very human Stellan Skarsgård), who turns out to be not only alive, but also a member of Davy Jones' crew. Elizabeth still seeks adventure as well as a peaceful life with her man. The pirates are still a bunch of stinking rascals, and Jack... well, he's Jack! Constantly unreliable but charismatic, he steals the entire movie with no effort at all (although he has less screen-time than expected). From the moment he first shows up, you know you're in for something absolutely unforgettable. His performance is zany and brilliant enough to make the very long running time (two and a half hours) and occasional far-fetched twists seem less irritating than they should be. If you loved the first movie, you just can't miss Dead Man's Chest. It may not be as fresh and well-crafted as its predecessor, but it is a good piece of entertainment and should raise expectations regarding the upcoming number 3.6,5/10",7,4,9,17 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Terrific!
","You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.The opening concept is a clichè:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy('You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of' 'But you HAVE heard of me!').It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.See you next summer,Captain!",9,151,185,29 September 2005
Hostel," Hardly a horror classic, but recommended for its twisted concept
","This film's advertising insisted on the fact that it was 'the sickest, bloodiest movie you'll ever see', as opposed to all the tame, PG-13-rated horror films (most of them being remakes of Japanese shockers) that were being released at the time. According to writer/director Eli Roth, it was time the horror genre got its guts back (both metaphorically and literally). As for that second statement, there's no reason to argue: Hostel is not a film teenagers or the weak of stomach should see. When it comes to the 'sickest, bloodiest' part, however, it's a whole different story.At first, casual viewers might think they're watching the wrong movie: the film opens with three backpackers coming to Amsterdam. Why they have chosen Amsterdam is quite obvious: what better place if you're looking for sex and drugs? As one of the three, the Icelandic, self-proclaimed 'King of the Swing' Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), would say, 'It's f*cking awesome!'. Apparently, though, there's this village outside of Bratislava, in Slovakia, where the girls are even hotter, and particularly willing to sleep with Americans, something that makes Oli's mates, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), very eager to try this new place. What seemed to be another version of Eurotrip, however, will soon become a nightmare, as our three unsuspecting protagonists run into something so terrifying few people would be able to imagine it. And this is where the massacre begins. Well, not quite actually.In fact, despite what he promised, Roth doesn't exactly show us everything: we rarely see the acts themselves (which include severed limbs and eyeball torture), as the director thinks the effects of those acts will be scary enough. And as a matter of fact, they are, although it has got more to do with the context Roth has come up with for all that violence. On an entirely conceptual level, Hostel is absolutely brilliant, with a third-act twist so nasty it will make the audience re-evaluate the whole film (a small clue for genre fans: it kind of reminds of The Wicker Man, which is referenced in a sex scene). Shame the director doesn't develop this great idea in a particularly original way, using it merely as an excuse to show us flesh (first half of the movie) and blood (second half), and neither of them in the excessive amount the trailers and posters seemed to promise. Roth certainly knows where to place the camera when filming the most gruesome sequences, but he lacks the genius of filmmakers like Tarantino (who is one of Hostel's executive producers) or Takashi Miike (who appears briefly).Ultimately, Hostel deserves to be seen because of its original concept, although the rest is fairly conventional, and not as extreme and disgusting as they want to make you think.",7,1,1,13 March 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A very promising beginning
","Before Harry Potter made his appearance, there was another fantasy series people (not just children) all over the world loved, and still love: The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.Lewis. Now the saga has been successfully transferred to the screen (an attempt had already been made on TV in 1988-1990, but the result, while faithful to the book, was rather annoying).Based on the first volume in the series (it's actually the second if you follow the suggested reading order, but the first Lewis wrote), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe tells the story of the four Pevensie siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, who have to leave their home in London during WWII and live in Professor Kirke's (Jim Broadbent) huge mansion. It is there that they find the titular piece of furniture, which will lead them to Narnia, a magical world inhabited by all kinds of creatures: talking animals, fauns, centaurs, and of course the great lion, creator and king of Narnia, Aslan himself (voiced by Liam Neeson), who reveals to the children their arrival has been foretold and anticipated for years, as they're supposed to help him defeat the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire enchanted world with an everlasting winter. It's all gonna be a huge adventure, part Harry Potter (the kids who are introduced to another world and find out they are 'chosen ones'), part Lord of the Rings (the epic battle between good and evil).Okay, let's calm down with the 'epic battle' bit. As visually mesmerizing as it may be, it suffers from the camera being a little prudish and looking away in the crucial moments. After all, we're talking about a PG feature, but come on: we're in the 21st century and this is actually the darkest opus in the saga (alongside The Silver Chair). They have even added a sequence which wasn't in the book to make the story more dramatic.That said, this wonderful movie doesn't seem to have any significant flaws, except the fact that some of the CGI wolves look a little bit too fake. The other beasts, however, look fine, and their voices are provided by a bunch of talented people: Ray Winstone's Mr.Beaver (and spouse) perfectly serves his purpose as the funny sidekick and Rupert Everett's turn as Fox makes it pretty clear why said animal is the symbol of unreliability, while Neeson's Aslan is the wise and kind mentor/father figure, in the same league as Richard Harris'Dumbledore and Ian McKellen's Gandalf. On the human side, Swinton is the standout as usual, proving you don't need excessive make-up to be a threatening presence. She is a very worthy villain for this film. The kids are good too, the quality of their acting increasing as the story goes on (lucky for us the movie was shot in chronological order).As for the Christian subtext everyone's been talking about, it is present but you don't have to interpret the film that way if you don't want to. Just consider it a hugely exciting fantasy outing and you'll be satisfied.So, after this remarkable experience, will the other six books be turned into movies as well? To paraphrase Professor Kirke, keep your eyes open...",8,2,3,28 December 2005
Elizabeth," Queen Blanchett
","The Academy Awards ceremony of 1999 angered many people: Shakespeare in Love, albeit a very smart and funny film, robbed the superior Saving Private Ryan of the Best Picture Oscar; Roberto Benigni beat Edward Norton in the Best Actor category (though it was the Italian star's behavior, rather than his performance, that irritated those attending the event); and Gwyneth Paltrow, who wasn't actually bad in Shakespeare, walked away with the Best Actress award, depriving Cate Blanchett of the recognition she should have received for her revelatory work in Elizabeth.This film, the first in what the director hopes will be a trilogy (the second installment was released in 2007), covers the early years of Elizabeth I's reign, from her harsh upbringing to the decision to call herself 'the Virgin Queen'. To describe her situation as tough is an understatement: she was a Protestant monarch in a largely Catholic kingdom, several covert groups wanted her dead and foreign sovereigns kept asking for her hand in marriage, without ever succeeding, for the only man she loved was also the only one she couldn't have.Conspiracies and unhappy romances: two unusual ingredients for a period drama. And that is exactly why the film succeeds: in the mind of director Shekhar Kapur, this is not the usual costume film where events are observed with a static eye and what might be perceived by some as excessive slowness (Quentin Tarantino's infamous rant about 'Merchant-Ivory sh*t' is aimed at those productions); instead, we get a lively, vibrant piece of work, with the camera sweeping through the gorgeous sets and leering at the exquisite costumes while recounting the grand story. And what a story: the thriller aspect aims to please viewers who find the genre a bit lacking in the tension department, whereas the Queen's doomed love affair with Joseph Fiennes' Earl of Leicester (a plot element to which the BBC miniseries from 2005, starring Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons, is a sort of sequel) is the polar opposite of the sanitized, passionless romantic tales that tend to feature in other period films.Good-looking technique and strong storytelling would, however, be useless if the title role wasn't played by an equally great actress, and Pakur found the perfect Elizabeth in Blanchett: an odd choice she may have seemed (she was a complete unknown in Hollywood prior to being cast in this movie), but the performance she delivers is nothing short of astonishing. Doubtful, determined, passionate, naive, heartbroken, firm and charismatic - she is quite simply the best on-screen incarnation of Elizabeth in the long history of biopics. The supporting cast (Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Richard Attenborough) is also excellent, as expected from British and Australian thespians, but it is Blanchett who dominates the entire picture. Shame the Academy didn't take notice.",9,62,74,13 January 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Bruckheimer does it again
","One thing has to be said about Jerry Bruckheimer: he isn't afraid of anything. Despite the frequent criticism he receives for having launched the dodgy careers of Tony Scott and Michael Bay (ironically with both achieving their finest work to date without his tutelage), he's also responsible for crowd-pleasing franchises like Beverly Hills Cop and Pirates of the Caribbean. Even by his standards, though, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a bit of a risk. Sure, he secured a competent director (Mike Newell, who helmed the best Harry Potter film to date) and a reliable cast (Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina), but the project still came with that one unpleasant characteristic: based on a video game. Then again, everyone said he was crazy when he wanted to make a movie out of a theme park ride, so maybe he had the right tools to get the game-to-film transition right for once. Based on the finished product, it looks like the gamble mostly paid off.Based on the fifth installment in the popular game series, The Sands of Time focuses on Gyllenhaal's Dastan, a street kid who finds himself adopted by the Persian king. Well loved by the people and his family, he does fine until a series of circumstances lead to his being accused of murdering the king and being on the run alongside the mysterious and beautiful Tamina (Gemma Arterton), guardian of a dagger that allows its user to travel back in time, something that might come in handy for Dastan to prove his innocence and save the kingdom.What makes Prince of Persia stand out in the genre is the fact that, except for the (excellent) scenes that involve running, jumping and fighting, it doesn't look like a video-game movie at all. In fact, the surprisingly coherent and fun script follows the Pirates of the Caribbean formula by combining equal doses of action, wit (the exchanges between Dastan and Tamina), pure laughs (Alfred Molina) and charismatic characters (ditto, plus Gyllenhaal, despite an initially shaky English accent). It's formulaic - no prizes for guessing who the villain is - but enjoyable, and the time travel aspect of the story makes the third act less ridiculous than it would have been in an average action flick.The only real defect, save for a bit of inevitable parallels between then and now (Persia is currently known as Iran, you know), is the fact that the compromise between Bruckheimer (money shots) and Newell (story and character) leads to some chunks of truly awful dialogue, especially the repetitive exposition scenes: is the audience's attention span really so limited that someone has to explain the dagger's function seven times over the course of two hours? Granted, there is time travel in the mix, but that doesn't mean we have to start over every single time. Maybe the screenwriters should have considered hitting the rewind button too.Overall, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is exactly what it sets out to be, namely a professionally crafted blockbuster that is guaranteed to entertain for a couple of hours. It doesn't quite pack the same charm as the first Pirates movie, but if Bruckheimer has his way and a new franchise begins, there's plenty of potential to exploit in future installments.",7,11,18,29 May 2010
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man returns...Wonderful news!
","In 2002, Sam Raimi proved he was the right man to give cinematic life to Marvel Comics'most popular character.With this sequel, he proves he can do the same thing again, only a lot better...Two years after the events of the first movie, Peter Parker's life hasn't got any better: the woman he loves is engaged to his boss's son, his best friend accuses Spider-Man of said friend's father's murder, and his powers are beginning to fail him(comparisons with Smallville aren't a problem, since the show's creators contributed to the Spider-man 2 script).Plus, there's a new weird guy in town: Dr.Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), aka Doc Ock.Trouble's on its way...This film is far more exciting and gripping than its predecessor, and it also contains some humor(check out Raimi-regular Bruce Campbell's cameo).The original actors are excellent, while Molina's Ock is more conflicted and charming than Willem Dafoe's superb Green Goblin.The movie also contains the most breathtaking action sequence ever,featuring Spidey, his nemesis and a speeding train.A real triumph within the genre, it makes the expectations for the third movie very high, as people wonder what Raimi can do to overshadow the greatest superhero movie after Batman Begins.The standout of summer 2004",10,13,19,8 October 2005
127 Hours," A true story that looks fake
","From the get-go, people were skeptical about this film adaptation of Aron Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place, and for good reason: it's hard to make a compelling drama about a man who spent five days of his life stuck in a canyon. Or, as Danny Boyle puts it: 'The audience has to care for the entire 127 hours, not just the last 40 minutes' (the contents of which it's best not to disclose in case someone isn't aware of how the story ends). Now, it is remarkable, even commendable, that Boyle used his newfound respectability (read: post-Oscar rise in fame) to get this seemingly impossible project off the ground, but throughout the film there's an awkward truth that emerges: he wasn't the right director for this project.A shame, since the story could lend itself to a good movie, provided certain adjustments were made. As Ralston recounts in his book, he should have told someone where he was going on that fateful day in 2003, when his latest mountain trip turned into a nightmare: stuck between a huge boulder and the mountain wall and unable to move, he quickly ran out of supplies and optimism, giving in to hallucinations and video-messages to his loved ones. Then, on the fifth day, he came up with a brave, shocking solution.The challenge, according to Boyle, was making 127 Hours a film that worked as a full dramatic unit, not just a money shot with an irrelevant build-up. His passion for the project was so big that, for the first time in his career, he has also worked on the script (alongside Slumdog Millionaire partner Simon Beaufoy). And for the first fifteen minutes or so, it looks like he's nailed the tone, capturing Aron's euphoria and naivety as he prepares for the hike, arrives at the canyon and interacts with two attractive girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) before his unfortunate experience. It's an approach that has worked before - the fun before the tragedy - and it sets up the plot nicely.Unfortunately, once Ralston is stuck (and Boyle with him, so to speak), the director has to figure out how to make the film gripping without leaving the canyon. His solution? He doesn't, allowing for several hallucination and dream sequences that allow him to expand the cast (Kate Burton and Treat Williams as the parents, Lizzy Caplan as the younger sister) and, more importantly, show off his visual trademarks once again. And there lies the real problem with 127 Hours: given the harrowing and very real subject matter, a certain restraint would be expected. Instead, the film is closer in tone to Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire, meaning the true story displayed on screen looks too fake and movie-like to fully convince. Okay, so the scenes in question are justified in terms of narrative (Ralston himself has admitted he was hallucinating), but playing them on a loop, like Boyle does (seriously, there's a dream sequence every five minutes), makes for a very repetitive and dull viewing.This also impacts on the central performance, arguably the film's main talking point. Though his talent has never been in question, be it as James Dean, Spider-Man's best friend or a comedy drug dealer, James Franco is justly regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation. However, he's never had to carry an entire movie (well, most of it) like he does here, and it's truly sad that Boyle struggles to keep his camera still, because the pain and despair reflected on Franco's face is the kind of a stuff that, if the overall movie were stronger, would definitely be worthy of an Oscar. Even if the growth (or rather lack thereof) of his facial hair over those five days is absolutely unrealistic.On paper, the combination of material, star and filmmaker was a good match. At the end of it all, though, the result is uneven and unconvincing, and it's all due to the director. Don't get me wrong, Danny Boyle is a very talented filmmaker. It's just that until he finds a way to keep his more visionary instincts in check, he should stay away from movies like this one.",5,20,42,7 February 2011
Pirate Radio," Let's rock!
","There are two recurring elements in Richard Curtis' filmography (besides Hugh Grant and loads of swearing, that is): awkward romances and great soundtracks. While the former has always been the best known, Curtis now tries to rectify it with his second directorial effort, The Boat that Rocked, which firmly places the emphasis on music. With the occasional romantic moment along the way.Partly based on real events, the movie deals with the struggles faced by rock and pop music to emerge in England in the early '60s, when the BBC only played one hour of that music per day. The solution: pirate radio stations, situated in the North Sea, playing rock music 24/7. The young protagonist of the film, one Carl (Jim Sturridge) is sent to help on the boat that broadcasts Radio Rock, and ends up sharing experiences with the eccentric manager (Bill Nighy) and the DJs, which include the sardonic Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the philandering Gavin (Rhys Ifans) and the weirdly lovable Doctor Dave (Nick Frost). Their biggest problem: the British government, specifically an uptight minister (Kenneth Branagh) who intends to shut down pirate radio for good.With romance taking a step back (albeit with enough room for a fun subplot or two), The Boat that Rocked is an affectionate and irreverent tribute to a lost era, deftly blending the right tunes - 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' plays during a scene that gleefully spoof Titanic - and a mix of sweet and raunchy comedy, with the latter having a more prominent spot in this very guy-centric picture (a scene involving the use of the F-word on the radio also serves as satire, given the picture itself, released almost 50 years after the events, is R-rated for its liberal use of expletives). Strangely enough, though, the political bit of the story, while benefiting from a brilliantly stiff-upper-lipped Branagh, is the weaker section of the film, if only because Curtis, famously unable to restrain himself at times, overplays the joke of an assistant (Jack Davenport) being named Twatt - a poor hangover from the fourth Blackadder series that becomes grating after the first few times.Then again, such issues are compensated by a lively pace, creative camera work and energetic performances. Sturridge does a good job as the audience surrogate getting us acquainted with the team, but the show is inevitably stolen by the more consummate players and, despite Hoffman's riotous work, the best laughs are inevitably British, with Nighy and Ifans delivering their customary Curtis-inspired performances and Frost proving he doesn't need Simon Pegg to shine. And for all the male-dominated atmosphere, fun cameos by January Jones and Emma Thompson make for some truly funny moments.In other words, The Boat that Rocked isn't exactly as good as Curtis' biggest hits (then again, not many films can match Four Weddings and a Funeral), but as a piece of excellently scored and foul-mouthed escapism it's quite brilliant on its own terms. Only a real Twatt wouldn't want to watch it.",8,3,4,11 December 2010
Batman Returns," Welcome back to Tim Burton's freak-show
","More than its predecessor, this movie really belongs to its director.Just read the plot summary: a disfigured child turns into the revolting Penguin(Danny De Vito), who plans revenge on Gotham City with evil businessman Max Schreck(Christopher Walken).They'll have to face two problems: Batman(Michael Keaton),the city's vigilante who spends his nights tracking down and arresting criminals, and Selina Kyle(Michelle Pfeiffer), Schreck's ex-secretary, back from the dead as the fascinating yet deadly Catwoman.It contains all of Burton's favorite stuff:extreme outcasts feared by ordinary people, a dark and Gothic landscape covered with snow(Gotham City at Christmas is visually delighting) and references to old horror movies(Christopher Walken played the lead in a seminal horror flick, as did the actor his character is named after).As in the previous film, it's more about Batman's opponents than the Caped Crusader himself.It's got little to do with Bob Kane's characters and all to do with Burton's creepy, twisted imagination.It's a film noir with a weird romance and even weirder heroes and villains.Just don't get fooled by the foreboding climax: the two subsequent flicks have nothing in common with this one, except the titular guy, not to mention that they're really awful.Anyway, this is a perfect introduction, alongside Edward Scissorhands, to Burton's genius, in case you haven't seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory yet.",9,0,0,13 October 2005
The Great Dictator," With no doubt Chaplin's finest work
","This timeless masterpiece is deservedly a milestone in movie history and in my opinion it's Charlie Chaplin's best movie. I had already seen him in other great films (Modern Times is comedy gold) but The Great Dictator stands alone as a funny yet serious movie that delivers an important message by making fun of one of the worst atrocities that ever took place. He mocks war and extermination in order to become a messenger of peace (his final speech is one of the best monologues I've ever heard), and he doesn't hesitate to achieve that through a satire on WWII Germany and Adolf Hitler.The movie's two protagonists are both played by Chaplin himself: one is a Jewish barber recovering from amnesia after a war accident who falls in love with Hannah (Paulette Godard), a girl who lives in the ghetto; the other one, who looks just like the barber, is dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who's planning to invade a couple of countries and overshadow 'colleague' Napaloni (aka Mussolini) as well as exterminate the Jewish minority. Expect trouble, misunderstandings and lots of laughs...This film is perhaps the best satire ever made, as Chaplin manages to entertain while still blaming the horrors committed by the Nazis, and he perfectly embodies both the romantic naive barber, who has one of the funniest lines in the movie ('Strange.And I thought you were an Aryan.' 'No, I'm a vegetarian.'), and the megalomaniac, ego-driven, constantly shouting Hynkel (his improvised speeches in fake German are hilarious), delivering a movie that makes people laugh and also think. Like other Holocaust-related films (Schindler's List, La Vita è Bella, The Pianist) it makes sure we'll never forget the past and learn from our mistakes.",10,2,4,6 December 2005
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," More X-Men than Wolverine, actually
","From the moment Hugh Jackman first appeared as Wolverine in Bryan Singer's X-Men, it was obvious his character would be the first choice for a spin-off film: brooding, tormented and totally bad-ass, he's one of the coolest creations in superhero comics. And so here it is, his own movie. Well, at least that's what it was meant to be.Taking advantage of the fact that Wolverine's origins have finally been unveiled in the comics as well, the film starts with a family tragedy which leads to the shaky alliance between two young stepbrothers in 19th century Canada. Both are gifted with heightened senses, and healing abilities that slow down the aging process, which is why, a hundred years and four wars later, Logan (Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) still look like they're pushing 40. At this point they're recruited by William Stryker (Danny Huston), a military scientist who uses mutants to do the government's dirty work. Unfortunately, Logan is disgusted by all the violence, despite being the most lethal member of the team (what with his retractable claws and all), and seeks a peaceful life. Due to fate - and Victor - that isn't possible, and thanks once again to Stryker, he is given the chance to get back at those who have wronged him. Thus begins a new chapter of Logan's life, one that is best summed up by the new name he has chosen for himself: Wolverine.As it happens, said new chapter is also the point where the film starts getting it kind of wrong: gone is the introspection and careful look at a conflicted, lonely (super)human being, replaced by state-of-the-art action scenes and a truckload of new characters. Okay, so the showdown between Logan and a helicopter is admittedly a very cool moment, but why the sudden shift in tone, given Jackman (who's also the movie's producer) was lucky enough to get David Benioff (25th Hour) as the screenwriter (but hey, Hit-man writer Skip Woods was also involved) and Oscar-winner Gavin Hood (Tsotsi) as the director? The answer is disheartening and not very unexpected: fan demands. The film's title isn't simply Wolverine, it's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, meaning that once the origin bit was explained, it was perceived as no big deal to randomly insert popular characters from the comics who couldn't be included in the previous X-movies: some of them (Taylor Kitsch's Gambit) work to a certain degree, others (a pre-X-Men Scott Summers) appear at the expense of people who actually fit into the story, like the hilarious Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), whose presence is basically reduced to a teaser for his own spin-off (assuming it gets made, obviously).Make no mistake: Hood is a skilled director, and the first hour of the film stands out as a very good introduction to one of Marvel's most loved 'heroes', but much like Sam Raimi did with Spider-Man 3, he finds himself dealing with a second half that loses its focus while trying to please fan-boys (as well as providing a nonsensical explanation for the protagonist's memory loss). On the plus-side, a quick pace means the lesser parts are over quickly, and Jackman, now playing the Canadian mutant for the fourth time, is as charismatic as ever, brilliantly aided by Schreiber and Huston (and the shamefully underused Reynolds).X-Men Origins: Wolverine is not exactly a bad film (it has good action, a terrific first half and a solid cast), but it's painfully obvious this could have been something completely different had it been handed to original X-director Bryan Singer. The post-credits scene seems to suggest a sequel can be expected: fine, but could it focus solely on Wolverine, please? 6,5/10",7,2,5,5 May 2009
Alexander," Overly ambitious and uneven, but worth a look
","People didn't like this movie mostly because of Alexander the Great's bisexuality. Frankly, I find it ridiculous, since in ancient Greece 'bisexuality' was not only frequent, but also accepted. Moreover, there's only one actual sex scene in the movie, and a pretty laughable one at that, featuring Alexander's (Colin Farrell) tormented wedding night with his wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson). The incriminated moments, namely the Great's 'affair' with childhood friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto), are very chaste, all based on looks, not even a kiss. Those scenes are a bit awkward, that's true, and you might think one such sequence would have been enough, but the 'gay scenes' are actually the least significant of Alexander's many problems.It's easy to see why Oliver Stone wanted to make this ambitious film: like most of his work, it's a story of power, paranoia and conspiracies (JFK, anyone?). This is evident from the beginning, when Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins), the movie's narrator, remembers Alexander's childhood (the film's most even section, albeit too short): the young boy is constantly prepared to become king of Macedonia, by practicing horse riding and receiving a proper education from the famous Aristotle (Christopher Plummer). Nonetheless, his life is far from happy, courtesy of his parents: king Philip (Val Kilmer, a riotous but underused presence) is a drunken, foolish tyrant who will even get married three times in order to make friends with the right people; queen Olympias (a scene-stealing turn from Angelina Jolie) is a cruel, manipulative woman, frequently surrounded by snakes and eager to get her husband out of the way. In fact, when the king is murdered, she doesn't mourn him at all (and conspiracy theorists will happily feed on this).With two individuals like those raising him, it's no wonder Alexander decided to leave his home and conquer most of the then known world, a masterful task he fulfilled before suddenly and mysteriously dying, aged 33 (the movie actually opens with that scene, played in slow motion). And it's in telling this part of the story, which occupies most of the film, that Stone exceeds in his ambitions, just like his subject did: the director feels completely at home when he's staging the massive, chaotic, gory battle sequences, but there are only two of them in a movie that's almost three hours long, and he fails to inject the same energy and enthusiasm in most of the scenes showcasing the Great's last years, when the almighty conqueror becomes a paranoid loner. It also doesn't help that Colin Farrell never fully manages to shake off his 'bad boy' image (and his Irish accent), something that gives a 'camp' feel to certain moments. This also occurs when Stone starts hinting at an incestuous affair between Olympias and Alexander, a suggestion that brings the mother/son scenes to the brink of the ridiculous, courtesy of excessive shouting from Farrell and too many 'evil' looks from Jolie (Stephen Frears pulled off a much better job handling the same theme on The Grifters).Still, this movie is worth watching: it may not be Stone's best, but when he really nails it, he makes you understand what a fascinating and unique man Alexander the Great was.6,5/10",7,0,9,13 November 2005
Troy," Not exactly Ben-Hur or Spartacus, but still enjoyable
","No gods (with the exception of Julie Christie's cameo as Achilles'mother).Delayed or anticipated deaths.Mr 'Nice Guy' Brad Pitt(with a British accent)playing brutal warrior Achilles.These are some of the reasons Troy was hated by Greek mythology purists, and I have to admit, being something of a purist myself, that the absence of the various gods annoyed me(I think Michael Douglas would have been good as Zeus,while Hugh Jackman could have been a decent Ares,god of war). As for the other things, since a few characters are more boring or rotten than in the Iliad, changing their demise time isn't that shocking.And Brad Pitt?Well, accent aside, he's actually enjoyable as the half-divine killer.The same can't be said for Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom, whose forbidden love fuels the Trojan war in the first place.They're a handsome couple, that's true, but their acting makes the romance so insipid.But who cares?We're here to watch the bloody battles.Well, not that bloody, actually:the final duel between Achilles and Hector, which was the most graphic part of the Iliad, is reduced to five bloodless minutes.As for the rest of the cast, the only ones who are really satisfying turn out to be two Trojans(weird, considering we're supposed to hate them),Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole,playing Hector and his father Priam, as well as one Greek, Odysseus, portrayed by Sean Bean(for once he's a good guy).It may not be entirely faithful to the source material(the audience will prefer the Trojans), but if you ignore the flaws, you can enjoy Troy for what it is: a visually impressive, decently acted, Hollywood-style epic.",7,4,9,4 October 2005
Brokeback Mountain," A painful masterpiece
","I have to admit, when I first heard this movie was getting made (December 2003, on Italian TV), I never thought I would see it, as the idea of watching a 'gay Western' wasn't that appealing (actually, I wasn't a big fan of the Western genre in general back then, but that was before I saw Dances with Wolves and The Searchers). Then I heard it had won the Golden Lion in Venice, whereas everyone thought the award would go to Good Night, and Good Luck. And now it has won four Golden Globes and will most probably get this year's Best Picture Oscar. Yes, it is that good, and I don't regret I finally went to see it.The film is directed by Ang Lee, a filmmaker who can seamlessly move from a genre to another and make an excellent picture (his last effort, Hulk, suffered from some bad SFX, but otherwise it was an interesting film). Brokeback Mountain is no exception, in fact it's arguably Lee's best movie ever, beating even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's a gripping, heartbreaking, painful film, and labeling it as a 'gay Western' is to entirely miss the point. It's a love story, and a very universal one, which just happens to involve two men.The story begins in Wyoming, 1963. While shepherding on the titular mountain, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) develop a friendship which eventually leads to a night of brutal, almost animal sex. After an embarrassing exchange ('You know I ain't queer';'Me neither') , the two men part and don't see each other again for four years. When they finally meet, they're both married (to Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway respectively) and have children, but the passion they've been holding inside them for so long is still there, and for the following twenty years, they occasionally return to Brokeback, in order to freely express that passion.The movie's greatness lies in its honesty, the forbidden love story at its center being so pure and touching, you don't care that the love-birds are both men. It's a doomed, tragic romance, which won't last forever, even if Jack wishes it could be so.Pain, honesty and sadness permeate the entire movie, and they're obvious in the flawless performances: Michelle Williams is astounding as the faithful wife who suddenly bursts out in panic as she discovers the truth, and Gyllenhaal is amazingly perfect as the idealist who wants more than 'a few high-altitude f**ks once or twice a year'. But it's Ledger who surprises more than anyone with what has to be his best performance to date: a conflicted, brooding individual who chooses to hide his true emotions until it's too late. This is one of those cases where a single look is much more powerful than all the words in the universe.I really hope this masterpiece will get the recognition it deserves at the Oscars. In my opinion, the best picture of 2005, as well as one of the best films I've ever seen.",10,38,46,30 January 2006
500 Days of Summer," 95 minutes of magic
","'Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.'. Starting with the tag-line, it was clear that (500) Days of Summer wasn't going to be a typical romantic comedy. In fact, this film stands out as one of the rare genuine shots in the arm said genre so desperately needs, and that it succeeds is largely due to one thing: it's not really that romantic.As the film's co-writer Michael Weber pointed out when the film was shown at the 2009 Locarno Film Festival (on the opening night, no less), the screenplay is 'loosely' based on something that happened to his creative partner Scott Neustadter - something that is hilariously mentioned right before the opening credits (a brilliant spin on the familiar 'any resemblance with real events is coincidental' caption). Not that the information is essential in order to enjoy the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect who writes greeting cards for a living, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's new secretary. Tom falls for her immediately, whereas she doesn't believe in true love. Despite that jarring contrast, the two actually end up together, although Summer's 'allergy' to commitment is likely to cause problems...So far, so predictable, right? How fortunate, then, that first-time director Marc Webb, aided by the writers, has decided to tell the story in non-linear fashion: the movie begins right after the break-up, and what happened before (and after) is reconstructed over the following 90 minutes. The aim is allegedly to play on the non-linearity of memory (the script jumps from day 1 to 300 or something), which allows the filmmakers to have a lot of fun movie-wise, thanks to clever editing - Tom entering an elevator happy and leaving heartbroken - and genre mixing, with the couple's conflicting views allowing for mental digressions that range from classic musicals to, of all people, Ingmar Bergman (the last time he got mentioned in a comedy was due to Woody Allen). Also, given Webb's music video pedigree, the soundtrack is very good and, unusually for a rom-com, devoid of sloppy sentiment (hello, Richard Curtis).The other winning factor in the film is the combination of dialogue, which is smart yet real, and performances, specifically the two leads: no offense to the fine supporting cast (Clark Gregg, Chloe Moretz, Criminal Minds' Matthew Gray Gubler), but the movie wouldn't be half as charming if it weren't for Gordon-Levitt, funny and vulnerable in equal measure, and the lovely Deschanel, who gracefully charms, laughs and sings her way through the entire film. Ironically, considering the film's plot, they are a perfect couple.(500) Days of Summer is a little film that can, and will, entertain and move audiences everywhere. It's a romantic comedy that intelligently subverts or avoids most of the genre's clichés (including the romance) without ever coming off as a smug or cynical exercise in style. It also manages to overcome the 'I know how it's gonna end' obstacle beautifully, with what is arguably one of the year's best closing lines. What's not to love?",9,1,2,25 December 2009
L.A. Confidential," Essential Film Noir
","L.A. Confidential, one of the best pictures of the '90s (in fact, it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar: it's so much better than Titanic), is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an 'unfilmable' book: Curtis Hanson (with the help of co-writer Brian Helgeland) has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece (which is 800 pages long) into a 135-minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!The story takes place in L.A., early '50s. It's a city where everything looks perfect, where everybody goes to become a movie star. But, as Danny De Vito's opening voice-over informs us, it's not as good as it looks: the 'City of Angels' is actually run by Al Capone-clones such as Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle, aka CSI's Brass), and the police... Well, it just so happens a lot of the LAPD is among the mob's unofficial employees. And it's in this kind of environment that we first meet the three key players: Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an ambitious young man who wants to be as good as his dad and do his job properly, even if that includes turning in his colleagues; Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a disillusioned cop who not only accepts violence as part of the job, but even uses it as often and much as possible in his personal crusade against wife-beating men (as his partner puts it:'You're like Santa Claus with that list, Bud, Except everyone on it's been naughty'); and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is the classic 'Hollywood Cop', who gets paid by tabloids to bust coke-snorting celebrities. These three men, so different, will have to join forces when they discover their respective cases, which involve corruption, drugs, prostitution and various murders, are all linked to the Nite Owl massacre...The award-winning script's focus is on the differences and similarities that connect the three protagonists and their views on the law. Hanson has completely removed the subplots concerning Vincennes and Exley's love lives (which occupied quite a bit of the book), preferring to show us only the bond between Bud White and Lynn Bracken, a whore but also the one person who truly understands the conflict and hatred that are at the center of the brutal cop's mind and soul. She's an extraordinary person, and she's played by a great actress: Kim Basinger, who was justly given an Oscar for her performance. As for the other actors, L.A. Confidential kick-started Pearce's career, confirmed Spacey's status as Best Actor of the Decade and reminded us that James Cromwell and David Strathairn are two of the best character actors around. But it's Crowe, in his Hollywood debut, who really steals the show. Forget A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, hell, even Gladiator: this is the role that should have obtained the Academy's attention.New to the genre? This movie is a good start, alongside The Untouchables. Already a fan, and excited about Brian De Palma's upcoming adap of Ellroy's The Black Dahlia? Just keep watching L.A. Confidential in the meantime.",10,13,20,15 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Captain Jack leaves with style... Yo ho!
","So, this is it: another massively popular blockbuster franchise reaches its conclusion. After Spider-Man and Shrek, it is time to say goodbye to Pirates of the Caribbean (and Jason Bourne will follow in a few months), although, like many other number 3s, At World's End vaguely suggests a fourth movie would not be impossible to make (and we will see what Bruckheimer thinks about it once the cash starts rolling in). Still, should this be the last Pirates, it isn't a bad epilogue, though not a truly brilliant one either.Picking up about a month after the events of Dead Man's Chest, the third episode opens on a surprisingly dark note: with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) 'dead' (actually, he's stuck in some sort of Purgatory) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) working for Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), piracy is facing extinction, as shown in the prologue, where dozens of people, including a young boy, are hung without a fair trial. All hope is not lost, though, as a small group of rebels, led by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is reuniting pirate leaders from all over the world to come up with a plan to get back their control over the sea. The only problem is, one player is missing: time to bring Jack back...That is when the film really starts: no offense to the rest of the cast, but POTC's success depends entirely on Johnny Depp, and so it is slightly frustrating to have to wait half an hour for his entrance. But once he arrives, it was completely worth the wait: adding new nuances and quirks to the character, Depp is shamelessly entertaining from start to finish, whether he is talking to himself (the 'multiple Jacks' scenes are hilarious) or interacting with others (especially Rush and Knightley). His charisma is what keeps the movie on track, especially in the third act, where it is all too obvious writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio finished the script when filming had already begun: some inconsistencies are given a rushed (and a little pompous) explanation (e.g. how come Jack's resurrection was much more complicated than Barbossa's ?), others are not explained at all, and while it is a joy to see the balance between action (Black Pearl vs. Flying Dutchman: a visual treat) and laughs (the two moronic soldiers from the first film finally return after an inexplicable absence in Dead Man's Chest, and Keith Richards' cameo is comedy gold as expected) is intact, the story's complexity seems to slip out of control in places, probably because unlike Sam Raimi, who constructed the similarly flawed Spider-Man 3 starting from elements he had introduced in the first two films, the writing duo behind Pirates created a huge mythology almost separately from the first installment. Whereas Curse of the Black Pearl featured only one ambiguous character (Captain Sparrow) in an otherwise linear series of events, this time everyone betrays everyone, making At World's End move from twist to twist, even after the climactic showdown, providing an extra fifteen minutes (and the entire film lasts almost three hours) that are, for the most part, skippable.And yet I liked the movie, and I am willing to forgive those missteps. Why? Because at the end of this overblown, but spectacular and tremendously fun ride, everyone realizes what Pirates of the Caribbean was about in the first place: the trilogy started with Jack, and it ends (?) with Jack. And that, my friends, is good enough to justify the excessive running time.6,5/10",6,1,3,27 May 2007
X-Men," The first step in superhero movie evolution...
","X-Men is a very good, stylish, exciting comic-book movie. Which is a positive thing, considering the last 'big' superhero flick released before this one was, uh, Batman & Robin. This first movie featuring Stan Lee's 'Children of the Atom' is not based on a particular story (with the exception of the characters' origins), as director Bryan Singer uses a plot almost entirely made from scratch to introduce us to a new world: the mutant one.The setting is the United States, in a soon-to-come future: mutants, people born with a genetic alteration (the so called 'X-gene') which gives them superhuman abilities, are becoming more and more common. Unfortunately, the rest of humanity fears them and some even try to destroy them. This brings us to the current situation: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, the X-Men, which include Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), think peace is possible; his old friend Magneto (Ian McKellen), on the other hand, is firmly convinced war is inevitable, since he already has witnessed genocide (he's Jewish and his parents were killed in Auschwitz). As such, he and his allies, the Brotherhood of Mutants, will not allow US Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) to pass the Mutant Registration Act, and the only thing that can stop them is Xavier's students, plus two new mutants, the claw-wearing, virtually invincible Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the power-stealing Rogue (Anna Paquin).The X-Men comic books have always been an interesting sci-fi oriented reflection on such concepts as racism and alienation, a theme that emerges quite vividly throughout Singer's filmography (his previous movie, Apt Pupil, dealt with a lonely kid who forms a morbid bond with a former Nazi). In particular, Xavier and Magneto are seen as the mutant versions of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - two people who respect each other, but choose to respectfully disagree on how to deal with specific problems. The movie takes this one step further by highlighting the philosophical and moral contradiction of Magneto, an Auschwitz survivor, trying to prevent a new extermination by causing another one himself (the role is made even more ironic by the fact that McKellen played the Nazi in Apt Pupil).Alongside the thematic relevance, Singer also has to deliver in terms of action, and deliver he does, thanks to a spectacular third act which features the kind of iconic moments fans will love instantly. That being said, the film does have a defect, and that's the plot being structured as if it were the pilot episode of a TV show (in fairness, though, several first installments are written that way, but less directly) or, as Patrick Stewart put it, an extended trailer, in which all the main characters (except for a couple of villains) are thoroughly introduced so that the audience will understand who they are and what they do. Then again, such a move is justified by the solid cast the director has assembled: Stewart and McKellen were a quality guarantee from the get-go, and everyone else complies as well, particularly Jackman and Paquin, the outsiders who act as our guides in this new, exciting cinematic universe.So, entirely satisfying it may not be, but the first X-Men is the film that effectively started the new wave of intelligent, above-average comic book movies. And that can only be considered a good thing.",8,1,2,20 December 2005
Spider-Man 3," Third time's a charm... or maybe not
","In 2002, Spider-Man was a huge hit, impressing comic-book fans and critics alike. Two years later, the sequel gained even more praise, justly regarded as one of the few follow-ups that actually improve on the original. Needless to say, expectations were justifiably high for the third installment. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 is the least strong ('worst' is too harsh with a Raimi flick) entry in the franchise (officiallly a trilogy, but there's a strong chance a fourth movie will get made).Whereas in the first two movies he enjoyed getting his hero in trouble, this time Raimi (who also wrote the script with his brother Ivan) opens the film with an illusion of happiness: Peter Parker is an excellent student, is about to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him and, best of all, has been able to convince the people of New York his web-slinging alter ego isn't the criminal J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons, still a riot) makes him appear to be. Naturally, this being a Spider-Man movie, things start going downhill pretty fast: first of all, MJ is fired from a Broadway show because of bad reviews; then there's Harry Osborn (James Franco), Peter's best friend, still eager to avenge the 'murder' of his father (Willem Dafoe, who makes a brief but memorable appearance about twenty minutes into the film); moreover, an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), aka Sandman, is revealed to be the real killer of the beloved Uncle Ben. And let's not forget Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a cocky photographer who's trying to steal Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. Quite a lot to handle at once, don't you think?In fact, the presence of three distinct villains - generally not a good thing, as Batman & Robin 'memorably' proved - is the main flaw of the movie, despite Raimi's attempts to construct a coherent plot with the bad guys having a section each until the overblown climactic showdown where they all come together. Not that the actors are bad or anything: James Franco's logical evolution from best friend to new archnemesis works perfectly, and Haden Church brings an unexpected maturity to a potentially campy role (besides, his arc allows Cliff Robertson, aka Uncle Ben, to make a welcome return in a couple of flashbacks). As for Grace, his problem is strictly time-related: the whole movie builds up to his character's transformation in Venom, one of the most loved villains of the comics. Raimi, however, has openly stated he doesn't like him, and so Venom gets a total of six minutes to impress us, which is too little even for Grace's considerable charm and talent (Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays MJ's potential rival Gwen Stacy, is similarly underused). Still, the 'evil trio' allows Spidey to exclaim 'Where do all these guys come from?', a deliberate in-joke that sets the tone for the entire film: the trailer promised a darker installment, akin to Christopher Nolan's version of Batman, and there are a few pretty grim moments, but most of the time those scenes are replaced by moments of absurd humor. This isn't a new technique coming from Raimi (he mastered the same balance between laughs and shocks in the Evil Dead trilogy), and the comic-book is well known for pulling off the exact same stunt, but this time the director hits overload, causing a tonal confusion: the usual cameos by Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell (the latter gets listed in the opening credits despite being in only one scene) are hilarious, while Peter's 'evil' dance routine (see it to believe it) borders on ridiculous. Overall, Spider-Man 3 isn't really a bad film: the story works to a reasonable extent, Maguire and Dunst still share a perfect chemistry, and the visual effects are as stunning as ever. Nevertheless, there's a distinct feeling that something's missing. Maybe next time Raimi will remember this: in some cases, less truly is more.",7,1,4,8 May 2007
Yes Man," Yeah, why not?
","When was the last time Jim Carrey was really funny? Yep, that would be back in 2004, when he delivered a double mixture of creepy (Lemony Snicket) and touching (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, his best role to date), both paired with his natural comedic talent, which was significantly watered down in the disappointing Fun With Dick & Jane and consistently missing in the excessively weird The Number 23. Yes Man is the perfect antidote, then: a typical Carrey comedy, where the gags abound and the soul department is a little empty. Not that we're gonna complain that much - it's just that the source material indicated the film could have been a little more... you know.The material in question is Danny Wallace's eponymous autobiographical book, in which he recounts what happened to him after he attended a 'Yes Men' seminar and vowed to say 'yes' for six months. In the movie, the action is moved from England to Los Angeles, and Wallace is replaced by Carl Allen (Carrey), a bank employee who hasn't had a real life since his marriage ended. Instead of hanging out with his friends (Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson, both criminally underused) or helping his neighbors, he spends his days working or renting movies he subsequently disses during the viewing. Everything changes when an old friend invites him to a 'Yes' convention where the British host (Terence Stamp, who else?) advises him to greet every offer that crosses his path with the same answer. Any need to guess which that is?From then on, it's just like Liar, Liar or Bruce Almighty: a torrent of gags which stem from the absurd (yet undeniably plausible) premise. The jokes range from predictable (Carl replying to spam messages) to somewhat original (Carl learning Korean) to quite outlandish (Carl preventing a man from committing suicide in a most unusual way; Wallace has pointed out this never happened to him, by the way). Throw in a sweet, enthralling romance with free spirit Allison (the always charming Zooey Deschanel), and you've got a comedy that ticks practically every box. The most important, of course, is the one concerning Carrey, who mixes full-on comedy and heartfelt seriousness with the ease one could expect after his marvelous turns in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine. Too bad he's also stuck with a director who can't give the serious bits the dignity they crave (but hey, what can you demand from the guy who did Bring It On?). And that's without mentioning the obvious contrivance that is used to get to the third act.Still, Yes Man has enough ingredients to make for a nice, though not entirely satisfying viewing: there's a relatively good central idea, Deschanel and Stamp in supporting roles and Carrey going ballistic. Would die-hard fans of the comedian really ask for more?",7,1,2,7 January 2009
Zodiac," Paced, suspenseful, gripping - the first real must-see of 2007!
","It is about a serial killer. And it is directed by David Fincher. Se7en 2? Absolutely not. Fincher has never repeated himself, and there is no way he will start now. Se7en was a terrifying, unflinching thriller that offered no hope or comfort; Zodiac is equally bleak, but at the same time unlike any other serial killer movie made before.For the first time, Fincher handles a true story, and a pretty dark one for that matter: with five confirmed murders and another thirty-two he claimed responsibility for, the Zodiac was the American version of Jack the Ripper. Like the English psychopath, Zodiac was never captured (the police interrogated several suspects, with no results), and the two also shared a fascination for sending letters to the authorities, making fun of people's foolish attempts to uncover their identities. It is this aspect that interests the director: the killer's relationship with law enforcement and media. There is no room for the actual murderer or his grand plan (not that he has one), like in Se7en; Zodiac is a tale of obsession, of how one man indelibly affected four people who spent most of their lives trying to solve one of the USA's greatest mysteries.The film begins on the fourth of July, 1969: a young couple making out in a car is brutally attacked by an unknown assailant. The girl dies, the boy lives and leaves San Francisco, and the killer sends a letter to the S.F. Chronicle, taking credit for the crime and inviting the reporters to identify with a cypher he has enclosed to the message. Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) immediately asserts the cypher is bogus, and is indeed proved right, but at the same time he develops an unusual interest for the Zodiac, and joins the booze-addicted Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr., who gives the film's most affecting, painfully real performance) on a quest to solve the puzzle. As they keep seeking the truth, their paths cross with those of David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo, the other standout in a mesmerizing ensemble) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards, in his first relevant role since he left E.R.), two SFPD detectives whose only thought is to find the elusive psycho and lock him up forever.The case goes on for several years (the final scene's caption reads '1991'), and in order to accurately depict those years Fincher didn't just use Graysmith's books Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked as basis for the screenplay, he also reread old files and even talked to anyone who was personally involved in the events (which is why not all the murders are shown on screen: the director omitted those for which he could not find a surviving victim or witness), which explains why it took so long to complete the film (Fincher's last effort, Panic Room, was released in 2002). This attention to detail pays off, as we are offered as complete a recollection as there can be of the facts, spread over 160 minutes that never feel stretched or boring: the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning and never lets go, its content being too unsettling and important to be ignored. Unlike From Hell, which upset a lot of people for its theories regarding the Ripper's real name and motive, Fincher does not try to make the audience believe anything, but simply tells what has been verified, although it is obvious he shares the characters'feelings towards the prime suspect (Arthur Leigh Allen, played with nerve-cracking conviction by John Carroll Lynch). He does not even show off with his usual camera trickery (the only exception being a scene where the accelerated construction of the Transamerica building indicates that a year has passed), not because, as some might claim, he has 'matured', but because he felt that was right for the kind of story he is telling. Zodiac is more similar to All The President's Men than Se7en, and like Alan J. Pakula's masterpiece it is all about time, place and character, not action or blood.At one point, Paul Avery says: 'He offed a few citizens, wrote a few notes and faded into a footnote'. Therein lies the movie's true nature: it is not interested in telling the story of a killer, partly because this particular criminal has already been used by Hollywood (Dirty Harry's Scorpio was based on the Zodiac), but that of a group of ordinary people so desperate to give a face to the name that haunted them they spent decades working on a case they knew from the start would not be solved.Fincher considers his sixth film 'the definitive serial killer film'. He has got a point: by giving no real answers or glimpses of optimism he sets Zodiac apart from traditional thrillers, which will all seem like fairy tales in comparison. The real thing is much more complex and painful, but also, in the end, far more compelling than the usual mainstream product. An astonishing achievement, and the year's first truly unmissable movie.9,5/10",10,3,4,27 May 2007
The Prestige," A deceptive, spellbinding piece of supreme film-making
","'Are you watching closely?'. This question is repeated several times in Christopher Nolan's fifth feature, a complex, compelling opus that sees him return to Mementoish territory.Set in Victorian London, The Prestige deals with magic, although not the kind we're used to: what we see is a much darker side of this fascinating profession, which might even be lethal to some people. In fact, death is present from the beginning: right after Michael Caine's opening monologue about the three acts every magic trick is divided in (the third act gives the film its title) we witness a tragedy, as the famous Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), aka The Great Danton, drowns during his last performance. His colleague and former friend Alfred 'The Professor' Borden (Christian Bale) is accused of murdering the showman, and as he's sent to jail the events that led to that fatal night are told in a series of interconnected flashbacks: the two used to work together, under the guidance of the experienced Cutter (Caine), and were quite good friends, until a terrible tragedy put an end to that comradeship. As the years pass, the rivalry between them gets more and more dangerous, the two using their different qualities (Borden has better tricks, Angier more charisma) to become the best magician in Europe, in a conflict so devastating it might destroy everything they have.It's not just the audacious storytelling that makes The Prestige similar to Memento. The two films also share the key theme: obsession. Leonard Shelby, the disturbed protagonist of Memento, insisted on tracking down the man who killed his wife, even though he knew he probably wouldn't succeed because of his inability to form new memories. The same thing happens to Angier and Borden: they're so obsessed with winning the duel they don't even care about the people surrounding them or what actually made them enemies in the first place. Around these layered, mysterious and intriguing characters Nolan constructs a riveting picture with stunning attention to detail: like his protagonists, the director fools the audience while laying out the clues that will lead to the shocking final revelation, a mind-blowing climax which adds poignancy to Cutter's instantly memorable line 'You want to be fooled...'.In his intent, Nolan is impeccably helped by his cast, each of the actors, including Scarlett Johansson as both magicians'assistant/mistress and David Bowie as the eccentric scientist Nikola Tesla, adding shades of darkness and ambiguity. Bale and Caine, working with the director for the second consecutive time, are superb, playing interesting variations of their Batman Begins roles (tormented, lonely leading man and wise, caring mentor/father figure respectively) and raising expectations for said movie's sequel, and Jackman is easily their match, successfully developing the emotional maturity he began to show in X2 and delivering his finest performance to date. The real star, however, remains Nolan, who consistently pulls the right strings in the right moment, thus ensuring The Prestige is one of the absolutely best films of 2006, not to mention (possibly) his best achievement so far.",10,2,4,9 January 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A fantasy in comic-book disguise: beautiful, exciting and fun
","With the first Hellboy, there was a feeling that for all the good things in it (Ron Perlman especially) Guillermo del Toro wasn't allowed to do all he wanted. Now, with the success of Pan's Labyrinth, not to mention Universal instead of Sony, he has been granted complete freedom, and the result is Hellboy II: The Golden Army, the second best sequel of 2008 after The Dark Knight (Indiana Jones is a) a number four; b) a different genre, and therefore doesn't count).Beginning in true del Toro fashion, Hellboy II starts with a flashback where Professor Broom (John Hurt, still good), the protagonist's adoptive father, fills the same function as in the first movie and introduces us to the story, only this time he does it recounting an old legend, according to which the king of an ancient non-human race made a truce with mankind so that everyone would live in peace. Just a story, Hellboy says. Wrong: the king's son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), having witnessed the 'horrors' of modern society, intends to declare war on all humanity and resurrect the dreaded Golden Army, mechanical soldiers who feel no hunger, no need to sleep and most of all no mercy.Another job for the BPRD, then, only there are a few problems: Hellboy (Perlman), is going through a rough patch with his girlfriend, the 'fiery' Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), and keeps getting noticed by the public during missions, which drives his boss (Jeffrey Tambor) crazy. For that reason, the ghostly Johann Krauss (voiced by Seth McFarlane, aka Peter Griffin) is assigned to make sure Red, Liz and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, this time doing the voice too) stick to protocol. Then the new threat materializes, and before there's time for Hellboy to say 'Oh, crap!', the world as we know it is once again facing complete annihilation.The story of the Golden Army isn't to be found in any of Mike Mignola's comic books. In fact, he and del Toro came up with it specifically for the film, knowing that kind of premise would allow the director to go crazy with his imagination, be it weird creatures or new, fantastic worlds. From a merely visual point of view, Hellboy II is one of the most beautiful genre films of recent years, a clear indication of why Peter Jackson chose del Toro to direct The Hobbit. Sure, his depiction of the Troll Market is no Middle Earth, but a brief scene featuring a Hell- like dimension (and Jones playing the Angel of Death, a direct descendant of the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth) is a striking reminder of Mordor.That's where the LOTR comparisons end, though: Nuada is no Sauron, and Hellboy sure as hell (pun not intended) is no Frodo, which is exactly why we love him. Perlman, now wearing the part like a second skin, is as oddly cool as ever, with his cigar, bad temper and no- nonsense attitude ('I'm not gonna kill him, Abe. But I will kick his ass!'). Del Toro even allows the story to get more personal, with careful focus on the bizarre love story between Red and Liz, which results in Blair getting more screen-time and giving a proper glimpse of her talent (plus, Rupert Evans is gone - good). Goss is a rather good villain, though slightly less menacing than Kroenen and blatantly overshadowed by two things: the sidekicks (the always reliable Jones and Tambor, with additional help from McFarlane) and most importantly the actual Golden Army - when it appears, it's one of the most amazing set-ups ever in a fantasy/superhero picture.In short: virtually everything you could expect from a good sequel: laughs ( check out Hellboy and Abe getting drunk), emotion, action, suspense and much, much more. Let's hope del Toro does get around to making the promised trilogy closer (though it would take a while, what with The Hobbit and all): it's hard to resist the charm of good old Red.",9,4,5,22 October 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Burton does horror, and quite well too...
","Forget the animated Disney short. Tim Burton's first (and, to date, only) real horror movie has nothing to do with the 'toon many of us so fondly remember. It's bleak, gory, bizarre, and utterly brilliant.The main difference between the two versions is the protagonist: Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is no longer a teacher, but an eccentric inspector sent to Sleepy Hollow so that he can use his 'scientific methods' to solve a series of appalling murders. He is firmly convinced the killer is human and everything has a rational explanation. Soon enough, though, he will realize he's facing a criminal like no other: the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken in flashbacks) is not the usual murderer, and cannot be defeated with conventional weapons.Burton has successfully made this movie his own, thanks to the creepy sets, Danny Elfman's grandiose music, the grotesque and ambiguous characters (flawlessly portrayed by such actors as Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson), and Depp's freaky leading man. He has even added one of his most personal touches: the eerie flashback which shows Ichabod's childhood and justifies his behavior (see also Batman and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for similar sequences). Without giving away the plot, it's one of Sleepy Hollow's most shocking moments.A very smart and unusual horror flick (though, as in the case of John Carpenter's Vampires, it's more gory than scary), and a must-see for Burton fans.",9,1,2,13 February 2006
Ocean's Twelve," Not really the new Eleven...
","This is one of those cases where the law of diminishing returns unfortunately applies.Three years after the Bellagio heist in Vegas, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his mates are tracked down by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who wants his money back. With interest. In two weeks. Or he'll kill every last one of them. Therefore the team decides to move to Europe, so that they can steal some valuable stuff. They only have two problems: one is Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an Interpol agent on their trail, who also happens to be Rusty's (Brad Pitt) former girlfriend; the other one is a French con-man (Vincent Cassel) who seems to be ahead of them all the time.Original crime caper Ocean's Eleven is a very good film, mainly because of the script. The same can't be said about this sequel: the screenplay was originally written for a John Woo flick, and sadly, people can notice that: it's SO obvious the plot was altered just to let Clooney and the others go fooling around in France and Italy. Also, why call the movie Ocean's Twelve and make Rusty the team-leader? OK, so this time HIS love interest is causing trouble, but why didn't the writer just name the film Ryan's Twelve in that case?Anyway, Twelve still has some appeal, thanks to one of its predecessor's key elements: great actors. Despite the discontinuous script, all the cast-members obviously enjoyed shooting this film, and I enjoyed watching their work. Matt Damon, in particular, steals the show as the insecure Linus, who would like 'a more central role this time'. The new entries (Zeta-Jones, Cassel) are quite good too, but the real treat is Bruce Willis'uncredited cameo as himself: Albert Finney, Robbie Coltrane and Eddie Izzard's brief appearances impress as well, but Bruno's presence is, along with Clooney asking people 'How old do you think I am?', the funniest, and probably best sequence in the entire film. You might not like all of it, but that scene really is worth watching.Altogether, a bit disappointing but still enjoyable. Will keep you entertained for two hours, should you choose to see it.",7,0,1,19 February 2006
Crash," Flawed but strong handling of a relevant topic
","First things first: I think the Academy made a mistake naming Crash the best picture of 2005. Not that I didn't like the movie: it just so happens that it has a few defects that make it less Oscar-worthy than fellow nominee (and strongest contender until the ceremony actually took place) Brokeback Mountain. That said, the movie deals with a serious issue in a bold way, and therefore deserves to be seen.Written and directed by Paul Haggis, who also penned the beautiful Million Dollar Baby, Crash shares its title with David Croneneberg's 1996 shocker, but contains none of the latter's sex-and-death imagery or themes. Instead, Haggis' work covers 36 hours of L.A. life, with various, totally different people who 'crash' into each other. They have nothing in common, except for the fact that in a way they're all racists. These people include a black cop (Don Cheadle), his 'Mexican' mistress (Jennifer Esposito), a DA (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (a surprising, serious, angry turn from Sandra Bullock), a shopkeeper from Iran, a thief (Ludicrous) and his pal, and others. Their problems range from Esposito making fun of a Chinese woman's accent but at the same time shunning whoever mocks her descent to Fraser finding it difficult to honor an Arabic law enforcer named Saddam (okay, maybe he's got a point there), though no one is as troubled as officer Ryan (the justly Oscar-nommed Matt Dillon), a man so unpleasant even his partner (Ryan Phillippe) feels uncomfortable working with him. The worst part is, Ryan's aware of this problem, but doesn't seem to care that much about it ('You don't like me, that's fine. I'm a pr*ck.'). Still, he proves everyone can change when he saves a colored woman (Thandie Newton), whom he was molesting earlier on in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), from the film's central accident.Crash has excellent, gripping performances (Dillon, Bullock and Howard shine above all), and that's what really keeps the movie together, especially in the epilogue where the script's weaknesses begin to emerge: as talented as he is, Haggis' decision to end his directorial debut with a string of coincidences is a partial disappointment. The bigger problem, however, is Ludicrous' character: with his erudite thoughts and philosophical reflections, he is just too artificial for a movie that aims to depict a realistic day in American citizens' lives. Aside from these flaws, though, Crash is a good, thought-provoking picture. Maybe not Best Picture of 2005, but interesting anyway.",8,1,8,12 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's ice-cold satire: brilliant, sharp and still relevant
","The best satires are those that, while related to a specific period, may be applied to the modern days as well. One such film is The Great Dictator, which was explicitly aimed at Hitler but also works as a mockery of every kind of dictatorship; another example is Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, a cold-war satire which has lost none of its power considering nuclear weapons still exist and, albeit less than in the past, constitute a threat to the planet's safety.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (one of the longest titles in history, but also one of the most poignant) is set in a dystopic reality where the conflict between USA and Soviet Union has reached disastrous proportions, leading the mad Gen. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) to believe the Russians have poisoned the American soldiers'water supplies, contaminating their 'bodily fluids' as he puts it, and orders an irrevocable attack on Sovietic soil: a series of nuclear devices will be dropped on the enemy's territory unless someone convinces Ripper of the insanity of his actions. This task is appointed to Capt. Mandrake (Peter Sellers), who desperately tries to reach President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) while trying to persuade the crazy general to end the nonsense he has started. Muffley, in the meantime, having learned of the situation, attempts to have a peaceful conversation with his Russian counterpart ('Well, Dimitri, one of our base commanders, he had a sort of... well, he went a little funny in the head... you know... just a little... funny') while his advisers, Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott) and the titular scientist (still Sellers), think of what to do to keep humanity alive, given the Bomb on hostile soil will trigger a device called the Doomsday Machine (the name says it all).The genius of Kubrick's masterpiece derives from the exaggeration of typically clichéd elements of other war movies: the officers' incompetence, the paranoid atmosphere, the soldiers' selfless bravery et al. All of these, especially the last one, flawlessly depicted by Texan Maj. 'King' Kong (Slim Pickens in what was meant to be Sellers' fourth role), are funny because, although overblown, they look real thanks to each character's seriousness and commitment to the job. All the physical comedy performed by Gen. Turgidson would have looked silly if he were played by the wrong actor, but Scott manages to make even the most ridiculous gesture an organic, necessary part of his role. The same goes for Hayden: what could easily have been a low-quality parody of war-related madness becomes in his hands a realistic depiction of paranoia and (extreme) patriotism.Neither of them, however, can match the brilliance and versatility of Sellers' triple act: the first (and one of the few) to get an Oscar nomination (Best Actor, more precisely) for playing multiple characters in the same movie, he successfully moves from pure slapstick (Strangelove) to typically British anxiety (Mandrake) and deadpan delivery (Muffley) without breaking a single sweat. Whether he is politely arguing with Hayden, discussing authority with Scott or struggling with his Nazi arm (one of cinema's most iconic images), he understands what will work in the right moment and shamelessly steals the whole picture. Without him, the film would not have been half as good as it is to this day, and that should be enough testament to his status as one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century.In short, a must-see comedy and essential viewing for fans of either Kubrick or Sellers. Hell, it's so good it even makes the expression 'Mein Fuhrer' raise laughs rather than cries of disgust.",10,7,15,23 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Fathers, sons and Ewoks...
","After the excellent Episode V, the original Star Wars trilogy comes to an end with a more children-friendly, yet still a bit tragic, third installment: after saving his friends from the revolting Jabba the Hutt, witnessing Yoda's death and learning new secrets about his origins from his deceased master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) prepares for the final confrontation with the Emperor and Darth Vader, aka Anakin Skywalker, the father he thought had died years before. He has a difficult choice to make: bring back his daddy or, in case that's impossible, kill him. In the meantime, the Rebels are getting ready for the ultimate battle against the Death Star, rebuilt after its destruction in the first film.The saga has lost none of its magic, as we approach the conclusion while still hoping it will go on some day.Now, let's talk about the one thing die-hard fans dislike about Return of the Jedi: the battle on planet Endor, more exactly the inhabitants of said planet, the teddy-bear like Ewoks (the originally planned Wookies were to expensive to achieve). They may have been created for business reasons rather than creative genius, and they may seem a little stupid since their technology ain't a touch on the rebels' or the Empire's. Still, they're cute and enjoyable, not to mention more memorable and better than a certain Jar Jar Binks...The Empire Strikes Back is the king, but Jedi is a worthy, though underrated, ending (?) for an amazing saga that began a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...9,5/10",9,1,3,17 November 2005
The Expendables," Long live the '80s!
","It is a well known fact that some big summer movies base their commercial appeal on whoever is playing the leading role. often emphasizing the star rather than the story. This is particularly true with The Expendables, an action movie where the plot is almost secondary to the cast list: Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote and directed the film), Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, even Arnold Schwarzenegger (distracted from his Governor duties for a few hours to make a cameo appearance).However, every movie needs a narrative to propel the action, so here's what The Expendables is all about: Barney Ross (Stallone) is the leader of the eponymous mercenary team, which comprises Li, Statham, Lundgren and Terry Crews, among others (Rourke is also involved, though in a more indirect way). Each team member has a specific skill, best employed in a series of dangerous, clandestine missions. One of them involves assassinating a South American dictator (David Zayas of Dexter fame) and his US ally (a rogue CIA operative played by Eric Roberts), who run a fictitious island with predictably cruel methods.This being a by-numbers action flick, albeit more violent than, say, The A-Team (however, the bloodletting is more amusing than shocking, thanks to Stallone's Tarantino-like approach), a ridiculously simple premise was to be expected. The downside is that Sly has clearly spent more time on casting than on structuring the film, meaning that individual scenes, deliberately written to suit the actors (and some roles were recast two or three times, requiring an equal number of rewrites), are the very definition of fun, whereas the movie as a whole suffers whenever the plot has to progress. Additionally, not everyone receives the same treatment: Crews and Andy Couture, for example, are stranded with quite irrelevant characters, perhaps due to their background not being related to acting, while the female players (Charisma Carpenter being one) are just wallpaper.That said, when Stallone gets it right, The Expendables really soars above expectations, as his cast of '80s 'washouts' (and new action poster-boy Statham) pay tribute to the genre's most glorious decade with genuine relish. In fact, the film's best moments are the ones where the stars make fun of themselves: whether it's Li and Lundgren arguing over who would win in a fistfight, Stallone and Statham debating the merits of old versus new or the former Rambo teaming up with Willis and Schwarzenegger (who makes his entrance à la Terminator) for the most geek-friendly scene of the year, everyone knows they're not supposed to take any of it seriously, and that makes for a better film.Overall, The Expendables is something of a mixed bag: not really the sum of its parts, but entertaining enough to justify a sequel which, according to early reports and fan-boy wishes, will try to make room for Jean-Claude van Damme and Chuck Norris. Now, how's that for hype?",7,3,7,19 September 2010
Scary Movie 2," Eminently forgettable
","The first 10 minutes of this film are mildly amusing. Not painstakingly hilarious, just amusing. But considering the rest of the movie is completely laugh-free, 'amusing' is good enough.After the opening Exorcist spoof (enjoyable thanks to James Woods parodying Max Von Sydow), Scary Movie 2 fails to make its audience smile even once, despite the presence of people like Tim Curry and David Cross (priceless in Arrested Development, boring as hell is this film). Curry and Cross are studying supernatural phenomenons, which supposedly take place in a 'haunted house'. In order to succeed with their experiment, they decide to use a group of teenagers (those who didn't die in the previous installment) as baits. You can easily guess what's gonna happen next.The first Scary Movie wasn't very memorable, but it had some good moments under the crude, puerile surface. The sequel, disappointingly, is just surface. All gags involve sex and drugs, drugs and sex, in what becomes a marathon of increasingly embarrassing jokes. The characters are one-dimensional and dull, and the actors do absolutely nothing to add more flesh to the unappealing bones. The whole film is so ridiculous I didn't even mind to point out a blatant continuity mistake (how can Brenda and Ray be in this movie when they were killed in the first flick?).Final verdict: haven't seen this picture? Then don't. Watch Scary Movie 3 and 4 directly instead.3,5/10",4,4,9,12 November 2006
Knocked Up," A surprisingly effective mix of sweetness and crudity
","On paper, Knocked Up didn't sound like a great project. The finished product, on the other hand, manages, similarly to director Judd Apatow's previous film, The 40-Year Old Virgin, to transcend its puerile concept and become a comedy that entertains and moves in equal measure.The leading role is played by Seth Rogen, who famously said to Steve Carell (who appears as himself in a very irreverent, amusing scene) in Virgin: 'I am ugly as f*ck by traditional standards, but, I get with women.'. His character in Knocked Up, Ben Stone, might agree with the first part of the statement, but certainly not with the second: in fact, he's been so obsessed with fulfilling his dream (he and his pals are working on a website which can tell you exactly at what point and for how long a famous actor or actress is naked in a movie) he hasn't even seen a woman in ages. Imagine his surprise, then, when he goes out for a drink and runs into Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), a TV camerawoman who is about to get a promotion, and she accepts to spend the night with him. Only problem is, Ben's excessive eagerness leads him to misinterpret his partner's instructions about a condom, meaning that eight weeks later he gets a phone call from Alison who is in the titular condition and forces him to face his responsibilities.So far, so typical. But just like Kevin Smith, Apatow has a rare gift: he can alternate moments of pure crudity and reflections on deeper subjects without making the picture seem uneven. For every scene where Ben and his friends discuss things using extremely colorful expressions, there is a touching glimpse of the crisis that is going on between Alison's sister, played by the director's real-life wife Leslie Mann, and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd), whose bleak description of his feelings is worthy of Woody Allen: 'Marriage is like a tense, unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond, only it doesn't last 22 minutes. It lasts forever.'. Beyond the American Pie-style premise (albeit a more realistic one than that of Virgin) lies a daring, but also very funny, analysis of love, commitment, aging and the fear of remaining alone. Not bad for a filmmaker whose breakthrough feature had a tag-line that said 'The longer you wait, the harder it gets' (Knocked Up's is even cheekier: 'A one-night stand to end all others').As with The 40-Year Old Virgin, much of the fun derives from the cast: though it is unlikely he will be cast in more serious or mature roles, as was the case with Carell (Little Miss Sunshine), Rogen is a valuable addition to the new wave of emerging American comedians; Rudd develops the darker side he started showing in Virgin, confirming his status as a reliable dramatic counterpoint to the slapstick in Apatow's films, and his chemistry with Mann adds to their scenes' poignancy; and Heigl, best known for Grey's Anatomy, could easily become the new Cameron Diaz, using her looks but not depending on them (something that was actually discussed in an episode of Grey's) and proving, much more effectively than Reese Witherspoon, that not all blondes necessarily have to be stupid on camera, her performance being one of the smartest ever given by a female lead in a mainstream comedy.Ironically, the movie's only weakness is also shared with its predecessor: the running time. The film is never actually boring, but 129 minutes is a little too much even for something as funny as this, and there are a few scenes (the Vegas bit and the celebrity cameo montage most of all) that would have been better had they been shortened a bit. Overall, though, Knocked Up is the year's best US comedy so far, and further confirmation of the fact that Judd Apatow is a name that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Mel Brooks or Kevin Smith.",8,0,2,17 August 2007
Alien," Arguably the most satisfying combination of science-fiction and horror in the history of cinema
","Almost thirty years have passed since Alien made its first appearance, becoming an instant classic, opening the doors of Hollywood to director Ridley Scott and starting one of the best-known franchises to have ever graced the screen. Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.Of course, by now everyone knows what the alien looks like, but when he inadvertently started the series Scott made the wise decision of keeping it mostly unseen: the ghastly creature is almost never shown in its entirety, preferring to lurk in the shadows as the unaware human characters gradually realize what's happening. In fact, the first half-hour or so of the film is spent to introduce the protagonists and get a better understanding of their relationship, which, as in many other similarly themed movies, is tense. Justifiably, since the nine astronauts have been together on the Nostromo for a lot of time, sent on a mission in outer space by a mysterious Company. Suddenly, they receive a distress signal from a remote planet and decide to take a better look at what's going on. Within hours, they will regret it. Hopefully, the people watching this film won't.Some parts of the movie could be dismissed as clichés, but the truth is, of course, that Alien actually CREATED many of the stereotypes of recent sci-fi (crew being wiped out from within, no one out there to help them, et cetera). Plus, the film is so solid and consistently captivating it is hard to stop and think of possible leaks in the plot. As a pure exercise is suspense and horror, Alien has no rivals, Scott's clever use of lighting and camera angles ensuring the claustrophobia and tension never drop. He is also helped in this by choosing to keep the villainous creature in the dark most of the time, perfectly adhering to the old principle of 'the less you show, the better' (something Spielberg and Carpenter applied with equal success on Jaws and Halloween). And while the characters may have been developed better in the sequels, what we have here is enough to qualify as convincing and likable, thanks mainly to a spot-on cast: Sigourney Weaver, a complete unknown at the time, is mesmerizing in the role that made her an A-lister and finally put an end to the Hollywood tradition of women being no good other than when it comes to running and screaming. The supporting cast is every bit as strong, with John Hurt (who is the unsung hero of the entire franchise's most celebrated sequence) and Ian Holm in particular adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere.Briefly, one of the Top 10 greatest science-fiction/horror (it fits equally well on either list) films ever, and, Blade Runner and Gladiator aside, the high point of Ridley Scott's career. Just remember: on Earth, people CAN hear you scream...",10,5,10,12 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," He feels pretty and witty and insane...
","A story involving revenge, 19th Century London (wonderfully reconstructed by Italian production designer Dante Ferretti), madness, cannibalism and repeated throat-cutting - is it any wonder Gothic maestro Tim Burton fell in love with Stephen Sondheim's politically incorrect musical right off the bat? In fact, who else but the visionary who gave us Batman and Sleepy Hollow could have done this gory tale justice? That said, is Sweeney Todd Burton's best film? Not quite. And it isn't his greatest collaboration with Johnny Depp either: both titles are still shared by the combined magic of Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. It does, however, rank a close second on either list: such is the visual, aural and emotional power of the tragic, violent love-story-cum-horror-movie.The mood of the picture is elegantly set in the opening credits, made in typical Burton fashion: company logos (Dreamworks and Warner) set to dramatic music (no Danny Elfman, though: all the tunes heard in the movie are Sondheim's creation) and the camera following a productive process inside a building. Imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with added blood, and there's the intro, followed by Todd's (Johnny Depp) return to London after 15 years of incarceration. Not that he's very happy to be back: he calls the city 'a big black pit filled with people who are filled with sh*t', a description that is hard to dismiss, given the bleak weather and bleaker houses. One of the latter used to contain Sweeney's barbershop, but is now the home of Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who earns her living by making 'The Worst Meat Pies in London'. She recognizes Todd as Benjamin Barker, a successful barber who was imprisoned so that the sleazy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) could freely seduce his wife and raise his daughter. Now, with the missus dead and the girl in Turpin's grasp, the grief-stricken man has only one thing on his mind: revenge, even if that means murdering innocent people along the road. From that simple idea stems a sinister plan, one that will appease Todd's lust for blood and improve his accomplice's business.Given the director's previous trips in musical areas (The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride), one might expect a similar lightness of touch in Sweeney Todd. Nothing further from the truth: if there's one thing that makes Burton a genius, it's his ability to understand what works and what doesn't in a specific kind of movie. Back in 1989, he justified his take on the Dark Knight by saying: 'If you want to do it bright and light you either do Superman or Cotton Candy Man, you don't do Batman!'. His vision of the Demon Barber is backed by the same frankness: 'I had seen several stage productions where they toned down the blood, but you can't be politically correct with this: it's a story about a serial killer and they cook people in pies.'. And there is no correctness in the feature: gallows humor of the blackest kind, implications of rape and child abuse, and gallons of blood - whereas Sleepy Hollow's decapitations were frequent but anemic, Sweeney Todd's succession of deaths doesn't hold back the red bodily fluid.Of course, with such a subject, chances are viewers might fail to root for the twisted characters. Burton solves the problem thanks to the songs: in most musicals, they are merely a distraction from the plot; this time, they are integral to the story's human core, as they are used by the cast to convey a complex range of emotions that are hard to express with normal words. Every single actor (including Sacha Baron Cohen as an Italian barber) masters Sondheim's lyrics with unusual grace (then again, the author had the final word on the director's casting choices), and they all use the music to transcend the two-dimensional prison their characters would otherwise be locked up in. Rickman, in particular, gives Turpin an additional majestic feel besides the sheer menace he has carried around since Die Hard, while Bonham Carter proves she wasn't chosen because she is Burton's sweetheart: there's real passion and suffering beneath Mrs. Lovett's insanity, as a beautiful dream sequence (the only moment in the whole film to contain sunlight) testifies. But it is Depp who, as expected, delivers the most impressive performance, for which he won his first Golden Globe and received his third Academy Award nomination: 'barking mad', as his partner describes him, while he sings 'My Friends' (referred to the razors) and painfully tender in his rendition of 'Johanna' (a song concerning Todd's daughter), he paints a layered, immensely compelling portrait of a man wronged for no reason and driven mad by loss. In addition, fans will probably love the Scissorhands joke ('At last, my arm is complete again!').Sure, some people might find the concept disgusting. Some will be turned off by the blood-letting. But by finding the humanity of the characters and using the musical numbers to tell the gory story of Sweeney Todd, Burton has made a spellbinding film that will, in due time, be considered a classic of the genre.",9,2,5,24 February 2008
Closer," Love has never been more painful.
","I'd read only three positive reviews before I saw this movie,and I still don't understand why people hated it.Okay,the language is quite explicit,and it may be shocking to hear it from actors we don't expect to be foul-mouthed in movies(I don't think anyone would have complained about the profanity if Joe Pesci had been in the film),but when you're dealing with such subjects as love,sex and couples being destroyed,and you really want to show their pain or,as in the case of Clive Owen's character,their determination to win the war,sometimes colorful language is necessary.A part from that,this movie is really heartbreaking,as director Mike Nichols (an expert in odd relationship-dramas)and screenwriter Patrick Marber,who also wrote the play this movie is based on,narrate a 'war' between two couples,who are determined to obtain what they want,no matter what sacrifices might be necessary.Marber's dialogue is gripping and believable,and it does actually provide some laughs (the highlight is the on line-sex between Jude Law and Clive Owen),although the movie is actually a great tragedy.The script is also complex,as it moves from month to month and year to year and almost never fills the gaps(you have to listen to the characters in order to understand what happened).As for the actors,Jude Law and Julia Roberts are very good,but they're hugely overshadowed by Natalie Portman,who is really impressive as a stripper who actually only wants to be loved,and Clive Owen,quite simply OUTSTANDING as merciless dermatologist Larry.Not even his portrayal of Dwight McCarthy (from Sin City) can match the energy,passion and rage(or brutality)he displays in this incredibly compelling film,strangely overlooked by some critics and by the Academy.This movie is one of the best of 2004 and also an excellent choice for those who don't like big-budget,effects-heavy films.Not recommended if you believe in happy endings.",9,3,5,11 August 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Better than 12, that's for sure!
","In all fairness, Ocean's Twelve wasn't that bad: it was slick, well acted and fun, although it was evident that the script had been put together as an excuse for Clooney et al to have fun in Europe for a couple of months, the result being a bit of a mess. Thankfully, Ocean's Thirteen is better: there's only one job, we're back in Vegas and there are no ridiculous contrivances (well, maybe one or two, but the movie is too damn enjoyable for the audience to start questioning the logic).Most importantly, though, the premise is much more interesting: whereas in Twelve the gang pulled off a series of heists in order to survive, this time round they are driven by revenge. The victim is Willy Bank (Al Pacino), a sleazy hotel owner who has put Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), one of the original eleven, out of business, causing him a heart attack. Because of this, Danny (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), Linus (Matt Damon) and the others (minus Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who are left out since 'it's not their fight') decide to get back at Bank by ruining the opening of his newest hotel/casino, only given the target (there's a virtually invincible security system, called Greco) they are going to need some extra help in the shape of Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), whose loyalty is questionable to say the least. But with the clock ticking and a dozen of things that could go wrong, he is probably the last person to worry about.Being back in Vegas really ensures director Steven Soderbergh and his cast are able to feel at home: the camera movements, the editing and the performances are more confident and less smug (in a good way, of course) than they were in the previous film, which however does not mean there isn't time for an in-joke or two (Damon's fake nose being the standout). The plotting is as ingenious as in Ocean's Eleven, although the writers make a huge mistake explaining every single step of the procedure in the first thirty minutes: after a while, it just becomes too much for any viewer to pay attention to. It is all compensated by the following hour and a half: the wit is as sharp as ever, the set-pieces are brilliant and visually delightful, and all thirteen cast members get their moment in the spotlight (among the 'minor' players, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan are the most memorable), Damon in particular completing the transformation he went through in the first two movies, turning Linus from a nervous learner to a con-man worthy of the name. And what about Pacino? Most of the pre-release hype focused on him, and it has to be said that it was fully justified: the former Michael Corleone is one hell of a villain. Sure, he does get excellent support from Ellen Barkin, but if it weren't for the combined effort of Clooney, Pitt and Damon he would walk away with the entire movie, fearless, proud and merciless (the scene where he squares off with the leading man has to be his best moment in years).So, to sum it all up: Eleven - near flawless; Twelve - amusing but a bit uneven; Thirteen - not exactly on par with the first one, but worth your money nonetheless.",8,1,4,18 June 2007
Barry Lyndon," A damn fine period piece, carried by a charismatic Ryan O' Neal
","Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray is, reportedly, the first novel in the English language to feature an anti-hero. Stanley Kubrick's film version retains that aspect to perfection, thus becoming a slightly different period drama from what we are used to.The main character is an Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O' Neal), a con artist who, after killing a rival in a duel, starts traveling around Europe looking for wealth and power. With his charm and ability with words he manages to eventually rise to the upper classes by marrying the recently widowed Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), even though said marriage is far from happy, due to Barry's most annoying talent, that of bringing misery and ruin wherever he goes.Given his perfectionistic reputation, the words 'Kubrick' and 'period piece' must have sounded like a magical combination, and indeed it is: the Clockwork Orange director handles every technical aspect of the film with absolute professionalism, from the candle-lit cinematography to the astonishing costumes to the marvelous production design (all of which were given Academy Awards), ensuring one element everyone remembers about this kind of film (the visual seductiveness) is pitch-perfect.The other classic ingredient in costume dramas is a touching love story, but that is not something Kubrick would have told, fond as he was of tales of solitude, unhappiness and destruction. The first is a characteristic of Barry, the other two are what he has a habit of causing: as noble as his intentions may be (and they rarely are) and no matter how close he gets to the right people, he is doomed to remain alone, his own wife being unable to accept his opportunistic schemes. Nevertheless, there is a kind of smugness (in a good way) to him that makes him less unlikable than expected, and O' Neal's charismatic performance (complete with decent accent) keeps the character away from anything resembling a one-dimensional caricature of the average con-man, providing a lightness of touch which saves the film from becoming too bleak during its long running time (almost three hours).Last, but not least, Barry Lyndon would not be half as good without the classical music used as soundtrack, each melancholic tone proving a perfect companion to the humorous but fundamentally sad tale of (lost) love, power and abandon.A must-see for fans of period pieces, Lyndon is also unusual by Kubrick's standards, its lighter tone being a neat counterbalance to the darker subjects the director explored in Paths of Glory, The Killing and A Clockwork Orange. Yes, it is very long. Yes, it requires multiple viewings to be fully understood, just like every other Kubrick movie. But it is also, like all of the notorious perfectionist's pictures, infinitely rewarding and considerably less unsettling than his more famous works.",10,3,6,24 July 2007
Full Metal Jacket," This film neither blows nor sucks: it punches the viewer right in the gut
","'In Vietnam the wind doesn't blow, it sucks'. This not-so-subtle tag-line (which actually led to some posters being censored in Canada) was used to advertise one of the most brutal war films ever made, one that still resonates with rage and gravitas: Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers, the movie can be distinctly divided in two sections. The first one takes place on Perris Island, a boot camp facility where newly recruited Marines are trained before going to fight in Vietnam. It is a brutal training, its aim being solely to turn innocent men into killing machines, and the lifelessness these soldiers are moving towards is evident from the opening sequence, where they all get their heads shaved without as much as blinking. That, however, is nothing compared to how they must put up with their instructor's foul-mouthed orders: Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is one of the scariest film characters of all time, his verbal abuse of every single soldier, especially an obese kid he renames Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), being much worse than anything they could possibly experience in Asia.This point is proved in the movie's second half, entirely set in the 'Nam, where Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), having completed his training, leads the rest of the unit in a series of bloody missions, behaving in a way that openly contradicts the nickname he was given by Hartman.Kubrick made another war movie at the beginning of his career, and though Paths of Glory (1957) resembles FMJ in its open anti-militaristic position, those two films couldn't be more different: the WWI drama dealt with the injustice of war that takes place outside the battlefield, while Jacket explores the effect of conflicts on the human psyche. In fact, it can be said that the film's analysis of mental distortion is a sort of expansion of themes previously covered in A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, the director's almost morbid passion for humanity's downfall being at its most explicit in those features (there are also echoes of 2001 in the legendary bathroom scene, HAL's actions being mirrored by one of the soldiers).Strangely, though, the build-up turns out to be more shocking and memorable than the pay-off, the Vietnam section clearly suffering from Ermey's absence. The most frightening thing about his performance is of course the fact that he isn't acting: a real Marines instructor who was hired as a consultant for the picture's first half, Ermey was so committed to the job Kubrick hired him on the spot. It is not hard to see why: there aren't that many actors who could be able to shout obscenities the way he does, relentlessly, without ever repeating himself or hesitating (that he also improvised a large part, perhaps even all, of his dialogue adds to the character's iconic status). Thus, how powerful and unflinching it may be, the movie feels a little weak once he's out of the picture (pun not intended). Also impressive is D'Onofrio: best known for Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Men in Black, his portrayal of the miserable, incredibly overweight Pyle (the actor reportedly gained so much weight he actually injured himself during the shoot because he was too heavy) is among the most gripping ever seen in any film, especially when Hartman's violent methods start ripping out his humanity.Apocalypse Now is a great film for its seemingly mythological take on the Vietnam war; Platoon is a milestone because it shows the conflict exactly as it was, unfiltered and brutal; as for Full Metal Jacket, it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath for showing that not all insanity starts in the war zone: sometimes it is woken up earlier, by our very own fellow countrymen.9,5/10",10,2,6,26 July 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," A sharp, poignant comedy, driven by a terrific script and a towering central performance by Meryl Streep
","Meryl Streep has a wonderful gift: she is one of the few people in the world who can take any role in any movie and play it to perfection. And even though she's best known for dramatic parts (Kramer vs. Kramer, Sophie's Choice, The Deer Hunter), she can shine in comedies as well. The latest example is The Devil Wears Prada, where she delivers another Oscar-worthy turn.She plays Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway, one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in America, and is famous for her tyrannical attitude and continuous demands. Unfortunately, her new secretary, Andrea 'Andy' Sachs (Anne Hathaway), doesn't know this when she first sets foot in the office. Once there, though, it doesn't take her long to realize that working for Miranda will turn out to be a nightmare. Especially if you're a naive young girl who knows absolutely nothing about fashion...Andy has to face the truth: she's a fish out of water in this world where a size 6 (hers) is the new 14, everyone wears clothes they don't even like, as long as it's expensive and gorgeous, and the high point of the year is going to Paris and meet all the big personalities. As for our 'ugly duckling', she really struggles to fit into that universe, with some support from Miranda's gay assistant Nigel (Stanley Tucci, absolutely hilarious) providing comfort between the impossible assignments, whether it's finding a manuscript of Harry Potter 7 for her boss's twins or booking a private flight when all regular airlines are blocked by a storm.First-time director David Frankel (who previously worked on Sex and the City) approaches the fashion world with a poignant eye, showing it for what it really is: populated by cynicism and appearances, with just an occasional glimpse of unexpected humanity surfacing here and there. Instead of pandering to mainstream rules, Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna keep the movie mean, and therefore relentlessly fun, until the end. By doing that, they provide us with one of the year's best comedies, given increased value by some deliciously quotable dialogue ('...You have no sense of fashion..' 'I think that depends on...' 'No, no, that wasn't a question') and memorable acting: Hathaway manages to gain the audience's sympathy thanks to her simple charm and unpretentious behavior, while Tucci turns what could have been an annoying stereotype into a likable, genuinely amusing supporting character, yet they're both second to Streep's impeccable, mesmerizing work. If the film's great, it's largely due to her.Want to see something truly, undeniably funny this year? Make it Clerks II. Something less risky and profane? Then watch The Devil Wears Prada.",8,0,0,23 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Luckily, not a clone of its predecessor
","O.K., it's better than Episode I.George Lucas has realized what people want in a Star Wars movie,so he has reduced Jar Jar's screen time,focusing instead on the beginning of the Clone Wars and the romance between Anakin and Padmè.Actually,the love story is the least interesting part,due to so-so dialogue and Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin as a whining teenager.Come on,it's the future Darth Vader we're talking about! Nevertheless,Christensen manages to hint the fun will begin in the following episode,and John Williams's love theme 'Across the Stars' is worth listening to.Now,let's get to the good stuff.Ewan Mcgregor has improved since TPM,and so has Samuel L. Jackson,who even gets to do some sword-fighting in a Gladiator-style sequence.The real treat,however,is the villain:Count Dooku,played by Hollywood's nr 1 bad guy,Christopher Lee.Much more charismatic than Darth Maul,the mysterious Count is what makes this movie really great.Just watch the amazing light-saber duel with Yoda!Suggestion:if you haven't seen Episode I yet, skip it and go directly to this one,while waiting for the dramatic conclusion...",7,1,3,21 September 2005
Corpse Bride," It's a Wonderful Death
","In 1993, Tim Burton changed the rules of animated cinema with The Nightmare Before Christmas, a dark, moving, wonderful 'toon musical.Twelve years later, he repeats the miracle with Corpse Bride(co-directed with Mike Johnson), another dark, moving, wonderful 'toon musical.The movie features Victor Van Dort(Johnny Depp), a young man who, despite being engaged to Victoria Everglot(Emily Watson), accidentally ends up marrying a Corpse Bride(Helena Bonham Carter).And that's just the beginning of a new exciting tour through Burton's original visions, which completely subvert the usual stereotypes about life and death:our world is pretty grey and monotonous, while in the underworld corpses and skeletons spend their endless time singing and dancing all night long(Danny Elfman's score and songs are not as memorable as the ones he composed for Nightmare, but still quite fascinating).Poetic, touching, funny and visually stunning, this film proves Burton has lost none of his talent and creativity.The vocal cast, including the director's regulars Albert Finney, Michael Gough, Christopher Lee and Deep Roy, not to mention the leading couple, is excellent, and some of them(Depp, Gough and Bonham Carter) are so good you end up feeling you're actually watching those actors, not just hearing their voices.Perhaps the best movie I've seen this year, at least for the moment.Everybody should see this as soon as they have the opportunity:Tim Burton's wonderland never stops satisfying the audience...",10,1,3,1 November 2005
The Godfather: Part II," This is a sequel that demands respect!
","After the huge success of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo go on with narrating the history of the Corleone family. It picks up right where we left it: Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in America. Soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. Apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (Robert Duvall) he can't trust anyone ('Keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer'), including his own brother Fredo (John Cazale). Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore.As we witness Michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, it's the same Vito Corleone who made 'offers you can't refuse' in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. It's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the 'best' way to achieve something under specific circumstances.Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. The screenplay is flawless, Coppola and Puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family that's ever shown up on a screen.The family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the director's father, Carmine Coppola, helps Nino Rota with the superb, tragic score.But let's not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the Corleones memorable: Pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside Scarface's Tony Montana, while Duvall, Cazale and Talia Shire (not to mention James Caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. Yet there's one guy who tops all of them, the only one I haven't mentioned so far: Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for playing the young Vito Corleone. It's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): De Niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. It's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.Before The Godfather: Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies. I can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and you'll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time.",10,5,7,15 March 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimatum is the ultimate spy story: the year's most satisfying thriller
","In 2002, The Bourne Identity gave the action/thriller genre the shot in the arm it so desperately needed. In 2004, The Bourne Supremacy improved on that, standing out as one of the boldest, most interesting spy films ever made. And now, with The Bourne Ultimatum, the year's best threequel, the trilogy ends triumphantly.Set six weeks after the Moscow showdown at the end of Supremacy (the final scene, where the amnesiac hit-man learns some vital information, is actually part of Ultimatum's narrative), the film shows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the run once again: even though he contributed to bringing down double agent Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), the CIA director is still convinced he is a threat, with only Pamela Landy thinking otherwise. Things don't get much better when a British reporter (Paddy Considine) writes an article about Bourne and several illegal operations, prompting counter-terror officer Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) to initiate a manhunt that will take the hero (and the viewer) across the globe and closer to the truth, as Bourne starts to remember things and realizes his only choice is to find out the definitive truth about his mysterious past.Roger Ebert cleverly pointed out that in five years and three movies the quest for the truth has almost become, like Hitchcock would say, a MacGuffin, an excuse for the protagonist to run for his life and kick villainous butt in increasingly breathtaking set-pieces. He has a point, as director Paul Greengrass, whose hand-held, edgy approach made The Bourne Supremacy a unique summer blockbuster, ensures the adrenaline level stays sky-high for the entire duration of the film: The Bourne Ultimatum has more action than the first two movies combined, 75% of the picture containing the most inventive chases or fights (hardback book as a weapon, anyone?) since, well, the previous Bourne outing, and it is a real pleasure to watch Damon, who now wears the role as if it were a tailored suit, take the character to new extremes.This doesn't mean the plot is sacrificed in favor of the style, though: the script is solid and intelligent, the traditional intrigue element being treated in a new way and allowing Damon's co-stars (the ambiguous Strathairn and scene-stealing Albert Finney most of all) to play their parts in a three-dimensional way that is unheard of in most action flicks. Heck, the movie is even audacious enough to reuse the second film's ending and give it a whole new meaning, proving once again the Bourne franchise is a lot of steps ahead of average genre pictures.And that's without mentioning the brilliant conclusion: having revealed only what is strictly necessary, Greengrass exposes all his genius in the last images which, while hinting at a possible Bourne Legacy (unlikely, but possible), represent the perfect closure of a series that has raised the bar for action films for many years to come.",10,1,2,9 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," A superior teen comedy
","'Teen comedy' and Shakespeare: two concepts that shouldn't fit very well in the same sentence, especially if the former turns out to be an adaptation of a work by the latter, set in the present day. Thankfully, the writers of this film get it right most of the time, which is why 10 Things I Hate About You should be rightfully considered one of the more interesting interpretations of the Bard's works.One of the smartest moves on the makers' behalf is actually the choice not to reveal the origin of the story: Shakespeare's name isn't mentioned anywhere in the credits. Instead, we get a few playful and fun references to the original author and the comedy The Taming of the Shrew, on which 10 Things is loosely based: the high school where most of the action unfolds is called Padua (the city where The Taming takes place), the female protagonist's last name is Stratford (Shakespeare's place of birth) and the male main character is named Verona, after the town where Romeo & Juliet was set.Instead of two ill-fated lovers, we have two people who can't stand each other: Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles), the 'shrew' who refuses to socialize with anyone, and Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), an Australian textbook rebel who allegedly served jail time for setting a cop on fire. Thw two are brought together thanks to the actions of a younger boy, Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a crush on Kat's sister Bianca (Marisa Oleynik). Unfortunately for him, her father (Larry Miller) won't let her date guys until Kat dates someone as well, and since no one will spontaneously go out with Kat, Cameron and is friend Michael (David Krumholtz) come up with the idea of paying Patrick to ensure everyone gets their happy ending.Naturally, as in all rom-coms starring teenagers, things get a little more complicated than that, and so the entire third act is about how everyone screws up and has to fix the mess they caused. It's all quite predictable, but that doesn't lessen the movie's appeal: sure, it'a very traditional genre comedy, but it's executed with wit and pace, both delivered by sparkling dialogue and above-average performances. Stiles, best known for more troubled roles, pulls off the difficult task of making Kat sympathetic in spite of her apparent coldness, while Ledger, in the part that got him noticed in Hollywood, goes beyond a mere 'brooding thug' clichè. So much of the movie is in their hands one wishes there was less focus on Gordon-Levitt and Oleynik, who might provide the tools for setting the story in motion, but also happen to be incredibly daft compared to the main couple and constitute the film's biggest flaw (paired with an embarrassing paint-ball scene). Fortunately, that kind of blandness is compensated by a terrific adult cast, most notably Miller (familiar to Seinfeld fans) and Allison Janney, whose two-scene cameo easily qualifies as the best laugh in the whole picture.To summarize, romantic comedies aren't always that good, especially when teenagers are part of the main plot, but when they work, the result can be something as warm and funny as 10 Things I Hate About You. Then again, the Shakespearean roots of the screenplay must have helped a great deal too.",8,1,1,14 June 2008
Fargo," The Coens' top achievement
","I have a tendency not to compare the Coen brothers to other directors, seeing as they are among the most unique filmmakers in the world, but it is fair to say Fargo is their Pulp Fiction: a work of startling originality (in fact, their first truly original screenplay, rewarded with an Oscar) that showed they could do more than merely revisit classic genres, so brilliant the Academy chose to overlook it (the Best Picture award for 1996 was infamously given to The English Patient). It's a playful, exhilarating and shocking piece of cinema - the brothers' masterpiece.The film's playfulness is exposed in the very beginning, as the opening caption states 'This is a true story' (which, of course, it isn't). After that, it's straight into the action: three men talking in a diner. One of them is Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car dealer whose financial troubles have led him to the hiring of the other two, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). They are meant to kidnap Jerry's wife and ask his father-in-law Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom which will be split in half between crooks and employer. However, just like in Reservoir Dogs (which also starred Buscemi), the best laid plans get screwed up beyond belief, resulting in a bloodbath that contrasts nicely with the snowy surroundings.While Carl and Gaear keep getting in trouble and Jerry has to pretend everything is all right, the cops intervene as well; specifically, one cop, Marge Gunderson (the Oscar-winning Frances McDormand, aka Mrs. Joel Coen), whose natural kindness and determination make her the ideal choice for the job despite her being eight months pregnant.Marge is one of the best film characters of the '90s, and undoubtedly the Coens' finest creation: whereas the protagonists of their previous movies were clever reinterpretations of genre types, she is a flesh-and-blood human being, with real emotions and a heart of gold. Her unique status as the only really good person in the film adds to the several endearing traits of McDormand's humane, warm performance. She is the audience's guide in a darkly humorous universe, populated by dishonest con-men, funny-talking prostitutes (the accents are supposedly of Scandinavian origin) and the psychotic Gaear, played by a career-best Stormare, whose double act with the fast-talking Buscemi adds to the in-joking since he is the only real Scandinavian in a movie full of fake Swedes and Danes (Lundegaard and Gustafson).The unique setting of the film (apparently, the Coens' home region) plays really well to the brothers' knack for funny names (apart from the ones that have already been mentioned, one should remember that of Marge's husband, Norm 'Son of a' Gunderson), quirky characters and sudden, brutal violence. The result is a once-in-a-lifetime blend of thriller, comedy and horror movie, the best film of 1996 and a milestone in (post)modern film-making. It may not be a true story, but why nag about that when the Coens' imagination is much more satisfying?",10,0,0,15 August 2008
The Aviator," A stunning combination of madness and genius
","That Howard Hughes certainly was a particular individual: billionaire, filmmaker, engineer, aviator (as the title reminds us), ladies'man, but also an eccentric sociopath who wouldn't even open a door if someone else had touched it first. Not a bad subject for a movie, and Martin Scorsese decided to accept that challenge. And frankly, why not? This film was an excuse to bring Hollywood's glory years back, those years the director is so fond of, the period in which most of The Aviator is set. And let's not forget one of the movie's key themes, obsession, something Scorsese knows quite well (it took him almost 20 years to make The Last Temptation of Christ and 30 to do Gangs of New York).The first half of the film is the best one, as we witness Hughes'(Leonardo Di Caprio) first important battle: the one he fought to complete Hell's Angels, which was the most expensive picture of its time. When he's not shooting said war flick, he spends his time as any other wealthy guy: dating movie stars. The focus is on his relationship with Katharine Hepburn (a picture-perfect Cate Blanchett), although we're also granted glimpses of his affairs with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani). Through these acquaintances, we even get to see a different side of show business, namely what famous actors do off camera (Jude Law is tremendously fun as a drunk, all but heroic Errol Flynn).After that, serious trouble begins: Hughes' various manias start to increase and get worse, making him more and more alone, with nothing but his money and his extreme ambitions to keep him company (that's probably why The Aviator is called 'Scorsese's Citizen Kane'). And he's gonna need that money, since his airline might get thrown out of business, courtesy of a group of people led by Pan Am boss Juan Trippe (an impressive Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt US senator (the justly Oscar-nominated Alan Alda).Ultimately, it's a film about power and the war fought to keep that power, as well as the struggles we have to face in order to make our dreams come true. And in Leo Di Caprio, Scorsese has found a man capable of successfully portray the incarnation of innocence, enthusiasm, genius and pure madness, all in the same person. While in Gangs of New York he was second to Daniel Day-Lewis, this time the former Titanic star has the chance to shine on his own, and impress us he does, particularly when his eccentric billionaire starts losing it completely. Shame the two didn't venture more into what drew the crazy man, but The Aviator nonetheless remains a compelling, epic story.Love classic American movies? You'll love this one, too.",9,2,3,17 December 2005
Burn After Reading," Central Idiots Agency
","The Coen brothers' filmography appears to follow a cyclical pattern: in 1998, after winning the Best Screenplay Oscar for Fargo, they released that piece of cult insanity known as The Big Lebowski. Ten years later, courtesy of their recent Oscar success with the stunning No Country for Old Men, comes Burn After Reading, another piece of zany, irresistible madness. On one level, it is also a perfect companion piece to their previous film, showing once again that America really is, forgive the expression, no country for old men. Especially the ones in suits and specs who trade secrets.One such man is Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), a bad-tempered CIA analyst who is fired for having a drinking problem. Since he all of a sudden has a lot of free time, he thinks an appropriate way to spend it would be writing a memoir, much to the chagrin of his uptight wife Katie (Tilda Swinton). Unfortunately, the disk containing a small part of his remembrances is found on the floor of a gym locker. The manager (Richard Jenkins) wants nothing to do with it, whereas Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand), desperate to have a series of surgeries to look better, and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt), a fitness-obsessed doofus, see it as an opportunity to make some easy money. While the two try to carry out their bizarre blackmail attempt, Linda gets involved with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a Treasury employee who is also sleeping with Mrs. Cox. Needless to say, there will be chaos, hilarity and the occasional squirt of blood.The magic of Burn After Reading lies in how Joel and Ethan Coen approach their satirical handling of all things spook-related: instead of hitting the full parody mode, à la Austin Powers or Johnny English (in which, coincidentally, Malkovich played the villain), they envision a pretty generic spy story (their inspiration, or so they claim at least, was The Bourne Identity) and then just pinpoint the natural absurdity of these scenarios, especially the major coincidence of all the people involved being connected somehow, leading to everyone being paranoid about everything (the classic 'walk in the park scene' is a must-see) and a clueless CIA director (J.K. Simmons) wondering what the hell is going on. That's actually the big message the Coens deliver: most of the time, even secret agents have no clue of what they're doing.The dialogue is, as always with these writers/directors, comedy gold, from Harry's priceless rendition of something as simple as 'Well, hello!' to Chad's blackmail phone call ('Osborne Cox? I thought you might be worried... about the security... of your sh*t!'), and all those classy lines are served to perfection by one of the most committed ensemble casts the Coens have ever assembled: regular players like Clooney (partially spoofing his Oscar-winning role in Syriana), McDormand (a brilliant self-referential performance) and Simmons know what to do and comply hilariously, while Swinton, the new girl on the block, uses all her scenes to the max in her reinterpretation of a 'cold, stuck-up b*tch'. And then we have Pitt and Malkovich, who need a separate mention: the former, dim and proud of it (with a laughable Johnny Suede haircut), is happy to toy with his image playing what is essentially 'The Dude' Lebowski's stupid cousin; the latter, doing something of relevance for the first time since he lampooned himself in Being John Malkovich (1999), transcends all the villains he's played in the past with a turn that reeks of borderline craziness and instant comic appeal.'So, what did we learn?', one character asks at one point. Applied to the audience, the answer would be: a) the Intelligence community is a league of morons; b) this might even be the Coens' funniest movie ever. A gem.",9,3,9,20 September 2008
Watchmen," Rorschach's journal: March 2009
","Watchmen is a film most people approach with an equal amount of excitement and fear. Excitement, because it's been wildly anticipated since 1987 and feels perfectly at home now, its themes of trust, paranoia and the true meaning of heroism being a suitable companion piece to Chris Nolan's The Dark Knight. Fear, because the original graphic novel is considered by many to be the best comic-book ever written in the English language, and given Hollywood's habit of screwing up anything created by Alan Moore (who preemptively had his name removed from the credits and swore he's never going to see the picture), there was a fairly big chance even director Zack Snyder's best intentions were overcome by studio reasoning. The truth? Watchmen is, to this day, the closest any movie has come to capturing the core of Moore's thoughts, one of the smartest comic-book movies of the decade and a visually rich blockbuster.For the uninitiated (in case there are any), Watchmen takes place in a very bleak 1985: Richard Nixon is now in his fourth term, there's a constant risk of nuclear war with Russia and superheroes have been outlawed. This means the titular group no longer exists, at least on paper. Then, one night in New York, a murder is committed. The police rule it off as standard business, but a masked vigilante named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) begs to differ: the victim was Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), aka The Comedian, the most violent of the Watchmen, and whoever offed him might be after the others. However, the others aren't that interested in Rorschach's theories: Dan 'Nite Owl' Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) and Laurie 'Silk Spectre' Jupiter (Nalin Akerman) are too busy catching up, Adrian 'Ozymandias' Veidt (Matthew Goode), self-proclaimed 'smartest man on the planet', prefers exploiting his own image and seeking alternative energy sources (okay, maybe he's got a point there), and as for the group's only real 'super' hero, Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup), aka Dr. Manhattan (a living atomic weapon after a lab accident), well, he's so all-powerful he no longer cares about the world. But what if Rorschach's right? What if someone wants to destroy the world and is making sure no one gets in the way? As Bob Dylan says during the beautiful opening montage, the times they are a-changin'...Watchmen was, ad is, a lot more than a comic-book: it's a mixture of poetry, politics, visuals, sex, violence, psychoanalysis and much, much more. Like all of Moore's work, what matters the most is the subtext and symbolism, starting with names like Rorschach (the famous test), Ozymandias (a poem by Shelley and, like the quote by Juvenal which gave the graphic novel its title, a warning against the abuse of power) or Dr. Manhattan (Project Manhattan is what led to the creation of the nuclear bomb). In a way, Watchmen was also a reflection on the superhero genre in itself, and Snyder retains some of that aspect as well, most notably the multiple generations subplot (the current Silk Spectre is the original's daughter) and the significance of the costumes (in Nite Owl's case, it's a substitute for Viagra). Of course, he couldn't include everything in a 160-minute feature, but the key story is left intact (save for the theory that two of the 'heroes' might be gay) and brought to the screen word for word.The same goes for the images: using the original panels by Dave Gibbons as storyboards (and convincing Gibbons to design the one scene that differs from the graphic novel), the director repeats the miracle of 300, bringing Moore's bleak world to life the exact way it was first conceived. Even better, he has managed to dodge the problem of not including the poetry and philosophy quotations by working extra hard on the soundtrack, picking a series of defining tunes that accompany the live-action treatment of Gibbons' illustrations. The result is visually and aurally striking (exhibit A: the Dr. Manhattan-centric segment), and the main reason Watchmen works so damn well on the big screen.And now, the 'but'. It's only one, but it's rather significant: although he's done a terrific job with the casting, why did Snyder insist that poor Matthew Goode, a bona fide Englishman, speak with a German accent? Sure, the character has a German-sounding name, but those speech patterns make him less charismatic as the picture progresses. Everyone else does a fine job, though, even Malin Akerman who is still best known to audiences as Ben Stiller's heinous wife in The Heartbreak Kid. Standing out - inevitably - is Haley's Rorschach, one of literature's (and cinema's) most credible psychos, a creepy yet strangely relatable vigilante who sums up the story's moral ambiguity to perfection.So, is Watchmen the best comic-book adaptation ever? Of course not. Okay, but is it the movie fans and casual moviegoers alike deserve? Oh, yes. It's ambitious, complex, dark and uncompromising. And yes, it's based on the Citizen Kane of comic-books, which makes it a must-see in any case.8,5/10",9,2,6,9 March 2009
The Bourne Identity," The name is Bourne, Jason Bourne...
","Sick of all those recent spy flicks (I don't need to name them, you know what I'm talking about) where plot and characters are buried by hundreds of visual effects and everything is the same movie after movie after movie? Then try The Bourne Identity, which brings new life to the genre. It's got everything you're after: intelligent story, believable and likable characters, and yes, action too, but it's realistic action, not some Matrix-style kicking.The most intriguing aspect is arguably that the hero is a vulnerable human being. In fact, at the beginning of the movie he is found half-dead in the French sea. Once he recovers, this stranger (Matt Damon) is stunned to realize he can speak five or six languages fluently, but doesn't remember where he learned them, or anything that happened prior to his awakening for that matter. The only clue he has is a bank account number in Switzerland, which reveals his name is Jason Bourne and he 's involved in some kind of classified activity. Unfortunately he doesn't have much time to sort things out, as his superiors (Chris Cooper and Brian Cox) think he has deserted and decide to take him down. With only a German student named Marie (Franka Potente) willing to help him, Bourne must put all the pieces together and find out exactly who he is before it is too late. Director Doug Liman and screenwriter Tony Gilroy have made their own version of The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum's novel is almost completely different), but who cares, as long as the movie works? It's one of the best spy stories ever made, and it looks like something that could actually happen (all of Bourne's weapons can be purchased by an average citizen). This is the anti-Bond, a man who actually gets hurt and would rather be left alone, and his vulnerability is grippingly conveyed through Damon's powerful performance. If there is a defect, it has to be the fact that the film's focus is almost entirely on the protagonist, overshadowing a fine supporting cast (especially Cooper and Clive Owen, whose turn as the Professor manages to be much more than a stereotyped 'silent killer' pantomime).Probably the most interesting action movie of 2002, with an even better sequel continuing in the same direction.",8,9,14,19 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Embrace the power of the Ring...
","I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad...That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called 'theatrical versions'): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others.As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the NÂ°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time.An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay).One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!",10,17,22,11 December 2005
28 Weeks Later," Frenetic, tragic and terrifying: a near-perfect horror sequel
","Horror sequels are almost by definition a cheap excuse to cash in on the originals. There are exceptions, like Wes Craven's meta-horror New Nightmare or George Romero's zombie saga, but they're a rarity. Thankfully, 28 Weeks Later, the follow-up few people expected to be made, retains its predecessor's sense of fear and desperation while adding its own dramatic elements, resulting in a film that fares a lot better next to other horror continuations of 2007 such as Hostel: Part II or Saw IV.Stepping back as a director (he was busy doing Sunshine) but remaining on board as an executive producer with original writer Alex Garland, Danny Boyle found it wise to hand over 28 Weeks Later to Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, whose feature debut Intacto was deemed good enough to trust him to do his own thing and not just another sequel. And that's exactly what he does: whereas 28 Days Later was merely about survival (with a hint of Romero-like satire of the military's excessive power), the new installment has a stronger central theme - family. In fact, the scarily intense prologue (the film's best scene, and one of the most effective opening sequences of all time), set within the time frame of the first movie, shows how the Infected, still as merciless as ever, rip apart entire families, leaving Don (Robert Carlyle), one of the few survivors, desperate over the loss of his wife Alice.28 weeks (seven moths) pass, and with the help of the US Army the Rgae virus has been completely wiped out. Britain is no longer quarantined, so Don can be reunited with his children. While they explore their new home, an American scientist (Rose Byrne) tries to determine whether there's any chance the virus might return, a possibility her military superior (Idris Elba) writes off as unlikely. Then all of a sudden Alice, seemingly immune to the disease, returns to everyone's surprise. An even worse surprise, though, is the fact that her not being infected doesn't mean she can't infect someone else. And so, before anyone can fully realize what's happened, London is once again under attack by the Infected, leaving it to Scarlet (Byrne) and a soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) to save Alice and Don's children, who may have inherited their mother's resistance to the Rage virus.The film is shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras, a stylistic choice that adds to the gritty realism Fresnadillo is seeking (this emerges most clearly in the aforementioned prologue). It's not really that different from what Boyle achieved in 28 Days Later, with the notable exception of the sequel being much more fast-paced, taking full advantage of the fact that the Infected, unlike your average zombie, are quite skilled runners. That, paired with a murky cinematography and most of the movie taking place in dark, closed spaces, instills a relentless sense of dread, meaning 28 Weeks Later manages to do what few others have done before: it's every bit as scary as the original.Cast-wise, Fresnadillo has made choices as smart as those of his predecessor: Carlyle, a familiar face in Boyle's body of work, may not be as good-looking as Cillian Murphy, but what he lacks in physical appearance he makes up for in dramatic talent, giving a heartfelt portrayal that is miles away for his more famous roles (Begbie in Trainspotting above all). Byrne (who, coincidentally, also appears in Sunshine), after a few less fortunate career choices (minor roles in average stuff like Troy or Attack of the Clones), does a c ompetent job, as does Renner, with additional gravitas coming from US TV veterans Elba (The Wire) and Harold Perrineau (Oz and Lost).Overall, in a genre that is usually doomed by crappy follow-ups, 28 Weeks Later stands out as one of the better exceptions to that rule. It's artful, it's moving, and most of all, it never lets go of the fear factor.",9,2,3,23 October 2008
The Village," Not a masterpiece, but well executed and better than they want you to believe
","After a seemingly invincible double hit consisting of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan hit a slightly false note with Signs, which is quite good but was strongly criticized nonetheless, mostly for its admittedly weak ending. The Village seems to continue in that direction, at least according to the majority of critics (Roger Ebert's review was particularly harsh). The reason I said 'seems' is because The Village is a competent, enjoyable movie - not a masterwork, and occasionally less accomplished than Signs, but still undisputed proof of Shyamalan's gift as a storyteller.What sets this film apart from those preceding it is the setting: the titular village is located somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the date is the 19th Century. The village, inhabited by the elders, their children and grandchildren, is surrounded by woods, and no one is allowed to enter them. Why? Because the woods are supposedly populated by Those We Do Not Speak Of, some kind of monstrous breed that won't attack the villagers unless directly provoked. They occasionally show up after dark, and they're repulsed by the color red.Among the people living in the village who deserve to be mentioned are Lucius Fox (Joaquin Phoenix), a brave young man who doesn't fear the creatures like everyone else, and Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind girl with whom he has a special bond. When Lucius suddenly falls ill (to reveal more would spoil the fun), Ivy volunteers to travel to the city to find medicine, unafraid of defying whatever's hiding in the woods. Amongst the general protest, her father (William Hurt) expresses his approval with a cryptic phrase that gains significance as the story progresses.A slow start notwithstanding, Shyamalan manages to create a sense of quiet dread very quickly, thanks to expert use of camera angles, cinematography, and of course James Newton Howard's tunes. Subtly evoking The Wicker Man with its atmosphere, The Village drags the viewer into a different world, an uncontaminated society devoid of any real evil. In that sense, the film is a clever twist on the utopia genre: generally, these worlds exist in the future, not the past.However, that's not the kind of twist we expect from the director, and that's where the film's major disappointment reveals itself: the usual shocking final revelation is practically spoon-fed to the audience halfway through, not to mention delivered as flatly as is humanly possible. This does detract from the twist's impact, but it doesn't diminish its intelligence: taken on its own, it's worth comparing to the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.Then there's the cast, another partial misfire: although Hurt is warm and reassuring, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver have practically nothing significant to do in the film, and Adrien Brody's demented role is nothing but a contrived plot device. On the flip-side, Phoenix is very good (the scene where Lucius tells Ivy how he feels about her is the most touching tender moment Shyamalan's filmed), and Howard, cast without an audition after the director saw her in a stage play (he didn't know she was related to former Happy Days star Ron Howard), is mesmerizing: playing her first major part without much experience (a few cameos in her dad's movies don't really count), she portrays Ivy as good-hearted and a little naive but never stupid, which is why she manages to hold the entire second half of the picture on her shoulders pretty much flawlessly.Bottom line: quit nagging about the ending. As I said in my review of The Sixth Sense, a good conclusion is no big thing if the overall movie disappoints. Well, the opposite applies too: a sub-par epilogue doesn't completely ruin an otherwise fine film.7,5/10",8,4,6,18 June 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Welcome to America's funniest family!
","Little Miss Sunshine is a rarity among US comedies (Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson not included). Because of all the hype surrounding it (enthusiastic reviews at the Sundance festival), you expect something really good. For once (and that's the rare thing), the actual film might even exceed expectations. This is one of the funniest, most original movies I've seen in a long time.The film gets it title from a beauty contest for five or six-year old girls. One of the participants is Olive Hoover (Abigail Preslin), the archetypal sweet little kid who just wants to fulfill her dreams. Unfortunately, she has to go to California (where the competition takes place) with her highly dysfunctional family: her father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), has invented a nine-step program to succeed in life, only no one listens to him (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia minus the charisma); brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) has recently discovered Nietzsche and made a silence vow, which will be broken once he gets to join the Air Force; uncle Frank (Steve Carell) is Proust-obsessed, gay and suicidal (and he's the most normal family member); Grandpa (the scene-stealing Alan Arkin) is infatuated with the F-word ('Again with the f**cking chicken!') and has been thrown out of a retirement home for snorting heroin; and finally, mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who has to take care of all these people. Thought the Simpsons were a weird family? Not anymore...The film's charm lies in its straightforwardness: first-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris bring Michael Arndt's superb screenplay to life without any hidden messages or subtexts. They don't judge their protagonists, but use them to make us understand what doesn't work in America (okay, so there is a small subtext after all). During the last half hour, Little Miss Sunshine is a poignant critique against US show business, particularly its need to exploit children for ratings' sake. The Hoovers are a perfect tool to cruelly hit that target, thanks to an amazing ensemble: Kinnear and Collette are on top form (the last time the former was so funny was in 1997's As Good as It Gets), while Arkin and Carell (playing a more 'mature' character after the likes of Bruce Almighty and The 40-Year Old Virgin) provide most of the movie's best moments (the scene where Frank exposes his quirky situation to the rest of the family is priceless).Those looking for good laughs just have to see Little Miss Sunshine. I can't recall ever laughing so much while watching a recent comedy, and that's really saying something.",9,4,9,17 August 2006
Knowing," And in the end...
","What has happened to Alex Proyas? Back in the '90s, he directed dark, edgy pieces of sci-fi/horror, like The Crow and Dark City, that didn't necessarily pander to studio or audience expectations. Nowadays, he's gone in exactly the opposite direction, first with the fun but uneven Will Smith vehicle I, Robot (which doesn't have much in common with Asimov, despite the title) and now with the Nicolas Cage-starring Knowing. Entirely bad it ain't, but boy, does it struggle from time to time.Cage plays a physics professor at MIT, named John Koestler, who teaches students about the notion of determinism, i.e. the theory that everything is part of a precise, already established plan. The irony is that he doesn't believe any of that stuff since his wife died in a tragic accident, leaving him alone with his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). One day, something special occurs at Caleb's school: a time capsule, which was buried fifty years earlier, is unearthed so that the new generation can see what kids thought the future would look like back then. Instead of a drawing, Caleb ends up with a page containing a bizarre sequence of numbers. John takes a look at the sequence, and quickly (?) realizes that the numbers represent the dates and body count of every major disaster of the last five decades, including 9/11, Katrina and - big surprise - the death of the missus. Three of the predictions, however, have yet to come true, so John must find a way to prevent them from happening. Additionally, he has to deal with a group of weird-looking people who are interested in Caleb.If it all sounds a bit familiar, that's because it is: while the story develops on its own terms, the premise alone, coupled with the creepy atmosphere, could come from an episode of The X-Files. In case the similarities weren't clear enough, the writers have even replicated the Mulder-Scully dynamic in the shape of John and his reluctant partner Diana (Rose Byrne) and added the inevitable religious subtext, which is hinted at from the very beginning (John's dad is a preacher). Also, the Strangers look kind of... In short, it's the sense of déjà vu that brings down most of Knowing: the third act is very easy to guess, the father/son relationship is sketchy, yada yada yada.And yet Proyas manages to get some things admirably right: the tension is actually pretty consistent, with a few professionally delivered jump-scares along the way, and the visual effects are state-of-the-art, most notably in the impressive central set-piece which - a true stroke of genius, this one - is depicted in a single, continuous shot. Additionally, Cage's performance is one of his most convincing in quite some time. Okay, so it's not that difficult given his recent body of work includes the likes of The Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Next, but his portrayal of a man who questions his beliefs (there we go again) adds some emotional weight to the picture. And that's without mentioning the refreshingly merciless conclusion...Knowing is nothing new, meaning that the few unexpected elements it contains are rapidly sidelined by textbook scripting. Still, even on an off-day Proyas manages to pull off a collection of oddly compelling images (Cage's hair not included). Not quite enough, but we already sort of knew that, right?",6,47,82,11 July 2009
The Shining," 5% King, 100% Kubrick: a bona fide horror classic
","The Shining is a weird example of adaptation: it has very little in common with the source novel, written by Stephen King, yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master's work. This is due to two factors: Stanley Kubrick's masterful direction and Jack Nicholson's chilly acting.Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who accepts to take care of the Overlook Hotel in Canada during the winter period, unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place: he claims a nice, isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book. Therefore the Overlook becomes the new home of the Torrance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and their five-year old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something's wrong: he has been told by the cook, Dick O' Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy, the titular Shining, which allows people like him and Dick to see flashes from the past and the future, among other things. Because of this 'gift', the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in Danny, even though he is quite capable of resisting them. That is not Jack's case, however, as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts, triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break.The Shining works as a horror movie because Kubrick, though having never worked on this kind of film before, knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't, hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths. King criticized the director for changing most of the story, omitting most of the Jack/Danny subplot (merely hinted at in the film) that led to the book's emotionally strong climax, and while his disappointment is valid, the omission was actually necessary: the novel dealt with redemption, albeit in an unconventional way, and redemption is a theme Kubrick, one of the most famous analysts of human decay, never had a soft spot for. What he is interested in is the mental, and subsequently physical, unbalance that threatens the characters, and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot (Danny's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example).Another criticism King raised was about the actors, especially Nicholson: in the writer's opinion, his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate Jack already was insane, thus undermining the rest of the story. Now, it is true that Nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning, but it is equally true that Martin Sheen (King's ideal choice for the role) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as Nicholson's: from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal 'Here's Johnny!' scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star. As for Duvall and Lloyd, both add terrific support, the latter especially deserving a place alongside Harvey Stephens (The Omen's Damien) and Haley Joel Osment as cinema's great horror child icons. One might complain about Duvall being completely different from the book counterpart (blonde and beautiful) and not having much else to do but scream and run, but two things ought to be considered: a) back in 1980 the 'scream queen' cliché wasn't one yet; b) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera, making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from Wendy's eyes.Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work (and he should know, given the liberties Danny Boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen), yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad. The Shining proves said point to perfection: very little from the novel, approximately 5%, is included in the film, but in Kubrick and Nichlolson's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest, most original horror pictures of all time, which really is saying something given the genre's current poor form.",10,10,16,25 July 2007
Salt," The name is Salt, Evelyn Salt...
","Despite the massive hype surrounding the film, including a trailer that gave away nothing in regards to the secretive plot, there was one major factor speaking against Phillip Noyce's latest action movie, Salt: the fact that one Tom Cruise, though never officially attached, had turned down the lead role - subsequently redesigned for Angelina Jolie - in favor of the disappointing Knight and Day, which he considered a better, more 'fun' option. However, Noyce's track record has always been an almost foolproof guarantee of entertainment, and while it isn't his best film, Salt is a good way to spend two hours at the movies.About that mysterious plot, then: Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a skilled CIA agent who tries to juggle her career and her personal life the best she can, without having her husband (August Diehl) suspect anything. All's well until a Russian spy is apprehended and a conspiracy involving sleeper agents on US soil, an assassination attempt and the so-called 'Day X' is revealed. In fact, Evelyn is identified by this spy as one of the Russian undercover agents, leading to her arrest at the hands of her colleagues and friends (Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor). One impressive escape later, and Salt is on the run, desperate to prove her innocence, no matter the cost.It's easy to see why Cruise bailed out: there are certain similarities between Salt and his Mission: Impossible franchise, not least a scene that requires the main character to wear a latex mask (although the Slat version is far less convincing and makes for one of the picture's more laughable moments). What sets Salt apart, though, is a more reality-based premise: Day X is - apparently - something that gets mentioned in Intelligence circles, and a similar sleeper mission was discovered just a few months before the film's premiere. How odd, then, that Kurt Wimmer's screenplay (reportedly worked on by Brian Helgeland as well) is less precise than the circumstances would promise, with certain contrivances being too outlandish for the genre and the entire final act resting on a couple of plot holes. Clearly, attention has been put on action rather than narrative coherence.But oh, what action: never once stopping to breathe, the movie jumps from one set-piece to the next, keeping the adrenaline levels high and suspension of disbelief within reasonable boundaries (check out the Matrix-inspired highway chase). Noyce clearly cherishes this chance to make a kick-ass genre flick, and he has found his perfect ally in Jolie, much changed since their previous collaboration (The Bone Collector, a decade back): having evolved from an acting force to be reckoned with to go-to action lady (see Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith or Wanted), she delivers the good from beginning to end, cheerfully overshadowing equally talented people like Screiber and Ejiofor. If a sequel were to materialize (not entirely impossible), it would be worth it just to see her on the run once again.A great spy flick, then? No, not quite. But it's a lot of genuine fun while it lasts, as long as no one starts questioning the logic. I mean, who needs that when you've got Jolie doing her usual stuff?",7,1,4,23 September 2010
Edward Scissorhands," The beginning of a wonderful partnership
","Throughout the decades, there have been various successful regular collaborations between a director and an actor: Martin Scorsese/Robert De Niro, Akira Kurosawa/Toshiro Mifune, Federico Fellini/Marcello Mastroianni, Billy Wilder/Jack Lemmon, John Ford/John Wayne...Hell, the list could be endless. But the most interesting one in my opinion is the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp partnership, which has produced five weird, unusual, fascinating movies so far. It all began in 1990 with this beautiful opus...Burton mixes Frankenstein and Beauty and the Beast in this peculiar Gothic love story between artificial guy Edward (Depp) and his host's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder). This far, nothing wrong. Well, unless you consider the fact that Eddie's got giant scissors for hands, since his creator (Vincent Price, in his last role) passed away before finishing him. Therefore he has to live with his 'digits', which actually come in handy as he starts charming the local ladies with his hairdressing/grass-cutting abilities. Unfortunately, trouble is on its way, as the boy can't tell the difference between good and evil, right and wrong...It's pretty clear whose side Burton's on: the 'freak' is much more 'human' than other people and Johnny Depp makes that possible thanks to one of his best performances ever (on my list, Edward ranks #3, straight after Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow). Winona Ryder is excellent as well, her Kim being the only one who totally understands our troubled protagonist.Batman may have made the director a celebrity, but it's this movie that showed the world exactly how talented and non-conventional he could be.",10,0,1,6 December 2005
Van Helsing," Occasionally good horror homage
","The idea of making a homage to the classic Universal horror films of the '30s wasn't bad.Unfortunately,the result is hardly a masterpiece.The movie is about Gabriel Van Helsing,a monster slayer who works for the Vatican(John Carpenter's Vampires,anyone?)and is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula(Richard Roxburg)with the help of his assistant Carl(David Wenham)and local beauty Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale).The script is interesting,but looks most like an excuse to put Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and the Wolfman(Will Kemp)in the movie,and this is proved by their limited screen time.But what are we supposed to expect,since Van Helsing is Dracula's nemesis? As for the acting,Kate Beckinsale has done much better films;Jakcman isn't that bad,but his character lacks something of what made Wolverine so loved by everyone;Roxburg's Dracula is amusing,although it seems he's parodying Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee.The only actors really worth watching between the endless CG battles are Hensley,Wenham and Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor.Partially enjoyable,it's good if you want to spend two hours watching a 100% blockbuster whose only goal is to entertain you without providing any emotion.",6,2,4,29 September 2005
The White Ribbon," Once upon a time in pre-Nazi Germany...
","The White Ribbon is an intriguingly strange piece of film: a deliberately elusive thriller, 150 minutes long, in black and white, set in Germany just before World War I. It's also the long awaited return to his mother tongue for Austrian provocateur Michael Haneke, after a decade filming in French and, in the case of his shot-for-shot remake of his own Funny Games, English. Additionally, and most importantly, it might be his most important film to date.The story takes place in an unnamed rural village, where a strong Lutheran mindset rules. Over a period of a year, strange events occur which cause harm to some of the more respected inhabitants, like the doctor, the priest and, in a potentially political act, the local nobility. But who is to blame? Somehow, the children seem to be playing a significant role in this, and the priest comes up with a severe punishment: his offspring will have to wear a white ribbon, symbolizing their lost innocence, until they are trustworthy again...Like all of Haneke's previous movies, The White Ribbon is, at first sight, a very frustrating picture: static shots, and overall 'coldness' (despite a surprisingly spot-on comedic segment) and, most 'annoyingly', a whodunit story with no solution. But that, of course, was to be expected: Haneke, an academic as well as a filmmaker, is not interested in easy answers, a fact that is most evident in his decision to deal with his trademark theme - the effects of violence on society - without depicting most of the acts on-screen (there are no sudden gushes of blood like in Funny Games or Hidden). Despite its straightforward storytelling, this Palme d'Or-winner could seem to be the director's most uncommercial feature, devoid as it is of a real 'solution' and 'big' names in the cast (although Haneke aficionados might recognize Susanne Lothar, the female star of the first Funny Games).And yet it is a masterwork, because in his apparent refusal to spoon-feed the audience Haneke still provides a riveting - and frightening - study of human behavior, specifically man's capacity for evil. Beneath the sublime use of black and white and the period reconstruction, which give the picture a neatly anonymous, timeless feel (despite a couple of time-specific remarks), lies a very precise point of view on a very definite moment in history: the narrator (who, in pure mystery tale tradition, isn't very reliable) says the bizarre events in the village might shed some light on subsequent happenings, and Haneke seems to suggest the punished children of 1913 will have a chance to retaliate against other 'wrongdoers' some twenty years later. It's merely an implication, with no closing captions to openly state the director's point, but it remains very unsettling.Proving that you don't need blood and other gimmicks to make a statement about violence, The White Ribbon is a superb essay on the human condition: elusive, yet poignant and right on the mark. Extraordinary.",10,1,7,4 July 2010
Monsters vs. Aliens," It's all in the title!
","Freddy vs. Jason, Alien vs. Predator and now... Monsters vs Aliens? No, it's not another brainless, cash-motivated horror icon mash-up, but a heartfelt tribute to those '40s and '0s movies where cult genre figures (Dracula, the Wolf Man and, uh, Abbott & Costello) ran into each other for no apparent reason. It's also Dreamworks' most accomplished feature since Shrek 2 (although Kung Fu Panda came pretty close).The incredibly simple story goes like this: on her wedding day, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is infected by meteorite radiations and becomes a 50-foot menace. To avoid mass panic, a certain General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) locks her up in a top secret facility with other monsters such as Insectosaurus (the name says it all), the blob-like B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), The Missing Link (Will Arnett) and Dr. Cockroach, Phd (Hugh Laurie). However, freedom is offered when an evil alien named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) starts wreaking havoc and the planet traditional defences prove to be less efficient than expected.Those expecting anything new will be sorely disappointed: Monsters vs Aliens is a 100-minute cliché marathon, from the Dr. Strangelove-inspired secret meetings to the typically moronic US President (Stephen Colbert), with the usual string of references (Star Trek and Close Encounters) and spoofs (Beverly Hills Cop and Mars Attacks!) coming along the way. But for once, the plot's weaknesses are actually a strength: since this is a homage to films that had pretty lame scripts, why should this one have a smarter story?Then again, most people won't care about the plot: the real attraction is the 3-D. Impressive and breathtaking, yes, but as Jeffrey Katzenberg pointed out, the writers and directors were keen to shell out a feature that could be enjoyed just as much even without the funny glasses. This is accomplished through clever gags and even smarter voice casting, Sutherland and Laurie above all ('I'm not a quack, I'm a mad scientist. There's a difference.').In short: this is fun and exciting all the way, whether you watch it in 3-D or not. Besides, what's not to love about a movie that contains the line 'Another UFO has landed in the United States, the only place where UFOs seem to land.'?",8,0,1,9 May 2009
Dreamgirls," A bit overrated, but hugely entertaining and stylish
","Based on the famous Broadway musical, Dreamgirls was meant to be an Oscar-stealing picture, like 2002's Chicago. Instead, it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture of 2006, making it the film to receive the most nominations (8) except for the 'big' one. Now, does this mean Dreamgirls isn't worth watching? Certainly not. While it's true that other films are much better (The Departed, Babel, United 93 and several others), this ambitious flick is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser, and won't disappoint fans of the genre. In fact, the story it tells is so captivating it might even seduce viewers who aren't particularly fond of musicals.Set in the '60s, Dreamgirls is a classic 'a star is born' tale, as it shows us the troubled rise to fame of a female singing trio, the Dreamettes. When we first see them, they participate in a contest looking for young talents. Obviously, they lose, but soon enough a 'guardian angel' shows up. His name is Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), and having realized those girls are pretty good, he decides to give them a chance by changing their name (from now on, they're the Dreams) and having them sing alongside the experienced, incredibly popular James 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy). Happiness isn't meant to last, though: problems begin when Curtis announces lead singer Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) will be sidelined in favor of the less talented, but better-looking Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles). It's the old rules of celebrity: you don't have to be good at what you do, you have to look fabulous on camera.In his exploration of the darker side of show business, director Bill Condon (who also wrote the aforementioned Chicago) benefits from the fact that he knows how to use the camera to make every single stage-originated scene look breathlessly cinematic: from brilliant editing to sublime cinematography, every element makes sure Dreamgirls is an unforgettable experience, visually speaking. If the film has flaws, and it does, it's related to Condon's decision to leave Hudson and Murphy out of most of the film's second half. The former, making her motion picture debut, is nothing short of mesmerizing, stealing all scenes from her co-stars; Murphy, on the other hand, is at the peak of his career here, delivering a performance that's both wildly entertaining and stunningly vulnerable. It's a shame two performers that brilliant (and Oscar-worthy) are denied more screen time as the movie progresses (especially considering Foxx's semi-villainous turn lacks that extra something that would enable him to carry most of the picture). It is also vaguely annoying that, being this an all-black musical, Condon feels compelled to insert one or two hugely clichéd 'white people stole our music' moments. So, is Dreamgirls a masterpiece? Not really. Okay, but is it good enough to justify (most of) the hype surrounding it? Yes, it certainly is.7,5/10",8,2,4,16 February 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A bit too long, perhaps, but otherwise charming and funny
","Following a couple of supporting roles in Bruce Almighty and Anchorman (not to mention a regular presence on Saturday Night Live), Steve Carell rose to fame playing the lead in The 40 Year Old Virgin. The title might make some believe the movie's gonna be two hours of puerile jokes, but that's far from true: it's actually a really smart and interesting comedy, as well as a showcase of Carell's star power.His character, Andy Stitzer, leads a pretty dull life: he collects action figures, goes everywhere by bike and has no social life (except for a neighbor with whom he watches Survivor). Then one night he's asked to join his colleagues from the hi-fi store for a poker game. Once the guys start talking about their sex lives, it turns out Andy's a virgin (who else would say a woman's breasts 'feel like a bag full of sand' ?). Since that's a quite embarrassing condition for a 40-year old, his 'pals' see it as their duty to make sure Andy finally sleeps with someone. Hence a series of increasingly awkward situations involving drunk teenagers, speed dating and male prostitutes (you know, just in case our man doesn't like the ladies). In the meantime, Andy has managed to find the woman of his dreams: Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who sells things on e-bay. There's an obvious spark between them, with only one blatant problem: how long before Andy will have to tell her the inconvenient truth?The charm of this film lies in the direction the story takes once the premise is set: what started as a mere search for sex turns into a quest for true love, as the protagonist struggles to get to the end of the story without jeopardizing his relationship with Trish (the chemistry between the two characters is truly moving). Instead of another gross-out comedy, director Judd Apatow (who also co-wrote the script with his leading man) has delivered something a little more profound, with the occasional bits of mandatory slapstick (Andy getting his chest waxed... ouch!). The only real criticism I can raise about The 40 Year Old Virgin concerns its excessive running time: being almost two hours long, it seems like some set-pieces were added just to keep the movie going before it reaches its predictable yet enjoyable conclusion. It is, however, worth watching, both for its absurd but believable concept and the hilarious Carell, who proves to be a genuinely funny guy, with hints of an ability to tackle more mature roles as well (as he did superbly in the splendid Little Miss Sunshine). This film deserves all the praise it has received for putting such a talented comedian on the map.7,5/10",8,1,2,21 December 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Now more than ever, we need the Jedi...
","The first, basic appeal of Grant Heslov's war comedy The Men Who Stare at Goats lies in the title: silly, amusing and just about unique enough to grab attention. Add a director with a solid reputation - he's George Clooney's producing partner and co-wrote the excellent Good Night, and Good Luck - and a stellar cast (Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, plus terrific support from established character actors like Stephen Root, Robert Patrick and Glenn Morshower), and you've got all the right ingredients for a smart piece of entertainment.Based on Welsh journalist Jon Ronson's non-fiction book (a story 'more true than you would believe', according to the movie's opening caption), the film focuses primarily on the misadventures of Ronson's on-screen alter ego, the American Bob Wilton (McGregor, doing his finest accent work since Big Fish), a reporter who has gone off to a war-ridden Iraq to prove to his ex-wife that he is, in fact, a real man. Prior to his travel, he recounts his meeting with a former soldier (Root) who claimed to have been part of an unusual army unit. The story is confirmed when Wilton meets the disgraced Lyn Cassady (Clooney), who was once the most promising element of said unit: the New Earth army, a covert division born from the idea of a Vietnam veteran, Bill Django (Bridges), who believed it would be easier to win wars by resorting to the power of the mind, hence the recruitment of soldiers who were supposedly able to accomplish such feats as walking through solid walls and stopping a heart simply by staring at the subject (the hilarious titular scene). The unit was disbanded following the scheme of one Larry Hooper (Spacey), but now it appears to have resurfaced, and Cassady is headed to a new mission. Anything can happen...The Men Who Stare at Goats works because it walks that fine line between amusingly serious and seriously zany without ever disrupting the balance between the two. Backed up by the fact that this is a (mostly) true story, it is therefore a film that manages to provoke huge laughs while at the same time cause reflections on the weird nature of America's participation in conflicts (the use of the Barney the Dinosaur theme song as a torture device was reportedly inspired by events depicted in the movie). The satire, while never specifically aimed at one element of the US government (although Ronald Reagan is mentioned at one point, to good effect), follows the example of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove in that it never paves the way for outright silliness, barring the final 20 minutes which appear to have been conceived as a mere means to end the film (this is most obvious in the final shot which, funny as it may be, leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste).The movie also works admirably as a straightforward comedy, thanks to instantly quotable lines (see Django's trial), clever cinematic winks (the New Earth Army men are called 'Jedi warriors') and spot-on performances: McGregor, saddled with the seemingly ungrateful task of playing the 'regular' guy, is a perfect vessel for the audience, enabling us to marvel at the sight of Clooney's terrific combination of smart and dumb, Bridges (sort of) resurrecting 'The Dude' Lebowski via his hippie approach to warfare and Spacey adding a brilliant comedic shade to his traditional villainous persona. Not one false note when these people are around.To sum it up, The Men Who Stare at Goats is a very thoughtful, insightful comedy, which boasts great ideas without forgetting to bring laughs along for the ride. Oh, and former Star Wars hero McGregor asking 'What's a Jedi?' just has to be the year's best in-joke.",8,6,13,9 November 2009
Spider-Man," A really great comic book adaptation
","'With great power comes great responsibility'.These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.Recommended even if you don't care about the comics.",8,96,121,8 October 2005
Collateral," A night to remember...
","When this film was shown at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, some critics complained about the fact that it was out of competition, since it was the best picture of those screened that year. They were right. Collateral is a beautiful, stylish, moving film. If it weren't for Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Million Dollar Baby, it would be the best movie of 2004. It's a remarkable achievement, made with expertise and inspiration.The film is set during a night in Los Angeles (the time frame being 9.30 PM - 5.40 AM). We meet a cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx), a man who's been doing that job for twelve years, hoping that sooner or later he'll be able to have enough cash for a project he's pursuing. He's a nice person, willing to take short cuts so that his passengers won't have to pay too much (how many taxi drivers would actually do such a thing?). But after that night, he'll never be the same person. Just after an attractive attorney (Jada Pinkett Smith) has left his vehicle, a new customer shows up. He tells Max he has to make five stops before 6.00 AM, and offers him 600 dollars for the ride. The unsuspecting driver accepts, only to regret his decision minutes later: Vincent (Tom Cruise) is not an ordinary passenger. He's a professional assassin, hired to kill five people and then leave L.A. before anybody notices. And now Max has to help him, whether he likes it or not.The film is directed by Michael Mann, whose other masterwork, Heat, also took place in Los Angeles. In fact, Mann has become to L.A. what Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and Woody Allen are to New York: he knows every single corner of the city, and by shooting the film on with DV cameras he makes sure the audience gets to see what a beautiful place it is at night. But Mann's genius lies in the fact that he doesn't let the aerial shots of the buildings distract us, but makes them a vital part of his protagonists'journey, which is the core of the movie.The bond that is created between killer and hostage is arguably the best ever dealt with by Mann. If you liked De Niro and Pacino interacting in Heat, you'll be in awe when you witness the confrontation between Max and Vincent. Rarely have we seen two people so radically different: Max has lots of ambition, but won't do anything to even try improving his life. Vincent, on the other hand, is completely uninterested in human life. The only thing he cares about is doing his job perfectly, regardless of why he has to do it ('Should I only kill people I know?' he asks at a certain point) or what consequences there will be, since in his opinion we're all ultimately insignificant if compared with the rest of the universe. These are two loners who desperately need each other: Vincent depends on Max to get the work done in time, and our cab driver needs his adversary to realize it's time to take action and do something that makes a difference. It's a fascinating relationship, given additional depth by two excellent performances: Cruise is perfectly at his ease playing against type, while Foxx steps out of anonymity with a powerful, compelling, Oscar-worthy effort (he eventually lost out to the equally good Morgan Freeman, who won for the aforementioned Million Dollar Baby).Those who believe in cinema's ability to move as well as entertain should give Collateral a try. It truly stands out as one of the best genre films ever made (shame it wasn't considered for Best Picture of 2004, though).",10,3,5,28 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker and better: the Potter franchise keeps maturing
","Like Tim Burton did with Batman, Chris Columbus 'dumped' the Harry Potter franchise after the first two movies. Luckily, his replacement, Alfonso Cuaròn, is no Joel Schumacher and the third Potter episode is no Batman Forever.While still children-friendly enough to get a PG, The Prisoner of Azkaban is quite darker than Columbus' opening twosome: this time, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in serious danger. No, the fact that he put a spell on his aunt has nothing to do with it. The real problem Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a feared murderer who has broken out of magical prison Azkaban to track down and kill our favorite teenage wizard. Why? Well, probably because he used to work for Voldemort and wants to complete what he started several years ago: apparently, he is the one who betrayed Harry's parents, leading to their death. With all the other weird things going on at Hogwarts (new teachers, werewolves, 'I have a bad feeling about this' speeches), it looks like the third year will be like the previous two: filled with dangers, excitement and, most of all, magic.Cuaròn does an excellent job when it comes to showing the young protagonists' growing pains and frustrations, emphasizing the fact that they are getting older and more aware of what is required of them, as well as laying the grounds for further exploration of teenage problems in the upcoming fourth film. Also, unlike Columbus, he's not afraid of removing certain parts of the book to make the film less stiff. As a result, Prisoner of Azkaban is more fluid and enjoyable than the first two Potter flicks, but the director could and should have kept a couple of crucial explanations in the third act, their absence implying viewers who haven't read the book might be left with more questions than answers. Another crucial innovation, as previously mentioned, is the darker tone, never more evident than in the scenes featuring the Dementors, the demonic creatures that have been sent to capture Black. An impressive example of good (as in serving the story, not being above it) CGI, they might remind of the Nazguls from The Lord of the Rings at first, but in the end they come off as much more frightening).As for the additions the cast (the other element to constantly evaluate in each new film), Emma Thompson is very amusing (though in a spooky way), while Michael Gambon proves a worthy replacement for the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, having the authority and at the same time kindness the role demands. But ultimately, this movie belongs to two actors: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. The former provides warmth and humanity as Remus Lupin, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, even if it is weird no one ever becomes suspicious because of his last name (as seen in the brilliant climax); the latter comes close to stealing the entire movie, making Sirius Black this installment's Big Thing. All the character's pain, resentment and anger come out of Oldman's face and mouth with an almost scary intensity, adding plenty to the film's emotional resonance.Overall, this darker, less by-the-book (in terms of fidelity to the source material) Potter is much better than the first two entries in the series. If the fourth movie is at least equally good, the franchise might turn into something spectacular.",9,1,3,22 November 2005
Ratatouille," Pixar at the peak of their creativity!
","After the partial disappointment of Cars, which was good but not enough by Pixar standards, it is a joy to see the company return to form. In fact, Ratatouille could even be the best picture they have produced so far, beating The Incredibles, Nemo and even Toy Story.The film wasn't actually as heavily marketed as previous Pixar achievements, possibly because audiences, both young and adult, wouldn't really know what to think of this peculiar movie, which stars a rat. Yes, that's correct, a rat. The rodent's name is Remy (Patton Oswalt), and he is endowed with a particularly powerful nose, which allows him to tell what kinds of food are good or bad based on the smell. This has made him extremely picky when it comes to his diet, and during one of his culinary expeditions he is accidentally separated from his family. After traveling in the sewers for a while, he finds himself in the middle of Paris, the capital of excellent cooking. His joy is only temporary, though, as he discovers that his favorite restaurant (he has seen it on TV) has lost three of its five stars, the first because a nasty food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O' Toole) gave the place a more negative review than usual, the second because the leading chef, Gusteau (Brad Garrett), died of grief. Now the restaurant is in worse shape than ever, as new boss Skinner (Ian Holm) is simply interested in business and doesn't care about the food's quality. Fortunately, Remy, despite being a rat, has taken Gusteau's motto ('Anyone can cook') to heart and, guided by the great chef's ghost, he tries to bring things back to normal, finding an ally in the clumsy but good-hearted Linguini (Lou Romano), through whom he manages to prepare one delicious dish after another, restoring the restaurant's reputation.The premise might sound far-fetched even for a Disney/Pixar movie, and yet Ratatouille has the best script made for an animated feature in ages: staying faithful to the company's belief that story and character come first, not celebrity voices and pop-culture references (as is the case with Dreamworks' cartoons), writer-director Brad Bird, the man behind The Incredibles), has crafted a screenplay of rare (for a 'toon, that is) sharpness and intelligence, consisting of an intriguing plot, smart gags (including one midway through the movie that should be inappropriate in a G-rated picture but somehow fits neatly into the pitch-perfect narrative) and, most of all, fully developed characters. Whereas most animated films focus on a limited group of people, Pixar has always been famous for giving everyone a moment in the spotlight, and it shows the most in this film: the bond between Remy and Linguini, which is every bit as solid and compelling as the ones between Woody and Buzz or Mike and Sully, is of course at the center of the picture's events, but the initially awkward, then tender relationship between the inept aspiring cook and his coworker Colette (Janeane Garofalo) is equally well built and moving; supporting characters such as Remy's brother and father, who are incapable of understanding his love for proper food, the mischievous Skinner or psychotic cook Horst (voiced by Will Arnett, best known for the hilarious, prematurely canceled Arrested Development), who always has a different explanation for why he used to be in prison (it ranges from 'I created a hole in the Ozone layer over Avignon' to 'I killed a man... with this thumb!'), provide most of the situation's foolproof humor; as for Ego, to whom O' Toole lends one of the best voices ever to have been used in animation, he stands out as one of the best villains in animated film history (that the makers of such critically adored movies decided to use a critic as the bad guy is another stroke of genius).Also fundamental is the originality: apart from the obviously unusual pitch (rat turns out to be best chef in France), Ratatouille is a gold-mine of superb material from the splendid start to the exceptional ending, which revives Pixar's trademark surprise element that was missing in Cars. The real surprise, however, is the amount of stuff Bird comes up with in between: most movies, especially action flicks and comedies, run out of ideas at a certain point but keep going because otherwise the running time would be too short (this is evident in the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels which, albeit funny and exciting, were famously, and obviously, written as the shooting went on); in Ratatouille, whenever a joke has run its course it is immediately followed by one exactly as brilliant, thus making the film a seemingly never-ending flow of wit at its sharpest.Bottom line: after a a partial misfire, Pixar is, thankfully, back on track with the only film that is capable of rivaling The Simpsons Movie as the best animated feature of the year, and that is really saying something.",10,3,4,21 August 2007
Aliens," Hands down one of the best sequels ever!
","Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn't aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her 'unjustified' absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she's told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen's android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.Ah, the film's mood: that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original's tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest.",10,38,52,15 May 2007
The Fast and the Furious," Shallow as hell, but fun to watch
","If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious.Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up.As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings.In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better.7,5/10",8,1,2,19 November 2006
Gandhi," Conventional but solid biopic, with an immortal central performance
","Lawrence of Arabia, Amadeus, Bird... those biopics just can't be under two hours, can they? Not that there's anything wrong with that: those three films are all masterpieces, justly revered by film-lovers of all ages and origin. Gandhi does not really qualify as a masterwork (it does have a few defects), but it's consistently interesting and well acted, to the point you won't even notice it's over three hours long.As is expected, the movie starts at the end: while greeting a crowd of followers, Mahatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) is assassinated by a fanatic. As the funeral starts, director Richard Attenborough takes us back in time, so we can witness the man's career: from the time Gandhi, a newly appointed lawyer, was thrown off a train, to his decision to boycott English rules in a non-violent way, his entire life is shown to the audience, with particular focus on his struggles with British authorities (Trevor Howard, John Mills, John Gielgud) and his relationship with an American journalist (Martin Sheen).The long running time is justified by Attenborough's need to tell a complete story, one he planned to make for decades before someone actually agreed to produce the project. The time he spent waiting was well used, though: he got to meet and cast Kingsley, who delivers a powerhouse turn - quiet, calm and wise, he is so reminiscent of the real Gandhi it's no wonder the film's Indian extras believed the actor to be the Mahatma's reincarnation. But the film isn't a mere one-man show: the supporting cast is superlative (Gielgud especially), and the wonderful cinematography and locations do nothing but confirm the director's passion for the subject.However, it is absolutely clear Attenborough's utmost respect for Gandhi prevents him from doing something really extraordinary with the film. Don't get me wrong, it never becomes boring, it's just that at times the direction is too by-the-book to make the picture any different from a standard biopic. There is also the slight problem of Kingsley having some initial trouble to fully convince as the aged Mahatma, but that's a minor issue that is quickly forgotten.Still, the movie deserves its high reputation and most of the Oscars it won. Calling it the best film of 1982 is a bit of a stretch, though, a fact even Attenborough has acknowledged (he reportedly took the role of Hammond in Jurassic Park because he felt bad about stealing the top prize from E.T.). Kind of overrated, then, but quite worth your time.",8,0,2,23 April 2008
Saw III," Game over? You wish...
","Saw II, while good, lacked the odd charm of the first installment by trying to be more complex, a fact that also derived from the previously unrelated script having been adjusted to fit in the franchise mythology. Saw III, which was written by 'series' co-creator Leigh Whannell (and based, reportedly, on an idea by the first film's director/co-writer James Wan), was meant to finish the planned trilogy in a glorious way. That didn't happen, and sadly, the only one to blame is Whannell himself, despite his best efforts (he even manages to elicit some sympathy reprising his role as Adam in a harrowing flashback).This time, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) has reached the end line: his brain tumor has reduced him to near immobility, but since he still has one more game to play, he needs to stay alive for at least a few more hours. Hence his decision to have his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (Sakar Boomekh), a surgeon who has to keep the killer alive while his plan is set in motion. The caveat: she has an explosive collar attached to her neck, meaning that if Jigsaw flat-lines, she dies as well. Meanwhile, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is still missing after being kidnapped in the previous film, and a guy named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen) has to face the toughest challenge of his life: he will cross paths with three people who were more or less directly involved in his son's death and, in pure Jigsaw tradition, he will have to choose whether to save them or not.The moral question at the center of the Saw films has always been intriguing to say the least: if your life depended on it, would you sacrifice someone else? Saw III changes that format in that Jeff is in no immediate danger, but has to decide if those who are in such a situation deserve to survive. That idea is quite strong, and MacFadyen conveys the ambiguity required in those scenes with the right dose of doubt and desperation. Acting-wise, the other performances are as decent as one can expect from these movies, with Bell once again being the best of the lot, even when the role essentially demands nothing more than him lying on an operating table and explaining his view on life, death and the 'necessity' of torture.Even Bell's work, however, can't cover the weaknesses that emerge from Whannell's plotting: whereas the main storyline is, as said before, strong enough to justify the film, the flashbacks involving Wahlberg's character are nothing but a lame excuse for pointless brutality, swearing and Shawnee Smith screaming like a madman (or woman, more correctly). In fact, Smith's turn seems to have no real purpose for most of the movie (not that Amanda had any real depth previously, but that's another story). And that leads us to THE late-night conversation topic of choice when the Saw universe is involved: the final twist, which worked superbly in the first chapter, less successfully in the second and comes off as a major disappointment this time around, mainly because it contradicts Whannell's intentions - he set out to make the Saw films a complete trilogy (which is why he takes time to explain what many perceived as a plausibility error in the original movie), and yet it's obvious that his 'definitive' epilogue was going to leave the door open for further installments. As such, Saw III, while brilliantly filmed and appropriately upsetting, is the weakest link in what was meant to be a mere trilogy. There's almost a sense of cruel irony to the bit where Jigsaw, for the 'last ' time, says: 'Game over.'.5,5/10",6,0,0,5 November 2008
Ocean's Eleven," Pure, Top Class Entertainment!
","Wanna watch a movie which isn't particularly demanding, but not a shallow, no-brains blockbuster either? Then try Ocean's Eleven. It's a witty and stylish crime comedy whose purpose is solely to entertain for a couple of hours. And entertain it does.As the title suggests, the film has 11 protagonists: they're all con-men, and they're uniting for the biggest heist in history. The target? The Bellagio, a huge Las Vegas casino. The motive? None in particular, except perhaps the fact that the casino's owner, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), is dating Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts), who just happens to be team-leader Danny's (George Clooney) ex-wife. The fun can begin...The movie is a remake of a '60s Rat Pack flick, but you don't need to have seen that film, or even heard of it. Just think of the 2001 Ocean's Eleven as an ordinary action comedy, and you'll still have a great time.The screenplay has a vital role in this movie's success: the plot is expertly constructed, so that it will be captivating but not too complex, and Steven Soderbergh brings it to the screen with brilliance and elegance.But what really makes this film special is the cast: every single actor is absolutely comfortable with the various roles, and even though the focus is on some people (Clooney, Garcia, Roberts, plus Brad Pitt and Matt Damon), the other members of the ensemble (including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould) have their chance to shine too. I was particularly impressed by Garcia's performance, which somehow reminded me of his unforgettable Godfather character ('Congratulations. You're a dead man.').Highly recommended. It won't annoy you for a second.8,5/10",9,0,0,18 February 2006
Tropic Thunder," Apocalypse Whoa!
","Satirizing Hollywood is one of the oldest habits in the movie-making industry. Now, with Entourage and Extras doing a fine job on the small screen, is a bigger, meaner film version really necessary? According to Ben Stiller, writer/producer/director/star of Tropic Thunder, the answer is a resounding yes, and his gamble seems to have paid off, given his fourth directorial effort is one of the craziest, funniest comedies ever made on the subject.Stiller claims he got the idea for the film the moment he made his debut in movies, playing a supporting role in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. Not that he has anything bad to say about Spielberg: the inspiration for Tropic Thunder is rather to be found in the troubled makings of Coppola's Apocalypse Now and Michael Cimino's ill-fated Heaven's Gate, which were delivered way behind schedule and went severely over budget. Coppola's film, and war movies in general, are the pretext Stiller uses to point out how messed-up the film-making system is.Tropic Thunder recounts the attempt to complete the eponymous picture, a true story set during the Vietnam war (a brief scene from the film-within-the-film spoofs Platoon's signature moment). After four days, the production is already a month behind schedule. The reason seems to be the bitter arguments between the pompous British director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan, who may have modeled his performance on co-writer Justin Theroux's work in Mulholland Drive) and the big-name cast, introduced through fake trailers before the actual movie begins: Tugg Speedman (Stiller), an action star whose one shot at serious acting, the Forrest Gump-like Simple Jack, was a massive flop; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a foul-mouthed, heroin-addicted comedian, famous for the Fatties franchise (think The Nutty Professor with Portnoy replacing Eddie Murphy and playing multiple roles); Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), a five-time Oscar-winner whose Method madness makes De Niro look like an amateur (he undergoes a surgical operation to become African-American for the sake of a role); and Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), a talentless rapper-turned-actor. Since the frictions between Cockburn and the actors are damaging the picture, the film's screenwriter (Nick Nolte) suggest the following: dump them in the jungle all by themselves and place cameras in the trees to capture their 'performances', guerrilla-style. The director complies, only to abandon his spoiled 'disciples' in a zone controlled by a drug cartel. Naturally, Speedman assumes the criminals are just extras, and at this point it's too late to go back: the proverbial thing is about to hit the fan.Stiller's previous film as a director, Zoolander, was a PG-13 send-up of the fashion world. With the movie business, such a tame approach will never work, and that's why Tropic Thunder is a comic triumph: it goes for the full, R-rated madness and excess. How else can one depict the overblown 'achievements' of Hollywood? Nothing is sacred in the universe imagined by Stiller: alongside the usual 'troubled shoot' gags, everything else gets blasted as well: Method, Oscars, franchises, studio megalomania, Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD - you name it, you'll find it. It's all there, in a mix whose appeal lies in its explicit, fearless absurdity.The excess in style (there are more explosions in one scene than in Tony Scott's entire filmography) is complemented by the same ingredients when it comes to dialogue and acting: obviously helped by his Emmy-nominated self-deprecation in Extras, Stiller has no problem coming up with the most outrageous things for his characters to say, yet, given the context, everything sounds so alarmingly true ('I don't read scripts. The script reads me' Lazarus says). As for the performances, the leading trio couldn't have been better: Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. are always at their best when faced with larger-than-life types, the latter especially enjoying his career resurrection after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Zodiac and Iron Man (the 'never go full retard' sequence alone should get him an Oscar nomination). Nolte and Coogan deliver the expected goods too, but the best stuff in Tropic Thunder comes from those who appear less: as Speedman's moronic agent (imagine Ari Gold from Entourage and sweeten him just a little), Matthew McConaughey is really entertaining for the first time in I don't know how long, and then there's the icing on the cake, namely a certain Tom Cruise, whose four-scene appearance as a bald, overweight, sweary producer ('I will massacre you! I will f*ck you up!') almost immediately qualifies as his best work since Magnolia.Tropic Thunder is loud, overstuffed and rude, which might turn off some viewers. But hey, that's exactly the point: between the fake blood, Black convulsing, Stiller going bonkers, Downey playing an African-American and Cruise, in a fat-suit, cursing and dancing, there's not one dull moment in its 107 minutes. It's the most fun, politically incorrect comedy of 2008 - a live action equivalent of South Park.",9,1,4,13 October 2008
The Usual Suspects," The best thriller of the '90s
","The first and best reason to remember The Usual Suspects is one single line, spoken by low-level crook Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey): 'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist'. The cult phrase refers to Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal mastermind who, while unseen (or not, depending on the point of view), dominates the events of Bryan Singer's small yet massive masterpiece, the most accomplished entry in the thriller genre made during the '90s.Christopher McQuarrie's complex, intelligent and Oscar-winning script (lots of flashbacks in this one) kicks off with the final stage of a massacre, culminating in the execution of a certain Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and the explosion of the boat on which 27 people were brutally murdered. The sole survivor, the aforementioned Verbal, tells Detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone stole a truck, and five 'usual suspects' were lined up and arrested. These included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), the dim-witted McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and the latter's lover, the hard-to-understand Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, who apparently really had problems when it came to making his lines intelligible).Now, as Keaton pointed out then and Verbal points out now, the usual strategy is putting one real criminal alongside four random buffoons who practically participate in line-ups for a living. Why were those five sharing a cell, then? The answer pops up after their release: the five suspects are contacted by a sinister attorney who goes by the name Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and told that they have to fulfil an assignment for Keyser Soze, otherwise they will all die. As the story proceeds, the incredulous police come to realize they're not dealing with the usual crime, or the usual perpetrators for that matter.The film is clearly an independent production (all scenes were filmed in a limited number of locations, mostly indoors, and the director himself famously appeared in front of the camera in some of the close-ups), but it certainly thinks big, like most smaller films from the late '80s and early '90s. The title is of course an explicit homage to Casablanca, one of Singer's favorite movies, and the intricate plotting is blockbuster-worthy (if only most blockbusters were written this well). What it lacks in size it makes up for in mood and tension, both of which are provided largely through John Ottman's editing and music.The other key attraction, sort of inevitably with such a cast, is the acting: Del Toro's performance promised a very bright future (and Traffic and 21 Grams have done nothing to prove him wrong), Byrne, Baldwin and Pollak delivered the last truly memorable silver-screen work of their careers (not that Baldwin had that much to speak of in the first place), and in the crippled, verbose Kint Spacey found the perfect role to impose himself as one of the fundamental screen presences of our time. And that's without mentioning the elusive figure of Keyser Soze: whether he's physically portrayed by someone or not, he is rightfully remembered as one of the most enduring cinema villains ever created. Not bad for a guy who hardly has any screen-time at all (or does he?).Alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, The Usual Suspects qualifies as the most intelligent and enjoyable thriller of the '90s. The extra points it scores are all due to the particular nature of its 'central' villain: even more than Hannibal Lecter, Keyser Soze and his tricks won't leave your mind very easily.",10,3,5,15 September 2005
The Duchess," Beautiful to behold, but rather soulless
","When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.To secure some kudos, Dibb cast Wright's go-to leading lady Keira Knightley as the film's heroine, Georgiana Spencer, whose life changes radically when the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) asks for her hand in marriage. The quality of her lifestyle improves significantly, and all she has to do, as she's frequently reminded by her mother (Charlotte Rampling), is to be a good wife. Unfortunately, that task proves more difficult than expected, since the Duke insists on having a male heir and Georgiana keeps giving birth to boys. All that's left for the poor man is to find a mistress, who happens to be the Duchess's best (in fact, only) friend (Hayley Atwell). Georgiana would like to retaliate by having an affair with her former suitor Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), but common decency suggests she shouldn't. Why? Because she's just a woman.Unhappy marriage, sex seen as a mere reproductive device, lust for freedom, society of the past seen as a mirror of contemporary events. Sound familiar? yes, the blueprint is obviously Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, a far superior period piece that manages to speak to the audiences of today. Coppola did that thanks to the soundtrack, which emphasized the idea of the Queen of France being a rebellious teenager; Dibb's approach involves parallels with Georgiana's famous descendant, Princess Diana, as well as a political subtext suggesting the Duchess was one of the world's first feminists. Fair enough, as long as he has the substance to back that up. Does he? No. He puts all his energy in highlighting the natural beauty of 18th century England, and in that sense the movie can be mentioned in the same breath as Room with a View or Howard's End. Elsewhere, though, it's pretty basic, with a story that's been told many times before and has no new twists that can add to its dramatic resonance.The performances are another problem altogether: Knightley might have seemed like a perfect fit for the role and she tries her utter best, but it feels quite theatrical (in a bad way) and overstated, and sh isn't helped by Atwell and Cooper's emotionless staring as support. Fiennes and Rampling, on the other hand, are amazing, especially the former's apparently cold but really entertaining and moving performance - if Bill Murray did period dramas, it would look a lot like that. It's also a bit ironic: the film aims to be female-driven, but is completely stolen by a man.",6,11,15,31 December 2008
Die Hard 2," A slight step down from the original, but still a good action flick
","Ah, Die Hard, that great action movie starring Bruce Willis which gave the genre the shot in the arm it needed: after the likes of Rambo and The Terminator, the '80s ended with a reluctant hero who was every bit as vulnerable as the average citizen and, most crucially, eager to just get home and relax. Two years later, this guy came back for more, albeit once again against his will.This time around, the trouble ensues at an airport, where John McClane (Willis) is waiting for his wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Everything's all right until a gang of mercenaries, led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), takes control of the airport's communications system and keep all the planes circling in the air until they can get the convicted General Esperanza (Franco Nero) out of the United States. With only 58 minutes left before the aircrafts run out of fuel and the authorities incapable of doing anything, McClane decides to take the matter in his own hands, much to the despair of the uptight Captain Lorenzo (NYPD Blue's Dennis Franz). This means there will be more shooting, more explosions, more blood and more 'yippee-ki-yay, motherf**ker!'.By setting the second Die Hard (also known as Die Harder) in an airport, Finnish director Renny Harlin is able to stage bigger and louder set-pieces than John McTiernan did in the first film, and while one of the main charms of the original was the down-to-earth action, Harlin's material never feels overblown or out of place. Why? Because unlike the action sequences, McClane hasn't changed that much: he'd still rather be at home with his wife and kids than battle terrorists all by himself, and yet there he is, getting beaten up to ensure hundreds of people won't die. It is the decision to remain faithful to the character's nature, combined with Willis'charisma, that makes Die Hard 2 as fun and exciting as its predecessor.If there has to be a (minor) complaint, it involves the villains: Sadler is a menacing presence, that's undeniable, but he doesn't appear in enough scenes to make as memorable an impression as Alan Rickman did in the first film. By the time he is face to face with Willis, however, it doesn't matter anymore: the final showdown is so spectacular all Die Hard fans should forget the fact the bad guy's role was underwritten and just sit down and cheer as McClane saves the day again.In short: loved Die Hard? Then the sequel should be a great experience too (shame Harlin hasn't done anything as good since, though).8,5/10",9,0,2,13 June 2007
Quantum of Solace," The name's still Craig...
","For forty years, the line 'The name's Bond, James Bond' was a gimmick, a nice tradition that was carried on from actor to actor (and from generation to generation). However, the use of that sentence at the end of the superb Casino Royale was more of a necessity, for two reasons: a) that film was all about Bond becoming who he is today; b) it was Daniel Craig's way to prove the naysayers wrong regarding his ability to play the role. As such, there's no need for him to say it in Quantum of Solace: we already know he is James Bond.Being the first direct sequel in the franchise's history, Quantum begins exactly where Royale ended, with the grief-stricken 007 kidnapping a certain Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) to find out more about the death of his beloved Vesper. After a pulse-stopping car chase on Lake Como in Italy, he learns the following: White works for an organization known as Quantum, which makes deals with all kinds of people for profit's sake. If Bond wants a definitive answer to his questions, he must find the real brains behind Quantum, the sleazy Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). In order to do so, though, he has no choice but to go rogue, since M (Judi Dench) is justifiably convinced he is driven by a pure desire of revenge. And so begins a chase around the world, with our favorite spy's only allies being the beautiful and angry Camille (Olga Kurylenko), who's after Greene for personal reasons as well, René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), the only man in the business whose allegiance isn't in question, and good old Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who doesn't give a damn about the CIA's orders to protect Greene and kill Bond.Even more than Casino Royale, Quantum is heavily indebted to the Bourne trilogy, with the hectic camera-work and amazing stunts (the whole first act tops anything in Royale), which could have been a liability in the hands of new director Marc Forster, an action ignoramus who prefers character-driven dramas (Monster's Ball is the prime example). But, with the new century and the Cold War long gone, that's exactly what the series has become, also thanks to Paul Haggis's scripting inputs: what matters is Bond himself, nothing else. And what is he like? Well, he's still edgy, impulsive, emotional, with no fine taste when it comes to drinks (he just gets drunk) and no interest in bedding every woman he sees. In other words, he's human, and that's where Craig's battered, vulnerable performance really shows its best side, bringing out something viewers had never seen in previous films, even, dare I say it, the ones starring Sean Connery (the closest anyone ever came to a similar result was George Lazenby in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and we all know that didn't end well, despite the film's quality). Even the action scenes are beyond pure spectacle because they are vital to finding the essence of the character.This being a Forster & Haggis picture, it also means the story is suited to fit our times instead of providing overly implausible sci-fi scenarios (read: the ice palace and invisible car in Die Another Day): the sociological theme, unheard of thus far for a Bond movie, is the environment, and how businessmen are ruining it to make money. It's not very original, but with the right approach and characters it works: Greene, as far as that matter is concerned, isn't just a great villain as played by the talented Amalric, he's also a believable one - no world domination or other overblown stuff on his agenda, just plain and simple financial security, much like Le Chiffre in the previous installment. Kurylenko does a remarkable job too, giving depth and charm to the latest Bond girl in the same way Eva Green did before her, and the established cast (Dench, Giannini, Wright) is spot-on as expected.A perfect sequel, then? Not quite: for one thing, Gemma Arterton's presence is basically an excuse to insert references to a few classic Bond moments, Goldfinger especially (she has a nice name, though), and the climax, while realistically huge, is a bit rushed and unsatisfactory (perhaps because Haggis did the last rewrite with the writers' strike just behind the corner), but then again it is hard to top the exquisite last act of Casino Royale. Whatever defects Quantum of Solace has, though, should not be taken as a sign of the usual drop in quality kicking in gradually. It may lack some of its predecessor's extra punch, but it has emotion, excitement, and humor that make up for any minor losses. In the end, it's just what people expected: Ian Fleming's James Bond. And when he returns, there will be more of the same.",8,2,5,10 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Decent middle section in an otherwise messy smack-down
","After loads of comic-books and video-games, it was only a matter of time before Alien vs. Predator made it to the big screen. Of course, the task was always going to be risky, given Predator 2 was largely ignored during its original release and Alien: Resurrection is unanimously despised by all fans of the face-hugging monster. That Sigourney Weaver and, allegedly, Ridley Scott condemned the operation before filming had even begun made things worse, as did the news that the movie would be written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, a competent visualist but a terrible screenwriter (as the Resident Evils testify). In the end, what emerged is neither the complete disaster expected by sceptics nor the great action/horror movie AVP devotees were hoping for: it is a film that, despite having some good set-pieces, leaves the viewer with the impression that the magic of both franchises' early years is largely missing.To be fair, Anderson does try to come up with a decent excuse for pairing sci-fi's most popular mass-murdering extra-terrestrials. In fact, the idea itself is not that bad: expanding on some loose threads from the original films, the story sees Predators as creatures who have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. Apparently, it is they who taught us how to build pyramids, in exchange for a few humans to sacrifice: every five centuries or so, they would serve as hosts for Alien eggs, which would later spawn grown-up victims for the Predator's rite of passage. One of the locations for these rites is a pyramid in Antarctica, and a mysterious heat wave originating from it has attracted a group of scientists led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), co-founder of the Company seen in the Alien franchise. Naturally, there is no time to say 'Something's wrong!' before the major bloodbath begins.Actually, there is very little blood in the movie: whereas all other entries in both franchises were proud to boast an R-rating that enabled them to do almost anything (Predators skinning their victims, for example), AVP suffers from a PG-13 which was imposed by the studio for commercial reasons and seriously dampens the fun: sure, the two monsters kicking the crap out of each other are fun to watch, but where is the brutality both species crave and deserve? Even worse than the lack of explicit violence is the character development: James Cameron's Aliens is justly famous for how the director carefully crafted each of the human players and made Ellen Ripley more than just another scream queen (hell, how many science-fiction flicks can brag about receiving an Oscar nomination for the female protagonist?); this movie's heroine, played by Sanaa Lathan, is likable but nothing else, and the rest of the cast, mostly comprised of nobodys (apart from Ewen Bremner), is just a bunch of expendable idiots. The biggest disappointment is Henriksen: chosen deliberately to remind viewers of his role(s) in Aliens and Alien 3 (Charles Bishop is the man on whom the androids were based), he has absolutely nothing to do but stare at random and look concerned. Even a gratuitous reference to the knife scene in Cameron's film fails to give the slightest thrill.On the flip-side, AVP is a good-looking picture - not as gorgeous as Ridley Scott's work, but fluid and slick enough to ensure boredom rarely kicks in. The highlight is a flashback showing how the battle began, but such scenes occur far too seldom to make this an above-average experience.'Whoever wins, we lose' said the tag-line. After seeing the movie, it's more like 'Whoever wins, we don't care'.5,5/10",6,1,2,27 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," Mesmerizing - an instant classic!
","Since 1984, the Coen brothers have been seducing, entrancing and surprising film-lovers all over the world with their wildly imaginative body of work, or at least they did until 2003. Then came Intolerable Cruelty, followed by The Ladykillers: not bad movies per se, but clearly not the best of efforts on their behalf. Thankfully, No Country for Old Men is everything one could expect from them. In fact, it's their best film since Fargo, a fact acknowledged by the three Oscars they won (Best Picture, Directing and Adapted Screenplay).Hang on. Adapted? Yes. Surprisingly enough, the brothers' return to form is not a product of their remarkable imagination. Instead, it is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, albeit one that seems to be tailor-made for the Coens: Texas (where their debut Blood Simple was set), colorful characters, impeccable dialogue and occasional outbursts of violence - it's all there, complete with a sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones' Ed Tom Bell) whose reactions to the ensuing madness are modeled on Fargo's Marge Gunderson.It is Bell that constitutes the film's soul: his words open and close the story, and his candid reflections on mankind are the center of No Country's analysis of absurd bloodshed. The latter is prominently caused by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a passionless killer who is hired to find Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who has come across a suitcase containing two million dollars after discovering a drug affair gone horribly bad and decides to keep running despite the warnings of a more suave hit-man (Woody Harrelson): Chigurh will stop at nothing, and proof of that is evident in the trail of corpses he has left behind with a cattle gun. Bell always arrives too late to where either of the two men has been, and can only hope the violence will stop some day. Yes, it really is no country for old men.This film marks a return to the Coens' typically humorous and noirish settings, while also adding an elegiac beauty, captured by Roger Deakins' seductive cinematography, which reminds of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns: the Texan landscapes provide a sense of timelessness that makes the brutality reflect human history altogether, rather than a specific period (although the movie takes place in 1980). The environment is also used to set the film's tone, especially in terms of sound: Carter Burwell's magnificent music is heard only four or five times in the whole picture, leaving room for the wind that blows swiftly across the desert and announces awful things to come.Along with the formal beauty, the Coens, as always, offer excellent performances: Jones provides a soulful variation of a part he could play in his sleep by now, his Sheriff being the only real 'good guy' around; Brolin, for whom 2007 was a breakthrough year (Grindhouse, In the Valley of Elah, American Gangster), is laconic and instantly charismatic as he moves the action forward and says some of the fantastic screenplay's best lines ('If I don't come back, tell mother I love her'. 'Your mother is dead' his wife remarks. 'Well, then I'll tell her myself' he replies); and Bardem, who won the film's fourth Oscar (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), is nothing short of a revelation, trading his natural likability for a frightening coldness (and a ridiculous hairdo) that marks Chigurh as the most iconic hit-man in cinema history - like Ben Kingsley, who shocked everyone with his raw turn in Sexy Beast, the Spanish actor has undergone a transformation so scary some viewers won't believe it's the same person who made the world cry in Before Night Falls and The Sea Inside.Bottom line: No Country for Old Men is quintessential Coen: funny, poetic, violent and tragic. In other words, a masterpiece.",10,2,7,25 February 2008
District 9," Alien immigration
","Try picturing this: you're a visual effects artist and aspiring filmmaker, and your work has caught the right person's eye, so much that said person gives you the chance to direct a highly anticipated video game-based movie. For various reasons, the project falls apart, but instead of leaving you empty-handed, that same person gives you a useful sum of money to make any picture you want. Doesn't happen every day, does it? Which is what makes District 9 such a terrific achievement: shot for only 30 million dollars after the proposed Halo film was shelved, it was made simply because producer Peter Jackson (yes, the man who made a certain Oscar-winning trilogy) believed in the talent of first-time director Neill Blomkamp. The finished product proves his faith wasn't misplaced.Based on Blomkamp's earlier short film, Alive in Joburg, the movie's faux-documentary storytelling focuses on a tricky situation taking place in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa: for twenty years, a spaceship has been standing still in the sky above the city, while the aliens that came with it are forced to live in a slum called District 9. Cruelly mocked by the locals, who call them 'prawns', the only reason they are still alive and well is they possess technology the army and the MNU (Multi-National United) find interesting. One day, however, the creatures are meant to be evicted, and during the procedure one particularly ambitious but dimwitted MNU employee, Wikus van der Werve (Sharlto Copley), is infected with a substance that slowly starts transforming him into an alien. As his condition worsens, he must collaborate with the 'prawns' if he ever wishes to become normal again.What strikes the most about District 9 is that, unlike most science fiction films, it focuses on ideas rather than impressive effects: undoubtedly due in part to the low budget, this enables Blomkamp to deliver an anti-blockbuster that is really about people, not aliens. Following his own Alive in Joburg template, he goes for a hand-held, gritty, fast-paced style and chose to shoot the entire film on location in his home town for a very specific reason: look past the fact that the slum is inhabited by extra-terrestrials, and this could easily be a documentary about life during apartheid (something Blomkamp experienced). The use of science fiction as an allegory isn't anything new (after all, the word 'alien' derives from the Latin 'alienus', which means 'other' or 'different'), but in the decrepit locales of District 9 it becomes frighteningly real. The unique setting is also a refreshing change of scenery after countless UFO stories set in America (remember the gag in Monsters vs. Aliens?).Another kicker, perhaps more impressive than the bold screenplay and direction, is Copley's central performance, and not just because his character undergoes a truly moving, Cronenbergian transformation (echoes of The Fly are evident throughout). No, the astonishing thing about his work is that, for one thing, he'd never acted before (minus a cameo as a sniper in Alive in Joburg), and, on top of it all, he improvised every single line, which explains why, like in Judd Apatow's body of work, every other sentence is deliciously profane (and the South African accent makes it even funnier). And for those worrying about the budget's impact on any set-pieces, rest assured: Wikus's metamorphosis from human to alien is matched by the film's move to recognizable sci-fi elements (although still done intelligently), including a climactic battle that is scaled down compared to, say, Transformers, but pretty spectacular nonetheless (not to mention refreshingly bloody).In short, District 9 is a miracle of sorts: a small sci-fi movie that thinks big, delivering the goods whilst keeping its focus firmly on storytelling and thematic relevance first, and action second. A stunning piece of work.",9,1,5,6 March 2010
Mamma Mia!," Meryl Streep is the dancing queen!
","Like most musicals, Mamma Mia! does nothing to hide its blatantly artificial nature: it's a collection of intermittently enjoyable songs by the Swedish pop group ABBA and deliberately ridiculous coreographies, all woven together by a thin yet somehow plausible 'plot' and carried by a committed cast. It's silliness for its own sake, and most of the time it actually works.The story unfolds on a Greek island where a young girl, Sophie (the lovely Amanda Seyfried), is about to marry her beloved Sky (Dominic Cooper), her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) and her 'aunts' (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) being in charge of making everything perfect. Only Sophie's father is missing, and for a very good reason: not even Donna knows who he is! Nevertheless, Sophie manages to retrieve her mother's diary and finds three potential dads thanks to it: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth) and Bill Andersson (Stellan Skarsgård). Not knowing which one to invite, she makes sure all three of them show up. And as the titular song goes, here we go again...The plot is, of course, utterly ludicrous, its sole function being to act as an introduction for the musical numbers (this has to do with the fact that the original stage version was created around the pre-existing songs). The singing and dancing is the movie's sole reason to exist, and there it has both its strength and its undoing: unlike, say, Chicago, it manages to retain its wild energy during the music-free 'interludes', but unlike Chicago it also suffers from having set-ups of varying interest. Basically, it boils down to this: whenever Streep, who sings like an angel, or Brosnan, in his best non-Bond role to date, are involved, there is nothing better; otherwise, it's pretty much hit and miss (with more hisses than hits, unfortunately).Overall, this isn't a movie people will remember with the same fondness as they do Moulin Rouge or The Sound of Music, but its delightful silliness, largely spot-on humor and exhilarating performances are enough to keep everyone entertained for a couple of hours.",7,1,2,30 July 2008
Batman Begins," Wow!!!!!
","Forget Joel Schumacher's camp, crappy Batman. Actually, with all due respect, forget Tim Burton's moody, dark take on the hero, too: this is the Batman film fans have been waiting for ever since Bob Kane created the character in 1939. Burton's movies were great in terms of atmosphere and mood, but still left us with some questions: why did Bruce Wayne become Batman? What made him choose a bat as his symbol? Where did he get all his gadgets from? Christopher Nolan answers all these questions in a gritty, realistic superhero opus that combines a big budget, an uncompromised directorial vision and some of the best writing and acting the genre's ever seen.The story (written by Nolan and David 'Blade' Goyer) focuses on Bruce Wayne (a superb Christian Bale) returning to Gotham City after a very long time spent abroad, trying to find himself and learning martial arts from Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson,excellent). While trying to get his company back, he also decides to fight crime in order to avenge the murder of his parents, but he can't do it as a normal guy. He has to become something else, a symbol or, as Ducard put it, a legend. Hence the Batsuit: 'Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread.'. The script is bulletproof, much like Batman's costume, and so is the look of the film: Nolan, an experienced director of psychological thrillers (Memento and Insomnia), takes inspiration from Burton's brooding aesthetic but tones it down a notch, keeping the movie firmly rooted in a world that is as real as possible (the only hint of grandeur is contained in the music, a masterclass in film scoring that stems from the combined effort of Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard).For the same reason, all the characters are undeniably human: sure, Bruce Wayne does dress as a bat, but he has a plausible reason for doing so, and his gadgets, designed by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), are all based on existing military technology - there's no James Bond extravaganza here. Rather than the Justice League or, even worse, Robin, sidekicks are limited to the indispensable Alfred (Michael Caine, brilliant as usual) and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, same as Caine), with a little help from Katie Holmes (not bad, actually) as a potential love interest. Even the villains are, by superhero standards, normal, Tom Wilkinson being particularly great to watch as an Italian-American mob boss. Granted, there is a slight concession to Burton's typical imagery in the form of the demented Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy, best Bat-nemesis since Jack Nicholson), but just like the rest of the film, it works astoundingly well.Verdict: quite simply the best superhero movie ever and the best film of summer 2005. I'm already waiting for the sequel.",10,8,12,31 August 2005
28 Days Later...," A compelling, artful, very British take on the zombie genre
","Having made his name with dark, grotesque comedies or dramas like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, Danny Boyle didn't seem like an obvious choice for directing a zombie movie. But then again, appearances can be deceiving, and as it turns out, Boyle's gritty, low-budget take on the genre is one of the best horror films to have been produced in the last decade.In fact, the Z-word (as it's lovingly referred to in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead) is never used in the film, perhaps because the director prefers not to call his work a 'zombie film'. Instead, the undead are called 'infected', as the whole story begins with a raid in a lab, where a very powerful virus is accidentally released. At this point, the scene fades to black, followed by the caption '28 days later...' (hence the title). And that's when the movie really kicks in: an average Brit named Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a deserted hospital and goes out in the street to look for help, only to find the whole of London completely abandoned (a truly unsettling sequence), safe for the infected, constantly running (maybe that's where Zack Snyder came up with the idea of fast zombies in the Dawn of the Dead remake) in search of human flesh. Having been saved by the disillusioned (and very tough) Selena (Naomie Harris), Jim decides to join her and her allies in an attempt to find a place where a peaceful life is still an option.At this point, the second part of the movie begins: Jim, Selena and the others run into a bunch of soldiers (led by Christopher Eccleston), who live completely isolated in a military zone while waiting for the situation to improve. At first, the survivors have nothing against staying there. Soon enough, though, they will realize that maybe it isn't the infected they should fear the most, as a dramatic battle for everyone's life starts to take shape...One of the main strengths of 28 Days Later... is Boyle's unpretentious, realistic approach: the hand-held cameras add to the eerie mood, particularly in the film's first half, giving us an otherworldly, but at the same time believable portrait of a dystopian, gloomy England. Also important is the attention to character: where most movies focus on the action scenes, the Trainspotting director is more interested in establishing plausible, affecting relationships between the people he's observing, and in that he is helped by a committed cast, especially Murphy and Harris (plus Brendan Gleeson in a brief, but exhilarating appearance). It is in fact largely thanks to the actors that Boyle manages to get away with a fairly conventional third act (heavily inspired by George Romero's Day of the Dead) and villains that would look stereotyped if played by lesser thespians.Overall it does have a few flaws, but 28 Days Later... is nonetheless a compelling film, and arguably the most interesting British contribution to the horror genre since The Wicker Man.",9,1,2,22 April 2007
Cars," Not the best of the Pixar movies, but nonetheless an above-the-average animated hit
","Cars, Pixar's seventh feature-length picture, sees the return behind the camera of John Lasseter, the animation guru who gave us Toy Story, its sequel and A Bug's Life. Like the latter, Cars is slightly sub-par if compared to the rest of Pixar's production, mostly because of the not so original story.The film revolves around Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a cocky race car (his last name is a reference to an animator, though one could easily think of Steve McQueen as well) who has finally received the opportunity of a lifetime: to compete in the Piston Cup final against the current champion and another fame-obsessed vehicle, the obnoxious Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). While he's trying to reach the city where the race is held, however, Lightning gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, a small town that has been forgotten for a long time. Since he caused some damage while attempting to get back on the highway, he's forced to stay there and fix the mess. As time goes by, our hero will realize life isn't all about winning, a lesson learned with the help of former champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).Technically speaking, Cars is an amazing film, with an attention to detail rarely seen in family movies. Some shots are even so realistic it almost looks like a live-action feature rather than a cartoon (the opening sequence has a really palpable tension). Being this Pixar, there are also the usual funny in-jokes (a brilliant scene spoofing Toy Story, A Bug's Life and Monsters, Inc.) and clever voice casting, in particular Jeremy Piven, who basically reprises his Emmy-winning Entourage role (minus the swearing, of course), playing McQueen's agent, and Paul Newman, once again (see The Color of Money) playing the wise mentor who makes the protagonist discover the true values of life (and let's not forget the sports-linked celebrity cameos, such as F1 champion Michael Schumacher playing a Ferrari). Still, there's a little something missing, that unique Pixar touch that made other movies totally unpredictable. The romance between Lightning and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) feels like a deja vu, as does his friendship with the hilarious Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and by the time he enters the race he's been pursuing the whole time it's quite easy to figure out what's gonna happen next (A Bug's Life, while very enjoyable, suffered from a similar script-related issue). This minor flaw prevents Cars from being an instant classic, but it remains an exhilarating experience, and those who truly appreciate good animation will have a great time watching it.",8,0,2,22 December 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Kung fu at its most poetic and beautiful
","If you like martial arts flicks, you just have to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's so incredibly good, it made me fall in love with Asian cinema.Ang Lee's Oscar-winning magnum opus succeeds where most similar movies failed: to keep the personal, intimate story and the awesome, huge action on the same level, never letting one prevail on the other. The beautifully choreographed duels are exactly as important as the dialogue-heavy intermissions (or maybe the fights are intermissions). Think Lawrence of Arabia, only with small fights in the forest instead of massive combats in the desert.The locations where the characters fight are a crucial part of the film's greatness: never has a duel looked so beautiful as when two people follow each other jumping from tree to tree, their movements so gracious and the combat itself so elegant and bloodless. It's like The Matrix in terms of visual delight, but more poetic.The acting is perfect as well: Chow Yun-Fat is excellent in the unusual role of the retired warrior who is reluctantly forced back into action, Michelle Yeoh is of good support as his would-be love interest, and it's no wonder Ziyi Zhang has become one of the most wanted actresses in the world. She's astounding, playing such a layered character so well at such a young age.Beautiful and tragic, it's something you just have to see. As soon as you possibly can.",10,13,21,30 January 2006
2012," The Apocalypse according to Emmerich...
","If there's one thing Roland Emmerich knows, it's how to destroy things. Exhibit A: the White House in Independence Day, New York in Godzilla and The Day after Tomorrow, the prehistoric genre in 10.000 BC. It is only fitting, then, that his last big disaster movie - his words, not mine - should revolve around the ultimate catastrophe: the end of the world. Unsurprisingly, his take on the subject isn't very subtle. On the other hand, it's a shockingly dull affair.Based on the theory that the world will end in the year 2012 (a Mayan 'prophecy' that also served as a major plot point in the finale of The X-Files), the movie provides some pseudo-scientific explanation for everything going down the drain, then proceeds to tell the 'proper' story: politicians and (rich) businessmen are preparing some sort of survival plan, scientists look on as things escalate sooner than predicted and common men like Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer who happens to be vacationing with what remains of his family, try to get their sorry behinds some place safe. Not the easiest of tasks...From a purely aesthetic point of view, Emmerich really tops himself this time: impeccable visual effects merge with a truly apocalyptic vision as California sinks into the ocean, a giant tidal wave covers the Himalayas and the White House gets destroyed (again). And yet, as that last example suggests, it's all stuff we've seen before, a greatest hits compilation that strives to be better than the sum of its parts. The film is also marred by a tedious sense of repetition, its 160 minutes being divided in the following sections: people escaping annihilation by car (first hour), plane (second hour) and finally boat (last 40 minutes). Fifteen minutes, it already starts looking like bland levels of a video game.Of course, it doesn't fare much better in terms of narrative: not only is the film filled with obvious and annoying religious symbolism (see the fate of the Vatican), we also have every single cast member stuck with a role so basic the script could have been written by a 7-year old. Cusack tries his best doing the usual stuff, as do Amanda Peet (his ex-wife), Chiwetel Ejofor (a scientist) and Thandie Newton (the President's daughter), but it's painfully clear where the movie is going when even Oliver Platt is on tired autopilot. Only Danny Glover (the President) and Woody Harrelson (a hippie prophet) are able to elicit some sympathy, and, naturally, their screen-time is criminally short.To sum it all up, 2012 is a massive undertaking, worth watching for its ambition and its use of special effects. However, as blockbusters and disaster movies come, it is a disappointment on every other level. But at least it's less cheesy than Michael Bay's Armageddon.",5,0,1,29 May 2010
Ghost Rider," Occasionally dumb, sometimes ridiculous, but most of the time fun as hell (pun not intended)
","This film was never going to be a masterpiece in comic-book adaptation. Where other Marvel-based movies (Spider-Man, X-Men etc.) focused on their protagonists'inner struggles, it was clear from the earliest teaser that Ghost Rider had no such ambitions; it was just going to be a loud, hopefully watchable action movie. And that's exactly what it is.However, writer/director Mark Steven Johnson (who previously explored comic-book territory in the flawed, but somehow underrated Daredevil) deserves credit for trying to provide us with a believable back-story for this unusual character. Shame it's all stuff we've seen before (an unbearable loss and its life-altering consequences), the only variation being the contract young Johnny Blaze signs with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) to save Blaze Sr. 's life. Predictably, the old man dies anyway, leaving Johnny (Nicolas Cage) alone and forced to serve the dark forces: by day, he's an ordinary man who earns his living by impressing people with his motorcycle stunts; by night, on the other hand, he becomes the Ghost Rider, an avenger who punishes evildoers by making them feel the same pain they have inflicted upon their victims. Naturally, his nocturnal persona isn't the kind of guy who walks unnoticed (how could he, his face being a flaming skull?), and so he will also have to deal with the authorities. Oh, and then there's Blackheart (Wes Bentley), a rogue demon who's trying to take over the world. You know, business as usual.Knowing that any psychological digressions would be a waste of time, Johnson puts all his energy into the action sequences, and that's where the film truly succeeds: whenever the Rider gets on the motorbike and starts causing all kinds of mayhem, it's easy to see why comic-book readers are fascinated by a character who, unlike Spidey and friends, isn't afraid to get his hands dirty, no matter what (including a skyscraper) comes in his way. Ghost Rider is an uncompromising bad-ass, and Cage has a lot of fun playing him, although even he struggles to keep a straight face while delivering the line 'I sold my soul to the Devil'. And speaking of devils, the villains are actually the main reason the film occasionally clunks: while the riotous Fonda is a joy to watch (the Easy Rider in-joke being the stand-out), the same can't be said of Bentley, who swaps the chilling subtlety he mastered in American Beauty for stereotyped overacting (but then again, what else can you do when you've got the most ridiculous lines and sidekicks since Batman & Robin?). Another weak element, though not as dull as Bentley, is the romantic subplot involving Eva Mendes, primarily because even the most inexperienced moviegoer is able to guess the outcome.Final verdict? Well, romance and bad guys aside, Ghost Rider is fun, especially when the titular character is let loose in the second half of the film. Certainly not among the year's best movies, but worth a look on your average Saturday night.6,5/10",6,2,3,18 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men: The End?
","The best and most emotional movie of the trilogy. This is what the director, Brett Ratner, and the actors involved have said of X-Men: The Last Stand. This year's Revenge of the Sith? Not really: it's not as astonishing as the final Star Wars chapter (or, staying in X-Men territory, the amazing second installment), but it has the degree of spectacular that makes it count as a solid franchise epilogue (assuming it really is the last film in the series, that is).The Last Stand's premise is based on a recent X-Men storyline written by Joss 'Buffy' Whedon: we learn of the existence of a young mutant(Cameron Bright, aka the 'creepy boy' from Godsend and Birth), whose very particular 'gift' is to make other mutants powerless if they're too close to him. So far, though, the loss is temporary. If, however, you receive the 'cure', obtained from the boy's DNA, you will become 'normal'. Forever.This discovery causes three main reactions: some mutants, including Angel (Ben Foster), a winged teenager whose father financed the making of the 'cure', and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who, because of her abilities, can't even kiss or touch her boyfriend, see it as a miracle; Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, particularly Storm (Halle Berry), think it's ridiculous, given being a mutant isn't a disease you can just get rid of; and then we have Magneto (Ian McKellen), who immediately realizes the truth: let the humans have it their way, and the mutant race will be completely and irreversibly exterminated. Which means, the ultimate war is about to begin. In addition, the X-Men have to deal with another issue: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, at her best), back from the dead and more powerful than ever (she's a Level 5 mutant, virtually invincible, whereas Xavier and Magneto are Level 4). In fact, her personality has been replaced by a more aggressive one known as the Phoenix. Translation: the proverbial thing is going to hit the fan.The main pre-release complaint made by fans was the departure of director Bryan Singer, who moved on to resurrecting Superman on the big screen. His replacement, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner, maintains the same tone and, like Singer, aims for something a bit more breathtaking in scale compared to the previous film. Starting with a Danger Room sequence, blatantly inspired by the famous Days of a Future Past storyline, and tying the two plot arcs (The Cure and the Dark Phoenix Saga) together in an epic confrontation as good as anything Singer would have come up with, he manages to deliver action and suspense without sacrificing the story's heart for the sake of comedy (as seen in the Rush Hours). Actually, sometimes the action overshadows parts of the story, with key subplots from previous installments - the Rogue-Iceman situation most notably - being sidestepped to make room for new characters (not that it's a bad thing, when you have someone like Kelsey Grammar playing Beast). This, paired with a running time that is, astonishingly enough, shorter than that of X2, means that while the overall result is pretty satisfying, there are some specific sections that could have used more work.Bottom line: this might not be the last official X-Men film (the last two scenes, one of which plays after the closing credits, seem to suggest a fourth chapter is possible), but if it is, it's a worthy, if not entirely accomplished swansong. Then again, asking a new director to outdo someone else's work is a pretty big challenge, so Ratner deserves credit for accepting the challenge and delivering an intelligent, exciting summer blockbuster - an X-flick worthy of the name.",7,1,5,27 May 2006
Hellboy," He'll always look this good
","2004 was an interesting year for comic book movies: on quite opposing sides we had Spieder-Man 2, still the best superhero movie after Chris Nolan's vision of Batman, and Catwoman, a new low point for the genre seven years after Batman & Robin. There was also The Punisher, a fun but rather conventional flick which passed by rather unnoticed, and Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro's pet project, a film he'd been dying to make ever since he first read Mike Mignola's original comics. Now, this first crack at Dark Horse's antihero doesn't come off as a very personal piece of work (something Sam Raimi mastered to perfection with the second Spidey movie), but it's impressive nonetheless (plus, how often does one get the original author to contribute to the screenplay?).Based largely on the classic story The Seed of Destruction, the film begins in 1944, when Nazi officer Kroenen and mad monk Rasputin try to summon the forces of Hell to defeat the Allies. The ritual goes awry, and out of Hell comes simply a scared little demon child. The little fella is adopted by Professor Broom (John Hurt), whose reassuring voice guides us through that introductory sequence.Sixty years later, Broom is one of the fundamental elements of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), a covert organization that fights supernatural creatures. Or, as the Professor himself explains to the newly arrived Agent Myers (Rupert Evans): 'There are things that bump in the night, Agent Myers. And we are those who bump back.'. The bumping in question is provided by an elite team supervised by Broom: Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, with the voice provided by David Hyde Pierce, aka Niles Crane), an amphibian with some kind of telepathic/empathetic gift linked to his 'hands'; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a sweet-looking girl who has the ability to 'be on fire'; and of course Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the now grown-up demon whose disregard for rules or subtlety is a constant pain in the ass for Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), the man in charge of keeping the BPRD hidden from the public. It won't prove that easy when a new disaster is about to happen, one that could have to do with Hellboy's oldest enemies.The story is pretty basic, with the big exception of Hellboy being anything but your average 'superhero': he's rude, smokes cigars, has a passion for kicking monster ass and greets most situations with the line 'Oh, crap!'. It's that uniqueness that got del Toro hooked in the first place, along with the imagery that accompanied such a character. As such, the film is extremely accomplished from a visual standpoint, although the director doesn't go all the way, probably because he is 'stuck' with the duty of telling the classic origin story without taking things too far (it's easy to imagine studio executives saying: 'Let's save that for the sequels, shall we?'), which means his traditional iconography, linked to ancient myths, is practically absent the whole time.Compensation comes in terms of characterization: Perlman, who was the director's (and Mignola's) first and only choice for the title role (everyone else objected), delivers the goods with a bad-ass performance that sets the old red one apart from other 'superheroes' while still giving him a rough charm that makes it easy to like him. Jones and Pierce's joined effort is also an admirable achievement, not to mention proof of del Toro's wisdom in having the main characters achieved through classic makeup, not CGI. Hurt and Tambor are the usual quality gu arantee in the limited time given to them, and Blair isn't that bad either (her screen-time is a bit mistreated, though). Evans, however, is a problem, his role lacking any real substance (how many times has the new-guy's-point-of-view gimmick been used?), but the aforementioned actors, plus a really terrifying villain (that would be Kroenen), manage to make is presence less irritating than it already is.So, not exactly the triumph del Toro or fans hoped for, but a solid enough promise of greater things to come, just like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man.",8,0,0,22 October 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...
","Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got 'ambiguity' and 'unreliability' written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his 'preccciousssss' back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.",9,4,4,12 December 2005
Schindler's List," Spielberg's most powerful movie
","Prior to making Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg was known for Close Ecounters, E.T. and the Indiana Jones films - not exactly the kind of resumé studios would trust when searching for the ideal guy to direct a Holocaust drama. Then again, Scorsese passed on the project because he felt only a Jewish filmmaker could get it right (plus, he was still recovering from the controversy surrounding The Last Temptation of Christ), Billy Wilder said he was too old (but he did contribute to a first draft of the screenplay) and Roman Polanski stated he just wasn't ready to face his childhood nightmares yet (he did nine years later with The Pianist). Spielberg received a lot of criticism before the film was released, purely because of his back catalogue. Of course, it is now a fact he proved everyone wrong with what can be considered the best, most affecting of his serious movies.Based on Thomas Keneally's bestseller (deftly adapted by Steven Zaillian), the film tells one of the most amazing true stories of our time, one that stands out as a testament to courage and selflessness in a time as brutal and inhuman as World War II. The story is that of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who first came across the 'Jewish situation' in Hitler's Germany when he decided to employ Jews in his factory in order to save money. He wasn't an outspoken anti-Semite, nor did he oppose the Nazi regime - to him, it was all about business. Case in point: when he first meets his new assistant (Ben Kingsley) and the latter says he's a Jew, Schindler's matter-of-fact answer is: 'And I'm a German.'.The famous list doesn't enter the game until much later, when the cynical businessman witnesses the horrors perpetrated by the SS, particularly the stunningly cruel Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and decides to use all his power and influence to save as many innocent lives as possible. His actions, which could have cost him his life had he been discovered, will go down in history as one of the most extraordinary events of all time.If told the wrong way, Schindler's story would have ruined Spielberg's career. Luckily, the director made the wisest choice possible, opting for a documentary-like approach to the material: the film is shot in grainy black-and-white, as if it were a newsreel from that period, and the realism is most evident in the concentration camp scenes - Spielberg doesn't linger on the violence or sanitize it, he just shows it exactly as it was. The one element in color in the whole picture (a girl's red dress, reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now) isn't a concession to the somewhat cheesy sentimentality that is occasionally present in Spielberg's filmography, but a tool to highlight the tragedy of it all. The sobriety of the direction is reflected in every other aspect of the picture, most notably John Williams' Oscar-winning score and the three main performances: Kingsley's talent was never in doubt after Gandhi, and Neeson and Fiennes will probably never do better than here (although both have managed to get pretty close, thankfully).This painfully real film is a precious means to remember the past and think thoroughly about one of the worst things that ever happened to people, an atrocity mankind hopefully won't repeat, not even in a thousand years. It's a look on the past that serves as a warning for the future, and as such, its power will never diminish.",10,9,13,7 December 2005
The Incredibles," The greatest adventure of 2004!
","The Incredibles is further proof Pixar focuses more on story and characters rather than in-jokes and celebrity voices, as in Dreamworks'features (not that there's anything wrong with that, just look at Shrek 1 AND 2). Okay, there are quite a lot of pop-culture references in this film, because of the story, but that doesn't stop The Incredibles from being an... incredible movie.For the first time in a Pixar film, the main characters are human: Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) used to be a great superhero, Mr.Incredible, until such activities became illegal (fans of Alan Moore may find that concept familiar). Now he has to deal with a boring job and his family: wife Helen (Holly Hunter), aka Elastigirl, and three kids, Dash (who's called Flash in the Italian version, guess why), Violet(who's got the same powers as Marvel's Invisible Woman) and baby Jack-Jack, who so far seems to be 'normal'. He's desperate to return to the old glorious days, not realizing his family is the 'greatest adventure ever'. And their help will be needed when a new threat shows up...The film's best element is the script, which teaches a valuable lesson (family matters more than anything) while providing some jaw-dropping action scenes (no wonder the movie got a PG rating) and various references to the genre (almost every existing superhero is poked at, as well as James Bond and Indiana Jones). The other awesome thing is of course the characters: the titular family is basically the 'super' version of the Simpsons (Bob getting home from work is pure Homer), and two supporting characters deserve a special mention. One is Frozone, Mr.Incredible's buddy, the only one in the movie who's voiced by a real star (Samuel L. Jackson, who's a gas as usual). The most important one, though, is Edna Mode, who makes the supers' outfits. Wonderful and hilarious, she's one of the best animated characters in years (ironically enough, she's voiced by a man, the movie's writer/director, Brad Bird).For those who really love movies, The Incredibles is a must-see in the animated feature category. Don't miss it!",10,5,8,8 December 2005
Amadeus," Riveting and visually stunning biopic.
","The first time I heard of this movie was in an episode of The Simpsons. In one scene, Marge tells her kids about Mozart's life, only to be criticized by Lisa for using Milos Forman's Amadeus as a source, since said film supposedly contains few true things. That may be the case, but as long as Amadeus remains one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen, why should I care?Amadeus is a beautiful film, which deservedly won the Best Picture and Director Oscars for 1984. Most of its genius is to be found in Milos Forman's ability not to be distracted by the vastness and splendor of the production design and the costumes and focus on the intriguing plot and well constructed characters.This is obvious already in the beginning, which is one of the best ever filmed. We see a priest enter an asylum to speak to Antonio Salieri (Academy Award-winner F. Murray Abraham), once a famous composer, now a disgraced and abandoned madman. When the two meet, Salieri starts playing the piano to test the priest's musical knowledge. After two failed attempts, he finally finds something the churchman recognizes, as the latter eagerly says: 'Oh, that's charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote it'. Salieri's answer? 'I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang... Amadeus... Mozart...'. And so the story begins, told in flashback by the Italian composer.Mozart himself doesn't actually appear until about 17 minutes into the film. In fact, the strings are constantly pulled by Salieri, who starts his narration by recalling his difficult childhood and his prayer to God that he be allowed to spread His will through music. Naturally, such a thing doesn't happen. That privilege is awarded to young Mozart (Tom Hulce), who's in Vienna to perform for the Emperor (Jeffrey Jones). Imagine Salieri's surprise when he discovers that such talent can be found in a kid. Imagine his total astonishment when he realizes the 'enfant prodige' from Salzburg is in reality a foul-mouthed, rude womanizer. The shock is too much for the envious Italian who, despite recognizing and admiring the perfection and superiority of the rival's work, vows to destroy him by any means necessary.The movie was shot almost entirely on location in Forman's home-town Prague, which perfectly captures the magic, but also the low points, of Mozart's life: from marvelous palaces and theaters to distasteful 'night-clubs', Amadeus is a visual roller-coaster, never letting the eye rest amidst the settings of many fascinating (and shocking) events, events that form a haunting tale of jealousy and bitterness, masterfully incarnated by Abraham, a very talented actor who has sadly been confined to supporting parts ever since (his best post-Amadeus work? The Inquisitor in The Name of the Rose). Shame, because he has all the right qualities to carry an entire film. Also unjustly forgotten after this movie is Tom Hulce, who succeeds in making the great Austrian musician look like an annoying, occasionally drunk, constantly laughing (oh, that laughter is terrible) brat.Few films, particularly biopics, manage to stay interesting for all their running time. Luckily Amadeus is such a film: at almost three hours, it's consistently captivating, inspired and inspiring.",10,1,2,31 July 2006
The Game," Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s
","Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have 'sold out' and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.In Fincher's third film, The Game, that solitude is physically incarnated by Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas), a wealthy businessman who is so obsessed with his job he has forgotten everything about the simple joys of life. The only person who still stays in touch with him is his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), who is Nicholas' polar opposite in terms of attitude. One night, when they're out to celebrate the elder brother's birthday, Conrad mentions a 'game' that changed his life and suggests Nicholas participate too, as it would be 'fun'. Though initially hesitant, the latter eventually gives in to curiosity and decides to give it a shot. Within a few hours, however, he will regret it: the 'game' is actually some sort of conspiracy involving everyone in town. With his assets frozen, his apartment no longer a safe place and no one left to trust, Nicholas must figure out how to solve the problem before it's too late - for him or someone else...As usual, Fincher makes sure the film works on a technical level, cleverly using camera angles, lighting (shades of red and brown being the dominant color) and editing to keep the suspense alive and the atmosphere conveniently murky. It is mainly this masterful handling of film-making tools that keeps the viewer from questioning the logic of the nonetheless brilliant screenplay, some of the twists giving the impression of a dystopic set-up rather than a plausible situation (and yet the script is supposedly based on a real event). Two other elements contribute to elevating The Game above the average mystery tale: a truly unpredictable, phenomenal ending, in pure Fincher tradition (well, at least until he made Panic Room), and the great work by the leading men, Douglas' paranoid desperation slyly erasing all hints of typecasting (after all, this is not the first time he has played someone who is being manipulated; in fact, one scene explicitly spoofs one of those previous movies) and Penn's smug anarchy anticipating director's masterpiece, Fight Club, and its central character, Tyler Durden (without a doubt Brad Pitt's best role to date).In short, those looking for a 'different' cinematic experience should give The Game a try: it might come off as overly cold or contrived at first, but like all of Fincher's movies it deserves a re-evaluation (Fight Club wasn't exactly a hit when originally released) and stands the test of time as one of the most original, smartest films of the '90s.",9,46,57,20 May 2007
The Illusionist," A fascinating period piece, with added value coming from Norton and Giamatti
","Given the proximity in release dates, it's hard not to start comparing Neil Burger's The Illusionist and Chris Nolan's The Prestige: after all, both are based on novels, deal with magic and have the same key theme (the contrast between illusion and reality); unlike The Prestige, however, The Illusionist is a more cerebral thriller-cum-romance, every single event having a reasonable explanation.At the center of these events we find the enigmatic Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a very talented magician who earns his living by entertaining early 20th century Vienna. Very little is known of his past, but then again that doesn't matter: what people really want to know is how he manages the impossible, like making an orange tree grow on stage or even, in the film's eeriest scenes, summon the dead. Particularly eager to prove everything has to be a trick is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), who is intrigued and at the same time scared by the reclusive illusionist. What starts as intellectual duel between the two becomes something more complex when Eisenheim meets the arrogant Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and realizes the latter's fiancée, Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), is his lost childhood love. Old sparks reignite, and all of a sudden the story moves in a more suspenseful direction, the magician being forced to come up with something extraordinary to save Sophie from the cruel prince before it's too late.And extraordinary things do indeed happen, as the director flawlessly uses everything he has (especially Dick Pope's Oscar-nominated cinematography and Philip Glass' stylish score) to provide the correct atmosphere of intrigue and mystery. In achieving this a major contribution also comes from the performances, Norton's elusive charm being the perfect counterbalance to Giamatti's cold rationalism. In fact, it is whenever the two are apart that the picture starts to feel a little lifeless: while Biel's work improves considerably in the second half of the film (a little bit ironic, actually: you will understand why once you have seen it), Sewell's one-dimensional pantomime is so annoying it becomes difficult not to wait for something bad to happen to him. Which brings me to the other weakness in an otherwise riveting piece of art: the ending. I mentioned earlier on that The Illusionist's climax provided a plausible explanation regarding every 'trick' seen in the film. Unfortunately, said explanation also comes and goes so fast (forgive the expression) it might irritate more than please.Overall, though, this is one of the most interesting movies to have come out recently. Just sit down, watch and let Eisenheim fool you. It should be a rewarding experience.",8,0,0,15 April 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better than the first one, but little else than simple summer entertainment
","Given the first Fantastic Four's box-office success (despite a storm of negative reviews), a sequel was almost mandatory. And with a trailer that promised lots of action and, most of all, the screen debut of fan-favorite Silver Surfer, one may be forgiven for expecting the second installment to be much better than its predecessor. The truth? 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is nowhere near the levels of Spider-Man, X-Men or even Hulk, but it does slightly improve on the original, the result being a passable, rather entertaining summer actioner.At first, though, it seems like we're slipping back into the first film's mediocrity: after a pretty good opening sequence (showing Galactus, here depicted differently than in the comics, as he destroys a planet), the movie cuts to Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm's (Jessica Alba) wedding arrangements, during which the FF's leader throws out some gibberish about their imminent union being more important than sub-molecular problems (huh?). His fiancée's reaction? 'That's the most romantic thing you have ever said to me!'.Thankfully, that dull moment is immediately forgotten, as we move on to the actual wedding ceremony (featuring one of Stan Lee's best cameos: he plays a rejected guest, in reference to a similar scene in the original comic-book issue), which is abruptly interrupted by a mysterious force that is causing climactic changes all around the world (cue an amusing joke about global warming). This force, it turns out, is actually the Surfer (physically portrayed by Doug Jones, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), a herald who looks for planets the aforementioned Galactus can feed on. His presence implies that the Four have got only one week to come up with a solution to Earth's problems, and on top of that they have to deal with the return of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), who was revived by the Surfer's actions.In terms of plotting, this film has a more interesting script than the first installment: having introduced the characters in the previous movie, Don Payne and Mark Frost can focus on defining them a little better (something that was missing last time) in order to properly integrate their different personalities into the story. Largely, they succeed: the best characters are still the Human Torch (Chris Evans, cocky, self-absorbed and funny) and the Thing (Michael Chiklis, ranging between amusing and eager to fight), but Reed and Sue get a better treatment as well, emerging as three-dimensional people instead of underwritten type. Gruffudd, in particular, is more comfortable in his role, as proved by a hilarious disco scene, one of the best examples of how the film manages to replicate the comic's mix of humor and light action (this is a PG feature after all).Speaking of which, another improvement concerns the action scenes: they may not match the visual inventiveness of other Marvel adaptations, but thanks to the Silver Surfer's presence they are charged with an energy that was unseen in the first movie (the Torch-Surfer duel is even better in the actual film than it was in the trailer). The Surfer himself is also a charismatic addition, although the short running time (92 minutes), combined with the fact that it takes half an hour before he shows up, makes the exploration of his tragic nature a little rushed. Of course, it doesn't help that a lot of time is spent, or rather wasted, on Dr. Doom: McMahon may look more menacing than before (especially at the beginning of the film), but once again he prefers to sideline his own lethal charm and mimic previous Marvel villains (the Green Goblin in the first movie, Magneto in the sequel), reducing a respected and feared character to a half-hearted pantomime; in addition, the bad-guy-becoming-ally gimmick has been used before and much better, namely by Bryan Singer in the superb X2. Another disappointment is Galactus: that he doesn't exactly look like his comic-book counterpart was to be expected; that he doesn't speak once and is used very sparely (little more than five minutes in the entire movie) considerably diminishes the impact of his presence, making the Surfer the only element able to save the film.Saving a motion picture, however, turns out to be a lot more difficult than saving the world, at least in this case, meaning that, though enjoyable, 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a fairly average summer movie. Which is all right compared to the original FF movie, but not considering the higher quality of other blockbusters out there.",7,2,4,20 August 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The curious career of David Fincher...
","'He must be selling out' lots of people thought upon hearing David Fincher, one of cinema's great masters of darkness (he directed Se7en and all that), had accepted to direct a Forrest Gump-like epic love story, based on the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, that had been considered by Ron Howard and - wait for it - Steven Spielberg. Surely he must be out of his mind? Of course not. After all, he was accused of repeating himself when word hit the streets he was making Zodiac, and that turned out to be a completely different opus.Using Hurricane Katrina as a framing device (typical Fincher boldness), the film opens in a New Orleans hospital where an old woman named Daisy is spending her final moments with her daughter (Julia Ormond). At her mother's request, the latter agrees to read a journal written by Daisy's great love, while the hospital staff around them is busy organizing evacuations. The journal begins like this: 'My name is Benjamin Button, and I was born under unusual circumstances...'.The story shifts to 1918: the first World War is over, and a blind clockmaker (Elias Koteas) celebrates by building a clock that goes backwards, saying it embodies his wish of things going differently. The man disappears and is never heard from again, and in another part of town Mr. Button (Jason Flemyng) is shocked when he loses his wife in childbirth and the baby is revealed to be horribly deformed. He abandons the child outside a retirement home, a most fitting choice since medical examination reveals the little boy was born with all the characteristics of an 80-year old man. Years pass, and Benjamin (Brad Pitt), as he's called by his adoptive mother (Taraji P. Henson) discovers he isn't very normal: while everyone else around him has a tendency to die of old age, he gets younger. As time goes by, he travels around the world and keeps running into Daisy (Cate Blanchett), who was his 'childhood' sweetheart. Their relationship is inevitably complicated because of Benjamin's reversed aging, and as his life reaches its paradoxical epilogue he comes to realize that nothing ever lasts.Yes, the line about things never lasting does remind of Forrest Gump's speech about chocolate, and given Eric Roth wrote both movies and Pitt's Southern accent is reminiscent of Tom Hanks' Gump tunes (especially during the narration), it's far too easy to label The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as just another shameless Oscar bait (that Zemeckis triumphed over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction is still a sour memory). But there's a lot more to the film's credit than meets the eye: firstly, the story is a much more epic deal, with additional kudos coming from the literary source, and a smart, thoughtful reflection on mortality and doomed love (so there is some darkness, after all); secondly, Benjamin is a more complex and intriguing character than Forrest, and Brad Pitt's understated performance enriches him even more (and Blanchett is, as always, extraordinary).Furthermore, the film allows Fincher to explore one of his favorite themes, featured prominently in Fight Club: film as a medium, an artificial product. Not only does he enjoy recreating pieces of cinema at its earliest stages (the flashbacks from circa 1900 are shot as if those scenes had been filmed in that very period) and toying with the on-screen notion of time (the backwards war sequence, which plays out as a reversal of the most technically impressive part of Zodiac); there's even a hint of deliberate irony in the casting of Elle Fanning (Pitt and Blanchett's daughter in Babel) as Daisy aged seven (and that's without mentioning Pitt's opportunity to relive his Thelma and Louise years, thanks to a remarkable mix of make-up and CGI).So yes, it's the kind of film the Academy tends to notice, but that might just be their way of apologizing for overlooking Fight Club (and Zodiac). And yes, there's a love story, but one that goes hand in hand with a not-so-cheerful theme like death. And yes, it may be the director's most mainstream project to date (complete with PG-13 rating), but rumor has it he argued with Warner Bros. over the running time (166 minutes) and fought to keep his vision intact. Now, who said he is selling out? 9,5/10",10,1,2,8 February 2009
Transformers," Very slick and fun, but could easily have been twenty minutes shorter
","'It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset'. This is what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Transformers, Michael Bay's summer blockbuster based on an '80s cartoon series, stating that after a succession of mediocre films (Pearl Harbor being the climax) Jerry Bruckheimer's former protégé finally got it right with an action film that works because it doesn't take itself seriously. That's exactly how the movie should be approached: the minute someone starts questioning the script's plausibility instead of praising the great humor, there's nothing left to do.That the concept is, in Ebert's words, 'preposterous', is evident from the very beginning: a group of American soldiers stationed in Quatar are suddenly attacked by an unidentified, lethal machine, and a few hours later several top secret files are stolen from the Air Force One's mainframe, prompting the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) to summon the best signal analysts in the country in order to understand what they are dealing with. Unfortunately, the enemy is neither Chinese nor Russian: the bad guys are Decepticons, alien robots who are able to transform into normal vehicles and therefore 'live' among us unseen (their home-planet, Cybertron, was destroyed during a war). These droids have a double mission: firstly, they must find their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), who disappeared while looking for the Allstar, a mysterious, powerful cube; secondly, they have to retrieve that cube, which will enable them to turn every machine on Earth into a weapon and conquer our planet with no difficulty at all. They are, however, not the only ones seeking the Cube: the Autobots, another Cybertron race led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who also played the role in the cartoon show), are after the Allstar as well, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenager whose grandfather somehow figured out the mysterious object's location, is on their side.The director originally turned down the film, calling it a 'stupid toy movie', only to realize he had said the same thing regarding Raiders of the Lost Ark over twenty years ago and subsequently change his mind. And even though Bay is no Steven Spielberg (who coincidentally is the executive producer of this movie) and LaBeouf, as likable as he gets, is no Harrison Ford, Transformers is a genuinely enjoyable ride. Why? Because Bay, having realized some stories cannot be handled seriously (which is the mistake he made on his previous works), delivers his latest blockbuster exactly as it is meant to be: very loud, dumb, unpretentious and, most of all, funny. Rather than playing it straight, he focuses on the comedy that emerges from the film's far-fetched scenario: Sam's laughable yet realistic attempts to seduce his friend Mikaela (Megan Fox), his reaction to the discovery that his new car is actually an Autobot, a hilarious conversation with his parents concerning what he was doing alone in his room with the door locked (unmissable). Not all the laughs come from the leading man, mind: the supporting players contribute a lot to make the movie one of the most ridiculously entertaining of the year, particularly John Turturro as the uptight, idiotic Agent Simmons ('You gonna lay the fate of the world on a kid's Camaro?').Sadly, all this fun can't distract from the movie's main flaw: the running time. At 144 minutes, it is way too long for a flick like this, and some of the action scenes (especially the final showdown, which goes on and on for what seems like an eternity) could have been shortened, leaving the movie with an acceptable duration (let's say two hours) and more time spent on the human side of the story rather than the CGI.Still, Tranformers is probably the year's smartest dumb movie. Plus, any film that's cheeky enough to make fun of its director ('This is so much better than Armageddon!' a character says halfway through the picture) deserves a look.",8,3,8,5 July 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Scandinavian thrills
","It is a quite uncommon event, that a Swedish film should get so much attention pretty much anywhere, not just in Scandinavia or, outside its home regions, the art-house circuit (Bergman isn't exactly multiplex stuff). Of course, when the film in question is based on a best-selling novel, nay, the most profitable book in Northern Europe, it's a whole different thing: partly because of the unique circumstances surrounding its inception (the author was a journalist who wrote fiction just for fun and died shortly after submitting the final version of the manuscripts), Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy has shocked and enthralled readers all over the world, which explains why the adaptation of the first chapter, Men Who Hate Women (retitled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English-speaking countries), has become the most successful Swedish movie of all time. That, and the fact that it's a very good film.Not surprisingly, the main character is, like the late author, an investigative reporter, a man in his late forties named Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Sentenced to a six-month stint in prison for allegedly forging evidence against a powerful businessman he wrote about in the magazine Millennium (hence the trilogy's title), he still has the time to carry out an assignment handed to him by one Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube): to find out what happened on the day Vanger's niece, Harriet, disappeared. Dis she simply vanish, or was she murdered? As the plot thickens, Mikael receives unexpected help from Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a young hacker with a troubled past and continued problems with her legal status, more specifically her sleazy guardian.In the transition from page to screen, some elements had to be abandoned, obviously: gone are the data on abused women that opened each section of the book (the major contribution of Larsson's journalistic side), as well as the sly references to past detective story staples (Blomkvist and Vanger mention Agatha Christie when discussing their investigation). In terms of plot, on the other hand, the adaptation process is worthy of L.A. Confidential: no unnecessary subplots (do we really need to see Mikael sleeping with half the women he encounters?) or irrelevant side characters, just Blomkvist and Salander, an odd investigative couple whose essence is best summed up by Mikael's line: 'You know everything about me, and I don't know sh*t about you.'. It's that kind of weird humor, spoken in plain, brutal Swedish, that gives the film its heart, along with a decent dose of mystery.The Scandinavian landscape has its part in guaranteeing the story's success, too: like in the wonderful Let the Right One In, the cold, snowy environment provides the ideal backdrop for one of the most chilling (pun not intended) and grisly tales of murder ever committed to film. Staying true to the book's bleak core, the violence is depicted without many restrictions, especially in the central rape scene that justifies the original Swedish title and sets The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo aside from the majority of Hollywood's sanitized thrillers.In short, this is a riveting, rewarding experience. Needless to say, an American version is already in the works to please subtitle-weary moviegoers. It's not necessarily a bad idea (look at what Chris Nolan did with Insomnia, originally a Norwegian picture), but can there really be a Tinseltown actress brave - and good - enough to take over from the mesmerizing Noomi Rapace? Well, at least she still has two more films to steal before that happens...8,5/10",9,22,32,20 March 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Truth,justice and the American way...
","In the '50s, paranoid US senator Joseph McCarthy led a witch hunt against all people suspected of being communists, ruining a lot of lives (Academy Award-winning screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was among his victims). This compelling and honest movie is about the one man who tried to take down the senator, a journalist who eventually started a chain of events leading to the end of McCarthy's terror.That man's name was Edward Murrow (the film's title comes from his trademark sign-off at the end of each broadcast), and like fellow journalists Woodward and Bernstein (see All the President's Men) he looked for the truth, knowing about the consequences and facing his enemy fearlessly. He was the kind of anchorman we really need nowadays, and thanks to George Clooney's second directorial effort, he'll never be forgotten.In the movie, McCarthy is shown through archive footage, making it more realistic (besides, there's no need for an actor to embody his buffoon-like personality), as we see Murrow ( David Strathairn) and his colleagues (including Clooney himself, who's also written the script, and Robert Downey Jr.) reveal the truth about all the people who are dragged in court because suspected of supporting communists or being communists themselves. Even Murrow is accused of being anti-American, but he doesn't care and goes on with his battle.With this very personal opus (his father Nick was an anchorman and a huge admirer of Murrow's tenacity) George Clooney shows us that journalism, just like in the already mentioned All the President's Men, is an instrument that should be used only to tell the truth, and he gets great help from the excellent Strathairn, best known for smaller parts in modern classics (he was Tom Cruise's brother in The Firm and Kim Basinger's pimp in L.A. Confidential). The supporting cast impresses as well (other than Clooney and Downey, there are also memorable turns from Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels and Patricia Clarkson), but it's Strathairn's slender figure and calm voice that dominate the entire picture.Justly awarded for Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival and a very likely Oscar contender next year, This is a real masterpiece, one of the must-see films of 2005. If you're looking for a powerful, moving, flawless anti-blockbuster, then look no further:Good Night, and Good Luck",10,16,38,24 September 2005
Shrek 2," Fairy tales Episode II : Return of the Ogre
","Remember Shrek, the ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) whose hilarious adventures were told in the eponymous animated film from 2001, a quite adult, politically incorrect cartoon? Well, he's back and he's more incorrect than ever! In the previous movie, we left our hero living happily ever after with his 'beautiful' wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Now, the issues begin, as the couple has to go to the kingdom of Far Far Away so Shrek can meet the in-laws (John Cleese and Julie Andrews). Sound familiar? Yeah, you've probably seen the same story in other movies, but it still makes people laugh for hours. Anyway, there's also another problem: the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), who would rather see Fiona alongside her son, the narcissistic (and perhaps a bit gay) Prince Charming (Rupert Everett)...This sequel is much better than the original, with an intriguing story, ace gags (mostly involving Disney features) and tons of movie references (including Alien, Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings and Mission:Impossible). But let's not forget the characters: like in the first film, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) steals the show, constantly talking and talking and talking (Shrek:'Donkey, you HAVE the right to remain silent! What you lack is the capacity!'). But there's a new entry that basically overshadows him: Puss In Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas (who deliberately spoofs his old character Zorro). Cute but lethal, he's practically the best thing in the movie.Smart, funny and moving, this is a sequel both kids and (most of all) adults will enjoy over and over again...",9,0,0,7 December 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," QT's gor(e)geous return!
","Six years after Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino tackles a new genre, one that has been exploited hundreds of times in all the B-movies he so deeply loves: the revenge flick. And in terms of style, Kill Bill: Vol.1 has a kind of 'B' look: very little is told about The Bride (Uma Thurman) and her motivations. All we know is she was an ex killer, who was brutally attacked on her wedding day and shot in the head by former boss (and lover) Bill (David Carradine). After a four-year coma, all she wants is bloody revenge. And bloody it shall be...Actually, a lot of people complained about the excessive violence in this film (a Finnish critic, whose opinion I don't share, compared Vol.1 and Sin City by defining both movies 'a pointless violence choreography'). Come on, how can anyone take those scenes seriously? They are beautiful, but SO surreal: you lose a finger, and half the blood in your entire body bursts out like it was a volcano erupting! That's the brilliance of Tarantino's work: the movie is 5% talking, 95% killing, but the gore is so unnatural you can't help laughing at it and just enjoy the whole thing.As I said before, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is more style than content: those who expect the usual pop culture-related dialogue will be more satisfied when they see Vol.2, as will the people who want more insight on the characters. There is though one person we get to know more about: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the number #1 on The Bride's death list. But in the end the best scene with her happens to be completely silent: her slow motion entrance in the House of Blue Leaves. It's an excellent sequence, brilliantly scored by Rza (the first time QT uses original music).Oh, I almost forgot: there is one thing left from Tarantino's earlier films: impeccable acting. Vivica Fox, Sonny Chiba, Daryl Hannah and the aforementioned Liu and Carradine (who doesn't show up that much, actually) are great, but the film really is a one-man show, or rather one-woman: Uma Thurman was, to put it mildly, BORN to play the lead in this movie. She's so mesmerizing, no wonder QT calls her his 'muse'.An almost perfect film, with only one defect: the last line spoken by Bill, which spoils the second part's main surprise. Apart from that, it's hell of a movie!9,5/10",10,2,5,10 January 2006
Saw II," Let's play some more
","The first Saw was, on its own terms, groundbreaking in its nastiness and brutal originality. The sequel, on the other hand, does what all other horror follow-ups do - mimic the formula of the first one -, albeit with a little more thoughtfulness.The script, according to various statements by the crew, was originally a stand-alone thriller, written by director Darren Lynn Bousmann, and had to be rearranged to fit in the Saw universe after the original became a huge box office hit. Despite Leigh Whannell's best efforts, this fact shows quite a bit, mostly because of the plot being a lot more complex than in the first movie. This time, instead of two people in a bathroom, we have eight in an entire building, and it's only a matter of hours before they're all killed by lethal nerve gas. While each of them figures out why he or she deserves to be there, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his task force get as far as facing Jigsaw himself (Tobin Bell), a cancer-ridden old man who has no intention of dying before his work is complete. There is also another reason why Matthews can't kill him right away: his only son is the gas-infested building.Making the story more twisted and ambitious is not a bad thing per se, but considering all the traps seen in the first Saw were conceived for one or two people at most, the mass carnage in Saw II appears a little difficult to justify. That it becomes rather easy to ignore this fact is down to two elements: the consistent tension, paired with some good old gore, and Tobin Bell, who is allowed to expand on his character after the brilliant twist ending of the previous entry showed us how far he could go. Having perfected his villainous acting in episodes of Alias and 24 (and also, surprisingly, Seinfeld), he owns the entire film, spitting out Jigsaw's life (and death) philosophy with understated menace.And then there's the one thing most fans will judge more harshly than anything else: the final twist, or rather twists (there are at least two). One is a bit of a let-down, in fact it's Saw II's biggest liability (anyone who's seen the first movie can guess it very easily), the other is actually smarter than expected, although the overall feeling is that the ending was constructed to leave the road open for Saw III instead of providing a good shock. Still, after seeing the third installment, it has to be said that at least the makers of the second one tried their best.",6,0,0,3 November 2008
Clash of the Titans," Dumb fun, but not enough
","On paper, Clash of the Titans was a good idea for a remake, since the original, while fondly remembered, hardly qualifies as a classic, with its uneven acting (notably male lead Harry Hamlin) and dated - though still quite impressive - visual effects. Throw in a director who knows how to do action (Louis Leterrier), some classy supporting actors for the divine parts (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, last seen together in a totally different film, Schindler's List), and the new superstar of the decade (Sam Worthington), and you've got all the right ingredients for a fun romp. Unfortunately, the new version, while good in parts, fails to deliver as an overall viewing experience.Surprisingly enough for a remake, the script sticks quite close to the original: Perseus (Worthington), a demigod, has to face numerous perils in order to save princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) and prevent an all-out war between gods and men. What's new is a more epic approach to the story, with a focus on the rivalry between Zeus (Neeson) and Hades (Fiennes), and a bizarre 'romantic' twist, with the mysterious Io (Gemma Arterton) replacing Perseus' elderly mentor (Burgess Meredith) from the first film.In theory, there would be no need to bicker about the plot: Clash of the Titans is meant to be nothing more than sheer, dumb fun, and anyone with a true passion for Greek mythology might want to look away from blatant alterations to the myths (see the whole story about Perseus' birth) and borrowings from other cultures (the Djinn and, of course, the Kraken, recently brought back by the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise). However, whereas Desmond Davis' 1981 take on the story truly opted for sheer fun, the 2010 update stumbles into a few logical pratfalls (Zeus' behavior is a bit schizophrenic in the last act), chunks of appalling 'contemporary' dialogue (the protagonist's warning about Medusa: 'Don't look this b*tch in the eye!'), a pointless cameo by the infamous mechanical owl Bubo and a plain ridiculous epilogue that - rumor has it - was added at the last minute to leave the road open for potential sequels (what a surprise...).Another major problem is the 'big' new contribution: 3D. Having seen both versions, it is safe to say the three-dimensional Clash is a rather unappealing sight. This is because, unlike Avatar or Coraline, which were conceived and filmed in 3D from the start, and made an intelligent use of the technology, Clash of the Titans was shot in 2D and subsequently 'converted' to the new format in the wake of Avatar's huge business (the fact that Worthington stars in both pictures may also have been a factor). The result is a movie whose action scenes, which are edited very quickly, become unintelligible in 3D, which takes most of the fun out of it (also, slow motion looks awful with the added dimension). With the exception of a couple of scenes, namely those that were fixed in post-production to begin with, the experience is a pretty negative one.However, there are still a few things to enjoy: with the 3D out of the equation, Leterrier deserves credit for nailing all the huge sequences - Scorpioks, Medusa, Kraken - with a subtle use of CGI that sort of pays tribute to Ray Harryhausen's original work. Additionally, the cast does a more than passable job, although the wide array of accents on display (Australian for Perseus, Irish for Zeus, unspecified for Draco and English for everyone else) is a bit baffling at times. As expected, Neeson and Fiennes are the best of the bunch, with the kind of gravitas only British actors seem to possess in this kind of production, while Worthington delivers a committed but not entirely charismatic performance, occasionally coming off as a bad Russell Crowe clone. It is also worth wondering why the filmmakers bothered to cast relatively famous actors for throwaway parts: Danny Huston (Poseidon) and Polly Walker (in a role reminiscent of her Rome character) are wasted, while Alexander Siddig's appearance is so brief even die-hard Star Trek fans could have trouble spotting him (that's what happened to me, anyway).Overall, the new, 'improved' Clash of the Titans provides some excitement but generally disappoints, compared to other blockbusters of recent memory. Best stick with the original: it may have aged a bit, but the fun factor remains unaltered.",6,1,1,18 May 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Depp & Burton forever!
","Don't mind about the trailer,which is quite ridiculous indeed:this is Tim Burton's best movie since Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns.Roald Dahl's unforgettable novel is faithfully brought to the screen,as we see poor boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore,much more cheerful than in Finding Neverland)winning a trip inside the local chocolate factory. And it is an AMAZING factory:almost entirely built from scratch,with limited use of CG,it's a pure and simple visual joy,reminiscent of when the director gave cinematic life to Gotham City. Along with Charlie there are four other kids,perfectly played by the young actors.The only problem is the obnoxious, TV-obsessed Mike Teavee (fitting surname, huh?),who's even more boring than in the book,the only character you really hope will get in trouble. The Oompa Loompas,all played by the same actor,Deep Roy, are very enjoyable,even in the musical numbers,not really necessary ,but charming (they're voiced by Danny Elfman,whose score is terrific as usual).This really is a Tim Burton movie,and you notice that from the beginning:the snow falling down and even covering the Warner Bros.logo,the camera moving inside the factory,which reminds of the opening sequences of Batman and Edward Scissorhands,the thrilling music... He's even made it more personal by adding an interesting back-story involving Willy Wonka and his father(a welcome return to creepy characters for Christoher Lee). Which brings us to the real reason you watch this movie,the amazing chocolatier...Johnny Depp! He's not acting, he IS Willy Wonka,and he's obviously enjoying himself,portraying someone who's twice as mad as Jack Sparrow,sorry,I mean,Captain Jack Sparrow.Depp and Burton working together is always a guarantee of quality,and this fourth collaboration of theirs is a perfect return to the weird,slightly Gothic movies that made us love them,after their recent,and rather good by the way,mainstream efforts(Big Fish and Pirates of the Caribbean). Don't get me wrong,children can watch,and love,this film,but it really is something everyone should enjoy,no matter how old they are(actually,when I saw the movie,there were only 4 or 5 kids,and 20 adults).I haven't seen the original movie with Gene Wilder,but thanks to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp,this version is already a classic. I'm really looking forward to seeing Corpse Bride and any other movie they might make together.Batman Begins aside,this is the best film of summer 2005.",9,5,9,15 August 2005
Mission: Impossible II," Awesome action scenes, lame script.
","The opening credits sequence is excellent: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climbs a mountain with his bare hands; once he reaches the peak, a chopper shows up, shooting a missile on the ground. This missile contain a pair of sunglasses, thanks to which Hunt receives instructions concerning his new assignment, followed by the famous line 'This message will self-destruct in five seconds'. He then tosses the glasses away, their explosion forming the movie's title. That scene, alongside the spectacular motorbike chase, is M:I:II's highlight. Otherwise it's just an ordinary, predictable and pretty stupid action flick.This time, Hunt and his partner, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have to stop their former colleague Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from infecting the world with a deadly virus known as 'Chimera'. In order to succeed, they need help from Nayah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's ex, who's now dating Ethan. You can easily guess the rest...Like his predecessor, Brian De Palma, action guru John Woo favors style over substance. But De Palma had a good script to work on. Woo, on the other hand, hopes the audience won't notice the narrative flaws, so that he can offer us his visual trademarks (slow motion, doves etc.). Unfortunately for him, we do notice the flaws: for one thing, the love story is quite insipid, and it's also given too much room (no prize for guessing how the film ends: it's SO obvious!). In addition, the characters stink: Nayah is still passable, but new sidekick Billy Baird (John Polson) was completely unnecessary. Why not just leave Luther alone? And Ambrose is a crappy villain: in Scott's hands, he looks like a stereotyped caricature of a respectable bad guy. Still, Cruise and Rhames make a great spy couple, and Anthony Hopkins'uncredited cameo as Hunt's supervisor is very enjoyable, particularly his infamous remark: 'Mr. Hunt, this isn't mission:difficult, this is mission:impossible. 'Difficult' should be a walk in the park for you.' Pity the same can't be said of this film's director.",6,0,0,7 May 2006
World Trade Center," Far from perfect, but still very moving
","When I first heard Oliver Stone was going to make this film, I was surprised: the world's most political director, not to mention Hollywood's number one troublemaker, tackling such a delicate subject, still painfully echoing in collective memory? What would the movie be like? What theories would it expose? Who was going to be blamed this time?When I eventually saw World Trade Center, I was happy to see Stone came up with the wisest decision regarding the film: for the first time in his career, he has made a picture that doesn't accuse anyone of anything (we don't even see the hijacked planes, just the shadow of one of them), but celebrates courage and kindness. Instead of building up a JFK-like investigation on who was behind the events of 9/11, he focuses on the true story of two average citizens who were caught in the middle of the chaos.The men in question are John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), two Port Authority officers who were sent to evacuate the Twin Towers and ended up being stuck between concrete ruins for hours waiting for someone to get them out. In telling this story, Stone divides the film in three sections: one detailing the protagonists'claustrophobic experience, another showing the nightmare their wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) go through, and the third about a Marine who decides to go to New York and provide some help.World Trade Center is very unusual by his standards (except for the violence, which I think is a bit too strong for a PG-13), but Stone manages to deliver a good film without using his trademark conspiracy subplots: all he wants is to show us how a group of ordinary people didn't give up and just kept hoping for the best. The scenes with McLoughlin and Jimeno are the most effective, filled with consistent tension and superbly acted. Cage, in particular, relying solely on his voice and face, gives a stunning performance that should be considered for an Oscar.There are, however, a few moments where the movie moves from great to ridiculous: some people have questioned the director's decision to over-dramatize the scene where the building between the Towers falls over Cage and Pena by playing it in slow motion, but that's quite forgivable in my opinion. What isn't, on the other hand, is the utterly risible 'Jesus vision' bit and the redundant, pretentious flashbacks showcasing the two officers'private lives. The film also gets frustratingly rhetorical with the closing voice-over, emphasizing how brave those men were on that particular day and all the rest: it's practically a summation of the entire movie, in case someone failed to understand what Stone's latest opus was about.Nonetheless, most of the time WTC proves to be a riveting film. Not an essential Stone film, but quite better than the half-cooked Alexander.",8,1,4,15 October 2006
Big Fish," Burton's most touching movie
","After the quite disappointing Planet of the Apes remake, Tim Burton returned to form with Big Fish, a strongly underrated gem which is one of the best pictures of 2003, along with The Return of the King, Lost in Translation and Mystic River. It's the most heartbreaking, poetic and romantic movie he's made since Edward Scissorhands, and it's a shame it didn't get the recognition it deserved.At the movie's center is the relationship between the dying Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, excellent) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) who wants to find out the truth about his dad: for several years, Edward has told some amazing stories concerning his life, and Will is the only one who has stopped believing them. Now, he wants to know what really happened.That's when the film properly kicks off, as we're shown young Edward's (Ewan Mcgregor, absolutely comfortable in the role) life exactly as he has described it, alternating facts and, for most of the story, fiction. Expect giants, witches, werewolves, a hidden town (appropriately called Spectre), a Fellini-inspired circus, fish which look like naked women and lots more. This is Burton as we like him: bizarre, unpredictable, hard to summarize. You have to see the movie to truly understand why people love it.Still, behind the adventurous and romantic facades lies great human tragedy. Big Fish will make you laugh, but by the time the end credits start rolling you will most probably have tears in your face. Life can be funny for a second, and very sad right after wards. Never has a Burton film been so dramatic.As I said, this is a wonderful film, yet sadly it was heavily overlooked (it received only one Oscar nom, for Danny Elfman's gripping score). Watching it is a marvelous experience.One scene is worth the entire viewing: Edward sees his future wife for the first time. According to some people, time stops in that moment. Burton makes it happen on screen. That one sequence is pure movie magic.",10,5,7,14 February 2006
The Dark Knight," Absolutely stunning!
","In 2005, Christopher Nolan reinvented the superhero movie with Batman Begins - not a bad thing, given Spider-Man 2 had practically achieved the same goal the year before. Now, history repeats itself with The Dark Knight: technically, it's the sixth Batman movie (or seventh, if you count the 1966 TV show tie-in), but it leaves you feeling like the previous entries never existed. Yes, even Begins.The first chapter of Nolan's Bats reboot ended suggesting the sequel would revolve around a certain clownish criminal who sees everything as a big joke and signs his horrific deeds with an instantly recognizable 'calling card', and indeed it does: five minutes into The Dark Knight, and after a bank job that looks more like Michael Mann than Chris Nolan, we are face to face with the Joker (the late, astounding Heath Ledger), who greets us with one of his trademark outbursts of twisted logic: 'I believe that what doesn't kill you simply makes you... stranger.'. Unlike any other foe Batman (Christian Bale) has ever faced, he isn't in it for the money, like Gotham's current mob boss Salvatore Maroni (Eric Roberts), or anything else: he just wants to spread chaos and anarchy, killing good guys and bad guys in equal measure. In order to stop him, Batman and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) seek the help of the city's new District Attorney, the charismatic Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), who also happens to be dating Bruce Wayne's former squeeze Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who does a more convincing job than Katie Holmes).Of course, things aren't easy. As Dent points out: 'You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain'. That's a phrase whose full meaning is revealed to terrible effect during the film, as the Joker's insane antics push Batman into the one direction he swore to stay away from: killing. The Dark Knight is as much a morality tale as it is a summer blockbuster: the title indicates a bleaker atmosphere will permeate the picture, and that's exactly what happens - even Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who provided the comic relief in the first movie, have a different function now that Gotham's fate looks worse than ever, courtesy of a make-up-wearing, constantly laughing maniac.In many ways, the movie belongs to the Joker, just like Tim Burton's version did in 1989. Ledger's take on the character, however, is completely different from Jack Nicholson's dandy interpretation, which became a successful blueprint for subsequent celluloid villains lifted from comics. The 21st century Joker is a pure psychopath, not a buffoon. His pranks aren't amusing, they're terrifying and very often lethal. He's a masochistic, fearless nihilist, played with tons of courage by a Ledger at the top of his game, a fact that makes his premature death (and the dedication in the end credits) even more unbearable than it already is. Talks of a posthumous Oscar are fully justified, since this is the culmination of his career, although the Academy has the annoying tendency to ignore acting in films like this (see Alec Guinness in Star Wars or Ian McKellen in The Fellowship of the Ring). Still, some sort of honorary recognition would be more than appropriate, since he has taken the essence of a comic-book character and made him so much more, a symbol of true evil that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the equally iconic - and scary - Alex DeLarge, Hannibal Lecter and Keyser Soze.But then again, is this film really all about the villain? No. At its core, The Dark Knight remains a movie about Batman himself, a man burdened with guilt and destined to loneliness. In fact, while the previous entry in the franchise focused largely on how he became the crime-fighter he is today, not one minute of this installment deals with the Joker's origins: when we first meet him he's already the most feared criminal in Gotham, and the few references to his past that come out of his mouth reflect his celebrated line from Alan Moore's graphic novel The Killing Joke: 'Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes the other. If I'm going to have a past, i prefer it to be multiple choice!'.The Killing Joke also inspires the film's biggest theme: the similarities between Batman and his nemesis. This isn't exactly a new element in Nolan's filmography: from Leonard and Teddy in Memento to Angier and Borden in The Prestige, he's always been concerned with the complex relationship that shapes up between two enemies. This time he offers his most radical take on the subject, with an interrogation scene that goes hand in hand with the coffee shop sequence in Michael Mann's Heat (another important influence, by the director's admission): 'I don't wanna kill you!' the Joker tells the Caped Crusader. 'What would I do without you? [...] You... complete me. [...] To them, you're just a freak. Like me!'. The comics have consistently suggested the Dark Knight and his most famous nemesis are really just two sides of the same coin. Nolan brings that theory to the screen with a visual and narrative boldness previously unheard of in the superhero genre, with a possibly even more disturbing variation on the theme coming in the shape of Aaron Eckhart's unsettling performance (the less said about it, the better: it has to be seen to be believed).Moral ambiguity, madness, bravery, betrayal, vengeance, responsibility, all in one movie. Shakespeare? No, just a damn smart, daring genre picture that goes beyond its paper roots and transforms into a cinematic tragedy of rare power and beauty. It will take something special to top this epic achievement.",10,4,8,25 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Still a great deal of fun, but less captivating than previous installments
","With each new film, the Harry Potter franchise gets darker and more mature, perhaps also to reflect the fact that the audience has grown up along with the characters. 'Darker', however, is not synonymous with 'better', in fact Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the least accomplished entry in the series so far.And yet it starts very promisingly: following a quarrel with his cousin Dudley, now a cruel bully, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is attacked by Dementors and thus forced to use magic in front of Muggles (i.e. human beings). Now, had this happened in one of the preceding movies, he would have gotten away with a mere warning, if even that. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Ministry of Magic has become incredibly paranoid when it comes to Harry: not only are they threatening to have him expelled from Hogwarts, they have also openly stated that the return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), which the teen wizard witnessed at the end of Goblet of Fire, is a scandalous lie invented with the purpose of spreading panic and allowing Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to take over the Ministry. Given the situation, all that is left to do is prepare for the imminent, inevitable battle in secret, which is why Dumbledore has restored the Order of the Phoenix, whose most prominent members include Harry's godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Sadly, they can't do much to solve Harry's other problem: Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a Ministry employee who has managed to be appointed as the new teacher of Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Her intentions? To keep all students disciplined, make sure no one mentions the Dark Lord and, generally, turn all the good people's lives into Hell.Regarding the tone, which is closer to (moderate) horror than fantasy (hence the PG-13 rating that has been applied since the fourth film), some critics have expressed their disappointment, fearing the last two movies, yet to be filmed, might become too violent for the franchise's target audience. And while it is true that an R-rated seventh episode would lose many of its viewers, it is equally true that the bleak moments are the best in the whole film: the last half-hour is arguably the strongest conclusion a Potter film's had to date, emotionally speaking, whereas everything that comes before that, especially the lighter stuff, is quite uneven.The problem has almost nothing to do with the adaptation, in fact director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to make an accessible, entertaining blockbuster out of an 800-page book which, according to many, is the weakest in the saga. Nearly all the unnecessary stuff that could have been amusing but wasn't very relevant in terms of plotting (such as possible returns for Kenneth Branagh and Miranda Richardson's characters) has been left out, ensuring the film hardly ever gets slowed down by futile digressions. There are, nonetheless, a few instances that are included in the movie but could easily have been left on the cutting room floor. What, for example, is the point of having Sirius' house elf Kreecher appear, when his contribution to the film's events equals zero (although he had an important role in the novel)? The same goes for Remus Lupin: it is nice to have David Thewlis back on board, but with very little of relevance to do or say the overall feeling is that his presence is merely a reminder of how great the third flick was (Brendan Gleeson, on the other hand, is allowed more space to reprise his quirky role from the previous installment). And last, but not least, the much talked-about kiss between Harry and Cho Chang (Katie Leung), which is part of the 'teen romance' section introduced in the fourth picture, is actually a huge disappointment because: a) there is no more mention of the love story in the rest of the picture; b) the scene itself, being completely flat and lifeless (and what we see is supposedly the best of the several takes that were required), stands out as the single dullest moment in the franchise's history, making it even more ironic that the subsequent sequence, a conversation between Harry and Ron that follows the book word for word ('How was it?' 'Wet!'), is one of the series' comic highlights.Elsewhere, though, the film seems to work pretty well, mainly thanks to the consistently reliable cast: Radcliffe is at his best, angry and in pain, while Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, sidelined in the fourth film, are enabled to steal the show once again, the former warm and humane, the latter deliciously sinister. As for the bad guys, Fiennes' role is, as usual, brief but instantly memorable, and the same ought to be said of Jason Isaacs, finally allowed to fully show his dark side. Now, what about Staunton? Well, she is far from bad as an actress, but her characterization makes Umbridge more of an annoying buffoon rather than an unsettling threat, making it possible for fellow 'bad girl' Helena Bonham Carter, who is truly disturbing and scary as the demented Bellatrix Lestrange, to outshine her.In the end, Order of the Phoenix is pretty good on its own, but sub-par compared to previous achievements. Hopefully Yates, who will direct the sixth film as well, will deliver a more even product next time.6,5/10",7,1,3,16 July 2007
Into the Wild," Exceptional in every possible way
","Sean Penn's Into the Wild is beautiful, staggering, thoughtful, a labor of love made by a filmmaker with real passion for the story he set out to tell. Like a Terrence Malick picture, Into the Wild transcends any conception such as 'if you only see one film this year' and goes beyond the very notion of 'Oscar-worthy'. If one really has to say something on the subject, then Into the Wild should have shared the Best Picture award with No Country for Old Men, but that kind of thinking is besides the point because Penn's masterpiece is more than a movie, or a work of art for that matter: it's a life experience.A rebel at heart, Penn clearly identifies, at least on a few levels, with the film's unconventional protagonist, a bright young boy named Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), whose astounding true story was first recounted in Jon Krakauer's book which gives the picture its title. Christopher had it all: loving parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) and sister (Jena Malone), excellent grades and a most promising future. Then, one fine day the 20-year old college graduate decided that wasn't really what he wanted, took his law school fund and disappeared, setting out for a journey to the heart of America. 'I'm going into the wild' the self-renamed Alex Supertramp wrote in his journal, and though he occasionally ran into people (Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn and others) he would connect with in a deeper way, that's where he really belonged: away from civilization, just him, his elementary tools and the pure, untarnished nature surrounding him.Christopher's journey, which is carried out with just the basic resources one needs to survive (no cell phone or other gadgets), is a modern odyssey of sorts, a quest for something that was lost forever and won't be found in the near future. In a world like ours, where technology rules all, a choice like Christopher's would be met with disbelief and probably derision. That only heightens the intensity of the character's message, which is also what the director aims to tell us: we need to rediscover ourselves before it's too late. It doesn't matter whether we are young or old, as the protagonist touchingly teaches an elderly man (Hal Holbrook, the only cast-member to be nominated for an Oscar), the important thing is we give it a serious try.To simply call this a film isn't enough: in one of the most amazing combinations of efforts in the history of movie-making, the story, Penn's soulful direction, Hirsch's painfully real performance (will he ever be this good again?) and Eddie Vedder's elegiac songs (an essential soundtrack for any true film-lover) merge into something that's almost too powerful to describe in words: you have to see it to believe it.Into the Wild isn't an 'easy' film: it will leave you very affected, possibly devastated, but also as enriched as one can ever be after seeing a genuine masterwork. It will ignite real thoughts about life instead of the phony reflections so many 'issue movies' try to induce. It will hit the gut, the heart and the mind in equal measure, and once the initial wave of emotional overflow has passed you will feel immensely rewarded. Into the Wild does this because it isn't merely a motion picture: it is art, life, freedom and nature, all together in a mesmerizing piece of visual poetry.",10,26,45,20 May 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Weird and hard to understand, but captivating nonetheless
","When I saw this movie for the first time, at the age of 14, I actually hated it: it was too slow (I had to repeatedly press the fast forward button on the remote control, especially during the last 20 minutes) and I did absolutely not get the ending. It took me two more viewings to understand that was the point: nothing ever happens quickly, man's rise to power was a slow process and therefore humanity's decline (Kubrick's favorite theme), as depicted here, should require an equally long amount of time.In fact, the director's idea is that often our greatest accomplishments are in reality an anticipation of decay. This is shown most clearly in the (very) long opening sequence, where a mysterious black monolith appears and presumably affects the planet's inhabitants (apes), as they learn to use bones as weapons, thus getting one step closer to progress but also much closer to extinction.The movie then cuts to a different era, in one of the most beautiful images of sci-fi cinema: one of the apes throws a bone in the air and as it goes back down it morphs into a spaceship. Apart from skipping centuries or even millennia in a very creative way, this also has the purpose of underlining the connection between the prologue and the rest of the film which, as indicated by the title, takes place far away from Earth in a distant (at the time this movie was made, that is) future. In particular, the focus is on a space station where a group of astronauts, led by David Bowman (Keir Dullea), are helped by a supercomputer named HAL 9000. HAL is, by his own definition, absolutely perfect and incapable of doing anything wrong. Or at least he was before the black monolith started showing up again, causing the machine to behave strangely and put the men's lives at risk (this was later reused by Kubrick, albeit differently, in Full Metal Jacket). What is happening? What is that black object, and what does it do?These questions remain unanswered, and given the director was the most notorious perfectionist in the history of cinema there has to be a good reason. Perhaps the answer is to be found in Kubrick's personal opinion about films: he believed watching movies was similar to dreaming, which is why some of his most famous works feature dream-related material (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and the nightmarish, pun not intended, Eyes Wide Shut). In his mind, images were much more powerful than words, hence the limited dialogue in 2001: like in a dream, what really matters is what we see, not what we hear. Kubrick lets the visual elements speak by themselves, with nothing more than classical music as a companion (the 'dancing' space vehicles and asteroids are among the most fascinating and iconic shots ever). When someone speaks, it is merely to move the plot forward, even though in one specific moment (the last scene where HAL 'appears') it is used to highlight the film's most ironically moving sequence.Dreams are intriguing because we do not always understand their meaning and usually only remember a few images. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same: maybe the epilogue will never make sense, but the visual memories that have been left behind ensure the movie has a well deserved place in any Top 50 list of the greatest pictures of all time.",10,5,12,23 July 2007
Blood Diamond," A bit uneven in tone and focus, but interesting and carried by a gripping double act
","Blood Diamond, Edward Zwick's latest feature, is supposed to do three things at the same time: a) make the audience feel guilty about the controversy surrounding 'conflict diamonds', its point being we don't just ignore the problem, but actually support it; b) expose, not afraid of showing cruel details, the problem of child-soldiers, another problem that keeps haunting Africa (and South America, as seen in City of God); c) tell a story, in pure Hollywood tradition, of redemption and reconciliation, connected with the previous two issues. Now, the title seems to suggest Zwick's first aim should be the one that resonates with most energy. Oddly, it doesn't, the anti-diamond lecture being overshadowed by the children's exploitation subplot and its role in the main narrative.The film is set in Sierra Leone, one of the most profitable zones when it comes to finding and selling certain precious little stones. One of these is found by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a local who has been taken away from his family and used as a slave by one of the area's most powerful crime-lords. Once the latter is arrested, everything should go back to normal. Unfortunately, he manages to break out and decides to get back at Solomon, who refused to give him the diamond, by kidnapping his son and slowly turning the young boy into a cold, emotionless killing machine. Overwhelmed by despair, Solomon is willing to do anything to get his son back. And that's where Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) enters the game: a cynical mercenary with no concern whatsoever for other human beings, he accepts to help the grief-stricken family man in exchange for the infamous diamond, while a journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) tries to convince him he can become a better man.The screenplay stages the classic confrontation between two radically opposed lines of thought, showing how both can learn something from the other and hopefully get to the end of the movie with a new set of values. This situation also occurred in Zwick's previous film, The Last Samurai, another story of honor and redemption, and both pictures got their main strength from the performances: much like Ken Watanabe, Hounsou is the film's real soul, injecting pain and humanity into the kind of character that would be used as the villain in more traditional flicks; and like Tom Cruise, Di Caprio shows he is capable of some really serious acting, although he should have received the Academy Award nomination (and won the Oscar, hadn't it been for Forest Whitaker) for The Departed instead of this movie. Why? Mostly because of the accent: even if he nails the South-African vocal quirks from his very first scene, every time he speaks it seems like his spot-on delivery and the rest of his intense work belong to two different worlds, whereas in Martin Scorsese's masterful gangster tale the Boston accent and the body language merged into the Titanic star's most accomplished and compelling role so far. Nevertheless, he has enough charisma to carry the plot, as opposed to Connelly who struggles to give something more to an essentially clichéd character.The relationship between Danny and Solomon enables Zwick to lend extra weight to the scenes involving the grueling mental torture African children are subjected to in order to 'serve their country' as miniaturized assassins. It's all stuff that has been filmed before, but the director knows what buttons to push to make the material shocking and, given it involves at least one person the audience should care about, a little upsetting.By focusing on these elements with more interest, Zwick ironically fails to successfully convey what was intended to be the movie's big message (conflict diamonds are bad, okay?). Even the epilogue, where he ties together the main narrative and the two 'important' themes he was supposed to explore, causes a sort of mixed reaction: while it is easy to root for the characters and cheer or cry because of how things turn out for them, chances of people starting to boycott 'blood diamonds' after seeing this film are quite limited.",7,1,1,17 July 2007
Pride & Prejudice," A stylish and funny romance.
","Before this film, I had never seen a Jane Austen adaptation, or even read any of her books. The closest I'd ever come was when I saw Bridget Jones's Diary, which is practically a modern version of Pride & Prejudice. Then I finally got to see the new P&P, and it was much better than I expected. The ending was a bit predictable, since I had watched the previously mentioned Bridget's Diary (but frankly, aren't all romantic comedies a little predictable?), but that didn't matter, because Pride & Prejudice is a remarkable, astounding picture.Set in 1797, the film chronicles the life of the Bennet family, whose 'matriarch' (Brenda Blethyn) is very eager to make sure her daughters get married as soon as possible. Actually, to define her 'eager' is a huge understatement. Anyway, the focus is on two Bennet sisters in particular: Jane (Rosamund Pike) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). The former is attracted to Mr Bingley, a slightly funny-looking, but nice man, whereas Lizzie has to deal with the silly Mr Collins (Tom Hollander, in a small but amusing role), and, most of all, the cold, ambiguous Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). She can't stand him, and he doesn't seem very enthusiastic about her either, their like/don't like relationship being the core of the movie.The film's greatness lies in the fact that first-time director Joe Wright makes an 'old school' romance look fresh and interesting. The way men courted and proposed to women may seem a bit dated, but it's so true and utterly believable, it makes you wish all rom-coms were this good. Silence is as important as words, and locations and weather also have a crucial part in the matters of the heart (rarely has rain looked so romantic).What also impressed me is of course Knightley: it's her best performance to date, as she makes Lizzie Bennet one of the most convincing characters to have ever appeared in a period piece (her Oscar-nom was slightly unexpected, but fully deserved). Macfadyen is absolutely perfect as Darcy, a complex role brought to life with top class elegance and style. But it's the older thespians who deserve more attention: Blethyn's Mrs Bennet is just a little OTT, while Judi Dench's presence is as memorable as her equally brief, yet flawless, appearance in Shakespeare In Love. The standout, however, is Donald Sutherland as the only male member of the Bennets. He's on screen for quite short time, but thanks to the right lines and attitude in the right moment, he's totally impeccable. Should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination, in my opinion.Overall, Pride & Prejudice is an incredibly pleasant experience. Watch it, and you will understand why, after several adaptations, Jane Austen's classic still conquers audiences everywhere.",9,4,7,23 February 2006
Alice in Wonderland," A little trip to Burtonland
","Perhaps more than any other Tim Burton project, his 'reimagining' of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland was anticipated with a healthy mix of excitement and preoccupation: on the one hand, Carroll's wonderfully bewildering literary universe is perfect for Burton's visionary quirks, and it also marks a welcome return to more 'audience-friendly' features after the magnificently gory Sweeney Todd; on the other, the fact that the director's former employee, Disney (already famously associated with Alice in the past), with whom his professional relationship has been a bit unpleasant to say the least (he got sacked after making Frankenweenie because his vision was too 'unconventional'), had a hand in the project, it was reasonable to suspect the House of Mouse would impose certain restrictions on Burton's creative decisions. Luckily, as it turns out, he walked out of that 'battle' mostly unscathed.Mixing Carroll's original novel and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton (of Beauty and the Beast fame) distance themselves from previous adaptations by depicting Alice not as a child, but as a 19-year old girl (played by In Treatment's Mia Wasikowska). Bored by the high society life of 19th century England, she notices the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) at a party and follows him. She finds a hole, falls into it and ends up in Wonderland, or, as the locals call it, Underland. There she reunites with old friends like the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the smoking Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), all of whom tell her she is meant to defeat the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), according to a prophecy. Only problem is, Alice has no recollection whatsoever of her past experiences in Underland...The key difference between this Alice and other ones, aside from the character's age, is Burton's decision to turn Carroll's prose into a coherent movie plot, rather than a string of disjointed episodes. This is, at once, an asset but also the film's main weakness (aside from the gratuitous use of 3D, which isn't very surprising since it was added after filing had wrapped): although it allows for proper character arcs (the script's insistence on giving the Hatter a solid back-story explains why Depp is the first actor billed in the credits, aside from his bankability), it also means the movie slips into a formulaic dead end during the third act which, while fun, is a clear sign of Disney's wish to end the picture in a Harry Potter-like fashion (the comparison is also justified by the coincidence of having four Potter alumni in the cast).From any other standpoint, however, the film is a joy to behold: despite the PG rating (for 'fantasy action/violence' and, hilariously, 'a smoking caterpillar'), Burton gets to go anywhere he wants with his visual inventiveness, delivering a spellbinding world (part real sets, part CGI, all gorgeous) that is enthralling and creepy at the same time: how many movies 'for kids' feature a scene where the heroine has to walk past a bunch of severed heads? Also, in true Burton fashion, the characters are a delightful group of freaks, and the actors obviously enjoy playing them: the blatant show-stealing turns come from Burton faithfuls Depp and Bonham Carter, the former being loony yet affecting, the latter entertaining but also truly evil. Wasikowska, playing the 'straight' role, confirms her status as a young talent to watch, while other live-action treats come from Anne Hathaway and the villainous Crispin Glover. As for the voice talent, it's as good as one should expect when people like Rickman, Sheen, Timothy Spall and Christopher Lee are involved.In short, for all its flaws, Alice in Wonderland remains a pleasant experience. It may not qualify as essential Burton, but it's still a lot better than his take on Planet of the Apes.",8,2,7,11 March 2010
Avatar," The future is here
","Hype can be a very dangerous thing. Though it is a valuable marketing tool, it can also raise expectations to a point beyond which it becomes quite inevitable that the film in question will disappoint at least on one level. In the case of Avatar, promises of a new, 'revolutionary' film-making style came along with the fact that for an entire generation of film-lovers - i.e. those who were born in the '90s - James Cameron is a genius, but also the pompous buffoon who proclaimed himself 'King of the world' when Titanic broke box-office records and won 11 Oscars (some of which should have gone to L.A. Confidential). This time, however, the hype was entirely justified: Avatar, Cameron's first feature project in 12 years, is indeed an amazing achievement.Returning to his genre of choice, namely science-fiction, the director takes us to a new world, named Pandora, an ideal place for colonization in a future where most of Earth's resources have run out (a subtle social commentary?). Since the air on Pandora is toxic to humans, interactions with the indigenous population, called Na'vi, are made easier thanks to 'avatars': artificial human-Na'vi hybrids remotely controlled by selected members of a science program. One of these people is Jake Sully (a charismatic Sam Worthington), a crippled Marine who signs up for the gig when promised a chance to be able to walk again. His pragmatism takes a step back, however, when he learns to appreciate the lifestyle of the blue, huge, feline-shaped Na'vi and falls for one of them, the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). Problems begin when it becomes clear corporations and military (represented by Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang) don't care about the inhabitants, only the planet's resources. Which side will Jake choose?Yes, the story isn't very original: part Dances with Wolves, part Pocahontas, it's a classic Western film subject in a sci-fi environment. But it's also pure Cameron: man versus technology (ironic, given the director's penchant for pushing the technical envelope on every movie he makes), strong female characters (Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez and Ripley herself, aka Sigourney Weaver), tragic love (although the two blue creatures kissing gets close to ridiculous), James Horner's epic score (complete with a song over the end credits), grandiose battles. As is often the case, what matters is not what kind of story the director tells, but how he does it.And how does Cameron do it? He takes us to strange, new worlds with an energy and a passion reminiscent of Peter Jackson (Pandora does look a bit like Middle Earth in places), providing a feast for the eyes without ever losing track of the story. To achieve this, he personally developed a new 3D camera and waited over a decade for visual effects to be sufficiently evolved. His patience is well rewarded: instead of the usual 'object being thrown at you' effect that is associated with 3D movies, his use of the technology allows one to totally embrace his creation, thanks to a unique sense of depth that gives the impression one actually is there with the characters. Naturally, the third dimension adds extra spectacle come the massive final showdown (which packs a neat Aliens reference, thus uniting the two Camerons - guerrilla auteur and ambitious blockbuster-maker), but the focus is always on setting and characters first, action second.Avatar is an important film, a fundamental achievement in the entertainment industry. Its existence doesn't mark the death of traditional film-making (honestly, who would want to watch Bergman or Godard in 3D?), but it is a new, exciting side of the art of bringing stories to the big screen. Make no mistake: this is a film that has to be seen in cinemas, and for once, the extra dimension makes all the difference.",9,0,3,12 February 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Hell, yeah!
","The first thought that comes to mind upon seeing Drag Me to Hell is 'there's no place like home'. For Sam Raimi, 'home' means the edgy, subversive horror movies that kick-started his career, a genre he returns to after a two-decade break (The Gift is actually a regular thriller with a few supernatural elements) for two reasons: a) he needed a pause for breathing after three consecutive Spider-Man movies (and a fourth one planned for 2011), the last of which received mixed reviews to say the least; b) who better than him to prove that his production company Ghost House Pictures is capable of making scary films and not just miscalculated efforts like The Grudge and Boogeyman?The picture tells the story of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an ambitious girl who handles loans in a bank hoping she will soon get a richly deserved - in her opinion, that is - promotion. In order for that to happen, though, she needs to be able to deal with tough decisions, her boss (David Paymer) tells her. And so the young girl refuses to grant Mrs. Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) a third extension on her mortgage, since doing the opposite would be a career-damaging move. Unfortunately, the old lady - who happens to be a gypsy - isn't very forgiving, in fact she assaults Christine in a parking lot and subsequently lays a terrible curse upon her: after three days, the Lamia (a goat-demon) will take her to Hell for all eternity. With her boyfriend (Justin Long) suspecting she might be losing her mind and demon 'experts' (Dileep Rao and Adriana Barraza) largely clueless as to what should be done, Christine only has 72 hours to come up with a way to save her soul.Although it was completely unintentional (Raimi says he and his brother Ivan wrote the script in the early '90s), Drag Me to Hell stands out as a very relevant movie in these financially unstable times: whereas blockbusters like The International depict banks as the Big Bad with less than thrilling results, this film revives that satirical streak which defined several great horror flicks in the '60s and '70s (Romero's zombie cycle being the obvious quality example) and has been conspicuously missing lately (barring Joe Dante's Iraq-related episode of Masters of Horror, which, appropriately enough, featured zombies). From the get-go, Raimi has us all hooked on one point: at present, it's a lot of fun to watch a banker get in all kinds of trouble.Then again, Raimi doesn't really care about politics or social subtext; what he wants to do is scare people as much as possible. That he manages to do so despite the obvious limitations of the PG-13 rating (The Evil Dead, his feature debut, was originally banned in several countries for its OTT violence) speaks volumes about his deep understanding of the genre, and also unveils a long lost truth: you don't need gallons of blood and torture - the current trend in horror productions - to make a good scary picture, as long as you have an intriguing premise, a spooky mood and the right jump-in-your-seat set-pieces. Naturally, this being a Sam Raimi film, the horror comes with a peculiar mix of absurd, revolting humor, and the director succeeds in eliciting shocks and laughs in equal measure from a random series of objects, including a handkerchief (!) and a piece of cake.If one wants to complain, it could be pointed out that some minor characters - notably Reggie Lee's opportunistic bank employee - are blatantly two-dimensional, and the dialogue is occasionally corny even by B-movie standards ('And after the third day, the demon will come to take you.', says a psychic, to which Christine replies: 'Take me where?'). But hey, this is, at heart, a B-movie, so any narrative 'misstep' (such as the deliberately stereotypical depiction of the gypsies) is easily forgiven. Besides, who watches this kind of movie for the story or the supporting characters? What matters here is Christine and her horrific conflict with an elderly nemesis. Lohman is terrific, suffering all forms of physical abuse while still retaining the necessary charisma to make us care for her fate, in pure Bruce Campbell fashion (Raimi's favorite collaborator was, unfortunately, unable to appear in the movie), and Raver is one of the best horror creations of the decade, doing her best with a role that essentially requires her to scream, spit, drool or vomit.Long story short: Drag Me to Hell may be bloodless, but it's a visceral, relentless, inventive fright-fest, complete with a straightforward title (it does exactly what it says on the tin). If there has to be a message, make it the following: Spider-Sam's still got it.",9,1,4,2 July 2009
Mission: Impossible," Stylish TV remake.
","After Carlito's Way, all of Brian De Palma's movies have been more about style than content. When the plot and characters weren't good enough to keep the film interesting, we got crap like Femme Fatale. When, on the other hand, De Palma had an intelligent script and a reliable cast to work with, the result was quite pleasant. Mission:Impossible belongs to the second category.Based on the popular TV show from the '60s, the movie starts with Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), leader of IMF (Impossible Mission Force), preventing the latest terrorist plot before receiving a new assignment ('This message will self-destruct in five seconds'): he has to locate and arrest a double agent. The problem is, his whole team, including himself, gets wiped out during the mission. Only Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left, which brings his superiors to a 'logical' conclusion: he has to be the traitor. Alone and on the run, Hunt has to prove his innocence and find the real dirty agent. He will receive some help from Claire (Emmanuelle Bèart), Jim's wife, computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and mercenary Krieger (Jean Reno). An impossible mission? Perhaps...As I already said, this film relies heavily on style, and De Palma artfully delivers when it comes to staging an exciting thriller. Two scenes in particular prove the Scarface director was the right man for the job. One sees Ethan trying to rob a maximum security vault whose alarm basically reacts even if you have to scratch your nose. That scene is loaded with suspense and is one of the best ever directed by De Palma. The other memorable bit is the final set piece (I'll just say three words: train, tunnel, chopper), which proves things can really get impossible in these movies.As for content, David Koepp's script is brilliant as long as it deals with the various conspiracies, but rather shallow in terms of character development. Take the IMF team at the beginning: they're so hastily introduced it's hard to feel for them when they're all killed five minutes later. Apart from Cruise, who manages to turn an otherwise one-dimensional protagonist into a charismatic lead, the only characters worth watching are Phelps (a superb Voight) and Max, a criminal mastermind, masterfully underplayed by Vanessa Redgrave.All in all, not as good as De Palma's earlier works, but nonetheless quite stylish, charming and enjoyable, not to mention a really good adaptation of a TV series. If only other remakes (Charlie's Angels, for example) were this good.",8,7,12,4 May 2006
Saw," The game begins
","Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it's a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.According to the film's notorious back-story, it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange, given most of the action takes place in just two locations: one is a bathroom where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall, with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there; the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw, a serial killer whom Detectives Sing (Ken Leung) and Trapp (Danny Glover) have been tracking down for weeks.The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way: Jigsaw doesn't really kill anyone, but 'plays a game' with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon, as the tape recorder found in a dead man's hand tells them, each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other, or they will both die. Problem is, the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so, while the two unfortunate cell-mates have to choose who gets to live (that's Jigsaw's perverse logic: he offers you a choice), the police close in on the elusive psycho, whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it (though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it), the first installment takes advantage of its non-linear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and co-writer Whannell's eternal credit that they, like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker, went beyond slasher clichés and came up with something more. Okay, so Saw's philosophical undertones aren't entirely original, but what the heck, they do manage to keep the audience interested in what's going on. In addition, adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie's more gruesome parts (and there are a lot of them) don't come off as gratuitous bloodletting (for an example of the latter, look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th).Furthermore, the intelligence behind the film's structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances, given the acting is more convincing here than in most post-2000 shockers: Elwes and Whannell's desperation is conveyed with an intensity that's almost too painful to behold, Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon in-joke (you know, the 'too old for this sh*t' gag) and when Jigsaw himself appears... well, it's the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze - chilling and impossible to forget (and, for once, not played by Kevin Spacey). Just like the movie.",9,64,81,3 November 2008
Life Is Beautiful," The best Italian movie ever made
","Okay, perhaps I overdid it in my summary. Better movies have come out of Italy, but still, La Vita è bella deserves to be in a Top 50, if not Top 10. It really does.With this film, comedian Roberto Benigni had a huge responsibility: to amuse people, without making them forget it's a story about one of the most awful periods in human history.He has succeeded admirably, making a true masterpiece, which also perfectly defines the concept of 'dramatic comedy'.The first part, with Jewish waiter Guido Orefice(Benigni) getting in trouble with an arrogant Fascist(or,as he calls him, 'lo scemo delle uova', the eggs-idiot)while he courts the latter's fiancée, Dora(Benigni's actual wife Nicoletta Braschi), aka 'Principessa', is pure entertainment.The trouble,as well as the really funny bits, starts six years later, as Guido, Dora and their son Giosué(Giorgio Cantarini)are taken to a Nazi camp.To make sure his son doesn't worry, Guido tells him it's a game, and that they have to stay there until they've scored 1000 points.That's the movie's real strength: it's heartbreaking to watch the conditions in which the prisoners are, but we can't stop laughing when we see the various tricks used by our hero to keep his little boy unaware of what's really going on (the scene where he translates the Nazi orders in Italian is priceless).Another director would probably have focused more on just the laughs or just the tear-inducing scenes, Benigni, on the other hand, has created a perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, one of the best movies in history, not to mention the best one he's ever made.",9,3,7,9 October 2005
Up," Pixar keeps going up (pun not intended)
","More than the consistent quality of its work, Pixar has a certain boldness going for it. What other animation studio could possibly get away with a film where the main character is a rat (Ratatouille), or one that is practically silent for the first 40 minutes (Wall-E)? Up is another impressive gamble, since it does what few other 'kid's movies' have tried: having a grumpy old man as the protagonist.The old man in question is Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), a retired loner whose house is about to be demolished. Unwilling to move to a retirement home, he does the unthinkable: he decides to go on an adventurous journey he has dreamed about since childhood, and takes the house with him thanks to a lot of helium balloons. The only problem is, a boy scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) has come along for the ride, which takes the unlikely duo to South America, where all kinds of strangeness await them.The great thing about Up is that, once again, the filmmakers have put story over technique, so while the picture may look gorgeous and boast a visual inventiveness worthy of alive-action adventure flick (including the chance to see it in 3D during its theatrical run), directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (aided by The Station Agent's Thomas McCarthy in the screenplay area) never lose sight of what really matters, i.e. a captivating plot and believable characters. In fact, the reason grumpy old Carl works as a leading man is that the film's opening act, which establishes his background, makes him instantly relatable, thanks to a narrative bravery that surpasses Wall-E's wordless first act and even beats the likes of Bambi and Dumbo in the tears department. It's a tough act to follow, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume the film runs out of steam after that scene.And yet this isn't the case, and it's all due to that unmistakably Pixar combination of thrills and laughs: from the perfect balancing act of Carl and Russell to the peril represented by one Charles Muntz (a textbook Disney villain voiced by the terrific Christopher Plummer), Up has something for everyone, including a brilliant spin on the age-old cartoon conceit of talking animals and bizarre sidekicks (a giant bird named Kevin, anyone?). It's an exhilarating ride that never ceases to entertain and move, a new confirmation of the fact that John Lasseter truly is the new Walt Disney.In short, Up is a new high for Pixar, with yet another example of good storytelling used to make an improbable premise into an animation masterpiece and a gruff old fellow into an iconic character. It's like Eastwood's Gran Torino, but with more heart and lots of hilarious talking dogs. What's not to love?",9,0,0,5 June 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick's most chilling study of human evil
","For the entirety of his career, Stanley Kubrick was interested in one universal theme: mankind's decay, both mental and physical. This led to some of the most intense and frightening depictions of pure insanity, as seen in The Shining or Full Metal Jacket, but none as powerful and consistently relevant as the shocking A Clockwork Orange.The notorious trailer consisted of quick glimpses of some key scenes, with words such as 'funny', 'exciting' and 'Beethoven' written on them. Only the third word is spot-on - the rest is, at best, an example of bitter irony. How come? Because the only one who could possibly find the events of this film funny or exciting is the deranged protagonist, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Actually, 'deranged' is the wrong adjective to use with him: 'paradoxical' is better. And what's so paradoxical about this young man? Well, he's intelligent and cheerful, with a soft spot for 'the divine work of Ludwig Van', as he calls Beethoven, and enjoys hanging out with his friends (or 'droogs'). The problem is, his idea of spending time is best summed up by an expression he uses in the chilling opening sequence, where the camera catches his insane stare and goes backwards to reveal the bizarre pub he's visiting: 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He's never perfectly happy unless he can beat, rape or (in one extreme case) kill someone. Everything appears to change when he's sent to jail for murder and undergoes a treatment that makes him completely incapable to commit violent or perverted acts ever again. However, this 'cure' is a double-edged sword, as it also means he can't defend himself when his victims come back for revenge.It's the second section that constitutes the real heart of A Clockwork Orange. Much has been said about the film's use of on-screen violence and how it supposedly affected people upon its original release in 1971 (protests led to it being banned in England until the director's death) , and while it must have been a shock back then, most of the incriminated scenes look rather tame today (see Bonnie and Clyde for a similar argument). The notable exception is the famous brainwash sequence, which will probably never lose its sheer emotional power. That's because it represents Kubrick's real concern: the loss of free will, which will eventually turn all of us into mindless drones and lead to nothing but tragedy (the latrine shootout in Full Metal Jacket derives from this). The film was shot so that it would appear to be set in a not-so-distant future, but in a time where the media manipulate unsuspecting viewers and listeners every day, it is clear that the director saw it happening and tried to warn us. The use of violence was an inevitable part of this: the stronger the message, the more effective the reception.This strength comes not only from the haunting images and the terrifying irony (Alex sings 'Singin' In The Rain', the ultimate feel-good tune, while raping a woman), but also and most prominently from the groundbreaking central performance: McDowell, almost a complete unknown at the time (not to mention pushing 30, while Alex is supposed to be something like ten years younger), seized the opportunity and delivered a portrait of absolute, unmatched evil, so powerful it is sadly obvious why he hasn't done anything as astounding since. Anthony Hopkins may have won an Oscar for playing a serial killer, but it was McDowell who forever raised the bar for cinematic inhumanity.Overall, A Clockwork Orange is like any other film by Kubrick: it has to be seen multiple times before its full significance can be grasped, it will upset and infuriate some, and it's an experience like few others. For its unprecedented boldness as to content and delivery, it is also the great director's best picture.",10,2,5,6 October 2008
The Fly," Pure Visceral Horror
","I've read that David Cronenberg considers this film one of his most mainstream efforts, which is weird, considering some critics tend to use The Fly as the perfect example the Canadian auteur DOESN'T do mainstream. Well, in my opinion, it's both.The story is certainly a very conventional one: a scientist's (Jeff Goldblum) experiment goes wrong and he turns into a monster. What's unusual about it is the way Croenberg merges the body horror with romance and ultimately uses the terrifying scenario as a reflection on identity (see also Dead Ringers and A History of Violence for further developments of the same theme).Goldblum shines as Seth Brundle, the eccentric genius whose genetic structure is combined with a fly's during a teleportation experiment, an accident which has serious consequences: Seth gradually becomes a 'Brundlefly', who possesses extraordinary physical abilities (that stage of the metamorphosis reminds of Peter Parker's transformation into Spider-Man) as well as an insatiable sexual hunger (possible reference to Cronenberg's directorial debut, Shivers). Soon enough, though, he and his girlfriend (Geena Davis) realize things are getting very bad (the scene where Seth quotes Kafka to describe his condition is brilliant, another proof this ain't a conventional horror flick)...Alongside the acting, the other impressive thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning make-up: rarely has a creature looked so real and revolting (and there's no CGI involved).And finally, The Fly has one of the best director cameos ever: Cronenberg plays the gynecologist in the infamous 'nightmare abortion' sequence (a landmark in horror cinema).For fans of the genre, this is something you just can't miss.",10,1,2,15 January 2006
Reservoir Dogs," A modern master's flawless debut
","Pulp Fiction made him a worldwide phenomenon, but it was the very first screening of Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut, at Sundance in 1992, that proved Quentin Tarantino, a former video store clerk with no formal training behind the camera (except for a failed experiment called My Best Friend's Birthday), was a force to be reckoned with: mixing Sergio Leone, the French New Wave and Asain thrillers in the same package (and adding a lot more on the way), his first feature doesn't boast that much originality, but it has energy, passion, violence and wit.Ostensibly a classic heist flick, Dogs is about a bunch of criminals who are brought together by the edgy Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to perform an apparently flawless robbery. These people have no real names, at least not when they're together: job-wise, they will just be known as Mr. White (Harvey Keitel, one of the driving forces behind this film's making), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker), Mr. Brown (QT himself) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). With some minor help from Joe's son 'Nice Guy' Eddie (Chris Penn), things should go smoothly.Obviously, they don't: by the time the opening credits are over, we know the job went wrong, as the surviving 'dogs' (including a seriously injured Orange) gather in a warehouse and try to figure out what happened. Through a clever use of non-linear narrative, we learn how they were approached by Joe, the aftermath of the heist (the robbery itself is never depicted on-screen) and their suspicions regarding a potential undercover cop in the group.The storytelling technique is obviously borrowed from Jean-Luc Godard, who famously said: 'A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order' (coincidentally, QT's production company, A Band Apart, is also named after one of Godard's movies). The plot, however, is the smallest of Tarantino's concerns. What really matters here is the execution, the style. And what a style: the seamless merger of images and music (see the opening credits), with the additional brilliant idea of having virtually all the songs (no original tunes here) come from an internal source, namely a radio program, the Scorsese-inspired long takes, the innovative use of violence (excessive but often amusing, rather than revolting, as in the famous torture scene).And then, of course, there's the dialogue, the primary reason to watch any of Tarantino's films. The audience at Sundance was memorably shocked by the opening sequence, which explains nothing about the story but gives precious insight regarding the characters: Mr. White has a short temper, Mr. Pink doesn't believe in tipping and Mr. Brown is firmly convinced Madonna's 'Like A Virgin' has a pretty crude significance (in true QT style, the language is not something the easily offended will embrace). That's just one of many quotable sound-bites, which also showcase the talent of Tarantino's ensemble cast: the standouts are Keitel, Roth and the psychotic Madsen, but everyone, even Bunker, whose role is - on the surface - less prominent, gets a well deserved moment of screen immortality.The cast (Keitel most notably) is also further proof of how Reservoir Dogs doesn't 'look' like a traditional '90s first feature. Unlike Clerks, which was deliberately constructed like a home-made extravaganza, Dogs never flaunts its small scale or limited locations (the bulk of the movie takes place in the warehouse). It's a little movie that thinks big, and the Weinstein brothers were clever enough to see it in 1992, when they bought the film and gave Tarantino free reins to do whatever the hell he wanted after that. The rest, as they say, is recent motion picture history.",10,2,6,23 October 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's final masterwork: a haunting, compelling nightmare
","Due to the advertising and rumors surrounding the plot (not to mention the stunt-casting of real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as the central married couple) most people expected this film, Stanley Kubrick's last picture, to be an explicit story of sex and adultery. I expected it too, to be honest. I couldn't have been more wrong: Eyes Wide Shut is one of the coldest, most unsettling studies of love and betrayal ever made, one that acquires new meanings as the years go by.Set in New York (but actually shot in London), the film's bizarre chain of events starts at a party, a typical Kubrickian context, where Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) and his spouse Alice (Kidman) are among the guests. While his wife elegantly tells a suitor to get lost, Bill is asked to help the host (played with eerie charm by Sydney Pollack) revive a naked girl who has accidentally OD:d in a bathroom. Though visibly shocked by these events, the physician returns home and calmly follows his usual routine. One night, however, an argument between him and Alice leads to the latter revealing she fantasized about sleeping with another man during a holiday. Stunned by the cruelly honest confession, Bill leaves the house and spends the rest of the night wandering around, the image of his wife having an affair prompting him to seek revenge: at first he considers having sex with a prostitute, then he decides to attend a party a friend told him about, only to run into something bigger than imagined and almost risk his life.Superficially, Eyes Wide Shut can be considered a sex film, but it is in fact much deeper: with only one actual 'sex' scene (apart from the infamous orgy sequence and Bill's visions) in the whole movie, the focus is more on what love and commitment imply and demand. Naturally, being this a Kubrick film, no happiness should be expected: so chilling it actually makes Mike Nichols' Closer look like a comedy, EWS leaves no room for comfort or relief, the cynical closing line being the definitive punch in the stomach for anyone hoping things would go differently.Moreover, the wonderfully strange title suggests this movie might be the one that most reflects the director's view on cinema: film is like a dream. In this case, it is a frightening nightmare, and even though there are clues that seem to prove Bill's harrowing experience took place in his mind alone the ghostly atmosphere never leaves.Scariest of all, though, are the fearless anti-performances Cruise and Kidman deliver: combining the original script with whatever problems they might have had at the time (one should keep in mind their divorce was finalized less than two years after the movie's release), they expose the darkest sides of marriage with a brutal sincerity that clearly indicates there is no, or very little, acting involved. And while Cruise used his role and that of Frank Mackey in Magnolia (his best work to date) to prove he could handle more difficult characters, Kidman's surprisingly raw portrayal of disappointment and secret lust was the first of many parts (Moulin Rouge!, The Hours and Dogville in particular) that showed the world she was actually a great actress and not just the Top Gun star's wife.With its layered thematic content, expert execution and brave cast, Eyes Wide Shut is a fascinating last film from one of cinema's undisputed masters, and like all other Kubrick pictures it repays repeated viewings like few are able to. A little warning, nevertheless: it is not recommended if you get nightmares easily.",10,1,2,27 July 2007
Inside Man," A smart, rewarding thriller that sees Spike Lee return to form
","When Empire magazine listed the 25 best movies of 2006, Inside Man was part of that list (number 19, to be more precise), and the brief review of Spike Lee's latest big screen outing read: 'First time in ages he's done the right thing!'. Now, I don't think it's the first time in years he's made a good film (I mean, what about the superb 25th Hour, which was released less than half a decade ago?), but it sure as hell marks a return to form after the interesting, but uneven, She Hate Me (2004). The problem with that movie was that it had enough material for two or three different films, with Lee trying to put it all in one flick. This time, though, he sticks to the main plot, with only one or two short digressions, thus delivering one of last year's most accessible and enjoyable films.On the surface, Inside Man may look like just another heist movie. The fact that it isn't is highlighted from the beginning, the opening sequence featuring Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaking straight to the camera and telling the audience he has a plan to pull off the perfect bank robbery. And within a couple of minutes from that scene, he puts his plan into action, using a very simple trick (posing as a painter) to enter a New York bank and ensure everyone cooperates. Naturally, it doesn't take that long before the NYPD is contacted and sends detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to negotiate with Russell. In the meantime, someone has told the bank's owner, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), about the ongoing robbery, and the old man, desperate to conceal some big secret, asks a woman named Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to help him. What was meant to be an ordinary crime has therefore become a mind game between the cop, the robber and the mysterious lady.In the hands of another filmmaker, this could have been a pretty formulaic genre film. However, this is a Spike Lee joint, so there's much more than the usual good guy/bad guy showdown. Inside Man is both exciting, funny and intelligent, Lee taking his time to briefly explore other territories as well. A scene where a Sikh hostage is mistaken for a terrorist ('Sh*t! A f*cking Arab!') is a brilliant example of how to use (grotesque) humor to criticize the times we live in, and there's almost a Michael Mann-esquire feel to the relationship between Frazier and Russell, particularly when the two discuss the former's reluctance to getting married. Washington has plenty of fun and proves a convincing lead, even when he's making fun of himself ('I've got them right where I want'em', he tells his partner; 'Where's that?' 'Right behind me with my pants around my ankles, but it's a start') and Owen is brilliant as the cunning thief, despite a less convincing American accent than the one he adopted in Sin City, because he's got the best material to work on: we don't care about his motive, partly since it's pretty clear he's not after the money, but we keep watching nonetheless, because his methods are fascinating. As for Foster, she's an intriguing presence, although the audience could have benefited from a little more insight on a woman so manipulative she's called 'a magnificent c*nt' by the mayor of New York.So, Spike Lee may not be Christopher Nolan, and Inside Man certainly isn't Memento, but it is undoubtedly one of the most compelling films of 2006. Let's hope Lee keeps making them like this...",9,1,2,18 January 2007
Pulp Fiction," Ignore the Academy: this is the best picture of 1994
","And the Oscar goes to...Forrest Gump? With all due respect, Gump may be a very good film, but both The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction were more deserving of winning Best Picture of 1994 (as well as some other awards). Now, the latter may have been too innovative, weird or extreme back then, but the French knew what they were doing when Pulp received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, beginning its route to being recognized as one of the most influential pictures of the '90s (alongside Fight Club, it's also my all-time favorite movie). Whereas Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino's debut film, told one story by jumping back and forth in time (similarly to Stanley Kubrick's The Killing), his second masterpiece gets more ambitious, combining separate episodes in a non-linear way: it starts with two thieves (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discussing new places to rob; then there are two gangsters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) who fulfill various assignments for their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) while talking about foot massages and French cheeseburgers (a smart and funny detour from the stereotyped taciturn hit men we are used to); later, Vince has to take Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for dinner, with shocking and hilarious results; and finally, there is also a boxer (Bruce Willis) who is trying to sever his ties with organized crime. And somehow all these events are connected, in unexpected, genuinely amusing ways.The chronological structure might irritate some viewers, but fundamentally the plot is merely an instrument to allow the characters to interact. And what interaction: Tarantino's dialogue is sharp and exhilarating, showing that when you hand it to the right people even the most absurd subject is a pleasure to listen to. From Jackson quoting the Bible ('And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...') to an awesome argument on how to get rid of a corpse (at which point the director himself, playing a minor role, delivers the priceless line: 'Did you see a sign outside my house that said 'Dead n**gger storage'?'), Pulp Fiction has one of the most quotable scripts of all time.How ironic then, that the film's most iconic and talked-about scene is completely wordless: Travolta and Thurman dancing to Chuck Berry's You Never Can Tell. It's the one sequence everybody knows, even if they haven't seen the movie, and it is still a great scene, largely thanks to the perfect chemistry between the two stars, and the rest of the cast lives up to the task as well: Jackson in particular is at his raging best, and he's easily matched by Travolta (whose career was dangerously close to a shameful end before he was offered the part of Vince), while the QT veterans (Roth, Harvey Keitel) and newcomers (Willis and, in a surreal monologue, Christopher Walken) slip into their roles as if they were wearing tailored suits. As for Thurman, look no further than the restaurant conversation between Mia and Vince to understand why she was the first and only choice to play the lead in Kill Bill.Witty, grotesque and brilliant (often at the same time), Pulp Fiction is a seminal '90s flick and without a doubt Tarantino's best work. There have been several rip-offs since then, but those are best ignored: nothing can match the sheer genius of the original, a film to watch, love and watch again.",10,0,3,23 October 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Overlong and occasionally dumb, but otherwise a pretty enjoyable blockbuster
","The best way of appreciating The Da Vinci Code is to be perfectly sure of your expectations. In my case, I knew exactly what I thought I would see: on the cover of the Italian edition, the original novel is defined 'a thriller by Dan Brown', not 'an essay on mankind's history by Dan Brown'. The book is 100% fiction and, while not a classic, it's entertaining enough if you have nothing else to do on a boring Saturday afternoon. The movie adaptation is just the same, and that's why I enjoyed it.Most critics, even those who didn't like the film (and there are plenty of them), claim the first fifteen minutes are the best. They've got a point: the opening sequence, where Jacques Saunière, the aged curator of the Louvre, is murdered by albino 'monk' Silas (Paul Bettany), is indeed quite chilling, setting the tone for subsequent events. The weird circumstances of Saunière's death (apparently, he left a series of clues on his own body right before biting the dust) lead to symbology expert Robert Langdon's (Tom Hanks) involvement. Unfortunately, a misinterpretation of certain signs make him the prime suspect, and with the help of the victim's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), he has to discover the truth, a truth which will see him, to paraphrase English historian Leigh Teabing (the scene-stealing Ian Mckellen), 'witness the biggest cover-up in human history'.It is said cover-up which has made some people (mostly over-religious) utterly hate The Da Vinci Code, because of its supposed 'blasphemy' and 'heresy'. Now, the theory at the center of the film is with no doubt intriguing (a part of it was already dealt with in Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, conveniently mentioned in Brown's source novel), but let's face it: is there anyone who would take that stuff seriously? I mean, The Last Temptation of Christ can be taken seriously, in spite of its 'upsetting' content, because it's a serious film. The Da Vinci Code, on the other hand, while dealing with interesting ideas (well, as interesting as they can get in an average mystery book), was made for only one reason: to be an exciting, entertaining summer blockbuster. Which it is.Despite the overused plot line (average guy ends up in something so much bigger than him), director Ron Howard keeps the pace and suspense at a constant level, proving his versatility once again. He also confirms his very good eye for casting: Tom Hanks is a convincing protagonist, mainly thanks to the fact that he doesn't look like your ordinary action hero, and is therefore an excellent choice as a Hitchcockian everyman in an unusual situation, while Jean Reno gives all of his natural roguish charm to the stubborn French cop who makes it his mission to arrest Langdon (it is reported that Brown created the character with Reno in mind, and it is hard not to believe it). But, as usual, it's the Brits who steal the show: Alfred Molina's ambiguous bishop won't please devout churchmen (but hey, if everyone complained for being misrepresented cinematically, then how often would the French, the Germans and the Russians have sued Hollywood by now?), but he is a charismatic presence; Bettany is downright terrifying as one of the most disturbed (and disturbing) psychos to have hit the screens, adding an extra edge to the darker side he had previously shown in Gangster No. 1; and let's not forget Sir Mckellen, who enters the game an hour into the movie and then practically walks away with it, thanks to a characterization that is over-the-top, but in a classy, English way.I still haven't mentioned Tautou, and that's because she is, despite trying her best, the weakest element in the film: best known for playing sweet, slightly naive women (as seen in the wonderful Amélie), she struggles to look convincing as a smart scholar, a fact that is particularly evident in the stretched epilogue, the only part of the movie that gets close to becoming utterly risible. However, this shouldn't detract from the merits of The Da Vinci Code, an unpretentious Hollywood thriller that sets out to entertain and succeeds most of the time, as long as the viewer knows it shouldn't be taken seriously. 7,5/10",7,2,4,20 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Welcome to Hogwarts-part 1...
","Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (I prefer to use the original British title) is a wonderful experience: good script, great visuals, extraordinary actors... However, there's a 'but', which is the following: it's excessively faithful to the source novel, leaving out only one or two side characters. The movie, which tells how a seemingly normal boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), discovers he is actually a wizard and starts attending a school named Hogwarts, encountering many dangers throughout his first year, isn't boring for a second during its 146 minutes, but the pace is occasionally slowed down because, like in other 'part 1 of 3' movies (actually, they're supposed to be 7), the director spends a lot of time introducing and explaining things, so he won't have to do it in the sequel(s). In this case, Chris Columbus, best known for Home Alone includes as much as possible also to make sure the target audience (kids) will enjoy it, adult viewers being more used to differences between book and film (and thus perhaps likely to find the running time a bit excessive). Nonetheless,the movie is great, Columbus using all the tools at his disposal to bring J. K. Rowling's enchanted universe to the screen. And the magic is in every single frame: from potions to talking hats to Quidditch games, it's pretty clear nothing ordinary can possibly happen, and all of it looks real, thanks to brilliantly accomplished special effects and CGI. But the movie's strength doesn't lie only in the visual aspect: there's also an impressive ensemble cast, consisting of some of Britain's finest actors. All of them are impressive, but it si of course the adult section of the cast that pulls off a superior job, having more experience and knowing how to add substance to an array of fascinating characters (standouts include Robbie Coltrane as a gigantic caretaker, Alan Rickman as a sinister teacher and of course Richard Harris, who plays Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore with unmatched charm and warmth).Aside from a few 'slow' bits, this is a good start for what will certainly be one of the defining franchises of the 21st century.To paraphrase Dumbledore: let the feast begin...",8,0,1,20 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter Episode IV: Return of the Dark Times
","In issue 107 of Total Film, in an article about 2005's summer blockbusters' commercial success, it was said that if Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had been released during the summer, we would have witnessed the ultimate box-office war: Potter vs. Star Wars (Revenge of the Sith was the most successful movie among those listed in the magazine). That article's author was right: it would have been a huge battle, since both HP4 and ROTS are the best episodes of their respective franchises (actually, ROTS shares the title with The Empire Strikes Back) and both deal with more mature situations and characters, as evil is about to make its triumphant return. And in the case of both movies, the PG-13 rating was justified, the darkness factor being doubled compared to previous installments (in the case of Goblet of Fire, we've also got a few puberty-related gags and dialogues which aren't exactly suitable for everyone). But enough with the Star Wars comparisons, let's talk about the teen wizard's individual merits.The most important thing is perhaps the new director, Mike Newell, who, knowing that it would be impossible to adapt the entire book, chooses to ditch most of the early section (chapters 2-5 are entirely missing) so that he can focus on the core of the movie: the Triwizard Tournament, a competition between wizardry schools in which Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is selected as the Hogwarts champion. This raises suspicions because a) he is too young to compete, and b) he did not put his name in the titular goblet, a magical object which selects the contestants. Add the fact that Voldemort's mark has started showing up again, and it is pretty clear this might be the teen wizard's most unusual year thus far.Because of the action/thriller-style plot, Newell does not just skip the introductory chapters, he also leaves most of the funny bits out, with the exception of the Yule Ball and the previously mentioned teenage-gags, proving he hasn't lost the sense of humor audiences learned to know in Four Weddings and a Funeral (minus the frequent swearing, of course). However, fans needn't worry: unlike Alfonso CuarÃ²n, who directed the third Potter opus, Newell hasn't cut subplots that will affect the sense of the main story, making Goblet of Fire the most enjoyable installment in the franchise. (I didn't actually realize several subplots has been left out until I came back home after the viewing).The other important element, as always with the HP saga, is the cast: the original actors are still convincing and use all their screen time extremely well(particularly Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, their roles being downsized to cameos), and the new entries are good too: Miranda Richardson is brilliant in her comic turn as gossip-journalist Rita Skeeter (as opposed to her villain in Sleepy Hollow), David Tennant is remarkably effective as Death-Eater Barty Crouch Jr.(I'm curious to see what he'll be like as the new Doctor Who next year), and a special mention is required for Brendan Gleeson, who plays new teacher 'Mad-Eye' Moody, part funny, part creepy, all weird...But of course, there is one character in particular everybody's been waiting for since the saga began, one whose presence shouldn't be anything less than hard to forget: Lord Voldemort. And memorable he is, played with smug unpleasantness by Ralph Fiennes. Having previously sunk his teeth in disturbing roles in Schindler's List and Red Dragon, he knows exactly how to make the best of his limited yet precious minutes, endowed with the same unsettling charisma that defined Christopher Lee's Saruman and Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine (shoot, another Star Wars comparison!), with whom he forms what seems to be the trinity of great 21st century screen villains.A perfect entry in one of the biggest franchises ever, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ensures the magic is kept alive, and it leaves David Yates, the director of the fifth movie, with a big challenge: make a film that can live up to this one.9,5/10",9,0,0,10 December 2005
The Happening," Starts well, proceeds well, could have ended better
","The Happening is M. Night Shyamalan's first collaboration with 20th Century Fox (his previous films were financed by Disney) and, probably because of the shift in production company, his first R-rated feature (a bit of an oddity, considering Fox even had Die Hard 4.0 reduced to a PG-13). Does this mean it's a full-blown horror movie? No. It's just as low-key and subtle as The Sixth Sense or Signs - with added blood.The 'happening' of the title refers to a bizarre incident that occurs in Central Park, New York, and then spreads to the rest of the city. Basically, we're talking about some sort of airborne virus (perhaps released by terrorists) that causes sudden inability to speak, disorientation and, finally, an urge to commit suicide. The substance or whatever it is starts invading other states as well, and soon all of the Northern East Coast is contaminated, causing people to run for their lives. One of them is a Science teacher (Mark Wahlberg) who tries to save himself, his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and a colleague (John Leguizamo). As the situation gets more and more unbearable, he comes to realize the 'virus' might be nature reacting to all the bad things mankind has done to the world.Some might say The Happening is a horror version of The Day After Tomorrow, minus the ice, since both flicks seem to warn us about toying too much with nature. It's a good point, but Shyamalan goes beyond aiming for sheer popcorn entertainment: unlike Roland Emmerich's disaster movie, his work is more paced, poetic and thoughtful. He gives his theory time to breathe and reach through to us, while at the same time retaining a sense of mystery, obviously inspired by Hitchcock's decision to not reveal too much in The Birds (in fact, he revealed nothing at all). Perhaps, though, it's best to draw parallels with Spielberg's War of the Worlds, echoes of which are to be found in the tone of the film and Wahlberg's humble 'common man' portrayal, aided by Deschanel. Leguizamo, on the other hand, although a terrific actor when he gets it right (see Land of the Dead), isn't on screen long enough to really make us care for him.And now, what most people argue about in a Shyamalan film: the ending. It's fairly safe to say there's no twist (what was it gonna be? Aliens? Or maybe it was all just a dream?), and that's a good thing because a parable of the fall of humanity wouldn't benefit from that kind of closure. However, considering the awesome build-up (the scene where an infected man gets eaten by lions truly justifies the R), it's a pity to see The Happening end on a syrupy note. At least until the real epilogue is revealed, one that proves, once again, that Shyamalan really has realized the Signs misstep won't be repeated.7,5/10",8,1,5,18 June 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Flawed but compelling epilogue
","Let's get this straight: The Godfather: Part III is not as good as the first two outings, and wasn't really necessary. But then again, neither was Terminator 3, which can't match James Cameron's original cyborg opuses, yet people think it's a good film if considered necessary to know how the whole story ends. It's the same for the third Godfather chapter. On its own, apart from one flaw, it could be a great picture, but compared to its much superior predecessors, it's just an interesting conclusion of the epic Corleone saga.Many years have passed since Part II, and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is getting tired: he decides to hand over the business to his nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), put an end to all illegal activities he's had a hand in, and seek reconciliation with his wife (Diane Keaton), who still fears him for what the mafioso patriarch did to his own brother. In fact, Fredo's death, shown in flashback at the beginning of the film, is probably the main reason Michael wants to retire: he has realized what a terrible man absolute power has turned him into, and he doesn't that to happen to his children. Unfortunately, though, he still has enemies, and they're going to strike pretty hard, maybe through Vincent, who has inherited his dad's quick temper (remember Sonny Corleone?), or Michael's daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), whose friendship with the new boss is blossoming into a passionate, and incestuous, love affair...While the first two Godfathers dealt with power and its effects on people, Part III's main theme is redemption, which is desperately sought for by the aging Michael, a man so repulsed by his own crimes he even confesses his evil deeds to a priest. Al Pacino still makes a believable Corleone, although I have to say I preferred the determined, ambitious, ruthless Michael from the '70s. Nevertheless, his performance is respectable, a thing I can't say of Sofia Coppola. With all due respect, she's an excellent writer and director (Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies), but her acting is very bad, and you notice it even more when she shares the screen with the show-stealing Garcia, who's having the time of his life as the Don's nephew. He's terrific, but his performance alone can't fill the huge charisma hole left open by Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and James Caan. Still, he and Pacino make the third chapter of Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia epic worth a look.So, ultimately, I must say I've seen better franchise conclusions, but I've also seen much, much worse.",8,1,3,16 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Back to school, Mr. Potter: a superior second installment
","Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.So, what about the plot? Well, it's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts, and everything should be fine, given he defeated Voldemort in the previous film and there are no other threats lurking in the magical world. Or are there? A mysterious house elf named Dobby seems to think so, as he repeatedly tries to prevent Harry from returning to school and keeps asking him to leave when students start being attacked by a supernatural, unknown foe. All this seems to be connected to the Chamber of Secrets, but that isn't of much help, especially considering the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, famous writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), is a complete idiot.Darker and faster, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets repeats the Philosopher's Stone's mistake of being slightly too faithful to the literary source, but Columbus manages to compensate this flaw with better visuals, some really creepy set-ups and improved acting from the younger cast members (Emma Watson in particular). He has also made interesting choices when it comes to the new faces in the adult group: Branagh is very, very funny as the ego-fueled Lockhart (a role originally intended for Hugh Grant), but the most interesting addition is Jason Isaacs (whom I can't wait to see again in the fourth film) as Lucius Malfoy, an intriguingly sinister wizard who is as racist and arrogant as his son, Harry's arch-nemesis Draco. As for Dobby, a CG creature voiced by Toby Jones, he is interesting at first but rapidly becomes annoying, his masochistic antics being repetitive and a little dull.Finally, a special mention for Chamber's best element: Richard Harris, who sadly passed away a few weeks before the movie's premiere. He was, and is, incredibly good as headmaster Dumbledore and despite a worthy replacement (Michael Gambon), in the purists' hearts he will always be the one and only greatest wizard of all time.Verdict: good, but they could have done better. Thankfully, they did with number three...",8,36,53,20 November 2005
The Departed," Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!
","He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these 'godfathers' is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...",10,193,303,31 October 2006
Die Hard," Action movies don't come much better than this
","It's been nineteen years since Die Hard was first released, and after three films (with a fourth coming out in a couple of weeks) and countless spoofs or rip-offs, John McClane (Bruce Willis) and his catchphrase ('Yippee-ki-yay, motherf**ker!') have lost none of their charm. Why? Probably because when the first movie showed up in 1988, McClane stood out as a normal guy, as opposed to the various Rambos and Terminators that kept invading the screens. He was an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation (think Jack Bauer's elder brother), and that's what's helped cement his status as one of the most enduring action heroes of all time.The franchise-opener (and arguably the best of the three) sees Willis' police officer trapped in a huge building (the Nakatomi Towers) where his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and several other people are being held hostage by German criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his team. The situation looks hopeless, unless someone decides to take down the terrorists one by one. And given the lack of more suitable 'heroes', it seems like McClane will have to do it.The character's popularity is indelibly linked to his vulnerability: unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger, who walked out of their movies with no scratches and a pack of dead bodies behind them, Willis leaves the scene bruised and battered (in one installment, he even gets to say: 'It looks so easy in the movies!'), even though the body count remains very high. Another thing that sets him apart from his predecessors is his verbosity: whereas Arnie and Sly killed without as much as whispering, McClane keeps on talking, using quick wit and effective curses to comment on his bad situation. This spawns some of the funniest dialogue ever heard in an action movie, such as when the protagonist offs a bad guy from under a table ('Next time you have a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate' 'Thanks for the advice') or tries to contact the police ('Attention, whoever you are. This channel is reserved for emergency calls only...' 'No f**king sh*t, lady! Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?'), and also provides the opportunity for some unseen hero/villain interaction, as Gruber (played by a spot-on Rickman) fakes an American accent and tries to con McClane, only to realize his opponent is no fool and the two start chatting about their conflicting moral values or views on American culture (Gruber: 'This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly' McClane: 'That was Gary Cooper, a**hole!').Also essential in securing this film's success is the claustrophobic setting: while most films tend to drag their characters from one place to another, Die Hard works because the action takes place in one location for the entire running time (an element that was borrowed from Greek drama), adding plenty to the suspense and creative solutions the leading man has to come up with to survive the day.Back in the '80s, this film was great because Bruce Willis was the anti-Rambo. Now, in the age of Neo, Spider-Man and Harry Potter, it seems only fitting that cinemas will be graced with the return of John McClane, a normal dude against the superhuman majority. Time to dust off the T-shirt, get a gun and be prepared to pronounce that immortal line once again.",9,2,3,12 June 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bigger, louder, not necessarily better
","Prior to Transformers (and, to a certain degree, The Island), Michael Bay seemed destined to be remembered as the director of a string of mindless, loud, critically lambasted blockbusters, plus Pearl Harbor (which was all of the above, only a lot more). Now, he's announced he won't direct the already announced Transformers 3, preferring to focus on smaller projects, and so he leaves the franchise with a sequel that looks scarily similar to his previous movies: dumb, excessive and (at least in the US) despised by critics. Sure, it is all of those things, but there's a big difference between Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and, say, Armageddon: this time, the good parts manage to largely outweigh the missteps.Plot-wise, the Kurtzman-Orci duo (aided by Transformers expert Ehren Kruger) aims to set up a complex mythology, as is to be expected with action and sci-fi sequels nowadays: the Fallen mentioned in the title isn't just an adjective related to the defeated Decepticons, it's also the name of a god-like Transformer (voiced by Tony 'Candyman' Todd) who's up to no good and has been around for a long time. At about the same time as he decides to make his move, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is about to start college and trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela (Megan Fox) alive, but realizes the war between Autobots and Decepticons isn't over as far as he's concerned when he starts having spooky visions that could be of interest for the Fallen and the newly resurrected Megatron (Hugo Weaving). And so it's time for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), Bumblebee, Ironhide and the other 'bots to help save the world. Again.The first Transformers succeeded because it displayed a foolproof mix of action and humor, barring the final battle which was a bit OTT. It was a silly movie that was perfectly aware of its own silliness and turned that characteristic into an asset. And for about 90 minutes, it seems like Bay and the writers got that balance right the second time as well: one moment Optimus and Megatron kick the mechanical crap out of each other, the next Sam is trying to make sure his parents don't embarrass him or goofing around with John Turturro's disgraced - and shamefully underused - CIA agent ('What you're about to see is classified. Do not tell my mother.'). The laughs don't just come from the spot-on humans (Rainn Wilson's cameo is a blast), they come from the robots as well, as new entry Jetfire (Mark Ryan) eloquently (more or less) proves.Then, all of a sudden, Bay drops the restraint in the third act: buildings blow up incessantly, slow-motion, smoke and dust are overused, the big Transformer battle goes on for ever and EVER, the mythology leaves room for every cliché in the manual and the silliness is blown way out of proportion (a close-up of a Decepticon's 'privates'? Really?). One might also wonder why the director bothered casting the animated series' original voice cast for the new robots (Ravage, Devastator, etc) when said machines are hastily introduced and then swiftly disposed (speaking of which, why come up with a Decepticon that looks human and drop the subplot after five minutes?).And yet... and yet Revenge of the Fallen is a pretty decent piece of entertainment. Yes, it's loud and dumb in all the wrong ways past the 90-minute mark, and yes, Bay is obviously pandering to a certain audience's expectations by inserting clearly gratuitous slow-mo shots of Megan Fox running in a quite revealing outfit, but what the hell, he does all that with much more gusto, energy and willingness to amuse than he did in Pearl Harbor. If this truly is his last big movie (for the time being, at least), it is, in its own, weird way, a triumph.",7,2,6,27 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Spielberg's Bad ETs
","Steven Spielberg has always been known for his optimistic sci-fi flicks, such as Close Encounters and E.T., where nice aliens befriend humans and develop very special connections. In War of the Worlds, there's no such thing: this time, mankind has to run for its survival, as they're followed by tripods ready to incinerate them. It's like Mars Attacks!, only a lot more serious and much, much darker.At the center of the story is Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a single dad who's trying to be friends with his kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin). Too bad Earth is being attacked at the same time, which means he has to postpone the 'I love you, guys' speeches and go for a more traditional, but efficient, 'Let's get the hell outta here!'. It's all a long escape, with visual references to other Spielberg movies like Jaws, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan.War of the Worlds is unusually dark to come from the director of Indiana Jones, and it's certainly his scariest opus since a certain water-related shocker from 1975. Like Alfred Hitchcock did with The Birds, Spielberg refuses to explain why the ETs are invading our planet. It's our reaction to that apparently pointless event and our excessive fear (the 9/11 parallels are quite obvious) that interests him. Okay, so not telling us why the war is about to begin is a wise choice when it comes to adding suspense, but it also leads to a serious plot hole towards the end of the movie, albeit one you might not notice immediately because of Spielberg's ability to keep you amazed the whole time.Alongside the dread, another remarkable thing about War of the Worlds is the performances that two actors give: Fanning is the usual child wonder, Chatwin and Miranda Otto (who plays Ray's ex-wife) are OK and Tim Robbins is perfectly creepy and creepily perfect as the paranoid Ogilvy, who appears briefly halfway through the film. But it's Tom Cruise who deserves more attention for his very convincing portrayal of a Normal Guy: Ray Ferrier is probably as far from Ethan Hunt as he will ever get.So, apart from a few weaknesses in the plot, War of the Worlds is a riveting blockbuster, another great Spielberg/Cruise collaboration after the superb Minority Report. Rumor has it they're planning to make a couple of other movies together (a Western would be one of the options). If they're gonna be as good as the two they've already done, it looks like a very promising cinematic future.",8,1,2,27 January 2006
Love Actually," Very good, actually...
","If you want a good romantic comedy, you can always count on Richard Curtis. Having written Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones'Diary (and sequel), he's the man responsible for Love Actually, which he also directed.The film takes place a few weeks before Christmas, and tells the stories of people looking for love. Among these we find Hugh Grant's (priceless) Prime Minister, who develops feelings ('Oh no, this is so inappropriate') for his new secretary Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), trying to save her marriage with Harry (Alan Rickman, constantly looking as if he's about to announce you're terminally ill); widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), dealing with his son's love problems; one of Harry's employees (Laura Linney), who's too shy to confess she's in love with a colleague.These characters (and several others) meet throughout the film, with unexpected, hilarious and touching results. As in Four Weddings, Curtis artfully keeps the tone between affecting (the Neeson segment) and gut-burstingly funny (if you don't laugh watching Grant's dance routine, then there's something wrong). All this is largely due to an amazing ensemble cast, comprised of top class thespians from both sides of the Atlantic (Billy Bob Thornton is quite enjoyable as the President of the United States). Standouts include Curtis-regular Grant (the scene where he mocks Margaret Thatcher is comedy gold) and Bill Nighy, who deservedly won a BAFTA award for his portrayal of disgraced (and deliciously sweary) singer and former drug addict Billy Mack. Also notable: Martin Freeman (The Office) playing a porn actor and a cameo by Rowan Atkinson (ace).Overall a funny and well made film, although I must say I could have lived without a couple of episodes (one featuring Colin Firth, the other about a sex-obsessed guy going to America). But if you liked Four Weddings, Notting Hill and the rest, chances you'll like this too are very big.As Billy Mack says, love is all around...",8,0,2,19 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," Wilson + Vaughn = Unmissable (well, most of the time)
","After playing second fiddle to Ben Stiller in Zoolander, Starsky & Hutch and Dodgeball, Vince Vaughn (who also had a supporting role in Old School, which starred Luke Wilson) and Owen Wilson (Luke's brother) finally get to carry their own Frat Pack movie, and the results aren't as sharp as when Stiller's involved. Why? Probably because Wedding Crashers is a romantic comedy - albeit of the weird kind - and therefore things tend to get messy from a strictly narrative standpoint, especially in the third act.The story is about two divorce mediators, John Beckwith (Wilson) and Jeremy Grey (Vaughn), who spend their free time going to as many weddings as possible (uninvited, of course, otherwise it would be no fun), so they can drink free booze and seduce as many hot chicks as possible. Things get complicated at the latest wedding, when John falls in love with the Treasury Secretary's (Christopher Walken) daughter (the simply wonderful Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy ends up with her sister Gloria(Isla Fisher, hilarious). From there on, hell breaks loose, be it in the form of hunting trips, kinky nighttime sex games or horny middle-aged mothers (that would be Jane Seymour).The real heart of Wedding Crashers is Wilson and Vaughn: one provides the sweet stuff (though not in a sickly way) thanks to good chemistry with McAdams, the other goes straight for the belly-laughs and scores gloriously, most memorably in the already classic family dinner scene. From the very beginning, when an Animal House-like montage shows their MO, it's clear their very real friendship is the main reason to see the movie, which manages to be one of the funniest films of 2005 for about 50 minutes.What happens then? Well, the script runs out of energy when it has to tie everything up, and so we get dull subplots and a Will Ferrell cameo which, while fun, was clearly added because there was nothing else to do. Hell, even Christopher Walken appears to be clueless in the final act. Fortunately, the ending doesn't get too sloppy thanks to, you guessed it, Vaughn and Wilson. Next time, though, a little more care during the writing process wouldn't hurt.",7,0,2,10 September 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Forest Whitaker's crowning achievement!
","For years, Forest Whitaker has been a brilliant supporting player in acclaimed films like Platoon or The Crying Game. Now, like Philip Seymour Hoffman did with Capote, he has proved he has the right qualities to carry an entire picture. Okay, so this isn't his first leading role (he also has the underrated Bird and Ghost Dog on his resumè), but there's very little doubt The Last King of Scotland is the movie most people will remember him for.Deftly mixing facts and fiction, Kevin Macdonald's powerful opus covers one of the darkest (forgive the expression) periods in Africa's history. It's 1970, and young Scot Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy, last seen playing a faun in The Chronicles of Narnia) has just graduated from med-school. Of all places, he chooses to go to Uganda, hoping to be able to really help people and, while he's at it, have some fun too. By the end of the opening credits, he's already seduced a woman traveling on the same bus as he, and spends the next ten minutes wooing his employer's wife (Gillian Anderson). It doesn't take long, however, before the situation changes radically: the newly appointed Ugandan president Idi Amin (Whitaker) comes to visit the village where Garrigan works and, fascinated by his methods and origin, offers him a new job. Although a little hesitant at first, Garrigan accepts, thinking his position as Amin's personal doctor might make things easier. Soon enough, though, he will be forced to realize he's actually working for a cruel, if charismatic, dictator, and that there may be no turning back.Rather than delivering a conventional biopic, former documentarian Macdonald prefers to explore the complex and terrifying figure of Amin through his relationship with a completely fictional character, the young, ambitious and excessively naive Garrigan. In fact, although the title (which is explained in a quite amusing scene) refers to the Ugandan tyrant, the movie's real protagonist is the Scottish doctor, in terms of screen-time and character development (hence the weirdness of the screenwriters'decision to drop an interesting subplot almost immediately). And while McAvoy is far from bad, he can't match the towering performance his co-star gives: tackling the most difficult role of his career, Whitaker effortlessly conveys Amin's passion and childlike enthusiasm, making the character charming even when he starts showing his more monstrous aspects (cannibalism not included, the accusations being merely hinted at), as two particularly disturbing scenes towards the end of the film testify.Overall, an incredibly good film. Macdonald deserves credit for brilliantly pointing out that dictatorships don't necessarily belong to the past, but in the end what makes The Last King of Scotland special is the riveting Whitaker. His portrayal of an evil and, at the same time, intriguing ruler is his most layered and rewarding performance so far, of the kind Oscars were created for, and this year's Best Actor statuette undeniably belongs to him.",8,1,3,25 February 2007
Scream 2," Still fun, but less clever than the original
","How do you make a sequel to a horror film whose whole plot was made of in-jokes and film references? Easy: make the follow-up even more in-jokey and self-referential than its predecessor. This formula actually seems to work for Scream 2, at least in the first two acts.The prologue is arguably a masterclass in self-irony: an African-American couple (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett Smith) go to a movie theater where a new horror film, called Stab, is screening. This flick is based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book The Woodsboro Murders, which recounts the events of the first Scream. As the movie begins, Smith's character complains about Stab being a film 'with no black people in it' (just like Scream was), and, predictably, this leads to the two African-Americans being brutally murdered as the film-within-a-film's prologue (with Heather Graham replacing Drew Barrymore) is shown on the screen, so that the fictional and real deaths occur almost simultaneously. From there on, things take the usual turn: the media go crazy about the killings and once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in the spotlight, as she and her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must protect themselves from the new foe, who is apparently mimicking what happened in the past (an obvious reference to the first film's 'Movies don't create psychos' line).The main charm of the original Scream was its ability to almost seamlessly combine clever in-jokes and a believable plot. This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather: Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film.",7,20,31,14 April 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Could have been better, but still an enjoyable entry in the Die Hard series
","John McTiernan, the director of the first Die Hard movie, was unable to film the sequel due to scheduling conflicts with The Hunt for Red October, but came back to do number three, which follows the Hollywood tradition of being bigger, louder and more ambitious than the previous installments. Alas, this doesn't mean it's necessarily better, in fact Die Hard: With a Vengeance is weaker than the first two films in the series, although it remains a watchable piece of violent, profane entertainment.Unlike other threequels, the new Die Hard has almost no connection with the films that precede it: apart from John McClane (Bruce Willis), not a single character from the first or second movie is still around. And McClane's situation is not one of the best: he's got a drinking problem, is separated from his wife and has been suspended from the NYPD. However, when a man named Simon (Jeremy Irons) starts bombing certain areas of New York, he demands explicitly that only McClane be allowed to try stopping him. Why? Because Simon happens to be the brother of Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the German terrorist our hero threw off the Nakatomi Towers in the first film. With this comforting knowledge, the former cop, along with reluctant helper Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), sets out to solve the various riddles his opponent has left around in the city. One mistake, and many lives will be lost. Or is that so?Not only is Die Hard: With a Vengeance larger in scope (the action takes place in an entire city, as opposed to just one building or an airport), the writers also try to make it more complex (the first two movies were rather straightforward) by suggesting Simon's primary objective may not be what it seems. This provides a few neat twists throughout the movie, and they are quite good. Unfortunately, the villain himself turns out to be the weakest link in the movie: instead of making the character his own, Irons prefers to merely imitate Rickman, turning Simon Gruber into a pale reminder of what an intriguing opponent his brother was. There are problems with the so-called 'money shots' (action and sex) as well: some of the set-pieces, no matter how spectacular, look too contrived to fit in the Die Hard universe, and there's a sex scene involving Irons and a female villain that is completely gratuitous and unnecessary (by the director's own admission, it was included just because the film was going to get an R-rating anyway, and it shows).On the flip-side, what is nailed right from the beginning is the chemistry between Willis and Jackson: after appearing in separate sections of Pulp Fiction, the two are finally allowed to share the screen, something they take advantage of to the maximum, delivering a double act that's funny enough to rival anything Mel Gibson and Danny Glover did on Lethal Weapon (the best bit being probably Jackson's reaction when Willis explains the situation to him: 'You mean to tell me that I'm caught up in all this sh*t because some white cop threw some white a**hole's brother off a roof?').Final verdict: as uneven as it may be, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise, and by the time McClane pronounces his trademark line (one of the most quotable in cinema history) even the most skeptical are likely to start cheering.",7,0,0,13 June 2007
The Wrestler," Mickey Balboa
","Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is, alongside Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, the most surprising English-language filmic achievement of 2008: shot on a below-average budget (so low the film's leading man wasn't paid at all), completed just two days before its premiere at a prestigious film festival (Venice) where Aronofsky had been torn apart by most critics two years earlier (thanks to the misunderstood and underrated The Fountain), it went on to win the Golden Lion (and cause a bit of a controversy among the jury members since festival regulations prevented from giving Mickey Rourke the Best Actor award as well) and become a critical darling. And there's good reason for that: despite all the violence and overall sadness, The Wrestler is a celebration of the underdog that even puts the more than respectable Rocky to shame. It's also, to date, Aronofsky's best film.The story is a very classic and simple one: the protagonist, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is a washed-up wrestling champion (the film opens with newspapers and voice-overs commenting on his triumphs, then cuts to him sitting on a chair and reveals those victories are actually twenty years old). He manages to barely get to the end of the month (he lives in a trailer park owned by one Lenny, portrayed by Aronofsky regular Mark Margolis) by working at a supermarket in his native New Jersey and occasionally participating in a few celebratory matches for the sake of nostalgia. Obviously, this isn't enough, and after an almost fatal heart attack he decides it's time to re-evaluate his friendship with stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) and get back in touch with his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). However, old habits die hard, and when he's asked to to fight his old opponent Ayatollah to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of his biggest triumph, he will have to make a tough choice.After a trilogy of sorts that encouraged visual and thematic weirdness (Pi, Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain), it's refreshing to see Aronofsky deal with a traditional story (then again, he didn't write the script). He does, however, pay homage to his first feature by returning to Pi's gritty, hand-held, in-your-face approach: there are lots of scenes where the camera just follows Randy as if we were watching a documentary (or a Gus Van Sant movie), and the energy and violence that are conveyed in the fight scenes (which aren't so 'fake' as professional wrestling is usually described) feel real and visceral. This 'raw' style is most likely a sign of the director's feelings for the project: he really wanted to do it, and shot it fast and cheap because he knew you don't necessarily need Harvey Weinstein's backing - which is good for Oscar campaigning and little else - in order to shell out a masterpiece. The Wrestler is a textbook case of passion project: it comes from the heart, not the money-driven mind.And if that isn't enough, there's one more thing to consider: Aronofsky deliberately turned down a bigger budget because that would have prevented him from casting Mickey Rourke. He's always had a good hand with actors, and the heartfelt performances given by Tomei (rightfully nominated for an Oscar) and Wood prove this beyond any doubt, but miscasting the leading role would have meant destroying the picture's artistic credibility. Fortunately, Rourke was as passionate about the project as his director, and truly delivers the effort of a lifetime. To say the part was tailor-made for him is an under statement: Rourke's tears, sweat and blood (he really injured himself most of the time, including the famous stunt with the razor blade) are the actor's redemption for all past troubles and poor choices, both in his career and his life. Sin City proved he still had talent, but this is the real comeback for someone most people thought was unable to return to, let alone surpass, former heights. That the producers even considered casting Nicolas Cage as Randy sounds like a sick joke more than anything else: this is Rourke's long-awaited moment in the spotlight, and when he says 'This is where I belong', it is impossible not to cheer for him. And that is what truly makes The Wrestler a masterwork.",10,0,1,20 February 2009
Hancock," It's a bird! It's a plane! Nope, it's a hungover Fresh Prince!
","The summer of 2008 wasn't exactly superhero-free: we had The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk and, on a lighter side, Iron Man. Even lighter was Hancock, the least accomplished, but certainly most entertaining blockbuster that came by in that period.Basic idea: Hancock (Will Smith) is a flawed vigilante. So far, nothing new: the whole philosophy of Marvel Comics' production has always been 'superheroes with super-problems', and Superman and Batman ain't that perfect either, especially on film. The twist? Hancock's case is rather extreme - he has a drinking problem, which causes him to cause more damage than good. Okay, so Tony Stark also has a soft spot for the odd cocktail or two (hopefully, that aspect will be analyzed in Iron Man 2, as promised by Jon Favreau), but even he wouldn't greet a bunch of criminals he's about to arrest like this: 'Your head is going up his ass, his head is going up his ass, and you get the short end of the straw, 'cause your head is going up my ass!'. Is it really that surprising that Joe Public's nickname for the guy is 'a**hole'? Didn't think so.Lucky then for Hancock that Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy, is interested in cleaning up his reputation, much to the dismay of Mrs. Embrey (Charlize Theron). This consists of sending the dude to prison for some time, so that he can sober up and understand what is expected from him. Once he gets out, he can become the real protector America needs, which is a good thing considering trouble is waiting around the corner...This isn't the first time director Peter Berg has handled action and comedy at the same time: he previously helmed Welcome to the Jungle, starring The Rock and, uh, Seann William Scott (plus Christopher Walken), and landed an acting gig (along with Bateman, coincidentally) in the misdelivered Smokin' Aces (where the humor was the wrong kind of black). In this case, he benefits from a witty script co-written by Vince Gilligan, whose knack for weird comedy is well known to anyone who's seen The X-Files (among other things, he wrote an episode where David Duchovny switched bodies with, wait for it, Michael McKean). The 'hero gone bad' premise is managed deftly, and as long as the focus stays on Hancock's troubled nature the film remains right on track. Too bad the screenplay calls for an uninvited twist halfway through the story which leads to a sudden shift in tone that can't be shaken off, no matter how hard Berg tries. It's as if two different scripts had been glued together and separated by the 45-minute mark.However, the result isn't as sloppy as one could expect, courtesy of one of Berg's major qualities - his ability as an actors' director (quite easy, since he's an actor himself). Even Bateman and Theron, who are supposedly stuck in boring supporting roles, give truly charming and funny performances (now, who said Theron can't do comedy?). As for Smith, his drunken wise-ass act is arguably his most purely entertaining effort since Men in Black (the first one, obviously), and surely the only reason a sequel has been announced. Not that it's necessarily a bad idea: just get him off the wagon again and we'll eagerly await his return.",7,1,2,6 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A perfect ending/beginning
","When I saw the first trailer,I thought 'This is gonna be good'.When I read that Steven Spielberg started crying during an advance screening and that an Italian critic who had seen the movie in Cannes considered it the best episode of all six,I was even more determined to see it as soon as possible.I went to watch it in Como with a couple of friends,and it was TOTALLY worth it!First of all,ROTS contains nothing of what made TPM and AOTC as watchable as the Matrix-sequels.There are no midi-chlorians,no embarrassing 'I love you,PadmÃ©'-speeches,no ridiculous villains and,most of all,no Jar Jar Binks(actually,he does show up for a couple of seconds,but his appearance is so brief that people shouldn't notice or care). After all, this is the one where darkness and evil are unleashed in all their glory, as we finally learn how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader.Second,although I already knew how the film was gonna end,the story was so touching and intriguing I had to watch the entire movie,and what a MOVIE!!! It' s so heartbreaking,I feel sorry for Darth Vader(the 'I am your father'scene will never be the same again),which doesn't mean he isn't one of the greatest movie villains ever. George Lucas tells a real story this time,knowing that he has to fill several plot holes between the two trilogies.-SPOILER WARNING-He fills 99% of them,and not just essential holes,he also gives us an interesting hint about Palpatine's past,and we also find out why he's so ugly in the original trilogy-END OF SPOILER WARNING-.And finally,the actors. The one who deserves an Oscar-nomination is Ian McDiarmid,his Palpatine/Darth Sidious being so deliciously evil and such a great pleasure to watch. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor are great too,making the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin one of the best on-screen friendships in history. The rest of the cast (Sam Jackson,Natalie Portman,Frank Oz,Christopher Lee)is as good and enjoyable as always.So,if you're a die-hard Star Wars-fan,watch this movie. If you like SF,watch this movie. If you like REALLY good films,watch this movie. You won't regret it.",10,6,13,8 August 2005
Inception," Christopher Nolan's Vision
","Few careers are as remarkably unique as Christopher Nolan's: in only 12 years he's moved from the likes of Following, his debut feature which was shot during weekends for over a year, to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, movies that transcend their 'genre' roots and become great pieces of drama and cinema, conquering critics, awards and audiences (a billion dollars and counting for The Dark Knight). And in between these bigger projects, there are smart, compelling works like Memento and The Prestige, expert lessons in storytelling and filmmaking that, on some levels, are as much about Nolan himself as they are about the characters populating those fictional universes. And then there's Inception, a rarity among summer blockbusters in that it has a considerable budget (close to 200 million dollars), but also an intelligent, layered script which demands attention from the viewer (though not quite to the same degree as, say, The Matrix). It is also, arguably up to this point, Nolan's magnum opus.Given the director's secretive attitude throughout production, the less said about the plot, the better, apart from some basic information: The main character, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who specializes in stealing elements from other people's dreams, thanks to a technique he has perfected over the years and a team of accomplices (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy, among others). He's also haunted by visions of his dead wife (Marion Cotillard) and some dark secrets that prevent him from going back home. Then one day he is asked to do the opposite of his standard MO: this time, he has to plant an idea into the subject's mind. No longer extraction, but inception...From the start, it is clear that Inception is far from the average sci-fi thriller: the opening act alone is a masterclass in narrative deception, thanks in no small part to Nolan's decision to avoid any visual gimmicks - color or format shifts - to separate the real world from the dream-scape. The truth is in the most minute details, and spotting them isn't easy. If The Prestige was a not-so-subtle metaphor for Nolan's filmmaking (the structure of the magic trick mirrored his handling of the plot), the concept is taken even further in Inception, where the maze (i.e. the layout of the dream) constructed by Page's Ariadne (a highly symbolic name, taken from Greek mythology), reflects the director's visual storytelling, with a masterful use of inter-cuts and music to guide us through his own cinematic labyrinth.At the same time, the film also has to deliver on the action level, and it truly does: this is equal parts Memento (each scene clarifies or even contradicts the previous one) and Batman Begins (a fact that is slyly referenced in the casting of Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine), with explosions, chases and shootouts that complete the story rather than being autonomous bits of film. From an impressive hotel set-piece that bears comparison with The Matrix (the big difference being that Nolan uses CGI as sparingly as possible) to the magnificent shot of a street defying the laws of physics, everything serves the story and its dream-like scope (the real reason Nolan waited almost a decade to actually make a film). As for the movie's human center, a necessary element to make the whole thing work on an emotional level, the doomed romance between Cobb (a superb DiCaprio who just keeps getting better) and his wife (kudos to Cotillard for giving such soul to a character that isn't, strictly speaking, real), is the summation of the director's filmography, from Memento to The Dark Knight via The Prestige: amidst all the spectacle and philosophy, it's the people that matter.Inception is with no doubt one of the year's - heck, even the decade's - best films, complex but also hugely exciting and rewarding, a piece of work that stimulates eyes, brain and heart and also embodies the essence of Stanley Kubrick's famed view on cinema: watching a movie is like dreaming.",10,2,10,24 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A detective story in blockbuster format
","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once famously killed off Sherlock Holmes, only to revive him when the public reacted unfavorably. If he were alive today, he'd probably come to the conclusion that he made the right choice, since the medium of film has truly made sure the great detective will never die: from Basil Rathbone to Billy Wilder via Disney's The Great Mouse Detective to TV's Dr. Gregory House, there's a version of Holmes for all ages and tastes. And now he gets the Hollywood treatment again, albeit with a British director, one Guy Ritchie.Rather than adapting a specific story, the film goes in its own direction: Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) has just solved a series of grisly murders, but is unhappy because his loyal assistant Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is moving out of their apartment on Baker Street to live with his fiancée Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Soon enough, though, he has more important things to worry about: his former adversary/lover Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is back in London, and a new chain of macabre events, linked to the alleged resurrection of criminal mastermind Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), requires his full attention, especially as the fact seem to go against his belief that everything has a rational explanation.The announcement that Ritchie, the man behind Snatch and RocknRolla, was going to direct Sherlock Holmes was met with some preoccupation due to his fast-paced, 'hip' style which many see as the polar opposite of the traditional Holmes story. Additionally, the fact that five writers worked on the script caused some extra anxiety. As it turns out, there was no need to worry on either front: the screenplay has enough smarts and wit to satisfy Conan Doyle purists, while Ritchie's 'action' take on the character, which is vaguely rooted in the books (Holmes has been described as a decent amateur boxer), never distracts too much from the mystery, the humor - Holmes' occasional mockery of the police makes for some hilarious conversations with Eddie Marsan's Inspector Lestrade - or the flawless reconstruction of Victorian England (although he could have avoided the use of slow-motion in the fight scenes).Cast-wise, the two leads are perfect: Downey, no stranger to quirky roles, nails the detective's accent, sarcasm and brilliance with relish (the script also allows for a subtle reference to Holmes' cocaine addiction), while Law counterbalances it with a more serious but charismatic Watson, getting as far away as possible from the chubby buffoon seen in previous incarnations. Strong, always among the best things in any movie where he appears, is an enjoyably sinister antagonist, and McAdams is funny and alluring in equal measure, despite the lack of depth granted to her part (the same goes for Reilly, the other woman in what is otherwise pretty much a 'bloke's movie').All in all, this new, 'youthful' version of Sherlock Holmes gets most of the vital things right: it is a blockbuster at heart, but still packs enough charm and potential to make sure the practically inevitable sequel - whose focus on Professor Moriarty is hinted at numerous times during the film - will be the kind of superior big-screen treatment Holmes craves and deserves.

WALL·E," Another stunning work of art from Pixar
","That Pixar manages to stay at the top in the animation field no matter what is a well known fact. That it improves on its own standards with each new movie is also common knowledge, as well as a bit of a miracle. Still, after a creativity peak like the magnificent Ratatouille, their best movie to this day, what could they possibly do to top that? They came up with their boldest picture ever, a philosophical 'kids' movie' that doesn't quite beat Ratatouille, but still stands out as the grand animated achievement of 2008.With WALL-E, the Pixar guys have made their first science-fiction: the setting is Earth, several centuries from now. The planet has been deemed impossible to live on, and so all of mankind is on an intergalactic cruise where everyone, including the ship's captain (Jeff Garlin) gets to relax all day long. Yeah, okay, but what about good old Earth? Well, an emergency plan was set in motion, with thousands of robots left to clean up our mess. Too bad that after all these years none of those machines actually work anymore. Only one keeps operating: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, aka WALL-E ('voice' provided by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt), a cute little thing that keeps piling up garbage and organizing it in neat little cubes.WALL-E isn't just good at his job, he's also incredibly curious, which is why he occasionally keeps 'weird' objects he finds while on duty (bras, batteries, etc) and stores them in his home, where he spends his days watching Hello, Dolly! and pining after some company. It isn't hard to imagine, then, how happy he gets when another robot, Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (Elissa Knight), lands on the planet. Though initially unresponsive to WALL-E's attentions (she is there on a mission, after all), EVE eventually bonds with the little robot (frankly, what else can you do?) and takes him with her on a journey unlike anything else he's ever experienced.Why is this Pixar's boldest movie? Well, for starters, the first real line of dialogue isn't spoken until 40 minutes into the film, a fact most children might not be fully prepared to embrace. Fortunately, writer/director Andrew Stanton, who gave us the wonderful Finding Nemo, knows exactly how to win everyone over: for one thing, he's got the best Pixar character ever as the lead; for another, those first 40 minutes, which rely more on sound and sight than actual plot, are easily the most beautiful thing ever done in an American animated feature. Such is the breathtaking seductiveness of the future imagined by Stanton and his creative partners.Then there's the blatant ecological subtext: it couldn't have a greener message if Al Gore showed up for a cameo (he already did that in Futurama). That too could be too much for a younger viewer, so how do the filmmakers get around it? Why, the Pixar way, of course: smart writing, great humor, heartfelt romance (bit of a paradox, given we're talking about two robots, but who cares?), clever in-jokes (Sigourney Weaver voicing a computer) and the indispensable John Ratzenberger on vocal duties (this time, he plays a character named... John), all together for a ride few people will be able to forget.WALL-E is part of that rare breed of movie that's unlike anything that's come before it, yet strangely familiar. It's intelligent but not preachy, brave but not extremely so, moving but not schmaltzy. Translation: a must-see sample of cinematic magic, 100% Pixar.",10,3,6,31 December 2008
The Good Shepherd," Suffocated by its own ambition, but not that bad overall
","The obvious inspiration is Scorsese and Coppola: like they masterfully handled the world of organized crime in epic (especially when it comes to the length) films like Casino and The Godfather, Robert De Niro, who won his two Oscars under their direction, aimed to do the same with The Good Shepherd, his long awaited pet project on the early years of the CIA. His ambition is evident in every frame, that's unquestionable; unfortunately, it is that same ambition that ultimately brings down a considerable part of the picture.In pure Marty style, the movie starts with the story close to its end: in 1961, Edward Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of the founding members of the CIA, is made aware of the Bay of Pigs disaster, realizing one of his men must have switched sides. Toss in a couple of explanatory conversations with colleagues John Turturro and Alec Baldwin, and then the narrative begins to jump back and forth, revealing the whole sorry tale: how Wilson originally joined a college organization named Skull And Bones in 1939 and formed a strange bond with a professor (Michael Gambon) who seemed to have Nazi sympathies; his doomed love affair with a deaf girl, Laura, truncated when he impregnated and was forced to marry Margaret 'Clover' Russell (Angelina Jolie); his dealings with Russian and British counterintelligence, which eventually made him the ideal choice for creating a new agency inside the US government.All this is compressed in a 165-minute opus: overlong in most cases, but far too short to tell everything De Niro has on his mind. Much like Scorsese's Gangs of New York, there's a distinct feeling the director intended to cover a larger time-frame than just two decades, but was forced to back down for the sake of accessibility, part of which requires a 'reasonable' length for the theatrical release (the DVD is a rather different matter, as seen in the longer versions of The Lord of the Rings). Sadly, that's not the film's only problem: at almost three hours, one wouldn't expect the makers to make audiences unsure as to whether they can get through the first third of the feature. With continuous time shifts that make Memento look like the most streamlined of flicks, The Good Shepherd doesn't really help its viewers follow the events easily; in fact, it almost alienates them before reverting to some sort of linearity once it's past the one-hour mark.Of course, maybe such an approach suited the subject, as this is meant to be a cold, objective look at what happens behind the scenes of covert operations: aside from one execution in the first act and a harrowing torture sequence in the second, it is all very cerebral, the center of attention being the chain-smoking guys in hats who pull the strings rather than the hit men who carry out the assignments. In that sense, Matt Damon was a good choice for the lead, Sullivan being the perfect chance to deliver an anti-Bourne. And he succeeds admirably: cold and distant, like a real spy, Damon's performance might be perceived by some as static, but is even more effective when put next to Jolie's pointless screaming. Hers is the only miscast role in the film, although Billy Crudup's English accent challenges realism at times. The rest of the supporting cast does a remarkable job, but suffers from the same defect as the plot structure: having the likes of Baldwin, Gambon, Turturro and De Niro himself (in his best acting role since Jackie Brown) in the same movie is always a pleasure, but reducing their presence to a series of cameos that are consistently alternated doesn't do them much justice. I mean, what kind of person would cast Joe Pesci in his first job since Lethal Weapon 4 (which was released in 1998) and then give him only one scene? Surely the old goodfella deserves better, right?So, it is very long, that's a given. The first hour is frustrating to say the least. The ensemble cast isn't exactly used to its full strength. And yet it's hard to fully condemn a stylish, ambitious labor of love like The Good Shepherd: for all its flaws, it is admirable for the tenacity De Niro showed by refusing to abandon the project - hardly your regular Saturday night movie, but worth at least one viewing.",7,1,2,29 April 2008
Scream," Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans
","Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.Take the opening sequence, for example: a young girl (Drew Barrymore) is making popcorn and waiting for her boyfriend when she suddenly receives a phone call. Normally, this would be a huge clichè, only this time the killer decides to play a little game (horror film quiz, naturally) with his victim. In fact, the only reason why he kills her is that she gave the wrong answer to one of his questions (those who haven't seen Friday 13th might want to skip that bit, as it spoils said movie's ending). That scene is both very scary (the murder is quite graphic and disturbing) and at the same time funny (it tests the characters', and the audience's, knowledge of the horror genre), and the rest of the film continues in the same vein: after the first killing, the masked psychopath starts disposing of other teenagers in the town of Woodsboro using the same technique. One of the targets is Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was raped and killed the year before. This implies the killer might be the same, but who could it be? Sidney's distant father? Her mother's lover (Liev Schreiber)? Or some random guy, with no motive at all?Fortunately, it is not the last category: this murderer has a motive and a plausible identity as well. But it isn't the payoff that makes Scream interesting; it's how Craven and Williamson get to it, by outlining the genre's conventions (some of which were actually invented by the director himself) and using them in a clever, if self-referential, way. The point of the movie is, the more you know of this kind of films (pay attention to the rules, stated by geeky film buff Randy), the more chances you have to survive (although you must take into account that the killer has seen the same movies). The in-jokes that would ruin other films are the very cause of Scream's success, with memorable scenes such as the villain mimicking the movie his victims are watching or Craven's unmissable cameo as a janitor wearing Freddy Krueger's outfit (not to mention priceless lines like 'Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative!').In other words, Scream is a smart, effective horror film, which manages to amuse and scare in equal measures. Definitely worth watching, even if the two sequels (especially Scream 3) don't really match the original's intelligence and, forgive the expression, originality.",8,83,97,13 April 2007
Prometheus," In the beginning, there was Alien...
","Prometheus was always going to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you have Ridley Scott returning to the genre (and the franchise) that made his name, and pre-release info - be it trailers or the riveting viral videos hinting at important plot elements - suggested it would be a most welcome return; on the other, the Alien franchise has had a rather difficult life for the best part of two decades, due mainly to the disappointing Alien: Resurrection, which, ironically, killed the official series, and the mediocre Alien vs. Predator films, which tarnished the brand's legacy in much worse ways. In other words, this prequel (which isn't really a prequel) has a tough job to pull off.After a spellbinding prologue, we find ourselves in the year 2093, on the scientific exploration spacecraft Prometheus. The ship is headed to a planetoid called LV-233, based on findings by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who believe the human race was created by an alien species they refer to as Engineers (i.e. the creature Alien fans call the Space Jockey). With funding provided by the presumed dead Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the expedition's goal is to find evidence of the existence of the Engineers. However, problems arise on two fronts: given the Weyland Corporation's involvement, company representative Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and android David (Michael Fassbender) may have a hidden agenda; and the Engineers might not be as peaceful as expected.Originally conceived as a straightforward prequel to Alien, the script of Prometheus was subsequently reworked into a standalone effort that remains set in the same universe. This is the film's smartest idea, as it ditches the usual prequel shortcomings (namely knowing exactly how it's going to end) and establishes its own identity, whilst retaining references to the larger franchise, and Scott's original contribution in particular. It is also, however, the movie's biggest flaw, in that the screenplay, credited to both Jon Spaihts (who wrote the first, more prequel-like draft) and Damon Lindelof (who revised the story and mythology), is an uneven affair. The general plot structure is solid, but occasional snippets of dialogue are cringe-worthy, one scene in particular is dramatically pointless and some characters are underdeveloped. Forgivable in a run-of-the-mill monster movie, perhaps, but less so in a film that downplays the horror angle - the tag-line 'In space, no one can hear you scream' would feel out of place this time around - in favor of bigger ideas and themes.This isn't to say, though, that smarts and scares can't coexist. In fact, Scott, ever the talented visionary, constructs imagery that is both breathtakingly beautiful (the aforementioned prologue, which is among the finest sequences in the director's career) and quite shocking, notably a much talked-about surgery sequence that is every bit as intense (and somewhat disgusting) as one would expect from the original Alien man. Prometheus may look more polished than its predecessors, but that doesn't reduce the film's stark visual impact, which is a suitable complement to the deeper themes at play, combining leftover ideas from the established franchise (the deleterious role of corporations) with a new, bold look at the essence of human nature.Which leads to the movie's greatest achievement: the character of David. A mixture of Pinocchio and Roy Batty, childishly curious and inhumanly lethal at the same time he's a gratifyingly complex and intriguing creation, played to unsettling perfection by Fassbender, who is the standout in the cast. The other performances are a bit hit-and-miss (due to the writing), but equally deserving of mention are the most un-Ripley-like Rapace, the delightfully cold Theron and a remarkable Pearce, whose extended cameo requires him to play a man more than twice his age. In the end, though, the real star of the show is Scott, whose untarnished cinematic eye, enhanced by a clever use of 3D, ensures that the journey will be worthwhile. There are a few bumps (including a final scene that is little more than gratuitous fan-bait), but overall this is a decent rebirth for the Alien saga, laying the ground for what could be an interesting extension of the franchise.",7,69,129,31 May 2012
Halloween," Purely and simply... excellent
","When John Carpenter first came up with the idea for Halloween, he probably didn't have a clue he was creating one of cinema's most indelible genre memories - he just thought it would be fun to make a movie about a serial killer striking on October 31. Then again, he had already made a name for himself with Assault on Precinct 13, and thanks to brilliant editing and camera work, great performances and that unforgettable score (which he wrote himself), even its tainted legacy of seven sequels can't tarnish Halloween's iconic status. In fact, it could easily be the best horror movie ever made.The key to the film's genius is simplicity. This is obvious as early as in the opening shot, a nerve-cracking long take which references Psycho in depicting a gruesome murder without actually showing any blood - and it's all seen from the killer's point of view. The deranged individual in question, one Michael Myers, is subsequently locked up in an asylum, from which he escapes 15 years later (the film is set in its real year of release, 1978) to continue killing. The only one who can claim to even begin to understand him is a psychiatrist named Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who follows Michael all the way back to his hometown, Haddonfield, where a bunch of teenage babysitters, including a certain Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature debut), might as well be celebrating the last Halloween of their lives.A lot of things have been said about this movie: how the killer's mask was actually obtained from a Captain Kirk mask, how Michael's actions might be linked to sex (something Victor Miller admits to having expanded on when he wrote Friday 13th), how Carpenter used character names to reference some of his inspirations, like Rio Bravo (Sheriff Brackett is named after Howard Hawks' frequent writing partner Leigh Brackett) or Psycho (Loomis is the name of one of the victims in that film; in addition, Janet Leigh happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis' mother), yada yada yada. None of that really matters. The important thing is how Carpenter constructed a classic in the most basic way, filming everything on location is just three weeks, using friends and crew-members as extras (his collaborator Nick Castle plays the adult Myers) and instilling an everlasting sense of fear through a cunning use of long takes (that and the fact that Michael's face isn't seen for most of the movie).Also, he obtained something most people wouldn't write home about when it comes to slasher films (a genre that was practically born with Halloween): really good acting. Curtis is impressive playing a role that is so far away from the 'Scream Queen' cliché (which didn't exist at the time, but still...), and Pleasence is so outlandishly creepy (even though he's playing the good guy for a change) it's no surprise to learn Christopher Lee still regrets turning down the part. Of course, his remorse is most likely a reaction to the film as a whole, and that's just another piece of evidence regarding its untouchable status.'One night, HE came home', the tag-line said. That phrase could easily refer to the director as well as the character: Carpenter may not have known it when he first thought of the concept, but his decision to do something cheap (in the good sense of the word) and different from any other horror movie led to the birth of a milestone in the genre's history, arguably the finest of those made by the '70s-'80s 'New Wave' (Carpenter, Romero, Hooper, Craven), an achievement that still hasn't met its match.",10,0,1,9 December 2008
Paths of Glory," Anti-war cinema at its most powerful
","Paths of Glory is one of the two war movies Stanley Kubrick directed throughout a splendid career (the other being Full Metal Jacket). And though at first sight these films may seem very different, they share a vital key theme: the futility of war and the monstrous effects it has on the human psyche.In the case of FMJ, the monstrosity is shown through the actions of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D' Onofrio) and Joker (Matthew Modine), both mentally scarred by the teachings of sadistic Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). In Paths, however, the dreadful actions do not take place on the battlefield, but in a courtroom: it is in that courtroom that three randomly selected French soldiers (the context is WWI) are to be court-martial-ed, the charges being cowardliness and refusal to accomplish the mission assigned to them. What the prosecutors don't know is that the mission in question (attacking the Anthill) would have resulted in a bloodbath on the French side and that Gen. Mireau (George MacReady), who ordered the attack and also insisted on holding the trial, was so disappointed he actually asked one of his men to shoot the retreating soldiers. The only person who seems to understand what is really going on is Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas), and it is his difficult job to convince his superiors of the necessity of the squad's behavior.Anyone who is even vaguely acquainted with Kubrick knows this is not going to be a fairy tale: Paths of Glory is one of the most effective anti-war films ever made because it is not afraid to expose the more rotten aspects of what happens in these situations (and it invites comparison with the M*A*S*H episode where Alan Alda makes a documentary and says :'This is no way to end a movie, I know that, but war is no movie'). The director openly criticizes the very nature of conflict by immediately taking Dax's side, showing that he, unlike Mireau who admires the size of the trenches (one of the most beautiful of Kubrick's many tracking shots) and only wants to be remembered as a great general, is more concerned about bringing his men back home as unharmed as possible, putting glory aside.One scene in particular supports the filmmakers'point more than anything else: the trial. While the prosecutor just wants to have the three soldiers sentenced to death and barely pays attention to them, Dax (played with solemn authority by Douglas) allows them to explain what actually occurred during the attack and uses this to openly express his contempt for what the war has done to everyone around him, depriving them of any reason and consideration for human life. That one powerful and upsetting sequence proves beyond any doubt that any war, no matter how noble it may be in its organizer's intentions, is totally and utterly incapable of bringing any real profit: all that results is hatred and greed.Kubrick directed nine more pictures after this one, and all of them dealt on some level with the frailty of humanity and its inevitable decline. Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket aside, though, none of them, however perfect, resonates with as much anger and relevance as Paths of Glory.",10,5,9,21 July 2007
The Queen," Her Majesty Helen Mirren
","During the opening credits of Stephen Frears' The Queen, as soon as the title appears, Helen Mirren turns and looks straight into the camera. That look, and the sense of confidence it conveys, makes us realize she was the perfect choice for the portrayal of HM Elizabeth II (notably, she also played Elizabeth I in a TV miniseries).Mirren's presence is fundamental to this film, which doesn't recount Elizabeth's entire life (that would have required a picture at least twice as long as Frears'opus), but just one crucial week which saw the monarchy at risk.It starts with Tony Blair's victory at the 1997 elections. The newly appointed PM (Michael Sheen, who previously played the politician in Frears' TV movie The Deal) is sent to meet the Queen, in order to be officially given his new job. Despite his modern attitude ('Call me Tony'), he can't but observe old traditions when facing her. It is undoubted she has the power, as well as the people's trust.Alas, that's not going to last, as one night she's told Princess Diana (seen in archive footage) has been involved in an accident, subsequently followed by her death. The whole nation is struck by grief. Not the Queen, who insists on staying in Balmoral, Scotland (the Royal Family's summer residence) until the fuss has died out. Only it doesn't. Everyone questions her attitude, claiming the 'people's princess', as Blair calls Diana, doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. Even when told 4 people out of 7 think the monarchy should end, she remains adamant about her decision, with the support of her husband (James Cromwell), who comments on the events with the sardonic 'Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think we're mad!'.Given the content of Frears' most known films (The Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters), one might expect him to deliver a critique against either the Queen or the people. Instead, he prefers to show us both sides of the coin, justifying Her Majesty's behavior and everyone else's reaction. Furthermore, despite the subject matter, he envisages The Queen as a comedy, and delivers a film that manages to be funny without making anyone look ridiculous or geeky (even Blair, in spite of some antics, emerges as a real, likable person). The British humor is very dry (it's more The Office than Monty Python), and that's one of this movie's major qualities (if it has a defect, it would be the fact that it's merely 97 minutes long; another half-hour wouldn't have annoyed me).However, The Queen would be nothing without Helen Mirren's towering turn as the English monarch. There is strong support from Cromwell (his remarks on Diana's behavior and his reaction at the announcement of Elton John's presence at the princess's funeral are among the movie's funniest, but also most poignant moments) and the spot-on Sheen, but it's Mirren who gives the film its heart and soul. Chances of her receiving an Oscar nomination ( it would be her third, after The Madness of King George and Gosford Park) are very high, and it would only be fair if she won too, since she truly deserves it. It's not likely we'll see a finer performance this year.",9,1,2,12 October 2006
1408," A return to form for both King and Cusack
","'Stay scared' is a line Mike Enslin (John Cusack) repeats a few times throughout this movie. It doesn't only apply to the people he talks to, but is also a message from director Mikael Håfström to the audience, one it will be hard not to pay attention to: 1408, based on a short story by Stephen King, is one of the scariest films in recent years (even more remarkable if you take into account that it's rated PG-13), and arguably the first good adaptation of the horror master's work since The Green Mile.As is often the case with King, the protagonist is a writer: more precisely, Enslin specializes in finding 'haunted' buildings and spending the night in those places, proving there is no such thing as ghosts or any other supernatural forces. One day he receives a postcard which persuades him to go to a glamorous New York hotel and ask to be given the titular room. The hotel manager, played by Samuel L. Jackson, tries to convince him it is a crazy choice, given 56 people have died in that room over the course of 95 years, and when asked what exactly caused those deaths he sums it up with a short, chilling sentence: 'It's an evil f*cking room.'. Nonetheless, Enslin decides to stay in 1408, believing all the warnings he has received are merely publicity stunts. But once things start appearing and disappearing, the door gets permanently locked and a watch starts counting down from 60 minutes (the time-frame within which every previous guest died), the cynical author begins to believe he might actually have entered a room that embodies pure evil.No one has ever lasted more than one hour in 1408, we are told at the beginning. Ironically, that is also how long it takes before the movie starts showing small signs of weakness, mostly plot-related: as long as he relies on psychological tension and thrills deriving from everyday objects, like Kubrick did with The Shining, Håfström has everything under control; it is when he gets to the third act and needs to come up with a satisfying solution that he slightly disappoints, the surreal mid-film twist being way too far-fetched even for a King story (the creepy epilogue, however, is just about enough to forgive that misstep).Less forgivable is the choice of the supporting actors in what is essentially a one-man show: Jackson, who appears in two scenes, manages to be terrific in the first (see paragraph 2) and border on the ridiculous in the second, while there is no logical explanation for why a fine character actor like Tony Shalhoub accepted to do a 30-second cameo which adds absolutely nothing of value to the film. Only Mary McCormack, playing Mrs. Enslin, is able to partially match the painful intensity that emanates from Cusack.Which brings us to the real reason to watch this movie: having not appeared in anything of relevance since 2003's Runaway Jury (where he still ended up playing second fiddle to Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman), the Grifters star is finally given the chance to really sink his teeth into quality material, and he turns out to be genuinely shocking in his second King-based role (he previously played Gordie Lachance's dead brother in Stand By Me). The most gratifying aspect of his performance is the fact he doesn't show symptoms of mad despair immediately: it worked for Jack Nicholson in The Shining, but that was Nicholson; Cusack, who has always gone for a subtler approach to his roles, lets the panic out gradually, making his crazier antics in the picture's second half more believable. The same goes for the back-story: normally, a character's tragic past is thrown in right away to make the audience feel sorry, although it generally causes the opposite effect; this movie's three screenwriters, on the other hand, unveil the dramatic subplot slowly, bit by bit, so that by the time it is tied to present events it is actually possible to care for the people involved.A great premise, consistent suspense and a mesmerizing central performance: those are three valid reasons why lovers of the horror genre should watch 1408. Dodgy 'twist' toward the end and largely irrelevant secondary cast aside, this film has enough assets to ensure King fans will, to paraphrase Mike Enslin, stay scared.",8,1,3,14 August 2007
Shrek," Fairy tales will never be the same again...
","Four years on, Shrek still is a brilliant, original, charming and very funny animated feature. Subverting the usual fairy tale concepts, it's a milestone in 'adult' animation, thanks to its intelligent plot, awesome characters and great movie references, especially the VERY subtle jokes about Disney films.The movie is a perfect mix of satire, action, comedy and romance that keeps delighting the audience even after the, say, twenty-fifth viewing. A lot of its charm is linked to the politically incorrect story and characters, which are voiced by some amazing people: Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and, most of all, Eddie Murphy are the perfect vocal choices for the titular ogre, princess Fiona and Donkey, who is one of the best sidekicks (not just animated) in movie history, the motormouth animal having the same appeal and comic potential as Aladdin's Genie. This is one of those movies where you can say:'Eddie Murphy is a gas'. And the supporting creatures are incredibly good too: pick any fairy tale character you've heard of, and you'll find it in this movie (or the sequel), only totally different from what you expected (Pinocchio, Robin Hood, the Gingerbread Man, Snow White and the Dwarfs, everyone is included in one way or another and with a completely unexpected Dreamworks update that would make Walt Disney himself blush).Making the classic stories fresh and innovative for the new century (and millennium as well), Shrek demands to be seen by every kid, teenager and adult on the planet.Don't miss any chance to watch it!8,5/10",9,4,6,4 December 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...
","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal'The Cannibal' Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?",10,273,335,22 October 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," The conclusion everyone deserves.
","How do you possibly live up to The Dark Knight? A question that has been asked by many people, not least Christopher Nolan, the man trusted with the unenviable task of following the aforementioned blockbuster with a suitable conclusion for his take on the Batman mythos. A job made even trickier by the fact that, unlike Spider-Man 3 (which was meant to have a follow-up) or X-Men: The Last Stand (which might still get one), The Dark Knight Rises has been described by all the people involved in its making as the final chapter, the definitive end point for Nolan's Bat-saga. So the question remains: how do you live up to The Dark Knight? Answer: you don't. But you still deliver an intelligent, riveting piece of filmmaking that proves to be a worthy epilogue.When we last saw Batman (Christian Bale), he had vanished into the shadows, taking the fall for the death and crimes of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, briefly featured in archive footage). Eight years have passed since that night, and the Caped Crusader has disappeared from Gotham City. Bruce Wayne has similarly withdrawn from public life, convinced there is nothing left that is worth living for, much to the chagrin of Alfred (Michael Caine). That is, until something happens that changes Bruce's dual life: the arrival of Bane (Tom Hardy), a terrorist bent on the destruction of Gotham, who is capable of breaking Batman both physically and spiritually. With a little help from his old allies (Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox) and some new faces (Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake and Anne Hathaway as 'cat burglar' Selina Kyle), the Dark Knight has to return to save his city from annihilation. But what price will he have to pay?The defining characteristic of Nolan's Bat-films has always been the grounded, reality-based look at the different tropes of the superhero genre, and this chapter shows the director at his most ambitious, throwing in overt references to financial crisis and the US government's attitude towards terrorists (complete with a brief scene featuring the President which, thankfully, doesn't slip into Roland Emmerich territory). These themes are perfectly encapsulated in the figure of Bane, an intriguing villain who, despite never reaching the heights of Heath Ledger's Joker, remains a frightening presence and acts as the main connecting tissue to ideas first touched upon in Batman Begins, which provides the jumping point for many of The Dark Knight Rise's most poignant scenes.That said, Nolan's ambition is also the film's biggest flaw: even at an impressive 164 minutes, the film feels too short to squeeze in everything he has to say as he tries to bring the trilogy full circle (cue Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy cameos). This is most obvious in the third act, a rushed, action-packed affair that also suffers from unexpectedly contrived plotting. A given in any other superhero film, it comes as a surprise that Nolan, famous for bending or even breaking narrative conventions (he killed off the hero's love interest halfway through the second movie, for crying out loud), should in this case resort to a more predictable climax, effectively embracing the comic-book roots that the trilogy had, thus far, left in a corner. This also accounts for a couple of fan-baiting twists that may prove amusing to some, irritating to others.Nevertheless, the film's heart is in the right place: after the Joker-centric mayhem of The Dark Knight, the focus in this installment is once again on Bruce Wayne, whose personal journey has been the trilogy's emotional anchor. Bale, who's always been perfect in the role, goes even further this time around with his portrayal of a broken man, touchingly aided by similarly compelling performances by Caine and Oldman. And it's testament to Nolan's skill that, even though some of the new characters inevitably get more attention (Hardy gives Bane the on-screen dignity he was shamefully denied in Batman & Robin, while Hathaway's introductory scene alone would justify a spin-off for her Selina), none of the supporting roles feel like afterthoughts, even when it looks like actors of the caliber of Marion Cotillard and Matthew Modine come off as shortchanged in terms of presence.Darker and more brutal than its predecessors, The Dark Knight Rises still offers a glimmer of hope, and is therefore a fitting epilogue for what is, at this point, the best superhero series put to film. And while the conclusion doesn't exactly live up to what can only be described as sky-high expectations, one should not overlook the fact that this has the guts to actually be THE end. And given the circumstances, it's exactly what we need, and what we deserve.",8,3,8,20 July 2012
Iron Man," Yeah, he can fly!
","With the exception of Elektra, the first Fantastic Four and Blade: Trinity, there hasn't been one Marvel movie that wasn't at least superficially enjoyable (in the case of Spider-Man 3 and The Punisher, that was almost all they had). Given the high credentials of both director (Jon 'Swingers' Favreau, who also acts in the film) and stars (Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges), Iron Man was expected to be one of the superior Marvel flicks, and indeed it is: it doesn't really reach the heights of X2 or Spider-Man 2, but ranks solidly alongside the first installment of either franchise as a great start of what is set to be another crowd-pleasing series.As expected, the first half of the picture is entirely devoted to the origin of the character. No angsty teenagers or alienated aliens (sorry about that), though: unlike Peter Parker or Clark Kent, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is not concerned about anything, except having as good a time as possible. And could you blame him? He is one of the richest men in America, charming enough to bed whichever woman he wants and just so smug that when asked to comment on his nickname 'Merchant of death' (he owns a weapons factory) he retorts: 'That's not bad'. However, things are about to change, as Tony is kidnapped during a business trip in the Middle East and forced to create a missile for a local warlord. Disgusted by the sight of his weapons being used to slaughter innocent people, he decides to find a way to escape, and comes up with a hi-tech armor as a result. Once back in the US, he announces he will no longer produce death machines, and with the help of his secretary (Paltrow) he modifies his suit to make it more effective for his new cause: ensuring peace.All in all, protagonist aside, there is nothing very original in Iron Man: good vs. evil? Yep. Gorgeous female sidekick? Yep. Tons of action juxtaposed with great humor? Yep. Deeper issues? Let's save them for the sequels, shall we? And yet the film works very well, every single minute. Why? Because Favreau never slows down the pace with futile digressions (the few tender moments are essential in establishing character), nor does he make the fun bits overblown (one of the problems in Spider-Man 3): having obviously learned something from the criticisms aimed at Daredevil, in which he had a supporting role, he delivers a blockbuster that is clever yet accessible, as well as tremendously fun and exciting. Considering his comedy CV (he even appeared in Friends), it was practically granted he would nail the lighter scenes, and he does: just check out the ubiquitous Stan Lee, who gets mistaken for Hugh Hefner (yes, you read that right). Even better, Favreau does miracles when it comes to combining laughs and special effects, deserving comparisons with Sam Raimi's work on the Spidey flicks. And the real action? Well, there's the entire third act, a marvelously executed piece of entertainment.The film scores another bunch of points casting-wise: after a series of pretty much unseen roles, Paltrow finally hits it big again with the sweet, helpful Pepper Potts (terrific name), Terrence Howard is a suitable mix of authority and hilarity, and Jeff Bridges is excellent playing the bald, goateed villain. But what really makes a difference in this movie is Iron Man himself, easily listable as one of Downey Jr.'s Top 10 performances. Sure, he is equally great in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Zodiac, but there is a distinct feeling he was born to play Tony Stark, and not just because of his similarly excessive past lifestyle: a lifelong fan of the comic-book, Downey squeezes every drop of humanity he can find out of what could otherwise have been reduced to a playboy caricature and portrays a real person, albeit a (super)heroic one, in pure Marvel fashion.And yet, for all these combined treats, the film falls a bit short of perfect for being, ironically for the genre, too short, even at 126 minutes: the ending comes off as abrupt and somewhat sequel-baiting, though less irritating than the conclusion of The Matrix Reloaded. But hey, if Iron Man 2 means another two hours of Downey Jr. in the red-and-gold suit, bring it on: the first film is one of the most fun cinematic experiences of 2008, and more of the same can only be a good thing, right?",9,1,2,7 May 2008
Blade Runner," This film's moments will never be lost in time, like tears in rain...
","'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.' This frequently quoted line, spoken by the villainous Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), sums up the essence of Blade Runner: it's an incredible experience. Yes, there have been controversies about the film from the day it was released, be it the arguments between director Ridley Scott and the producers over which version should be shown to the public or rumors about the filming being 'troubled', but such gossip shouldn't detract from the picture's merits, and there are plenty; in fact, a lot of people consider Blade Runner the best science-fiction movie ever made, and they do have a point - how many sci-fi flicks manage to fuse film noir atmosphere and characters with philosophical doubts on the very nature of mankind?Specifically, the story, based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, is strongly influenced by the theories of Swiss philosopher René Descartes, aka Carthesius. One of the main concerns of his line of thought was the difference between men and machines, the main theme of the film: in 2019, replicants used to be part of everyday life, but are now dangerous and must be eliminated. Five of these 'skin-jobs', however, are still at large in Los Angeles, which is why reluctant 'blade runner' Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is asked to track them down. But as he gets more and more disillusioned about his work and develops odd feelings for one of the replicants (Sean Young), he begins to wonder: is there really something that sets him apart from the entities he is hunting? Batty and his lover Pris (Daryl Hannah) are trying to answer that question by eliminating the last imperfection that makes them less 'human' (they only live five years), and Pris even claims to be as normal as any other person by saying: 'I think, therefore I am.' (another Carthesius-related element). With his first two films (The Duellists and Alien) accused of being more about style and mood than content, Scott combines form and substance in what is widely regarded as his best achievement: the rainy, gloomy L.A. (all real sets, no CGI) sets the tone perfectly for a futuristic noir that renewed the genre by crafting an intelligent, heartfelt and adult story, making Warner Brothers' decision to chuck in a 'happy ending' (subsequently removed, alongside Deckard's uninspired narration, from the Director's Cut, which is the version I'm reviewing) utterly ridiculous. I mean, how can a movie set in a bleak future where even humanity itself is a debatable topic end on a cheerful note?Speaking of humanity, the film's point is reflected masterfully in the performances: Ford's laconic, apparently cold anti-hero is one of his best characters, and his doomed bond with Young is endearing to this day, but the whole movie is shamelessly stolen by the 'monstrous' Batty, to whom Hauer gives a scary intensity that makes the doubtful replicant more complex and the Dutch actor's work (the best of his career) more touching, particularly when he remembers all the things that he has seen and will inevitably be 'lost in time'.Dark and unsettling, Blade Runner is a beautiful, nightmarish and fascinating journey in a twisted society. No other sci-fi movie can match this one in terms of impact, both visual and emotional, and after seeing it one might ask himself what it must be like to see 'attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion' or 'C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate'.",10,1,2,9 November 2005
Casino Royale," The most exciting action film of 2006, and possibly the best Bond movie ever...
","After the increasingly overblown Pierce Brosnan run (beginning with the great GoldenEye and ending with the shallow, if fun Die Another Day), the 007 franchise needed a shot in the arm to conquer audiences again. Hence the decision to reinvent the series, much like Christopher Nolan did with Batman, by adapting the first ever Bond novel, Casino Royale (already filmed as a hit-and-miss spoof in 1967).As this is our favorite spy's first adventure, he's quite different from the previous characterizations: he hasn't achieved his 00 status yet (something he takes care of in the black and white opening sequence), he doesn't have a specific taste regarding martinis (when asked if he wants his drink shaken or stirred, he replies: 'Do I look like I give a damn?') and he makes mistakes (such as killing an unarmed man and blowing up an embassy - in front of a camera!). Not exactly the kind of employee M (Judi Dench) is that proud of. She does however give him an opportunity to redeem himself by participating in a poker game at the Montenegro Casino Royale. The reason? One of the players is Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a man known for financing terrorists. If he wins, he could walk away with at least 15 million dollars, a sum that can be very dangerous in the wrong hands.The true joy of Casino Royale is the realistic tone: there are no silly gadgets (in fact, Q doesn't appear at all in this movie), no superhuman stunts (well, except for a 20-minute chase scene at the beginning of the film), no sci-fi elements whatsoever. This time around, Bond is not an invulnerable macho guy with spectacular weapons; he actually gets hurt quite often, and reacts pretty brutally, using whatever object he can find. Much has been said about Daniel Craig, mostly offensive remarks concerning his hair, but I actually think he could be the best Bond ever. I know that statement is close to heresy, but here's a fact: all the previous Bond films, even those with Sean Connery, focused more on the character's womanizing than on his violent nature (the exception would be Timothy Dalton's final Bond outing, Licence to Kill, which was perceived as too rough when it was released in 1989). Craig, on the other hand, is a believable assassin, in terms of looks as well as mannerisms (the fact that he's already played his fair share of 'morally flexible' people, as seen in Munich or Infamous, also helps). He's a darker, more interesting Bond, probably the closest an actor's ever come to the true spirit of Ian Fleming's character. Sure, there is romance, as always, but the core of the movie is the fact that Bond is, first and foremost, a killer, much like his modern-day cinematic heir Jason Bourne (an obvious influence in terms of style). That said, the film is far from being a one-man show, the supporting characters proving meatier than usual: Dench is as impeccable as always, and the same ought to be said of Jeffrey Wright, who brings Felix Leiter back to the franchise after a 17-year absence; Mikkelsen is a riveting villain, his charm deriving from the fact that he's not interested in world domination, not to mention every bit as vulnerable as the hero (the poker game is actually his last chance to please his superiors, otherwise he'll die), and Eva Green is the best Bond girl since Diana Rigg. Instead of the usual lame sexual innuendo, the dialogue between 007 and his female partner is sharp and enjoyable ('You're not my type', he tells her; 'Smart?', she replies with a touch of sarcasm; 'Single', deadpans Bond). The performances are probably the main reason Casino Royale is the most emotionally relevant entry in the series since On Her Majesty's Secret Service (Royale's ending is much more satisfying, though): the new Bond is a human hero (or rather antihero), a character the audience can relate to when things go bad, like in the infamous torture sequence, so painful it actually provides a reason to question the PG-13 rating (alongside the opening restroom murder, it also makes the viewer understand why Quentin Tarantino was interested in directing the film).Dark, adult and compelling, Casino Royale is the 007 movie fans have been expecting for ages, and by the time cinema's favorite secret agent finally delivers THAT line, even the most skeptical will have to admit it: Daniel Craig IS James Bond, and that's not going to change for quite a while.",10,0,4,28 December 2006
Trainspotting," Choose life, choose a big television, choose to watch this movie...
","The best British film of the '90s? That's right, Trainspotting is a hilarious, dark, weird and sometimes painful masterpiece. Based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel (Welsh appears as a dealer, by the way), it's one of the most compelling, entertaining and shocking looks at the effect drugs can have on people, and it's to director Danny Boyle's eternal credit that he doesn't depict just one side of the story: we get to see what these people enjoy about getting high, so that we can, if not forgive them, at least understand them.The film takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, home to five youngsters who hang out and cause trouble together. The team's 'moral' leader, not to mention the movie's narrator, is Mark Renton (Ewan Mcgregor, in a career-defining role), who knows he's slowly ruining his life and tries to kick the habit several times. That he'd rather have sex with an underage girl (Kelly MacDonald) than give his decision any serious thought doesn't speak very well on his part. His mates, in sanity order, are Tommy (Kevin McKidd), who's sane enough to stay away from heroin (he shoots DIY sex tapes instead), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a James Bond-obsessed pervert (ironic, since the actor's grandfather, Bernard Lee, played M in the Connery and Moore era), Spud (Ewen Bremner), so lost in an everlasting high he can't speak properly, and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), whose personal drug consists of beating up people, especially when they're not Scottish.What gives the film a bit more edge compared to most dramas about drug addicts is its unrelented, anarchic energy, evident from the beginning, when Renton and Spud are running away from the police, with Iggy Pop's 'Lust For Life' blaring on the soundtrack and the narration imposing itself with the famous 'Choose life' monologue, arguably the best sample of junky philosophy in the entire movie. Boyle never stops for one second, but continues to jump between funny and tragic, real and imaginary, cheeky and serious, using Scorsese-worthy camera angles and movements and state-of-the-art dream sequences to grant us a rare view of the addict's mind and soul.The double aspect is present in the performances as well: Miller and Bremner play it for laughs most of the time, therefore lightening the tone whenever Carlyle's madness or other external events threaten to make the picture too bleak. And then there's McGregor, the one caught in the middle between hilarity and darkness (literally, in the case of the terrifying overdose scene), who tells the story with the right combination of earnestness and irony.Trainspotting isn't a lecture: it shows the 'fun' part of doing drugs (the toilet dive) and the downside of it. It's not Ken Loach, it's Danny Boyle, which means it's one of the coolest, edgiest pictures of the '90s. A masterwork. It's also got the catchiest music of the decade, after Pulp Fiction, that is.",10,4,7,12 September 2005
Signs," Silly ending aside, this is a very good sci-fi thriller
","First came The Sixth Sense, then Unbreakable: two near perfect movies in a row. M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a film that good since, but that does't mean his subsequent works aren't worth watching: they are flawed, but Shyamalan's talent in creating compelling characters and a creepy mood shines throughout all of them.Continuing in the direction of his previous two hits, Shyamalan tells a supernatural story where plot and characters are favored over action. Signs takes place in Pennsylvania, where the widowed farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds crop circles just outside his house. The phenomenon keeps repeating itself night after night, prompting all kinds of speculation: Graham's brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) believe it's the work of God; Graham himself, who used to be a priest but lost his faith after his wife died in a car crash, on the other hand, doesn't know what to think. However, it seems like something is moving in the fields and scaring the animals, suggesting those circles might foreshadow an alien invasion.Just like he didn't deliver a straight horror movie or a traditional comic-book flick, Shyamalan tries to get beyond the conventions of sci-fi, using the alien premise as an excuse to focus on a man's spirituality and his quest for lost faith. The religious subtext may annoy science-fiction purists expecting immediate action, but if all genre films were alike, people would get bored pretty quickly, wouldn't they? Besides, isn't it a bit hypocritical to criticize Shyamalan for making a meditative alien movie and praise Steven Spielberg (one of the director's major influences) for doing something similar with E.T.?Also, spiritual message aside, the trademark suspense is consistently present, meaning that formally speaking Signs isn't that different from the average sci-fi thriller. In addition, the acting is as strong as expected from thespians working with Shyamalan: Gibson, in an unusually understated role, finds the soul of his character with relative ease, partly because his Catholic upbringing suits the film's themes, partly because he's used to playing widowers, as seen in Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Braveheart; Phoenix is equally unpretentious, and the children manage to be sympathetic in a not too cutesy way.Granted, the famously bad-mouthed ending is very weak, even downright stupid if compared to everything that came before it. But that's just the last fifteen minutes: the rest is a classic example of a good story well told.",8,0,4,17 June 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Yo soy Woody Allen
","After three years in England, Woody Allen ends his European vacation (his next feature, starring Seinfeld co-creator Larry David, is set in New York) in Spain, and delivers his freshest, funniest comedy in eleven years (the wonderfully self-deprecating Deconstructing Harry came out in 1997). In reality, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (the title alone borders on genius) contains nothing completely new for an Allen film: love, unhappiness, neurosis, chronic dissatisfaction. But instead of remaking one of his older New York films with younger actors (Anything Else compared to Annie Hall, for example), he uses the new, more romantic setting to breathe fresh air into the age-old story, supported by a fiery cast.As implied by the title, the main characters are Vicky (Rebecca Hall), Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) and the city of Barcelona, where the two spend the summer together. Vicky, the more rational one, is there to work on her university thesis (Catalan lifestyle) and take some time off before her imminent wedding. Cristina, who is more impulsive, came along to have some fun. Through one of Vicky's relatives (Patricia Clarkson, always as good) they meet an up-and-coming painter, Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem), a man who embraces the positive aspects of life despite believing it to be ultimately pointless. In a classic Allen scene, he invites Vicky and Cristina to come with him to Oviedo for a weekend, explaining they will enjoy the sights, the food, the wine and, uh, the lovemaking. At this point, a mildly shocked Vicky asks: 'Excuse me, but who's gonna make love?' Juan Antonio, as serious as a horny Spaniard will ever be, replies: 'Hopefully, all three of us.'Revealing anything else about the unusual threesome is a disservice to Allen's witty script. An exception would be mentioning that halfway through the movie Juan Antonio's psychotic ex- wife, Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz), comes back home, and that's when the real madness ensues and one remembers why they fell in love with Woody's movies in the first place. For years, his modus operandi has been: take a relationship, mess it up, see what happens. Perhaps the fact that he doesn't play the leading role anymore (in fact, like in his best post-2000 film, Match Point, he doesn't appear at all) has encouraged him to try 'crazier' things. In this case, the Spanish setting and the casting of Cruz (whom he wanted to work with at all costs after seeing the beautiful Volver) enable to him to blend his classic 'neurotic love story' with a sort of spoof of the telenovela genre, following the example of the TV show Ugly Betty (which, like most of Allen's work, takes place in the Big Apple). The Spanish actress, matching the feisty intensity she showed in Almodovar's black comedy, is on top form, giving a spontaneous, wild performance that should earn her a second Oscar nomination. Not that her American co-stars are less good: Johansson cements her status as the director's new muse with a vitality that shows how terrific she can be when cast in the right part, while Hall, who is actually British, channels early Diane Keaton (from Woody's golden period) with grace.And what about the male cast? Well, there are only two presences who are prominent enough to rival with the Johansson-Hall-Cruz trio: Bardem and the omniscient narrator. The latter is actually a problem sometimes: it's fine, even entertaining, when he deadpans on events as we see them happen on the screen (especially when he describes an encounter between Cristina and Juan Antonio), less so when he insists on telling us exactly how the characters are feeling. Fortunately, Bardem compensates that occasional lack of charm by exuding loads of it: obviously relishing the opportunity to lighten up his image after his Oscar-winning turn in No Country for Old Men, he replaces that film's icy stare with a smile that could seduce anyone and speaks his lines with a warm earnestness few people wouldn't enjoy.Maybe it's a good thing that Allen's holiday ends here. After all, his London trilogy started superbly and ended on a less encouraging note, therefore it's wise of him to not attempt the same thing with Barcelona and return to America, leaving the misadventures of Vicky and Cristina as an indication that perhaps, hopefully, he has found his way again.",9,5,12,10 October 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Occasionally uneven in pace and seriousness, but interesting and effortlessly carried by Blanchett
","Horror, fantasy and comic-book films tend to have sequels even if the original was bad, as long as box office results were relatively positive. But biopics? Who would actually green-light a second installment of someone's cinematic biography? Even Cate Blanchett was unsure whether to play Queen Elizabeth I again, despite the Oscar nomination she received for the first movie. It took some persuading from director Skekhar Kapur and co-star Geoffrey Rush (the only other returning cast member from the original film) to get her back on board, and even though Elizabeth: The Golden Age isn't nearly as good as the previous chapter, Blanchett confirms she is one of the best actresses ever.Ending the first picture with Elizabeth fully embracing her responsibilities as sovereign of England, The Golden Age shows her struggles to maintain her authority. That isn't easy, as dangers are hidden everywhere: though locked up, the Queen's villainous cousin Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) keeps plotting to claim what she believes to be rightfully hers, and to achieve that she seeks the help of King Philip II of Spain, an overly devout Catholic who sees it as his mission to rid the world of a Protestant 'traitor' like Elizabeth.Things don't fare much better at court either, for the monarch, still unwilling to get married, may have met a man capable of stirring conflicting emotions in her, emotions she deemed lost after her disappointment with the Earl of Leicester in the previous installment. This man is Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a brave and sufficiently cocky 'pirate' who has brought a lot of trouble to Spain's ships. As he troubles Elizabeth too, she leaves him in the hand of her most trusted maid (Abbie Cornish), inadvertently setting in motion a chain of events that could cause a quite unexpected reaction on her behalf: jealousy.Much like he did back in 1998, Kapur delivers a visually perfect feature, with sets and costumes that render the period while keeping the movie from feeling old-fashioned. He also employs the same narrative technique as he did last time, intertwining conspiracy thriller and romantic tragedy, with the addition of a little action in the third act, which sees the British fleet face the Spanish Armada in one of the most riveting naval battles to have been put on screen (it even manages to make Pirates of the Caribbean look lacking in explosions). What precedes that epic showdown, however, is at times frustratingly uneven: certain scenes succumb to a bout of slowness, and certain dialogue exchanges between Blanchett and Owen (appropriately charismatic and 'rude' as the Errol Flynn-like Raleigh) are corny to say the least. But overall the suspense is rather consistent, and the dangerous love triangle at the second act's center manages to get more dramatic as time goes by.All of that, though, is unimportant in assuring the film is watchable. The first Elizabeth's saving grace was the actress playing the main part, and the same happens in this sequel: the mere look on Blanchett's face as she stares at a potential assassin should be enough to give her the Oscar she didn't get in 1999, such powerful is the sense of authority, control and restrained rage she conveys in the continuation of what will remain her crowning achievement (pun not intended). Only Morton, using her three or four scenes to perfection, comes close to stealing the limelight from the protagonist, with a wounded, compelling depiction of dignified defeat.At this point, the only question left is: do we need a third film? Not really, although Kapur intends to make a final installment about Elizabeth's last years. Do we want one? Well, yes, but only if Blanchett accepts to reprise the role. Oh, and returning to the qualitative heights of the original movie wouldn't hurt either.7,5/10",7,1,3,14 January 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Terrific movie, but why the hell is it rated PG-13?
","Of all the action heroes that have appeared on the big screen throughout the years, Die Hard's John McClane still stands out as the most charismatic and likable, thanks to his down-to-earth attitude and reluctance to being defined a 'hero'. These characteristics are retained in the franchise's new installment, Live Free or Die Hard (or Die Hard 4.0, as it is known in Europe), which manages to be fresh and exciting even if it's been 19 years since the series began.The fourth movie shows us a different world from what we were used to: after 9/11, the main fear is not that we will be attacked by foreign terrorists, like the first film's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), but that the enemy might strike from within our own country. And that's exactly what happens: a man named Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and his crew manage to breach the USA's main computer networks, controlling everything from telephone lines and traffic lights to the stock market. If he isn't stopped in time, he can destroy anything in the nation that is run by a computer - which is practically everything. The real bad news, however, is that he has made sure all the people who could put an end to his work are dead. Only one remains: young, nervous hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, the Dodgeball guy who kept getting hit in the... well, you know), who has to get to Washington D.C. alive in order to understand what is going on. And who is is charge of keeping him alive? That's right, it's McClane (Bruce Willis), who would really rather be at home and try to fix his own problems: you see, he's divorced and his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) refuses to talk to him. But there he is once again: in the wrong place at the wrong time, ready to kill some bad guys and save the day.The previous entry in the series, Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995), suffered mainly from being set in the entire New York City area, whereas the unique element of the first two movies was the tension deriving from a single location (the Nakatomi building and an airport respectively). Fortunately, director Len Wiseman (Underworld) knows what fans expect from a Die Hard film and gives them exactly that: although the threat in the film involves the US in their entirety, the script allows Wiseman to stage all the major action scenes in smaller, limited zones (a highway notwithstanding), mirroring the sense of claustrophobia that defined the franchise in its early years.Another thing that has been left unchanged is the McClane character himself: his worsened private life makes him even more reluctant to do this kind of stuff again, but he has to because, as he tells Farrell in one of the movie's most revealing scenes, no one else is willing to do it. The true appeal of the franchise has always been in its unconventional leading man: even though he gets a kick out of blowing up stuff ('Did you see that?' Matt asks him after he has killed one of Gabriel's henchmen; 'Yeah, I saw it, I did it!' he replies ecstatically), he prefers being elsewhere, handling everyday things and putting his life back together. Unlike Rambo or the Terminator (the two characters that ruled the action genre at the time he made his first appearance), McClane is vulnerable, and he gets hurt a lot, which is why people root for him all the time. Willis has a great time reprising his favorite role, and he deserves extra praise for not being afraid of showing that he has aged, becoming a little less skilled at dodging blows from the enemy but nevertheless still determined to go all the way with it (similarly to Danny Glover, who famously kept saying 'I'm too old for this sh*t' in the Lethal Weapon movies).Great support comes from Long, Winstead and Maggie Q, but the real value comes from the villain: having learned from his Deadwood costar Ian McShane, Olyphant ditches the OTT mania that made his Scream 2 character risible and goes for underplayed intensity instead, playing Gabriel as a realistic, unsettling update of Hans Gruber.If there is a problem with the movie, it lies in the rating: a PG-13 is an open contradiction of everything a Die Hard movie stands for, and even if the violence is strong enough to demand an R in places, there is an overall feeling that something is missing.The PG-13 also means that another series trademark, the frequent profanity, is essentially limited to 'sh*t', and the absence of more offensive insults is particularly felt in Kevin Smith's cameo: without the swearing, it's hilarious; with the Clerks director's notorious foul language, it would have been comedy gold. But die-hard fans (pun not intended) needn't worry: the franchise's immortal catchphrase is included, and once Willis delivers it it's confirmed beyond any doubt that John McClane is the best action hero of all time, and it was worth waiting twelve years for his return.Yippee-ki-yay indeed!",7,6,13,28 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," X2: Mutation Moves On
","After the success of the first movie, Bryan Singer brings the X-Men back to the screen. He has stated X2 is the X-version of The Empire Strikes Back. He's not totally wrong: like Empire, X2 is darker than its predecessor, characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way, and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed (there's even a 'I am your father'-style revelation concerning Wolverine's past, which is given more space here than in the first chapter). In fact, the movie could have been named X2: Humanity Strikes Back. That's right, this time it's the 'ordinary' people who are raising hell, in particular William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who takes advantage of the increasing paranoia surrounding mutants and has the POTUS himself approve his plan to take down the 'monsters' once and for all. The war is about to begin, and with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Cyclops (James Marsden) gone, the only X-Men left to face Stryker are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), with some help from Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). They are eventually joined by a former employee of Stryker's, the blue-skinned teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), as well as the most unlikely ally around: Magneto (Ian McKellen), who has managed to escape from the plastic prison he was locked up in (the break-out plays like the Marvel version of Hannibal Lecter's escape in The Silence of the Lambs, and yes, that is a compliment).The plot is loosely based on the famous graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills by X-guru Chris Calremont (the villain and the alliance with Magneto are explicitly taken from that story), but Singer makes it all much more apocalyptic (Stryker was simply a preacher in the comic-book), while also having the time to take a look at some of the first film's subplots: the Wolverine-Jean-Cyclops love triangle is taken to a new, unexpected level and the Canadian mutant's forgotten 'origin' starts getting slowly unveiled (Wolverine: 'Who are you?'; Stryker: 'Don't you remember?'). Jackman is the standout in this movie, as we finally get to see everybody's favorite X-fella lose it and make the bad guys regret they showed up in the first place. Those sequences are a treat for those who have grown up loving Wolverine and his dual, conflicted nature. Another actor who leaves a memorable impression is Cumming with his portrayal of Nightcrawler, one of the mutants people fear the most (he looks like a demon), but also the one who's most willing to forgive mankind for its mistakes.So, with all the great acting, good writing and clever direction, no wonder X2 was voted the greatest comic-book movie ever before Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins were released. This is one superhero opus you won't want to miss.9,5/10",10,15,20,21 December 2005
The Sixth Sense," A clever, gore-free horror thriller
","Though many believe it to be true, The Sixth Sense is not M. Night Shyamalan's directorial debut (in fact, it's his third movie), but that myth holds up well because no one knew about him before this film. Not his proper first, then, but the first significant one, and deservedly so.Influenced by TV shows like Tales of the Unexpected and The Twilight Zone, Shyamalan crafts a slow-burning, low-key thriller that grabs the viewer right from the beginning: psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is enjoying an evening at home with his wife when he's suddenly attacked by a former patient (Donnie Wahlberg). Months after this shocking prologue, Malcolm's marriage is in jeopardy and he needs some kind of redemption for what he believes to be a professional failure. He finds that redemption in the shape of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a young boy with a terrifying psychic gift, best described by the kid himself: 'I see dead people!'.That line has been aped countless times since the movie's release, as has the now legendary twist ending, which has become a Shyamalan trademark. But knowing about the twist, or guessing what it is at an early stage of the viewing, is beside the point: it isn't the ending itself that matters, but the build-up. Consider other famous 'twist' movies, like The Crying Game, Psycho, The Usual Suspects or Fight Club: the revelations at the end or halfway through those features are brilliant, no doubt, but if the overall film is bad it will diminish the epilogue's impact, no matter how smart the latter is.As such, when watching The Sixth Sense, the attention shouldn't go to the climax, but to everything that precedes it: how Shyamalan creates tension with very few camera movements, most of the creeps coming from James Newton Howard's score; how the story evolves slowly and naturally, enabling us to care for the characters and their inner struggles; how the subdued Willis and the creepy Osment constitute one of cinema's best on-screen duos, with able support from Wahlberg, Toni Collette and others (Mischa Barton's cameo is one of the scariest things of the '90s).The trick is in the smaller details, and that's what makes The Sixth Sense an immensely satisfying experience. Instead of gore and monsters, Shyamalan uses psychology and subtle chills to construct a memorably unsettling atmosphere, adding emotion on top. And, of course, the unsurpassed ending.",9,1,2,16 June 2008
RED," Old-fashioned fun
","An action comedy, starring Bruce Willis in self-referential (and slightly self-spoofing) mode? Yeah, Cop Out wasn't that great. Fortunately, Red is a stronger piece of material for two reasons: first of all, it's based on a really good comic-book by genre maestro Warren Ellis; secondly, Willis isn't paired with Tracy Morgan, but a talented ensemble including Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.The former John McClane plays Frank Moses, a retired man who spends his days sitting around the house, reading trashy romance novels and talking on the phone with an attractive woman (Mary-Louise Parker) working for the pension office. After a failed hit on his life, Frank - who is revealed to be a former CIA operative - discovers he's been labeled RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous) and decides to get to the bottom of the story with the help of a few ex-colleagues (Freeman, Malkovich, Mirren) and former enemies (Brian Cox), while a young, ambitious agent (Karl Urban) is on his trail.With the comedy/action balance firmly in place and the 'old people' angle (minor roles are played by veterans like Richard Dreyfuss and Ernest Borgnine) being a big part of the film's appeal, it could be easy to mistake it for an Expendables rip-off (Willis being in both movies is another element to consider). However, Red is a different beast: the tone is less tongue-in-cheek (there's no equivalent of the Stallone/Schwarzenegger encounter), and, with the exception of Willis, none of the actors have a reputation as actions stars, though they've all had experience in the genre, including Mirren (she previously played an assassin in Shadowboxer). As such, the film is a fun piece of entertainment that takes itself seriously enough to not become ridiculous, but is allowed to play with genre conventions.Almost inevitably, the plot is on the thinner side of things, primarily because the original comic is only used as the basis of the first five minutes. After that, it's up to the screenwriters to come up with a worthy follow-up plot: intriguing, but hardly more unpredictable than the average action movie. That it stays believable and enjoyable is, obviously, due to the cast: everyone appears to be enjoying themselves, particularly Malkovich who has another go at his more manic turns (see Burn After Reading), and the younger players - Parker, Urban, Julian McMahon - are up to the challenge. As for Willis, his solid and entertaining lead role ensures Cop Out is nothing more than a distant memory.Red may not be the best comic-book adaptation of 2010 (hello, Kick-Ass and Scott Pilgrim), but it's got the humor and energy to provide a nice couple of hours at the movies, plus characters that would be fun to watch again. A Malkovich-centric spin-off, perhaps?",7,0,0,9 December 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of an epic, unforgettable adventure
","It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: 'I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!', probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that.",10,2,4,13 December 2005
Munich," Gripping, shocking, unflinching, pessimistic, unforgettable
","For the past few years (since the Kubrick-inspired A.I., to be more precise), Steven Spielberg's production has started to show a more pessimistic reflection on what is going on in the world. Still, these films had some sort of happy ending. Munich doesn't. It's Spielberg's most violent and shocking opus so far, a voyage into the bleakest parts of the human soul.The movie begins with the kidnapping and assassination of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich, 1972. The entire world watches this event in horror on TV, while Israeli PM Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) makes a very controversial decision: those responsible for the massacre will not get away with it. And this is when the film really kicks off: Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana) and four other Mossad agents (Mathieu Kassovitz, Daniel Craig, Ciaràn Hinds and Hanns Zischler) are sent to Europe to track down and coldly execute 11 men, all involved in the Munich attack. Those five agents are initially eager to serve their country, only to become exactly like the very people they're meant to kill: each murder is expertly planned and committed, without any remorse. Avner and his men won't realize the truth (violence leads only to more violence) until it's too late.That's the aspect Spielberg's most interested in: under the disguise of a gripping, merciless thriller (which the film is) lies a painful reflection on how monstrous a person can be. When we first see Avner, he's an ordinary man who's about to be a father (one of the director's trademarks), as well as an enthusiastic patriot. Two hours into the movie, he's a paranoid murderer, afraid of the fact that someone, perhaps even his boss (the remarkable Geoffrey Rush), might try to hurt his family. He accepted his assignment without any questions, only to be left alone with his doubts: what if his actions won't change anything? What if the war will go on once he's done his job? Spielberg stated this film is a 'prayer for peace', and he's right, by proving violence isn't the best means to obtain it.Most people will say Munich is the most unusual Spielberg movie in that it has no happy ending. That's not really correct. The truth is it has no real ending at all. It's probably the most shocking aspect of this masterpiece: after two-and-a-half emotionally exhausting hours of pain, anger and death, there's no sign of joy or reconciliation. The 9/11 parallels, hinted at in previous pictures, emerge in an all their brutality come the desperate epilogue: some wars can't end, not even on film.",10,0,0,12 February 2006
Heat," Mann's masterwork
","Ever since his breakthrough in television with Miami Vice, which he executive produced, Michael Mann has had an eye for cops, and more specifically their relationship with the criminals they track down. Manhunter, his superb Hannibal Lecter film, showed this in a most admirable fashion, but it is Heat that will be remembered as his crowning achievement, one of the few must-see thrillers of the '90s (or of all time, for that matter).The title, as far as I can tell, comes from a quote in the movie: 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner'. That's the motto Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) observes every day, since every single second matters in his job: robbing banks. He has a great team working with him (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight), but if it became necessary he would leave all of them behind. Even his affair with a woman named Eady (Amy Brenneman, fresh out of NYPD Blue) is ultimately meaningless, just another expendable element of his life.Paradoxically, that same mantra could sum up the life of Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), an LAPD officer who finds it hard to juggle his ever demanding job and his fragile (third) marriage, which comes complete with a troubled stepdaughter (Natalie Portman). If he could, he would dump everything and commit wholeheartedly to his work. And the opportunity presents itself quite quickly when Neil's latest bank job doesn't end as well as usual and Vincent begins to close in on the previously elusive criminal, beginning a battle of wits like few have ever seen.Being a Mann film, Heat is technically perfect: from the cinematography to the spot-on editing (especially in the central heist sequence) to the locations (L.A. is to the director like New York to Scorsese), the film shows its big budget credentials without hesitation, making for one hell of a visual experience. Light and dark converge into a new shape, emphasizing Mann's point: the 'good' and the 'bad' guy aren't that distinguishable anymore.That leads to the other asset Heat can boast, namely Mann's key theme of hunted and hunter being substantially equal: Manhunter suggested this in a quite eerie way, and it returns here in one of the most talked-about scenes in movie history - the coffee shop encounter between Hanna and McCauley. 'I don't know how to do anything else' remarks the tired cop. 'Neither do I' comments the crook. 'And I don't much want to either'. 'Neither do I' McCauley repeats. There's a very thin line between the two sides of the coin, and Mann hasn't just blurred it, he's erased it for good.The coffee shop sequence also highlights Heat's main trump card: Pacino and De Niro. Justly described as the best actors of their generation, Mann's opus gives them the chance to actually meet on screen (which didn't occur, for obvious reasons, in their previous shared credit, The Godfather: Part II) and contrast their trademark personas - De Niro's controlled calm against Pacino's rage-fueled outbursts. They are accompanied by a terrific supporting cast (Kilmer, Voight, Portman, plus briefer roles for Ashley Judd and Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria), but it's their combined presence that makes Heat the gem it is: the best philosophical crime movie ever, and, alongside The Usual Suspects, the best thriller of the '90s.",10,5,10,22 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," In 1977, in a galaxy far, far away...
","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice 'scoundrel'), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you...",10,5,7,15 November 2005
Get Him to the Greek," The Russell Brand Show
","Although the lead role was ostensibly played by Jason Segel, many reckon (and justifiably so) that Forgetting Sarah Marshall really belonged to Russell Brand, whose deranged - and, to some degree, autobiographical - performance as a womanizing, junkie pop star was a consistent laugh magnet. Not a big surprise, then, to find out that the character received his own movie, albeit described in official circles as a 'semi-sequel' instead of a 'spin-off' to avoid comparisons with previous, failed attempts to flesh out minor characters from popular films. Well, one thing is certain: for all its flaws (and there are a few), Get Him to the Greek is no Evan Almighty.Aside from Brand reprising his role as Aldous Snow, the only other on-screen link with Sarah Marshall, not counting a brief but fun cameo by Kristen Bell, is Jonah Hill, playing a different character this time. Gone is Matthew, the hotel employee with a weird fixation for Aldous; welcome Aaron, a California record company employee with a weird fixation for Aldous. In fact, he suggests that, in order to boost the company's success, they bring the British singer from London to L.A. for a big comeback concert. His boss Sergio (P. Diddy) agrees, on one condition: Aaron himself has less than three days to get Snow across the Atlantic. This proves to be more difficult than anticipated, as Aldous is off the wagon, pining over former flame Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) and generally prone to behavior that could wreck the whole operation. To quote Bette Davis, 'It's gonna be a bumpy ride'.With no aid from Segel (who participated merely as a songwriter), returning director Nicholas Stoller is on scripting duty as well, and retains the first film's showbiz satire angle. While that got a bit out of hand last time, a tighter focus (solely the music industry) allows for greater, more genuine laughs: as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Aldous' outrageous lyrics are a hoot, and the presence of all the genre clichÃ©s - sex, drugs, booze, family issues, slutty girlfriends, et al - feels less trite and predictable than usual. Then again, not many movies begin with the 'hero' proudly proclaiming himself 'the African Jesus'.On the flip-side, the rom-com material isn't equally strong, the main 'arc' - Aaron's strained relationship with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Moss) - being a rather conventional and tired plot device that fails to convince throughout, climaxing in a cringe-worthy Chasing Amy spoof that wouldn't be bad if the storyline had been developed more carefully. A shame, because Moss, who proved to be the best thing in the dull Did You Hear about the Morgans?, shows once again that she has comedic skills to be reckoned with. The rest of the cast is just as reliable: the spotlight is inevitably on Brand, but the real standouts are P. Diddy's hilariously foulmouthed manager and Rose Byrne's spot-on 'troubled' British singer, showing off a knack for comedy never even hinted at in her previous roles (well, 28 Weeks Later... is hardly laughing matter).All in all, perfectly acceptable Apatow stuff: inconsistent but solid laughs, a game cast, terrific soundtrack and some neat movie references. Hardly a genre classic, but the Kubrick joke alone makes it worthwhile.",7,3,6,6 February 2011
300," Sin City it ain't, but still an awesome, breathtaking action movie
","Those drooling with anticipation for Sin City 2 (and 3) should give 300 a look, since it's similar to Robert Rodriguez's masterpiece: same source material (a graphic novel by Frank Miller), same filming technique (the backgrounds are all computer-generated) and, most important, same brutal atmosphere.Whatever Miller writes involves torture and death, and 300 is no exception. In fact, the beginning of the film is made more painful to watch by the fact that the events depicted really happened in that period: we're talking about a town, Sparta, so obsessed with physical perfection all disfigured male children were killed instantly. As for those who lived, the law established that they be taken away from their mothers at the age of 7 and not return to Sparta until they had become perfect killing machines. This same thing happened to Leonidas (Gerard Butler), the Spartan king the story revolves around, and this explains why he refuses to surrender when he's told the Persian army is about to invade all Greece. Since a true soldier would rather die than yield to the enemy, Leonidas chooses three hundred men (hence the film's title) to help him stop the Persians at the Thermopylae. Given the numbers (300 Spartans against one million Persians), it really takes lots of courage to embark on such a mission. And that is why, as the narrator (David Wenham) underlines, everyone will remember that battle.Being based on a comic-book, 300 is not a movie classicists should see: although his work was partly based on that of Greek historian Herodotus, Miller was more interested in writing a spectacular tale of love, loyalty and sacrifice, rather than an accurate account of this particular phase of the Persian war. And judging from the celluloid version, historical accuracy wasn't something director Zack Snyder (the man behind 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake) thought that much about either. His focus is on the scope and explicit brutality of the battle, and he cunningly uses his video-clip experience for that purpose: the fight scenes are among the most stunning in recent years, courtesy of smart editing, Lord of the Rings-inspired music and frequent use of slow-motion. In terms of style, 300 is every bit as mesmerizing as Sin City, each frame being filled with energy, beauty (as seen in the spellbinding oracle sequence) and, in the case of the battle scenes, lots of blood (enough to make Troy look like a PG-13 feature). The energy also emerges with insistence from the cast, particularly Butler's charismatic, relentlessly tough sovereign.However, 300 does have a few minor flaws: whereas Sin City was 100% faithful to the written page, there is one significant diversion from the graphic novel in the form of Gorgo (Lena Headey), queen of Sparta, who was barely shown in Miller's story but is employed by Snyder to tone down the testosterone and give some room to the political side of the events. Now, the confrontations between Headey's caring monarch and Dominic West's opportunistic traitor are interesting, but kind of slow down the film, as the audience's attention is all in the hands of Leonidas and his men. Also, Rodrigo Santoro's camp and flamboyantly gay portrayal of Persian emperor Xerxes robs all his scenes of the grandiosity present in the rest of the film.In the end, though, 300 stands out as the year's first great blockbuster, a compelling depiction of bravery (and extreme violence) and further proof that not all movies based on comic-books are dumb.",8,4,21,25 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Neither fantastic nor appalling
","Tricky thing, adapting comic-books: you can get a masterpiece like Spider-Man 2 or Batman Begins, but also a load of rubbish like Batman & Robin. Fantastic Four, based on Marvel's oldest creation, falls somewhere in between: it lacks that special something that made Sam Raimi and Chris Nolan's work unmissable, but has enough good material to elevate it above the utter silliness of Joel Schumacher's Bat-flick.Given the source comic is the most kid-friendly of the Marvel stable, director Tim Story wisely keeps the plot simple: five people doing research in space find themselves exposed to cosmic rays and almost die. Once back on Earth, they discover the radiations altered their DNA, giving them superhuman abilities: Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can stretch any part of his body as if it were rubber; Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) can become invisible and generate force fields; her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) is able to turn himself into a living flame, hence his superhero name Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed's best friend, has had his skin replaced with an exoskeleton made of rock, meaning he has superhuman strength and is substantially invulnerable. Unfortunately, he is also the only one of the four who can't 'turn off' his power, a discovery that makes him very angry and resentful. This prompts Reed to look for a cure with Susan's help, whereas Johnny just wants to have fun. Soon enough, though, they will have to join forces against the fifth member of the space trip, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), whose lust for absolute power is making him do increasingly monstrous things.Well, not so monstrous, perhaps: the PG-rating keeps the violence on a very harmless level, making the movie very similar to the comics in terms of tone, although that doesn't mean the action looks less spectacular than usual. What is less accomplished than usual, on the other hand, is the writing and character development: that the movie spends a lot of time explaining things is expected, almost acceptable actually, as this will make the possible sequel free to plunge straight into the action; even so, however, the writers must think most viewers have a flawed attention span, as they have Reed or Susan repeat the same thing ('The space storm radically altered the structure of our DNA...' and related gibberish) at least five times in a fifteen-minute time-frame.Another problem is the leading roles: Gruffudd and Alba do their best, but even that isn't much when their characters are given few relevant things to do or say and the relationship between them is essentially based on embarrassed looks and cheesy dialogue. The whole thing is made more surprising by the fact that one of the film's writers is Mark Frost, who managed to craft intelligent story lines on Twin Peaks but seems incapable of handling a simple romance in this case.The last significant defect is the villain: a respectable presence on paper, Dr. Doom is robbed of any charm on screen, partly because the script makes him little more than a Green Goblin clone (case in point: the scene where he offs several business partners is taken almost shot for shot from the first Spider-Man), partly because McMahon ends up playing him that way, failing to give the character that original mix of suaveness and amorality he effortlessly masters on Nip/Tuck.Thankfully, the two people comic-readers love the most happen to be the best thing in the movie as well: the Thing doesn't only look very realistic (the reason being a suit was used instead of CGI), he's also got a solid story arc, ably supported by Chiklis, one of the American small screen's recent revelations (The Shield), while Evans nails the Torch's wisecracking, energetic personality with an ease that is missing in Gruffudd and Alba's performances. Whenever those two are on screen, pulling pranks on each other or delivering their instantly recognizable catchphrases (Ben Grimm's 'It's clobberin' time!' being particularly delightful to hear), the picture gets back on track, albeit only for a few minutes.Overall, not incredibly bad but not that memorable either. Here's hoping the next installment will have more speaking in its favor.",6,0,1,21 December 2005
Jackie Brown," Accept no substitutes!
","Quentin Tarantino's third movie is his first literary adaptation, based on a novel written by his favorite author, Elmore Leonard (QT was actually offered the chance to direct another Leonard story, Get Shorty, which would have been perfect for him). The movie is Jackie Brown, and it's Tarantino's most mature effort so far (N.B. By 'most mature' I don't mean 'best', as I still prefer Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, particularly Volume 2), with real characters who feel real emotions and speak as they would in real life (the trademark speeches are awesome, but honestly, who talks like that at home?).At the center of the story is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), an air hostess who also works for gangster Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). She gets caught by two federal agents (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) who force her to cooperate if she wants to keep her job. A new who-gets-what game is about to start...As usual with Tarantino, a lot of the movie's strength lies in the writing: the realistic dialogue is a joy for the ear, and in terms of plot structure, every single character is important, from Keaton's cop to Chris Tucker's unlucky crook, and no one is there to merely serve the script; they're all interesting, human beings we will remember. And the actors who bring those people to life are extraordinary: former blaxploitation star Grier is of course the best, and her character's romance with bail bondsman Max Cherry (the Oscar-nominated Robert Forster) is one of the most convincing ever filmed. In the villain department, Sam Jackson shines as gun expert Ordell ('AK-47. When you got to absolutely, positively kill every motherf**ker in the room, accept no substitutes.'), and Robert De Niro (cast against type) makes a believable sidekick.Not as weird, innovative and fascinating as QT's other works, but absolutely, positively worth watching.",9,1,2,8 January 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," WHAT is the capital of Assyria? I don't know that!
","I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let's face it, if the Python hadn't showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet's masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.As suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their 'best' to screw everything up.As in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It's pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you're unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say 'Ni!' and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can't stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.Oh, and let's not forget Terry Gilliam's vital contribution: he doesn't appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure. Speaking of epic, this picture has one of the most brilliant tag-lines in comedy history, if not film history in general.Oh yes, the world wouldn't be quite the same without the Monty Python. Even the most miserable person on the planet will laugh like a lunatic after viewing any of their films.P.S. Ni!",10,80,97,28 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Force is strong with this one...
","Star Wars may have been a brilliant beginning, but it's The Empire Strikes Back that has made sure this epic saga will remain unforgettable. In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars-movie ever, alongside Revenge of the Sith. Darker and more mature than its predecessor, Empire is 100% masterpiece.As the saga got more mature, George Lucas handed the writing and directing duties to other people: the then unknown Lawrence Kasdan and Lucas'film-making tutor, Irvin Kershner. With these people's help, the movie became darker, Greek tragedy being added to the Flash Gordon-style situations. As for the characters, they became richer and more 'human' (the Han/Leia romance subplot is pure genius).Among all the great stuff, there are two things fans, but also 'ordinary' people, tend to remember more fondly about this film: First of all, this is the episode that introduced Yoda, and what an entrance he makes: those expecting the wise Jedi from the prequels won't believe what they're seeing. This Yoda is an old fool who starts playing with Luke Skywalker's tools, stealing his food and even hitting R2-D2 with his stick, before getting mentally stable again and accepting to train Luke, so that the young boy can face Darth Vader who, as the title (and John Williams'magnificent Imperial March) suggests, has an essential role in this movie.But most of all, this film will remain immortal thanks to its shocking climax: unexpected, unpredictable (unless you've already seen the prequels or the Simpsons-episode where Homer spoils it) and unforgettable, it's the stuff really great movies are made of.People say the second part of a trilogy is always the trickiest to achieve; well, in this case, it was worth all the trouble: the Empire doesn't just strike back, it totally wins!",10,1,2,16 November 2005

","'Will that give you satisfaction, my son? Killing a helpless,old,fart.' 'No.Not killing.Everything up until the killing, will be a gas.' This exchange between Rutger Hauer's evil Cardinal Roark and Mickey Rourke's human bulldozer Marv makes it pretty clear that in this movie, happy ending is no option.It's never gonna happen, 'cos we're talking about a world where only two sides of the law exist:bad side and much worse side.All characters are redemption-less, with the exception of Jessica Alba's angelic stripper Nancy, and even if we sympathize with these fellas, we know they had it coming if something bad happens.Sin City is the first literal adaptation of a comic-book:panels are recreated shot-for-shot, dialogs are directly transposed, the black and white town is entirely CG so it will look just like Frank Miller's astounding graphic novels.Miller and co-director Robert Rodriguez don't hesitate when it comes to showing disgusting or surreal situations: pedophilia, castration, cannibalism, talking corpses, several mutilated bodies, nothing is left behind, as we witness an ordinary day in the lives of Sin City's 'heroes'.The ensemble cast is simply awesome: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Alexis Bledel, Michael Clarke Duncan, Benicio Del Toro, they're all perfect. But the real STANDOUT is Mickey Rourke: his Marv is a brutal,sadistic,gladiatoresque psycho, but he's got a heart, and that's why we eventually end up loving him. Rodriguez has done to Rourke what Quentin Tarantino did to John Travolta with Pulp Fiction.Fitting comparison, since QT guest-directed this movie's most hilarious and weird sequence.In the movie Marv says'Hell is waking up every morning and not knowing why you're there.' Well, these guys know why they are in Sin City, and their return is already highly anticipated.Bring on the sequels!",10,2,4,11 October 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," A true winner
","After the rather disastrous response to The Beach (which wasn't completely unjustified), genre-hopping director Danny Boyle declared he works best at home, in the UK. How ironic, then, that his best film since Trainspotting - which was released in 1996 - is set in the low-life areas of Mumbai (better known to foreigners as Bombay), India. Then again, Slumdog Millionaire remains an eminently British production since, alongside Boyle, producer Christian Colson (The Descent), writer Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) and star Dev Patel (Skins) were all born and raised in good old England.The director's versatility pushes itself to the limit, considering the story revolves around the famous TV quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the opening title card informs us, a certain Jamal Malik (Patel), is one question short of winning the top prize. How did he do it? The show's sleazy host (Anil Kapoor) is convinced the boy cheated and calls the police, who arrest Jamal as soon as he leaves the studio (the final question will be answered the next day). He is questioned/tortured all night, simply because no one believes an uneducated 'slumdog' can be that smart or lucky (and let's not forget the host tried to set him up at one point). Jamal chooses to tell his story, revealing that the clues to the answers are all hidden in the key events of his brief, tragic life.At this point, the film follows a flashback-based structure: as every question of the quiz is displayed on the screen, Jamal recalls a specific incident that contributed to his current status. We are thus enabled to see the various tricks he and his older brother Salim used to earn money when they were kids, the religious persecution that led to the death of their mother, the multiple challenges in the form of local criminal gangs and, most of all, his pure, honest love for a girl named Latika (played by Freida Pinto in the present day sections). All these elements are connected. Or, as Jamal says: 'Maybe it is written.'.Shot with gritty realism on the real streets of Mumbai, the film reeks of hand-held energy and comes off as Boyle's most dynamic and vital movie in a long time. There's a certain similarity between Jamal getting by on the sidewalks and Mark Renton escaping from the police at the beginning of Trainspotting, and Boyle bravely acknowledges the connection by openly inserting a homage to his cult masterpiece's legendary toilet dive scene (the Slumdog Millionaire version takes the concept quite literally). He never looks away when things get ugly, but fundamentally this remains his most uplifting picture to date, so beautiful and touching it almost feels strange to know he nearly turned down the project, based solely on his lack of enthusiasm - to put it mildly - for the quiz aspect of the premise.The truth is, of course, a whole other thing: the game element is merely a MacGuffin, an abstract factor that serves only one purpose, namely starting the story and thus leaving room for the extraordinary circumstances under which Jamal, Salim, Latika and dozens of other children had to (and still have to) survive. In the end, no one really cares whether Jamal will win the top prize or not (although Boyle deserves credit for making the quiz sequences even more suspenseful than they are in real life); what matters is his story, the human story, the one everyone can relate to on some level.Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who against all odds (given his rather dark back catalogue) delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Calling him a millionaire is a tad inappropriate (the film was made on a shoestring budget), but thanks to this amazing story, Danny Boyle is a real winner.",10,6,12,7 February 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the perfect third movie
","The second Indiana Jones film, Temple of Doom, was quite successful but received a lot of criticism for being overall too dark , much like Tim Burton's Batman Returns. No such complaints were needed for the third installment: whatever angle one looks at it from, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is perfect from start to finish.As in the previous films, there's a mandatory opening scene that features great action and shows just how cool Indy is. However, there's a twist this time around: the prologue concerns the young Indiana (River Phoenix), and so the first fifteen minutes of the movie are spent revealing where he learned to master a whip and why he is so afraid of snakes. More crucially, though, the extended beginning shows a not-so-good relationship between the boy and his father, Henry Jones Sr., a theme that is brought up again with the more familiar Indy (Harrison Ford): he is asked to by an American millionaire (Julian Glover) to participate in an expedition whose aim is to retrieve the legendary Holy Grail. 'You've got the wrong Jones' Indy quips, only to discover his old man (Sean Connery) is the leader of the expedition and has mysteriously disappeared. Enter a globe-trotting adventure that will involve rats, Venice, the desert, Nazis, the return of Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and lots more, all told in the classic B-adventure style we're used to.Last Crusade is considerably lighter in tone than its predecessor, and therefore much more fun, with one set-piece after another, state-of-the-art visual effects and brilliant characters (Temple of Doom basically had only Short Round to brag about). In particular, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), while no match for Marion Ravenwood, is a more intriguing presence than the quite one-dimensional Willie Scott from the second flick, being at the center of one of the terrific script's greatest inventions (and given the film was released in 1989, it's some achievement they actually got away with it - you know what I mean if you've seen the movie).Ford is, of course, as excellent as he was in the other two Indies, but Crusade's real treat is Connery. His casting started as an in-joke (Spielberg said Indiana Jones was his version of James Bond, therefore Bond should be his father), but he lives up to expectations engaging in one hell of an acting duet with 'Junior', their conversations being packed with wit and warmth. Given the director's recurring use of father/son themes, there was a slight risk those scenes could come off as too schmaltzy for an Indiana Jones picture, but thankfully the Henry-Indy relationship feels completely natural and unforced, never once overshadowing the massive sense of fun that derives from the movie.Perhaps the best way to describe the spirit of these films is a wonderful scene where Jones Sr. and Jr. react to being hunted by Nazis. 'These men are trying to kill us!' the elder Jones remarks. 'I know, Dad!' comes the answer. 'It's a whole new experience for me!' Henry adds. 'Happens to me all the time' Indy says before heading out to continue seeking the Grail. That's Indiana Jones: always in trouble, always willing to go all the way. And he pulls you in with him.",9,0,1,28 May 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne is back in a superior sequel.
","Given the unexpected success of The Bourne Identity, a gritty, realistic spy story based on Robert Ludlum's eponymous novel, it was only a matter of time before someone started mentioning sequels (that there are, to date, three Bourne books certainly also helped). And so here we have The Bourne Supremacy, which retains the original's unique realism and stands out as the most compelling action flick of 2004.Picking up where the previous movie ended, Supremacy begins with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) trying to live in peace with Marie (Franka Potente), the woman who saved his life in Paris. But while he may have turned the back on his past, the latter still has unfinished business with him: a Russian assassin named Kiril (Karl Urban) has offed some important people in Berlin and managed to make the former spy look guilty, prompting a task force led by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) to initiate a manhunt across the globe. Forced back in action, Bourne must uncover some inconvenient secrets to prove his innocence. And as if he didn't have enough problems already, Marie is dead, accidentally killed instead of him by Kiril, making him even more determined to get through with his previous occupation once and for all.Shot in Goa, Naples, Berlin, Moscow and New York, The Bourne Supremacy is one of the most exciting races against the clock ever committed to celluloid, the director, Paul Greengrass, making everything look and feel so breathtakingly real (mostly thanks to hand-held cameras), despite putting his hero in situations most people wouldn't be able to handle. Luckily, Bourne's the right man, and so is Matt Damon, who plays the amnesiac assassin without trying to give him any unnecessary heroism. He's not here to show off, he just wants to be left alone. The film also improves on its predecessor by giving the supporting actors more space, thus allowing veterans like Cox, Julia Stiles and Chris Cooper (shown in flashback) to add extra meat to an already terrific job in the first movie and newcomer Joan Allen to shine in a handful of arresting conversations with Damon.With its breathtaking pace, excellent acting and incredibly audacious storytelling (the scene where Bourne tells a young woman he killed her parents is as bleak and moving as an action film will ever get), Supremacy is a spectacular sequel, raising the bar for the sure-to-come Ultimatum.",9,2,4,19 December 2005
Beetlejuice," Makes death look like a lot of fun
","It's only his second movie, and yet it is obvious Beetle Juice is pure, unmistakable Tim Burton: macabre, darkly comic and crammed with weirdos, not least Michael Keaton's career-best performance as the perverted titular 'bio-exorcist'.But what does a creature like that actually do? Well, it depends on who requires his services: in the case of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), a recently deceased married couple, he is supposed to get rid of the 'terrible people' (Jeffrey Jones and Helen O' Hara) who have taken over their house. As his employers will soon discover, though, Beetlejuice doesn't exactly play by the rules and has an agenda of his own, a fact that could cause more damage than expected. Unless the new owner's daughter, the death-obsessed Lydia (Winona Ryder), finds a way to stop him, that is.Burton was famously accused for favoring style over content in his two Batman films (fair assessment, but they're still awesome), something that can't be said of this black comedy: the visual element may be incredibly strong, especially in the fantasy sequences, but the director never loses track of the wonderfully witty script, taking the audience with him on a trip that, similarly to his later work Corpse Bride, paints a merrier portrait of the afterlife than we are used to imagine, albeit with the occasional grotesque scenarios and people.Oddly enough, the extravagant imagery is also where the film shows its biggest limit, as some of the special effects have dated quite badly, most notably a stop-motion animated snake that attacks Adam and Barbara in an early nightmare scene. Such shortcomings, however, are compensated by the consistent twisted humor and a committed cast: Baldwin and Davis are amusing in roles few people would imagine them playing, Burton-regular Jones is a reliable source of laughs and Ryder's 'troubled' teenager (not like her Heathers character, though) is a neat and charming counterpoint to her heartbreaking turn in Edward Scissorhands, also directed by Burton. But it is the underused Keaton (about 18 minutes of screen time in an almost two-hour long movie) who deserves the hot spot in the audience's memory: he is twitchy, rude, dirty and VERY naughty - nearly too much for a PG feature. And if that isn't enough, consider this: Burton wanted him and no one else to play Batman because of his work in this picture, and the result was the finest celluloid Dark Knight until Christian Bale took over the suit. That's gotta mean something, right?",8,1,2,18 February 2008
Valkyrie," What could have been...
","Nazis are a recurring motif in Bryan Singer's filmography: his third feature, Apt Pupil, dealt with the sick relationship between a teenager and a former SS officer, while the villain in the X-Men franchise, Magneto, is famously driven by his hatred for humanity after his family was wiped out at Auschwitz. Is it that strange, then, that when a project emerged concerning a failed attempt on Adolf Hitler's life in 1944 (all based on real events), Singer faced plenty of obstacles (problems with German authorities, re-shoots, constant changes of the release date) to get it done? The result is perhaps his least accomplished picture to this day, but when he gets it right, he gets it very right.One thing the movie makes very clear from the beginning is this: not all Germans were on Hitler's side, but usually those who didn't agree with his ideology kept it to themselves. When we first meet Colonel Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), he has already lost all faith in the Nazi dictatorship, and after losing his left eye, right hand and two fingers from the left during a military mission in Africa, he decides it's time to really do something. This leads him to joining forces with a group of disillusioned officers (Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp among them), who appoint him as the new leader of the conspiracy to kill Hitler (David Bamber). The plan they come up with is indeed very clever: using Hitler's own reserve army (the so-called Operation Valkyrie, hence the film's title), they will take over the control of Berlin and subsequently the rest of Germany once the Fuhrer has been blown to pieces. However, there's always a slight chance the operation might fail, and since not everyone at the Ministry of War (Tom Wilkinson's General Fromm, for example) shares their anti-Nazi mentality, they must be prepared to face the consequences, should anything go wrong.The main strength displayed by Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (the Oscar-winning author of the director's breakthrough feature, The Usual Suspects) is their decision to make the movie a thriller, not a history lesson (apart from the accuracy of the production design and costumes): the narrative moves at a quick pace, the mood is the same as in classics like The Manchurian Candidate and the entire second half of the picture reeks of pure, unadulterated suspense. This is a strength, but also a weakness: the plot structure and Singer's direction have the surprising effect of making the story tremendously exciting despite the obvious outcome (although, as the director commented in an interview, everyone knew how Titanic was going to end, and that didn't stop it from earning an obscene amount of money), but this also leads to most of the characters being depicted as mere pawns in the game. In fact, apart from Stauffenberg, no one is given enough psychological back-story to explain why they're doing what they're doing.And yet the characters are great fun to watch, and that's all due to Singer's trademark excellent eye for casting: the British group of supporting players (Wilkinson, Nighy, Branagh, Stamp, Tom Hollander and Kenneth Cranham) lend the picture the dramatic gravitas few American actors are able to give a period piece (even comedian Eddie Izzard keeps a straight face throughout proceedings), and Cruise, ostensibly chosen because of the resemblance between him and Stauffenberg, proves to be as solid a lead as ever and confirms, once again , that he's a better actor than most people give him credit for. Part of the actors' success lies also in Singer's vital decision to let everyone speak with their normal accents instead of trying to make them sound German, since he didn't want 'realistic' to become 'ridiculous' (and after seeing Mel Brooks' The Producers, it's hard to disagree). In fact, the only non-German cast-member who speaks with the 'correct' accent is Bamber, a choice that is easily explained: it's another effective way to distance Hitler from his adversaries, since the actor's speech pattern gives the dictator an additional aura of monstrosity.Valkyrie isn't a perfect film, that's a given, but it isn't as bad as the pre-release reports were keen to imply, either: it is in the hands of a very competent director, and what it lacks in detail it makes up for in pacing, tension and performances. Not bad for a picture a lot of people considered doomed while it was still in production.7,5/10",8,2,5,6 February 2009
The Simpsons Movie," THE greatest experience of summer 2007!
","Films that make one laugh within two minutes are very rare. Those that manage to do so within twenty seconds have practically never existed. Until now. The Simpsons Movie is a cracker right from the 20th Century Fox logo, where Ralph Wiggum pops up and does his own rendition of the company's celebrated fanfare. This shouldn't be unexpected, given the TV show, the most popular animated program of all time, has made fun of Fox countless times over the course of 18 seasons and 400 episodes. Now that the world's favorite yellow family has finally made the transition to the big screen, they even have the guts to do some self-spoofing, as the most famous dumb-ass in animation history, Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta), in a moment of truly inspired meta-cinematic madness (another one being Bart writing 'I will not illegally download this movie' on the chalkboard), states while watching an Itchy & Scratchy movie with his kids: 'I can't believe we're paying to watch something we could get on the TV for free! If you ask me, everyone in this movie theater is a big sucker! Especially YOU!'. The last sentence is accompanied by his finger pointing directly at the camera, before the familiar title sequence begins, proving beyond any doubt that: a) Homer is deservedly considered the greatest television character ever aside from Fonzie; b) It was totally worth waiting 18 years for The Simpsons Movie.Having been kept a secret for months prior to the film's release, the plot is actually ridiculously simple: because of the growing concern for the environment, no one is allowed to dump garbage in Lake Springfield anymore. However, someone ignores this and dumps a load of pig, uh, crap in the water, causing a major pollution and prompting the President, Arnold Schwarzenegger (!), to charge Russ Cargill (Simpsons veteran Albert Brooks) with securing the area. Hence a gigantic glass dome that isolates Springfield from the rest of the world, prompting the inhabitants to put a price on the responsible's head. His name? Homer Simpson, of course ('D'oh!').Naturally, he chooses to run off to Alaska, only to realize he will eventually have to deal with what he has done and seek forgiveness. But given he is Homer, he might as well try to have some fun on the way, leaving it to Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and everyone's favorite TV brat, Bart (Nancy Cartwright), to actually save the day.Considering the differences in creative freedom between big and small screen, one might think, even hope, The Simpsons Movie will be edgier than the TV version. Those people will be sorely disappointed, as the film tries to be nothing more than a 90-minute version of one of the best episodes of the show, and succeeds. Then again, it's not like the feature length counterparts of Beavis & Butt-head or South Park were that different from the network originals (aside from the swearing not being bleeped out in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut). And in the particular case of The Simpsons, its longevity has made it an indelible, recognizable part of everyday life, meaning any changes in tone or themes would be like betraying the show's spirit. Thus, except for a few PG-13 gags regarding sexual orientation (Ned Flanders: 'The Good Lord is telling me to confess to something' Homer: 'Gay gay gay gay gay gay gay...') and bestiality (Homer's weird relationship with a pig), everything is just as all remember it: Lisa is still an annoying smart kid, Bart is still a master of mischief, his dad is still incredibly, deliriously moronic, Mr. Burns (creepy, despite only two scenes at his disposal) is still a vicious evildoer, and the movie is a rock-solid reminder of why the series is the ultimate cult program.All a die-hard Simpsons fan is looking for, he will find here. Hilarious physical gags? Check, in fact the bigger screen allows the 11 writers (just imagine if this gets an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay), including creator Matt Groening, to come up with more spectacular stuff than usual (just watch as Homer finds himself between a rock and a hard place - literally!). Tender moments between Homer and Marge? Heck, probably the best in Simpsons history! The big, fat bloke strangling Bart? Check ('I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!'). Movie spoofs? Check ('Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig...'). Celebrity guest appearances? Just one (Tom Hanks; Arnie is voiced by Harry 'Mr. Burns' Shearer)), but it is priceless.In the end, all these things turn The Simpsons Movie into an unstoppable gag-machine, a film that will make you laugh for the entirety of its running time, the most fun anyone will have in a cinema this year. Hell, it is so good it is hard, if not impossible, not to say: 'Yeah!' once one of the characters, resuscitating the movie's self-awareness, asks the fundamental question: 'Sequel?'. Let's just hope it doesn't take another 18 years to make it...",8,5,13,30 July 2007
Atonement," Cruel, touching and utterly brilliant
","Teenage angst, war, love, regret, redemption and the power of words: all these themes are beautifully tied together in Atonement, which is quite simply one of the best literary adaptations of all time. It is so good, in fact, that I feel compelled to discourage viewers from reading the book before they see the movie, as Ian McEwan's striking, audacious prose is impossible to resist, but will also lessen the impact of the most shocking film epilogue I've seen this year.Much more adult than director Joe Wright's previous pairing with Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice), Atonement is quite similar to Capote in its analysis of the writing process and the sacrifices the author has to make. The author in question is Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year old who is going to have her cousins perform a play she has written, the occasion being a dinner party at the family estate in the British countryside (the year is 1935). During the preparations, she notices the sexual tension between her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) and gardener Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and misinterprets certain signals, leading to a pretty big lie that ruins the evening and destroys the young lovers' future.The film then cuts to World War II, deftly moving from a Merchant-Ivory England to a ravaged France, where Robbie is stationed and forced to witness atrocities every day, his only consolation being the hope that he will meet Cecilia again some day. Back in London, instead, both of the Tallis sisters work as nurses, albeit completely isolated from one another, leaving Briony (Romola Garai) with plenty of time to think about her mistake and plan what to say, should all three ever happen to be in the same room one last time.Although I said this is primarily a movie about writing, another key theme that never leaves the picture is a painful reflection on lost youth, evident in the casting choices: almost all the roles are played by twenty-somethings (the more adult parts, like Brenda Blethyn's cameo, are so brief they barely matter), and every single scene focuses on either Briony, Cecilia or Robbie, emphasizing how one little event altered three lives radically. Such attention to character requires good acting, and the performances are all equally superb: McAvoy, sad and angry, carries the film's second half with no fatigue at all, Knightley is dark, complex and very sensual in her first adult role, and the Ronan/Garai duo embody the young scribbler's ambition and ingenuousness with impressive sincerity.Every bit as seductive are the visuals, further proof of the great eye Wright had displayed on Pride and Prejudice. None of the beautiful sequences, however, are there merely for their own sake, each and every one of them, even when evoking the director's previous work (the fog and rain look very familiar), having the purpose of setting a specific mood, a task in which they succeed at all times. One sequence in particular blends Wright's unique visual style with the impenetrable sadness he intends to convey: a five-minute tracking shot that follows Roobie's walk on a French beach amongst mutilations, deaths and overall suffering. Not since Scorsese followed Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco through the Copacabana's rear entrance has a long take stuck in my memory with the same intensity. Also notable is the movie's only sex scene which, no matter how tender, leaves an omen of tragedy in the air, making the tormented love story even more excruciating to watch.And yet, for all the great thesping, editing and lensing, Atonement is, fundamentally, a story about the impact of the written word. The best writers are those who manage to trigger contrasting feelings in the reader, often simultaneously, which is why the bold, relentlessly cruel epilogue (featuring a priceless Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Briony) is so moving and infuriating in its controlled manipulation of what has just been seen. A masterpiece.",9,8,15,9 December 2007
The Island," An interesting and amusing sci-fi thriller
","When you go to see a Michael Bay movie,you expect there to be a LOT of action and a so-so story. However,in the case of The Island,the story comes first(yes,there is some great action on the way,but the subject happens to be more intriguing).The movie is set in 2019(same year as Blade Runner),in a utopian facility where thousands of people,who have survived the 'great contamination',wait to win the lottery so they can go to the Island,the last remaining paradise on the planet. That is,until Lincoln Six Echo(Ewan Mcgregor)and Jordan Two Delta(Scarlett Johansson)escape after discovering the awful truth: they're all clones and when they win the lottery,it means their 'sponsors' need new organs or something. This is where the fun begins,as Dr.Merrick(Sean Bean)hires Albert Laurent(Djimon Honsou)and his team to catch the two fugitives.Michael Bay tackles the subject (cloning: should we or shouldn't we?)so that the film's never boring,while inserting his trademark action sequences to prove he still can do what Jerry Bruckheimer made him famous for.Not as great as other sci-fi flicks,but still enjoyable.As for the actors,Sean Bean does his usual job well,while Scarlett Johansson has done better.Mcgregor is quite good actually,particularly in the hilarious scenes between Lincoln and his Scottish 'sponsor'. The best one,however,is Steve Buscemi,as the only real 'human' in the story('Jeez,why do I always have to be the one to tell the kids there is no Santa Claus?).",7,2,5,31 August 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Another Coen ride!
","Despite the 'based on Homer's The Odyssey' credit at the beginning of the film, Ethan and Joel Coen claim to have never read the book. It's hard to believe otherwise, because aside from explicit plot references to the great Greek poet O Brother, Where Art Thou is a pure piece of Coen extravaganza: iconic characters, silly names, absurd situations and dialogue worth remembering.The brothers' fourth 'comedy' (after Raising Arizona, Barton Fink and The Hudsucker Proxy) tells the story of three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) who manage to break out of jail and set out to find a buried treasure (1.2 million dollars) somewhere in a Depression-stricken Mississippi. Everett Ulysses McGill (Clooney), a man who knows how to talk his way out of trouble, is also determined to win back the love of his wife Penny (Holly Hunter). During their colorful journey they run into a trumpet player who says he has sold his soul to the Devil and form a country music band to avoid regular people's suspicions, something that ought to come in handy when law enforcers, an evil salesman (John Goodman) and even the Ku Klux Klan are looking for them.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a light affair, but that doesn't make it less satisfying than other Coen brothers pictures: alongside their usual care for dialogue and performance (Clooney and Turturro are the standouts), plenty of plaudits should go to their reconstruction of the historical period the movie takes place in, particularly through Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography. In addition, given the story, the soundtrack is another source of joy, especially when the Soggy Bottom Boys (that would the stage name used by the main characters) perform in front of an audience. It's a hilarious film filled with vitality and happiness, and a strangely optimistic piece of work coming from the Coens.In short, this is another artistic triumph for cinema's most talented brothers, definitely worth watching, even if you haven't read the (alleged) source material.",10,0,0,24 August 2008
The Godfather," Watching this timeless masterpiece is an offer no one can refuse
","Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes 'offers that can't be refused'. It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all.",10,2,5,14 March 2006
