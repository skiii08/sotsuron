The Longest Yard," a very funny remake
","Adam Sandler leads an all-star cast to pull together a very funny remake of The Longest Yard, originally created in 1974 starring Burt Reynolds. Sandler plays Paul 'Wrecking' Crewe, a former quarterback of the professional football league. Crewe finds himself behind bars as he leads police on a high speed drunken chase. All bets are off as Sandler is forced to pull together a group of lawless inmates to face the guards in what Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) calls a 'tune-up' game.Sandler once again snags a hit with a sports film, with other successes being Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy. Fellow SNL alum Chris Rock takes on the role of Caretaker, the lovable team manager, whose wise cracks and racial dialogue keep you laughing from first to last shot. The biggest acting surprise of all comes in the form of Michael Irvin, who has no films to his credit, plays the very talented wide receiver (shock) Deacon Moss. I suppose all the time in front of the camera on ESPN Sunday mornings has paid off.I would sum up The Longest Yard as a 'pick me up' summer laugh riot to make up for a season of 'not so funny' films. This is one of those classic underdog stories that climaxes with one of the finest theatrical football games I've ever seen.",7,0,2,13 July 2005
Constantine," sub-par acting with a pitiful story
","Released on DVD this past week, Constantine is the story of modern day exorcist John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) who teams up with local cop Angela Dodson (Rachael Weisz) to investigate the suicide of Dodson's twin sister. They end up uncovering the dark plans of hell's minions to take over the planet, unleashing a violent apocalypse. Despite his careless attitude, Constantine is forced to help in earth's darkest hour.This kind of role for Keanu just does not work for me. Sure, we're used to seeing him strut around in black trench coats with that dazed and confused look on his face, but in a time where planet earth is set to be destroyed, I sure hope we could find a better savior than Keanu. The acting award for this film definitely goes to Weisz, despite looking nothing like a cop (especially from New York City).The producers obviously use the great special effects to cover up the sub-par acting and pitiful story. There is nothing worse to me as a movie lover than to see a comic book film fail to seem anything like a comic strip, which Marvel has been so successful in doing the past few years (With exception of Fantastic Four and The Hulk). This is more like Gothic time for all of the pale and anorexic 'outcasts' who await their dark lord (Geeeeeez, someone give those people a hug or something).",2,2,6,21 July 2005
Closer," attention to sex, and lots of it
","Legendary director Mike Nichols turns his attention to sex, and lots of it, in the highly controversial Closer. The entire cast is full of Academy Award nominees and winners including Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen (rumored to be the next James Bond). The story revolves around four strangers who make one another's lives miserable as they continually love and cheat on one another. This is a very chatty film, but luckily for Nichols the screen writing by Patrick Marber is so jaw-dropping that it could keep the focus of an auditorium full of attention deficit disorder teens for the entire hour and forty minutes.All four bring very different personalities to their characters, some who lead a false existence and others that are so brutally honest with one another that it is scary. It seems like an ultimate showdown between real and fake in the dangerous game of commitment. I love the overall message and tone of the film, as Nichols shows how easy it is to love and even easier to lose.I couldn't help but shake my head at some of the things I heard from this film, some of it actually making me laugh because of its excessive use. Of all the talent, I was surprised by Julia Roberts the most in this film. You just don't expect her to be as controlled and fragile as she is in this role. But, it's Julia Roberts, and she pulls it off. All of the unfaithfulness seems to take a shot at the 'flighty' high school and college generation we live with.Boy loves girl. Girl loves boy. Boy and Girl move in together. They cheat on each other. Boy and Girl hate one another. Repeat.",5,0,2,18 July 2005
Batman Begins," This film is a sight for sore eyes
","After four attempts from two different directors, the third, Christopher Nolan (Memento), gets it right. Batman Begins picks up in the beginning (hence the title), as Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is in what looks to be a Japanese prison camp. Flashbacks work well for this film, as Wayne's childhood is revealed with much more depth than the original four films depicted. As Wayne is tracked down and trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) more and more is revealed about his parents' death and his awful fear of bats.The cast is full of Oscar worthy talent. Michael Caine plays the loyal Wayne butler, Alfred with Morgan Freeman as the weapons specialist, Luscious Fox. But it is the young talent of this cast that steals the show (Except for Katie Holmes.sorry sweetheart). Christian Bale is the best Batman to date and Cillian Murphy masters the villain role as the brash psychologist, Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka Scarecrow.I am most impressed with the realism brought to the film by Nolan. Don't expect any comic book colors and set designs. This film is a true masterpiece of darkness and vengeance. The new Batman costume itself is even darker, showing the anger that fuels our heroes every action.This film is a sight for sore eyes in this summer slump of blockbuster hits. I am very much looking forward to seeing the next installment of the franchise, but please, no more Val Kilmer of George Clooney as the caped crusader. Keep Bale!!!!!!",10,1,3,10 July 2005
Million Dollar Baby," most deserving winner of the Best Picture
","In honor of its recent release to DVD, I have chosen Million Dollar Baby to review. Never have I had so many ask me about a single film, 'Josh, is it good? Should I buy it? Is it worth it?' After telling them how great it is, I usually tell them that I called it back in January when I was walking out of the theater and said to my dad, 'That's gonna win best picture pops.' (He smartly agreed with his great prophet sonOK, so maybe not great, but a proved prophet by that statementhaha) Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn, the spiritually lost and hard nosed boxing manager of many successful men. Hillary Swank, who won best actress for her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, battles through poverty and a trashy family to finally get Dunn to manage and train her. Morgan Freeman also offers his much welcomed services as Eddie Dupris, which he also took home an Oscar for best supporting actor.As Ron Howard did with Cinderella Man, Clint Eastwood brings a contender from the pits of a metaphorical hell in order to contend for the ultimate dreambecoming world champion in professional boxing. In a special twist, it is the women's division of boxing, instead of the over-used men's division. The boxing ring works as a sanctuary for the character's, keeping them from an outside world that seems to bring them nothing but bad news (I don't think Freeman's character leaves the gym once in the film).'Baby' is a film filled with Eastwood's Dirty Harry attitude that is meant to cover up a sensitive heart and caring man. The interaction between the cynical trainer Frankie and hard working Maggie can be so comical that you sometimes forget you are watching a serious drama. The comic relief along with the tough decisions we must make in life play well in this most deserving winner of the Best Picture of the year for 2004.",10,2,4,20 July 2005
Garden State," one of my favorite films of 2004
","In one of my favorite films of 2004, Zach Braff (Televisions Scrubs) writes, directs and stars in Garden State. Braff is Andrew Largeman, an unsuccessful actor who returns home to New Jersey for his mother's funeral. A childhood accident, in which he paralyzed his mother, has his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm) keep him heavily medicated. An emotionally closed off young man, he reunites with childhood friends and family as he takes a 'vacation' from the sedated and secluded life he leads in Hollywood.Braff shows great promise as one of the up and coming storytellers in the business today. He has a great eye for symbolism which can be easily compared to legendary Mike Nichols, whose projects include The Graduate and Closer.This 'dramedy' has so many scenes that can either bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye. With the aid of an all-star cast, which includes Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard, Braff pulls off a low budget success that will bring back memories of Benjamin Braddock from The Graduate. Putting so much on line, primarily his name, Braff shows great versatility which pays off in this funny drama.",9,0,1,16 July 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," a funny good time for kids and adults
","The brilliant Tim Burton impresses me once again, this time with his dark remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (I will be the first to admit that I was expecting a corny family filmit proved me wrong). Young and charming Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) has only one wish, and that is to visit the legendary chocolate factory of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp stars as the upbeat, yet bitter candy man (his version portrays Wonka as a wannabe crack addictand it works very well in this 'family' film). Charlie gets his wish after several attempts and finds a golden ticket, giving him and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) a free tour of the factory led by Wonka himself. Along with four other snot-nosed brats and their parents, the group finds mischief and adventure around every corner.Burton's bright and colorful world for the film contradicts his usual darker style (like Batman and Edward Scissorhands), but it works as for one day the young boy goes from a life of poverty to riches in what many children would depict to be there own version of heavencandy everywhere and very bright lights.The choice of Depp to play Wonka could not have been any better of a fit. He's irritable, cranky, careless, and dumb. Not to say Johnny is any of those things in real life (wink wink), but if you want an actor to pull it off and still have all of America love you for itthen Johnny is your man. This is a funny good time for kids and adults (I actually saw more people my age than kids at the theater).",7,4,6,17 July 2005
The Graduate," Top 5 Film Class Movies: FILM #4
","I am going 'Old School' with my 4th favorite film from class with Mike Nichols coming of age hit The Graduate. A very young Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, an extremely shy and indecisive college graduate. He returns home with the pressures from his family and friends about his future goals (which he could care less about). The very attractive Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) turns Ben's life upside down when they begin sleeping together. The situation does not get any easier for the young man as he falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, despite a stern warning from the seductress.You would not know it unless you watched this film two or three times, but Nichols is a genius with the symbolism he uses in showing the confusing journey that is Benjamin's life. Framed portraits of clowns on the wall, the water motif, and the selective focusing are just a few of the now famous traits of his film that shows the goofy mannerisms and entrapment Ben has encountered. Hoffman portrays one of the finest 'airheads' I've ever seen on screen. Not in the sense of someone who is dumb, instead someone who is always unsure and careless.This film is listed as a comedy, but probably will not provide the guffaws most would expect. The comedy comes from the relatable situations Braddock faces and the very odd ways he chooses to handle them. 'Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me. Aren't you?' Even this famous quote shows his unconfident demeanor and social anxiety. Nichols also shows his psychic abilities with Ben receiving the unwanted advice to invest in 'plastics.' Keep in mind, this film was made in 1967.",7,1,3,27 July 2005
War of the Worlds," a visually stunning tale of a family fighting to survive
","Truer words have never been spoken.'Spielberg will not let you down.' War of the Worlds reunites director Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise for a visually stunning tale of a family fighting to survive an all out attack from blood thirsty aliens. The assault leaves even the audience feeling helpless due to the gigantic robots (which have been buried at the Earth's core for millions of years) vaporizing humans and destroying the tallest buildings.This film has some of the most memorable shots I've ever seen in a movie. I can still feel the chill going down my spine as one of the robots comes over a mountain and looks down at its eventual prey on the dark boat, desperate to leave (Just not fast enough). Spielberg also hits home on some human aspects of disaster, which includes the panic in times of crisis. Even the continuously crying Dakota Fanning, Tom's daughter in the film, feels the wrath of ruthless citizens wanting to steal their transportation. The overall human drama brings back images seen on the news from September 11, 2001.This is a film that is not strong in story and character development (Tim Robbins has a part that I still cannot figure out), but the special effects will keep your attention as only Steven Spielberg can do. Caution to all claustrophobics out there, some scenes will have you begging for anti-depressants (Despite a severe scorning from Mr. Scientology himself, Tom Cruise).",6,1,3,8 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Hide your bridesmaids!!!!
","Hide your bridesmaids!!!! Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn star in this hilarious adventure of two best friends who take time out of every year to crash weddings and make a perfect impression on emotionally fragile women. But what happens when one of these 'pimps with hearts of gold' falls in love? A wonderful montage in the beginning of this laugh riot gives an insight to every con and deceiving line the two utilize in obtaining gorgeous bridesmaids. One of the most impressive parts to this film is how the actors' are so good at switching from slapstick vulgar comedy to sugar sweet drama queens. Rachael McAdams plays Claire Cleary, the beautiful daughter of Secretary of Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken). Her smile lights up the screen and she proves she can hold her ground with comic heavyweights like Wilson, Vaughn, and Walken.Vince Vaughn's name may appear second to Owen's on the marquee, but it is his portrayal of Jeremy Klein that will keep you rolling in the isle. McAdams is so gorgeous too, making me forget completely about my undying love for Jessica Alba. As she does in the movie, she makes even this bachelor want to commit to a relationship.",7,1,3,16 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the same two and a half hour space geek adventure
","Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith concludes George Lucas's space opera which first took flight back in the 1970's. The sixth installment (technically number 3 in the series, but who really cares) focuses on Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) transformation from Jedi Knight to the Dark Side apprentice, Darth Vader. Every little detail that leads up to the already released Star Wars: A New Hope is the focal point of this final act.Thank goodness George Lucas can wow us with his special effects, because his choice of actors, mainly Christensen, is obviously to keep payroll at a minimum. Ewen McGregor and Natalie Portman are the only highlights of the cast.All and all it is the same two and a half hour space geek adventure for those who have nothing to do on a Friday or Saturday night (I saw it on a Friday night, so what does that say about me?). But since you have already invested much time and money to see the first five films, you might as well finish it off. I will admit that the transformation from Anakin to Darth is very interesting to watch, as the usual glowing young Jedi knight becomes the dark menace, so infuriated with the state of the world he lives in (Kind of like a space model of Michael Moore, without all the protesting, facial hair, and fat rolls). I'm sure if Lucas runs out of his millions, he will shell out another three to six of these movies.",3,3,6,12 July 2005
Fantastic Four," Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers
","The summer was off to such a promising start of superhero movies with the release of the unbelievably good Batman Begins, so of course I was stoked to take in a sneak preview of Fantastic Four. Unfortunately, I was let down by the Stan Lee and Marvel Comic creation. Five scientists venture to deep space in order to study DNA patterns of the human body. All suffer severe changes from a space storm.4 for good, 1 for evil.Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers. I was glad to see at least the villain Dr. Doom, played by Julian McMahon, was having a little fun with his newly found powers. Most of the film is useless 'family feud' banter between the four 'heroes.' The only real highlight of the film is Ben 'The Thing' Grimm played by Michael Chiklis (from televisions The Shield). Excellent make-up and voice work of this rock creature, who is the only one who can't morph back to human form, steal the show.I don't think the creators were going for a comedy with this film, but that's what they got (Half the time you laugh at the poor acting). Through my disappointment overall of this film, I did find myself smiling at one crucial part of the filmJessica Alba in her bra and panties. Hey, the Invisible Woman has to disappear somehow, right? WOO-HOO!!!",1,14,24,7 July 2005
Cinderella Man," will do down as the greatest movie viewers will never see
","The cell phone throwing Russell Crowe plays the underdog and lovable James J. Braddock, a boxer who is hit hard financially and emotionally by the great depression in Cinderella Man. The always brilliant Paul Giamatti (who is most deserving of a best supporting actor nod come awards season) plays Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould. Renee Zellweger is just as impressive as Mae Braddock, the strong-willed wife and mother. Ron Howard successfully directs this riches to rags story of the Braddock family, who once lived with luxury in a beautiful home, now scrap for food and heat as tenants of an awful 'apartment.' With the success of such boxing flicks as Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man struck me as very unique due to the underlying story of a family binding together to survive in very dangerous times. I would say only about one-third of this film is dedicated to boxing, the rest following the character's long battle with poverty (not to take away from the visually grueling boxing matches).I've said this since its release in June of 2005, this films only mistake is not waiting until the fall and winter months for its release. It will get some love come awards season, but will do down as the greatest movie viewers will never see.",9,0,0,9 July 2005
