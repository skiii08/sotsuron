"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," An average story in a peculiar London
","Hmmmmmm. Well firstly, this is definitely a film directed by an American. The sickeningly sugar coated view of life in London could only really be portrayed so naively by someone who wasn't bought up here. The friendly cup cake shop on the corner of the pretty litter-free street is a prime example of this. However, moan over, Run Fatboy Run (which is now mentally set in London mark 2) is a pleasantly entertaining film. There are some cheap laughs- the brilliantly stereotypical character of Mr. Goshdashtidar offers up some amusing one liners. What else is amusing (another moan) is the plot of this film. It takes an intellectual genius to predict this storyline..... If only. The one dimensional characters plod slowly to the films' ending which (believe me) does arrive eventually. Though admittedly,this is a guilty pleasure, but I don't recommend for anyone wanting anything remotely challenging. Not Pegg's finest hour- but it could be worse.",5,0,1,4 December 2010
Crazy Heart," A beautifully stunning,under-rated classic.
","I first saw Crazyheart with my Dad in a small cinema in London- in all honesty I wasn't expecting much. The mere thought of sitting through an hour and a bit of one drunk old man's self pitying comeback attempts (the impressions I originally had of the film) wasn't very appealing. However, popcorn in hand and expectations low, I was shocked very soon. The highest praise I have to sing for this film is it's beautiful soundtrack. As a country fan, I was expecting some pretty awful songs to come out of Crazyheart; however I was pleasantly surprised. Jeff Bridges' voice truly is made for country- in fact this main role is played by him so convincingly one could easily forget this was a fictional film. Crazyheart is extremely well written and it's storyline truly touching. 'Bad Blake' is not the most lovable of characters, but I found myself sympathising with him greatly. Crazyheart contains some stunning shots and is beautifully understated. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic, as in my opinion that's what this film is. The disc will ever remain right at the top of my DVD pile, and the soundtrack in my head. Watch it.",9,1,1,4 December 2010
