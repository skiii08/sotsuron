The Avengers," No spoilers: it had lots of great humor, amazing action and a solid story
","Got to see a sneak preview tonight in 3D. It really does have everything a great action movie needs. The story was good, lots of kudos to the director Joss for making it an amazing movie. There were moments of intense action, scenes of sharp humor and each character got to show their strength in a very good way - and not just the physical portion of it. I can't wait to watch it again to see everything I didn't catch the first time. This will, hopefully, blow away the critics of the comic book genre and make new fans - it really brought a lot of what the Avengers is to the screen. Can't wait to see what's next!",9,1,4,30 April 2012
Captain Marvel," Very good movie and great tie ins
",Went in super excited and came out even hungrier for the final chapter of this story. Carol Danvers story is really well put together and how she is shown growing into her powers and her abilities is good. The battle with the Skrulls and Kree throws some interesting jabs at you and how it all comes together is cool. My only grievance is how that big battle scene is a bit dark per the environment it was in but I would have enjoyed it a bit lighter to see more of the scenes.,9,3,11,9 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Wonderful end to the saga
","I remember being in line for the original Star Wars and truly enjoying it. There were several misses and lots of hits from then on. This final chapter to the Skywalker saga was quite well made. There were plots resolved, characters we've seen develop finally meeting their destiny and the goodbye to some favorite heroes and villains.
It's got lots of action, good scenes and some which made me tear up from so much sadness but I have enjoyed the ride and am grateful for these last three movies.",8,2,7,20 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Holy yes!
","This movie was such a great bundle of fun, it's colorful, crazy active and so funny. It moves like a living comic book at times with so much action and laughs thrown in.
Loved how the story flowed, the characters all had great personalities and the build to the climax will keep you on the edge. Can't wait to own this one.",9,5,9,24 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Solid movie
","No spoilers.
I have watched every movie in the MCU and Avengers:Endgame is such a great movie to top off all these characters fighting for Earth and the universe. The Russo's have made a solid story, merged so many tales and lives and brought these characters from the pages of a comic book into breathing, feeling life.
Thank you for such a great culmination of so many twists and turns.",9,0,0,27 April 2019
The Lion King," Good movie, it's hard to live up to a classic animated movie
","Oh how far the CGI has come. There are some scenes which you expect David Attenborough's narration to come through, 'Here in the deepest part of...'
The CGI is really spectacular on many of the eyes of the characters for example on Rafiki's baboon close up's those eyes are so detailed and expressive it was just incredible to see. Some of the lion's expressions were less so which was a bit of a let down. Felt as if they could have gone a bit more facially cognizant to present more feeling.
Once again, Pumbaa and Timon do some great scenes and just make you crack a smile. Glover was great, Beyonce did a good job but hearing James Earl Jones once more as Mufasa is the true deal. There was a bit cheer in the beginning of the movie and another one at the end so the folks enjoyed it (yes, there were some crying children in between scenes but it's a Disney movie).",7,1,5,20 July 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Absolutely amazing
","...and so the story ends but it's a wonderful ride! Not giving any spoilers in this - only going to say: bring tissues and enjoy the amazing movie which Mr. Jackson gives us. Here's hoping he DOES manage to make the Hobbit, for this director/writer/producer is especially talented in making Mr. Tolkien's words into movies. 10/10 - in my opinion!",10,0,0,17 December 2003
