Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Entertainment!-there was no way to live up to the hype!
","Anyone who gives this movie a bad review is a wet blanket! It was pure entertainment! Sure it was a little short of real human drama,but the effects and the overall entertainment level was awesome! The Pod Races were exciting.I loved the cameos from Jabba and Bip Fortuna.Sure,this movie isnt going to change the world,but it definitely will bring a whole new generation into  the Star Wars saga!",8,0,0,1 June 1999
Fight Club," Some people will never get it
","This is a movie you either love or hate.I happen to love it.There has never been a movie like it before,but rest assured the imitators will be following in droves.The directing is unbelievable! I cant wait for Fincher's next film! Ed Norton (as always) is outstanding.And Brad Pitt(who,for some reason i'm always trying to find reasons to dislike)was very convincing.Pitt is blessed with some of the best lines in moviedom that I have heard in some time.Very memorable! I recently bought this film on DVD and I have already spent 5-6 hours on the first disc alone! I cant wit to get to the supplemental disc.The packaging is also unique and very creative.The DVD really brings out great points even more than the theatre at times.I could go on and on,but most of what I have to say has been said on this board already.For you people who dont get it,YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE MISSING!",9,2,6,20 January 2001
Monster," Grim...but good...
","This is NOT a movie for the 'date crowd' or for 14 year old boys looking for a blockbuster.This is a grim ,hard movie to watch about real things happeing to real people.The acting was superb.Charlize WILL get the oscar for this performance.If she doesnt, its highway robbery.Between this and 21 grams , I dont know which was harder to watch.I love movies that are real and gritty like these.MAKE MORE OF THEM!",8,0,0,2 February 2004
Blade," What the Matrix wanted to be
","I thought Blade was a pretty good action movie,and it should be taken as that.It had elements of Dracula,the Terminator,Star Wars and Batman all rolled into one.I didn't care for the Matrix and thought Blade was a better movie.Matrix tried to do the same things ,but failed.The acting was pretty wooden,but when is it not in a Hollywood big budget movie.Some new faces that did well.Good action,nice flashy directing and good effects.I rate a 7.",7,0,1,6 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good....but lets not get ahead of ourselves!
","LOTR was a GOOD movie....not great...not tthe best of all time...or even the best of the year.It was visually exciting, but I agree with alot of you that it just simply got to be too long!It was also a little redundant with the Orc battles.We got the idea!The first 1/2 hour was kind of slow and the last half hour was slow....the 1 and 1/2 in between is where the action is.8/10",8,0,0,28 January 2002
Moulin Rouge!," WHY?
","That was the word i kept asking myself over and over throughout this 'film'.Why do the critics like it so much?Why did it make even as much money as it did?Why am I still sitting through this.This movie should have been a huge flop and would have years ago when good movies were made more often.Very little story,no character development.....Jeezz, they couldnt even think up their own songs!!!!!Kurt Cobain must be turning in his grave!!! Terrible 3/10....gave it 3 simply because it looked good and Ewan deserves credit for putting up with this schlock!!!!!",3,0,1,3 January 2002
Pi," I love independent film but.........
","I love independent film,but this film is terrible.Unless you are a math,engineering or philosophy major,you will have no interest in this film.I tried to like it,but the plot was WAY too confusing.Its all been done(alot better,mind you)in Lynch's ERASERHEAD.I give this fim a 2...simply because the soundtrack was good enough  to keep it from the lowest mark.Very pretentious amatuarish filmaking.",2,3,5,6 March 2001
Black Hawk Down," top three War movies of all time
","I loved the movie...I thought it showed the complete and utter horror of war.I dont know how some of you can say it was propaganda....Look up the word in the dictionary.Methinks Ridley should win (sorry David Lynch,but your movie made no sense!)Great war sequences...Why wasnt the nomintaed form best picture...Better than Saving Private Ryan!",10,0,0,18 March 2002
From Hell," Something missing.....
","I cant put a finger on it...good cast...fairly good screen play ( from a graphic novel) ...there is just something missing.There is a lull in the middle in which the movie never seems to recover.Depp is good as the investigator trying to solve the case,but he is not great.Ian Holm is a little over the top and Mary Kelley could have been played by any unknown.Some neat effects by the director..but as a whole,not really recommended.....6/10.",6,2,3,30 October 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," You can tell from the first twenty minutes that it was going to be a letdown
","I am a big fan of most of Stanley Kubricks work and there were flashes of his earlier greatness,but this movie was a truly BAD movie.The plot went no-where,Nicole Kidman was horrible and well,I was never a fan of Tom (everybody wants to have sex with me )Cruise.It was like an uphill bike ride the whole way through....waiting for something to happen...it never did!",1,6,11,18 July 1999
Vanilla Sky," 10
",I was enthralled the whole time....I loved it.....hard to pigeonhold.I never liked Tom Cruise or Cameron Crowe....but this movie was both of their peaks.How can people compare this to 'Jerry MaGuire'?As if that movie was really groundbreaking or well acted....Vanilla Sky takes us to a whole new world of film-making and is a must see for all music lovers!!! Cameron Diaz was also great in a very strange role.Good Stuff!,10,0,1,7 February 2002
The Thin Red Line," Poetic,artistic,haunting
","I compare this movie to Apocalypse Now.Some have compared it to Full Metal Jacket....I don't see the similarities there except for the fact that both movies are haunting.Apocalypse Now showed how the horrors of war drive men to madness....Thin Red Line took it even further.John Savage was a good example of the insanity.Nick Nolte was also insane in his gung ho attempts at furthering his career in the army.Good performances abound! The cinematography was excellent and very artistic.Like a painter using a canvas.Beutiful shots interspersed with disturbing ones.Sometimes,however the art got in the way of character development .Some shots that really stood out were the japanese mans face buried in the dirt and the tribes celebrating in the jungle.The score seemed to fit these scenes appropriately.Haunting,disturbing!9 stars out of 10!TL27",9,0,0,20 January 1999
Donnie Darko," An 80s homage
","I liked 'donnie Darko' .I give it a strong 8/10.Although I dont really thinks its all that groundbreaking or unique.I think it acts as a great homage to all of the great 80s blockbusters (ie. Back to the Future,Poltergeist,E.T. etc etc...the list goes on and on.) I guess it was going to be more subversive or something.I enjoyed the movie and I 'got' it,but lets not look into the movie TOO much.It was meant to be entertaining,not a philosophical debate!",8,0,0,25 June 2002
High Fidelity," half of this movie should have ended up on the editing room floor
",I cant believe this terrible movie is getting good reviews here! I give this movie a whopping 1 star.The pace and the editing were horrible.I couldnt care about any of these boring characters(especially John Cusack's).The female lead was a horrible actress.We wont be seeing more of her I can assure you.The only redeeming quality was Jack Black....and he was underused.,1,12,30,12 April 2000
