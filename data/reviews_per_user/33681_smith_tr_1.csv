Blade Runner 2049," Emperors new clothes . ( No spoilers )
","The movie looks fantastic and the acting is great , but , much as I really wanted this to be a worthy sequel I have to say it's a massive let down .Firstly ; It's horrifically misogynistic .I'm not some soft , leftist , hippy but I was uncomfortable watching this . It was like a throwback to the worst of the 70's .Secondly ; Scott's original featured a meticulously constructed world / society where everything felt 'real' because it had a reason for being that way . This movie , however , just seems to throw stuff in there to fill ( some ) of the plot holes or to reference the original and provide a feeling of familiarity .Thirdly ; a wiser person than I said ' a good film can't be too long and a bad film can never be too short ' . This film needs a much tighter edit . The original ( all versions ) came in at under 2 hours and still had plenty of time for lingering shots of owls , old photos , cities etc . Watching this movie felt like a chore at times.Finally ; Because I didn't want to write a review with spoilers I've not mentioned plot . I will say that the story is slight , as was the original's but it just feels as though the whole thing's there to provide an excuse for the movie to exist rather than having something profound to say about the nature of humanity .This movie left me feeling angry at a wasted opportunity , and then sad because I got angry and then sad because i was angry and sad etc",5,8,17,10 October 2017
