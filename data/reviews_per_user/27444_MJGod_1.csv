Saturday Night Fever," One of the Greatest
","Fifty years from now people will still be dancing to the soundtrack. There is something magical about it. Yes, the story was silly, racist, dumb, etc., but hearing those songs makes me feel like a kid again.The funny thing about this movie though, is the fact that John Travolta was the only big star to come out of the movie. Yes, there was Fran Drescher (but it definitely wasn't the movie that made her a star) and a few actors and actresses who have gone on to minor success, but where did everybody else go? Donna Pescow had a sitcom but that's about it.Nevertheless, I have seen SNF 100 times, and I'll see it again anytime it's on TV. I can never get tired of it.",10,0,2,9 April 2005
