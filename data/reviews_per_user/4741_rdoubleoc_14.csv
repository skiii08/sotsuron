Ford v Ferrari," I agree with other comments for once.
","I actually agree with some of the other comments, especially the one that says something along the lines of this movie putting my faith in the movie business again. I expected bad acting on at least one of the two star actors parts (Damon, Bale), but this movie is good. A little slow in the beginning, but that's my only complaint (I literally fell asleep during the beginning and woke up and watched the rest of this great movie).The race at the end is good, but moreso from an emotional standpoint than an action packed standpoint. I feel like they could've had a few extra scenes to 'wow' us at the end.",10,2,2,13 February 2020
The Blair Witch Project," Saw this in theatres, but wish I didn't.
","At the time, everyone was talking about this movie, so me and my parents went to see it. The movie wouldn't have been bad if something actually happened at the end, but it doesn't, which makes the whole movie seem pointless at the end. It's one of the worst movies, in my opinion.",3,2,3,3 May 2020
War Dogs," Awesome.
","These real life accounts of true stories lately in the movies is refreshing, especially since there's a lack of good movie content otherwise (in my opinion).Keep movies like this coming.",9,0,2,27 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Good movie, but not like I expected.
","Awesome soundtrack, and Brie Larson is a hottie.That being said, I really look forward to good new super hero origin stories, and was really looking forward to this one, but maybe that's why I thought it could be a little better. It's not a bad movie by any means, but just doesn't seem 'polished' enough for a 150 million dollar budget (75mil, or even 100mil, I could easily understand). I know things are expensive, but for that money I expected something a little more exciting and thrilling. This movie has very good parts, but it just isn't like Final Destination or Jurassic Park movies (with similar budgets) where certain parts would literally make your heart pulse faster and make you think 'Oh, geez... Wow. That's nuts!'. Cloaked space lab was cool, but that's the only unique/special plot element besides the cat? We've made people look younger before, even though maybe not that accurately. Captain Marvel is a cool superhero, nonetheless, maybe even one of my favorites.Fight scene during 'I'm Just a Girl' was pretty good.Good movie, but just isn't going to be one that I go and tell people about first thing tomorrow. Maybe I've been spoiled by Hollywood, but I just expected a little more for that kind of budget. Captain Marvel is one of my top favorite superheroes now, however.My top liked superheroes from Marvel:
1. Venom
2. Ant-Man
3. Captain Marvel2 and 3 are maybe a tie.",9,3,7,2 June 2019
Us," Very predictable and has been done before.
","Anything with souls or ghosts, I don't like, and this has soul stuff.The whole famly-doppleganger thing has been done before, but for some reason this movie acts like it hasn't been. I expected at least a new spin on the idea, but it didn't even give me that. They just thought they could shoot nice scenes in HD and people would automatically like it, it seems, not to sound rude, but it almost insults the intelligence of the audience. I mean, this is just like making another ghost movie where a ghost needs someone to perform some special act before they can pass on -- this idea isn't much better. The soul 'tethering' thing just seems like a bad/corny explanation for the events in the movie (why don't they just appear in a flash of lightning? Same thing).Again -- anything with souls or ghosts, I don't like, and this isn't any different.",1,3,4,18 June 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," A beautiful movie that at first seems like a cheap fictional-band comedy.
","I think my headline sums this movie up pretty good, but as a huge movie buff, I'd like to say a few things.I usually don't like comedies about fictional bands, even though Eurovision is a real contest, but this was good. Her Smell is an exception, and this is another, but I usually don't like movies of the 'Zoolander-type' (no offense to Zoolander).Rachel McAdams was the best person they could've got for this role. I'm literally trying to think of someone else who could've done an alright job, but just can't. After I saw Game Night, I think I wrote in my review for that movie that I thought they should use McAdams in more funny roles (since she was great in that), so it was a nice little surprise seeing her in this.The song for the contest is awesome. It's like 'Never Enough' in The Greatest Showman.The rest of the cast did an exceptional job as well, especially Pierce Brosnan and Will Farrell.I didn't even know about this movie until the day it came out, oddly enough. Netflix should really have a section that shows just the AAA movies they added since your last visit, since that's all I'm really interested in (big budget, polished, unique, movies like this).Along with Black Mirror, Unsolved Mysteries, and Disenchantment, and movies like this, Netflix has most of my favorite content now (HBO now comes in second place, in my mind -- they've been too hit-and-miss lately). At least when Netflix spends a lot on content, I usually love it.",10,2,3,2 July 2020
Knives Out," Yessssss MF'er!
","Sorry about the headline -- just got a little excited,
because you don't see these types of movies all the time, and if you do, they're usually cheaply made, or are not movies and are TV shows.The whole cast was great. Edi Patterson is getting more famous even though she has a small (but significant) part, and Daniel Craig actually does a good job acting with a southern accent. D. Johnson and M. Shannon also did their great usual acting jobs -- both very solid.The plot you'll never see coming -- I didn't. Just watch it. Everyone won't like it, but if you like mystery movies, you will.",10,3,6,26 February 2020
Aquaman," Not bad, but not an epic like Venom, either
","This movie is alright, but isn't really 'special' like Venom is. I know Venom and Aquaman are different universes, but just comparing it to a similar superhero-based movie from around the same time. I always thought Chris Hemsworth would make the best Aquaman, even though he's already Thor, but I guess this guy didn't do such a bad job. It is what it is, but it's not as 'epic' as I expected.",6,1,1,31 March 2019
Molly's Game," Sooooo good.
","Jessica Chastain is mesmerizing as the real life character she's based on. Great movie. Wish there were more like it. Inspires intelligence, also.",10,11,19,10 February 2019
Face_Off," One of the best action movies
","Definitely one of the best action movies, especially involving law enforcement, although fictional (at least currently). I'll never forget this movie, and Travolta and Cage's characters.",10,0,0,18 August 2019
The Fly," Holds up pretty well over time.
","It's 2020 while I'm writing this, and while I never saw this movie when it originally came out, I'm kind of glad I waited so I could see it with a fresh pair of eyes so late on.This movie holds up really well. They did such a good job on this that I wouldn't be surprised if people were still renting this in another 25-50 years. I'm amazed at how well they were able to make Goldblum transition from human to fly, even if the plot wasn't much better than the very old versions. The movie is an overall 10, even today (I would've paid money to rent this if I knew it was going to be this good, so thanks Starz).Gina Davis is a really good actor. Never saw her in anything other than A League of Their I, and might see what else she was in now.",10,0,0,3 May 2020
It Chapter Two," Actually, pretty good!
","I wasn't expecting this to be good since I didn't like the remake of the first part, even though I loved the original one in the 90s.Bill Hader, Chastain, and McAvoy make this a good film. I don't think it would be bearable without them.The 'truck-stop lumberjack' part made this gain one star by itself. That was way cool! Whoever thought of that had a great idea.",7,0,2,12 April 2020
Midway," People who dislike this need their head checked.
","This is a solid 10. I don't know how the battle of Midway actually was, but this is the best account I've personally heard of it, and definitely the most entertaining. Best $6 I spent all week.",10,1,4,23 April 2020
The Truman Show," Saw it as a kid.
","I saw this in theatres when it came out, but wanted to say what I thought anyway.I always felt this movie was a little on the boring side, but it'll always be a classic just because of the concept. I really think they should work on remaking this movie. They could sure do a lot with it today. I just remembered thinking 'Why did they not make all the cool parts they would today?' Maybe they were saving it for part 2, but that never came.",9,0,0,25 June 2019
