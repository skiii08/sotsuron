The Monuments Men," Great cast...not so much for the plot, but still very smart!
","I was kind of expecting lots of action, or a kind of huge/epic type thriller, but I was kind of disappointed with the slow speed and the total lack of suspenseful shots.Great cast, lot's of dialog and was not that witty or even interesting. Like I said the actors are first rate. but are really not used very well. Other people have said that Blanchett gets the show, but there is nothing to really steal from this, however I will say that the fact that Art was part of the plot was very smart.There were also 3 or 4 times where I was thinking that something crazy exciting was going to happen on screen, but the subject and action ended abruptly and the boring and easily dialogue was at it again.I still recommend the experience, since its more of a smart movie with great cast, just don't get fooled by the Army costumes, not much action hence the title.",9,0,0,14 November 2014
