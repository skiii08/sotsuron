Blade Runner 2049," Great movie for a movie buff
","The story line was complex, which is good for the serious viewer. Cinematography and the world setup was incredible. Gosling gives an Oscar level performance. The sound track was as good as the visuals. An excellent sequel to the first movie. It really moved the world to the next dimension. It was a little long. Watch for it at the Oscars",9,1,6,24 October 2017
