Black Swan," Good acting, bad plot
",After several euphoric reviews of this movie I was absolutely curious about it. But since the plot turned out to be a mix-up between a casting show and a bad horror movie I was rather disappointed. On the other hand the actors did a respectable job and the movie is 'a solid Hollywood production'. But by using this set of actors and a ballet setting they could've achieved a lot more if they'd tightened up the whole movie a bit - since the first half of the movie is just boring. Don't get me wrong - I do understand the characters in the movie have to be developed - but this was just all too obvious. MHO: not a bad movie - but not worth watching.,5,5,9,5 February 2011
Dead Poets Society," Carpe Diem (seize the day)!
","This movie has a real message-if you´re not watching movies for thinking about them, then check out another movie.But anybody that doesn´t run away after hearing the word 'poetry' and maybe likes movies that have a real intention should sit back and enjoy this excellent movie, and afterwards think about what it could mean to himself.'Respect to you, oh my captain, Peter Weir'",10,0,1,14 August 2001
Trainspotting," Shocking but excellent movie
","This movie is a real masterpiece, because it is as thrilling as an action movie and sometimes as realistic as a documentary.See it and be shocked about what happens to real people addicted to heroin, although it might even seem fun in the beginning of the movie.",Null,0,0,14 August 2001
