The Blair Witch Project," Very Frightening
","Some people hate this movie. Don't listen to them!I recently rented The Blair Witch Project because I am a big fan of scary movies. I loved it! It was creepy because it was so realistic. I know that by now, the 'camera held by character' idea has been done to death, but when this movie first came out, it was a very original idea.I'm not going to say anything about the ending, but I will say that it was very creepy.The only reason I'm giving this movie nine stars instead of ten is that it's a bit slow going near the beginning. But overall, I'm glad I watched it!",3,0,4,12 July 2009
"I, Robot"," Great science fiction that occasionally degenerates into an action movie
","I thought I, Robot had a very interesting plot. That is mainly why I like it so much. Being a fan of science fiction, including the original book by Isaac Asimov, I was hesitant to watch this because I had heard that the movie was not very much like the book. After I saw it, I was impressed. Yes, the plot of the movie and the plot of the book are different. But both of them are entertaining. I showed this movie to my dad (also a science fiction fan), and he thought it was excellent. The only reason I am giving this movie nine stars instead of ten is because it occasionally becomes an ordinary action movie (I don't like action movies), and because Shia LaBeouf's character seems useless in the movie. Overall, this is definitely one to check out if you like good, intelligent, thought-provoking science fiction.",9,0,1,27 July 2009
Donnie Darko," This one's a real mind-bender.
","This is easily the best thriller I have seen in a long, long time.The movie is about a psychologically unstable teenager named Donnie Darko who thinks he can see a six-foot rabbit named Frank. Not Harvey, Frank.The plot is too difficult to describe without revealing too much, so I won't go into it any further. But it will definitely stick in your mind for a long time.But one of the most interesting things I feel I should mention about this movie is that Donnie is the one who's supposed to be crazy, but in reality, he seems like the most normal one. Except for his family, his girlfriend, his English teacher, and his therapist, everybody surrounding Donnie is crazier than he is.You're never going to forget this movie after you see it. Why did they have to mar its good name with a sequel?",10,1,4,27 December 2009
