The Longest Yard," Just saw the movie and it is actually very good!
","Really enjoyed the movie! There is enough going on in the movie to keep you interested and its not all comedy, it gives you a little bit of drama as well! The football players were great and there are a lot of people in this from the original. Pay close enough attention if you saw the original you will be able to pick out who they are! Chris Rock is a scream, his one liners will have you rolling'! Courtney Cox had a brief role in the movie, I thought Sandler might have twisted the movie a little more to bring her back at the end but he didn't. You should definitely go see this movie if you are into football or like Adam Sandler's movies, you won't be disappointed!",9,3,8,29 May 2005
War of the Worlds," Decent but somewhat disappointed!
","As far as special effects go, it was pretty awesome! But the elements of the movie were pretty similar to Independence Day, if you have already seen both films you know what I am talking about, if you haven't seen War of the WOrlds(but saw ID) you will figure it out.Dakota Fanning was really good as the daughter, Tom Cruise was alright as Ray Ferrier but I expected more from him! Overall, the alien invasion and how the aliens did it was pretty freaky and plausible. Who knows what is out there watching us or even possibly walking among us. It makes you wonder, it makes you think if there are A.I's or E.T.'s out there, what are their intentions toward us? In this movie, I really expected a face to face confrontation between one of the lead characters and an alien that never happened. It would have been cool! Not recommended for kids under 9, it will freak them out! Good rental when it hits video.",7,0,1,17 July 2005
