Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It was very far from the reality
",It was better to choose an imaginary country for make all this jokes because Kazakhstan is a country with a lot of history and culture and they didn't deserve to introduce to the American public like this. Even though I'm not from Kazakhstan I found this movie very insulting and offensive.Kazakhstan has a very good air space and nuclear scientist. The movie shows Kazakhstan people are not familiar even with toilet and elevator. It is introducing people of Kazakhstan as people without moral principal.I found this movie very far from the reality,1,11,24,20 November 2006
