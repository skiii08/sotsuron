Antz," A new paradigm for animation
","As a committed animated movie fan, I found Antz to be an innovative departure.  The characters have a more 3 dimensional look to them, with a real feeling of 'roundness'.  The individuality theme is well explored, and the fact that each character strongly resembles its voice provider is a clever touch.  Dreamworks have found a formula which seems set to turn 'Toontown on its head, and I believe that a spate of similar movies will follow.  This is movie which will appeal to all age groups, but at different levels - from the purely WYSIWYG to those who will read deep meanings into it. Anarchists beware!  Dreamworks have your number!",8,0,0,15 November 1998
