The Rock," An incredibly exiciting,captivating Movie
","I think a fair way to sum up this film would be in one word:Brilliant.However, I think it, and you, the readers of this review deserve a slightly more comprehensive description than that. Firstly, a quick summary of the plot,without revealing too much: Ed Harris (Apollo 13) plays Francis Hummel, an ex General who wants to get back at the armed forces, because of the way they treat the kin of killed officers so poorly, and other things of similar sorts. To do this, he takes control of Alcatraz and keeps the visiters there hostage, threatening to also launch poison missiles at San Francisco. Two men, in particular, are relied upon to break into the Island and stop him. Firstly, chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed, played by Nicholas Cage(Gone in 60 Seconds,Face/Off). His job is to disarm the weapons. Secondly, John Mason, played by Sean Connery(The Untouchables,Entrapment). His job is too break in because he is the only man to ever have broken out.Of course, chaos ensues and what unfolds is a couple of hours of great action that is made even better with the special effects and expert production and direction. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who really is a genious with other titles like Armageddon, Enemy of the State,Top Gun and Gone in 60 Seconds to his name, pulls off another great, with the help of Don Simpson, who he worked with on Enemy of the State and Crimson Tide. Micheal Bay is once again very good as the director, as with Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, where he also worked with Bruckheimer. These three people, together with the cast already mentioned, have created a unique film that is very entertaining and great to look at, in terms of effects, and scale. The soundtrack is very dramatic and fitting as always with a Bruckheimer film. All in all, a wonderful film, that I don't think got all the applause it deserves.",Null,2,2,7 June 2002
Training Day," Absolutely cracking!!!
","The plot has already been discussed a thousand times on here, so I will not waste time describing it, but for a in a brief way: Denzel Washington (The Hurricane,The Bone Collector, Courage Under Fire) plays thirteen year LAPD veteran Alonzo Harris. The film follows a turbulent day as rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is taken under Harris's wing in a 'Training Day'. Pass the tough test he is presented with, and he becomes a narcotics officer, fail, and he goes back to the Valley. What unfolds is a carefully thought out and even more impressively executed plot, that has many turns along the way, and many underlying themes that can be appreciated more on repeated viewings. David Ayers' screenplay beats the hell out of his other two famous ones - The Fast and the Furious and U-571, and Antoine Fuqua's direction is some of the best work I have ever seen. Every scene has it's own significance, even if you only realise it later, and they are cut perfectly to display this.I have heard accusations on here of Denzel being 'bad in some scenes', and the supporting cast 'having nothing to do'. Let me clear that up with one word: Rubbish. Washington is on form for every second of screen time, showing us more and more of who he really is as the film goes along, but letting us judge for ourselves whether we like Harris or not, whether we agree with his principles or not. And as for the supporting roles, I would welcome anybody who can point out a scene in which actors are completely wasted. Scott Glenn (who also worked with Washington on Courage Under Fire) is solid as Harris's 'boy' Roger, and Cliff Curtis of Three Kings fame is a joy to watch as a Mexican nicknamed 'Smiley', even more so considering that he is a New Zealander and does his assigned accent perfectly. This film is brimming with talent, including the supporting cast. Although it recieved an Oscar for Washington's lead role, the whole film is virtually flawless. Hawke is fantastic as Jake Hoyt, and it's always good to see Tom Berenger pop up, even if its only for a few minutes. This film is well written, sharply directed, performed with distinction. The musical score from Mark Mancina deserves a mention too. And as for the so called 'disappointing' ending, it really isn't. It caps off the whole feel of the film: Firstly, because it has ((Slight Spoiler)) Harris showing his true colours that have been coming out bit by bit all the way through. Secondly, because after the great (((((Spoiler)))) 'King Kong' speech, the film is finished off in the same vein as the rest of it, with subtlety. It leaves room for interpretation, and, like throughout, it  doesn't over do on emotion. An original, gritty, and refreshing look at a side of street life you don't often see portrayed so well.A well deserved 10/10",Null,0,11,8 March 2003
Pulp Fiction," Shamelessly explicit, but genius
","The fact that this is one of the most acclaimed movies by both critics and audiences alike, worldwide, is no coincidence. The content of this film is shocking- one man's vision of the many different aspects of petty criminals lives in Los Angeles. Quentin Tarantino doesnt pull his punches and in both this and Reservoir Dogs, he portrays a very realistic view of gritty world, not worrying about excessive amounts of bad language, some graphic violent scenes, and even drug use. The magic of Tarantino is that he manages to couple this with a great, fast moving script, and a well thought out plot, that he executes perfectly. So not only do you feel that what you are watching is probably pretty close to reality, but it is irrestibly entertaining aswell. Pulp Fiction is really one story, following Vincent Vega(John Travolta)and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson), as they have a hectic couple of days at the office, working for crimelord Marsellus Wallace. But it is told in three shorter sections that,combined together, tell the tale. The good thing is that you have to follow quite closely to get the best out of the movie, and afterwards take a couple of seconds to sort the scenes you have seen into the correct order that they happened. It's not really hard or complicated, but makes the film more interesting than if it were a beginning-middle-end story. The way that Tarantino executes this, both in the script and the actual film itself, is deserving of all the accolades he recieved. Of course, the thing that carries the film, along with the script, is the fantastic acting by one of the best casts I have ever seen. Backing up Travolta and Jackson are: Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Kietel, Bruce Willis,Uma Thurman,Eric Stoltz,Tarantino Himself,Amanda Plummer, and fans of Reservoir Dogs, (like me), will be pleased to see Steve Buscemi make a small appearance as a waiter dressed up as Buddy Holly. Everything about this film is enjoyable, unless you are easily offended, and it deserves a lot of credit.",10,1,2,30 December 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Deserves all the credit it gets- absolutely AMAZING
","Frank Darabont is a genius. In one of the most critically acclaimed, famous movies in Hollywood history, the director from France has created a work of art. Superb performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the film throughout its fairly lengthy duration of 137 minutes smoothly. The film has a very slow pace, but somehow it is incredible absorbing, not boring in the slightest. The story follows Andy Dufresne, (Tim Robbins), a young banker who, despite protesting innocence, is jailed with back to back life sentences for killing his wife and her lover that she ran away with. Once at Shawshank Prison, he developes a friendship with Ellis Boyd Redding- 'Red' (Morgan Freeman). Red is a man who 'knows how to get things', i.e  he smuggles things in from the outside world. What unfolds is not what you might expect- it's not the kind of prison film that has a gritty, explicit view of the bad things that happen in prison. Whilst this is shown to a certain extent, its not as bad as it could be and the bad sides generally come from the corrupt screws rather than the cons. This is a moral tale, as suggested by the tagline 'Fear can hold you prisoner....hope can set you free'. It's the kind of film that you can enjoy immensely, watch again and again, and really take a message about life away from. My favourite film, along with Pulp Fiction of the same year, I give it 10/10",10,1,1,18 January 2003
Speed," Amazing action film.
","I will start off by saying that I watch movies both for entertainment and from a critical,thoughtful point of view. This is definitely an entertaining movie, but it stands up critically aswell. I watch virtually any genre of film, but action is one of my favourites. And this is my favourite action movie. Despite my high regard for Die Hard, I think this is better. It succeeds in so many ways. Firstly, the plot: Well, its pretty damn simple, but in this case thats a good thing. A guy has rigged a bus so that if it goes above 50 MPH a bomb is armed and if it drops below that speed again, it blows. I have heard much criticism of this being unrealistic, but I don't see why. Think about the amount of destruction modern technology can cause today, and it seems plausible. Another guy, a cop, is trying to stop the worst from happening by boarding the bus. The Actors/ Characters: Keanu Reeves is excellent and likeable as LAPD officer Jack Traven, the type that fears nothing and will do anything ,no matter how dangerous. Dennis Hopper is the ex - cop that has rigged the bus. This is an incredible performance. In my opinion,in terms of action films, the best bad guy ever and one of the finest pieces of completely addictive acting in any type of film ever. Sandra Bullock is Annie, a normal woman that ends up driving a bus haphazardly through busy city steets at 55 MPH - and she was originally worried about being late for work!! I don't know if she is like this in real life, but if she is, she must get annoying. I don't like this character very much because she screams stupid things and repeats herself all the way through the film. Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels are solid as Jack's superior Mac and his partner Harry. As for the action sequences- they are thrilling, like many people have said, because they are real. They don't rely on special effects at all. And that means they are much more exciting. You are kept on the edge of your seat throughout and that feeling doesn't falter - I have seen this movie LOADS of times and it still excites me in a big way. It really does grip you. This is partly thanks to the fantastic score by Mark Mancina. This makes sure that even if the action starts to bore you, which is unlikely, you are still captivated. The scores' only flaw is that a certain bit of music gets a bit repetitive after a while. In conclusion, this film is a cracking, thrilling, exhilirating rollercoaster ride of an action movie, that has yet to be equalled. As a piece of entertainment, its brilliant. From a critical perspective, it has only a few minor flaws - i.e Sandra Bullocks infuriating screaming and a few quotes that are very tin - eared and unnatural, which is a shame because what makes this film so great is that the action IS natural, as oppose to obviously CGI. The film fanatic in me loves this film, The critic applauds it. 9 and a 1/2 out of 10.",9,1,2,29 June 2003
