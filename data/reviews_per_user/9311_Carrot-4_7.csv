Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, because it's Star Wars...
","I can't say that I didn't enjoy it but a lot of things could have been changed. First, Jake Lloyd, bad choice, he was just bad, he was annoying and not even cute. Next, okay, I know, it is all computer made, who cares, we don't need an endless pod racing scene or useless computer animated characters to prove it and Jar Jar, shut the fudge up. Finally, I think it was a little too made-for-kids.Okay, that's enough bitching. Now for the good parts. I liked the movie because of what Star Wars is. To me, Star Wars is light sabers fights and intense moments between good and evil, that is the memory I keep from when I was watching Star Wars the first time when I was about eight. For these reasons, I liked the movie and I think that as a part of a trilogy it is going to be good.",4,0,1,23 April 2000
The Patriot," Watch out Jim Carrey, this is the comedy of the summer !!!
","Very funny movie. I thought the idea of a man who has done some bad things in the past even though he is good was brilliant. Gibson gives a dark yet sarcastic look at that character which gives the movie a weird comic twist. Jason Isaacs is great in the role of the bad guy, he is so Machiavellian he made me think of Dr. Evil. And let us not forget Heath Ledger who brings us back to back laughs with his sweet performance. But perhaps the funniest moment of the film belongs to Lisa Brenner when she tells people to join the army, I was laughing my guts out in the theater.Overall very humorous film but maybe a little too long... what's that you say... a drama... get outta here...!",4,0,1,29 June 2000
Saving Private Ryan," WAR
","This movie is a masterpiece of direction, the landing scene is one of the best scenes in the history of movie making. But, let's not get carried away. Now, let me tell you what this movie is all about.The whole thing about saving a private whose brothers have all been killed isn't at the root of this story, it is just a pretext to put some men in life or death situations and see how they react. The whole movie is a metaphor of WAR, all wars. Wars are used to have more lands, more power. Thousands, millions of men die in a war to please these people who want these lands or this power. In the movie, men fight and die for something that seems so insignificant: the life of one man. All these men get slaughtered for that ONE thing that is so important for some but seems so stupid to us. So, The movie is in fact a transposition of war in a context where we know all of the characters so that we don't see a man who dies just as a simple private but as a human being. I think that was the only way to show us all the horror of WAR itself, and I think Spielberg knew that.",9,0,0,21 December 1999
Dog Day Afternoon," Superb!
","Definitely the best movie about bank robberies. This movie is very complex and deals not only with the issue of robbing banks but with the prejudices that people carry. The direction of the movie is based on a tense atmosphere that never stops till the ending credits. This is Sidney Lumet's masterpiece, he came close to it with 'Serpico' but it wasn't as good as this one.",10,2,4,23 December 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," One of the 10 best movies of the decade.
","Being a huge fan of Kubrick, I was expecting this movie to be a great one and, I really wasn't disappointed at all. This movie is a very complicated and weird one with strange twists and a great psychological evolution for each one of the two main characters. Tom Cruise is pretty good and Nicole Kidman is great in her role but, what is important to remember is that, this movie is a Stanley Kubrick movie and therefore, is not accessible for everyone. If you are expecting your average movie where all the answers are given or if you don't want to think about what is going on, don't see this movie. But, if you're in the market for an interesting psychological drama with great cinematography and a good script, then, see this movie. That is all I've got to say....",10,2,3,18 July 1999
The Descent," And the acting saves the day!
","Like I do all the time when I hear about a new independent horror film that has critics and festival-goers amazed, I got my hopes up.In this one, a group of British girls looking for kicks go caving in new-england and they have a great time until they start being hunted by cave-monsters. As you can see, the premise isn't too original but, hey, we're talking horror film here. The problem here isn't the premise, it's pretty much everything else; first, the movie takes it's time to start, now, usually that doesn't bother me, actually i like it when you get to know and like the characters before they get ripped apart, but they only really develop 2 of the characters so, when people start dying, it's like free gory deaths but you don't actually feel for the characters. Also, the fact that the movie is set in a pitch black environment could have been a real plus but after you see the first 3 or 4 monsters, you start seeing them all the time and really take a good look at them so, after a while they're not really scary anymore not even creepy, just gross. The only moments you're not sure of what you're seeing is during action/fight scenes, which is quite annoying. The techniques used to scare you are pretty lame too, like the 'I'll make you jump so many times you'll have to be scared' and the 'pan to the left, then pan to the right, then to the left, then to the right, then to the left and BOOM! Big Scary Monster!' and so on. The last 15 minutes didn't make much sense to me either it just seemed like 'Rambo vs. the Cave-Monsters: The All Girl Version' with a twist ending that wasn't necessary at all.So, what did I like? Well, apart from the acting, not much, but the acting was definitely great, kudos to all the girls for pulling this one off because they really save the film. Really, I must say, the mood wasn't very good, the action either, but the acting WOW! Subtle, always on the mark, no useless girly screaming, no overacting, great panicking... Seriously, I hope you girls read this comment to make yourselves feel better because I AM AMAZED! So, in 25 words or less: like Aliens underground with an all girl cast without guns with less budget and not as good... so, not really like Aliens after all...",6,3,6,21 June 2006
Titanic," Overestimated, then underestimated...
","Titanic is a very good movie and a wonderful love story but, along the way, something happened, people got all carried away and started saying it was the best movie of all times. Then the publicity started to become more and more present and then the Oscars (11 for those who might not already know), more publicity and it kept on going. People got tired to hear about it and started saying it wasn't that good and even that it was bad (I even said it, I'm not proud). Now, this movie isn't the best movie ever but you can't deny the fact that it is well directed, well written, well played, not boring and thus, that it is a pretty good film.",7,1,2,21 December 1999
