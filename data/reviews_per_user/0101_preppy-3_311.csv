The Blair Witch Project," Over-hyped
","This is a VERY low-budget horror film that was WAY over-hyped! It's about three college students who go into the woods for a weekend to see if the legend of the Blair Witch is real. They film themselves all weekend long. Then they get lost, run low on food and water and some REAL spooky things happen...The moments when they're hearing noises and voices in the dark are VERY scary (especially somebody calling them from a distance). But that's it. There's nothing inventive plot wise, the characters are REAL annoying (Heather was particularly annoying--she never shut up!) and the camera-work made me seasick. Also all the horror in this is implied and never shown. There's nothing wrong with that but add that with the above ingredients and you got a very exasperating film. Basically I was never scared once...but I was bored a LOT! Also what's all this hype about the 'incredible' ending? The ending was telegraphed at least a half hour before it happened! I really don't like this film, but I think it's because of the nonstop hype on it. You might like it, but set your expectation on low.",1,16,38,1 November 1999
Saturday Night Fever," Great movie with a pulsating soundtrack
",Tony Manero (John Travolta) is in his early 20s. He lives in Brooklyn with his parents (who treat him like dirt) and has a dead-end job. He blows off steam every Saturday by going to a disco with his immature buddies. He's also GREAT at dancing. One night there he meets Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) and falls in love. However she's ambitious and is moving forward. He isn't. Can their love survive?This was a HUGE hit in 1977. It made disco popular and made Travolta a star. There's tons of swearing (in the R rated version) but that's how guys that age talk. It moves quickly and has a compelling story. With the exception of Gorney all the acting is good. Travolta is superb! His acting is great and his dancing is beyond belief. Also the soundtrack (primarily by the Bee Gees) is wonderful. It's actually a pretty dark movie but the acting and soundtrack make you forget all that. A true must-see movie.,10,0,2,1 February 2018
The Avengers," Great comic book motion picture
","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gets together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to battle Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is planning to invade Earth with a full army to rule the world.This has been praised by everybody and it's easy to see why--it's GREAT! There's an intelligent sharp script, virtual non-stop action, incredible special effects and 2 1/2 hours that just fly by. This one of those rare comic book movies where everything is done right! It's beautifully directed, the acting is good, there's nice doses of humor and (refreshingly) the characters do NOT get along at first so we can see them grow and become a team. There's not a lot to say about this film because EVERYTHING is done well! Just go see it and enjoy! Also stay through the closing credits for a very humorous bit at the very end.",9,4,13,21 May 2012
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Camp classic
","Three drag queens take a road trip from Sydney to mid-Australia to perform on stage. Also, one of them has a secret that's revealed at the end. Nothing new plot-wise, but it has a fantastic soundtrack (Gloria Gaynor, the Village People, Charlene, etc.), unbelievable costumes (a deserved Academy-Award winner) and three great performances. Hugo Weaving is good, Terence Stamp is excellent as a transsexual--this couldn't have been an easy role, but he pulls it off. Guy Pearce is absolutely gorgeous as the youngest of the bunch. Also, there are more than a few scenes of him shirtless or parading around in his little Calvin Kleins--definitely worth seeing (I know he's straight, but I can dream can't I?). Also the bitchy banter is funny (if occasionally too caustic) and they don't ignore homophobia and, at the end, present a little boy who is totally comfortable with his dad being a drag queen and his mother bisexual (it's suggested). Also, back in 1994 this helped me get over a very painful breakup. If you're gay, you've got to see it. One of the best gay films of all time.",9,6,11,2 October 2000
Black Swan," Good acting can't save this one
","Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) wins the lead in a production of Swan lake led by tyrannical director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel). After she wins the lead things slowly become stranger and stranger with another ballerina named Lily (Mila Kunis) seemingly trying to take her place. It all comes to a head on the opening night.**SPOILERS!** Boring and disappointing 'thriller' from director Darren Aronofsky. It was ridiculously obvious to me what was going on within the first 20 minutes! The rest of the movie just shows Nina slowly (VERY slowly) spiraling down to madness. The imagery was sometimes shocking but, towards the end, I was bored and couldn't wait for it to end. WAY too much ballet material too. Aronofsky gives plenty of clues to point that Nina is losing it--but then ends leaving a ridiculously large number of dangling ends. Even worse, I was never caught up in Nina's plight keeping me at an emotional distance from the whole movie. Good acting helps a little. Portman is kind of blank (but there's a reason for that) until the end when she breaks out. Cassel is just vicious as her director, Kunis is great as her best friend (or is she?), Barbara Hershey (looking TERRIBLE) is great as her mom and a virtually unrecognizable Winona Ryder throws in a small but strong performance. But the movie as a whole is too obscure, too slow and (frankly) too boring! I give it a 2.",2,13,43,1 January 2011
Changeling," Harrowing but great
","This movie is a true story. It takes place in 1928 Los Angeles. Single mom Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) comes home from work one day to find her 8 year old son missing. Nobody has seen him. She calls the LAPD and they mount a search. Five months later they find the boy...but it's not her son. He says he is and the police tell her to lie and go along with them. She tries to fight back and things get very disturbing.SPOILER WARNINGS Bleak and disturbing but a powerful true movie about police corruption. It ultimately does have a happy ending (sort of) but the middle section is pretty strong stuff. Collins is institutionalized and her treatment there is beyond belief. Also murder and child abuse come up later on. Trust me--this film is VERY R rated. The 1920s are captured perfectly on film in all terms. Also the acting is just great across the board. However Jolie (in an Oscar nominated performance) is just incredible. She keeps most of her reactions and emotions bottled up but you can see the fear and anger in her face. When she finally explodes near the end it REALLY hits! There are also standout performances by Eddie Alderson (as Sanford Clark), Amy Ryan (as Carol Dexter) and Jeffrey Donovan (as J.J. Jones). It is too long and rather slow but a story like this can't be told quickly. It gives you time to understand the characters and situations. Dark but powerful. An 8.",8,2,4,20 November 2009
Love and Death," One of Allen's best
","Hysterical spoof on Tolsty, the Russian Revolution and Russian literature (with Igmar Bergman thrown in!).  Movie has Allen as a Russian man (!!!) who is a coward (of course) and is sent off to fight in the revolution.  He also falls in love with Diane Keaton who only loves him as a friend. 
The film looks incredible--beautiful, lush settings and some truly beautiful costumes--I've never seen another Allen film that looks this good.  Also a wonderful music score that totally fits the picture.  I believe this is probably the first (and only) Allen film with not one shot in NYC (it was filmed on location in Hungary). The film is side-splitting--the jokes fly fast and furious and there are many more hits than misses and the film moves at lightning speed.  There are way too many highlights to mention, but my particular favorites are the Keaton/Allen intellectual discussions and Jessica Harper (looking fantastic) giving a very funny monologue at the end.A definite must-see!",10,1,2,4 October 2002
Gremlins," Funny, entertaining, scary and NOT for children
","Possible spoilers ahead...I loved this film when it first came out and now, 16 years later, it still holds up. The performances range from very good (Polly Holliday, Frances Lee McCain) to OK (everybody else). The special effects are superb, Gizmo is soooooo cute, the movie is never dull and there are tons of references for film buffs (like me). BUT it is NOT for children. I remember seeing it on opening night back in 1984, and when the evil gremlins attacked and the violence got real extreme (the mother killing three of them in a blender, microwave and knife), I still remember mothers dragging screaming, terrified children out of the theatre. There's also an extremely morbid Christmas tragedy that Phoebe Cates relates and people are killed--on screen! If they had toned down the violence and avoided killing people (injuring would have been fine) this would be a great film for everybody. As it is, it is a great film...for junior high on up. Also, when the gremlins invade the bar would someone explain where they got all those little clothes and how they knew how to play cards, drink beer, break dance, etc etc. Also there's a gremlin in the school that kills a teacher, slashes Zach Galligan...and then is forgotten! There are plenty of logic lapses in the script, but it's still worth seeing. Deserves an R rating, not a PG.",7,1,3,22 September 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant but very disturbing
","A chronicle of four people (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connolly and Ellen Burstyn) and their drug addictions and what it does to their lives. Starts off OK but becomes darker and more disturbing as it goes along. It ends with a montage showing what happens to all four of them--this sequence contains some of the most harrowing imagery I've ever seen in a film. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see it again--it's that graphic! Still, see the film. Leto is OK; Wayans is (surprisingly) pretty good; Connolly is excellent--I've never liked her until now; and Burstyn is simply superb--a sure Oscar winner if I ever saw one. Well, worth seeing but very disturbing. Unfortunately, this film has an NC-17 rating. That's too bad--it should have an R rating so high school kids could see it. This would turn them off drugs for good!",8,7,14,15 November 2000
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," WAY too slow
",The continuing 'Twilight' saga. Bella (Kristen Stewart) marries vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) against the objections of werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lauter). They go on a honeymoon and Bella gets pregnant. However this seems to be a vampire baby and is growing quickly and killing her....and it seems no one can help her. Jacob vows vengeance against Edward.The main problem with this movie is that it moves too damn SLOW! I read the book (which is terrible) so I know how this ends...and there is NO reason to drag this out to two movies. It could have easily been done in 2 and a half or three hours. This is just a studio squeezing the audience for as much money as it can. There are at least EIGHT music montages which add nothing to the movie. One has Stewart staring blankly at the camera (which is her only expression anyways) the whole time! To make it worse the dialogue is terrible and boring. Also Lautner and Stewart seem to be in a competition over who can be a worse actor. Lautner wins by a very small margin. Those two are TERRIBLE! Their faces never change expression at all! On the plus side it is well-directed and the wedding sequence is great. All the actors and actresses who play the Cullens or the werewolves are good and Booboo Stewart is especially good as Seth. The special effects are OK but the talking wolves looked pretty silly and the big fight between vampires and werewolves is shot in darkness and with TONS of quick cutting so you can barely see what is happening! All in all this is a pretty bad movie-way too slow and filled with bad acting and dialogue. Even Twilight fans hate this one. A 1.,1,3,8,26 November 2011
The Sound of Music," One of the best musicals ever made
","Based on a real life story. This takes place in Salzburg, Austria in 1939. Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) needs a governess to help control his seven children whose mother has died. The captain is VERY stern and treats his children like slaves. Maria (Julie Andrews) a nun is hired for the job. She quickly tames the children and has them singing. She even gets through to the captain. However he is engaged to be married to an evil Baroness (Eleanor Parker) who just wants him for his money.Beautiful scenery, great songs and a wonderful performance by Andrews. Sure it's syrupy and TOO sweet but I find it irresistible. The three hours just fly by whenever I see it. Andrews is wonderful and all the kids are OK. Parker does what she can in the evil woman role. The only real debit here is Plummer. He didn't want to do it and that comes through loud and clear. He called it 'The Sound of Mucus' and complained about his singing voice being dubbed. So his performance is bad but it doesn't ruin the movie.All in all I LOVE this movie and heartily recommend it. Best part: Peggy Wood as the Mother Abbess belting out 'Climb Every Mountain'.",10,5,6,5 May 2018
Ali," Muddled
","Pic follows Muhammed Ali from 1964 to 1974 chronicling his winning the heavyweight championship, losing it and winning it again. This could have been good, but it fails in so many ways.For starters, Will Smith is totally miscast as Ali--Ali was handsome, full of life and charismatic--Smith is none of those things. When he shouts out Ali's rhymes he comes off like a loudmouth jerk--he totally lacks Ali's sing-song voice and great personality. His face is always blank all during the film--even the fight scenes! No depth of character comes through. Also (although I realize this is a matter of opinion) Smith is ugly--Ali wasn't. All in all he's not a good enough dramatic actor to carry the film.The script is lousy--very scattershot. It jumps all over the place and characters appear and disappear at a disturbing rate. For instance...Ali meets his second wife at a religious meeting. They just hold hands. The very next scene they're married, have a house AND a baby girl!Michael Mann's direction doesn't help. It's constantly in closeups of the character's faces. This makes sense during the boxing scenes...you're right in there in the ring. But when it's constant it gets very annoying...especially at 160 minutes.And the film is way too long. Two hours and forty minutes is overdoing it. The only good thing about this is all the actors (except for Smith) are great in their roles--especially Jon Voight doing a dead on impersonation of Howard Cosell. And the fight scenes are good.But this isn't worth seeing. If you want a good boxing movie rent 'Raging Bull' or even 'Rocky'.",4,2,4,14 January 2002
Skyfall," It's OK
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is back and the organization he works for is under full attack. The head of it M (Judi Dench) is asked to step down. Bond tries to help her regain her job and go after villain Silva (Javier Bardem) who is targeting the agency and revealing the identities of double agents.This has gotten very mixed reviews and it's easy to see why. The plot is kind of vague to put it mildly. I (at first) thought Craig was wrong for the role but I do have to admit he's very good here. Dench is good also as M, there's Naomi Harris as Eve Moneypenny (a new character) and it's always good to see Ralph Fiennes in anything. There is plenty of action and this movie is back to the incredible old stunts of the original Bond films (after the overly serious 'Carino Royale' and 'Quantum...') and a title song sing by Adele. All in all it was well-done...but I really didn't like it. There are CONSTANT references to Bond and M as being too old for their jobs. Is this how we're supposed to celebrate Bond's 50th anniversary? There are plot loopholes galore--I still can't figure out how Silva knew where Bond was at the end. At the end the plot completely derails and it turns into 'Wuthering Heights'--with plenty of action and explosions:) Even worse is Bardem as Silva. He is a very good actor but he's all over the place in this role. He seems unsure of what exactly he's doing and (for some reason) almost sexually seduces Bond at one point. The movie is far too long also. So--an OK addition--nothing more.",7,1,12,12 December 2012
Ghost," Great romantic horror comedy
","Sam (Patrick Swayze) loves Molly (Demi Moore). They're mugged one night and Sam is accidentally killed. However his spirit is still around but no one can see or hear him. Then he meets Oda Mae Brown (Whoppi Goldberg) who can hear him but not see him. Then he discovers his killing was a set-up and Molly might be in danger.Swayze and Moore are just OK in their roles but Goldberg is great and won an Oscar here. Also the story is tight, complex and full of humor and action. Also great special effects. A HUGE hit when it came out. Also the ending--happy as it is--always has me crying. A must-see.",9,3,3,1 September 2019
The Ring," Creepy but not totally satisfying
","A Seattle newspaper reporters (Naomi Watts) cousin dies seven days after watching a video.  The video contains grainy, weird, frightening images and, after viewing it, you get a phone call saying 'seven days'.  Seven days later, you die.  Watts hears this but doesn't believe it.  She gets a copy of the tape, views it, then the phone rings...The plot is intriguing (and based on a 1998 Japanese film).  Also the movie takes itself very seriously and there's (thankfully) no stupid comic relief. Also Watts gives a powerhouse performance as does David Dorfman playing her really creepy little son.  There's no gore, very little blood and the scares are mostly quiet ones.  I usually love horror movies like that.  This one just misses the mark.The plot is way too intelligent for its own good (I got confused by the end).  It throws in a very frightening twist at the end that I didn't buy at all, and leaves lots of loose ends hanging.  Still, for 99% of the way, it works.  It's worth seeing just for that.",8,4,8,4 November 2002
It," Starts slow but ends with a bang
","Movie takes place in Bangor ME in 1989. A bunch of outsiders at a local school are menaced by Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). He's a supernatural being that appears as a clown and sucks the life out of children feeding on their fears. They fight back but are they strong enough to win? The movie starts off too slowly. It focuses on the kids and their miserable home lives. It moves slow, is full of unpleasant characters and has mediocre acting. Then the second hour starts and things kick into high gear. The pace gets quicker, the blood violence and gore kick in (and barely stop) and it really works. However the main issues here are the slow start and the mediocre acting by the kids. Only Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh is any good. Also Skarsgard is good as Pennywise but Tim Curry was better in the TV miniseries. So it's good but can't beat the TV version.",7,5,10,13 September 2017
Casablanca," Very good...but no classic
","This takes place in the town of Casablanca in Morocco. During the war hundreds of Americans were kept there trying to get VISAs or letters of transit to get to Lisbon and out of Europe. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a cafe in Casablanca and gets two stolen letters of transit. Then an ex love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) arrives there with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). They need the letters to escape from the Nazis who are slowly getting in...but will Rick give them up? This movie is well made, beautifully directed and has some of the most quotable lines in movie history--'I stick my neck out for nobody'; 'Play it Sam' (NOT play it again Sam); 'The Germans wore gray, you wore blue'; 'We'll always have Paris'; 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine'; 'Here's looking at you kid'; 'Round up the usual suspects' and 'Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. We also have Dooley Wilson playing and singing the haunting 'As Time Goes By'. The acting is superb across the board right down to the supporting performances-- Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet and Claude Rains are at their best.BUT I find the story somewhat confusing and there are some huge loopholes if you examine the movie closely. People who love this film just say that they're a small price to pay because everything else is so good...but they bothered me. I'm giving it an 8 and I recommend it but I don't think it's one of the best movies ever made.",8,3,9,25 November 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Yeah it looks great but...
","This movie takes place in 1947 in an imaginary world where cartoons are alive. Roger Rabbit is framed for killing somebody. Down and out detective Bob Hoskins is hired to find out who did it.This movie has a lot going for it. Virtually every cartoon character in existence (up till 1947) puts in an appearance. The animation is superb and the mix of live action with it is seamless. The movie starts off with a Looney Toons type cartoon--but sped up FAST! Also Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is VERY interesting to watch. This film is purportedly an allegory on how blacks were treated in 1940s Hollywwod--all the 'toons' here are servants or waiters and all live in a separate section of town. There are also a ton of inside jokes. I liked it--but not completely.Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy give terrible performances--but the script WAS against them and they were basically reacting to nothing. Roger Rabbit himself was a VERY annoying character--I could care less what happened to him. The storyline was vague and more than a little confusing--it kept coming to a screeching halt countless times when a 'toon' made a cameo. No characterizations either--the cartoons are more 3-dimensional than the humans! The script also thinks it's more clever than it actually is.I didn't like this much when it came out in 1988--it was a MONSTER hit. My feelings haven't changed much. Still--a lot of people liked this and kids will love it. Use your own judgment. For the animation and live action mix alone I give it a 7.'I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.'",7,5,9,19 February 2006
Minority Report," Surprisingly good
","I was going to avoid this movie.  The combination of Tom Cruise (a lousy actor) and Steven Spielberg (a lousy director) sounded hellish.  But all the good reviews got me interested, so I saw it.  And it wasn't bad!The story (for a Spielberg film) was complex, the direction was good and the film was done in washed out color.  Cruises performance was again lousy (no shock there), but everybody else was great...especially Farrell.  The film does have bad things...it's too long, the grimy look wears you down and it does have a happy ending which I didn't buy for one second.  But it's still pretty good.  Also there are incredible special effects (especially those creepy robot spiders...brrrrrrr).Worth catching even if you hate Spielberg and Cruise.",7,1,6,20 July 2002
Chinatown," Depressing but complex and riveting
","A murder mystery set in 1930s Los Angeles. Jack Nicholson plays a private detective named Jake Gittes. Evelyn Mulwray hires him to discover if her husband is cheating on her. What starts off as a simple cases quickly snowballs into an intricate and complex scheme involving a mysterious and possibly deadly woman (Faye Dunaway) and her very rich father Noah Cross (John Huston).I caught this originally at a revival theatre in the mid 1980s. I was fascinated but the downbeat ending depressed me incredibly. I've seen it multiple times since then. I STILL think the ending is not necessary (screenwriter Robert Towne complained a lot that director Roman Polanski changed his happy ending into a horrifying one) but I find the entire movie fascinating. It catches the 1930s perfectly down to the clothes, the houses, the cars--everything. The script is very involved--you have to pay strict attention or you'll miss some of the many twists. The script deservedly won an Academy Award. The acting is just great--Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston are just perfect in their roles. It runs over two hours but I was never once bored. The cinematography and music just add to the 1930s mood. Also this was the last film Roman Polanski directed in the USA before leaving to avoid being jailed on rape charges. Beautifically directed, acted and shot. A 10 all the way.",10,1,3,29 March 2009
Rocketman," Great musical
",Musical that chronicles the life and times of Elton John (Taron Egerton). It also gets into his relationships with his best friend (Jamie Bell) and manager (Richard Madden). It's sort of an average biographical film but then people start singing and dancing out of nowhere. It's strange at first but I got into it completely. It's never boring and all the singing and dancing is great. Naturally they do only Elton John songs. Also they don't ignore the fact that John is gay. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' barely deals with Freddie Mercury being gay but this one (thankfully) shoves it in your face. There's a fairly explicit gay sex scene which is a first for a major Hollywood film.The acting is great. Egerton is just great and his singing sounds just like John. Bell is equally good as his best friend. Madden looks terrible and is just OK as his manager. All in all it's a strange film and not for everybody--two people walked out when I saw it--but I loved it and was fascinated. A 10 all the way.,10,3,6,10 June 2019
To Be or Not to Be," Excellent comedy
","1939: the Nazis invade Poland.  Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) and his theatrical troupe fight them.  That's the bare bones--there's a lot more but see the movie to find out.  A very intricate, funny script and excellent performances keep this going.  Benny is funny in the lead, but Carole Lombard is letter-perfect as his wife.  Also it's fun to see Robert Stack so young and handsome with gleaming white teeth as a lieutenant helping them. Some may find it hard to laugh at considering the subject matter (the film was a bomb in 1942), but it works.",10,3,8,30 January 2001
Erin Brockovich," Nothing new plot-wise but compelling
","Even though this is based on a true story, it goes through the same hoops other movies of this kind have gone through.  One person finds big corporation being evil...battles against seemingly unsurmontable odds to beat them.  Every cliche is hit head on.  Still it's well worth seeing.  All the acting is great (especially Finney and Roberts), the script is razor sharp, the film moves briskly and the direction is very good and assured. Basically a familar story, but told very well.  Well worth seeing.  Also, Roberts fake breasts are something else!",8,1,4,11 April 2000
Se7en," Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching
","Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9,2,2,14 February 2008
Unbreakable," Unbearable is more like it.
","Spoiler ahead!!!!! Very slow, boring, pointless tale about a man (Willis) who is the sole survivor of a train wreck. He's contacted by another man who is born with bones that break easy (Jackson) and is told by him that they they are alike--just on opposite ends of the spectrum. There! I've just saved you 1 hour and 45 minutes of tedium. The story has no ending, no point at all and bores you to death by drawing out every single scene to its absolute limit. Also there's a twist at the end which was real stupid and didn't shock me at all--mostly cause I was so bored with the characters I could have cared less. Willis acts like a zombie the entire movie, but it's not really his fault--the script is pitted against him. Jackson actually makes his horrible dialogue sound realistic--a credit to this man's acting ability. Penn is excellent as Willis' wife. She's not in the film much, but when she is the film kickstarts to life. The actor who plays their son is only slightly less annoying than MacCauley Culkin was--take some acting lessons kid! A truly dreadful film. Avoid at all costs--unless you're suffering from insomnia--this will knock you out!",1,3,14,22 November 2000
Star Trek," I don't even like sci-fi and I loved this!
","A reboot of the old 'Star Trek'. This concentrates primarily on Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto). We briefly get their childhoods then it follows them as they get on the starship Enterprise and face off against a Romulan named Nero (Eric Bana) who--basically--wants to destroy the whole galaxy.I'm not a 'Star Trek' fan. I did see the original series but only once or twice when I was a kid. I also saw the Star Trek movies featuring the original cast but stopped when they started on the Next Generation. Also I've never really like sci-fi. Despite all this I LOVED the film! Never dull and full of action and adventure and some truly incredible special effects. The film moves quickly and even if you don't know the original series you'll still be able to understand it. If you DO remember the original you'll get a kick (as I did) out of some of the lines being used in the movie that come RIGHT out of the series. The acting is fairly good. Pine didn't impress me too much as Kirk. He comes across as shallow and kind of obnoxious. Quinto, on the other hand, was very good as Spock. Bana is given nothing to do as Nero but sneer at the screen and yell. Bruce Greenwood is excellent as Pike--the first commander of the Enterprise. Also Zoe Saldana makes a seriously sexy Uhara. Everybody else is pretty good also. The plot is kind of vague on some points but the movie moves so quickly you ignore them. This HAS to be seen on a big screen also. It will lose a lot on a small TV screen.So--from a non sci-fi film goer this is a great film! A perfect summer time flick. A 10 all the way.",10,3,20,3 June 2009
Akira," Violent, adult and fascinating
","Extremely bloody and violent animated film about neo-Tokyo 30 years or so after World War III. The story is way too complicated to get into--suffice to say it starts quickly and never lets up. Actually, that's a big problem.It does move quickly and is hard to follow (at times), and there barely a let-up. At two hours + that tends to wear you down. Also the English-dubbed language is very funny--all comic book clichés coming fast and furious. Still this is one of the best animes.The animation is mostly superb. Some of the characters moved rather awkwardly and they all look the same (a real problem with Japanese anime). Still all the other animation is just great. There are some stunning motorcycle ride/chases/fights and the views of neo-Tokyo 'moving' while the motorcycles are roaring really astounded me! Better than anything Disney ever did!I do have problems with this movie though. As I said, it's too convoluted, and the women are shown pretty badly. There are only two female characters--one is a victim (who, for no real reason at all, is almost raped) and the other is the love interest who will do anything for her man. Sheesh! Still, this is a truly fascinating film. If you have a strong stomach (the violence is VERY explicit) and can follow a plot going full-speed constantly, you'll like this.

Monster," Gripping but incredibly depressing
","Based on a true story this movie is about Ailen Wuornos, a prostitute, who killed quite a few men who she 'serviced'.  She was convicted in 1990 and executed in 2002.She's played by Charlize Theron who's just incredible.  It starts off just before she began murdering men and has met Selby (Christina Ricci), an adorable lesbian who loves her.  It basically chronicles their relationship and what led Wuornos to kill these men.  Also she reaccounts her childhood and how she became a prostitute.  It's more than a little depressing--it's a tragic story of a beaten woman who saw murder as the only way out.  Only three murders are shown and that's more than enough.  The violence is not glorified--it's bloody and sick and one is the most harrowing thing I've seen in years.  What's so fascinating (and scary) about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos!  While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it.  This is a rare film--it makes a serial killer look sympathetic.Theron is a wonder in this--she became Wuornos (who was very unattractive). She gained weight, shaved off her eyebrows, colored her hair, used contacts and dentures to change her appearance completely.  Never once did I think I was seeing Theron acting--she BECAME Wuornos.  A great performance--she'll easily get the Oscar for this one.  Ricci is also good here.  She's been ignored in the press but she nicely underplays the role of Selby and is a perfect contrast to Theron's acting.  Also nice to see Bruce Dern in a small role.Music is used very effectively here.  They play songs of the time it took place (1980s) so you know when this is happening and also nicely complements the actions on screen (especially with Journey's 'Don't Stop Believing').A very good movie but a very depressing one.  Proceed at your own risk.",9,228,257,14 February 2004
Memento," Exhausting but fascinating thriller
","A man (Guy Pearce) searches for the man who raped and killed his wife.  One problem--he has no long-term memory and forgets things a few minutes after he hears them.  Another thing--the whole story is shown backwards so you have to pay strict attention to what's going on.  It's difficult (most movies don't want you to think) and exhausting but absolutely fascinating. The acting is simply superb, direction assured and the story full of unexpected twists and turns.  Also there were revelations at the end (or beginning) that totally caught me by surprise.  It's not a perfect film--I still can't figure out what Moss' character was doing in this--but how many films can you name that challenge you and don't treat you like an idiot. This will probably be a bomb (it's way too difficult for an average audience), but if you like something different and intelligent this is definetely a film to see!",8,5,11,28 March 2001
Underworld," A GREAT horror film
","Vampires vs. werewolves. Sexy vampire woman (Kate Beckinsale) saves a muscular good-looking human (Scott Speedman) who is being chased by the werewolves. But why?There's a LOT more going on there but I'll let you find out for yourself. Basically this movie is VERY loud, full of ferocious gun fights (don't ask me why the wolves and vampires fight it out with guns--it just works and Beckinsale looks GREAT firing off a gun in each hand), washed out color, dark atmospheric sets, tons of fog, loud music on the soundtrack, plenty of blood, a very deep plot (for a horror film), some scary looking werewolves that can run along the walls and ceilings (!!!) and all done at a breathless pace. The damned movie only stops occasionally for the plot and then zips ahead full speed.The acting doesn't really matter--this movie is all about violence and visuals. That being said, Beckinsale (and the other vampires) look great in leather and I LOVE the long leather coats they wear when going to battle. Speedman is bad but, seriously, the poor guy has NOTHING to work with! The only other notable is Shane Brolly who basically sneers his way through his role...but it works.Next to 'House of 1000 Corpses' this is one of the best horror films released this year. It looks like a masterpiece compared to crap like 'Cabin Fever' and 'Cold Creek Manor'. Also there's a thankful lack of humor and camp in this film. It takes everything dead serious and plows ahead. I sat there totally engrossed during the entire film and grinning like an idiot because it was so GOOD! Basically a must-see for all horror fans.Also there's a set-up for a sequel...let's hope that DOESN'T happen. No horror film has ever had a good sequel.",10,3,13,3 October 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Surprisingly very good
","Reimaging of the 1979 horror classic.  The dead rise and begin to attack and eat the living who, in turn, also rise and join them.  A group of people are holed up in a huge shopping mall...but how will they get out with it surrounded by hundreds of flesh-eating dead people?It's not as good as the original but damn close (I'm giving it a 9).  Then again, it couldn't be as good.  The original was a ground-breaker--it was the first unrated horror film to play in first-run theatres.  Also, for 1979, the amount of gore was just staggering.  Nobody had ever seen anything like this!  Also it wasn't just a horror film--it was also a satire on American consumerism.This one totally drops the satire (not a bad idea) and just goes full speed ahead with action, adventure and gore.  It's not as gory as the original, but it definetely pushes the level for an R-rated film.  DO NOT see this if you're squeamish.The acting is just so-so--even the great Sarah Polley seems muted!  But really--who sees this for the acting?  It's scary, fast and violent and also the dead, this time around, move MUCH quicker (and are often filmed running in fast motion which is truly scary).  It does have its slow moments but those are few.  And I REALLY hated the ending.Still, well worth seeing for horror fans.",9,3,8,26 March 2004
Mississippi Burning," Powerful but not as moving as it should be
","Based on a true story. In 1964 Mississippi three civil right workers (2 whites, 1 black) disappear without a trace. FBI agents come to investigate--southern Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and straight-laced by the book Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson knows the south and the racism and believes in fighting dirty. Ward wants to go by the book and is a calm influence. They soon realize that the workers may be dead--and the town is covering it up.This received tons of negative publicity when it came out. It was based on a real life case and people said this movie distorted the facts or told outright lies. People don't seem to realize this is a FICTIONAL movie! It's not a documentary and doesn't pretend to be. It just uses the case as a starting point to show the ugly racism and hatred back then in Mississippi. It's VERY well made but somewhat disturbing to watch. There's plenty of swearing and a certain 'n' word is used constantly.It's an important movie...but it never connected with me emotionally. I WAS horrified to see what went on then and LOVED seeing the white guys getting it at the end...but I found it simplistic. All the white guys (save FBI agents) are ignorant vicious southerners who HATE blacks. All the black people just sit back and take all the violence directed at them without even attempting to fight back. How about all those freedom marches that happened back then? The clashes between black and white? They never happened? Turning the whites into monsters and all the blacks into victims was not the way to go. It distorts what the civil rights movement was like. I was always kept at a distance. The violence was strong and horrific (as it should be) but it never moved me. Still this is worth catching. Hackman is outstanding in his role (and was nominated for an Academy Award) and Frances McDormand is great in her too few scenes. Dafoe is a disappointment. He plays his character TOO straight-laced and unemotional. I got annoyed with him rather than cheering him on. Everybody else does great. This is far from a perfect film but it shows us a somewhat accurate portrayal of 1964. I'm glad this is being shown in high schools and colleges. I give it an 8.",8,2,4,30 August 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Very good but not great
","Romantic comedy/horror film (taking place in England) about Shaun and his friends trying to stay alive when the dead come alive and eat the flesh of the living.Yep--it had to happen eventually--a comedy about flesh-eating zombies. Surprisingly it really does work. This is one of the few movies that successfully mixes horror, comedy and drama. The only other ones I can think of are 'The Howling', 'American Werewolf in London' and 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'. Not all the jokes work but about 95% of them do. And the dramatic moments actually are well-worked into the plot. And this movie has PLENTY of blood and gore (for an R rated film). If this had been done seriously the ratings board probably would have demanded cuts. Now I DID like it (and was laughing out loud more than once) but it has some minor problems: most of the characters are extremely unlikable (especially Shaun's best friend); the film has its share of dead spots and some scenes are way too tragic for a film like this. Still, that aside, this is a very funny, gory movie. A must for horror fans. Try to see it with an audience--it really comes alive that way.",8,3,8,9 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great poster, lousy movie
","To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night!  Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering.  Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.This film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me.  There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late.  The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.I can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just 'the girl' in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief.  Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie.  His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat.  Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches.  Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one.",5,7,15,17 July 2003
Stripes," Unfunny, boring and sexist
","Inexplicably popular 'comedy'. John (Bill Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are two idiots who have no direction or reason in life. They decide to join the Army thinking it's a way to make easy money. They get stuck with a group of utterly annoying and unfunny guys (who the audience is supposed to find hysterical) and a tough as nails drill Sgt (Warren Oates). Naturally John is constantly cracking 'funny' one liners and screwing up deliberately left and right. None of it is funny at all. Then, at the end, it inexplicably turns into an army drama!This was a huge hut in 1981 and its popularity totally escapes me. I didn't like it back then and I still don't like it now. I should point that, personally, I never found Murray that funny. His blank face and obnoxious manner made me annoyed with him more than anything else. This movie does nothing to change my view. Basically the movie just isn't funny! I didn't smile (let alone laugh) once! Each joke fizzled out completely or they give us these somewhat interesting characters and NEVER build on them! When you get John Candy and Daniel Stern in a movie and even THEY'RE not funny something is seriously wrong. Worst of all is John Larroquette as Capt. Stillman. EVERY scene with his is terribly unfunny. And WHAT was the thinking of turning it into a generic action film at the end?? It's also incredibly sexist. You have the incredibly beautiful women P.J. Soles and Sean Young as MPs. Naturally they meet Murray and Ramis and let them get away with murder and almost immediately have sex with them. That's just pushing credibility WAY too far. The absolute low point is a pointless and downright revolting mud wrestling match when Candy is wrestling with five bikini clad beautiful women. Naturally he (inexplicably) gets ALL their tops off and waves them around! The two good points are Oates (giving a GREAT performance) and a bombastic score. Why this movie was such a big hit is beyond me. A 1 all the way.",1,17,33,9 January 2011
Beauty and the Beast," Disney discovers feminism (sort of)
","Belle is a beautiful, innocent, intelligent and kind young girl bored with her life in her small village. Her lovable father falls in the clutches of the Beast who is really a handsome prince under a spell. She trades herself for her father's freedom. The Beast agrees. Also the spell on him can be broken if someone loves him--but time is running out. Since this is a Disney film you probably know how it ends.This was a blockbuster success for Disney. It was also the first animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It's beautifully done with some jaw-dropping animation--the ballroom sequence is already a classic. Also it's a musical and it's one of those rare occurrences where EVERY song works! This was a well-deserved Oscar winner for Best Song and Score. I saw the extended version with one new song--'Human Again'--which fits in seamlessly with the original movie. All the voices match the characters perfectly--it's quite amusing to realize that Robby Benson does the Beast's voice! Also this was (for Disney) a step forward in portraying female characters. Their previous film ('The Little Mermaid') got some heat for how the mermaid NEEDED a man to live. In this film Belle doesn't need anyone--she's strong, self-willed and can fight back. She does fall in love with the Beast but not because she needs him--in fact he needs her! For Disney that was feminism.Basically one of the best Disney cartoons ever. Also it's perfect for the kids--only really small ones might be frightened. Perfect for everyone--a 10 all the way.",10,5,6,18 November 2007
Hostel," Eli Roth bombs again!
","Two American guys (played by Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are traveling through Europe. Their reason is to have sex with as many women as is possible. They are directed to this remote European village full of beautiful women...but their dream swiftly becomes a nightmare...Director/writer Eli Roth gave us a lousy horror movie a few years ago called 'Cabin Fever'. I never wanted to see anything he did again but this has an interesting premise and I DO like Jay Hernandez. I should have known better! Like his first film we are given characters that we don't know anything at all about (Hernandez and Richardson have NOTHING to work with) and we really don't like. Seriously--we're supposed to give a damn about two horny American boys who only want to have nonstop sex? Richardson and Hernandez are as good as they could be--meaning not very. The script is terrible. Like I said the premise isn't bad but the dialogue is lousy AND offensive (I didn't like Hernandez saying 'That's so gay' after anything went wrong) and the script doesn't make a lot of sense. The direction is off too--some shots were framed so badly I couldn't believe it! The gore is effective and extreme--but I didn't know or care who it was being done to. I also love how two characters have body parts chopped off, but are walking around OK right after--they should be dead of blood loss or in shock.Also there is TONS of pointless female nudity. It got to a point where I was just getting angry. I went to see a HORROR film not a soft core porno flick! I also noticed Richardson and Hernandez were never shown nude.Even worse than 'Cabin Fever'. Boring and pointless. As I was leaving one woman behind me said, 'That was the worst movie I ever saw.' I agree. I give it a 1.",1,18,40,21 January 2006
The Notebook," Heart-breaking but great
","The movie begins in 1940 where young and poor Noah (Ryan Gosling) falls in love with rich Allie (Rachel McAdams). Naturally she hates him at first but soon falls in love with him too. However her parents are horrified and keep them apart. Seven years later they meet and she's already set to marry someone else (James Marsters). Can she forget Noah? Also the story has a wrap around featuring an elderly couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands).At first I hated this film. I disliked the characters and was insulted by the non-stop clichés popping up. But, eventually it won me over. The acting was great, the cinematography stunning and the story moved briskly. By the end I was crying my eyes out nonstop. This is a very romantic but heart-breaking movie to watch. Recommended but plenty of tissues handy.",10,1,1,23 September 2018
Ted," Funny and (surprisingly) not that crude
","John Bennett gets a giant teddy bear for Christmas when he's about 10. He wishes it will be his best friend for life. The next day the bear magically comes to life and can walk and talk and promises to always be John's best friend. Cut to 25 years later. John (Mark Wahlberg) lives with his hot girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and Ted (voice of Seth MacFarlane) is living with them. Lori makes an ultimatum--Ted or her. John picks her--but can him and Ted live without each other? Funny and not as crude as you might think. This is being pushed as a comedy with a foul-mouthed teddy bear. Granted--Ted makes crude, racist, homophobic and sexist jokes but not that many. He's comes off as a funny and sweet bear (I can't believe I just typed that!). In many ways this is (story-wise) very familiar. It has a guy in love with a girl but his best buddy is always around. She makes him choose. He picks her. The best friend leaves. Tragedy strikes etc etc. It's very obvious how this will all end. Still I did laugh long and loud more than once.There are constant reference to one of my favorite movies--the 1980 version of 'Flash Gordon'--John and Ted love it too! They take scenes and music from the movie and Sam J. Jones (Flash) pops up also.! As I said before most of the jokes are offensive but VERY funny. This was shot in Boston and I've never seen Boston look so GREAT on the big screen! They perfectly use the locations. Also Kunis is great (and very beautiful) in her role. Wahlberg is no more than adequate but it works. Also look for cameos from Ryan Reynolds (he doesn't have a word of dialogue) and Tom Skerritt! And Ted is just adorable and VERY likable (even when he's swearing a blue streak). Predictable but funny. I give it a 7.",7,2,9,7 July 2012
Knives Out," Good comedic murder mystery
","A rich elderly writer (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his combative family (including Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Chris Evans) line up to see who gets what. But was it really suicide...or murder? Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts investigating.Good mystery. It's full of twists and turns and has some funny moments. Also there's some stunning production design--LOVE the house Plummer lives in. There's also a large great cast giving good performances. No one is bad but Craig, Curtis and Evans are excellent. Still I didn't love it. It's a little too long and gets needlessly convoluted at the end. Also a lot of the humor fell flat and some of these characters are really vicious. Still it's worth seeing at least once for the cast alone.",7,3,5,24 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Well-done but clichÃ©d and uninteresting
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is Spiderman...but it's affecting his personal life. Peter can't hold down a job because he's always out helping people AND he's failing his classes at school AND he can't pay his rent AND he's losing his powers AND his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is going to loose her house AND his friend Harry Osborn (James Franco is becoming an alcoholic AND he loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but can't let her know cause it would put her in danger etc etc. Then Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) shows up with deadly mechanical arms that do his bidding. I realize that the movie has to show the hero overcoming adversity but this just pours on the misery to a ridiculous degree. I started getting the uncomfortable feeling that the screenwriters of this enjoyed making the character suffer. To make matters worse Maguire can't act. He's stone-faced throughout the entire picture so, instead of feeling sorry for him, you don't feel anything. Add to that is the comic book dialogue and plotting which just dumbs down the entire movie. Yes, I'm well aware that this IS based on a comic book but what works as a comic does not translate to movies as well. Also J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is not funny or cute--just annoying.So why am I giving this five stars? To be honest I was never bored. Annoyed yes but not bored. Franco, Dunst, Molina and Harris all give good performances (despite the material). The special effects are superb and the fight between Doc Ock and Spider Man on top of a train is exciting and fun. Without Maguire in the title role this might have been better--but I can never accept him as Peter Parker or Spider Man. A 5 at best.",5,3,7,2 September 2011
Billy Elliot," A good little movie
","A motherless boy being brought up by a cruel brother and uncaring father, finds an escape through dancing.  It's all very predictable and the ending is lousy, but the acting is good, some of the dancing is astonishing and the movie is never dull.  But somehow, it never really connected with me.  I liked it, but it just wasn't as good as I had heard it was.  Basically, a very good little movie.  But not worth $9.00.  Also, the R rating is wrong. Yes, there's a lot of swearing, but it shows a little boy who, against all odds, prevails.  That's a great message for kids.  It should have gotten a PG-13.",7,1,3,15 November 2000
Black Book," Just like a Hollywood war movie--with more nudity and violence
","This was inspired by true events. In Holland in 1944 a Jewish girl (Carice von Houten) tries to help the Dutch Resistance after seeing her whole family shot to death by the Nazis. She pretends to be attracted to the head of the Gestapo (Sebastian Koch) and eventually gets him into bed AND falls in love! Does she betray the man she loves or her country? Paul Verhoeven made this VERY expensive movie in Holland. It seems he learned a lot from making all those films in Hollywood--this plays JUST like a Hollywood war movie from the 1950s. It's glossy and it looks great--but loaded with violence, nudity and profanity. It moves quickly and even though it's 145 minutes it's never dull. The acting is pretty good--von Houten has a very tough role but pulls it off. The same for Koch. You despise him but see his humanity underneath. Verhoeven regulars Thom Hoffman and Jeron Krabbe (who were both also in 'The 4th Man') pop up giving strong performances in supporting roles. This movie is a little bit too long and it gets very confusing at the end with the double and triple crosses piling up--but I still loved it. Worth catching but avoid it if you're offended by extreme content.",8,3,8,14 February 2009
Spice World," Wish I could have voted lower than '1'
","I saw this 'thing' (I can't bring myself to say 'movie') back in 1997 when it came out.  I went partially out of curiosity and partially because it got some good reviews.  I was appalled!  The girls can't act, can't dance, certainly can't sing and have no personality between them.  There was no plot, all the 'jokes' were unfunny, all the reputable actors that agreed to show up look embarassed (as they should be).  I usually sit through any movie no matter how bad, but I walked out on this one.  Just simply everything about it was BAD!!!!  And, no it wasn't good enough for laughs. I couldn't even think out things to yell at it...it's one of those movies you just watch in disbelief that something this terrible could be filmed and released.

Batman Returns," Visually impressive...but that's it
","The Pengiun (Danny DeVito) and evil millionaire Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) team up to rule Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton) tries to stop them. He also has to deal with Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has ideas of her own.Dark and pretty sick sequel to the 1989 'Batman'. For starters the villains are pretty silly. DeVito is in an obvious fat suit as the Penguin and his character is needlessly grotesque. Walken sleep walks through his role (as always). Pfeiffer REALLY tries (and looks great in that costume) but her character goes all over the place and acts real strange (even for a Tim Burton film). Keaton is miscast--but he IS good. The movie is filled with stupid one liners which come out of nowhere and seem totally out of place in this context. The tone of the movie keeps switching gears--from comedy, to action, to horror, to romance--erratically. Also Batman kills two people (!!!), little babies are kidnapped and/or put in danger, the sexual aggressiveness of Catwoman is REALLY strong (for a PG-13 movie), the Penguin bites somebody on the nose and people are casually killed left and right. The story also ceases to make sense at certain points and goes barreling out of control by the end. I mean--penguins with BOMBS on their backs invading Gotham City? Come on! Director Tim Burton seems only concerned about production design and special effects. They are impressive (especially Wayne Manor) but swallow the story and the actors. Also the constant dark tone and cruelness really wears one down after a while. I kept watching but the darkness of this one was really too strong--this deserved an R rating.This was a big hit but parents who saw it with their children were (understandably) outraged and bombarded Warner Bros. with letters and calls. Because of that Burton had no hand in 'Batman Forever' (the next movie). I do think Batman movies should be dark but not at the expense of characters and plot lines. And did Burton really think it was wise to have so much violence in a film children were going to see? And Batman should not kill. I give this a 6 for production design alone. Don't let little kids see this.",6,8,13,11 February 2007
Finding Nemo," Pixar has done it again!
","Pixar Studios (with Walt Disney) has done another incredible computer-animated family film.  (Their previous works were Toy Story 1 & 2 and Monsters Inc).This one involves a clownfish (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his young son who was 'captured' by an Australian dentist for his fish tank in his office.  He's 'helped' by another fish (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who has no short-term memory.This film is just dazzling to watch.  The underwater sequences are beautiful, full of color and life.  In every single case the voices match the animals perfectly.  The jokes are great--they can appeal to both children and adults (my favorites were the shark being called Bruce--a reference to 'Jaws' and DeGeneres trying to 'speak' whale).  There are some scenes that might frighten very small children involving some vicious-looking animals with big, sharp teeth--but the movie is not violent or bloody at all (it IS G rated).Basically a really fun great film.

Superbad," Nothing new here
","Comedy about three nerdy teenage boys about to graduate from high school. Naturally they're all virgins and naturally they want to have sex before graduating. There's the thin shy guy (Michael Cera), the fat foul-mouthed guy (Jonah Hill) and the nerd with glasses (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). They have tiredly obvious misadventures on the night of a big party.How did this get to be such a huge hit? The story and jokes are old and obvious. ALL of this has been done to death and this adds absolutely nothing new. I saw the ending coming a mile away. To make matters worse you don't like any of these kids. Cera is blank the entire movie. He basically says his lines with no expression--ever. Hill easily plays one of the most obnoxious characters ever. He's always insulting, always swearing (he uses the word 'f***' nonstop) and is just grating. I kept wondering why Cera put up with him at all. Mintz-Plasse overdoes his nerdy character far too well. The movie isn't a total washout however. Bill Hader (looking like a very young Dan Aykroyd) and Seth Rogan are very funny as police officers Slater and Michaels. They manage to make even the tired lines they're given seem funny. Also I did smile a few times and the supporting cast was very attractive and appealing. So it's OK but you've seen this all before.

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Has its moments
","Andy (Kate Hudson) is a columnist for a woman's magazine--to cheer up a depressed, jilted girlfriend she proposes an article on getting a guy to love her--and then do everything wrong to get him to dump her in 10 days. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) is an ad executive who wants to do a campaign for diamonds. His boss says no--what does a man know about love and diamonds? Ben says he will get a woman to fall in love with him--in 10 days. Guess what happens.There are two problems with this movie--the script and McConaughey. The script isn't believable for one second and it has such unpleasant characters--are we supposed to feel sympathetic to Andy and Ben who would stoop to manipulating an innocent person for their jobs? Also it does have some very funny lines but has even more unfunny, labored ones. McConaughey is all wrong for a romantic comedy--he is very handsome and has a great body but he seems very ill at ease with the material. He both overacts and underacts and has no sense of comic timing. And him and Hudson have about as much chemistry as Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis had in 'Top Gun'--meaning no chemistry at all. Their kisses looked painful.The real reason to see this is Hudson. She's beautiful, bright, energetic and one hell of an actress and comedian. She's absolutely hysterical when she tries to drive McConaughey crazy. Also when begins to fall in love (I don't think I'm giving anything away) she's totally believable.Worth seeing for Hudson and some great lines. Otherwise--routine.",6,0,2,24 February 2003

What's going on?The movie is VERY dark, very creepy and very quiet...and that's the problem. It's too much. There's a constant air of dread and danger and it really wore me down. Also the film moves at a (purposefully) slow pace--too slow for me. It's all well-done and there are a few scenes guaranteed to make you jump (or scream) but it was too depressing.

","In the late 1960s, John Keating (Robin Williams) comes to teach at a prestigous prep school.  His unconventional teaching ways (and his telling them to 'carpe diem'--seize the day) have some strong effects on his students--in particular; Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) who hates the school; Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is helplessly in love with a girl; Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) who is painfully shy and Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor despite his father's (Kurtwood Smith) refusal. This all leads to a predictable conclusion.Let's get my complaints out of the way--the story is predictable (how it won an Oscar for Best Screenplay is beyond me) and the tragic turn late in the story is really not needed.  I also didn't believe the final sequence for one second. Also I kept getting the feeling that this was made just to win Oscars.  That aside, this is a great film.It IS predictable but still is well-written, well-acted and well-directed. Williams (justly nominated for Best Actor) is great.  He tones down his usual over the top personality and underplays his part very nicely.  The teaching sequences with his students are great--a really good one was when he teaches Hawke how to 'write' a poem.  Also his 'carpe diem' became a catch phrase for years afterwords.  Hansen is also very good as Dalton as is Charles as Overstreet.  Hawke (who i usually hate) was surprisingly good as Anderson and Leonard is just exceptional as Perry--every time he was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off him.  He's one hell of an actor.  Also Smith is totally evil as a domineering father.  Basically, nobody is bad and they say all their lines with conviction.  Even though I saw everything coming I didn't care--the acting was so good I couldn't stop watching.The direction by Weir is great.  Two sequences stand out--when Williams is teaching Hawke about the poem and when three of the boys are chasing each other around a room.  Also there are some really beautiful sequences such as the winter ones and when the boys go out in the dead of night for 'society' meetings.  Incidentally Dead Poets Society is the boys getting together in a cave late at night and reading poetry or telling tall tales to each other. Sounds strange, but it works in the context of the movie.I'm giving this a 10--I just wish I could get rid of those lingering doubts about WHY this picture was made...I wish it was for the story and the acting, but I don't think it was.",10,4,7,15 February 2004
Brokeback Mountain," I was bored
","In 1963 Wyoming two cowboys (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) are watching over sheep on a remote mountain--Brokeback Mountain. They grow to know and understand each other--and have sex one cold night. The affair continues until they have to leave. Ledger marries (Michelle Williams) and so does Gyllenhaal (Anne Hathaway). After 4 years apart they get together again...and find they still love each other.OK for starters--I'm a gay man who is proud to be gay. I didn't dislike this movie because of homophobia (internalized or otherwise). The gay story is what kept me watching in fact. The acting is all good with Ledger a standout. You see his character's pain and confusion and he ages VERY convincingly. Gyllenhaal is good too but not as good as Ledger. The cinematography is beautiful...but I was bored silly. The movie moved VERY slowly and was way too quiet. I lost track of how many times I looked at my watch. Also the love story between the men (which I thought was the main point of the movie) was very subdued and only a small portion of the film. When it gets into the dreary domestic portions I was bored--it was only when Ledger and Gyllenhaal are dealing with their relationship that this movie worked. Also the dialogue was wooden--the actors do their best but there's little they can do with this.Why this is getting so critically praised is beyond me. And why are Ledger and Gyllenhaal being called so 'brave' to play gay men? I don't think anybody would say they were 'brave' to play murderers, rapists or killers. As it is they both seem terrified to show any love or emotion. The one sex scene was violent--not erotic and the big kissing scene was almost completely hidden by Jake's hat. However I think the main problem with this film was the director. Ang Lee is a good director--but all wrong for this. He seems too timid to fully address the issue and throws in all these pointless subplots. There's also no need for this film to run over two hours.I give it a 1. I really can not recommend this film.",1,27,90,24 December 2005
Orphan," Too slow for its own good
","Vera and John Coleman (Vera Farminga and Peter Sarsgaard) adopt a 9 year old girl named Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). They already have two other kids--a younger girl named Max (Aryana Engineer) and an older boy named Daniel (Jimmy Bennett). We slowly (TOO slowly) discover that there's something wrong with Esther and it leads to horror and murder.**DEFINITE PLOT SPOILERS** Well-done but just too long (123 minutes). This idea has been done before ('The Bad Seed', 'The Good Son') so this movie seems to drag everything out. It's also uncomfortable to watch with children always being threatened or (possibly) killed. In one particularly idiotic oversight one kid's fate is left hanging in the air at the end of the movie! I should mention that it's not a blood and guts horror film (except for one VERY bloody stabbing) but, at the end, it turns into a boring, by the numbers stalking where the killer keeps coming back again and again and again. Also the explanation about Esther at the end doesn't really make much sense but it IS original. On the plus side the acting is good especially by Farmiga and Fuhrman. Only Sarsgaard disappoints but that's because the script makes his character seem like a total idiot! There's also a GREAT moment where Farmiga slaps Fuhrman down (my audience broke out in applause). So--it has its moments but is very disturbing to watch at times and just drags on. I give it a 6.",6,10,16,2 August 2009
Home Alone," WAY too violent. THIS got by with a PG??????
","A heavily dysfunctional family are going away for the Christmas holidays. They accidentally leave 8 year old Kevin (the annoying Macauley Culkin) alone at home. Other than doing what a normal kid would do (go to a neighbor or call the police) he decides to stay at home all alone. Two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern--both who deserve better) try to break in. Culkin manages to single-handedly set up elaborate bobby traps to stop them.What a violent sick piece of garbage! I caught this is a theatre back in 1990. I saw it after a long week at work and expected a mindless fun PG movie. I was horrified by what I got. For starters the story was impossible. Leaving behind an 8 year old kid by mistake??? Come on! Also the whole family is heavily dysfunctional and not at all funny. Culkin manages to set up elaborate traps and stuff that no 8 year old could ever do. When Pesci and Stern show up the movie goes from stupid and unbelievable to extremely violent. These poor guys repeatedly get burnt and hit repeatedly on the head and face again and again--and it's all played for laughs! I was sickened by the level of violence in this film. How did this get a PG rating???? Also violence against people is NOT funny. It got to the point that I was rooting for the burglars. Aside from all this it just simply isn't funny. Sick, stupid and unbelievable yes--but NOT funny.The acting is as bad as you'd expect. Culkin is annoying from the start. Not cute at all--you want the little brat to get it badly. Stern and Pesci do what they can with nothing roles. Still, I realize I'm not the audience for this. In the theatre I saw it with was full of families with their kids. During the violence all the adults sat there horrified while all the little kids were screaming (literally) with laughter. A few parents dragged their kids out of there--I wish I had joined them. This was (inexplicably) a huge hit and led to the thankfully brief career of Culkin. Avoid this like the plague and definitely do NOT let small kids see it. A 1.",1,12,52,2 August 2010
Spotlight," Powerful and maddening
","Based on fact drama. It's about a newspaper (the Boston Globe) who's Spotlight team (played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James) broke the sex scandal about priests molesting alter boys in the Catholic church in 2002. It shows step by step how they found out about it and how the Catholic church does everything in its power to block them.Powerful and frightening drama. It's not a loud movie. It's all talk and moves slowly but I was never bored. I'm a native Bostonian and I remember when this story broke. However this movie reveals a LOT more that was never made public. I was VERY angry by the end. It makes it clear that the church knew very well was going on and did nothing to stop it. Even worse they kept transferring the priests from parish to parish spreading the abuse. The movie treats this in a matter of fact way making it all the more powerful. It was beautifully filmed in and around Boston. It's easy to see why this got a Golden Globe nod for Best Direction and an Oscar for Best Picture. All the cast is good--especially McAdams and Ruffalo. When Ruffalo loses control at the end it's shocking. A long and depressing film that will make you angry but it's a must-see movie.",10,4,8,14 December 2015
Insomnia," What's the big deal?
","An LAPD cop (Al Pacino) and his partner (Martin Donovan), are sent to Alaska to help solve the murder of a 17 year old girl.  They're helped by a young, eager policewoman (Hilary Swank).  Problem is that Pacino can't sleep, things start going horribly wrong and the killer is playing games with Pacino's mind.Sounds a lot better than it actually is.  The movies is very quiet and punishingly slow at times. There are twists in the story but they're presented so casually that they have no effect at all.  The direction is annoying (especially during a junkyard sequence) but there is some stunning cinematography (Alaska is gorgeous).  Also, the story has been done before (and better).The performances help somewhat.  Pacino is great (as always).  He really anchors the film.  Swank is just wonderful but criminally underused.**SPOILER--KILLER'S IDENTITY REVEALED**It's not really a spoiler--everybody knows Robin Williams plays it--and he's just dreadful.  For starters, he doesn't show up until the movie is half over and he's so wooden and stiff.  He (unwisely) underplays the role.  It doesn't work.Why is this movie being so heavily praised?  Yes, Pacino is great and the director's last movie was 'Memento', but that shouldn't automatically make this a great movie.  Very OK--highly overrated.",6,0,1,3 June 2002
Deadpool 2," Good but familiar
","Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) has to deal with a teen mutant called Firefist (Julian Dennison) who has anger issues. Then Cable (Josh Brolin) comes from the future. It seems Firefist as an adult killed his wife and kid and wants to kill him before he grows up.
Sequel to the wildly successful original. However it's not as good. A LOT of the jokes are carried over from the original and they aren't funnier the second time around. Also at almost two hours it's too long. On the plus side the acting is good and Brolin clearly enjoys playing Cable. Lots of action and violence too. So--it's up to you if you want to see it.",6,3,6,25 May 2018
X-Men," Pretty good
","Probably the best big-screen movie from a Marvel comic (although that's not saying much).  It's basically Wolverine's movie all the way and newcomer Hugh Jackman was excellent in the role.  Also Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (as Dr X and Magneto) were great too.  As for everybody else...Halle Berry is all wrong as Storm (not exotic enough); James Marsden is a good actor but he's totally miscast as Cyclops; Famke Janssen (sp?) is given nothing to do as Jean Gray and Anna Paquin is too whiny as Rogue.  The villains don't fare much better.  Sabretooth is laughable, Toad is too powerful...the others I can't even remember...Mystique did make an impression though.  So, all in all, it's passable summer entertainment. Hopefully the sequel will be better.",7,2,4,18 July 2000
Spider-Man 3," Talk about overkill!
","The (thankfully) last Tobey Maguire/Spiderman movie. This has him ready to marry fiancée Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but things (LOTS of things) start to happen. The new Green Goblin (James Franco) is trying to kill him thinking Spidey killed his dad. The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) shows up to...something (the movie's really not clear on that) and an alien symbiote turns Spidermans' costume black and turns Parker AND Spiderman evil. Then Venom (Topher Grace) shows up later on.Talk about overdone! TOO many villains, too many plot lines (and plot holes), WAY too violent, too long (the longest one of the series) and surprisingly dull. As always the special effects are incredible but the dialogue and stories are still at a dumb comic book level. Maguire surprisingly acts (a little) here. He was blank in the first two movies but here he actually smiles. However when he's called to play a badass guy it's hysterically bad. I was laughing out loud! Dunst was good in the first two--here she's just blank. Also she sings two songs--that was NOT a good idea! Dunst just can't really sing. Church was lousy as Sandman. He speaks in a monotone and never changes expression. Grace was GREAT as Venom but he can't save the film. Franco seems sort of confused in his role and his 180 degree turnaround towards the end didn't make sense. As I said it's WAY too violent for a PG-13. A few of the fights Spidey has would have easily killed him. But it's the multiple (bad) story lines, bad acting and length really sink it. A 1 all the way.",1,3,5,4 September 2011
Match Point," A good film--but no masterpiece
",A Woody Allen film shot in London! An retired Irish tennis star Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) quits the circuit and takes a job teaching rich people how to play. He becomes friends with VERY rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and starts romancing his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Then he meets Tom's girlfriend Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and falls in lust for her...This isn't a comedy. It's a very grim tale of adultery. This has been praised as a comeback for Woody Allen--his last few films have been laugh less comedies. It's also been described as a masterpiece. It is good but not THAT good.To be totally honest I don't understand why this is being praised so much. The story is downbeat and moves VERY slowly (this film could easily lose 20 minutes). The affair between Chris and Nola comes out of nowhere--I never believed it for one second. Nola comes off as shrill and having no idea what she wants out of life. Her character is very unlikable--you wonder what Chris sees in her. The film really falls apart during the ending. Nola acts seriously deranged and Chris goes WAY too far. I also saw the resolution coming from a mile away. Also Allen has no feeling at all on how to shoot London. In his New York films you got a real sense of the city--not here in London. Also ALL the characters (with the exception of Nola) are nice--all the time. They're TOO nice. I didn't believe them for one second.The acting really carries this film. Meyers is drop dead handsome and very good in his role. Goode and Mortimer are also good. I didn't like Johansson but that's mostly because of her character.So I don't really like this film but I don't hate it. I was fairly entertained and it was OK. I give it a 7 and that's mostly because of the acting.,7,0,5,2 February 2006
Zodiac," It was OK but has serious problems
","Movie based on the unsolved Zodiac killings in California in the 1960s-1970s. A man was killing people with no rhyme or reason and sent notes to California newspapers daring them to figure out who he was. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) try to figure out who he is while police inspector Davod Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner (Anthony Edwards) try to catch him.This film has a lot of good things going for it--it's well directed (excellent use of wide screen), has some good acting (especially by Downey) and manages to wring some suspense out of the story despite the fact that you know how it ends. There's also good supporting performances by Chloe Sevigny and Dermot Mulroney. Still this film has three serious problems. One is Gyllenhaal. He is a good actor but appears totally out of his depth here. He wears one expression the entire movie and his acting quickly becomes annoying. The second is the length of this movie--it's way too long. It rambles on for 160 minutes and gets tedious more than once. I kept looking at my watch and more than once considered leaving. I stayed because I figured I had paid my $10.00 so--why not? Also the story keeps jumping around and, if something has nothing to do with the killer, it's tossed off casually.For example...Sevigny is introduced as a date of Gyllenhaal. We don't see her until about 30 minutes later and by this time she's his wife AND they have kids! No mention was made of them getting married or having kids. This is a little thing but it caught my attention and was distracting.So--it has good acting and direction but goes on far too long and was too disjointed. I give it a 6.",6,8,20,11 March 2007
Milk," Powerful and moving
","True story of Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) and how he was elected as the first openly gay city councilor in San Francisco in 1978. It follows how he got there, how he got people to help him, his various campaigns before, his lovers Scott Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lara (Diego Luna) and his tragic murder (along with the mayor of San Francisco) by Dan White (Josh Brolin).As an out gay man it's about time this was made by an openly gay director! At first I found Gus van Sant's flashy direction off-putting but it quickly pulled me in. The story was fast-moving and I was totally engrossed. The two hours flew by! Director van Sant expertly mixed actual footage of events with the ones he shoot--I almost never noticed the difference! They caught the 1970s (when this took place) head on--the ugly clothes and hairstyles were accurate. The acting is superb across the board--Emile Hirsch, Diego Luna, James Franco and Alison Pill especially were incredible. Best of all was Sean Penn. He doesn't appear to be acting--he IS Harvey Milk! If this man doesn't (at the very least) get an Academy Award nomination there's no justice in the world. The only acting disappointment is Josh Brolin. He's a wonderful actor but we get no insight to his character--but then the movie isn't about him. The movie itself is shattering. I broke down crying three times--especially at the end (you also see actress Pill starting to loose it). Also, if you're worried about nudity, there's next to none here. Franco briefly bares his butt and Luna flashes his too--but that's it.A wonderful if depressing motion picture. Everybody should see this one! I give it a 9. I wanted to give it a 10 but it's so ultimately depressing.",9,4,11,12 December 2008
The Prestige," Intelligent and incredibly suspenseful
",Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006. A definite must-see!,10,4,7,15 April 2008
The Terminator," One of the best sci-fi action films ever made
","In 2026 machines have taken over and are killing mankind--but one man is beating them. A cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent from the future to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)-the mother of that man. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) also goes back to prevent him from killing her.Now legendary science fiction action film is every bit as good as its reputation. It moves quickly and is full of action and violence almost virtually nonstop. There are plenty of exciting high speed car chases and a knockout sequence when Arnie basically decimates an entire police station--and everyone in it. The special effects are impressive especially considering this was a low-budget film. The plot is intelligent and intricate--it treats its audience with respect. There are some amusing things that date this--the VERY 80s music soundtrack, the Tech Noir club (which has a $4.50 cover charge) and hysterically bad clothes.The acting isn't that good. Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as a robot and Biehn walks through his role. Only Hamilton gives a good performance--but who watches this for the acting? Also there are some familiar faces in small roles--Bill Paxton (as a punk); Dick Miller (the gun store owner); Rick Rossovich (as a doomed boyfriend) and Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as police officers. Also this is the film that gave Arnie his infamous 'I'll be back' line.This movie has its lulls--it does come to a screeching halt when Reese and Connor get to know each other (even though that sequence IS necessary) and it does have to take time out to explain things. Still this is an exciting, violent movie well worth catching. This rightfully put director James Cameron on the map.Best line: 'You're terminated f**ker!'",8,1,3,24 February 2006
Sleepy Hollow," Striking visuals...little else
","OK, the film LOOKS fantastic. The scenes are almost always in darkness, there's plenty of fog and some breathtaking shots of the Headless Horseman going after his victims. Other than that, the movie is hopeless. The plot is, to put it mildly, confusing; the cast is surprisingly bad (even Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci!); and the film gets very unpleasant after a while (we are almost constantly seeing somebody's head lopped off). SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The plot is the main problem--none of the characters are clearly defined, Depp is real annoying, every single female character is a witch and it's very hard to follow (looks like there were huge chunks of dialogue edited out). They do pull it all together at the end, but there are still many unexplained characters and motivations (the witch in the cave for example). EVERYONE is bad--I never thought I'd say that about Depp and Ricci, but it's true. Also the scenes of people's heads getting lopped off gets very boring after the 8th time. Visually it's incredible though, and some of the scenes are really creepy. So if you're into visuals, you'll probably like the movie. If you want plot, character or depth--stay away.",6,1,2,24 November 1999
Silent Hill," Very gory, confusing and very good
","Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) has trouble with her adopted child Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). She keeps sleepwalking and yelling 'Silent Hill!' Silent Hill was a town that was destroyed when a huge fire swept over it. Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill but loses consciousness in an accident. When she comes to Sharon is gone and Rose goes to Silent Hill to find her...I never played the video game so I can only review this as a movie. Visually it's very impressive with eerie locations and purposely washed out color. There's almost never a dull moment with monsters attacking (for some reason) left and right. Most of these things are never explained but certainly grab your attention. I assume they make sense in the video game. I do have to state it's a pretty sad state of affairs when you have to play a video game to fully understand a movie. Still I was never bored--I was trying to figure out the movie most of the time! There's also PLENTY of gore with people being ripped apart or torn open--this is not for the squeamish.The acting is as good as it can be. Mitchell is good but a lot of her actions make no sense (again, they probably do in the game). Laurie Holden is very good as a police officer helping her. Sean Bean has a few good moments as Roses' husband. Alice Krige is exceptional as Christabelle--downright chilling. Ferland is wonderful as Sharon--this young girl has a bright career in front of her.Basically I did like it but the plot was more than confusing and it got VERY upsetting towards the end. Also the ending was sort of ambiguous--I THINK it's meant to be that way. There's also a cute joke in the movie--the school in Silent Hill is called 'Midwich'. This is probably a direct pun on the book 'Midwich Cuckoos' which became 'Village of the Damned' about the evil kids--and that relates to this movie.I give it a 9 because of the confusing bits and pieces and the ending. I do recommend it with some reservations. This is a must-see for gore fans.",9,5,9,6 May 2006
Dear John," Absolutely dreadful 'romance'
","The movie starts in spring 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) while on break. Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to reenlist--she wants him to stay home. What will they do? Hysterically bad romantic drama. The leads ARE attractive--Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he's introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing)...but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries...but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard NOT to laugh out loud at some of the 'romantic' dialogue at the beginning. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so I was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous 'romance'. Then, after that first hour, tragedy kicks in and, I must admit, had me in tears. However the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you're crying with death, funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears. How can you NOT cry? This would have worked if the acting were better. Tatum's face never changes expression--not ONCE! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a LITTLE better but not much. To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen at all! They barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other. There was some beautiful photography of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic 'drama'. A 1 all the way...and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this!",1,95,190,6 February 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Mediocre at best
","Comedic western based on actual people--Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). They were outlaws in 1880s and robbed banks. The plot of the movie (what little there is of it) has them robbing banks, joking with each other nonstop, riding from the police, robbing banks, joking with each other etc etc etc. It's basically the same thing over and over. Newman and Redford work well with each other. They toss off one-liners (some that are quite funny) with ease in a care-free, easy-going manner. The problem is that's all their characters are--walking talking joke machines. No complexity or depth is ever shown. Poor Katharine Ross (who can be very good) is also shamefully wasted as Redford's girlfriend. Even worse Redford is terrible as the Kid--blank-faced throughout. Slow-moving and too long also and it turns needlessly violent at the end. There's also a near-rape in the film that's treated as a joke! The movie has some good points--it starts out in sepia (a nice touch) and doesn't turn into color until about 10 minutes in; the bicycle sequence with Newman and Ross with the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' (an Oscar winner) playing; Newman is very good in his role and the lines are funny. But everything else is pretty bad. How this was a such a big hit is beyond me. A 4 all the way.",4,8,17,17 August 2010
Crash," STRONG racial drama
","Story about two days in the life of various characters in LA. There's a rich couple (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser) who have their car stolen by two black men. There's Don Cheadle playing a police detective with partner Jennifer Esposito--he has a junkie mother and a criminal brother. Matt Dillon plays a VERY racist cop with horrified partner Ryan Phillippe. Loretta Devine plays a black health insurance worker who has to deal with Dillon. A middle Eastern couple has their store looted by a gang who think they're Arabs. Terence Howard plays a man whose wife is sexually (sort of) assaulted by Dillon--who did it because he's black. There's also a Latino repairman mixed in this. These stories all start up apart and slowly converge together by the end.The movie is strong--the dialogue pulls no punches and ethic slurs are commonly used BUT it is necessary for the the integrity of the story. The movie is (of course) anti-racist and anti-gun--the NRA must HATE this movie. With the sole exception of Fraser the cast is great. Everybody explodes--especially Bullock (in a GREAT scene), Dillon, Phillippe and Howard. I only give this a 9 because, towards the end, the plotting becomes clumsy and there are way too many unlikely situations. Still worth catching.Now--as for the Oscar controversy saying that this stole the Oscar from 'Brokeback Mountain'. Not really. (For the record, I'm a gay man). 'Brokeback' was long, slow, boring and depressing. Also some Academy members said (AFTER the awards) that they hadn't seen 'Brokeback' and had no intention of watching a gay love story. Also 'Crash' was simply a better movie. Still I don't think it deserved an Academy Award for Best Picture--it's not THAT good. But it didn't steal it from 'Brokeback'.",9,1,7,8 April 2006
Snatch," Non-stop
","Great, very funny, very fast motion picture.  The plot is way too convoluted to get into and there are too many characters, but the movie never stops moving, the cast is rearing to go and the snappy editing and direction keep this thing going full force.  A few sequences don't work and the movie does come to a screeching halt every once and a while, but all in all, a great film.  See and enjoy!",8,1,6,20 February 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Cold but impressive
","Black BLACK satire by Stanley Kubrick about nuclear war. I hated this the first time I saw it--but I've since revised my opinion. I can see why I didn't like this at first. Even though it's a satire it's full of very unlikable, totally crazy characters. It's shot in stark black & white and I still don't find the idea of nuclear war very funny. Also Kubrick has always been a very 'cold' director--he seems very cynical in all his movies and they have a cruel, detached view to them (especially '2001'). This is no exception but I have to admit it is (in its way) a masterpiece.It's never dull, has some incredibly funny moments (Sellers conversations with the Russian premier are hysterical) and moves like lightning. The cast is just great--George C. Scott enjoyably goes barreling out of control as the military leader; Sterling Hayden is just great as the guy who starts the war; even Slim Pickens was good! And this was James Earl Jones' first film.But this film belongs to Peter Sellers--he plays three different roles and he's magnificent in all of them. He plays each one completely different and does a great job constantly. Just unbelievable.So...I still find the film a little too cold and don't find it particularly funny but it IS a masterpiece. I give it a 10.",10,2,6,26 September 2004
The Bodyguard," A boring mess
","**POSSIBLE MINOR PLOT SPOILERS** Superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is receiving death threats and fears for her life. She hires a high-priced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner). They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously, it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousy--full of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout (but that DOES fit his character). Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singer--but she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits (especially 'I Will Always Love You') but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards (for the music). So, use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo.",2,7,13,5 March 2008
Scary Movie 2," Not up to the original
","This sequel (to a movie that promised 'no sequel') opens with an uproarious parody of 'The Exorcist' (with James Woods) then goes downhill fast.  The 'plot' has a bunch of college students (four returnees from the original--never mind that they died--and three untalented others) spending the weekend in a haunted house for some reason or another.  They get to the house, the plot goes out the window and it's a non-stop barrage of crude humor and countless parodies of other movies.  The big problems with this movie is the plot ceases to make sense halfway through, there are more bad jokes than good ones and the cast members are either annoying (Tori Spelling and especially Chris Elliot) or wasted (Tim Curry--why Tim?).  The jokes do ocassionally work, but this seems much longer than 80 minutes.  Too bad--the opening was so good.",5,0,3,9 July 2001
MASH," Almost classic comedy
","Basis for the very long-running TV series 'MASH'.It's an absurdest, surrealistic view of a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) stationed in Korea. It primarily involves the antics of three surgeons in the unit played by Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould and Tom Skeritt. It's a very episodic film that shows that people in order are complete idiots and everyone working for them knows it. This was made in 1970 and making fun of authority figures was very popular then.This film is easily one of Robert Altman's best. It moves quickly (the 2 hours speed by), has a GREAT cast and has his trademark overlapping dialogue--yet you hear exactly what you're supposed to (somehow). It seems strange but this movie has you laughing while showing you graphic operating room sequences (which are cut down in the PG version). The antics of these guys are very immature and childish--but that's how these guys keep their sanity. Despite myself I was laughing. A highlight was when one man intends to commit suicide--take a look at the 'Last Supper' he has.I don't totally like this movie because Altman's sexism comes roaring through twice. The character of Major 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (Sally Kellerman) is treated horribly. While she is having sex at one point the guys slip a mike under her bed and broadcast it to the whole camp. That's not funny. Even worse is when they rig the shower curtain to fly up while she's in it--it publicly, humiliatingly exposes her. Seeing her crying and screaming while trying to crawl away nude is not funny just sick. I've seen this multiple times in movie houses and no one has ever laughed at either scene. They're just too cruel and Altman seems to enjoy it. Kellerman deserves credit for maintaining her dignity despite these sequences.Because of those scenes I can only give this a 9. Still, this is mostly a great comedy. Much better than the later TV show.",9,1,3,16 July 2005
Final Destination 2," As bad as the first--possibly worse
","A woman (A.J. Cook) has premonitions about a horrendous car accident before it happens. She manages to save some people from the accident...but Death won't be cheated and goes after the ones who were supposed to die.The same silly premise as the first one used--it was interesting once, but gets really silly the second time around. The opening car disaster is great--exciting, violent and bloody. Also the killings later on are also violent, bloody and (sometimes) amusing. There's one good performance (by Cook) and an interesting connection to the first movie...but that's about it. Otherwise it's horribly acted with boring dialogue and characters and situations that get more and more unlikely.Do yourself a favor...wait for it on DVD/video and just fast forward through it for the killings. That's the only worthwhile parts of the movie.",2,1,6,20 February 2003
Alien," Very overrated--boring
","SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!How this is considered a classic is beyond me.  I saw it when it first came out in 1979.  I was 16--I was basically bored or disgusted by it.  22 years later my opinion hasn't changed.  Why do I hate this?  Let me count the ways:1) The plot is old hat.  It's basically a haunted house movie set in outer space.2)  There is zero characterization.  The crew members are virtually interchangable.  How can you care about somebody getting killed when you don't know who they are?3)  Getting a bunch of talented actors and giving them nothing to work with.4)  Overdone set design.  Yes, it's impressive but it overwhelms what little plot there is.  Nice set design does not make a movie.5)  People stumble around in dark corridors and dark rooms looking for a cat.  Not once but TWICE!  And this is after they know there's a killer alien on board!6)  What the hell is a cat doing on a space mission?  7)  The characters act incredibly stupid.8)  The alien looks dumb--it's just a guy in a slightly modified alligator suit.  Cool set of double teeth though.9)  What does the alien do with its victims?  Two of them just disappear.10)  Why is the alien killing them?  What reason?  We're never given one. Oh wait--because it's in the script.  That's why!11)  Sigourney Weaver strips to down to her underwear for no reason whatsoever at the end.12)  IT'S DULL!!!!!!!!The only scene that works is the chest burster with John Hurt--but that's only a minute or two in a two hour film.  Long, dull and stupid.  I give this a 1--I wish I could go lower--it deserves a 0.  Avoid at all costs. See 'Aliens' instead.  That's 100 times better than this.",1,104,302,12 March 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," It's OK
","Film version of the play. Based on fact it tells the story of a man (Johnny Depp) who is jailed (for no good reason) for 15 years. It was done by slimy Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) because he wanted his wife and child. 15 years later he returns, adopts the name Sweeney Todd and sets out for vengeance. He's helped by Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) who uses the meat from his victims to put into her meat pies which become VERY popular.I saw the play back in 1980 with Angela Landsbury and George Hearn. I remember loving it and the acting was superb. This version just doesn't match up--it can't! Tim Burton correctly shoots it in seriously drained color and he gets a superb performance by Depp and young Ed Sanders (as Toby). Everybody can sing too. Also the murders are shown with blood gushing out--once onto the camera lens! Still it's impossible to take them seriously. Still this has its drawbacks. Carter is terrible--she can sing but her acting is pretty dreadful. Rickman has done the evil act once too often--and it shows. Also it's depressing! It wears you down running on for two full hours. Some songs were cut out too--I really miss 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'. So--it's not a disaster but it could have been so much better with a different leading lady and not cutting ANY of the songs. Depp really puts this film across though--for him alone I give this a 7.",7,1,9,12 January 2008
The Polar Express," Kids will like it
","A young boy doesn't believe in Santa Claus at all. On Christmas Eve a huge, magical locomotive pulls in front of his house. The conductor (Tom Hanks) tells him to get on--they're going to the North Pole. It seems the train is full of kids who don't believe in Santa. Well...that's about to change.This is not a live action film. The characters look like humans (Tom Hanks has FIVE roles) and sound like them but are clearly computer-generated. In fact the whole movie is like that--EVERYTHING is computer generated. I saw it in an IMAX 3D theatre. I admit the visuals were incredible (if somewhat creepy)---but I really didn't like it.There's very little plot, no characterization and I was basically bored silly. The 'adventures' on the express didn't impress me and there's a pointlessly long episode with three of the kids lost in Santa's town (or whatever--we're never told what it is). Tons of characters and situations are left unexplored or unexplained and it gets annoying. The waiters on the train serving hot chocolate had me going 'huh'? Also the meaning of the film (believe in Christmas) is heavy-handed even for a kids movie. They go out of their way to make you cry and choke up---I found it overly manipulative. Basically you just sit there and are bombarded by tons of visual tricks. For some people, that's enough. For me I needed more. The actors voicing the figures do pretty good except for Eddie Deezen--his voice is INCREDIBLY annoying (as is his character).So I didn't like it--I looked at my watch more than once. Still the kids in the theatre were spellbound--they sat there in silence watching the screen. So--I think kids will like it but, to be honest, I think some kids might get nightmares from this. These CGI characters look so strange. More than once I was feeling very uneasy looking at them. Adults MIGHT enjoy it. I give it a 6--and that's mostly for the visuals.",6,4,8,4 December 2004
The Best Years of Our Lives," Good but not great
","The stories of three men (Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Harold Russell) returning home from WWII and having problems readjusting to civilian life. Andrews has to deal with dissatisfied wife Virginia Mayo; March has to adjust to being back with wife Myrna Loy and their two grown children; Russell has had his hands blown off in war (he was played by non-actor Russell who really had lost his hands in the war).I first saw this back in the 1980s at a revival theatre. I remember being totally bored and fighting to stay awake. I think I was too young to appreciate it. Years later I started watching it casually on TV--and liked it. I was almost never bored and the stories pulled me in. It is exceptionally well directed by William Wyler and virtually the entire cast is flawless. The women in the movie actually give the best performances. Loy, Mayo and Theresa Wright are all just great. Andrews also was very good. March, however, came across as very unsympathetic and Russell was terrible (but he never was an actor).However it's way too long--three hours is a bit much. This movie could easily lose an hour. And this movie was (for its time) relevant and pretty shocking. Today it still is relevant (sadly with the war we have now) but no longer shocking. I found many of the situations contrived and forced and there were some REALLY unbelievable happy endings all around. Still this should be seen for just the acting and directing alone.A good film but no masterpiece. I give it an 8.",8,7,21,17 December 2005
The Town," Very very good but not great
","This takes place in Charlestown--a small city in Boston. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is the leader of a gang of bank robbers. It was a tradition passed down to him by his father (Chris Cooper). At one robbery he falls in love with the manager of the bank named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). He starts to romance her NOT letting on he's a robber. His trigger happy gang member friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) is not happy. Meanwhile FBI Special Aggent Adam Frawley (Joe Hamm) is on hot on his trail.Ben Affleck (who co-wrote, stars in and directs) was born and raised in Cambridge--a suburb of Boston. He knows the city and towns inside out and puts his knowledge to good use. I was born and raised near Boston too and it was fun to see it on the big screen. He correctly uses locations unlike other movies (1994's 'Blown Away' had Boston City Hall used as the police department which caused a LOT of laughter when I saw it). He KNOWS how to direct--he uses slow-motion, different pitches of sound and never slows down. There are three exciting fast car chases in the movie which are incredible to watch. The one through the tiny streets of the North End must have been a nightmare to block and clear. There are also tons of shootouts but they (thankfully) aren't that bloody and there's a big explosive ending at Fenway Park. So why is this very very good but not great? The plot. It's been done millions of times before. There are no surprises here and it turns into more of a character study than an action movie. But it's well-acted and extremely well-directed so you're never really bored (even though it does have its slow spots).Affleck easily gives his best performance EVER here. He flawlessly captures the Charlestown accent and his character is multi-layered and sympathetic. Hall doesn't have too much to work with but she's very good and beautiful. Hamm (who can be good) is just so-so in his role. He looks terrible and sometimes just seems to be going by the numbers in terms of acting. The biggest surprise is Renner. He has the meatiest role (the psycho gang member) and he UNDER plays it...and not very well. He seems muted and is always pulling back. Maybe he was directed that way but it doesn't work. There also Blake Lively as his sister. Her accent is a BIT too strong at times but she's very good.A very very good movie. Just not for kids. There's tons of swearing and has strong violence. I give it an 8.",8,3,7,26 September 2010
Closer," Despressing but fascinating
","Grim look at two relationships and how they interact and change over the course of a few years. There's Dan (Jude Law) who seems to love young Alice (Natalie Portman). He also seems to love Anna (Julia Roberts) but she ends up with Larry (Clive Owen).A lot of people seem to hate this film a lot...probably because it's way too realistic. It's grim and has no comedy or light moments at all. The entire cast consists of those four actors--there's no small supporting roles at all. It was (pretty obviously) based on a play and sometimes sounds like a play. Some of the characters make speeches instead of talking to each other. Still I love this film. It's beautifully directed and has some very sharp but truthful observations about love, life and relationships. Almost the entire cast is excellent. Owen and Portman are easily the best actors here. Every line they say rings true. They also share a VERY sexually explicit (in terms of dialogue) sequence that is painful to watch but necessary for the film. Law is just OK in his role. He's not bad but he's not up to Owen and Portman. Roberts unfortunately is pretty terrible. She always has this blank look on her face and is unemotional to a ridiculous degree. Still, her aside, I recommend this film and find it one of the most truthful films I've ever seen on relationships. However be warned--it has VERY sexually graphic dialogue and is not a fun film to watch.",8,2,4,28 July 2010
Suicide Squad," Not good but I enjoyed it.
","A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7.",7,2,6,14 August 2016
Taxi Driver," Come on! A masterpiece? I think not.
","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a Vietnam war veteran who drives a cab in NYC. NYC is shown as an utter hellhole--full of unpleasant characters and events. He tries to romance classy rich Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) but shocks her instead. He meets 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) and decides to save her from her sadistic pimp (Harvey Keitel).I've seen this multiple times over the years and it's always escaped me why people find this a masterpiece. It's slow, boring and pointless. I mean really--what was Scorsese trying to show or tell us with this movie? We just spend two hours watching a sick pathetic man and his final explosion of violence. And the point is...? There are credibility gaps galore--when he first takes out Betsy he takes her to see a porno movie! No way is he so dumb that he's take a classy woman like her to that. He shoots four (I believe) guys dead to 'save' Iris yet is never punished for the crime. And just why was he trying to save her? She didn't ask him. Why not just report it to the police? This deserves just one star but the acting of Keitel and especially De Niro and Foster adds some points. Only for those who enjoy wallowing in sick unpleasant situations and characters for no good reason for two hours.",4,8,27,24 April 2009
Shutter Island," Very good but you need patience
","This takes place in 1954 on an island off the coast of Massachusetts that has a hospital for mentally disturbed patients. Federal marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) go there to find out how a mentally disturbed patient escaped from her cell. The head doctor (Ben Kingsley) seems to want to help--but bars them too. As the search increases Teddy has hallucinations and horrendous nightmares. He slowly starts to suspect that there's a LOT going on that he knows nothing about.Martin Scorsese's thriller has received rave reviews and is a big success at the box office--but this demands a lot from viewers. To be totally honest I was getting bored after the first hour. The constant hallucinations and dreams that DiCaprio has came at you nonstop with no explanation. I realized later on that there was a REASON for this but it's frustrating at first. Then, during the last 45 minutes or so, the twists and turns come fast and furious and totally mesmerized me. I realized the slow pace and images at the beginning where that way for a reason--but you have to force your way through it (at first). The acting is superb--no one is bad but DiCaprio and Kingsley are excellent. DiCaprio has played this part before but he's just excellent in a VERY disturbing sequence toward the end (you'll know it when you see it). The directing is excellent (of course) and the cinematography is perfect. So--it is slow and a little too long--but that's all needed for the story. This might actually improve with multiple viewings. I give it a 7.",7,1,5,27 February 2010
Tangled," GREAT CGI Disney film!
","Disney takes the tale of Repunzel and makes a few changes. Repunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) is taken away from her royal parents at an early age. She was kidnapped by Mother Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy) because Rapunzel's long golden hair helped keep her young (it's complicated but the movie explains it). She keeps Rapunzel in a tower warning her to NEVER go outside. Then robber Flynn Ryder (voice of Zachery Levi) gets into the tower and gets Rapunzel out. Then a series of fantastic (but fun) adventures take place.First off I should mention I saw this in 2-D NOT 3-D (I refuse to pay $15.50 for an animated feature). Still I LOVED it. It's Disney's first (I think) GCI feature and it works beautifully. The characters look real and the settings are incredible. It's like one of the best Pixar features. The script is fast and funny with jokes that mange to appeal to the kids AND adults equally. The voices match the characters expertly and I got a BIG kick out of Flynn Ryder (obviously modeled after Errol Flynn). There are also two CGI animals--Pascal (a chameleon) and Maximus (a horse)--that are hysterical! They don't talk but their facial expressions alone had me laughing out loud! It IS PG for some (very mild) violence but I don't think it would bother the kids. The little girl sitting behind me couldn't have been more than 6 and it didn't bother her at all! It was fast, funny and full of adventure and humor! I was never bored for one second. A 10 all the way!!!",10,7,10,30 December 2010
Barry Lyndon," In my mind THIS is Kubrick's best film
","Excellent movie about Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) in 18th century England. He's a poor man who marries a rich widow (Marisa Benenson) and tries to assume her husband's place. However it all ends tragically.Many people hate this film. They think it's too long (3 hours+) and boring (when saw it at a revival house years ago most of the audience left during the intermission!). However I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best film. I was never bored once. The scenery is just gorgeous, the story engrossing and (surprisingly) O'Neal gives an excellent performance. The story does move at a deliberate (meaning slow) pace but that's needed to understand the characters and situations. If you're looking for a quick loud movie with lots of action this isn't for you. However if you're looking for a beautifully made and intricate film about a man's rise and downfall this is for you. I especially love that this doesn't assume that the audience is a bunch of idiots--the narration explains the events calmly and clearly without talking down to you. Easily Kubrick's best film ever. MUCH better than the wildly overrated '2001'. A 10 all the way.",10,5,10,20 May 2009
Interstellar," Long, dull and WAY overpraised
","A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick ('2001') here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious 'logic' served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.",1,55,120,13 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great special effects...that's it
","Okay, it's better than episode 1, but how can it not be? Episode 1 was kiddie drivel...this isn't. Still, it's far from great.This follows the future Darth Vader, Anakin (Hayden Christeensen) training to be a Jedi under Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his romance with Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Also the Dark Force is slowly gaining power across the galaxy.The special effects are superb--truly eye-popping and the action sequences are long, very fast and loads of fun. However, the script is slow, confusing and boring, the dialogue is impossibly bad and there's some truly horrendous acting.There is some good acting by McGregor, Portman and Christopher Lee (as Count Dooku) but that's it. Christensen is just terrible as Anakin--very stiff and unemotional. His attempts at showing his dark side peeking through are laughable--he comes across as a spoiled little brat, not the evil Darth Vader. Also his romance scenes with Portman are destined to become camp classics. The dialogue is just the worst I've ever heard in my life--Lucas can't write!!!! These scenes were filmed in impossibly beautiful settings. There was one point when Portman was running through a field on a beautiful sunny day. I half expected her to start belting out 'The Sound of Music'! The dialogue really kills this film. It's all bad--either stupid or boring or predictable. It's on the level of a bad Archie comic book. And why did they bring back Jar Jar Binks? He's STILL annoying.So it's worth seeing for the special effects--bring ear plugs for the dialogue.",5,2,6,13 June 2002
Corpse Bride," It was OK
","Tim Burton's second stop-motion animation movie (following 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'). Meek, mild and VERY thin Victor Van Dort (voice of Johnny Depp) is going to marry beautiful Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson)...but he's not sure if he's ready for marriage. He (accidentally) puts his wedding ring on the finger of a skeleton's hand. This reanimates the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) who assumes he wants to marry her! And it's a musical too! As you can see this is pretty silly--but stories are never very strong in Tim Burton movies. The visuals are the first concern and they ARE incredible. The animation is flawless--the characters move fluidly and some of the sets are really incredible. There's also tons of visual gags (my favorite is when Victor tells the skeleton dog to roll over...and play dead) and the songs are actually not bad--the score from Danny Elfman is great and there's a skeleton song and dance that stops the movie. But I didn't really like it.I found it slow...even at 75 minutes (I dozed off at one point!) and all the sets are (purposely) very gloomy in dark colors--the film looks like it was shot in black & white at times. It fit the story but started to wear down on me--I was getting depressed! The jokes really don't work--some do but most just sit there. The total lack of logic in the plot began to annoy me--there was a twist at the end that I thought was particularly contrived. However the voices DID fit the characters and it was interesting to look at. But I need more than visuals to keep me interested. If you're a Tim Burton fan you'll probably love this--but I can only truthfully give it a 6.",6,5,16,1 October 2005
Romeo + Juliet," MTV meets Shakespeare
","Updating of 'Romeo and Juliet' for the 1990s. I'm going to skip a synopsis of the plot--everyone knows it. This is basically 'Romeo and Juliet' in modern day dress full of arresting visuals, gunplay, loud 1990s music, wild dance numbers with all the cast members using Shakespeare's original dialogue! The effect is odd (to say the least). It ALMOST works. The visuals are all incredible (director Buz Luhrmann always knows how to make a film look fantastic) and the movie almost never stops for a breath. That's the problem--at first it's fun, but after 2 hours you're exhausted. Also the actors seem lost. When they're talking Shakespeare they seem to have no idea what they're saying. Most of them just recite the lines with a blank look on their faces. The older actors (Paul Sorvino especially) are much better at it. The casting and acting in this is all over the place.Leonardo DiCaprio (as Romeo) is a good actor, but he's just all wrong for this role. He looks lost and way out of his depth. However, Claire Danes is wonderful as Juliet. Very sweet, likable and seems to have a clear understanding of the dialogue. Also her reactions in her dancing scene with Paris are hilarious. John Leguizamo is way over the top as Tybalt--too much. He quickly becomes annoying. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino are very good as Montague and Capulet but are underused. Even Paul Rudd is very good (and incredibly handsome) as Paris. He seems to be having a whale of a time in his role.Also, there is an incredible party sequence and Romeo's cousin comes in a wig, dress and lipstick and no one bats an eyelash. There's a great musical number on a huge staircase also.Loud, eye-popping, funny and even quite moving. As it stands, I'm giving it an 8. With a better cast I might give it a 10.Best line: 'Check on me tomorrow and you'll find me a grave man.'",8,14,26,1 July 2002

This isn't as funny as 'Toy Story 1' or '2' but what is?

Bridget Jones's Diary," Worth seeing for Zellweger
","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, a Londoner, and panicking about being single.  She falls for her cold, commitment-phobic boss (Hugh Grant) and finds herself somewhat attracted to tall, handsome, arrogant Darcy (Colin Firth).  Who should she go with?  Three guesses.  Predictable storyline overcome by a sharp script, fun soundtrack and a VERY energetic performance by Zellweger.  It's her film all the way and she's just fantastic.  She fakes a British accent to perfection and carries the whole movie on her shoulders.  Also it's interesting to see Hugh Grant play a total jerk and do a very good job of it--he's played the innocent, bumbling Englishman way too often.  However, there are two very bad performances--James Callis as Bridgets' gay best friend Tom.  The guy is so obviously straight I didn't believe him for one second--but he's a minor character so it really didn't hurt the film.  What did was Colin Firth's performance.  He's tall, he's handsome, he's WOODEN!  He always has a frown on his face and is SO serious...you wonder what Bridget sees in him.  It's surprising because Firth is a good actor...just not this time around.  So it's worth seeing for Zellweger...this might be the film that makes her a well-deserved star.  A perfect date movie.",8,3,5,30 April 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," Surprisingly dull
","Based on the comic book. In the 1940s Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is deemed unfit for military service being too small and frail. He takes part in an experiment that makes him tall, ridiculously muscular and possessing almost superhuman strength. He joins the army and helps them battle the evil Nazi the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).I heard a lot of good things about this movie and was surprised to see how dull it was. It takes far too long setting up the back story and Cap doesn't show up until 30 minutes in. I don't mind slow movies but this was deadly dull. The movie drones on and on and moves in fits and starts. I never got involved in the characters or the story. Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood (to get the all important PG-13 rating). The special effects are good but don't help that much. Evans is OK as Captain America but he comes off as sort of dull. He never shows any range of emotion. Hayley Atwell walks through her role as Peggy Carter. She's not a bad actress but she's given nothing to work with. Tommy Lee Jones gives yet another bad performance as an Army colonel. He can do this part in his sleep--and he does! Weaving sneers his way through his role and plays the Red Skull as a one-dimensional evil man. Only Dominic Cooper(as Howard Stark) and Sebastian Stan (as Bucky) give good performances. This isn't the worst comic book movie ever (that award goes to 'Green Lantern') but it's slow and dull. I give this a 4.",4,12,29,1 August 2011
American Hustle," Way over praised
","This takes place in 1978. A con man named Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his assistant Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) get involved with a crooked FBI man (Bradley Cooper) and get involved with the Mafia and various politicians.This movie has been hyped to the heavens as being one of the best films of 2013. Please! This is an over indulgent, sloppy and confusing mess. It starts off by throwing us right in the middle of the story with no explanations of who anyone is or what's going on. This goes on for 30 SOLID MINUTES! I literally dozed off because I was so bored and confused! Then they go back and start from the beginning. What exactly was the point of the opening 30 minutes? The story itself is somewhat interesting but it's very slow and confusing. There are so many double-crosses it's hard to keep track of what's going on. Also one of the very nice characters (played by Jeremy Renner) is treated horribly. On the plus side there's a great soundtrack of 70s music and they got the styles and fashions of the era down to a T. The acting is for the most part good. Bale is admirably slimy and Cooper is having lots of fun in his role. Adams I couldn't quite get a grasp on. Her character is difficult to figure out but that may be the point. Jennifer Lawrence is easily the best actor here. As Irving's wife she's loud, aggressive, beautiful (in a way) and VERY funny. However, all in all, I was pretty bored and underwhelmed by what I saw. Why this is getting praised to the high heavens is beyond me.",4,10,20,2 February 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," Just great teen update of 'Taming of the Shrew'
","At Pardu High School young perky sophomore Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) wants to date--but her overprotective father (Larry Miller) won't let her until her older sister Katerina (Julia Stiles) dates. Problem is Katerina hates everybody! Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wants to date Bianca and hires tough boy Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) to date Katerina. Trouble is Patrick falls for Katerina...I can't believe I'm giving a 10 to a teen comedy (I'm in my 40s!) but I loved this! It's bright, full of color, quick with many interesting characters and some absolutely hysterical one liners. I laughed out loud more than once! The script is sharp and just great--it updates Shakespeare's play in a very affectionate manner.The acting is just perfect. Stiles has already proved she's a good actress--she plays the comedy and drama to perfection. Oleynik is perfect as her younger sister--she could have been too perky but she wasn't. Gordon-Levitt is touching in his role. Allison Janney has a few hysterical bits as guidance counselor Ms. Perky and Andrew Keegan plays the drop dead handsome but obnoxious jerk Joey Donner very well--his verbal fights with Stiles really work! Ledger is just OK.There's also a great soundtrack and some truly funny outtakes during the closing credits along with the band Letters from Cleo belting out a song on top of the school! The only negative I have is that there was a bit too much swearing and sexual innuendo for a PG-13 movie. Still, I loved this movie from beginning to end--funny and moving. Highly recommended!",10,4,5,4 May 2007
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great but a little too long
","Movie about Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) lead singer of Queen. It follows him from 1970 to 1985 and how he became part of Queen till his tragic death in 1991 of AIDS.In some ways this is a great movie. It's well-directed by Bryan Singer and has almost all of the bands best songs. Also Malek is good as Mercury. He sounds, looks and acts like him. Also it doesn't ignore the fact that Mercury was gay. However it's just too damn long. It runs 135 minutes and could have easily run at 120 minutes. Sequences go on far too long and it gets dull. Still it IS worth seeing.Malek also won numerous awards (including the Academy Award) for his performance. As I said he's great but I don't think he's that great.",8,4,6,6 December 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," It's pretty good
",Based (very loosely) on a true story. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is sent to Saigon in 1965. He's a radio DJ and is sent there to boost the morale of the troops. His off the wall manner on the radio and jokes make him very popular--but he meets opposition from obnoxious Sgt. Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) and stupid Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). Then he falls in love with a Vietnamese woman and realizes he can't just ignore the violence all around him.This was a huge hit in 1987. This is the movie that made Williams a star. I loved it back then but not so much now. Williams' rantings on the radio really aren't that funny--the sequence where he entertains servicemen outside on trucks going off to combat has more laughs than anything else. Also this move shoves its sentimentality down your throat (it's no surprise this is a Disney picture). We hear these beautiful songs of the period over scenes of revolution and violence. Everything is painted in black and white. Walsh and Kirby are one-dimensional villains and Williams comes across as almost perfect.The acting is all good and Williams non-stop comedy bits are occasionally funny. But this movie just about grabs you by the throat and forces you to cry and just pours on the syrup. Worth seeing but no great shakes.,7,1,2,13 February 2007
American Pie," Gee--isn't sexual humiliation so much fun?????
","Dreadful 'comedy' that was (sadly) a huge hit. It's about a bunch of idiot high school guys (all who are clearly in their 20s) trying to have sex before they graduate. That's it. Seriously! That's the whole plot! Now you COULD make an OK film out of this idea (maybe) but this film doesn't even try. It just thinks up every single way a guy can be sexually humiliated and/or appear pathetic and throws it at the audience full force. Hey, why be subtle? Jason Biggs especially is made to look like the most pathetic loser I've ever seen. I suppose the actor DOES deserve credit for humiliating himself again and again. He has sex with a pie, drinks a drink with sperm in it, has premature ejaculation TWICE (which his whole school sees), has his parents catch him with a full erection, does a truly stupid dance to turn a girl on which are his friends playing a joke on him...are you laughing hysterically yet? If any of those above antics make you crack up you might like this movie. Obviously many people did. I just found it stupid, offensive, cruel and pathetic with a disturbing mean streak running through it. The sole bright spot in this is Alyson Hannigan who gives the ONE good performance.Mean, stupid and very unfunny. A 1 all the way.",1,6,17,8 August 2007
Watchmen," An exhausting movie but fascinating
","This is an adaptation of Alan Moore's great graphic novel. It takes place in an alternate universe in the 1980s when Richard Nixon is still president. Super hero groups have been outlawed by the president. The former Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is savagely killed. Another hero named Rorschah (Jackie Earle Haley) investigates and notices former super heroes AND villains are being killed. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) also know something is up. And the blue (and frequently nude) Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) sees something apocalyptic approaching...If you haven't read the novel you might have a problem with this. There's WAY too much happening in the book to cram into one movie so this moves through characters and situations at light speed. Some subplots are dropped completely and the depressing tone of the book is lightened. There's also some pretty funny lines added to lighten things up. My favorites came when the main villain says, 'I'm not some comic book super villain' and someone says (when it's mentioned Ronald Reagan might be running for president), 'Nobody wants a cowboy as a president'. Even with the changes this might confuse people who haven't read the book. I've read it multiple times so I wasn't confused. I went with a friend who never read it and she wasn't confused either! I guess it just depends on the person.The movie is 165 minutes--it's long but I was never bored. The visuals are impressive and the special effects are just great. I was exhausted and depressed by the end of the movie but I love it. It's that rarity--an adult film not dumbed down for teenagers. Yes, it involves super heroes in silly costumes (Nite Owl II in particular) but the fights aren't fun. They're violent, VERY bloody and brutal...especially when the Comedian gets involved. He enjoys the violence and the film shows him going full blast. There's also a rape scene which is actually more upsetting than the bloody battles! The only fight sequence that wasn't too bloody or upsetting was when Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II invade a prison and basically knock down about 30 or 40 prisoners in a few minutes! Fights aside this is also a mystery about what's going on and why. It's well-done and keeps you guessing till the end. Then there's nudity--there's plenty of nude full-frontal shots of Dr. Manhattan. But seriously--what's the problem? It's a penis. So what? Every guy has one! Supposedly this has upset people but the movie IS R rated and it fits the character. When I saw it my audience was dead quiet. Nobody seemed bothered or unnerved by it. If you're so prudish that a nude guy bothers you then perhaps you shouldn't see the movie. Great soundtrack too.The acting is excellent. Morgan has the hardest role but he pulls it off. Wilson and Ackerman are sympathetic and nice without becoming TOO syrupy. As for Crudup I can't say how good he is. It's his voice but Manhattan is all CGI. All I'll say is that his voice matches the character. Haley is good too but his voice was way too caustic for the character. Carla Gugino also shines in a supporting role. Only Matthew Goode (as Ozymandies) disappoints. He seems to be holding back for some reason...but he's not in the movie much.So a very violent, long and adult super hero movie. It's not for everybody but I was fascinated. A 10 all the way.",10,5,11,25 March 2009
Baby Driver," Good gangster film
","Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a young 20 something who is a driver for crimes committed by sadistic gangster Doc (Kevin Spacey). He's playing back Doc for trying to rob him years ago. He finally pays him back and Doc says he's free. He meets beautiful Debora (Lily James) and wants to run away with her. However Doc calls him back for one final job...or else.There's a lot of great things about this film. The soundtrack is fantastic; the action is violent and incredible (this MUST be seen on a big screen); the plot complex; Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx are terrifying but terrific in supporting roles; James is beautiful and sympathetic and the film has a satisfying ending.However I have issues with it too. It's too long (over two hours); slow-moving; full of unpleasant characters; tons of swearing and an ending which goes on too long. One character keeps coming back from almost certain death so many times it got comical. Most critically though I found Elgort terrible. I didn't know how to react to his character and got thoroughly annoyed with his blank line readings. With a better actor I might have liked this better. As it stands I can only give it a 7.",7,3,7,4 July 2017
Justice League," GREAT super-hero movie
","Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers together Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to battle Steppenwolf (CGI). He's a being from Darkseid to get three boxes on Earth to get total control.Quick (only 2 hours), fast and basically lots of fun. After the disaster that was 'Batman vs. Superman' I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. There's plenty of action and carton-like violence but no blood or gore. The plot is easy to understand and there's welcome doses of humor. There's also great acting by Affleck and Gadot. However there are minuses. Fisher is blank as Cyborg. Miller is neither cute nor charming--just annoying. Also turning Aquaman into a bad-ass was a spectacularly stupid idea. Also Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) and Diane Lane (as Ma Kent) were woefully underused. Still I loved the movie. Also, as always, wait for a cool little sequence after the closing credits.",7,3,7,18 November 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent
","Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!",10,23,29,3 January 2002
Man of Steel," Very OK
","Redo of Superman. Superman (Henry Cavill) was rocketed from Krypton when he was a baby and lands on Earth. Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane, Kevin Costner) find him and bring him up. He realizes he has strange powers but his parents tell him to control his impulses. Then evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) invades Earth and demands that Superman surrender himself...or else. There's more to the plot but it makes little sense (if you think about it).This IS well-made with great special effects and all but it's not that good. Basically it suffers from overkill. The movie is far too long--there was no reason for this movie to last almost 150 minutes. The opening on Krypton is too long also. The last hour is virtually non-stop destruction and fighting which quickly gets boring instead of exciting. Also TONS of product placement is apparent during it. The script is all over the place. It's constantly trying to tie Clark being an alien and growing up in the USA--and it doesn't work at all. Characters appear (and are given no introduction) and disappear without rhyme or reason. Gaps in the plot too. Acting doesn't help. Cavill is tall, handsome and muscular as Superman--and also sort of a blank. Amy Adams is even worse as Lois Lane. She tries but the material isn't there for her. Even worse her and Cavill have zero sexual chemistry so their romance seems more than a little forced. Shannon spends the whole movie snarling and yelling. And, worst of all, Superman commits an act at the end of the movie that Superman would NEVER do! All in all this is OK--nothing more.",6,18,32,23 June 2013
Grease," Well....the songs are good
","Dreadful mish-mash. A musical about sweet, lovable Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) in love with hood Danny Zuko (John Travolta). Tedious and predictable complications ensure. It all ends up with Sandy deciding to become a tramp (she's wearing a skin-tight leather outfit at the end) to get the man she loves. Great message to the girls in America--you can't get the guy you love by being sweet so be a tramp and you'll get him.I've never liked this movie. With a few exceptions the actors REALLY overact to an embarrassing degree. The guys who played the T Birds were particularly annoying--they acted like a bunch of hyperactive fourth graders. The dance numbers (I'm being charitable to call them that) are disasters. Except for the prom dance they're all over the place. Especially during the 'Summer Nights' number--it seems like everybody is dancing to totally different songs! The script has Mickey Mouse dialogue and is chockful of crude stupid jokes (most of which are edited out of the TV prints). There are a few things that save this from total disaster. Newton-John is very sweet and pretty as Sandy. Travolta overacts--but in an engaging way. Jeff Conaway as his best buddy is very good. Also Stockard Channing (who was 30 when she made this) is on target as Rizzo. She also gets a chance to belt out her own number 'There Are Worse Things I Could Do'. Also the songs are great--'Summer Nights', 'Hopelessly Devoted to You', 'You're the One That I Want', 'Greased Lightning'... Too bad they're all so ineptly staged. I have seen the movie multiple times--but only as camp. It's something I just watch and wonder at. How did something so badly done get to be such a big hit? Channing herself has openly said she hates the movie. And I find the message this movie gives to be very troubling.I give it a 5 but that's only for the music and some of the acting. As a movie this rates a 1.",1,18,34,3 December 2005
Footloose," Sure it's silly but it's an 80s teen musical
","Teenager Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small mid Western town with his mom after his parents divorce. It seems the Reverend Moore (John Lithgow), of the town's only church, has totally banned rock and roll music from the entire town. He has a daughter named Ariel (Lori Singer) who is basically a hell-raiser--yet loves her father. Rem decides to stop the ban and bring the town back to life.OK--we're not dealing with reality here at ALL! A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon, Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school students--Singer was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But, as a no brain musical, this does work.The opening sequence alone is great (it shows various feet dancing to the title tune). Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just great--he doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number (to a song called 'Never') which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friend--his learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wife--Wiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow (wisely) does not play the Reverend as a one-note character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.So--this is no 'Singin in the Rain' but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!",8,58,91,6 April 2005
28 Weeks Later," As good as the original
",This takes place 7 months after London had been ravaged by a virus that turned people into flesh-eating monsters. Now they're all believed to be dead and some new communities are being set up in certain sections of London. But things slowly go wrong and a new outbreak threatens to occur...The plot may sound kind of vague but I don't want to give it away. If you liked the first one you'll like this. Like the first it's grim and (after a slow start) VERY graphic with extreme blood and gore. The acting is good all across the board and this film has no letup--there's no jokes to lessen the tension. No exactly a fun night at the movies but great for horror fans.My only complaints--I got tired of the nonstop jumpy camera during the attacks (you don't know WHAT'S going on a few times) and the ending was sort of puzzling.Still it's grim and graphic--powerful stuff. I give it an 8.,8,5,12,28 May 2007
The Thing," Right up there with 'Halloween'--one of Carpenter's best!
","Remake of the classic 1951 'The Thing From Another World'. 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette 'Who Goes There?') and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with 'E.T.' and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!",10,174,217,6 December 2003
Armageddon," I agree that this film is stupid but I was entertained
","After some silly opening narration by Charlton Heston the story starts. According to this an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in 13 days. If it hits it will destroy the entire planet. (I know I know--just go with it) So NASA (led by a slumming Bily Bob Thornton) hires a group of oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis), trains them how to work in outer space, sets them off to drill a hole in the asteroid, set explosives and get the hell out of there...all in 11 days. Also, before the asteroid hits, meteors are coming down and virtually wiping out major cities like New York and Shanghai.As you can see logic disappears pretty quick in this one. Director Michael Bay has said he makes movies for teenage boys. That's no surprise. There's LOTS of explosions here, lots of masculine men fighting each other and a plot dumbed down so anyone can understand it. There's also a hysterically funny 'love' story between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (their goodbye scene using Animal Crackers has become a classic of bad cinema). Despite all this the movie WAS a huge hit. I saw it in a theatre back in 1998. It was a ridiculously stupid movie but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. It pounds you into submission with some incredible widescreen imagery, LOUD stereo sound and some truly unbelievable special effects. After a while you ignore the stupid story and just sort of go with it. As for characterizations--well who needs that? All of the actors are playing walking, talking clichés. There's not one person that acts like a normal human being. Liv Tyler tries but the script is stacked against her. Also I LOVE how she's allowed to casually stroll around the top secret NASA facility while her father and boyfriend are on the mission! The acting is as good as it can be. Willis delivers his regular one note performance; Thornton doesn't take this seriously for a moment; Tyler tries; Affleck looks lost and Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Will Patton and Michael Clarke Duncan basically hit their marks and say their lines. So this movie is big, loud, stupid and far too long but it WAS entertaining. Just turn off your mind, sit back and watch things blow up. I give it a 7.",7,20,32,22 July 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," If you liked the original...
","This film very closely follows the plot of the original 'classic'. An all American family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere (New Mexico desert here) and are attacked by a family ravaged by nuclear radiation.I'm no fan of the first one. I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it's really happening can get to you. It didn't scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It's surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It's not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one. Otherwise--stay away. I give it a 5.",5,2,4,25 March 2006
American Psycho," Good acting, well-made but not GOOD
","For starters they took an unfilmable book, toned down all the gore (or removed it entirely) and tried to film it.  The book was bad to begin with...why try to film it?  The plot is thin and stretched out to 105 minutes and the point is made early on in the film...and then there's no where to go!  There was nothing well new or exciting in this film.  What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.  Hopefully, this will bring bigger and better things for Bale.",7,4,10,24 April 2000
North by Northwest," Easily Hitchcock's best
","Businessman Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistakenly thought to be a Federal agent. He is kidnapped by an evil man (James Mason). They soon realize they've captured the wrong man and try to have him killed. But it doesn't work and Thornhill finds himself a hunted man...OK--this is not perfect. There's some lousy back projection (but all Hitchcock films have that) and I was never really sure WHAT the bad guys were doing (something to do with microfilm). Also I've never believed Grant's actions when someone is killed in front of him (WHY did he grab the knife?). But the film is so incredibly entertaining no one has ever cared. This has some of Hitchcock's most famous scenes--the infamous 'crop dusting' sequence and the climax on top of Mount Rushmore--but the whole film is just as good. There's a tense auction sequence and Grant's harrowing car ride down a treacherous road while dead drunk.There are some amusing parts in the film: Grant's mother appears to be a few years YOUNGER than him; the main villains last name is Vandamm; the romantic sparring between Grant and Eva Marie Saint is full of sexual innuendo; Martin Landau (one of Vandamm's henchman) is gay (he says he has a woman's intuition and has slightly exaggerated mannerisms--but it's not offensively done) and get a load of Vandamms mountain house at the end! Grant appears a bit old for this but he pulls it off; Eva Marie Saint is incredibly beautiful and pretty good as the love interest (sort of); Martin Landau is so young and handsome with blazing blue eyes and James Mason is just perfect as the evil Vandamm--his lines seem to come so effortlessly and he's so suave...but you also see the cruelty hiding underneath. Probably one of the best Hitchcock villains ever.So--excellent script with incredible dialogue; rich, bright Technicolor; shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process); great score and Hitchcock's always great direction with several astounding camera shots. Never boring--even at 136 minutes. A true classic. Don't miss this one! I give it a 10.'That's funny. That plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.'",10,4,8,2 April 2005
Hugo," Looks great but that's it
","Story that takes place in the 1920s. An orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) lives in a huge Paris terminal making sure all the clocks run correctly. He gets involved in a mystery involving his dead father (Jude Law), a mechanical figure and the mysterious Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).The first film directed by Martin Scorsese for a family audience. Too bad it's so terrible. It's boring (I considered leaving a few times), heavy handed, simplistic and slow. The plot is virtually nonexistent and the coincidences that occurred were WAY too hard to believe. Plenty of plot loopholes too. To make matters worse we have a station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who (I suppose) is supposed to be funny but just comes across as annoying. On the plus side it LOOKED great (the station and overviews of Paris in the 1930s are astonishing) and this movies uses 3D better than any other movie I've seen. It also has a message that books are great and movies are magic--two VERY positive messages for any child to hear. An extra bonus is seeing the actual films of Georges Melies on a big screen in great condition with the hand colored frames of the originals. The acting was OK and it was a treat to see Christopher Lee in a small role. But, all in all, I found this pointless and boring. It's only being praised to the high heavens because Scorsese did it. A 1 all the way.",1,76,154,21 January 2012
The Shining," It's a horror of a film!
","Lousy adaptation of Stephen King's great novel. It's about a family watching over a huge hotel (the Overlook) which is located in the mountains in Colorado during the winter. They're basically isolated out there--miles and miles away from anyone. Also seems the hotel is haunted and starts to take possession of the father (Jack Nicholson). Then the snowstorms hit--they're completely snowed in and the mother (Shelley Duvall) and little son (Danny Lloyd) are at the mercy of the axe-wielding father...The novel was VERY scary and well-done--Kubrick single-handedly trashes the entire book. Kubrick WAS a great director but he just didn't know how to do a straight-forward horror film. He acts like this is an important film--he takes it WAY too seriously. He makes very ill-conceived changes from the book (one character is brutally killed, but he was alive and well at the end of the book, and where are the hedge animals?) and has Nicholson's character act so weird from the get go that we don't really notice any change when he goes crazy. Nicholson IS good however but Duvall is annoying and Lloyd was basically not accomplished enough to pull off his role (but he WAS a young kid). Scatman Crothers is good but he's not in the film enough to really help. Also the film isn't scary ONCE. Kubrick shows all his purported 'shocking' moments with loud, annoying music--problem is nothing he shows us is scary. Also the ending is REALLY stupid and throws in a reincarnation angle that comes out of NOWHERE (and isn't in the book).My main issues with this is that it isn't scary, is WAY too long and way too serious. Even King himself hated this. But there are some people who think everything Kubrick did was fantastic and even defend this. I hated it in 1980...I still hate it now. I give it a 1.",1,12,37,17 September 2004
American Beauty," The more I see it the more I hate it
","Technically, this movie doesn't exactly break new ground--it portrays the dark side of suburbia--that's been done in the '60s (No Down Payment), 70s (Stepford Wives) and 80s (Blue Velvet). This movie does the same thing but got a lot of praise--WAY too much.Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey are good. Bening basically plays a cold, materialistic 'witch' who cares about money and furnishings more than anything else. She's never played a character like this and she's just great. Spacey plays a man who we see, in the course of the film, imploding. He feels trapped and disgusted with his job and life and goes to extremes to escape his situation.SPOILERS!!! So he rebels against conforming and drives his wife (who wants to conform)and daughter crazy. Then there's a turn around with his character at the end that I didn't believe for one second. He realizes that he does love his wife and daughter and decides to make them happy. Then he's killed. So--the message here is to conform or you'll be killed. That message is pretty scary and negative. And he's killed by a closeted gay guy whose advances he rejected. That's more than a little homophobic. SPOILER END!The acting is good and the film LOOKS great--there are some beautiful shots here--but it's message is horrible, negative and more than a little scary. It's now considered one of the worst pictures ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. I agree!",1,5,12,21 October 1999
Duck Soup," Next to 'A Night at the Opera' this is the Marx Bros. best movie
","Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) becomes leader of tiny Freedonia on the insistence of rich Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). For no good reason he starts war on the neighboring Sylvania. Chico and Harpo play spies and Zeppo (in his last movie) plays Firefly's secretary.This was a financial flop when it came out. Why it bombed has never been known, but this was a political satire and the country was still dealing with the Great Depression. Also there was a war raging in Europe. People went to movies to escape and this probably would have reminded them of what was going on. It wasn't until the 1960s that this was rediscovered and rightfully became a comedy classic.This is virtually non stop jokes and slapstick. There are no silly romantic songs or subplot to slow the movie down and (thankfully) Chico and Harpo don't have their harp or piano solos. There are many classic scenes including the mirror bit. My favorite is the last sequence when the war is raging and the Brothers clothes keep changing (on purpose) from shot to shot.A comedy classic. I like 'Night at the Opera' just a LITTLE bit more though. A 10 all the way.",10,1,3,14 August 2006
Van Helsing," Not the disaster I heard it was--but not good at all
","In the 18th century, Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is working for the church (???) travels to Romania with a monk Carl (David Wenham) to battle Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), his three brides, the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) and the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley). He's helped by feisty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).This has been trashed by critics everywhere. No it isn't good at all...but I've seen worse. It starts off great with a black & white prologue dealing with Dr. Frankenstein creating the Monster for Dracula. The doctor is killed and so is his creation (supposedly). Then it cuts to a year later with Van Helsing being sent to battle Dracula and his three wives who are attacking a nearby village for blood. There he finds a werewolf roaming about also and the Monster is alive. But Dracula wants the monster to....FORGET IT! The plot just gets more vague and sillier as it goes on. Anyways plot is not the reason this movie exists--it's done to push CGI down our throats.There's LOTS of action in this film, incredible special effects (all are CGI) and tons of explosions and such---but I was bored. The plot is WAY too vague and the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book. There's no characterizations or depth to ANY of the characters--how was I supposed to care for these people when I didn't know who they were? Also this film has way too much going on it in--the opening has Van Helsing killing Mr. Hyde (and Dr. Jekyll too)! And pitting him against THREE monsters was just overkill. Jackman was very good (considering he had nothing to do). Beckinsale was terrible but it's not her fault. Wenham unfortunately plays the 'comic' relief (and is hating every second of it). Kemp has little screen time but he is good (and VERY handsome). Hensley is good as Frankenstein's monster. The makeup on the vampires and werewolves was VERY impressive too. And there was a great fight between two monsters at the end. But it's all money and CGI and no plot or characters. It's also frustrating that the violence was really toned down for the PG-13--there's next to no blood or gore in this film. And it's TOO LONG--an elaborate masquerade party could have been left out completely (and is a total ripoff of Roman Polanski's 'The Fearless Vampire Killers'). This was a bomb at the box office so we're (thankfully) not going to get any sequels. I can't recommend it--but kids will like it.",6,4,11,21 May 2004
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," VERY uneasy mix of horror, humor and drama
","Siblings Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are witch hunters. They're hired by the mayor of a local town where 12 children have been abducted by witches. It seems an evil powerful witch (Famke Jenssen) has them and is setting up some big ritual that will make her more powerful than any other witch.The story is kind of vague but this was obviously heavily cut before it was released. There are plot loopholes galore and a creature named Edward appears out of nowhere and is never explained. And Hansel is (for no discernible reason) a diabetic! The horror, humor and drama never mesh together comfortably. Still this isn't a disaster. There's plenty of exciting fights and plenty of way over the top gore--but it's too silly to take seriously. There's also excellent special effects and a great score. Renner is just OK as Hansel but Arterton is excellent as Gretel. Jenssen is pretty bad--she's admitted she did it for the money--and it shows. It's not the disaster I heard it was but it's no great shakes either. I give it a 6.",6,1,3,4 February 2013
Dreamgirls," What a dream!
","A musical based (very loosely) on Diana Ross and the Supremes. It starts in Detroit in the early 60s when a black, all-girl trio sing at amateur night. They're called the Dreamettes (Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce Knowles and Anika Noni Rose). A sleazy manager (Jamie Foxx) hires them as backup singers for James early (Eddie Murphy). Eventually they get their chance at stardom but Hudson is told that Knowles will be the lead singer...and the band falls apart.The melodramatics are totally predictable and there's some so-so acting (Murphy and Foxx walk through their roles) but the three leading ladies keep this on track and the musical numbers crackle with energy and fire. All three can sing beautifully and dance too. When they're on stage the movie leaps to life. Even if the songs are just OK their performances lift them up. After the show-stopping 'I Tell You I'm Not Going' belted out by Hudson the film does sort of meander and get oh so predictable but I still loved this.As I said the acting is OK by the guys--the ladies hold this together. Rose doesn't have much to do but she's full of life and energy; Knowles can really belt out the songs and is a VERY good actress but this is Hudson's movie--and she knows it. She's just a mountain of strength and her voice is just beyond belief. She DOES stop the movie with 'I Tell You...' My silent audience applauded out loud when she finished. Whenever she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her.I have only one real complaint--the musical numbers are shot with that annoying MTV style--cutting to a different angle endless times during the performances. There's some nice choreography going on during the numbers--when you can see it. All they should have done was plant the camera and let the ladies and their magic carry the numbers through. Still I can live with that.I give it a 9 only because of the editing and the predictable melodrama--but I still recommend this. A really good musical.",9,4,11,31 December 2006
Spider-Man," Good...except for Maguire
","You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis.The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film:1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second.2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic.However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV). Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire.",8,3,6,13 May 2002
Dark City," Excellent sci-fi
","I hate sci-fi, but I LOVE this movie. Well acted (especially by Sutherland and Sewell), astounding set design, moody direction and cinematography and a plot with numerous twists and turns. I'm not even going to try to explain the plot--it's way too involved. Also, this is an adult movie and demands your full attention--it would either disturb or bore children. It should be seen also for two performances--Jennifer Connolly who is drop-dead gorgeous and Rufus Sewell who is absolutely one of the most beautiful men I have ever seen--and those brown eyes of his! A must-see movie--even if you don't like sci-fi. Try to see it on DVD--this movie needs to be letter-boxed to fully appreciate it.",10,1,6,15 November 2000
Dunkirk," Visually exciting but emotionally distant.
",Based on fact movie but the war at Dunkirk. British and French soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk waiting to take a ship back to England. However the Germans are doing a non-stop bombing of Dunkirk beach (where the soldiers are) and the ships coming to save them.Visually this is an impressive movie. The visuals are stunning (especially in IMAX) and the battle sequences are beautifully shot. However there's no emotional involvement with the main characters. You know their names--and that's about it. It's really hard to give a damn if you know nothing about them. I suppose the acting was good but--since they're given nothing to work with--I really couldn't tell.So visually it's impressive but emotionally cold. Try to see it in IMAX.,9,2,8,10 August 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Boring and badly acted
","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a radioactive spider and has the powers of a spider and fights crime as Spider-Man. He also falls in love with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) whose father (Denis Leary) just happens to be the chief of police and hates Spider-Man. Then there's doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) develops a serum that he hopes will cure people of any ailment. He tries it on himself and becomes the Lizard who wants to wipe out the human race.OK--I never liked the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies. I thought he didn't look (or act) like Peter Parker and was WAY too low-key as an actor. Garfield looks like Parker--but his acting is terrible. He's all over the place and never seems to get a grip on his character's pain and anxiety. Also the film is slow-paced and--frankly--just boring. I kept looking at my watch! On the up side the acting (Grafield aside) was excellent. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Stone was sweet, innocent AND sexy as Gwen Stacy. Leary was good as Captain Stacy. It was also great to see Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz briefly as Peter's parents. The CGI and special effects were flawless--but we've seen this all before. There's no sense of wonder and amazement at what Spider-Man can do. We KNOW it's done by computers and that robs it of any sense of magic it might have. Boring and badly done. I give it a 2.",2,11,32,19 July 2012
54," Pretty pathetic
","Dull, boring story about the legendary Studio 54 and one of its owners, Steve Rubell (played by Mike Meyers).  It also deals with three other people played by Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer.  What their names were, I don't remember...mostly because there's absolutely nothing going on here.Purportedly, the original version was much stronger--so strong with sex and drug use that it was threatened with an NC-17.  Then test audiences reacted VERY negatively to the extreme stuff (a gay kiss was completely cut out). What came out was a seriously watered down version of what might have been a good movie.  I HATE those stupid test audiences!!  I was actually in Studio 54 back in 1980--what I saw there was in NO way portrayed in the movie.  The drug use was out in the open and there were people (literally) having sex--gay and straight!  That's not shown here in any way.Phillippe (as the lead) was terrible.  He is handsome and muscular but has a blank face on all the time.  Hayek is good but given nothing to do.  Ditto with Meyer (who's VERY good).  Neve Campbell barely even registered.  Myers is (surprisingly) very good in a dramatic role.  The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for him.  Also there are a few good songs (especially 'If You Could Read My Mind').But, basically, this movie is so light and inconseqential that I forgot about it the next day!  A waste.  See the E True Hollywood Story on this--that gives a much more accurate portrayal of the club itself.",1,1,5,25 November 2003
The Fast and the Furious," First drive-in movie of the millenium
","Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the 'hijacking' sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women.",6,73,147,28 April 2003
The Exorcist," Still scary and shocking
","Angelic little 12 year old Regan (Linda Blair) is possessed by the devil. Her mother (Ellen Burnstyn) tries every medical cure to no avail. She finally tries exorcism with Father Merrian (Max von Sydow) and a priest (Jason Miller) performing it. This film was considered the most horrifying film ever made back in 1973. It's still horrifying to this very day. Blair screaming out obscenities, finding new uses for a crucifix and doing projectile vomiting are still hard to watch--this film is NOT for children! I saw the new version this weekend. With the addition of the now infamous 'spider walk' and another doctor visit, the footage added nothing new to the film. In fact, it made the film a bit too long. It does have great acting, especially from Blair, Burnstyn and von Sydow. Also the special effects still hold up today. Well worth seeing. A very scary, graphic horror film.",10,3,6,25 September 2000
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Next to 'The Avengers' (2012) this is the best superhero film ever!
","This takes place in the future. All mutants have been enslaved along with humans who tried to help them. Only a small team of the X-Men remain. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) have an idea to send Wolverine (High Jackman) back into the 1970s to stop a killing from happening and change the future. They send him back but can he change things in time? Next to 'The Final Stand' this is easily the best X-Men movie ever. I wasn't going to see it because I hated 'X-Men: First Class' but (technically) this isn't a sequel to that. It ties into that movie but also works with the first three movies. There are plenty of action sequences that are exciting with flawless special effects. It's sometimes however a little TOO violent--one character gets beheaded and another is torn apart. That's going a little too far. Also we're introduced early to a bunch of the X-Men who I didn't recognize...and their names (or powers) are never explained. This was a problem in a few of the earlier movies too. And James McAvoy was back as a young Professor X...and is terrible. All that aside however I loved this. The acting was good and there are many cameos from previous X-Men (it was great seeing Storm and Colossus again). Stewart, McKellan and Jackman easily hold the film together with their wonderful acting and Michael Fassbender is clearly enjoying himself as Megento. So a great film--well worth seeing.",9,2,7,27 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Superb Avengers film
","The Avengers are in trouble. Because quite a few innocent people were accidentally killed during their many battles the government wants to rein them in. They draft a bill that makes it clear that the Avengers only go into battle when the government allows them too. Iron Man, Black Widow and a few others sign it. Captain America, Falcon and others won't. This leads to an all out battle.Just GREAT movie--overflowing with good acting and wonderful action scenes. It moves quickly--the 147 minutes flew by. This did everything right that 'Batman vs. Superman' did so badly. It's serious but also has a sharp sense of humor and some VERY funny lines from Spiderman. Only two debits--Sebastian Stan is bad as Bucky and the way Scarlet Witch was treated at the end was vicious beyond belief. Still this is a wonderful comic book film well worth your time.",10,2,7,21 May 2016
American History X," Excellent but curiously unmoving
","A white supremacist Derek (Edward Norton) is sent to jail for brutally killing two black men who try to steal his car.  Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?First off I'm giving the film an 8.  I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly.  Those issues aside the film is great.The script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here.  Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend.  The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.Some of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way.  This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly.  As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all.  Still, it is a powerful film.  Well worth catching.Also there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released.  It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak).  He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  He didn't win his request.  If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job.  The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences.",8,6,11,17 May 2003
Saw III," Who would have thought? A GOOD second sequel!
","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back but, at this point, he is slowly dying. He's in a secret hiding place aided by his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Amanda kidnaps a brilliant doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to keep him alive so he can play one more game with a man (Angus Macfayden) who is seeking vengeance for his dead son. But there's more here than meets the eye.Like the first two this is grim, brutal and VERY bloody including a graphic brain surgery sequence that almost made me bolt from the theatre. Again it questions Jigsaw's right to kill people who don't respect their lives...or others. But it also ties up some loose ends left in 'Saw 1' and '2'. It especially gives more information on Amanda and who she is and why she helps Jigsaw. It also provides a solid ending for part 2. I don't think there's ever been a case when two sequels to a movie are just as good as the original! The 'Godfather' movies didn't do it and neither did 'Scream'. This may be the first time ever.The acting is just great. Bell (as always) is good and Smith is just incredible--she comes barreling off the screen and takes no prisoners. Her character goes through some incredible changes and Smith pulls them off. Macfayden is also good but given little to do (I was amused when his accent slipped a few times) and the same with Soomekh.Like the first two this left me shaken--it really grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. If you haven't seen the first two don't bother with this--you won't be able to follow it. Also avoid if graphic blood and gore bother you. Naturally most of the critics have been trashing this--dismissing it as sadistic and pointless. There are a few out there though who can see it's not just another sick horror film--it has a plot and a point. The graphic violence is necessary for the integrity of the picture. Very disturbing but fascinating too. An 8 all the way--I can't give it a 10 because I can't say I enjoyed the film.",8,1,5,5 November 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Fluffy but lots of fun
","A rarity--a remake that's better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it's light; yes, it's a trifle but it's so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.",10,73,89,10 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Too long, too depressing
","A movie about the events leading to Pearl Harbor and the aftermath up to when America bombed Tokyo. The movie looks beautiful--some of the shots literally took my breath away. The special effects are very realistic. The film deals with an actual event but the three main characters are fictional and the action scenes are exciting if a little bit too fast and furious (I almost wish I had brought some Dramamine with me). A rousing music score is great too. All the acting is good too (especially Ben Affleck and Kate Breckinsale--Josh Hartnett is OK). Also there's strong supporting roles done by Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight (as President Roosevelt!) and Dan Aykroyd (very good in a straight dramatic role).But I don't like the movie. It's way too long (3 hours--this easily could have been done in 2 1/2 or even 2 hours); the script is chock-full of every war movie cliché you can think of (right down to all the Japanese being evil and cold-blooded) and the direction--Michael Bay is very good at action--he is horrendous at romance. The love scenes between Kate Brekinsale and Ben Affleck have some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life--the actors deserve credit for keeping a straight face while mouthing those lines. Also you do not film a love scene with the camera jammed in the actors faces. We know Affleck and Brekinsale are both beautiful--we don't need constant close-ups to prove it. Also, there are reports that Michael Bay was uncomfortable directing the women in the film...it shows. Beckinsale and the other women in the cast are good, but they seem to be unsure of how to play scenes. I don't blame them--I blame the director. Also, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s part is little more than a glorified cameo. What is he doing in this? His total screen time amounts to (maybe) 15 minutes!The destruction of Pearl Harbor is unbelievable. It's also very grim and looks way too realistic. It's 40 minutes of ships blowing up, men (and women) getting gunned down in cold blood or drowning to death. It's not entertaining--it's depressing. I've also heard that this movie is chockful of incredibly stupid historical inaccuracies.Also, I saw it at a preview audience--people were hissing the film at the end. What does that tell you? Bad dialogue, historically inaccurate, full of clichés and a far too graphic rendering of the bombing. I can't recommend this film.",2,4,12,24 May 2001
The Conjuring 2," Way too slow
","This takes place in 1978 and is based on a true story. Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) fight a ghost in England that targets a family with a divorced mom and four children. It targets especially their 11 year old girl.The first movie was a good scary movie. It had its faults but it worked. This one doesn't. For starters it's too long. There's no reason for this film to run almost 2 and half hours. Plenty of sequences could have been trimmed or cut out completely. Secondly it has too many damn jump scares. They're annoying and force the audience to jump. Also it's VERY slow-moving. I got bored pretty quickly. Worst of all it just isn't scary. The attack scenes weren't even remotely scary. On the plus side it is well-acted and directed with accurate 1978 clothes and fads portrayed. Also the ending is great--violent and exciting but its too little too late. This has been getting raves from critics and viewers so I'm definitely in the minority here but I really didn't like it.",4,2,8,15 June 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," I'm not quite sure what to make of it but I had fun!
","Slacker Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winsted). However, to get her, he must battle and defeat her 7 exes.I expected the worst when I saw how this was advertised (An Epic of Epic Epicness) but I had a free pass so I thought 'What the hell?' I was surprised (actually kind of shocked) to find myself enjoying it. I'm not the target audience for this (I'm in my 40s and most of the kids in the theatre were in their 20s) but I still enjoyed myself. It's bursting with ideas, jokes, action...you name it. There are constant times that little words or phases pop up on the screen to tell us things...but they'll all funny and had me laughing. For example: at one point somebody says 'You don't think I know what that means?' and the words 'He doesn't' appear next to him. Also there are plenty of fight sequences but they're non-bloody and go so far over the top that you can't take them seriously. Also when people are killed they dissolve into coins! I know that's obviously pointing towards video games--in fact a LOT of this plays like a video game! When Cera kills somebody points appear on the screen and when he goes off to face the final and 7th ex 'Level 7' pops up. Also Cera has a gay roommate (played to the hilt by Kieran Culkin) who is shown in a positive way and even has a fairly hot guy on guy kiss. He also sleeps in the same bed as Cera and WITH his boyfriend.The acting is good across the board. I never really liked Cera but he's perfectly cast here. Winsted is charming as Flowers. All her exes are well acted but my favorite had to be Brandon (Superman) Routh with blond hair as a mighty vegan. So I'm not quite sure what the point is here (if in fact there IS one) but I was never bored and found myself laughing quite a bit. I give it a 9.",9,10,35,4 August 2010
Enchanted," Didn't really work for me
","The first 20 minutes or so of this are fantastic. It's a cartoon where Gisella meets handsome Prince Edward and wants to marry him. However, his evil mother Queen Narissa doesn't want her to become queen. So she sends Gisella to the real world (New York City). She is followed by Prince Edward, a spy named Nathaniel and Pip--a chipmunk. Will Edward find Gisella there? The idea is a good one and this has a lot of things going for it: the opening cartoon is wonderful--it's like a whole Disney film running at top speeds and going WAY over the top in an amusing way. Amy Adams is just wonderful as Gisella. She doesn't overplay her character's naivety too much and avoids becoming too goody-goody. Also Pip is a CGI animated chipmunk here and he's just hysterical. His facial expressions and body movements had me laughing. Also the movie looks great--tons of bright color and great special effects. But that's it for the good things.The bad: James Marsden overplays Prince Edward to a degree that it becomes annoying. Susan Saradon is badly underused as Queen Narissa (her role is little more than a glorified cameo). Patrick Dempsey looks miserable (and acts it). But, most of all, the story has leaps of logic that are just impossible to ignore. There are so many of them that I don't have enough space to list them. A few: how does Gisella get on a subway-with no money? Why is Nathaniel in a kitchen to contact Narissa? Where does he get the various costumes and disguises he wears? How does Gisella get back into Robert's apartment after she left? That's just a few of the problems.So I really wanted to like this but the story inconsistencies kept annoying me. I might be being too cynical about this so use your own judgment. Kids will probably love it but, be warned, there is a somewhat scary sequence at the end.",6,5,12,14 December 2007
Yesterday," Not great but pleasant
","Struggling musician Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) has been trying for 10 years to be successful with no luck. Only his manager (Lily James) believes in him. Then there's a worldwide blackout for 12 seconds. During it Jack is in a car accident. He survives but it seems nobody in this reality ever heard of the Beatles, Also none of their songs exist either. So Jack starts to put out their songs as his originals and becomes famous...but he feels guilty.Strange movie. It does manage to be both funny and dramatic. I was honestly never bored. Also Patel can sing and pulls off covers of the many Beatle songs pretty well. However this movie has issues too. Patel has a tendency to overact and James is downright atrocious. The supporting characters though are fun. Also the direction is all over the place throwing things at you out of left field. Still, I'm a Beatles fan so I'm cutting this some slack. I give it a so-so recommendation.",7,1,2,4 July 2019
Flashdance," The first MTV movie--not a good thing
","A lady welder (Jennifer Beals) dances at a local bar at night and dreams of becoming a professional dancer. She's also romanced by her boss (Michael Nouri) and coached by a retired dancer. She also has a bunch of fellow dancers at the bar and a cook who tells some of the stupidest, sexist and racist jokes I've ever heard--by the way, we're supposed to LIKE this character and find his appalling humor hysterically funny!A shallow story, bad acting, crappy dialogue, non-stop profanity sink this. But then again, it's not really a movie--it's a bunch of MTV videos slung together with only the faintest gleam of a plot.This was (somehow) a huge hit back in 1983--I didn't like it then and I still don't like it now. I'm giving it a 5 just for the music, the message of the movie (follow your dreams no matter what), the good direction by Adrian Lyne and Beals (she can't act at all, but I like her...and she's a hell of a lot better than Nouri).How did such a stupid, shallow, foul-mouthed movie become such a big hit?",4,3,10,8 April 2003
Resident Evil," Fun
","Director Paul Anderson has done two of my favorite films--'Mortal Kombat' (I know it's based on a video game but I liked it) and 'Event Horizon' (one of the most unsettling sci-fi/horror films ever). This movie (also based on a video game) isn't good as the other two. But for what it is, it's great.A virus is mistakenly (?) let loose in a huge underground city run by a corporation. It kills everyone there and a military squad is sent down to deactivate the central computer. But the computer is active, aware...and angry. Soon the squad is dealing with flesh-eating zombies, zombie dogs and a huge, scary, angry mutant.The plot is needlessly complex and convoluted and brings the movie to a screeching halt so characters can explain what's going on. Also this movie goes out of its way to show Milla Jovovich nude more than once. But still, I enjoyed this movie. The acting is OK except for Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez--they're both very attractive but are terrible actors--there blank faces and lousy dialogue readings got annoying. The male members of the cast were, on the other hand, very good. The special effects are stunning and the movie is very loud, very fast, very violent and FUN! The booming music score helps propel the movie along. Also it has more than its share of creepy moments (the voice of the computer spooked me for some reason--it's a little girls voice!). Blood, violence, noise--hey, what more could you ask for? Worth catching.",7,0,2,25 March 2002
Gone with the Wind," What more can be said?
","This takes place before, during and after the Civil War. Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) sees her family and country torn apart by the war. She's also inexplicably in love with weak-willed Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). However he marries sickingly sweet Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Scarlett pines after him but she then meets rough tough Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who wants her.It's kind of difficult to make any fair critical assessment of the this film. You either love it or hate it. I happen to think this is easily one of the best movies ever made. It does have some minor problems: Howard is way too old to play Ashley (even he said he was all wrong for the part); Scarlett's obsession with Ashley is never really explained; some of the treatment of blacks is pretty racist--especially in the character of Prissy (although Mammy seems more intelligent than anyone else in the film) and the chronology of the Civil War itself is highly suspect. Still all these problems are trivial because the rest of the picture is so great.It's beautifully shot in rich Technicolor; the score is just simply one of the best ever written; the direction is simply superb (hard to believe that three different directors worked on this); the attention to detail in this film is incredible and despite the almost 4 hour length you're never bored. The acting is great--Leigh (completely covering her accent)understandably won an Academy Award for this; Hattie McDaniel is a tower of strength as Mammy--she was the first black person to ever win an Academy Award; I always thought Gable was too old for his role but he really grows on you; de Havilland does wonders playing an impossibly sweet woman and everyone else is good--right down to the bit parts. Also this movie has some of the most quoted lines in history--'Frankly my dear I don't give a damn'; 'I've birthed lots and lots of babies'; 'With God as my witness I'll never be hungry again' and of course 'after all tomorrow is another day'.Don't let the 220 minute length deter you--this is a true classic. A 10 all the way.",10,3,7,19 February 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Not as bad as you might think...
",When this came out in 2003 it was doomed. Nobody could take the idea of Ashton Kutcher (known just for comedy) in a serious sci-fi movie. Predictably it bombed at the box office. That's too bad because this is actually a very intriguing (if disturbing) film.Evan (played as a 13 year old by John Patrick Amedon) does not have a happy childhood. His dad is in a mental institution; his mom has to work constantly to pay the bills and is never around; one of his best friends (Tommy) is a borderline psycho and Tommy's dad is a pedophile. Evan keeps having blackouts and keeps a journal from age 7 on to maybe help him. When he reaches college age (played by Kutcher) his life is a mess...but he finds he can go back in time (by reading his journals). He goes back and tries to change everything...but things get worse and worse. Soon he's spinning through alternate realities and losing his mind...The story itself is intriguing and it's pulled off beautifully. I'm not a science fiction fan but this movie pulled me right in. The direction really puts this across--all the different realities are shot in different film stocks so you can tell where you are and the film never stops moving. And it did make me think--would I change anything if I could back in time? The acting is (almost) uniformly great. Amy Smart plays Kayleigh--Evan's girlfriend (sometimes). She has to play different variations on her character. Not an easy task but she pulls it off. Also William Lee Scott (playing Tommy) has to do the same and also does well. As for Kutcher--he isn't terrible but he's really not up for the role. He was OK but he needs to be more than that to put this across completely. He doesn't destroy the movie--he just lessens the impact. And Amedon deserves credit for playing Evan at 13--very well done.This movie is disturbing. There are quite explicit dialogue about child abuse and Tommy's behavior as a child (brought on by his sick dad) is downright horrifying. This is NOT a movie for kids. It does have a happy ending--sort of. I'm giving this an 8--I might have given it a 10 with a better actor in the lead.Recommended--just with reservations about Kutcher.,8,4,9,9 October 2005
Mamma Mia!," Yeah it's silly but exhilarating!
","Musical adaptation of the hit play with Abba songs. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is going to marry handsome Sky (Dominic Cooper) on a Greek island. She lives there with her single mom Donna (Meryl Streep). Sophie wants to find her father to give her away at the wedding. She finds out her mom slept with three different men at the time she was conceived and any one of them can be her dad! They are Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard). She invites them all to her wedding WITHOUT telling her mom.The plot is, to be nice, simplistic and predictable (it's just like the play) but who cares? It's just an excuse to bring in a huge amount of Abba songs belted out full blast by the cast members. Now I LOVE Abba so this movie just had me from the beginning. It was beautifully shot in Greece--some of the scenery takes your breath away. With one exception everyone can sing and the songs are worked seamlessly into the story. All the numbers are good but three stand out for me: Streep letting lose with 'The Winner Takes It All' and 'Dancing Queen' (which is turned into a women empowerment song) and Christine Baranski singing 'Does Your Mother Know' to a beach full of young hunky guys. The dancing is energetic and all the extras are young and attractive (especially the men) and are just great. There's young hunky guys all over the movie. There are some confusing dance numbers (I'm STILL trying to figure out what all those guys are doing during 'Lay All Your Love On Me') but the energy they have pulls them through. The acting is as good as it can be. Really--this is no great acting challenge but everybody seems to realize this is a slight story and play along with it. A few minor quibbles--the dancing is cut into quick shots here and there. I call it MTV style editing. It's TOO quick! I wanted it to stay put so we can see the dancing. Cooper is handsome and engaging but the character of Sky is supposed to be tall and muscular. Cooper is neither--but he CAN sing. On the other hand Pierce Brosnan can't. Hs singing is terrible! When he started singing 'S.O.S.' my audience broke out laughing! It doesn't ruin the movie but it brings a lot of unintentional laughter.The stage show ends with the cast members coming out and doing two more songs for the audience. The movie ends with Streep, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters singing full blast. At my theatre TONS of paper came out flying from two large 'cannons' hidden on each side of the screen! The paper went swirling around all through the theatre and REALLY set the audience off! Then Streep asks the audience 'Do you want another one?' My audience roared 'Yes!' and 'Waterloo' came barreling out. I walked out of the theatre laughing and exhausted but full of energy! Even without all the confetti flying around it would have worked.Beautiful fun musical full of energy and color. If you hate Abba don't see it but Abba fans (like me) will LOVE it! A 10 all the way! ADDENDUM: I saw this THREE times at a theatre! I paid FULL PRICE each time!! That must tell you how much I love this.",10,3,9,27 July 2008
Tigerland," Very good
","War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971.  It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland--an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil, before they're shipped over.  It focuses on two men--Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis)...how they meet, become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a borderline psycho (Shea Wingham).A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher.  He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes.  It works very well--the film looks gritty (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic.Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent.  His performance is just superb--he's an extremely talented young man.  Davis, unfortunately, is not that good.  He's tall, muscular, very handsome--and very bland.  The rest of the cast however is just great.This film was thrown away by its studio.  It had no stars in it, a familar story and was considered 'just another war film'.  It only played a week in Boston!  It's well worth catching on video or DVD.Also, Farrell and Davis have a lengthy nude scene.",8,32,46,2 December 2002
Batman Begins," What's all the fuss? It's just OK
","Batman redone. It gives us a new origin of Batman (Christian Bale) and how he got his powers and such. He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman. His first two villains are the Scarecrow (Cillain Murphy) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul--who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses.OK--it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed. I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up! It does have good parts--Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman. He also pumped up for the role (we have at least two shirtless scenes). It LOOKS great (if very dark) and it has elaborate special effects left and right (with tons of explosions thrown in too). But I was mostly bored. The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly--it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans. Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere. At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines. This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an 'atmosphere' to the scene. Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job (i.e. entertaining you). However Batman's costume, the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically.Acting varies--Bale was just great. Michael Caine (as Alfred) matched him. Even Katie Holmes (a limited actress) was good--too bad she won't be in the sequel (this inexplicable romance/marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career). Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher--he appeared to be drugged out. Gary Olman was (suprisingly) terrible as Jim Gordon--he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role. But Rutger Hauer, Linus Roache (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale) and Morgan Freeman were all great.To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once. I couldn't wait for this thing to get over. All the praise this is getting is beyond me. I give it a 7--and that's mostly for the acting.",7,18,31,4 July 2005
Twilight," Not as bad as I've heard
","**REAL minor spoilers* Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) moves to Washington state to live with her father Charlie (Billy Burke)--her parents are divorced. While attending high school there she become attracted to light-skinned Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He is attracted to her also--but he turns out to be a vampire! I heard lots of negative things about this (that it didn't match the novel and looked cheap). While it's no masterpiece it's not that bad at all. It has a good score (especially when Bella discovers Edward is a vampire) and has beautiful locations. The sometimes clunky dialogue from the novel has been replaced (or written out completely) and the story moves very quick (the novel is over 500 pages). There's also excellent makeup and special effects used sparingly (which makes them all that more effective). Also the evil James is well played by Cam Gigandet and the final battle is actually pretty frightening. In terms of acting almost everyone is good--especially Pattinson who is just great. On the bad side--the movie seems somewhat muted (for some reason). Stewart is just OK (but she DID turn 18 while the movie was being filmed so that might have affected her acting). Also Burke is terrible as her father and it had a stupid 'it isn't over' ending which wasn't in the book! Still, this was well-made and done and worth catching. I give it a 7.",7,4,10,6 December 2008
Meet the Fockers," Mild OK comedy
","I should point that I never saw the original 'Meet the Parents' so I went into this with no preconceived ideas. Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) is going to marry Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). Only problem is her father Jack (Robert De Niro) doesn't really like him but her mom Dina (Blythe Danner) does. They all go to meet Gaylord's parents--Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Razalin (Barbra Streisand). His parents are liberal and free-wheeling--hers aren't. Sparks fly.The only reason I saw this was for the cast. We have some wonderful actors here--De Niro, Hoffman, Danner and Streisand. They all can do comedy and make the movie pleasant. All in all it's very OK. It moves quick, the comedy isn't too crude (hence the PG-13 rating) and Stiller and Polo make a nice pleasant couple. My only problems are Stiller's character going through some needlessly violent slapstick, De Niro's character is WAY too unpleasant (especially at the end) and the beautiful Danner is criminally underused. Still it works as a nice mild comedy.",6,0,0,4 August 2013
Before Sunset," Just great
","A sequel to the 1995 film 'Before Sunrise'. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended.",10,139,179,16 July 2004
Man on the Moon," Good for Kaufman fans
","If you're an Andy Kaufman fan, you'll love this movie. Jim Carrey looks, sounds like, acts like Kaufman. It's an incredible performance. But if you're not a Kaufman fan (like me), stay away. This movie offers no insight to who Andy Kaufman was or why he acted the way he did. It brings up the question--why did they bother making the movie? Movie biographies are usually made to show us who someone was and why they acted in a certain way. This one just turns out to be Carrey aping Kaufman and giving us a 'greatest hits' of Kaufman's career. It's all well-done and acted, but what was the point? It's no surprise that this is failing at the box office.",5,0,0,31 January 2000
1941," No masterpiece, but funny and very interesting
","Very loud, very big and very funny fictional account of a supposed Japanese invasion of Los Angeles in 1941, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  There are many plotlines throughout the film--too many to summarize here. Basically, this is the most unusual Spielberg film I've ever seen (and his only bomb).  It's from the bigger is funnier school of humor--Spielberg's only big comedy.  There's lots of gunfire, lots of fights, lots of screaming (in full stereo) and tons of destruction (an entire amusement park is destroyed, a few city blocks of Los Angeles and a big beautiful house).  As for the acting--it varies wildly.  Tim Matheson plays a lt. who has the hots for Nancy Allen who only gets excited in moving planes--they're both cute and funny.  Dan Aykroyd is wasted.  John Belushi is annoying.  Robert Stack is amusing.  Ned Beatty and Lorraine Gary are funny, but underused.  Treat Williams is violent and very unfunny.  And where else can you see Christopher Lee play a German?  The film is too long (I saw the 2 1/2 director's cut) and it doesn't always work...but when it does, it's hilarious!  A definite highlight is the jitterbug sequence--unfortunately, it has a violent conclusion in which a very likable character is punched out three times.  Terrific John Williams score too.  The ending credits are quite interesting--it shows each cast character screaming!  You may hate this film, but it's definetely a one of a kind.  It's a cult classic in Europe.",7,2,7,26 December 2000
Revolutionary Road," Dark and unsettling but fascinating
","This takes place in the mid-1950s in Connecticut. There's a young couple named Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). They have a big beautiful house in the suburbs and two kids...but they're miserable. Frank hates his job and April's dreams of becoming an actress are shattered. Things slowly get darker and more serious and leads to a disturbing ending.This is NOT a feel-good film. It's dark and unpleasant but it is an incredible look at the dark side of the picture perfect American suburb of the 1950s. The cars, clothes, furnishings and music are right on target. The acting by the leads is incredible. DiCaprio explodes in his role. He's miserable and slowly gets angrier. He's downright terrifying! Winslet had the much more difficult role of his wife but she's brilliant. You see her crumbling inside and trying to hold herself together. Just incredible. Everybody is good but a little extra credit goes to Michael Shannon playing the dangerously crazy John. There is some humor though. I got a big kick out of one woman who smokes constantly in the movie even when she's pregnant!There are a few missteps. This does have its slow parts and the kids the couple have seem to disappear completely for long periods of time. You would think they would play a part in their parents lives but that never seems the case. Still this is a fascinating if depressing look at suburban life in the 1950s. Obviously not for everybody. I give it a 9.",9,0,1,10 January 2010
28 Days Later...," Disturbing
","A man named Mark wakes up in a deserted hospital in London. He wanders outside finding no sign of people at all. It seems a plague (transmitted by blood) has turned most of the population into flesh-eating, fast moving zombies. Mark finds a few more uninfected people and they struggle to survive.I expected a gore fest on the order of 'Night of the Living Dead' or 'Dawn of the Dead'. That's not what I got. There is some extreme violence (including a little bit at the end that I'm surprised got by with an R rating) but not a lot and it comes in short bursts. This story concentrates on the characters and their moods and actions. And, for once, they act just like you would expect people to act in such a situation. Also attention is paid to such things as electricity, water supply, food etc etc which other movies like this totally ignore. But it is depressing and, at the end, extremely disturbing. This isn't a movie you really enjoy...you just appreciate it for how well it's done. Also it was shot in muted color on video which just adds to the feeling of helplessness. It does have some very scary scenes...these zombies move VERY quickly (they're shot in fast motion), the attack scenes have blood gushing out and there's an extremely eerie sequence inside a tunnel. Also the acting is uniformly good especially by Cillian Murphy (who also has a very lengthy nude scene at the beginning) and Naomie Harris as strong, tough Selena. Like director Danny Boyle's other films (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary) I like this with reservations. I'm recommending it but only for those with strong stomaches.",8,12,21,28 June 2003
It Follows," OK but overpraised
","Indie horror film that's actually playing at mainstream cinemas. It's about a teenage girl who has sex with a guy she just met. Then he tells her she's marked for death. She'll see people walking to her and, if they get her, will kill her. The catch is no one else can see them--only her. The only way to get rid of this is to have sex with someone else and it will pass on to them.The premise is certainly original and the film is well-done but some critics are acting like this is a masterpiece. It's good but not THAT good. It's was shot on location in Detroit and took advantage of the run-down part of the city. Everything looks grimy and dingy perfectly setting the tone for the movie. Also there's an eerie and impressive music score that really helps. Also there's only one jump scare and not much blood or gore at all. There are also two sequences which scared me silly. The acting is, at best, OK. No one is terrible but no one is really good either.The main problem here is that the movie is too laid-back. These teenagers take everything way too casually--even when they start being attacked or are killed. It sort of mutes the movie. Still it works more often than it doesn't. I give it a 7.",7,2,18,8 April 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Too long but worthwhile
","The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy combine forces to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin). It seems he has a glove that needs five stones to give him power to control the galaxy. He has three on the and will do ANYTHING to get the last two.It's too long and has no ending but I still loved it! The CGI Is flawless, the action scenes are fast and furious and the story whizzes along. The movie does assume you've seen every Marvel comic book film to get the characters so be warned. The acting is great and the movie manages to juggle multiple characters and plots and still make sense. Can't wait for part 2! :)",9,6,12,27 April 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful cinematography, great fights--little else
","What's all the fuss about? This movie is a Japanese romantic drama about male and female roles and a special sword and tons of other stuff. The story is so convoluted, I can't really recount it all. Basically, the film has, as I said, incredible fight scenes and beautiful wide-screen cinematography, but little else. The story is confusing and boring and, with the sole exception of Michelle Yeoh, badly acted (even Chow Yun-Fat!). I gave up on the film about halfway through when they threw in a needlessly long flashback that's a Western!!!! It adds very little to the story. It seems to be there just to up the romance in the movie. Also with such bad acting, you could care less about the characters. Also, the fight scenes aren't that original...Jackie Chan has been doing them in his movies since the 1970s. Also, the film is subtitled...it doesn't bother me but other viewers might not like it. So an overpraised Japanese film. In a few years, nobody will remember this.",6,3,5,2 January 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Both fascinating and frustrating
","A faded actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) try to make it in 1969 Hollywood. Somehow Sharon Tate (Margot Robie) is mixed into all this. Charles Manson too.OK--in some ways this film is brilliant. Wonderful direction by Quentin Tarantino, great acting by the entire cast and 2/3rds of it is superb. However the first section is deadly dull with a LONG sequence showing DiCaprio acting in a 1969 TV western. I hate westerns and this did nothing to change my mind. It drones on endlessly and I was fighting to stay awake. After that it was fantastic. There's one sequence with Pitt at the Spahm Ranch which is downright chilling. It all ends with some VERY extreme blood and gore. Recommended with reservations.",9,4,7,1 September 2019
Behind The Candelabra," I liked it,
",Purportedly true story of the stormy 6 year relationship between Liberace (Michael Douglas ) and his much younger lover Scott Thorson (Matt Damon). OK--Douglas looks nothing like Liberace but sounds just like him and got the mannerisms down pat. Damon is far too old to be playing Thorson--Damon is in his 40s and looks it--Thorson was about 20 when he met Liberace. But if u can ignore those leaps of logic u might like this.Personally I don't like Liberace. It's not because he's gay (I am too) but he was WAY too flamboyant and ugly. He was a talented pianist though. Still I found the movie interesting. It shows a realistic gay relationship and doesn't shy back from sex and nudity. Also Douglas was great in the role. I've never thought Damon was a good actor and this movie doesn't change my mind. Still he has his moments and u gotta give him credit for wearing some VERY revealing outfits throughout the movie and doing a few nude scenes (back view only). Also in the movie very briefly are Rob Lowe (as a doctor) and Dan Aykroyd (as Liberace's lawyer) but they hardly matter. Scott Bakula and Debbie Reynolds pop up too both looking unrecognizable as a friend of Thorson's and Liberace's mother.,8,4,10,28 May 2013
Gone Girl," Very good and almost great
","One day Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home from running his bar to find what looks like a break-in in his house and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. Quickly the police start up a search for her asking people to help. Then we see flashbacks to how Nick and Amy met and how their marriage was slowly unraveling. Then people start suspecting Nick. Did he or didn't he? Very good movie. The story is interesting and always keeps you guessing. It's long (2 and 1/2 hours) and slow but I was never bored. The acting is great. Affleck and Pike are both incredible in their roles. There's strong support by Carrie Coon (as Margo, Nick's sister), Kim Dickens (as a police detective) and Tyler Perry (as a lawyer). The only acting debit is from Neil Patrick Harris who's terrible. The only problem is the ending. It's TERRIBLE! It doesn't really end--it just stops leaving plenty of unresolved questions and plot lines. That really hurts the film as a whole. Still I recommend it.BTW there is no full frontal shot of Affleck. He appears to be totally nude in one scene but nothing is shown. You get a brief side glimpse and that's it.",8,4,15,12 October 2014

It's a good thriller. The acting is good, the twist unexpected and there's some STRONG bloody violence at the end. However it moves slowly and there were a few plot loopholes that I could not ignore. So it's good but has been wildly overpraised. Recommended but don't watch it expecting a masterpiece.",6,1,2,23 September 2018

",Ryan Gosling stars as Driver. He's a Hollywood stunt driver by day and serves as a wheelman for criminals by night. He then meets Irene (Carey Mulligan) a beautiful mother whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is just getting out of jail. He falls for her and then trouble starts. Mixed up in this are two vicious criminals (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman) who aren't above killing to get what they want.Critics raved about this when it came out but it bombed at the box office. Why? It was pushed as an action picture which this isn't. There IS action and violence but not a lot. It's a fascinating character study of a man (Driver) who has his own code of rules and is a loner--and what happens when he falls in love. The movie is beautifully directed with stunning night time cinematography of Los Angeles. There's also a music score which fits the movie perfectly. It's a quiet slowly paced film but it has bursts of VERY graphic violence which are jarring (but necessary). The acting is great. Perlman and Brooks are chilling in their roles. Mulligan (a very talented actress) isn't in this much but she's right on target when she is. Best of all is Gosling. He's easily one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He has very little dialogue but he conveys everything through looks or body language. You can't take your eyes off him. I won't lie--the slow pace finally got to me by the end but I still HIGHLY recommend this film. Just fascinating.,9,0,4,31 March 2012
Insidious," Scary but bogs down at the end
","Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and wife Renai (Rose Byrne) are happily married and have three kids. Then, after moving into a new house, one of their kids Dalton (Ty Simkins) falls into a coma...for no reason at all. They take care of him at home but then scary things happen. Rose starts hearing noises and seeing strange people around the house. They figure the house is haunted and has affected their son. They move to a new house and quickly realize it's NOT the house that is haunted.Pretty good evil spirit story. I avoided this like the plague when it came out because of the PG-13 rating. ALL the PG-13 horror films I've seen (except for 'The Ring') have been boring and stupid. This was praised by critics so I decided to give it a try on DVD. It was much better than other PG-13 horror films. It IS well made and acted and there were some very scary moments...but it's far from perfect. For one thing after it's established the couple has three kids the other two seem to disappear completely when they move to a new house. Also it has those incredibly annoying jump scare moments. What's even MORE annoying is the writer and director said they tried to avoid using them! There's also at least three fairly long sequences with people wandering around in dark houses and places...and these scenes are deadly boring and bring the movie to a screeching halt. And I HATED the terrible 'it's not over' ending. Still it did scare me and the acting is good across the board especially by Lin Shaye. It's also nice to see Barbara Hershey in a small role. So--I give it a marginal recommendation.",6,3,6,19 August 2011
2012," Does the end of the world have to be so boring????
","According to ancient Mayans the world will end on December 21, 2012. Something about all the planets lined up causing the Earth to fall apart. Geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejofor) finds out and warns people in 2009. The government keeps it secret much to the disgust of the president (Danny Glover). Cut to 2012. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet), HER new bf and their two annoying kids try to evade being killed when California is destroyed. They find a possible solution and rush to safety with destruction close behind.OK--the special effects ARE incredible. Seeing the entire coast of California crumble and be swept away is (in a strange way) kind of fun. All the destruction scenes are unbelievable--but that's maybe 30 minutes out of a movie that runs 160 minutes!!!! The rest is just some very talented actors having to recite some of the WORST dialogue I've ever heard. They're all giving very good performances but no one could make such generic lines work. Dialogue aside the basic plot is silly. Come on--the entire world will just be destroyed in 2012??? Also Cusack and family are constantly making these impossible escapes from near death. This happens CONSTANTLY! Gets dull after the fourth time. Also there are countless subplots and characters that add nothing to the main story. I'm STILL trying to figure out what the hell George Segal was doing here! They're boring and just drag out the movie. At 160 minutes this is FAR too long. 30 minutes or more could have easily been cut out with no loss. To make matters worse the film is constantly make you cry. Likable characters get killed and the film pours on the sentiment. I cry easily and this film set me off more than once...but it's FORCING you to cry. I hate films that do that! A good film wouldn't pull stuff like that. You would cry because you understand the characters and situations. Here it's like writer/director Roland Emmerich is grabbing you by the neck and yelling at you to cry! To make matters worse Woody Harrelson has a small part as a conspiracy nut and overacts to a degree that is just embarrassing.So--the special effects are incredible but the boring characters, ridiculous story and length make this a real chore to sit through. But then what can I expect from the guy who gave us 'Independence Day'? I give this a 1.",1,4,9,20 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Too many mutants!
","In this busy sequel from 'X2' Jean Grey (Famke Jansses) returns from the dead--but is becoming evil. Magneto (Ian McKellan) takes control of her. Also the government has found a cure for the mutant gene--Magneto and his brotherhood intend to destroy the cure while Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men want to protect it.There's a lot going for this movie. It's under 2 hours and moves very quickly--there's barely a letup. The special effects are just incredible and the battle sequences are fast and furious. Also stay through the closing credits--there's a nice bit right after it. There were also a few twists and turns I didn't see coming. The acting is MOSTLY good--McKellan is excellent as Magneto; likewise Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar is fine as Dr. Hank McCoy (Beast). But this movie has some problems too.The fast pace leaves no time for introductions or to really get to know the characters. Shawn Ashmore as Iceman is given little better to do than to look worried; Aaron Stanford scowls through his role as Pyro; Ben Foster as introduced as Angel--and given about two lines. Same with Collosus (Daniel Cudmore)--only a line or two. However there is a great sight gag when he casually walks down a hall with a huge TV under his arm. Anna Paquin and Ellen Page are given boring 1-dimensional roles. It's not the actors fault--they're given NOTHING to work with! They throw way too many mutants at us and then drop them. Also Patrick Stewart is TERRIBLE as Xavier. And I've had it with Halle Berry. She said after 'X2' that it was over for her. Then when her Oscar didn't help her career she comes back for 'X3'. She is NOT Storm--she's pretty bad too.The script is dumbed down too. The mutant cure would have been interesting to explore (but it isn't) and the Dark Phoenix storyline (lifted directly from the comics) is a lot LESS complex. The movie is just interested in throwing mutants and special effects at us as fast as it can. Also a main character was needlessly killed off at the beginning.Honestly though I DID like it. I was never bored and the effects were just perfect. Afterwards though I realized it was all loud music, special effects...and little else. Still it's a perfect summer popcorn movie. For that I give it a 9.",9,0,3,3 June 2006
P.S. I Love You," I wanted to like this but couldn't
","Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and husband Gerry (Gerard Butler) seem to have a happy marriage. Gerry dies of a brain tumor...but it seems he has arranged to have Holly sent messages AFTER his death telling her how to get on with her life.OK--I love silly romance movies. 'Sleepless in Seattle' is one of my favorites. This is VERY silly--but I didn't like it. For starters there are WAY too many love songs in it--I was getting he impression they were trying to sell a soundtrack album and could care less about the movie. Also they (stupidly) keep using clips from classic movies that had nothing to do with the plot. Seriously--WHY is Holly lip syncing to Judy Garland belting out 'The Man Who Got Away'? Also the love 'lessons' here are utterly predictable. It's far too long (over 2 hours), is flatly directed and badly staged. Also some really bad acting doesn't help--Kathy Bates looks blank, Lisa Kudrow is astonishingly lousy at the comic bits (that's inexcusable for someone who was on 'Friends') and James Marsters is given nothing to do. Also Hilary Swank (a wonderful actress) can't do much with a horribly clichéd role. The plot rambles all over the place and there are WAY too many coincidences to believe in this.The few good points: There's a trip to Ireland and the movie makes good use of the beautiful locations there; Gina Gershon is just great in a small role; there's a nice flash of male nudity; Jeffrey Dean Morgan is just great as William (a guy Holly meets in Ireland) and Gerard Butler is fantastic. He's not in the movie too much and he overacts, but his performance is so good and he's so likable and handsome that he gives the movie a much needed jump start.Critics have savaged this. Now it's not good--but it's not a total bomb either. Butler made this movie bearable. I give it a 6.",6,7,14,1 January 2008
Good Will Hunting," Excellent...except for Matt Damon
","A janitor at a MIT is secretly a genuis.  Problem is he has a very mean, vicious streak, no self-esteem and abuses anyone who tries to help him...until he meets his match.Well-directed, beautiful cinematography of Boston and Cambridge (some of the aerial photography was beyond belief), great acting by Robin Wlliams (he won an Oscar), Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver, sharp script, intelligent and very moving with just one problem...Matt Damon.  Unfortunately, he plays the lead character...Will Hunting.He's ugly, mean, sarcastic and gives an absolutely horrible performance.  He wears the same blank expression all through the movie.  Everybody else around him are great and they really carry the show.  Some people have criticized the movie for its frequent profanity, but that's how guys from South Boston talk.  Also Affleck and Damon were born and raised in Cambridge so they have authentic Boston accents.  It helps the tone of the film immensely.So, it's a very very good film.  It could have been great with a better leading man.Well worth seeing...except for Damon.  Concentrate on everything else.",9,1,6,15 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as the first
","Actually, it's better than the first!First off, see 'Fellowship of the Ring' or you won't be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can't wait for 'Return of the King'!",10,2,4,21 January 2003
Across the Universe," I saw it twice! Strange but fun
","This takes place in the late 60s-early 70s. A British man named Jude (Jim Sturgess) goes to America to find his father. He ends up buddies with Max (Joe Anderson) who goes to Columbia. He falls in love with Joe's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). They all end up in NYC--Max is sent off to the war and Jude and Lucy fall in love--but her obsession with stopping the war starts to tear them apart. And characters break into song at any given moment--and they sing Beatles songs! The story is VERY familiar but no one is here for the story. You're seeing this for the imagery and to see HOW they fit 33 Beatles songs into this. The last time Beatles songs were used was in 1978 in the camp 'classic' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. This is nowhere near as bad. The songs work in seamlessly--they just flow out of the characters and it never seems forced. The songs are done very well--everybody on board can sing and the imagery is just incredible. The first song--Sturgees singing the first two stanzas to 'Girl' with no music and a dismal setting just won't leave me. The view of a bunch of men being drafted and carrying the Statue of Liberty to 'She's So Heavy' is both funny and a slap in the face to the Bush administration. And wait till you see Bono (from U2) singing 'I Am the Walrus'! It really blew me away--most of the time I sat there just slack-jawed at what I was seeing. I did enjoy it but there were problems. It was far too long--133 minutes. Also they give characters names from Beatle songs (Lucy, Sadie, Max and JoJo) and then don't even use the songs! Strange. Also one character is introduced coming in through the bathroom window (Get it?). Also there are glaring gaps in the story and characterization--I'm assuming there were cuts in the script or the movie. And Sturgees is OK but doesn't have the charisma to carry the whole film. Still, I saw this film twice in a theatre (I never do that) and liked it even better the second time. I had forgotten some of it. Turning 'With a Little Help From My Friends' into a frat house song is LOTS of fun! So--I did like it but the length and story lapses might bother some people. I give it an 8.",8,7,17,16 September 2007
The Mist," Some good moments destroyed by length
",A bunch of people in Maine are trapped in a supermarket by a mysterious mist that seems to have covered the entire region. It also seems that there are monsters in the mist that kill--but where did the mist and the monsters come from? And will the people ever escape? This was based on a Stephen King novella which I've read a few times. The novella is overlong but good with some really gruesome sequences. The movie has the same problem--it's overlong but nowhere near as compelling as the novella. The script is just simply boring. The people talk on and on and ON about the same things again and again. After a while I started fast forwarding through the dialogue parts because they were so dull! Also Marcia Gay Harden is a superb actress but she gives one of her worst performances here. She's always preaching and is supposed to convince people that God is punishing them--but she continuously has a blank look on her face. Where's the emotion? I didn't believe her for one second.On the plus side Thomas Jane and all the other actors are superb in their roles. Also the film has a few gruesome sequences--they're strong and really work on you. However all this can't change the problem that the film is too long and boring. Also the ending was needlessly depressing. Read the novella instead. I give this a 5.,5,1,4,11 October 2009
The Elephant Man," Stunning but VERY depressing
","Movie based on the life of John Merrick (John Hurt). He was a hideously disfigured man in a freak show treated like a dog. A kind doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) sees him. He wants to teach him how to talk and behave and be accepted by society.David Lynch's second film as a director and it's incredible. It's easily his most accessible film and along with cinematographer Freddie Francis presents us with a gritty and grimy Victorian England. It was shot in black and white which fits the story perfectly. Hurt is wonderful in the title role. He was buried under tons of makeup but he still manages to convey what he's feeling. John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and Anne Bancroft are wonderful in supporting roles. Only Hopkins was bad in his role.Nominated for eight Academy Awards and it got none. A great film that is rarely shown these days. I give it a 10.",10,0,1,24 October 2017
A Quiet Place," Disturbing but fascinating
","This focuses on a family--father Lee (John Krasinski), mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and their two kids. It seems Earth has been invaded by aliens. The aliens are blind but react to sound. When they hear sounds they attack and kill. The family hide out in a remote farmhouse...but can never make a sound or the aliens will attack.It starts off slow but slowly builds up to a final 20-30 minutes that will have you on the edge of your seat. Virtually the entire movie is in dead silence. You have to see this with a dead quiet audience. There is occasionally some background music and even some dialogue but this is sparse. The acting is great by the whole cast (Blunt is superb) and the aliens are incredibly gruesome. It also includes disturbing but not graphic violence. Worth watching but disturbing. Also this deserves an R rating not the PG-13 it got.",8,4,8,13 April 2018
The Game," Good-looking and exciting thriller ruined by a horrible ending
","Wealthy, uncaring, unfeeling Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is visited on his birthday by his good for nothing brother Conrad (Sean Penn). Conrad gives him a card to join CRS (Consumer Recreation Services) and says it will change his life. Nicholas does call and visit and is given a battery of tests and a physical. Then he is released...and CRS starts out to destroy his life and kill him in the process. DEFINITE SPOILERS!!!! This movie looks great and is lots of fun...until the stupid ending. Actually there is a big mistake right at the beginning. We're expected to believe that Nicholas would actually agree to all these tests AND a physical. No way. It doesn't fit his character at all. I was able to accept that though. Then at the end, when we find out it was just a big joke, the movie falls to pieces. There is no possible way all of this could have been planned out. Are we supposed to believe the whole city of San Francisco would just go along with everything? Virtually all of the coincidences couldn't have been possibly been set up. Also there are more than a few moments where people could have died! And really--they take him all the way to Mexico, put him in a grave and expect him to come out of there ALIVE??? Come on! The implausibilities in this are just staggering. But it's all OK cause it turns him into a better, more caring person!!!! I got my limits but this movie went WAY over them!Still I'm giving this a 6 because, for most of its running time, it is exciting, fast-moving and fun. Douglas and Penn are both good and Deborah Kara Unger is excellent as a woman who gets involved in all this. Director Fincher wisely films everything at night or in dark places which just adds to the paranoia of the film. So, I (sort of) recommend it if you can get past the totally stupid ending.",6,0,4,19 February 2011
Kick-Ass," Definitely has its moments but mostly an uneasy mixture of violence and comedy
","An ordinary, comic book obsessed high school kid named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) with no super powers decides to become a super hero named Kick-Ass...with a pretty silly costume. He's almost killed in his first encounter but doesn't let it stop him. He runs into two other super heroes--Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his 11 year old daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). They're trying to get rid of big crime head Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).OK--I never read the graphic novel this was based on so I can't make any comparisons. But, even though I was never bored and laughed out loud more than once, I found this incredibly uneven and troubling. There's plenty of pretty funny jokes (my favorites is when Hit Girl is killing a large number of gangsters and you hear Joan Jett's 'Bad Reputation' playing!) and Cage does a hilarious imitation of Adam West's line readings from the old 'Batman' TV series. Also the acting is good (especially from Johnson who must have been embarrassed wearing that silly costume). The violence is extreme--LOTS of blood and broken bones and body parts--BUT it's shown in quick cuts and it's more comic book than anything else. SPOILERS!!!! However, when Big Daddy and Kick-Ass are captured near the end the film gets WAY too violent and upsetting. Seeing the two of them getting beaten nonstop while hand-cuffed to chairs is just going too far. Also Hit Girl is brutally beaten up by Frank D'Amico (a few members of my audience gasped in shock). It DOES have a happy ending but you go through hell to get there. The premise is good but this film seems more determined to shock the audience than anything else. Also the extreme violence and comedy never mesh together--it's a VERY uneasy mix. I applaud the film for doing something different but the results are mediocre. I give this a 7.",7,4,11,1 May 2010
Coyote Ugly," Colorful, energetic but sexist and dumb
","Small town Jersey girl (Piper Perabo) goes to NYC to be a songwriter.  While waiting to be discovered she serves drinks (and dances on the bar) of a horrible place called Coyote Ugly.  All the bartenders are beautiful, big-breasted, untalented actresses who show as much clevage as a PG-13 rating will allow.  As for the 'plot' it's been done HUNDREDS of times before.  Every single situation and line of dialogue is yawningly predictable.  But most of the screen time is devoted to the half-naked bartenders dancing and twitching and (naturally) poring water all over themselves.  It's a PG 'Showgirls'!  I started fast-forwarding through them--there's too many of them and they are dull--although I must admit the women throw their all into it and seem to be enjoying themselves--too bad they didn't realize the movie is objectifying their bodies.  And what the hell is John Goodman doing here?  Was he really that desperate for the money?  There's a few things that save the film from being a total washout.  It is colorful (the bar has tons of little colored lights), the dancing is energetic and Perabo is a good actress and makes for a very liakable heroine.  Also Adam Garcia...he can't act (and what a stupid accent!) but when you look like him, who cares?  He's very handsome and the movie does show him shirtless a few times (definite highlights).  So, there's half-naked woman and a hunky shirtless Garcia.  If either of those sound good, this is your movie.  Otherwise, stay away--FAR away!!!!!",5,3,6,23 July 2001
Call Me by Your Name," Too long and dull
",This takes place in 1983 Italy. 17 year old Elio (Tinothee Chalmet) meets 24 year old Oliver (Armie Hammer) who's there to help Elio's archaeological father catalog his findings. Elio and Oliver discover they're in love but what can they do? VERY slow-moving gay romance. It moves at a snails pace and gets real boring real quick. Also Chalmet and Hammer are terrible actors. Even worse their characters are obnoxious jerks and you don't care about either one. I seriously considered walking out a few times! However the ending had two very effective moments that had me in tears. Still you have to sit through 2 hours + of boring melodrama to get to it. Not recommended.,2,56,139,4 January 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Beautiful but annoying
","Christian (Ewan McGregor) falls in love with Santine (Nicole Kidman) at the Moulin Rouge. She loves him too, but she's promised to the evil Duke of Worcester (Richard Roxburgh). What will she do? Who cares? The film looks incredible but has quite a few major problems...virtually the whole movie is shot in extreme quick cuts making it difficult to know what's going on; the film veers wildly from comedy to satire to tragedy without ever finding a comfortable medium between them; it's too long; all the 'songs' are just snatches of popular songs from the past--it's not cute or clever, just annoying (and confusing); Kidman (a very good actress) gives a very bad performance and that's no depth in any of the characters so it's really hard to give a damn. Also John Leguiziamo gives one of his worst performances (and that's saying something). The movie has just two pluses--the truly stunning visuals and McGregor gives out a very good performance--and what a beautiful singing voice! He ALMOST saves the movie. Not recommended.",6,3,6,18 June 2001
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not as good as 'Civil War' but not as bad as 'Batman vs. Superman'
",This takes place in 1983 and has the X-Men getting together to battle an ancient alien named Apocalypse who wants to rebuild the world...and run it.Good (sometimes very good) superhero film. There's plenty of action and excitement. However the plot is vague and more than a little convoluted and slow-moving at times. Also some of the heroes (notably Storm and Angel) get very little screen time. Also Cyclops comes across as a bit of a jerk. Worst of all in Nicholas Hoult who is just terrible as Beast...and yes I'm aware he's played him before. Way too thin for the role. However the rest of the actors are all good in their roles. Also Wolverine pops up briefly. His sequence is VERY bloody and violent--way too much for a PG-13 film. By the way it adds nothing to the plot. I'm guessing he was put in just to satisfy the fans. All in all a good film but 'Days of Future Past' was better.,7,4,10,4 July 2016
Meet Joe Black," Far too long and overly serious
","Death takes the body of a dead man (Brad Pitt) and calls himself Joe Black. He gets a rich older man (Anthony Hopkins) to teach him about life (for what reason I've forgotten). He also falls in love the man's beautiful daughter (Claire Forlani).I'm not gloating when I say I saw this up a theatre in 1998. The reviews were negative and the totally ridiculous 3 hour length gave me pause but I liked the cast and it SOUNDED interesting. What I got was an overly serious, slow-moving and frankly boring movie. There are a few (VERY few) good moments her and there but they're totally lost in this boring, sleep-inducing mess. The main problem is the length. This did not need to run three solid hours. I remember at the two hour mark quite a few people walked out of the theatre I saw it in. I can't blame them. I was thinking of joining them but decided to stick it out because I was mildly interested in how it would end. The problem is it had THREE different endings--all were bad and dull. It's a real shame because there's a really good two hour movie here screaming to get out. A pointless waste of celluloid.",1,1,2,2 June 2016
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Wooden acting and slow pace really hurt this one
","Vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) leaves his human lover Bella (Kristen Stewart) because he doesn't want to turn her into a vampire (even though she wants it). She meets hunky Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner)...but he's a werewolf. Seriously! Then things get increasingly stranger.OK--I knew what to expect. I've read all four books of the Twilight series and liked them (except for the last). But what reads well, doesn't PLAY as well in a movie. I actually broke out laughing when someone said to Bella (with a straight face) 'Werewolves aren't the best people to hang around with'...and SHE'S a vampire!!! The plot twists and turns that read so well in the book just did not transfer well to screen. Also the movie was far too long and moved slowly. Even worse, the sexual appeal of Jacob and his brothers was never played up--in a film aimed at a female audience! What really hurt this however was the acting. Kristen Stewart was TERRIBLE as Bella! All her line readings were wooden and her face never changed expression--not once! Lautner was only a LITTLE better than her. Pattinson and his family were great--but they're hardly in the movie. On the plus side the CGI werewolves were impressive and a fight between two of them was lots of fun! But, all in all, the slow pace and dreadful acting really sink this one. I wish they could get rid of Stewart but I'm afraid they're stuck with her. A 5.",5,7,11,5 December 2009
La Grande Illusion," Good but a classic?
","Like some other people have mentioned, why is this a classic.  It's well directed, has two very good performances (Gabin and von Stroheim), but it was kind of boring, seeming much longer than it was, and the anti war message was obvious and done with sledge hammer subtlety.  Maybe back in the late 1930s this was considered powerful, but it hasn't aged well with time. Also we've had other anti war films that are much better.  In fact 'All Quiet on the Western Front' came out in 1931, was also about World War 1 and is twenty times better than this!  Worth seeing, but don't go out of your way.",8,5,18,25 October 1999
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Pretty poor sequel
","The Silver Surfer (Doug Jones with the voice of Laurence Fishburne) is a man all in silver who whizzes around the Earth on a surfboard. He also spreads radiation and causes disasters everywhere he goes. The Fantastic Four (Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis) are hired to do battle with him...but also have to work with their hated enemy Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon). And Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman are trying to get married.The special effects are OK and Gruffudd and Chiklis are good--but that's about it for the good things about this. Some of the special effects are lousy--Mr. Fantastic's stretching looks so fake and why do his clothes stretch with him? Alba's acting is even worse than usual. Evans again seems to be holding back and not doing what he could as the Human Torch. Kerry Washington appears as Alicia Masters--but she's given no introduction. I don't remember her being in the first movie at all, and why is she black? She's white in the comic books. I'm not racist--it's just that you don't go around changing characters from comic books for no rhyme or reason. McMahon is given next to nothing to do as Doom--and what's with his hair (or lack of)? It looked terrible! The script is awful--it gets boring and there are far too many unexplained events (especially the end). SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! Galactus is in this--but he's not personified as he is in the comics. Here he's just some huge intergalactic force that consumes planets. It looks dumb and not at all impressive.The only really good thing I can say about this is it's fairly short--only 92 minutes. Still this is a boring, stupid and confusing movie.

Magic Mike XXL," In some way better than the original
","Takes place three years after the first. Mike (Channing Tatum) is out of the stripping business and owns his own (failing) company. He gets a call from his ex stripper buddies. They're going to a stripper convention and want him to join them for one last time. They go on a road trip to get there and, along the way, encounter many interesting women such as Zoe (Amber Heard), a former girlfriend of Mikes named Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Nancy (Andie MacDowell).The original didn't need a sequel but who cares? We get to see a cast of attractive guys in GREAT shape stripping. The original seemed to go out of its way to NOT objectify the guys as sex objects. Not here! The camera gets up close and comfortable showing how pumped and attractive these guys are. Also the other strippers (Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer and Adam Rodriguez) barely had more than a few words in the original. Here they have fully fleshed out stories and characters. The acting is great (Smith especially was wonderful), the script sharp and the strip acts were incredible. The prime audience for this is women and gay men. As a gay guy I loved it!

Rules of Engagement," OK movie--nothing new
","Plotwise this is nothing--the U.S. government covering up terrorism and trying to set up an innocent man to take the fall. The plot has been done before many times. Basically it's a 'guy movie'--you know, just for men. There are no female main characters at all and Jones and Jackson have a long fistfight in the middle of the movie---for no reason--just to show how masculine they are! Still this movie is well-directed by William Friedken (especially the battle scenes) and has some good acting. However, Tommy Lee Jones is terrible--he seems to be on remote. The best acting comes from Jackson (even though he has very little to work with) and Guy Pearce. The only thing wrong with Pearce is he tries hard to cover his Australian accent, but he ends up sounding like someone from Brooklyn! So, this is an OK movie but nothing special. The direction and acting held my interest.",7,0,1,12 April 2000
Children of Men," Bleak but powerful
","This takes place in Britain in 2027. The world has been hit by a plague or something (we never find out) that makes women unable to give birth. Society begins to crumble. Theo (Clive Owen) is a bureaucrat who distances himself from it all--but he was once an activist. He's drawn back into it all by a former lover (the always great Julianne Moore). There is one pregnant woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who they have to smuggle out of Britain and Theo gets involved.The story is somewhat vague and I'm still not sure what all these characters were about (I'm STILL at a loss to figure out what Michael Caine was doing here) but I was fascinated from start to finish. It is bleak and depressing with no humor or lightness to help you along. There are bloody gunfights and a nonstop air of depression surrounding everything. Still it's not THAT grim. I was able to distance myself from it--I was always aware I was watching a movie. Some people may not be able to do that (a few people were crying when I went).The acting is superb--Moore is never bad and Owen has never been better. His acting anchors the whole movie. You see his character go from unfeeling and uncaring to the other extreme. Even Caine was fun (sort of).I'm not going to get into the politics of the movie--but this seems to be the kind of future President Bush would love. Big Brother is always watching you here--illegal immigrants are routinely caged and brought to camps, people have to carry identity cards and the government has total control over everything. I don't think it could ever happen but it's terrifying to think that it could.A bleak, depressing but just great movie. A 10 all the way.",10,7,15,9 February 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Very inventive
","A stop motion animation musical conceived by Tim Burton. Jack Skellington (voice of Chris Sarandon)is the Pumpkin King who plans and runs Halloween each year. It goes well--but he's bored and wants a change. He discovers Christmas and is overjoyed. He wants to run Christmas too but just doesn't realize that Christmas isn't Halloween. Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara), a stitched together creation, realizes that Jack is wrong and tries to stop him.Bizarre movie (to say the least) but a definite one of a kind. The stop motion animation is beautifully done and some of the visuals are incredibly inventive and effective. Also the songs and music (by Danny Elfman) are lots of fun and perfectly fit the movie. The 'Boogie Oggie' number is a highlight. My only problem with this is a problem I have with other Tim Burton films--it's a bit too dark. I know Burton likes it that way, but this is aimed at kids and I can see some of the younger ones easily being scared of this. Still it's tuneful and there's always something to look at. Also it doesn't overstay its welcome at about 75 minutes. I give it an 8.",8,1,1,11 February 2008
Mulholland Drive," One of Lynch's best
","Betty (Naomi Watts in a fantastic performance) tries to help an amnesiac 'Rita' (Laura Elena Harring) find out who she is.  There's a lot more than that to the plot, but you should see the film yourself to find out.  Almost as good as 'Blue Velvet', this is David Lynch's newest mind trip.  It makes sense for an hour and 45 minutes (it was originally a pilot for a TV series that was rejected by ABC) but then things change drastically and images (and characters) go barelling out of control...but that's expected from Lynch. Characters and things change in very unexpected ways...alternate realities seem to step in.  Or do they?  This last section is wide open to interpretation--like the best Lynch films this demands multiple viewings. If you're a Lynch fan (like me) or if you like films that are adult and challenge you, go see it.  If not, stay away.  Also, there's a not so explicit lesbian love scene.",10,20,35,5 November 2001
Guardians of the Galaxy," Very good comic book movie
","Movie follows Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and a band of various characters--green-skinned vicious Gamora (Zoe Saldana), muscle-bound angry Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot a talking tree (voice of Vin Diesel)and an angry raccoon named Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). They're trying to keep an orb out of the hands of a bad guy determined to rule and destroy the universe with it.OK--I liked this but I didn't love it. It moves quickly, the special effects are incredible (especially in 3-D), there's plenty of action and fights and Rocket is LOTS of fun. However there are gaps in plot and story (I'm assuming they're saving them for the sequel), it gets way too sentimental at times (they keep cramming the message that friends are good down your throat) and I didn't think Pratt was all that good. He's all handsome and muscular but I thought his acting was pretty bad. I didn't find him endearing or that interesting. Actually none of the acting was that impressive. Rocket comes across as the most engaging character in the film (seriously--how often do you get to see a raccoon with an attitude?). Also I didn't find it that funny. There were plenty of amusing lines but that's all they were--amusing. I didn't laugh once. Still it was a fun summer movie. Worth catching.",8,3,7,13 August 2014
Evil Dead," A so-so redo of the classic
","Five 20-somethings go to a cabin in the woods to help their friend Mia (Jane Levy) go cold turkey from drugs. They are Mia, her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), his gf Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), friend Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and her bf Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Naturally they find the Book of the Dead, open it and Eric reads aloud the incarnation to resurrect the demons. They possess Mia first and make it clear that they're all gonna die.I remember seeing the original back in 1981 in a small theatre in Boston. I remember being scared silly by the over the top graphic gore, gruesome makeup, creepy music and the gallons of fake blood that was used. It was unrated (no one under 17 admitted)made on no budget and caught everybody by surprise by becoming a huge hit (although most critics tore it apart). This can't duplicate it but they try. They use practical non-CGI effects which helps. They pour on the blood and gore (how this got an R rating is beyond me). There are quite a few very scary moments--especially when an undead girl goes after her bf. But, all in all, it was just OK. With the sole exception of Levy the acting is pretty bad with Fernandez being the worst. He's a handsome man but totally blank. People do incredibly stupid things a lot--especially Eric. The story gets stupider and stupider and makes absolutely no sense by the end. If you're just seeing this for gore you'll love it. Otherwise you might not. I can truthfully only give it a 5.",5,30,59,7 April 2013
Caddyshack," Lousy 'comedy'
","Silly comedy about an exclusive, snobbish country club golf course 'invaded' by slobs (The original ad read: 'The snobs vs. the slobs'). The snobs are headed by Ted Knight--the slobs by Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield. Bill Murray is also on hand to kill a gopher that's destroying the course. It's one of those 80s comedies that thinks very crude humor and destruction is hilarious. There's also a dull dramatic back story with Michael O'Keefe as a caddy trying to get to college.I remember this being pretty funny back in 1980--it hasn't aged well at all.The humor is pretty disgusting and totally unfunny (especially a sequence involving a Baby Ruth candy bar). Murray is just horrible as the grounds keeper--not even remotely funny, just dull. Also the gopher he's chasing is shown by one of the stupidest puppets I've ever seen. And Knight isn't funny at all--he's just loud and abrasive and overacting a LOT!There are some good things about this--Chase has some good moments; O'Keefe is OK and Rodney Dangerfield is hilarious! He's the only reason to see this movie--he has some truly funny lines. Also the soundtrack isn't bad. See it for Dangerfield--fast forward through the rest. A huge hit in its day (primarily because of Chase, Murray and Dangerfield).",6,1,9,24 September 2004
The Evil Dead," A gore classic
","A bunch of college kids take a weekend trip to a remote cabin in the woods. They unwittingly resurrect the evil dead--spirits who can possess them and have them kill each other off. The only way to get rid of them? Bodily dismemberment.In terms of plot this is pretty lame--there are a few lapses in logic that are annoying. Characterizations are nonexistent and the acting is bad (even Bruce Campbell!). But the film moves like lightning with some very imaginative direction by Sam Raimi. And when the evil dead attack after the first half hour, the movie goes barreling out of control. Tons of gore, blood and violence are thrown in your face with great sound effects and some truly gruesome makeup. Also it's kind of funny--notice how many times Campbell is covered with blood but his face is clean and his clothes dry in the very next shot!This was made back in 1981 on next to no budget by a bunch of college students. It's incredible what they achieved with so little to work with. Also there are two or three incredible tracking shots that I can't get enough of!This was dismissed by horrified film critics back then (I remember one reviewer was so disgusted he requested that every single print should be burnt!), but it slowly grew into quite a hit. It's now considered a modern day classic. And Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell jump started their careers with this.So ignore the plot and concentrate on the imaginative direction, gore, special effects and sound. For horror movie fans this is a must.WARNING: There is a very tasteless sequence in which a woman is raped by a tree!",10,11,16,18 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Just astounding
","The Bride (Uma Thurman) was beaten and shot multiple times and left for dead on her wedding day.  She survives but is in a coma.  Four years later she wakes up and sets out to kill everyone who tried to kill her.Quentin Tarantino is back in full throttle!  This movie just keeps going for 90 minutes and doesn't stop.  Film references fly all over the place (love the Brian DePalma homage with the split screens) and there's virtual non-stop action.  Thurman's fight with Vivica A. Fox is fast and violent. Even better is her trying to get to Lucy Liu and having to cut her way through (literally) a few hundred guys.  Limbs go flying, people are cut in half, tons of blood goes sprewing all over...it's VERY violent.  But it's really not that bad--it's so overdone it's impossible to take seriously...I was always well aware that I was watching a movie.  The acting is great--Thurman is just perfect as The Bride.  You know precious little about her but I really felt for her and cared whenever she was hurt in battle.  Fox is great and Liu is controlled but very good.  Also it's great to HEAR David Carradine (you don't see him), see Daryl Hannah and Julie Dreyfuss is just great as Sofie.One complaint--Miramax cut Tarantino's film into two parts.  The original cut runs 3 hours--they CLAIMED that was too long.  Oh really?  I didn't hear anybody complaining about 'Gone With the Wind' running almost 4 hours or the two 'Lord of the Rings' movies each running over 3.  Miramax is just making you pay twice to see one movie--a REAL cheap stunt...I guess they're taking lessons from Disney (their parent company).  Still, don't let that keep you away.  This is a violent, bloody and absolutely fascinating movie with great acting and a good script.  What more could you ask for.  Also it's among IMDB's top 100 films...that should tell you something!",10,2,8,4 November 2003
Saw II," I'm shocked--a GOOD horror film sequel!
","'Saw' was one of last year's best horror films--grim, brutal, no stupid jokes and VERY dark. I expected the worst when I heard a sequel was coming. I was shocked to find it just as disturbing as the original.The film opens right up with a young guy trapped in a mask-like creation. There are spikes all over it--but he has the key. Problem is it's embedded BEHIND his eye and he has to cut his eye to get it out! He's been put here by Jigsaw--a serial killer who punishes people for things they do wrong.It involves a bunch of people that Jigsaw has trapped in a house together. There seems to be no way out--and a deadly poison is being pumped through the air vents. If they don't get out in two hours they'll die. But Jigsaw tells them there IS a way out--they just have to find it for themselves with obscure clues he gives...and there are multiple, gory booby traps they have to watch for...Meanwhile the police HAVE Jigsaw and try to get him to reveal where the house is...Sounds like another stupid horror film but, like the first film, there's no humor and the killings are brutal and bloody. It also tells us the back story of Jigsaw and why he's doing all this. It brings up questions of morality--Jigsaw is doing this for a reason--but what gives him the right to torture people? It makes you think and, at the same time, you're trying to figure out the clues Jigsaw keeps giving the people to get out. It all comes together at the end and throws in multiple clever plot twists that I didn't see coming.Be warned--this is a bloody, brutal film but VERY well-made and disturbing. I walked out of the theatre shaken and thinking about the questions the film brought up. There are no easy answers. I hope there's a third movie as good as this! I give it an 8 only because it's not really a movie you enjoy...",8,7,16,1 November 2005
Paranormal Activity," Has its moments but it's basically 'Blair Witch Project' in a house
","A young couple in their 20s--Katie (Katie Featherstone) and Micah (Micah Sloat)--have a poltergeist invading their home and targeting Katie. They want to get rid of it but this thing doesn't want to leave...This film has been WAY over-hyped. The studio only showed it at midnight showings and the coming attractions supposedly showed an actual audience screaming and jumping at the movie. To make things worse they 'suggested' that all these things happened--although the closing credits makes it clear that it's all fictional! 'The Blair Witch Project' did this successfully 10 years ago but it's old hat now. I can see why they over-hyped this movie. It's hardly new or original and, aside from a few moments, you've seen this all before. The plot is also full of head-scratching moments. Supposedly Katie has been haunted by this poltergeist since she was 8--and she waits till she moves in with Micah to tell him about it? Why do the attacks intensify so suddenly? Katie is a student but she never seems to leave the house. Her mood swings come out of nowhere and serve no purpose to the plot. Also Micah is given almost zero character development. He does stupid things for no reason (the Ouija board) and just ends up saying 'f***' all the time.On the good side the movie does have it's spooky moments, Featherstone and Sloat are very good in their roles and the ending actually scared me (although I saw it coming). But, all in all, it's a good hour long movie stretched out to 90 minutes. Don't believe all the hype--it's not that good. I give it a 5.",5,3,8,15 October 2009
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Ultron? More like Age of BOREDOM!
","Bad sequel to the fantastic 2012 'The Avengers'. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to jumpstart a system to keep peace all over the Earth. Things go wrong and they create a being called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) who sets out to destroy all humans. It's up to the Avengers to stop them but he's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics about why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the dialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these people are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new superheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly introduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost 150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects are flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action sequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a disastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and pointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects and action.",5,26,53,13 May 2015
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Very strange but GREAT!
","Tard to follow (at times) but fascinating story about a transsexual rock singer named Hedwig and her quest for fame, fortune and love. Impossible to describe, but a pleasure to watch. Never stops moving and extremely well-directed by John Cameron Mitchell (who also gives a wonderful performance as Hedwig). The songs are loud and good, performed with gusto and tons of energy. A rare Hollywood film that doesn't play it safe with its sexual content and doesn't wimp out at the end. A one of a kind film and well worth seeing.",8,39,43,20 June 2001
The Insider," Needs editing--A LOT!!!
","Yeah, it's well acted, yeah it's got an intelligent script but those two elements do NOT make a great movie.  This movie is a (needless) 2 hours and 35 minutes.  There's no suspense (anyone who reads the newspaper or watches TV knows how it's going to end) and we get ENDLESS scenes repeating the same themes (tobacco industry is dangerous; CBS backed out; yadda, yadda, yadda). How this is getting good reviews is beyond me.  I saw it in a packed movie house.  When the film was over a lot of people came out complaining about the length and pointing out how half an hour could have been cut with NO loss to the story!  Director Mann has made great long movies (Heat), but remember this guy is also responsible for real crap (The Keep). Unfortunately this falls somewhere in between.  Wait for the video, so you can fast forward through the boring stuff (about half the movie).",5,2,8,8 December 1999
Quiz Show," Overlong but engrossing
","Based on the 1950s TV quiz show scandal. Unbalanced Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) is winning on TV quiz show '21'. However he is told to answer questions wrong so he can lose and all-American boy type Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) can win. Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) investigates for the government.I have no idea how factual this movie is (I heard not very) but it plays very well. The 1950s era is captured perfectly (especially the obsession with TV), the script is sharp and direction by Robert Redford is assured. Acting all across the board is great--especially by Turturro, Fiennes and David Paymer as an evil TV executive. Morrow is also good--but he tries to imitate a Boston accent and fails miserably (I should know--I have it!). It's a big distraction in the movie. The biggest problem though is this is far too long--130 minutes. There are many scenes that could have been shortened or excised completely.Still, it's extremely compelling and worth catching. I give it an 8.",8,0,0,4 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Too dark, too long and far too violent
","OK--this review will be FULL OF SPOILERS so please read it at your own risk.Batman (Christian Bale) is trying to clean up Gotham City with Police Chief Gordon (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) and crusading D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). However a psychotic madman named the Joker (Heath Ledger) wants to take over Gotham (for no discernible reason) and kill the Batman. His plans get increasingly more diabolical, many people die and Batman starts to wonder if he can stop the Joker...and if he's responsible for him.OK--I realize the Batman movies are supposed to be dark--but THIS dark??? This movie is chock full of violence--people are casually shot to death left and right(but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). There are some spectacular stunts here but all the violence and dark tone rob them of any of the wonder they might have had. There's next to no light moments and the movie gets increasingly depressing as it goes on. And the Joker casually hurts or kills people with no warning. There's also a thoroughly despicable scene where a little child is threatened with a gun. This deserved an R--NOT a PG-13.The needlessly convoluted story doesn't help. The movie goes on far too long (lots of people in my theatre were checking the time during the last hour) and gets confusing. Characters appear and disappear with alarming infrequency and one character (the guy who was going to reveal Batman's secret identity) disappears completely with no resolution to his story! The Joker here is rightly played as a psychotic madman but Ledger is NOT good in the role. His speeches sound stilted and he's not really acting at all. His character isn't frightening--just incredibly annoying. I found it hard to believe that all these characters were stupid enough to buy his 'explanations'. Also he plans some explosions and plots that are just impossible--even in a comic book movie.Acting does help. Bale is just excellent--he's not getting enough praise for his acting. He manages to show Batman's anger and pain even in that padded suit and mask! Eckhart is just superb as Harvey Dent--and Two-Face later on. Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking over for Katie Holmes) and Michael Caine (as Alfred) were also good. Surprisingly Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman aren't that good. They seem to be phoning in their performances. Ledger--what can I say? He's WAY over praised. He was OK but all this talk of an Academy Award is just ridiculous! He wasn't that good. His death was tragic and I can't imagine what his family is going through--but a tragic death does not automatically make you a great actor.I basically found this movie too dark, too violent and even dull! Some of the acting and fantastic special effects can only work a little. This gets a 3 from me.",3,20,48,15 August 2008
Annie Hall," One of Allen's best
","Next to 'Manhattan' this is Woody Allen's best film.It chronicles the relationship and breakup of Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). That's it for plot, but it has an Oscar-winning script by Allen and Marshall Brickman which is overflowing with hilarious lines and sequences and also some sharp, on target insights about love, sex and relationships. It's basically just one great scene after another.Keaton is superb in her Oscar-winning role--she's sweet, lovable and endearingly off kilter. Also her very interesting wardrobe started a big fashion trend in the late 70s--the Annie Hall Look. Allen is good also but his character is whiny and annoying--as he should be. Allen's direction is just great also, but he topped it 2 years later with 'Manhattan'. Just simply a masterpiece--it deserved every Oscar it won. Don't miss this one!",10,7,13,9 December 2004
"Girl, Interrupted"," Passable
","OK movie based on a true story about a young woman who spent two years in an exclusive mental ward in MA. Sounds interesting and should be harrowing, but it isn't. All the characters are the same types we've seen in other movies like this in the past (The Bell Jar, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden). The plot makes escaping the ward laughably easy and makes a mental ward look kind of fun (and boring). All the characters talk in clichés and by the last hour of the movie I was ahead of the plot constantly. It gets dull when you know exactly what's going to happen. The acting is no help--Ryder used to be good. What's happened to her? She has basically one expression that she uses the whole movie. Whoppi Goldberg is VERY toned down and miserable (at least she looks it). Redgrave barely makes an impression as the head of the hospital. Only Jolie shows any spark of life. She's enjoying every second of her role and it shows. Unfortunately, she can't carry the whole movie. So it's OK but predictable. Worth a video rental (maybe). Great soundtrack though.",6,1,1,24 January 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Selt-indulgent, painfully slow and just boring
","There are spoilers throughout this review.This starts at the 'Dawn of Man'. A bunch of apes find a black monolith and start to evolve slowly. Then it cuts to 2001. A black monolith has been discovered on the moon--buried. When the light hits the monolith it starts to emit a message to the moons of Jupiter. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and some other astronauts (in suspended animation) are sent to Jupiter to investigate. However their computer HAL (with the creepy voice of Douglas Rain) goes crazy and kills everybody except for Dullea. Dullea gets to Jupiter and 'enters' a black monolith floating in space. He's then in a room being watched over by alien beings. He ages rapidly and dies...but becomes a 'star child'. It seems he has been chosen (for whatever reason) to show the next step in evolution to man. Basically the monolith is a gift from some alien beings who watch over the entire universe. They helped the human race evolve. The monolith on the moon was buried so man would dig it up. When they got to it the signal sent to Jupiter was to alert the aliens that man was ready for his next step.That's MY view of it. Everybody has different interpretations of this movie.I have vague recollections of seeing this back in 1968 at the age of 6 (the film is G rated). I remember the apes at the beginning scaring me...and then falling asleep. Since then I've seen it multiple times at revival theatres and, on one occasion, saw a brand new print with stereo at a play house. Yes--the special effects are impressive. Yes--the music is great. But the movie is long, far too slow and just boring! It moves at such a slow pace that it's sleep-inducing. There's very little dialogue but that's a blessing because what there is is pretty lousy. The human characters have no personality whatsoever and speak in monotones and simple short sentences. Lockwood and Dullea are supposedly buddies but I never got the feeling that they even liked each other! This isn't anything against either actor--these poor guys are given nothing to work with. For instance when HAL kills Lockwood and the other astronauts what's Dullea's reaction? Nothing. He barely raises an eyebrow. I don't blame Dullea--I think he was just playing it like director Stanley Kubrick told him. How can you care about characters who are given no personality or motivations? You know there's a problem when HAL comes across as more real than Poole and Bowman! Also HAL gets paranoid and kills Frank. Could someone please tell me how a COMPUTER gets paranoid???? They give an explanation (sort of) in '2010' but it was pretty stupid. There are a few good things about this. Douglas Rains' voice of HAL is suitably creepy. Lockwood strips down to his shorts at one point showing his muscular body. The entrance into the star gate is still impressive (if far too long).People seem to forget that a lot of people hated this movie when it first came out. MGM executives thought they had a disaster on their hands and most people couldn't make heads or tales out of the plot. During a break in a premiere screening for studio executives someone said, 'Something better happen in the second half or we're dead!' But, inexplicably, audiences seemed to love it and it's now regarded as a masterpiece. Aside from being thoroughly bored by it I find it cold and impersonal too. The message seems to be that man is an insignificant little thing in the universe. It's all in the hands of these gods and you can't do anything to change it. That's a pretty creepy message but the movie drags out everything to a ridiculous degree. Boring, slow and sleep-inducing. The 2 is for the special effects and Dullea and Lockwood (I like both actors despite this movie).",2,41,83,23 October 2008

","I first saw this film (edited) on TV when I was 16.  I loved it!  It 'spoke' to me.  I understood the conflict Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) was going through.  Now 20 years later, I STILL love it!  If anything, I understand it more this time!  The acting, direction, soundtrack are all superb.  This is one those rarities--a movie that doesn't date at all.  A must-see!  TRy to see it letterboxed--the full screen version doesn't capture the incredible direction (and renders a few scenes incomprehensible).",10,12,21,7 June 2000
Singin' in the Rain," One of the best Hollywood musicals
","This isn't my all time favorite (that goes to 'Meet me in St. Louis') but this is definitely in the top 10. This is a fictitous musical comedy of the 1920s when silent films became 'talkies'. It chronicles how it affects Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), his leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and Lockwood's new girlfriend Kathey Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, 'Make 'Em Laugh', 'Beautiful Girl', 'Good Morning' on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: 'Fit as a Fiddle' which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and 'Would You?' at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his 'Make Em' Laugh' number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem. This remains one of the 10 best movie musicals ever made. HIGHLY recommended!",10,95,125,22 January 2005
The Mummy Returns," Loud, silly, PG-rated violence...
","basically a typical summer blockbuster!  I saw it at a sneak preview last night and I mostly liked it.  The action is virtually non-stop, the special effects (except for one monster at the end) are incredible and the film never stops moving.  But the plot makes no sense (something about a Scorpion King and the Mummy fighting), characterizations are nonexistent and there's some truly awful dialogue.  Also in a movie that takes place in the 1930s, terms like 'Are we there yet?' 'Whatever...' and 'Get a room' did not exist! That may be nitpicking, but it bothered me.  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah all reprise their roles from the original.  They're all very good here...too bad they have nothing to play with.  But, I was never bored. It's a movie where you turn off your mind, sit back and enjoy the ride.  In other words, a very good summer movie!",7,3,6,2 May 2001
Avatar," Simplistic and boring
","Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine who travels to the world of Pandora to do what he thinks is protecting the Earth. The natives of that world are said to be vicious and cruel. By transforming into one of them in his sleep (or something) he realizes they are NOT the evil ones and he begins to have serious doubts about his mission. This leads to an all out battle at the end.Basically this is cowboys vs. Indians in outer space. This is VERY easy to follow and understand which is the main problem. Everything here is totally and utterly predictable! You've seen these characters and situations all before. I was always one or two steps ahead on the plot and this isn't good for a movie that runs a needless 165 minutes. This could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes. Some people find getting into the world of the aliens is fascinating. I wasn't fascinated at all--just thoroughly and utterly bored! To make matters worse the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book and the characters are either evil or good--no shades of grey or ambiguity. The movie also preaches it's against war but 'entertains' us with an all out battle at the end. Lots of people agree that the plot is light but the incredible special effects make up for it. Not for me! Yeah the special effects are impressive (especially in 3-D) but that isn't enough for such a long movie with a dull storyline. I can't really comment on the acting here considering no one is given a character to play--they're all walking, talking clichés. Only two people stand out--Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver. Worthington is very handsome with beautiful eyes and a cute little Australian accent. Weaver is strong and commanding playing a scientist.I will admit the battle at the end was (kind of) fun but I was mostly bored silly throughout this. I kept looking at my watch patiently waiting for this to end. I have to admit I'm in the minority here. It's gotten rave reviews from critics and has already broken box office records. I attended a 4:30 show on a Saturday afternoon--and it was sold out! It's also among the top 50 movies here on IMDb. I guess a lot of people like predictable stories with non-stop special effects and cardboard characters. I need something more than that. The 2 is only for the effects and hot Worthington.",2,30,52,10 January 2010
Toy Story 2," Fun for kids and adults
","OK, it's not up to the original, but it comes REAL close.  My only complaint is that the original was funnier--this one had it's share of dead spots. Still, the animation was incredible, the jokes work on a level for adults AND children, the plot moves quickly, the voices all fit the characters and the movie has none of those nauseating songs that Disney usually throws in their movies (you know--the ones that are so sugary you can get cavities just watching them!).  Well done, entertaining, leaves you smiling--what else can you ask for?",9,0,1,21 December 1999
Drag Me to Hell," Better than most PG-13 horror films...but that's faint praise
",Bank loan office Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is forced to evict old Mrs. Ganuch (Lorna Raver) from her house. Mrs. Ganuch places a curse on her and Christine's life becomes a living hell.This has been overpraised by some critics. Yes--it's well-directed. Yes--I jumped a few times (but that was from the loud noises on the soundtrack). Yes--it WAS funny. But was it scary? No. Did it make much sense? No. Director and co-writer Sam Raimi made 'Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2'. They were VERY gory (and both unrated) and full of pitch black humor and were genuinely scary. Unfortunately Raimi here seems to be held back by that all-important PG-13 rating. The scenes are somewhat gross and funny--but never scary. I kept getting the feeling that Raimi was forced to pull back because of the rating. The minimal gore should have been more extreme and the humor darker--but it never was. The only sequence which went full out was a truly funny and somewhat scary exorcism at the end. THAT one sequence managed to be more chilling than anything else in the movie. This isn't terrible by any means but I couldn't stop thinking of how much better it might have been if Raimi had been given complete creative control.Acting isn't really important in this but Justin Long (as Christine's boyfriend) and Raver were pretty good. Lohman is just OK but she deserves credit for taking on which must have been a VERY exhausting role. I can honestly only give this a 6--and most of that is for the direction and special effects (wait till you see the goat at the exorcism!).,6,4,12,29 May 2009
Grindhouse," Just fantastic!!!!
",Incredible 3 hours+ double feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino with fake coming attractions mixed in. First up is 'Planet Terror' by Rodriguez which has a hot shot guy (Freddy Rodriguez) and his tough as nails girlfriend (Rose McGowan) fighting flesh eating zombies with others. Among other cast members are Michael Biehn and Josh Brolin. It successfully imitates a stupid sleazy grind house horror film with large does of (purposefully) fake-looking gore and plays it straight while poking fun of itself. And wait for when McGowan gets the weapon for a leg! Next is Tarantino's 'Death Proof' with Kurt Russell as a stuntman who uses his indestructible car to kill people. It starts off slow but all leads up to a climatic battle which is just incredible and had my audience cheering and yelling along! In between there are fake trailers for movies such as 'Werewolf Women of the SS' (great to see Sybil Danning again) and others.These movies were supposed to look cheap. Rodriguez' does with rips and tears (and a whole missing reel) but Tarantino's doesn't. It's virtually crystal clear with shots that no grind house movie would ever have. Still all is forgiven with that incredible final battle. I can't remember the last time I've seen an audience so whipped up by a movie! The cast for both movies play there roles completely straight. McGowan (who's in both) is lots of fun and Russell is a scream in his role--I LOVED it when he winked at the camera! Also Rodriguez was really good (and very attractive) in his role. Nobody is bad but those three stand out.I can only give this a 9 for a few reason--'Planet Terror' does have its slow spots and 'Death Proof' starts off very slow. Also one of the coming attraction done by Eli Roth ('Thanksgiving') was overly gory and just sick (it had to be cut to get an R rating). Roth obviously doesn't know how to do comedy...or movies for that matter.Still this is a fun and rousing film. The 3 hours+ plus just flew by. Highly recommended.,9,2,6,14 April 2007
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A Twilight film I actually LIKE:)
","This picks right off where Part 1 took off. Bella (Kristen Stewart) gave birth to a baby right before she was changed (into a vampire) by husband Edward (Robert Pattinson). Everything is fine but then the Volturi hear about the baby being half vampire/half human and fear that it is an abomination that must be destroyed. They travel to the USA to deal with it while the Cullens get vampires from all over on their side to help them.OK--this could have been easily done in one film. Like part 1 this film moves VERY slowly and, has subplots that lead to nowhere and has quite a few needless song montages. Also Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner give horrible performances, Michael Sheen overacts to an embarrassing degree and the dialogue is terrible and this doesn't make a lot of sense. Still I liked it a LOT! The cinematography is beautiful (especially on a wide screen), except for Lautner and Stewart the acting is great and there's a fantastic final battle that easily makes up for all the problems the film has. It's long, violent and brutal--my audience (composed of mostly teenage girls) LOVED it. So not a great movie but the beautiful cinematography and final battle made it worth seeing.",8,5,13,23 November 2012
La La Land," Dazzling
","An original Hollywood musical shot in Cinemascope and BRIGHT Tehnicolor. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a failed jazz musician and Mia (Emma Stone) s failed actress meet cute and fall in love. It follows their relationship over the course of a year. It all leads to a happy if bittersweet ending that literally had me sobbing in my seat.The film looks gorgeous, the original score is great and the songs and dances are performed very energetically by the cast. It looks just like a 1950s Hollywood musical right down to the cars and clothes. There's also plenty of references to the old musicals sprinkled throughout. However this just misses the mark of being a great musical for one thing--I didn't really like the two main characters. Sebastian is a bit of a jerk and very arrogant. He's always talking about jazz which gets annoying. Mia is sweet but always seems depressed and dour all the time. I'm not blaming the actors--I blame the script. The acting is great but the characters aren't. I never warmed to them at all. Still all was forgiven during the last 10 minutes which, as I said, had me crying out loud. Also the individual music numbers throughout the picture are GREAT! So it's a VERY good musical that I recommend. Just bring plenty of tissues for the end.",8,4,10,5 January 2017
Saw," Very unpleasant but it IS a horror film
","Grim, sadistic story of a maniac who tortures people in various ways. He gives them ways to live but they have to do something morally wrong to get that. One woman has a device that will rip her jaw open. The key is inside the stomach of a live man--she has to cut it out of him. In this one two men are chained to pipes on either side of a disgusting bathroom. Between them is a dead body. The killer leaves them clues to free themselves---but if that don't do it in an allotted amount of time--they'll be left to rot there and die.The film is grim, dark and extremely disturbing. There's not one bit of humor in it--it's very much like the movie 'Se7en'. The acting is superb and the tension builds slowly. The final act is very violent, brutal and does NOT have a happy ending. I was left shaking but it scared me---and that's exactly what a horror film should do. The only negative it left room (sigh) for a SEQUEL! But that's to be expected nowadays.Worth seeing for horror fans with strong stomaches but brace yourself. I give it an 8.",8,5,12,13 November 2004
Mama," Some scary moments but silly story
","Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) are to bring up two little girls that have spent five years alone in the woods. They're Lucas' nieces and were left there by Lucas' brother. They try to help the girls recover...but don't realize that the girls had help surviving for all those years with a creature they call 'mama' and 'mama' is not going to give up her children without a fight.It's well-done, the acting is good and there are a number of places where you're guaranteed to jump...but I found this unsatisfying. I found the revelation of what the mama is pretty silly and the back story got very confusing towards the end. I found the ending wildly overdone too. Still it DID scare me a few times and it had a very creepy atmosphere so it's OK.",6,1,1,1 December 2013
The Hurricane," Well-done with great acting
","The only problem with this film is it's length...it's 2 1/2 hours--way too long.  But the basic true story and the acting (especially by Washington) keep it interesting.  Worth seeing--just don't accept it as gospel truth, and be prepared for the length.",7,1,8,23 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Dated
","Story takes place in the future. It's about Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and his 'droggs' (friends) who go about and rape, rob and kill people just for kicks. Alex is caught and goes through a sadistic form of therapy to cure his violent impulses. It works...or does it?This was considered a masterpiece in 1971. It was pretty strong stuff (the original rating was X in the US and it was banned completely in Britain) and introduced the term 'ultraviolence' into our language. I loved it all the times I saw it in the 1980s (at least 7 times). I did think it was sexist (notice the decor at the bar) but found the ideas and themes fascinating.Seen now it's very dated. The violence in it is not even remotely shocking anymore and the ideas and ultimate message in the film (which totally changes the ending of the book) are old hat by now. To put in bluntly the film bores me now. It is extremely well made by Kubrick (the sequence with the 'William Tell Overture' was great and how can you resist Beethoeven?) and powerfully acted (McDowell was just perfect) but it drags and I'm more bored than anything by it now. Perhaps I saw it too much in the 80s...I'm giving it a 7--for its time it was very powerful...sadly, it just doesn't hold up. And I know I'm going to hear from those Kubrick fanatics who thinks everything he did was genius (even 'The Shining'). Let the attacks begin!",7,5,18,25 May 2003
From Hell," Johnny Depp vs. Jack the Ripper
","A police inspector (Johnny Depp) in 1888 London tries to capture Jack the Ripper.  Unfortunately, he falls in love with one of his intended victims (Heather Graham).  Very loud (WAY too many shots and sounds of stairs coming down from carriages--the sound is ear-splitting!), dark and confusing.  The movie looks fantastic--there are some breath-taking shots of Victorian London.  But, plotwise, it's a mess.  It moves quickly but is very confusing at the beginning, way too plot heavy (the film is almost 150 minutes) for its own good and throws in hallucinatory images ad nauseum (Depp has too many drug-induced 'visions').  The acting helps--Depp is excellent in his role--he looks very handsome and nicely underplays it.  Graham is good but looks terrible--way too pale and drab (but then, she IS playing a prostitute).  The film doesn't skimp on blood and gore--there's not a lot of violence, but when there is it's not pretty.  Ultimately, the film is too long, too grim and too depressing to really enjoy.  Still the producers/directors the Hughes Brothers are talented men.  Let's see more of them.",7,6,12,22 October 2001
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A sick disgusting piece of garbage
","OK I got the message in the film (already voiced by just everybody else), but I think this film is one of the most disgusting, sick, vile pieces of garbage ever made. The film actually left a bad taste in my mouth and I almost threw up! Rape, torture, sexual humiliation, sadism, scatology--you name it, this movie has it! Pasolini made some good films ('Arabian Nights')--too bad this was his last one. I was 'lucky' enough to see it in a theatre a few years ago--the audience groaned and booed and hissed at the end. Pasolini did NOT have to throw ever single torture and degradation in our faces--he seems to actually enjoy it! He could have made his point without being so needlessly sick. Some people go on and on saying this is a masterpiece. Bull! It's just a sick, degrading movie that tries to make a point (absolute power corrupts) while just pushing offensive material into the audiences faces. This film is no artistic achievement--it's, in my book, the worst film ever made. UPDATE! Criterion released it about a year ago and people are going on and on saying Criterion only releases artistic films of merit. Uh huh (EXTREME sarcasm). They did a special edition on Michael Bay's 1998 movie 'Armageddon' which is easily one of the stupidest films ever made. Just because Criterion released it does not make it any masterpiece of cinema.",1,14,40,28 January 2000
Total Recall," Violent, stupid but fun
","Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid. He lives on Earth in the future with a loving wife (Sharon Stone) and a good life.  But he keeps having dreams about Mars and another woman.  Then he finds out they might be more than just dreams...There's a lot more going on in the plot but I won't spoil it.  This came out in the summer of 1990.  It was a huge hit but was attacked by many critics who complained about the extreme violence in the film.  Seen today it still IS very violent (I'm surprised it got by with a R rating) but...it's just a movie.  Also, if you don't take the film too seriously (and you shouldn't) it actually gets kind of amusing.  There's plenty of blood and dead bodies (and body parts) flying around but it's really hard to take it realistically.The plot is very complicated--too much.  The twists and turns keep you guessing but there are a LOT of plot holes in this.  Two huge examples--How did Melina know they were going to take Quaid down the service elevator when she saves him and who (or what) IS Quatro?  We see him/it but it's never explained why he's viewed as a God.  And the constant product placement is Venusville was very obvious (and annoying).  Still, I DO recommend this movie.The movie moves very quickly (it's directed by the great Paul Verhoeven), the violence keeps things interesting and the acting is not bad. Schwarzenegger (surprisingly) is pretty good in the main role.  Stone really sucks in her role but this movie was her breakthrough.  Michael Ironside is lousy too--but then he always is.  However Rachel Ticotin is great as the heroine and Ronny Cox has lots of fun as Cohaagen, the slimy villain (although supposedly he was appalled at the amount of violence in the film). The special effects are great (no crappy CGI was available back then) and there's a GREAT cat fight between Stone and Ticotin.So it's fast, extremely violent and lots of fun.  Just don't think about the plot too much.  Recommended.",8,3,7,3 April 2004
Rocky," The first was the best
","Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a second-rate boxer in Philadelphia, gets a match with the world champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers).  Also he falls in love with mousy Adrienne (Talia Shire) who blossoms with his love.  He's trained by a tough-as-nails (but loving) trainer (Burgess Meredith).This is the type of story that was being laughed off screens in the 1940s...but it works beautifully here.  The characters are believable, flawed human beings; the script is just great (written by Stallone before he became full of himself) and (surprisingly) all the acting is good (Meredith and Shire take top honors).  The theme music is rousing and the climatic fight is just fantastic.  It's predictable as they come, but it's all so well-done you won't care.  A HUGE hit in 1976.  As much as I like this I still can't believe it won the Best Picture Oscar back in 1977.  Still, don't miss it!As for the sequels, Rocky 2 wasn't bad but 3, 4 and 5 were horrendous.",9,6,11,7 February 2002
Pretty Woman," Troubling...but I did like it
","Rich man Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) gets lost in CA looking for Beverly Hills. He asks directions from prostitute Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts). She quickly gets in the car with him, they get there...and he invites her to stay for the night. And slowly they (sigh) fall in love...SPOILERS!!! OK--on one hand this movie is pretty sick. All the prostitutes look like models--perfect health, clothes, teeth etc etc. Prostitution is shown as an OK lifestyle (that's how Roberts meets Gere) but just a little risky. Also everything looks perfect in this film--even the prostitutes apartment! It also ends with Roberts giving over herself to Gere totally. First of all is the implication that a woman NEEDS a man to survive and, second, she still is a prostitute--but just for him. That's a pretty disturbing message. The film plays lip service to occasionally telling us how horrible the career is--but everything they show is picture perfect. Also the film's R rating won't prevent kids from seeing it. I can imagine what they're gonna get from this. There's also a particularly sick sequence when Jason Alexander tries to rape her. THIS is a romantic comedy? END SPOILER!!!That aside I DID like the film. The script is sharp (Roberts pulls off some great lines), there's a great soundtrack and even the supporting cast works. The two best are Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo (nominated for a Golden Globe). Gere and Roberts are excellent--they're both attractive people and have a great chemistry together. This is a little too long and I find the ultimate message troubling (and kind of sick)...but I'd be lying if I said I hated it. A 6.",6,2,3,30 January 2007
The Descent," Very good
","Creepy eerie little horror film from England. It's about six women friends who decide to explore an unknown cavern that leads underground. While there that get trapped and find there is a race of cannibals down there too.That's about it for plot but this is still very good. We get to know and understand who the women are before they descend. Refreshingly they aren't all stereotypes--they are flawed but interesting human beings. Their dialogue is sometimes hard to understand (this was done in England and the accents are thick) but you can still figure things out. All the acting is excellent too.The descent down the cave is beautifully done--constantly being filmed from odd angles to keep the viewer off balance. Also we don't see anything more than the women see underground. They're surrounded by darkness and we're always expecting something to leap out. The film works beautifully in a dark theatre--it's like you're in the cave with them.The cannibals themselves don't pop up until an hour in--but it's worth the wait. The first views of them are downright terrifying (I yelled aloud at one) but then it doesn't work. For me they stopped being scary when we get good looks at them--they look like what they are which is guys in costume. Still the gore starts and it is STRONG. Blood flies and bodies are torn asunder. Most of the fights are shot in fast motion which, oddly, works. It all leads up to a silly ending. I know the American version has a different conclusion than the European version--we'll have to wait for the DVD to find out what it is probably.Still a good strong horror film. But DO NOT see it if you can't stand blood and gore--this is very strong stuff.",8,3,8,12 August 2006
Some Like It Hot," Just simply perfect comedy
","Two musicians--Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon)--accidentally witness a gangland murder set up by Spats Colombo (George Raft). They disguise themselves as women (Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne) and join an all girls band traveling to Florida. Also in the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and both the men fall madly in love with her.Classic comedy. I've seen it at least 10 times and I laugh out loud at it each time. It's fast-moving with a hilarious script. When I first saw this I was afraid there would be gay jokes made at the expense of Curtis and Lemmon. There isn't one! The script beautifully side steps any offensive material. Even when Curtis asks Lemmon, 'Why would a guy want to marry another guy' Lemmon says, 'Security!' The acting is mostly great. Curtis and Lemmon are just perfect and play off each other very well. Curtis actually looks pretty attractive as a woman! Monroe is just OK. She hated making this movie--she kept flubbing her lines and looks overweight (especially during her big musical number). Raft is pretty lousy--very stone-faced. But he's barely in the movie so it doesn't hurt things. It's filmed in black and white which actually helps--I think Lemmon and Curtis would have looked pretty awful in color as girls. So--a classic comedy with plenty of laughs and a famous last line--'Nobody's perfect'. Well worth seeing again and again. I give this a 10.",10,6,8,28 August 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Just incredible
","A bunch of British lads combine their money and enter a high stakes, illegal card game with a vicious criminal. They lose and must pay all the money within a week...or they lose their fingers--one for every day missed.That's just the beginning of an invigorating, fast-moving thriller. Double and triple-crosses abound. The thick British accents are hard to understand at first but you get used to it. This movie is full of TONS of extreme bloody violence (how this got an R I'll never know); loud, abrasive music that actually fit the scenes perfectly; virtual non-stop swearing and a fantastic script--full of hysterical lines and situations and always moving. Also director Guy Ritchie never stops--his camera and is always moving and he shots every scene in inventive ways. Basically it's a movie that you can't take yours eyes off--the direction and the script are so great you're always entertained. All the actors fit their roles perfectly too.This isn't for everybody--many people will probably find this too violent and profane for them. But, if you're game, you're gonna have fun! A 10 all the way. It's easy to see why it's among IMDb's top 250 films.Only debit--you're EXHAUSTED by the time the movie is over!",10,7,11,1 December 2004

","In 19th century France Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is constantly being chased by policeman Javery (Russell Crowe). Valjean promises poor Fantine (Anne Hathaway) that he'll take care of her daughter Cosette setting various complications into motion.I never liked the stage play so maybe that's why I hate the movie. The film is dark and depressing and you leave feeling bad. None of the songs are memorable. There's no life or spark to any of them. They're just there to move the story along. On the plus side Jackman and Hathaway are great and can really sing. Actually everyone can except for Crowe. He looks miserable, his acting is terrible and it was truly painful to hear him attempt to sing. The movie LOOKS good--great sets and costumes but I was bored silly. I looked at my watch more than once and actually dozed off a few times! Dark and dreary. Skip it.",1,9,19,14 January 2013

Then there's the psychotic raccoon Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) who steals some valuable batteries from a race and sets the whole world after them.The special effects are great, it moves quickly and there's plenty of action and eye-popping visuals. Also the script is clever. It's full of funny one-liners and Rocket and Baby Groot are hysterical. Still there are problems. It tends to shove family values and friends are great messages down your throat. Also Pratt isn't that good. He's tall, handsome and pumped up...but sort of a blank. Still I was entertained and recommend it.",8,5,9,20 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Long, but pretty good
","Adaptation of J.K. Rowling's very popular book is as good an adaptation as possible...but it doesn't completely work.The big problem was they were afraid to cut anything out of the book (they'd have school children all around the world after them), so they try to put everything in and there's too much for one movie.  Also it's a virtual word-by-word recitation of the book--if you've read the book, you've seen the movie.  This doesn't allow director Chris Columbus any leeway to change things or add his own personal stamp (not that Columbus was ever an inventive director to begin with).  So, it just ends up being the book visualized exactly as written.The acting is so-so.  The kids picked to play Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are pretty good--not great, but certainly not bad.  The adults vary wildly--Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker (love her yellow eyes!) are just great as teachers at Hogwats...Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are horrible...they're REALLY not enjoying themselves.  Also John Williams bombastic score is annoying.Still, it looks great, moves fairly quickly and there's a fantastic sequence showing a Quidditch game.  So, it's OK but nothing great.  Maybe if Spielberg had directed it...",7,2,5,6 December 2001
Thor," Better than I expected
","Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an arrogant and headstrong son of god Odin (Anthony Hopkins). His other son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) acts like he's the complete opposite of Thor. After a huge mistake Thor is stripped of his powers and sent to Earth. He's found there by a scientist studying the universe named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). She wants to help him but SHIELD (a secret government agency) wants him too.This movie is just a set-up to the Avengers movie that's going to come out in 2012 (in fact after the credits they say that Thor WILL return in The Avengers). For what it is (a comic book movie) it works. It's fast and full of action and violence (within a PG-13 rating of course). The script is kind of lame and totally predictable but I still liked it. It all leads up to an ending that basically screams to you that there WILL be a sequel.Surprisingly the acting in this is good. Portman is as good as she can be as Jane Foster and Hiddleston is excellent as Loki showing the evil beneath his exterior before it breaks free. Best of all is Hemsworth. He's young, incredibly handsome and in fantastic shape (he has one shirtless scene which is FUN to watch:)). Physical attributes aside he's very good in his role. He's not always dead serious and acts just like you would expect a god to act. The only debit was he occasionally used words and phrases that NO god would use--or know! Is this is a great movie? No. But it IS a good summer movie to kick back and enjoy. I give it an 8.",8,0,2,15 May 2011
Mystic River," Way overpraised
","Three childhood friends (Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon) are reunited in Boston (actually shot in Chelsea and East Boston) when Penn's daughter is murdered.  Robbins was molested as a boy and still shows the scars of it. On the night of the murder he arrives home covered with blood.  He tells his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) that he killed a mugger...but there's nothing in the paper the next few days.  Penn is desperate to find the killer and Bacon plays a member of the Boston police who (with partner Laurence Fishburne) tries to figure out what happened.This was wildly overpraised by critics.  Why?  Because it's VERY quiet, VERY slow and VERY long--too long.  Everything is done slowly and in almost complete silence...the effect on the audience is deadening.  When a few twists come in the final reel they carried no emotional impact--they're done in the same quiet way as the rest of the film.  Also, this easily could have been done in less than 2 hours--there's no reason for this film to ramble on for 2 hrs 15 min.  The only worthwhile things in the movie is seeing Boston on the big screen and the acting.  Everybody is great--Penn, Robbins, Fisburne and Laura Linney--Bacon and Harden (in difficult roles) are just superb with Bacon faking the Boston accent very well.This is basically a murder mystery that thinks WAY too much of itself.  If Clint Eastwood hadn't directed it with this powerhouse cast it would probably have been ignored.  Worth seeing for the beautiful Boston settings and the acting--but it's very slow and pretentious too.  I can only give it a 6.  One good thing--it's a sure cure for insomnia. :)",6,4,8,30 October 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," A classic
","George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) thinks he has a dreadful life. He runs a loan association in the small town of Bedford Falls.

One Christmas Eve he is on the verge of suicide until his guardian angel (Henry Travers) shows up to stop him. No other word for it--it's a classic! Hard to believe this was a bomb when it first came out...it's reputation didn't even start till the early 1980s with repeated television showings. Basically, there's nothing wrong with the film. The script is well-written with realistic well-drawn characters. What really makes it work is that the movie doesn't make Stewart a goody two shoes--he's really unhappy and mean in the first section of the film. It makes his 'transformation' at the end more believable and realistic. Also it's one of the few movies that has an ending that will have the entire audience crying--out of happiness. The acting is just great all across the board, the set design incredible (Bedford Falls was on a sound stage!) and is heart warming without getting too sentimental. I usually hate films like this but I've loved this since the first time I saw it and make it a point to see it every Christmas. A true classic. Highly recommended.",10,3,6,27 December 1999
A Beautiful Mind," Well-acted but dull
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**  True story about John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician, and his struggles with schizophrenia. Well-acted by Crowe, Jennifer Connelly (as his wife), Ed Harris (as a government agent) and Paul Bettany (as a college roommate) but dull dull dull!!!  It's needleslly long (over 2 hours), very slow and I had a hard time staying awake.  A few people walked out after about an hour--I wish I had joined them.  This movie purports to be a true story.  It isn't.  They make Nash into a saint-like character.  In real life he cheated on his wife (with women AND men), was addicted to drugs and divorced her.  All this is left out of the movie to make him more acceptable for mainstream audiences.  Basically though, they're lying.  They end up making his character boring.  Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth.  The film just moves at a turtle's pace with characters talking and talking and talking endlessly about boring subjects (the schizophrenia doesn't kick in until after an hour).  Only the acting is good.  Anyways, this film was made for only one reason--to win Oscars.  It has a very cold, calculated feel about it.  Everybody looks perfect, everything looks beautiful, there's a big lush musical score, the schizophrenia is presented tastefully--nothing to offend anybody.  That is the type of film that wins Oscars--sadly this cleaned up at the Golden Globes so the Oscars might happen.  It's just annoying that this movie says it's all about schizophrenia and trying to make the public aware of it, when it's actually all about winning awards and nothing more.    Predictable, boring and calculating.  Avoid.",5,17,32,4 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Very good but exhausting
","Who would have thought it?  Director Chris Columbus has actually made a very good film!This film follows Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts with a much darker tone than the first film.  However, the film should be dark--the books are.  This film is much better than the first.  The first had to spend a lot of time introducing Harry, his friends and Hogwarts.  This film assumes you know all about it and kicks right in.  It moves quickly and has better (and more) special effects.  Little time is spent on characters and motivations--whether that's good or bad depends on what you like.The acting has improved.  Daniel Radcliffes (Harry Potter) voice has noticably deepened and his acting has improved (a little).  Emma Watson (Hermione) has blossomed into a very pretty young girl and gives a very good performance.  Rupert Grint (Ron) is just OK--he's got to stop being so bug-eyed over everything.  Also Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and the (sadly) late Richard Harris offer strong support.  The only bad piece of casting was Kenneth Branaugh as a new teacher.  He's supposed to be funny yet sinister--he's neither--just boring and silly.The film is NOT for small children.  As I said before, it's dark and has some very scary moments (all of them involving giant, hungry spiders and vicious, huge snakes).  Also there's some fairly bloody violence (for a PG-13).The main problem is the films length--2 hours, 41 minutes.  It's long and there's a lot of action and story covered.  I was exhausted by the end of the movie (in a good way).So, it's a great roller coaster ride for older children and adults.",8,4,7,2 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Didn't really like it but Pitt and Jolie were great!
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) are unhappily married to each other. They think the other has a quiet respectable job...but they are actually hired assassins for opposing companies. Then they each get a job...to kill the other one. Did I mention this is supposed to be a comedy?The premise is a good one and it's played (relatively) straight...but this doesn't work completely. As an action movies it does succeed--there are tons of gunfights, some really incredible stunts and multiple explosions--typical turn off your mind summer movie fun. But as a comedy it doesn't work at all. For starters the lines just aren't that funny. It's also hard to laugh in a movie where at least a hundred people are shot to death or knifed (but there's no blood so I guess that makes it OK). The casual violence in this is STRONG and there's a fight between Pitt and Jolie that I found way too violent to be amusing. There is one funny bit--when a prisoner is being questioned he's wearing a 'Fight Club' T shirt.On the plus side Pitt and Jolie are just great. Who knew they could do comedy so well? The lines are lousy but they give them their all. Also they work VERY well together and there's a great chemistry between them. Also they're both very physically attractive. They make to movie bearable. Vince Vaughn and Adam Brody are in supporting roles but given nothing to do.So I'd love to see Pitt and Jolie together again--in a better movie. I give this a 7--mostly for them.",7,4,9,23 June 2005
The Departed," Very good but not Scorseses' best
","Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control.OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to 'Raging Bull' and 'Good Fellas'. However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word 'f***' is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it).It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8.",8,6,10,2 June 2008
Die Hard," One of the best action films of all time
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) a NYC cop is in California on Christmas Eve to see his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and their kids. He attends a party at her company's lavish high-rise. The party is attacked and held hostage by a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). McClane escapes but what can he do alone against a large group of terrorists?Full of action, excitement, incredible stunts and tons of gunfights and fistfights. When you think about it the plot it's highly improbable but once the action kicks in you won't care. I saw this opening weekend when it came out in 1988. In first run theatres the Dolby stereo was turned up as loud as it could go. There were LOTS of gunfights and explosions in deafening stereo sound. It was GREAT! There's also great acting by Willis, Bedelia and Rickman. TONS of swearing too. A GREAT action flick. Highly recommended :)",10,3,4,28 December 2017
Psycho," Very good...but not Hitchcock's masterpiece
","Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) leaves town with money that isn't hers. She's driving to see her boyfriend (John Gavin) and run away with him. She stops overnight at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his cranky unseen mother...I don't deny that this movie is masterfully done by Alfred Hitchcock--the direction here is incredible. The justly famous shower scene and the murder of Arbogast are still shocking. The music score by Bernard Herrmann fits the film perfectly too. It's all well-done...but I'm not crazy (sorry) about it. Maybe it's because of my first time seeing it. I saw it in third grade on late night TV. The shower scene was completely cut out as was the explanation at the end! I was totally lost. So I thought it was a stupid, pointless movie. It's neither of course but first impressions are hard to ignore.This is one of Hitchcock's true horror films. It was made in black and white on a low budget with a crew taken from Hitchcock's TV show. Also most of the cast took a cut in pay just to work with him. No one thought this would work but it's now considered a classic. I like it a lot but I find some of the acting stiff (Vera Miles and John Gavin especially) and some boring sequences. Let's face it--we all know Norman is his mother so that sort of lessens the movie. Leigh is good in her role and Perkins is just incredible in his. He rightfully plays Bates as a shy awkward little boy--but you see the madness lurking inside him. A truly great performance that came far too soon for Perkins and (sadly) destroyed his career. It's worth seeing of course but I consider 'Rope' or 'North by Northwest' as being much better films. Ignore the stupid R rating this still carries--it would get a PG-13 today. Recommended.'We all go a little mad sometimes.' 'My mother...isn't quite herself today.'",8,3,7,23 February 2008
Rosemary's Baby," Hated it the first time, loved it the second time
","Married couple Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes) move into the beautiful Bramford apartment building (the Dakota was used). They meet nice but pushy neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer). Then Rosemary gets pregnant...and her life becomes a nightmare. She thinks the neighbors are witches and want her baby. Is that true or is it her imagination? Now classic horror film. I first caught this at a revival theatre when I was in college. I thought it was too long and dull with terrible acting. I should mention I had just read the book this was based on. Seeing it again (over 20 years later) my opinion has totally changed. I still think it's too long and Farrow's acting wavers (sometimes she just great, other times she's too mannered) but this time I was fascinated and the ending actually scared me silly! The setting is beautiful--the Dakota is a huge building in NY with very exclusive tenants...but it looks downright terrifying here (I have to credit director Roman Polanski for that). Inside the apartments are huge but spooky. When Rosemary and Guy hear chanting through the walls on their first night or so there it's actually pretty chilling. The scene where Rosemary gets pregnant is pretty hard to watch too. Acting, as I mentioned, wavers. Farrow is really off sometimes and Cassavetes looks miserable (I believe he later said he did it for the money) but Gordon (in her Oscar-winning role) and Blackmer are just great. Also Maurice Evans, Charles Grodin, Elisha Cook and Ralph Bellamey are strong in supporting roles. And listen for the voice of Tony Curtis in one sequence. There's also some funny black humor here--at one point Rosemary is in a doctors office. She picks up a 'Time' magazine and the cover says, 'Is God Dead'? Scary, well-made horror film. Decidedly NOT for pregnant women. I give it an 8.'What have you done to him you maniacs?'",8,2,3,16 June 2008
Jersey Boys," Well-done but where's the color?
",Story of the rise (and fall) of the 60s group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.I saw the play this was based on and hated it. The songs were great but the dramatics were obvious and (frankly) quite boring. The movie doesn't change the play at all--it's almost a word by word copy. However I did like the movie a lot. For some reason the cornball dramatics actually worked better on screen than on stage. Usually it's the opposite. Also (with one exception) all the acting was great--especially John Lloyd Young as Valli (which he won a Tony Award for back in 2006). However there are two glaring problems here. One is Christopher Walken. He plays a gangster here who helps the boys. He's TERRIBLE! He looks bad and he gives a lousy performance. The other is the color--or lack of it! For whatever reason director Clint Eastwood shot the film in muted color. Bad decision. This is a MUSICAL--not some gritty drama. The bad color really weakens the film and makes the actors look like ghosts. And what's with all the swearing? The play had next to no swearing at all. However when they're on stage singing all is forgiven. I give a 7. Stronger color might have boosted my rating.,7,1,9,30 June 2014
War of the Worlds," Boy was this DULL
","Unnecessary remake of the 1953 sc-fi classic.PLOT SPOILER AHEAD! Aliens invade Earth but this time they're already INSIDE the Earth. It seems they planted their machines in there when Earth was uninhabited...and decided to attack later. That's just STUPID! Why not just colonize the planet BEFORE it was inhabited---why wait till later? That makes no sense. PLOT SPOILER END!The main plot has Tom Cruise as a divorced father of 2. He's trying to get his two kids back to their mother who's visiting Boston. He has to get them from NJ to MA with aliens attacking.I don't like Spielberg and I HATE Cruise--but I thought this might work. They did another sci-fi movie a few years ago (Minority Report) which wasn't bad. Well--THIS is bad! Yeah the special effects are great--but I've seen all this before. I'm bored silly with perfect looking CGI effects. They don't thrill me anymore--I need a story too.Unfortunately this is a predictable, Spielberg type heart warming story (actually my heart didn't warm but my stomach lurched!). I've seen these characters before. Acting doesn't help. Cruise is just OK in the lead. His son was lousy. Only incredible little Dakota Fanning gave out a GREAT performance. She's only 11 and she can out act Tom Cruise (no big feat I admit). Tim Robbins pops up adding nothing to the story. And Morgan Freeman narrates in an eerie fashion.Frankly I was bored and looking at my watch constantly. It all leads up to a happy conclusion that had me gasping (in disbelief). The ending is SO stupid!!!! If I hadn't disliked the film before THAT would have done it for me! I give this a 5--only for Dakota Fanning. Otherwise this is boring and pointless. Stick with the original. Gene Barry from the original does a (very) brief appearance here at the end.",5,4,12,9 July 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," Still works after over 70 years!
","A bunch of young enthusiastic German schoolboys volunteer for WWI believing it to be a noble and fun thing to do for their country. They quickly find out that war is a living hell.One of the first (and best) anti-war films ever made. It has problems--the sound recording is not that good and the acting is bad--the guys are either overacting or pretty wooden and there is some howlingly bad dialogue. But it still works.Lewis Milestones' direction helps. The battle scenes are long, vicious and pretty graphic (for 1930) and he really makes you feel all the pain and agony the soldiers endure. There are many unforgettable scenes: a young man, his eyes shot out, screaming and stumbling in a battlefield; a young soldier trapped in a crater with a corpse of the enemy; the sequence where the soldiers are being driven mad by nonstop bombing from the enemy and a final scene that packs a real wallop.It's also interesting to see flashes of male nudity (this was pre-Code) and Lew Ayres so young and full of life. It's hard to believe such an old film can still work so strongly but this does. I can imagine the impact this had in 1930.See the full 130 minute version...avoid the edited 105 minute one. Good luck finding a clear print with good sound.",10,3,4,28 May 2002
Love Actually," Light but very VERY sweet
","A bunch of love stories that occur in December in London and all fall together on Christmas Eve.  Bill Nighy plays a has-been rock star who rerecords one of his old hits as a Christmas songs.  He's drugged out, beaten down and very very funny--and has no one to love.  Hugh Grant plays the prime minister who falls for his assistant (the wonderful Martine McCutcheon).  Colin Firth plays a man who just left his cheating wife and falls for a lovely Italian girl (Lucia Moniz) who really doesn't speak English.  Alan Rickman plays an executive married to loving wife Emma Thompson and pursued by his sexy secretary Heike Makatsch.  Kris Marshall plays a geeky English guy who flies all the way to America believing his accent will make him a stud.  Laura Linney plays a secretary deeply (and understandingly) in love with hunky Rodrigo Santoro--but she has somebody else.  Andrew Lincoln is secretly in love with his best friend's wife.  Liam Neeson coaches his 11 year old stepson on how to get a girl.  AND a guy falls for a woman while doing stand ins with her on a porno set.As you can see, there's plenty of material--too much.  The film is overlong--but all the actors are just great (Thomson, Rickman, Grant, Linney and Firth are just unbelievable) and the film is bright, colorful and--just like real life--doesn't have all happy endings.  Still, I loved every minute of this and recommend it highly.One warning--this is VERY R rated.  The language is rough and there's plenty of casual nudity in the porn sketch.",10,1,8,30 November 2003
30 Days of Night," Has its moments--but not enough
","Film about a town in Alaska which, once a year, has only night for a full month. A bunch of vampires appear from nowhere (it's never made clear but it's suggested they came from overseas) and begin to slaughter the residents. A small bunch escape led by Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett). But the power is cut off, all the sled dogs have been killed, the cell phones destroyed and Oleson and others have to spend a whole month hiding and trying to survive from the vampires.This movie does have a lot of good things going for it. The basic plot (based on a graphic novel) is not bad. The vampires themselves are impressive--vicious evil creatures who can move VERY fast. Danny Huston chews the scenery as the head vampire and they all speak in an eerie foreign language (the audience gets subtitles). The acting is pretty good with one exception and most of the attack scenes are fast, vicious and VERY gory. Still I didn't like it.First of all--Hartnett. I've never liked him and this movie does nothing to change my mind--he's a terrible actor. He's the lead so it's a big liability. After the basic plot is set up everything goes by the numbers. You know who's going to live, who's going to die and the horrible predictable 'dramatic' dialogue is just dull. Also the opening attack on the town is just so badly done it boggles the mind. It looks like it was edited by someone with extreme ADD! Things are going so fast and quick it's impossible to tell what's going on! The attack sequences that follow are better handled. Things do get a little better during the last half hour, but by then I was bored to tears by the horrible dialogue and cardboard characters. I only stayed in my seat because Huston was so much fun. He's having a great time in the role and it rubs off on the audience. Still, he isn't enough to save the movie. I give it a 6.",6,4,8,2 November 2007
Wedding Crashers," Just filthy...and hysterical
","Two immature men--John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Gray (Vince Vaughn)--'crash' weddings. They go to weddings uninvited, pretend they're part of the family--and proceed to bed as many women as possible. Then they crash the wedding of the Cleary family. Beckwith falls in love with Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) but she has a real jerk of a boyfriend (Bradley Cooper) who is insanely jealous.Typical plot but it works! This film is a throwback to the adult comedies of the 1970s. It wears its R rating proudly and proceeds to throw as many sex jokes at you as possible (with the expected female nudity). The thing is all the jokes are funny! The cast is attractive, spirited and ready to go and give their all to this. Yes it's silly, VERY raunchy and predictable--but I loved it.Vaughn and Wilson are just great--they play off each other well and are GREAT at comedy. McAdams is beautiful and very good. Cooper is easily one of the most hateful villains I've ever seen in a comedy. Christopher Walken walks around in a daze (as usual) but isn't bad. Even Jane Seymour pops up and it's astonishing to see her talking dirty--but very funny too.Only a few minor complaints--there are plenty of dead spots in this picture--TOO many. Also it comes to a screeching halt when it gets serious. It also allows its main characters to be abused WAY too much. Vaughn and Wilson are repeatedly beaten by Cooper--I didn't find that funny--it got too violent. Wilson and Vaughn are jerks but we don't need to see them get beaten up like they do.So it IS a dirty movie so it's not for everybody (keep the kids AWAY from this one) but it is funny for those who are game. I give it an 8. It's a huge hit so let's hope there are more adult comedies coming out!",8,2,4,27 August 2005
Burlesque," Was it good? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes:)
","Obvious story of beautiful talented singer Ali (Christina Aguilera) moving from Iowa to Los Angeles to find fame and fortune. She (almost immediately) finds a job as a bartender in a bar called Berlesque Lounge run by Tess (Cher). She quickly becomes a top singer in the bar and is romanced by hot hunky roommate Jack (Cam Gigandet) and rich Marcus (Eric Dane). Totally obvious complications follow. It leads to an ending with EVERYBODY happy--and had me smirking at the screen:)OK--this is a terrible movie--there's no two ways about it. The plot is ridiculously obvious and topped by truly horrendous dialogue. There's also incredible leaps of logic--Jack is as bartender but then we see him playing piano in the band. He can do both at once??? Also Ali's rise to fame is ridiculously fast. The acting is terrible. Gigandet is a good actor--but you'd never know it from this. However the guy has NOTHING to work with. His brief nude scene is nice though:) Aguilera can sing and dance--but can't act. Some of her attempts at acting were embarrassing. Cher seems unable to move a muscle in her face. I love her but she's had TOO many face lifts! Alan Cumming,Peter Gallagher and hunky Eric Dane were shamefully underused in small roles.On the up side--the singing and dancing (and there was a LOT of both) were great! The songs were good and the dancers (male and female) were good-looking and full of energy. The last number is a true show stopper. Stanley Tucci is GREAT as the gay club manager. He easily throws off one liners in a hilarious manner. And also Gigandet is ridiculously attractive (and blows equally hot Dane off the screen). And, best of all, the dance numbers weren't edited by somebody who is ADD addicted. The camera actually stands still a few times and you can SEE the dances.So--is it good? No...but I had a fun time watching it. The singing and dancing WAS incredible. I give it a 7 for that alone...and Gigandet:)",7,0,3,9 December 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," I wasn't impressed
","Supposedly based on a true incident this is a story of a group of British POWs forced to build a bridge for the Japanese during WWII. The prisoners are led by Alec Guinness (winning a well-deserved Oscar) who keeps butting heads with the Japanese commander (Sessue Hayakawa). Meanwhile another group of British and Americans (one played by William Holden) will do anything to blow up the bridge.The popularity of this film completely escapes me. It's much too long--the script really drags everything out--this could have been done in half the time. I was actually falling asleep a few times and looking at my watch constantly. Also, Hayakawa's thick accent makes 90% of his dialogue unintelligable and his performance is pretty bad. And the ending is a washout--it contains bad special effects and it doesn't carry any impact at all.On the good side--Holden and Guinness give out very good performances, there is some admittedly beautiful scenes (director David Lean did know how to shoot epics), the whistling song has become a classic and there's a wonderful dinner scene between Guinness and Hayakawa. For all those things I'm giving this a 5.But overall, I found this a big, bloated, boring movie. I can't recommend it.",5,9,24,1 April 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Irresistible
","A 'typical' day in the life of the Beatles. They have to deal with Paul's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a neurotic TV director (Victor Spinetti), their long-suffering managers and tons of screaming fans.No real plot, just a lot of very lively sequences overflowing with one-liners and non sequiturs. The tone of the scenes go all over the place--one is full of verbal puns, the next visual gags, then absurdity reigns, THEN surrealism! It's a credit to director Richard Lester that he manages to keep all these various shifts in tone flowing smoothly. It's great to see that the Beatles are obviously enjoying themselves every minute. Some of the jokes are obscure (the 'clean' jokes were based on remarks made about the Beatles back in 1962) and the accents are sometimes difficult. But it's great to see the Beatles so young and full of life and when they sing the film becomes magical. Also they have a good cast backing them up--Brambell and Spinetti are just great (and very funny). If you don't like the Beatles or their music, you might want to skip this film. But if you do, it's a must-see.",10,35,45,19 December 2000
The Wolf of Wall Street," A very good Martin Scorsese film
",Movie based on the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). He was a poor man who joined Wall Street in the late 1980s. He slowly built his way up to the top--making his own company and doing anything (legal or illegal) to come out on top. He also became addicted to drugs and sex and it slowly destroys him.A VERY good but not great Scorsese film. Let's get the negatives out of the way first--it's far too long at 3 hours (this could easily have lost 30 minutes); Jonah Hill is TERRIBLE and annoying in a supporting role; the constant swearing and screaming gets tiresome; there's WAY too much female nudity (while a scene with male nudity was cut down to nothing) and there's no real ending...it just sort of stops. Still I loved it a lot more than I hated it. The acting was great by everybody (save Hill). DiCaprio was brilliant in the title role. Who knew he could do comedy as well as drama? He anchors this film and he's never less than mesmerizing. As I said mostly everybody else is good but special mention must be made for Margot Robbie (as his second wife Naomi) and Joanna Lumley who is incredible as Aunt Emma. The story moves fairly quickly and there's a great use of period music. So this is excellent but not great Scorsese.,9,7,12,9 February 2014
Army of Darkness," Love the first two but don't like this
",This is a review of the 96 min. directors cut. Basically this is 'Evil Dead 3'. It picks up right were 'Evil Dead 2' left off with Ash (Bruce Campbell) back in medieval times. He wants to get back to present day (1992) but has to get a book that holds the incantation and battle the evil dead.Unlike the first time this is R rated--the first 2 were unrated but would have gotten an NC-17 easily. Also unlike the first two the accent here is on humor not horror and the gore is significantly toned down. Also the plot in this one is all over the place. It's fairly simple but Ash is constantly insulting everyone and telling bad jokes. Also it comes to a dead halt sometimes to indulge in some VERY violent (and unfunny) slapstick. The sequence in the windmill and when Ash first encounters the skeletons seem to come from a Three Stooges short! I hate the Three Stooges and I don't think I have to sit through TWO of their routines while watching a horror movie! On the plus side director Raimi had a LOT of money for this one and the special effects are dazzling. The stop-motion skeletons were just a joy to watch. Also Campbell's WAY over the top acting helps the story speed through its dull spots and Embeth Davidtz is very attractive and convincing as the love interest. Also the studio cut has a silly ending (with Bridget Fonda) but the directors cut has a more serious (and better) ending. This one just left me cold while I loved the first two so I can only give it a 5. The slapstick humor and stupid comedic lines were totally out of place in an Evil Dead film.,5,1,8,3 October 2009
Scream 2," Incredible sequel
","This is a rarity--a sequel that doesn't suck! This takes place a few years after 'Scream'. Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in college still recovering from virtually all her friends being killed years before. Then a movie called 'Stab' opens that is a fictional account of what happened. Then the murders start happening again centered around Sidney. GREAT sequel with a wonderful script, mostly great acting and plenty of action. The body count has been upped, the killings are more brutal and bloody and this film is very scary. There is humor of course but it takes a back seat to horror. Well-directed by Wes Craven too. There's only two problems. One is David Arquette. He's TERRIBLE in his role. He appears drugged out. The second is the killer seems to magically teleport himself to where his victims are. This happens at least three times in the course of the film! Still, if you're a horror film like me, you learn how to totally suspend your disbelief and go with it. A fast, funny and bloody sequel. Avoid 'Scream 3' at all costs.",10,3,5,25 October 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Probably the worst Dracula ever
","Dracula (Gary Oldman) attacks London.OK-there are so many things wrong with this film it's hard to know where to start. First off--the title. 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. Oh really? I've read the book multiple times--this is NOT the book at all. Just the opening with how Dracula became wasn't from the book at all. It gets worse when they switch to 1897 London...and you see Jonathan Harker is played by Keanu Reeves! We all know Reeves can't act but seeing him trying to imitate an English accent was just jaw-dropping. He was TERRIBLE! He goes to Dracula's castle to help him move to London. There we met Oldman in terrible makeup giving one of his worst performances. He also seems to be wearing Japanese robes (for some reason). And he looks ugly--Dracula is supposed to be handsome. Also the shadows in the castle don't move with the people (???). It all leads to a stupid scene full of pointless female nudity where three female vampires attack Reeves. Reeves pretty much disappears after that (this is a good thing).We cut to London--Dracula comes aboard. Mina (Winona Ryder) is watching for Jonathan, her boyfriend. With her is her good friend Lucy (Sadie Frost). She behaves like a nymphomaniac--not in the book. Also there's a huge rainstorm when Mina and Lucy run around giggling and end up kissing. WHY? It leads to nothing and isn't in the book either. Then Dracula shows up, turns into a wolf man (???), lures Lucy out of her bed and rapes her (????) on top of a tombstone. Bites her too. Then Mina shows up and she is (sigh) the reincarnation of Dracula's dead wife. OK--that is the oldest, stupidest cliché in horror films and, again, not in the book.Lucy starts to slowly die--poor Frost has to wither around in bed with her breasts constantly being exposed. Her boyfriend (Cary Elwes) and suitors stand around and watch--they're given nothing to do. Also Dr. Seward (Richard E. Grant) pops up too and--for no reason--he's shown as a drug addict. Why? Again--not in the book. Then Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called in. He realizes what's happening. Lucy dies (after being raped by a wolf) and returns as a vampire (one of the few effective sequences). Of course she vomits blood on Van Helsing--for no reason other than to gross out the audience. She's killed (again) and Dracula starts romancing Mina in some truly boring sequences that drag on forever.It all leads up with the guys trying to get Dracula away from Mina and kill him. And the very end is (again) changed completely.OK--let's deal with the acting. Oldman--just dreadful. He's a good actor but not here. Let's put it this way--when somebody mentions cinematic Dracula do you think of Oldman? Ryder was actually very good but, purportedly, her and Oldman hated each other--it comes through loud and clear. Poor Frost is forced to be topless a lot and act sex-starved--she DOES pull it off however. Reeves--just the worst here--and that's saying a lot. Hopkins--what the HELL was he playing? He's acting like he's in a comedy--not a horror movie. Elwes and Campbell are given nothing to do. Grant is just OVER OVER the top (and annoying). Tom Waits is forgettable as Reinfield.The movie is chockful of visual tricks and stunning color--but it did nothing for me. It was nonstop and I got the impression that director Francis Ford Coppola was just showing off. Also it got tremendously annoying--I almost turned it off a few times. The special effects ARE good however (except for the stupid green mist that seduces Mina--don't ask). Also the music score is loud and overbearing. And what was with the costumes? An Asian man did them and Dracula seems dressed as he just popped in from China! Perhaps the gentleman should have been told Dracula is from Transylvania NOT China. I don't blame him though--Coppola probably told him to do that to add more color to the film.The script was hopeless--constantly straying from the novel. The title should be 'Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula' or 'James Harts' Dracula' (he was the screenwriter). Also--it wasn't scary at all. Not even a little (but Frost ALMOST makes it work in her vampire getup). My main problem is this tripe about Mina being Dracula's long-lost love (or something). Crap like that was clichéd back in the 1940s--it's almost insulting that this was stuck into a 1990s movie.This was a huge hit in 1992 (most likely cause it was advertised nonstop and Coppola did it) but now it's, rightfully, almost forgotten. A textbook example of how NOT to do a vampire film. I can't stress enough how horrible this truly is. A 1.",1,16,29,29 July 2005
"Hail, Caesar!"," Doesn't work as comedy or satire
","This takes place at the fictitious Capital Studios in Hollywood in the 1950s. A studio fixer (Josh Brolin) has his hands full. Their main star Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped, cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) has been cast in a serious drama and is driving his director (Ralph Fiennes) crazy, actress DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is pregnant...and not married and communists appear to be trying to take over.This movie is all over the place. I'm still not sure if it's meant to be a comedy or a satire. As a comedy it fails. A few of the lines are good but the humor is more clever than funny. As a satire it also fails. It's not biting enough to succeed. On the plus side it LOOKS good. The colors are strong and bright and the 1950s are recreated perfectly. All the acting is good too--especially by Brolin. There's also a long song and dance number that stops the movie. It has Channing Tatum and a bunch of guys dressed as sailors tap-dancing and singing (badly) and dancing. It's also VERY homoerotic. It has nothing to do with anything else in the movie but I'm not going to complain. All in all I didn't hate the movie but I spent the whole running time trying to get a grasp on what exactly this film was trying to accomplish.",5,9,13,22 February 2016
The Green Mile," YAWN!!!!
","This film (a numbing 3 hours and 10 minutes) has got to be one of the WORST film of 1999.  Yeah, it looks beautiful, the acting is very good, interesting special effects...BUT the movie is thuddingly obvious, subtlety goes out the window early on, and the film stretches out EVERY SINGLE SCENE for no point!  SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  WE get that the black prisoner is a savior (or something) early on--does it have to be proven FOUR times?  What's the point of Mr. Jingles being in the movie--other than being killed and brought back to life?  And really the initials of the guy (John Coffey--JC--get it?) was SO obvious it got annoying.  It's also mentioned at least 5 times. Ending was pointless and stupid and the movie was just plain DULL!!  This movie needs severe editing.  A big waste of time and talent.",4,6,16,21 December 1999
The Reader," Very well-acted but slow, depressing and pointless
","This is about a 15 year old German boy named Michael Berg (David Kross) who,in 1958, starts an affair with a woman named Hanna (Kate Winslet) who is old enough to be his mother. They lose touch and it jumps to 1966 where he is studying law. He discovers Hanna is on trial for being an SS guard at concentration camps. He's destroyed and this leads to discussions on who is guilty and who isn't. She's sentenced to life in jail. Then it jumps to 1980 where Michael is now played by Ralph Fiennes. For no discernible reason that I could see he gets in touch with Hanna. Then the movie slows to a crawl and just drags out the last half hour.OK--the acting is superb. I can see why Winslet won the Oscar for this (even though I found her better in 'Revolutionary Road') and Fiennes is just great but this movie is slow, dreary and ultimately pointless. The nude sex scenes between Winslet and Kross are about as unerotic as you could get and their relationship just doesn't make sense. The trial scenes in 1966 are interesting but the discussions on guilt and who is guilty go on endlessly and get repetitious quickly. After 90 minutes I thought the movie was over but we get another 34 minutes that is deadly dull and completely pointless. This is one of those movies that has 'We're trying to win an Oscar' written all over it. It's slow and somber and full of weighty issues--but that DOESN'T make it a good movie. If it were interesting I would have no problem but it isn't. The movie makers seem more interested in the nude sex scenes between Kross and Winslet than anything else. A boring and depressing movie. It gets a 2 for Winslet and Fiennes alone.",2,8,18,10 March 2010
Jaws," One of the best thrillers ever made
","A great white shark is attacking people on the waters surrounding Amity Island. Police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) is dead set against it. Then the attacks continue and Brody, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) go after it.I remember seeing this in a theatre back when I was 13. It was a HUGE hit when it came out. It came out in the summer and the PG rating (with a severe warning saying the shark attacks might be too brutal for younger viewers) had kids pushing to see it. Back then this was pretty gruesome stuff. The attack scenes are bloody and there's a scene where you see a man get eaten...and it's not pretty. Back then this scared me silly. It doesn't scare me that much now but it's still a great thriller.Director Steven Spielberg shot it in beautiful Martha's Vineyard (right here in MA) and perfectly caught the feel of a summer community. Also the film is always moving with overlapping dialogue and the editing zipping the film along (it deserved the editing Oscar it won). Also the acting is great--Scheider is perfectly cast as Brody; Dreyfuss hit it big with his performance here and Shaw is just great in one of his last performances before (sadly) alcoholism killed him. There's also strong support from Lorraine Gary (as Brody's wife) and Hamilton as the mayor. A rare case when a lousy book (by Peter Benchley) became a great movie. And there's John Williams Oscar-winning now classic score in here.It's incredible how Spielberg got such a great movie--everything went wrong! The weather never agreed with them and they had hellish problems with the mechanical shark (which kept malfunctioning). And Shaw's drinking held up production also.Basically this is a top thriller which still holds up almost 30 years later.A must-see!",10,3,9,10 September 2004
Dark Shadows," Not the disaster it could have been
","Redo of the classic TV soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971. In the 1700s Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed in becoming a vampire by the evil witch Angelique (Eva Green). He's then chained into a coffin and buried. Almsot 200 years later (in 1972) his coffin is dug up and he is released. He finds the Collins family lives in a crumbling estate and is HEAVILY dysfunctional. He decides to bring the family and mansion back to life...but (somehow) Angelique is still around and will do anything to stop him.I was expecting the worst from this film. I have fond memories of running home from grammar school to catch this on TV (it played at 3:30) and having it scare me silly. There was even a theatrical 1970 film called 'House of Dark Shadows' which REALLY poured on the blood and violence...and got by with a PG rating! 'Night of Dark Shadows' is best left forgotten. It seems director Tim Burton and star Depp are Dark Shadows fans and were going to turn this into a comedy. Well there IS humor in it but there's also violence and a very creepy atmosphere. The film LOOKS great--but all Tim Burton films do. They caught the early 1970s fads and fashions beautifully. Love the music (opens right up with 'Nights in White Satin') and Danny Elfman cleverly works in music from the original series into his score. They also have a wonderful cast--Depp is just great as Barnabas; Michelle Pfeiffer is given little to do but looks great as Elizabeth Collins; Eva Green is a very sexy (and deadly) Angelique; Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper (!!!) have small parts and Helena Bonham Carter is hysterical as Dr. Julia Hoffman. Also original cast members Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby have an amusing cameo at a party. So it looks great but really drops the ball with plot.The plot is taken from the series (Angelique loving and cursing Barnabas) but leaves WAY too many things unexplained. Angelique is STILL around after 200 years? How and why? How do the Collins family live with their factory closed down for years? What's with all the jewelry and paintings hidden under the fireplace? Too many questions. Also the last half hour goes barreling out of control. It's non-stop CGI with some truly bizarre plot twists. SPOILER!!! Carolyn is revealed to be a werewolf! Really???? I mean WTF? It comes out of nowhere and is not needed. And, all of the sudden, David's dead mother pops up to take revenge??? Why wait all this time? It's like the writers gave up and threw everything they could dream up on the screen and hoped it would work. END SPOILER. BTW--they leave room for a SEQUEL! Still I was never bored and it DID work. So--it could have been worse. I give it a 7.",7,2,6,14 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good thing this is the last one!
","This shows how Anakin Skywalker (Haydn Christensen) became Dath Vader with all political intrigues and such. The film will be incomprehensible if you haven't seen Episodes 1 and 2.All right--I'm not a Star Wars fan. I'm not much into science fiction at all. Still I don't think that's the reason I'm giving this film a 5. All the good reviews of this are beyond me. Yes, the special effects are amazing...but I need more than that for me to enjoy a movie. I need a good script and characters I care about to enjoy it. Unfortunately George Lucas wrote this and he once again shows that he couldn't write to save his life. The dialogue is just impossibly bad--pure drivel. All the characters talk like they're idiots. The romantic interludes between Christensen and his wife (Natalie Portman) had my audience laughing. They are truly hysterically bad--I give Portman and Christensen credit for saying those lines with straight faces. After a while I got mad at the movie--I felt like it was talking down to me and assumed I was in idiot. Everything is broken down to the level of a bad sci-fi comic book.As for the acting...let's put it this way--Yoda (a CGI creation) gives the best performance! I'm not joking--the acting is that bad! Christensen was just hopeless in the lead--he makes one long for Jake Lloyd! His attempts to show the Dark Side in his face were just pathetic. Portman tries (too hard) to give a good performance but the dialogue defeats her. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson walk through their roles in a daze--I NEVER thought I would see those two great actors give bad performances! Ian McDiarmid ALMOST gives a good performance as Chancellor Palpatine---almost. As for Yoda--he's great. One terrific moment has him casually waving his hand and knocking two guys flat. I really can't believe I'm giving a CGI creation top acting honors...but I am.I was mostly bored to death and looking at my watch more than a few times. I'm really surprised that this is in IMDb's top 250 movies.Also you might want to keep small kids away from this film. One child is killed on screen and it's made clear (twice) that a bunch of them had been murdered.I know I'm in the minority but I can only give this a 5.",5,25,49,5 June 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Animation aside this is sexist and dull
","Wat Disney's first full-length animated cartoon was a HUGE hit in 1937. I saw it when I turned 5 in 1967 (I was told) and LOVED it. I saw it again 7 years later (back then Disney films were reissued every 7 years at theatres) and was bored silly. Just saw the digitally restored version on DVD. It LOOKS incredible with bright colors and beautiful animation but I still don't like it.The story is sssloooowwww and the character of Snow White is given NO characterization at all! She's just SO sweet and SO innocent that you just want to hit her. The Prince barely figures in this. The music and songs were terrible! 'Whistle While You Work' and 'Someday My Prince Will Come' were (kind of) cute but way too sweet. Also they're sung at such a high pitch they could break glass! The dwarfs are annoying and obnoxious and act like a gang of badly behaved children. Their 'comical' antics were anything but. Only the animals come across as nice. Also the sexism is horrific. Snow eagerly agrees to keep house for the dwarfs for no good reason whatsoever. Yet when the Prince awakens her she has no problem running off with him to be 'happily' married! I realize this was made over 70 years ago for kids but that doesn't excuse it. I acknowledge the film does have an important place in film history but I found it slow, stupid and boring. I can only give this a 3.",3,5,30,18 April 2011
Bring It On," Fun, silly movie
","OK, it has its boring spots and not all the comedy works, but this movie about cheerleading competition is usually very enjoyable.  The acting in uniformly good (especially Dunst) and the movie doesn't take itself seriously once (really, how could it?).  As for all those comments about how this isn't a work of art and makes fat girls feel worthless--come on!  It's just a silly teenage comedy!  This has NO pretensions to be a work of art and anyone who takes it as a serious message movie should have their head examined.  Also the guys are cute in the movie and it's pretty gay positive. My only complaint--couldn't the guys have taken their shirts off just once? God knows there are tons of scenes with the girls scampering around with next to nothing on (all within PG-13 limits though).",7,0,0,8 September 2000
Inception," Stupid, dull and frustrating
","A mess about 'mind pirates'...or something. They enter peoples minds, bend reality and are hired to help a man to change his dying fathers mind to get control of his estate...but there are OTHER people who are trying to stop them.Wow! What a total disaster! This is one of those movies that make so little sense that people just assume they're not intelligent enough to 'get it' and fall all over themselves praising it. This movie is not some revolutionary trend setter--does anyone remember 'The Matrix' from 20 year ago? Also it sets up the rules of what's going on at the beginning. That's fine but they're thrown at you so fast and furious (with NO explanation) that I was totally lost. Then, after establishing the rules, they CHANGE them for no other reason than to confuse the plot and throw viewers off. THEN they introduce new rules when we're well into the movie! That's not clever or intriguing--it's playing with the viewers mind and deliberately making them lost and confused. To make it worse the acting pretty much sucks. Ellen Page is horrendous (and her character is never fully introduced or explained) and Joseph Godron-Levitt sleepwalks through his role. DiCaprio (who I THOUGHT was a good actor) is terrible. He gives yet another performance of a man who's tortured by some dark past and trying to get through it. He's done this many times before ('Revolutionary Road', 'Shutter Island'). Can't he do anything else? Also when he breaks loose and start yelling I didn't believe it for one second and I couldn't take it seriously. I've seen that before! The admittedly great special effects can't help. I walked out after 90 minutes. The movie is constantly pulling the rug out from under the viewers and I got this smug attitude that the filmmakers were having a fun time playing with the viewers and thinking they were smarter than they actually were. Dull, annoying and very full of itself. Don't bother.",1,51,103,25 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Good but a little dull
",In 1934 a train (the Orient Express) is traveling from Istanbul. Aboard is an all-star cast including Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who is trying to relax. However an avalanche leaves the train stranded for a few days. In that time a passenger is brutally murdered. Poirot reluctantly agrees to solve the murder.Well-done remake of the 1970s original. It LOOKS great--wonderful production design and costumes. Also it's beautifully directed by Branagh--some shots of the Express moving through the snow took my breath away. Good acting by the cast too--especially Branagh (although his mustache is distracting) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Still it is slow at times. Also I knew the twist ending from the original so I always knew what was coming up. Still it WAS well-done and if you don't know the ending you might like it more than me.

Sherlock Holmes," Guy Ritchie destroys Sherlock Holmes
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) go head to head with the evil Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who has plans for world domination. A lady from Holmes' past named Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) tries to help them--or is she? OK--I have no problem with trying to reinvent Sherlock Holmes. I've read all the books multiple times and have seen all the movies and most of the TV shows. Trying to update him is not a bad idea BUT he should retain some of what made the character famous. Ritchie obviously doesn't agree and completely destroys the detective. For starters Downey Jr. (a wonderful actor) plays Holmes all wrong. He seems to be drugged out at all times and mumbles his lines in a half-hearted way. Where's the intensity Holmes is supposed to have when he's on a case? Downey shows none of that. His face never changes expression! Even worse is McAdams as Adler. She looks hideous and gives a worse performance than Downey! She is so annoying that, at one part, when she's about to be killed with Holmes trying to save her I felt like saying, 'Oh let her die!' The plot itself makes little sense and is needlessly convoluted. Also the film looks grubby, poorly lit and just plain ugly! Perhaps this was an accurate portrayal of Victorian England but this is supposed to be escapism NOT a documentary! On the plus side Law is great as Watson. He doesn't play him like a bumbling fool--he's young, intelligent and Holmes' equal. He also tells Holmes off in some great parts. Also Strong gives a very strong (sorry) performance as Blackwood. The man is tall and just oozes evil. Also there are multiple action sequences with Holmes and Watson battling the bad guys silly. Now turning Holmes and Watson into action heroes may seem dumb but these are the only parts of the film with any life! Director Ritchie is known for shooting fights and violence in a very convincing way and it works here. These set pieces look like they belong in a dumb summer blockbuster film but at least they add some much needed jolts of life to this movie. However I was looking at my watch a lot during the last hour and could have cared less what was happening. I almost walked out and I NEVER do that! This gets a 2 for the action and some good acting...but I was bored silly. Not recommended.",2,7,12,29 January 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Very silly but enjoyable
",Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.,8,25,34,13 July 2016
Stalag 17," Very good
","Drama that takes place in a POW camp in Germany. The prisoners try and escape and also have a radio--but somehow the Germans always know ahead of time. The prisoners all suspect one of them is an informant and cynical Sefton (William Holden) is immediately suspected and beaten up. But is it really him? Well done drama by Billy Wilder. It's very well-written and directed. Never boring too. It isn't all grim and dreary--there's plenty of humor. I especially got a kick out of a Christmas Eve party the prisoners have--you see guys casually dancing with one another. The acting is good all around (with one exception). Holden won an Oscar for his role and Don Taylor, Peter Graves and Otto Preminger (having a whale of a time playing an evil German) are just great.Still--I can only give this an 8. It makes living at a POW camp look like it's not that bad. I've never been at a POW camp but I don't think that was the case. I realize this (purportedly) was not the inspiration for the TV series 'Hogan's Heroes' but I have my doubts. Also Robert Strauss goes WAY over the top playing Animal. I realize his character was supposed to be funny but I found him annoying. And there was another character who does a bunch of celebrity impersonations which are horrifically bad. Those elements lessened my enjoyment of this. Still I recommend it.",8,3,6,27 November 2007
The Conjuring," Spooky horror movie
","This takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story. A family with five daughters moves into this huge old house in the middle of nowhere. Almost immediately things start going wrong. There's a bad smell in some of the rooms, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07am, the mother wakes up with strange bruises on her arms and legs and there's loud banging heard. The couple hires a husband/wife team of demonologists to check it out...and find out things are worse than they thought.This movie does work. There were many times in here when me (and the audience) jumped or screamed out loud. It builds slowly but it works because you get to know and care about the family. When things DO go overboard at the end it's all the more shocking because you care about the characters. The acting is good across the board. Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are OK in their roles but Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are superb in theirs. There's no nudity, sex or gore but some blood and plenty of scares with loud noises and things suddenly happening. Also the 1970s hairstyles and clothes are frightening too!:) Even though it is scary it goes on just a little bit too long and has its dull moments. I give it a 7.",7,2,6,28 July 2013
Scream," A horror classic
","A maniac is killing off teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro. A bunch of teens (among them Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard) try to figure out who's doing it and why. Meanwhile reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is trying to get the story from the town deputy (David Arquette).This came out in winter 1996. By then horror films were all but dead. However this one was a big hit with critics and audiences and started off a new wave of horror films. Why? Because it has a clever script with MANY references to older horror films; established the rules on how to survive a horror film; had smart, intelligent and likable teenagers and basically played with the genre and reinvented it. Also there is a good sense of humor in this but there's also some very graphic gore (especially at the end). This got an NC-17 from the ratings board until director Wes Craven agreed to tone down on the violence. The acting is good all around, it moves at a fast pace and I was constantly entertained by it. Also the opening 15 minutes with Drew Barrymore is terrifying. The only debit is Lillard. He overacts to a downright embarrassing degree and gets very annoying...especially at the end. Still, him aside, this is a great horror film. Highly recommended.",10,1,2,19 October 2014
Halloween," A classic
","In Haddonfield Illinois in 1963 6 year old Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death on Halloween night. He's committed to a mental institution. 15 years later, on October 30, he escapes and returns to Haddonfield and starts stalking three teenage girls (Jamie Lee Curtis, P.J. Soles and Nancy Loomis). His doctor (Donald Pleasance) also comes looking for him...but can he stop him before he attacks the girls? I saw this great film back in 1978 with an audience full of teenagers (I was 16 myself). How this film got an R rating is beyond me--there's only a few flashes of nudity, one instance of swearing, no sex shown (only under the sheets) and very little blood. I was very lucky to see this film when it first came out with no knowledge of it. By the end of the film I was downright terrified! The whole audience was rooting for Curtis to get away and went wild cheering when she thinks she killed him. This was the first horror film (that I know of) where the killer lived and got away at the end. I have never forgotten the chill that went up my spine at the end when you realize he's still alive and on the loose. It was nothing new plot-wise but it was well-shot (beautiful Panavision images and director John Carpenter makes full use of his wide screen), reasonably well-acted (this was before Jamie Lee Curtis hit it big and she's somewhat awkward) and very VERY scary!**SPOILERS** The bodies falling out of closets, Michael jumping up from behind a couch and sitting up when he's supposed to be dead were terrifying. I had nightmares that night over this! Unfortunately most people now see this after seeing the countless inferior copycat films which stole many things from 'Halloween' like: sex=death; a masked killer; no motivation from the killer (in 'Halloween' it's suggested that Michael is the boogeyman but I always found that kind of silly). What those copycats left out was: likable characters; suspense; teenagers who talk and act like teenagers; scares; logic and lack of gore. Also you're rooting for the girls in this picture not the killer as you are in some others. AND the girls in this one fight back when the killer is after them. Curtis' one on one with Myers at the end is just great and terrifying. A must-see classic. Wide-screen viewing is essential. Great music score too.",10,2,8,29 March 2002
Wonder Woman," It's OK--nothing more
","Story about how Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) came into being. It has her leaving the island where she was born and raised to enter the world of men and help battle World War 1. She also meets Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and falls in love.This has been praised to the high heavens for some reason. It's an OK super hero movie but nothing special. It takes forever to get going (it's almost 90 minutes in before we see Wonder Woman in costume) and it is slow and quite frankly boring. It's also too serious and grim. Why do all DC super hero movies have to be so dark? Also Chris Pine is seriously miscast. On the plus side the action sequences are great. Full of energy and PG rated violence. Nice use of stop motion also. Gadot is great as Wonder Woman. She's strong, fearless and full of energy. Also nice production design and a bombastic music score. I marginally recommend it but it's nothing special.",5,7,16,26 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Harrowing
","Not really an anti-war film but a film showing the callousness and stupidity of military leaders.  The film takes place in France during WWI.  Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas) is ordered by his superior Gen. Mireau (George Macready) to lead his men on a suicide mission to capture a hill the Germans have occupied.  Dax is against it but follows orders.  Things go terribly wrong and three men are (unjustly) courtmartialed for cowardice.  Dax tries his best to save them.Very strong, depressing drama.  Even though its over 40 years old it still shocks you.  Stanley Kubrick's direction is just great especially during the attack sequence and another part near the end.  All the acting is just great--especially Douglas, Macready and Adolphe Menjou.  Script is just fantastic and the movie never strikes a false note...even when you think there might be a (somewhat) happy ending the movie pulls the rug out from under you.  I can't really say I enjoyed the picture...but it makes its point.  The last sequence with the girl singing is really strange--I'm guessing Kubrick added it so the audience wouldn't be TOO depressed!This was a bomb in 1957 (even though critics loved it).  It was too ahead of its time.  It's now regarded as a classic--as it should be.  A definite must-see...just brace yourself.",8,1,2,27 March 2004
Carrie," One of DePalma's best
","High school misfit Carrie (Sissy Spacek) unleashes her telekinetic fury  on her tormentors. This was a huge hit in 1976 and scared me silly. It  doesn't scare me now (except for the closing sequence), but I still  think it's a good solid horror film beautifully handled by Brian De  Palma. It moves quickly, has some beautiful imagery (everything is shot  soft focus with muted color) and has almost uniformally good  performances. The only bad one is by John Travolta way out of his depth  playing a hood.  Amy Irving (as a student who befriends Carrie), William Katt (with a  very 70s afro), Nancy Allen (playing a real bitch), Betty Buckley (so  young and full of energy) and P.J. Soles (silly but bearable) are all  perfect. But Spacek is superb matched by Piper Laurie who is very scary  and marvelous as her deranged, religious mother.   Also the film is (by today's standards) very restrained in terms of  blood and gore. And the final sequence will make you jump (also notice  the cars in the background during that--they're moving backwards!)  Only complaints--De Palma REALLY hates some of the high school  kids--you feel like like he's working out some personal issues here.  And did we really need the slow-mo shower sequence at the beginning?  That aside--this is a great film. See it letter boxed.",10,52,75,26 September 2001
Shrek," Finally! A good 2001 movie!
","This has been a horrible year for movies so far--no doubt about it.  From horrendous comedies to lousy horror films to boring art fims it's been a sad year.  Finally, though, a really good film has come along.  'Shrek' is a computer animated comedy for all ages.  It's one of those rare films that adults and children can enjoy.  Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers with a Scottish accent), is a large green-skinned ogre who goes to save a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a fiery dragon.  Why?  Because evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is destroying his property but will spare it if he saves the princess.  An abrasive donkey (Eddie Murphy) comes along to help.  Murphy gets a little too loud and abrasive and the movie does have its dull stretches, but mostly the jokes are flying fast and furious, the animation is flawless and occasionally beautiful, and the whole thing has a happy ending.  There's also a few hilarious pot shots at Disney.  Go, see it and enjoy!  Well worth 10 bucks.",8,3,4,4 June 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," It's good--but an Oscar winner?
","Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) an FBI cadet is hired to try to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). He's a cannibal and VERY dangerous. Also there's a psychopath named Buffalo Bill kidnapping girls and skinning them alive. Lecter hints that he knows who Bill is and Clarice tries to find out...but Lecter is playing serious mind games with her. I caught this back in 1991. I liked it but I thought Foster was just OK and I found the story pretty confusing with glaring lapses in logic. Seeing it now some 17 years later I still feel the same way. The film is somewhat slow and I wasn't that scared or upset by it. Also Foster (who's Southern accent comes and goes at an alarming rate) is just OK. I'm really surprised that she won the Oscar for this. PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!! There was also a lot of gay groups who complained that Buffalo Bill was a transsexual. As a gay guy I wasn't offended but other people were just horrified. END SPOILER!!! Still the movie isn't a total washout. Hopkins is just superb as Lecter. He's downright terrifying at times. He's only on screen about a total of 30 minutes but you always feel his presence. Also his breakout (while completely illogical) is one of the scariest sequences I've ever seen. The whole movie is well-directed especially during the final sequence. Also it's the first horror film since 1932 to win an acting Academy Award. Heck, it won quite a few! Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Foster), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. So, it's a very good thriller worth catching...but Academy Award material? I think it was a little overpraised.For horror fans there's an extra kick of seeing Roger Corman in a small role!'...I'm having an old friend for dinner.'",8,11,30,13 February 2008
Vanilla Sky," Another lousy Tom Cruise movie
","Long, boring, stupid movie about Cruise...oh forget it!  I can't be bothered!  This movie was total crap--bad script (especially the end), very dull and overlong...I believe 5 people walked out of the theatre...I should have joined them.The acting--Cameron Diaz is very good--sadly, she's not in the movie enough to make a difference.  Penelope Cruz tries but the script isn't there for her.  Jason Lee is surprisingly very good as Cruise's best friend.  As for Cruise...well...he can't act.  He's truly pathetic in this film...it was almost embarrassing to watch.  His character comes off as a total blank because Cruise doesn't know how to play it.  The guy has just two facial expressions--grinning or having a slack-jawed 'I'm stupid' expression on his face.  Hopeless.  He's ugly too.  Also, he's playing a 32 year old here. Come on!!!!  Cruise is 39 and looks it!This is a total waste of time and money.  AVOID!!!!!!!",1,4,15,27 December 2001
X-Men: First Class," At its best is was OK
","A rebooting of the X-Men. It gives us the origin of Dr. X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). They are no longer brothers--Dr. X is a brilliant scientist and Magneto saw his mother brutally killed in a German concentration camp. Most of this takes place in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis (so we can have a younger--and hotter--cast). Sebastian Stan (Kevin Bacon) is an evil mutant who (with some followers) wants to start a world wide apocalypse. Dr. X and his band of good mutants set out to stop him.The special effects are top notch and this movie clearly was made on a BIG budget with incredible locations and such...but I was bored. The script is VERY slow and the constant 'winks' at the audience (dialogue that clearly shows future events) gets tiresome. The evil mutants are never introduced by name (except for Emma Frost) and their powers are never explained leading to confusion (in the audience). Add to that is the totally unnecessary length (this film could have wrapped up in less than 2 hours), plot holes all over the place and historical inaccuracies galore. Even worse some of the acting is terrible--Lucas Till is dreadful as Havoc and McAvoy is bad too. Even worse is Bacon! To top it all off the one black mutant is killed off early on! I thought that kind of scripting went out in the 1960s! It struck me as ridiculously racist. On the good side--Fassbender is GREAT as Magneto and January Jones is terrific as Emma Frost (although she is captured far too easily--and never even attempts to escape). A cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is hysterical and easily the best part of the movie! The use of multiple screens during the training sessions were nice too. But, all in all, I found this boring and pointless. I was looking at my watch more than the screen! A 4 all the way.",4,13,26,11 June 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," In many ways this is just an ordinary romantic drama with BDSM thrown in
","College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with her and she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and is into BDSM. Can she deal with that? Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is just another romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issues just happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings, the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (but tasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's not that bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornan just bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strange that a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's also well-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on for too long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Grey comes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnson is very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and all pumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All in all a pretty good romantic drama.",7,14,22,2 March 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight flops
","This takes place eight years after the events of the previous film. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a recluse never going out and holing up inside Wayne Manor. Batman also has not been seen being accused of killing a person. Then Bane (Tom Hardy) invades Gotham (for no reason) to take it over (again, for no reason). Also Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) is a master thief on the loose. Can Batman come out of 'retirement' and battle them? Long (almost three hours), loud (VERY loud) and terrible movie. I'm no fan of the other two but they weren't THIS bad! The plot takes forever to get going and Batman himself is hardly in it! He doesn't even show up until 45 minutes in. The plot is more than a little vague. Why exactly is Bane attacking Gotham? The movie never tells us. Also a character escapes from a jail in some Arabian country and pops up in Gotham AFTER it's been cut off from the rest of the world. How? What exactly does Selina Kyle have to do with any of this? Her character comes and goes quickly. There are more plot holes but those are the biggest. Also there's a twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and does nothing but complicate the plot. That aside the movie is sadistic (people are killed off left and right AND their bodies are hung from bridges), slow (I was constantly checking my watch), LOUD (the music is far too loud and pounds you into submission) and grim. There's a constant feeling of depression in the movie that got to me. Oh yes and there's room for a sequel!!!!! On the good side the acting is all good. Bale was great and Hathaway is terrific (but we see far too little of her). Hardy is obviously having a whale of a time in his role and doesn't even attempt to cover his British accent. Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Gordon), Morgan Freeman (as Lucius Fox), Michael Caine (as Alfred) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are great too. The special effects are incredible but the consistently grim tone take any wonder out of them. This is a vicious cruel and dull movie that just pounds the audience mercilessly and offers no thrills or entertainment. A 1 all the way.",1,23,43,5 August 2012
Any Given Sunday," OK, but WAY overdone
","Well, Oliver Stone has gotten Vietnam out of his system, now it's time to take on pro football. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!! OK story (young, excellent quarterback tries to take over team from the coach) but that's about it. Stone treats this story like it's big news (Football is corrupt!!!!  No kidding); he constantly cuts from one image to another VERY quickly--too quickly; women are treated as either b****es, sex objects, prostitutes or just nice scenary; EVERY football scene is shot closeup, so that it's impossible to tell what's going on, with bone-crunching sound; and at the very end every single major character COMPLETELY, with no discernable reason, becomes nice and forgiving and leaves us with a big old happy ending!  The acting is good (especially Diaz and Pacino) but they're all playing stock characters.  Also Diaz's character is treated very cruely at the end--memo to Oliver Stone:  STOP HATING WOMEN SO MUCH!  Ann-Margret, Mathew Modine and James Woods are all as good as they possibly can be, but are totally wasted in secondary roles--Woods only has two scenes!  Also the film is too long--2 hours and 40 minutes.  If you're desperate for a football film, this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away---FAR away!",6,0,0,4 January 2000
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," What a mess!
","This takes place 18 months after the events in 'Man of Steel'. Superman (Henry Cavill) is still around performing good deeds but people are unsure of him. Batman (Ben Affleck) especially doesn't like him. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) discovers kryptonite--the one thing that can kill Superman. He wants to use it against him...but so doesn't Batman. Luthor also develops a monster called Doomsday that Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) have to battle before it destroys Metropolis.What a waste! The script makes little sense and is slow-moving and dreary. There's plot holes big enough for the Batmobile and no real point. There's also these sequences where Supes and Bats are complaining and moping about being heroes. Since when have they been so whiny? The whole movie is depressing and needlessly violent. Acting doesn't help at all. Cavill is terrible as Superman. He LOOKS the part but always has a blank expression on his face. Eisenberg is even worse as Luthor. I still can't figure out WHAT the hell he was trying to do. He's not funny, cute, interesting or sinister. Just stupid and puzzling. Amy Adams is wasted as Lois Lane. She has nothing to do in this except get rescued by Superman. Only Gadot and Affleck (who's superb) give good performances. However they can't save the film and the plot really weighs down everything. By the time the big battle came by the end I was too bored to even care. Director Snyder knows how to direct action sequences but when it comes to dramatics he's clueless. A boring, depressing and utterly pointless movie. VERY disturbing ending too. Skip it.",1,22,45,30 March 2016
Ben-Hur," Spectacular but way too long
","Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) a Jew, and Massala (Stephen Boyd) a Roman, once boyhood friends clash as adults in Biblical times. Big, lumbering epic--way too long (3 1/2 hours). It does have two spectacular action sequences--the sea battle and the chariot race.The sea battle has some very obvious, sometimes laughable special effects--for instance, it's VERY obvious that they're using toy boats in the long shots! Still. it is exciting and well-done.The chariot race is just great. A must see in wide-screen ONLY--it's long, violent and fascinating. It still stands up after over 40 years.The rest of the film is rather slow. The dialogue is ponderous. The pace is way too slow and none of the performances are that good (how Heston won an Academy Award for this is beyond me). But it looks great in wide screen and color and has a rousing music score. I'm giving it an 8, but I really can't recommend it. Give me the 1925 Ramon Novarro one--that was much better.",8,13,34,20 May 2002
Casino Royale," James Bond reinvented--darkly
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is after world terrorists in this one. Judi Dench is back as M telling him off left and right. The plot is kind of vague but it ends up with Bond and a sexy sidekick (Eva Green) paired off against a thoroughly evil man (Mads Mikkelsen).OK--James Bond has been reinvented in this film with Craig in the role. Is Craig good as Bond? Kind of. He's not handsome at all (at 38 he looks 45) but he has a great body, holds his own in fight scenes and is a VERY good actor. Also this Bond is more serious than the others. He's not making bad jokes (like Roger Moore did) or acting like a sexist pig (Sean Connery). He's dead serious and will kill when he has to--the previous Bond films seemed to shy away from Bond killing anybody. This Bond also gets hurt (you see his face crisscrossed with scratches after one fight) and he bleeds--quite a lot too. This film is VERY violent--it pushes the PG-13 rating to its limit. I personally think it went too far--the torture scene where he is tied nude to a chair was not needed. Not everything has changed though--he has a beautiful woman by his side who eventually falls for him...and is of NO use in a fight (once or twice I wanted to yell at Green to do something). But Green IS good and looks stunning.The film is a little too long (but most Bond films are) and doesn't make much sense. Still, all in all, it was an entertaining movie. I'm only giving it an 8 because I think the violence went overboard. Still this is an interesting redo of Bond. Worth catching.",8,2,7,8 December 2006
Space Jam," Silly but hard to dislike
","Movie about Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Roadrunner etc etc). An evil animated monster runs Moron Mountain--a planet with an amusement park. They need a new ride so he sends five helpers to Earth to kidnap the Looney Tunes characters. Then they can be used as a new act at the amusement park. Bugs and the others agree--IF they play them in a basketball game and win. Bugs and the others convince Michael Jordan to help them--but the aliens have evil plans up their sleeve.Michael Jordan meets the Looney Tunes. Sounds like a sure recipe for disaster. I was positive this film was going to be a bomb when it was released (with HEAVY publicity) in 1996. Yes--it's silly but if you love Looney Tunes (like I do) you'll probably love this. The characters are treated (more or less) respectfully and during the climatic basketball game the stands are full of every Warner Bros. cartoon character ever made. One small mouse character who talks nonstop I remembered from childhood and I literally broke up laughing when he appeared! The animation is just great, the merging of live action with cartoon figures works and the script is fun. There are groaners and stupid lines but, all in all, it was pretty amusing.The debits: Michael Jordan just can't act. I'm sure he was a wonderful basketball player but his acting was as wooden as a basketball court. Also various other sports figures pop up and prove they're worse actors than Jordan! Bill Murray (who can be good) is just lousy in a supporting role. And Wayne Knight is just SO annoying. Also I could have lived without seeing the Warner Bros. logo popping up everywhere. At one point it's on Daffy Duck's butt...and he kisses it! And there's a brief take-off on 'Pulp Fiction' which isn't as funny now as it was in 1996. So, these things lessen the movie but don't destroy it. Worth catching if you're a Warner Bros. animation fan. Kids will love it. I give it a 7.",7,24,32,2 April 2008
Signs," Great while watching but...
","I had a lot of unanswered questions afterwords. M. Night Shyamalan is a great visual director...there are some beautiful shots here. But with plots...Farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds gigantic, interconnected circles in his cornfield. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and Graham's two children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) think there's something supernatural going on. Graham disagrees...until things start getting real scary. Also Graham keeps having nightmares about his dead wife who died in a car accident and made him give up being a pastor...SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The film is very creepy and eerie in the first half (the first full view of the aliens made me jump and the pantry sequence!) but drops the ball in the second half. For one thing, you think it's an alien invasion story but it turns into a story about faith. The aliens are just there as a plot device!Also giving us long shots of the aliens was not a good idea--it's very clear that they're guys in rubber suits. Still, it did scare me occasionally.MORE SPOILERS!!!! But, afterwords, I had a lot of questions. Why do the aliens (who can be killed by water) attack a planet that is 3/4 water? Why do they attack in the first place (there's something about harvesting people...what does that mean?)? One alien is locked inside a pantry and can't get out???? Also how exactly are they defeated at the end (we're not told)? These are nagging questions that I couldn't shake off.And the film is quiet...way too quiet at times. And the faith story is awkwardly handled.The acting doesn't help. Gibson is blank-faced the entire time and Culkin and Breslin are terrible. Phoenix tries but the slow pace and insistence on quiet drags him down. So, it's worth seeing...if you don't think about it afterwords.",7,7,17,5 August 2002
The Deer Hunter," Boring, historically inaccurate and FAR too long
","Story about three buddies (played by Robert DeNiro, John Savage and Christopher Walken) going off to Vietnam. They're all gung ho about going and aren't prepared for what they experience. They all return home--one mentally affected, one physically handicapped and one dead.This came out in 1978 and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. It was one of the few movies that dealt with Vietnam realistically (somewhat). It also really hit a lot of Vietnam vets and young guys hard. A friend of mine went to see it and after it was over he was in the mens room and saw 4 guys in their 20s crying nonstop. I saw it around that time. I was in high school and was bored silly. I figured at the time I was too young to appreciate it. I saw it years later and was STILL bored.For starters--it's too long--3 hours. The wedding sequence at the beginning goes on and on and ON. You learn nothing more about the characters than you could have in about 10 minutes. Even after they return home it moves slowly. The Russian roulette sequences (which were VERY hotly debated) never happened in reality. There's no proof at all that it ever happened. Also one character makes a living out of playing Russian roulette???? Come on! The Vietnamese are portrayed as victims or monsters--very black and white. No shadings of character. With the sole exceptions of DeNiro, Savage and Meryl Strepp the acting sucks. Seriously--HOW did Walken get an Oscar for this? DeNiro should have gotten it. And the irony at the end (when they're all singing 'God Bless America') was SO heavy-handed it was almost comic. Wildly overpraised and overrated. This does not belong in the top 250 on IMDb.

Identity," Very good
","On a dark and stormy night 11 strangers have to take refuge in an isolated motel when a rainstorm turns into a monsoon.  One by one they begin to be killed...but by who and for what reason?The set-up is neat (if predictable) and there's a great opening showing how the actions of one of them (Amanda Peet) inadvertantly causes some serious damage for the others.  There also is some great acting by Peet, John C. McGinley and Ray Liotta (who REALLY chews the scenery).  There are also some moments that will make you jump and there are two neat twists at the end.The only bad things about this movie is some clumsy exposition (John Cusack tells his whole life story while photographing a corpse), some truly bad lines and a surprisingly lousy performance by Cusack.  What's happened to him?  He looks worn-out and haggard in this film.However, these are minor problems and the film is well worth seeing and keeps you guessing about what's going on till the last moment.  Worth catching.WARNING:  This film is NOT for children!",8,60,101,26 April 2003
Beowulf," The 3-D animation is all this has going for it
","Powerful Beowulf journeys to a village to destroy a monster named Grendel. Unfortunately he doesn't realize Grendel has a mother to deal with too.OK--the 3-D animation is incredible. The characters look and act like real people. The voices match the characters perfectly also. Also, despite the PG-13 rating, this has plenty of nudity--mostly male. Beowulf has a long battle with Grendel--and he's completely nude during it! Still there are no frontal shots and you're always aware that you're looking at a computer-animated figure. Also the female nudity is pretty minor--you see breasts but no nipples. There's also some pretty extreme gore but it all comes across as fairly unrealistic. If this had been done live action it probably would have gotten an R. But, that aside, this is pretty routine and boring.The story has been read by probably every kid in U.S. so you know exactly what's going to happen. Also they speak in Old English and it gets tiresome. Some of the speech is unintelligible--I couldn't understand half of Grendel's lines and Angelina Jolie (playing his mom) puts on a very strange accent. Also there's an ending that (surprise surprise) actually leaves room for a sequel! However I've never liked fantasy movies (except for the Lord of the Rings trilogy) so maybe it's no surprise that I was bored by this and looking at my watch far too much. But, again, the 3-D animation was superb and doesn't leave you with the blinding headaches that the old 3-D did. So--use your own judgment on how much you like fantasy for this.",5,3,6,24 November 2007
Speed," Great action sequences but this movie is incredibly stupid
","LAPD officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his buddy officer Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) foil the plans of a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) to hold a bunch of people hostage for millions of dollars. In retaliation he sets up a bus that if it goes under 50 MPH it will blow up and kill all the people on board. Naturally Jack gets on the bus and with the help of spunky Annie Parker (Sandra Bullock) tries to deal with the situation.OK--this movie is REALLY stupid. It has an incredibly dumb plot full of implausible situations and jaw-dropping coincidences. Add to that stupid dialogue, one-dimensional characters, a totally unbelievable (and unnecessary) romance between Bullock and Reeves and truly terrible 'comic' relief and you got one horrendous movie. However this film does have absolutely astounding action sequences. They're loud, realistic and shot so you're right there with them. Despite the stupid plot these sequences kept me watching. Reeves gives another wooden performance but he looks great with a buzz cut and all pumped up. This is the film that made Bullock a star and rightfully so. She's just great in a severely underwritten part. Hopper surprisingly is pretty bad in his role. He usually plays these parts to perfection but he seems going on auto pilot here. Daniels barely figures in this. So the action is astounding but the really dumb plot kept working against it. I can only give it a 5.",5,6,13,20 December 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Loud, big, silly and LOTS of fun!
","This review is based on the unrated version--I've never seen the PG-13 one. The FBI Cyber Security Division and other government computers are breached by a madman (Timothy Olyphant) who plans to rule the world (or something like that). John McClane (Bruce Willis) ends up stuck with a young computer hacker (Justin Long) to try and battle him.OK--I LOVED the first two 'Die Hard' films. They were loud, stupid and loads of fun (if a bit sadistic). The third one ('Die Hard With a Vengeance') wasn't too good. This one was (obviously) shot for an R rating (the first three were all R). The studio cut it down to a PG-13. I HATE when they do that and refuse to see it. So that's why I waited till this came on DVD to view it.This is a fast-moving, easy to understand action movie. It's full of swearing and it's VERY violent--sometimes a bit too much. Willis' battle with Mai (Maggie Q) is pretty extreme. Still, you have to expect that from a 'Die Hard' film. The action sequences are truly incredible (even on a TV screen) and there's plenty of casual violence and blood and gore. The script is dumbed down so anyone can understand it--but who watches this movie for the plot? I had a fun time but towards the end the action goes WAY over the top and gets totally unbelievable. STILL I enjoyed it.The acting is just about what you expect. Willis is good in his role (as always) and Long is good also despite having to be the 'comic' relief at times. Olyphant is OK (I guess) as the villain...but I could never take him seriously. Basically everybody just hits their marks and say their lines with total conviction--that's all this calls for. Kevin Smith is very funny in his bit as Warlock. So--loud and stupid but fun. See the unrated version.",8,0,0,24 December 2007
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first but not a great movie
","Picks up right where the first one left off. The plot is way too convoluted to get into--there's enough plot for three movies here, and that's the main problem. More than once the movie has to come to a screeching halt for exposition and it really bogs things down. Also there were too many characters--that was a problem with the first film. This time they compound it by adding MORE characters! Also Cyclops and Professor X were horribly underused. There were also a few nagging questions left unanswered--PLEASE SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Where does Collosus take the mutant children when the school is under attack? And why is Wolverine's past STILL a mystery at the end?Still, the movie did a lot of good things. They did get rid of two of the stupider villains (Sabretooth and Toad). They added Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who gets a lot of screen time and beefed up the roles of Iceman, Pyro and Rogue. Also, Collosus has a few scenes. As with the first movie, Wolverine is center stage again (this is a good thing) and Halle Berry seems much more comfortable as Storm the second time around. The younger cast members seem very comfortable with their roles (especially Paquin) and Ian McKellan is great again as Magneto. Also Mystique has much more screen time and the sequences with her were just great.Also the acting is good, the special effects terrific and it was very touching at the end.So, aside from a few dead spots, this is a very good super hero movie.",8,0,3,11 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Very good but not great
","This follows 30+ years after 'Return of the Jedi'. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi knight, has disappeared and no one knows where. However a map is found that shows where he is. Two groups want it--the evil First Order and good Resistance. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) pop up as do Chewabacca, C3PO and R2D2. Also two young people--Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Riddy)--help the Resistance.I saw it in IMAX 3D. The 3D is not needed but the IMAX really helps. This film is BIG! It moves quickly, has great special effects, a fairly good cast (it was great to see Fisher, Ford and Hamill again) and was pretty well-done. The plot was hardly deep but 'Star Wars' film plots never are. The acting was pretty good by all especially Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. However the plot had holes in it (what was with C3PO's red arm?) and Adam Driver was terrible as the evil Kylo Ren. Very wooden. Still I was entertained. This is MUCH better than episodes 1, 2 and 3.",7,12,42,31 December 2015
Final Destination," Interesting idea, bad execution
","The basic idea was good--teens going on a flight to Paris--one freaks out because he dreams of the plane crashing--he's escorted off the plane with a bunch of friends following--they're not allowed back on--the plane takes off and blows up. They cheated death, but he comes back and goes after them one by one. Can they cheat him again?Interesting but the dialogue is terrible (the scene in the funeral home with Tony (Candyman) Todd is particularly bad), the acting is lousy and basically I was bored silly. After a while you were just waiting for the next teen to get it. The death scenes were well done and gruesome, but it gets kind of depressing when you realize you're just waiting for the next teen to get it. Also, logic flies completely out the window at the end.

","I love Hitchcocks' movies--he was undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our time--but what's the big deal about this movie.  It's well-directed (obviously) and the acting is good, but the story is predictable, the dialogue dull (except for a few of Thelma Ritter's wisecracks) and it's just plain boring!  Also I can't seriously accept the fact that someone as beautiful and classy as Grace Kelly would fall in love with Stewart.  He's old enough to be her father!  So, I don't see why everybody loves this film, and I consider it one of Hitchcocks' lesser works.",5,18,38,23 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Can't say I liked it
","First of, I LOVED the first two movies.  Well-written, beautifully directed with eye-popping special effects and never boring (despite their length). Well...it doesn't hold true for this one.Yes--the direction is good, the special effects still fantastic...but I was bored.  It had an air of 'been there--seen that' about it.  I've seen these special effects, I've seen these creatures...there were no surprises.  And the story moves VERY slowly...much slower than the first two.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's trip to Mount Doom took FOREVER!  Also Viggo Mortensen (after giving a good performance in the second one) really was lousy this time around.  Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies were good but hardly in it.  The best acting was from Ian McKellan (a tower of strength as Gandalf) and Sean Astin as Sam.  Also it was good to see Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett back again...and I DID enjoy the battles somewhat...but I was continuously looking at my watch.  And the film has at least FIVE endings!Also the tone of this film was darker than the first two and this film is WAY too violent for a PG-13--this is an R rating all the way.I can only give this a 7.  I just really didn't like it.",7,8,18,1 February 2004
The Purge," Has its moments...but not enough of them
","This takes places in 2022. Unemployment is at 1%, crime is non-existent and everything is fine. However, for one night in the year, ALL crime (murder mostly) is legal so people can 'purge' themselves. One family is all protected in their house--but their son lets in an unarmed man who is running from a mob that wants to kill him. The mob tells the family give him to us...or they'll all die.The premise is ridiculous any way you look at it; people do REAL stupid things and the dialogue and situations are laughable...but it still works in parts. The family is likable (if dysfunctional) so you really feel for them when they're attacked; the masks the group wears are REAL creepy; the people playing psychos don't overact and there's bursts of extreme violence and blood (but not much). What I found more disturbing was my audience was cheering on the violence which was NOT the idea. Still I have to admit when two particularly vicious villains got what was coming to them I applauded. So I have mixed feelings about this one.",5,4,6,9 June 2013
Heat," Overdone but good
","Police detective Al Pacino is after mastermind thief Robert De Niro. Also De Niro's partner Val Kilmer is having trouble with his wife (Ashley Judd); De Niro falls for nice Amy Brennerman and Pacino is having issues with HIS wife (Diane Venora). Also Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi and Dennis Haysbert appear in supporting roles.Big, sprawling cops and robbers drama. There are multiple story lines and all the characters are fully realized individuals. The acting is great across the board (except for Kilmer). There was a lot made of this film because of the 8 minute sequence in which De Niro and Pacino face off verbally against each other. They're both great and the sequence is crucial to their characters--but it isn't particularly well-written. Still this might be the only time we'll ever see the two together on screen (They both starred in 'The Godfather Part II' but shared no scenes).The movie is well-directed with constant close-ups (for some reason) and shot in washed out color with some truly incredible gun fights (the last one is just jaw dropping). An ALMOST great movie.There are problems. There are too many story lines and the film becomes quite convoluted towards the end. For example--a subplot between Pacino and his stepdaughter comes up, disappears and pops in out of NOWHERE at the end. Also the film is much too long at 3 hours. This worked great in a theatre in wide screen and ear-shattering stereo (the gun shots went right through you). It doesn't work as well on TV. Also avoid the edited for TV version which cuts out about FORTY minutes rendering the film incomprehensible. Worth watching...but it should have been tightened a little.",8,5,12,1 April 2006
Footloose," For WHAT IT IS (a remake of a fun 1980s musical) it's not bad
","Rem MacCormack (Kenny Wormwald) moves to the small town of Bomont after his mom dies. He lives with his aunt, uncle and their little girls. He finds out Bomont has a ban against loud music and dancing which was pushed by the Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) when his son was killed driving home from dancing. Ren thinks it's ridiculous and fights it. He also falls for the reverend's hot daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough).OK--I'm a big fan of the original. I saw it multiple times up the theatre and on cable and got the original soundtrack on vinyl (kids--ask your parents!)and then again on CD. I was dreading this remake but it's actually pretty OK. It starts GREAT with a bunch of kids dancing very well to the title tune and basically follows the original script. Some of the dialogue is lifted verbatim from the original! Still there are plenty of changes--there are plenty of dramatic scenes that weren't in the original, the chicken game with tractors is turned into a race between four buses (!!!), some of the songs are (unwisely) replaced with rap songs and the dancing has changed. 'Holding Out for a Hero' is heard once in the background and 'Somebody's Eyes' was used when Willard (Miles Tenner) learns how to dance--but most of the songs from the original were left out. Also there's more swearing here and the fights between the teenagers are pretty brutal (for a PG-13). The acting isn't bad. Wormald is just an OK actor but he can really dance unlike Kevin Bacon in the original. He's a handsome guy too. Hough is beautiful as Ariel (LOVE those eyes) and she can act AND sing:) Everybody else is OK in their roles especially Quaid as the reverend. The dancing is incredible--full of life and energy and the whole audience applauded at the end! So--not a great movie but pretty good as a remake of the original.",6,2,12,15 October 2011
Deadpool," Great but sometimes loses its footing
",**POTENTIAL SPOILERS** A mercenary named Wade (Ryan Reynolds) is happily in love and just proposed to his girlfriend. However he finds out he has cancer. A mysterious man contacts him and says he can be cured of his cancer...but won't say how. Wade agrees to whatever treatment. He is tied down and tortured and pumped full of drugs by evil Ajax (Ed Skrein). It turns him ugly and into a mutant able to withstand any pain and a body that completely regenerates itself. He escapes and sets out to find Ajax and kill him. He wears a costume and calls himself Deadpool.Despite the synopsis this movie is actually quite funny. There are constant jokes by Reynolds and he's frequently breaking down the fourth wall and addressing the audience. There's also TONS of gratuitous violence but it's impossible to take it seriously with Reynolds constantly making jokes. It also has cameos by two of the X-Men and Stan Lee! However the sequence when we see Deadpool being tortured and shot full of drugs is not fun and Ajax is such a despicable villain the fun sort of drains out at times. However the final all out battle at the end makes up for it. So I liked it but it sometimes got too brutal. Still it is recommended. Also Reynolds is excellent in his role.,7,2,11,7 March 2016
Thirteen Days," Engrossing
","A docudrama about the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. This could have been a boring history lesson but it's anything but that. The film moves quickly despite its length (135 minutes). All the characters are introduced with subtitles which helps immensely in understanding who they are and their perspective in the crisis. The direction is quick and assured and the music score loud and thrilling. With one exception, all the acting is great. Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Robert Culp as Robert Kennedy are especially fine. They aren't dead ringers for the Kennedys but get the accents and portrayals down perfect. The only bad performance is by Kevin Costner--his accent is way off (I was born and raised in MA, so trust me) and he just gives a dull, by-the-numbers performance. Still, everything surrounding him is great so he doesn't really hurt the film. Well worth seeing. Also, it's frightening to realize how close we came to nuclear war.",Null,0,0,22 January 2001
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Has its moments but gets way too cruel and vicious
","Gary 'Eggsy' (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.This has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was 'Kick-Ass' which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.On the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel.",6,8,18,25 February 2015
Ran," Beautiful but slow
","Gorgeous photography and some great acting help this Japanese version of 'King Lear'.  The only real problem is that it starts off interesting, has an incredible battle scene and then comes to a screeching halt.  It stays that way for about an hour before it picks up for another battle scene at the end.  This movie could easily have been edited--it's way too long (160 minutes).  Still, as I said, the photography was beautiful and I was lucky enough to see a brand-new print at a revival theatre--this film would really suffer on TV.  Good movie, but too long.",8,3,10,5 July 2000
Cube," Great sci-fi premise but...
",not enough for a 90 minute film.Five people find themselves trapped in a giant cube and try to find a way out through adjornying cubes...but some contain death traps.This would make a real good 45 minute feature but this is dragged out to twice that length.  The characters are pretty unlikable and it gets repititous and downright boring at times.  Good acting by everybody helps but only to a certain degree.  Lousy ending too.Don't bother.,4,3,10,5 March 2003
Fantastic Four," Why all the bad reviews? This is pretty good!
","Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her kid brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chikilis) and Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) are all exposed to cosmic radiation giving them superpowers. Richards can stretch any part of his body and is called Mr. Fantastic; Sue can turn invisible and project force fields--she's called Invisible Girl (it should be Woman); Johnny can turn into a living flame AND fly--he's the Human Torch; Grimm becomes a monster made of orange rocks and called The Thing. von Doom begins to go insane and turn into metal--he becomes the evil Dr. Doom.Adaptation of the popular comic book actually isn't bad. They make only slight changes to the origins (unlike 'Batman Begins'), cast them well and threw in tons of excellent special effects. The story moves quickly and has plenty of action (I've never seen so many car crashes in one movie).There are problems though--and it's mostly with the acting. Gruffudd (completely covering his accent) does very well as Richards--he looks and acts like the character in the books. However Alba is TERRIBLE. Yes--she is beautiful but can't act. Her face had a blank expression throughout. Evans, surprisingly, is only so-so. He's a talented guy and I thought he could pull off the role of a young, cocky, arrogant guy--but he seems to be holding back. Chikilis is excellent as The Thing. Even though he's in a costume you can see his pain and anger at being turned into a monster. Also McMahon is excellent as Doom--he downplays it--but it works well.It's loud, silly but loads of fun. I really can't see why all the critics are blasting this. It's not that bad! I give it an 8.",8,4,12,15 July 2005
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The continued weak acting of Stewart and Lautner really hurts this one.
","The continuing adventures of vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the human girl named Bella who loves him (Kristen Stewart) and another guy named Jacob who's a werewolf (Taylor Lautner). Problem is Jacob loves Bella and Bella has to choose between Edward and him while a bunch of deadly vampires prepare an attack.This started off pretty well. It's well-directed, has some beautiful cinematography and Pattinson and his family are all good actors. Also we get flashbacks to Edward's family and why they became vampires and those are interesting. Also the werewolves are great! Unknown Xavier Samuel also makes a strong impression as Riley. Then what's the problem? Stewart and Lautner. They are TERRIBLE! Their faces never change expression and you seriously don't know how to take their scenes. More than once I thought why were Edward and Jacob were even interested in her! She's whiny and expressionless! We also get at least FIVE conversations over who she should pick as a boyfriend. It got old real quick. These talks are boring and really drag the movie down. Still the teenage girls in my audience seemed riveted. I also got a good laugh of how they all groaned when you first see Lautner with his shirt off (he IS in very good shape). The final fight is also lots of fun--quick and violent with great special effects. This gets a 6 for Pattinson and all the other actors, some beautiful scenes and the special effects--but Stewart and Lautner really wear this down.",6,2,8,5 July 2010
Sin City," Hard movie to rate
",Visually stunning adaptation of some comic books. There's three stories in here: One has Bruce Willis as a cop trying to protect a young girl (Jessica Alba) from a rapist. Another has a grotesque man named Marv (Mickey Rourke) trying to avenge a prostitute's murder. The third has a man (Clive Owen) taking on a bunch of hoodlums (led by Benicio Del Toro) who once abused his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy). And the movie opens and end with a man (Josh Hartnett) killing a woman (?????)Visually this is incredible. It's shot in black and white with splashes of color in it. For instance...in the opening Hartnett and a woman are talking--everything is b&w except her dress which is in bright red. Really catches the eye. Also it's narrated by the various characters in tough guy prose that could have been lifted from a film noir of the 1940s. It perfectly fits the tone and visuals of the movie. Also almost all the acting is great--Willis is good but Owen is incredible and Rourke is just superb--this is a major comeback role for him. Also Rosario Dawson is strong. Only Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy are bad.Sounds like a great movie--right? Well---I almost walked out four times.The violence in this is EXTREME--body parts are shot off or hacked off left and right and people are shot multiple times. The violence in here bothered me--a lot. Usually violence doesn't make me flinch but here I was squirming in my seat. Also all the women are portrayed as victims or vicious whores. And virtually every female character has a nude scene. I don't blame director Rodriguez for that--but I DO blame co-director and writer Frank Miller. The constant nudity gets a little bit embarrassing--the objectification of all the women disturbed me. I didn't see the guys get this treatment. The closest we get to male nudity is Owen with his shirt off. People could say that the women come off well--when they're killing people and wearing see through outfits.All this bothered me a LOT--more than it should. I'm giving this an 8 for the visuals and acting...but I can't deny it...I find this film disturbing.,8,5,11,29 April 2005
Saboteur," Strange but very good Hitchcock movie
","Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war. He goes on the run, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice.There are a lot of things wrong with this film. Robert Cummings was a good actor but he's totally miscast in this role; Priscilla Lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this WAS made while WWII was in full swing) and there's no ending. It shouldn't work but it does.It's full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they're falling in love), 'I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago' (????!!!!); Lane PAYS a villain for getting her lunch and Cummings and Lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run. Also Hitchcock's direction was (as always) just great--he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences--especially the Statue of Liberty climax. This is not one of Hitchcock's classic movie but is still very good and worth catching.",8,29,42,25 November 2004
The Ugly Truth," Thoroughly predictable but I loved it!
","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a seriously uptight TV producer. Her show is bombing in the ratings and she scares away any guy she dates. Then she is forced to add sexist, out-spoken Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) who gives advice on 'The Ugly Truth'--a short segment where he tells the truth about relationships. Abby hates him but the ratings soar. To make peace Mike tells Abby he'll help her get handsome Colin (Eric Winter). If she does she backs off. She agrees and gets Colin and then the predictable complications ensure.OK--I KNEW who this was going to end 15 minutes in but I STILL loved it! It starts off great with Katy Perry's 'Hot N Cold' roaring out during the opening credits and just keeps getting better! Heigl is gorgeous and an excellent actress. She nailed all the comedy completely. Butler--all hot and handsome--matches her perfectly and the interplay between them really works. I heard they got along great on the set and it shows. Eric Winter is charming and handsome but the guy is (purposely) not given much to work with. The script is sharp, moves quickly and has plenty of funny moments. What I like most is the script has VERY frank adult sexual talk--it doesn't dumb it down to a PG-13. It's rare to get an R rated romcom aimed at adults these days! My only complaint is Heigl's character is treated a bit TOO cruelly at times (especially in a pantie sequence). That's why I'm only giving it an 8 but it's still well worth seeing.",8,1,5,8 February 2011
Gangs of New York," Hopeless
","Martin Scorsese once again does a period piece set in New York in 1862. Why? Wasn't 'Age of Innocence' bad enough?Story is supposed to be about a boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) out to avenge his fathers (Liam Neeson) death at the hands of William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). But the screenwriters try to shoehorn in every single event happening in NYC in the 1860s. There's abolition, the Union Army, the Draft Riots, bigotry, murder, immigrants, racism, robbery etc etc etc. It's too much for one movie to hold and most of it has precious little to do with the main story. More often than not I was confused and bored by these constant detours from the story. I twice considered walking out because I was so bored--a few people did leave.Also the dialogue in this movie is horrible--when you can understand it. Day-Lewis adopts a very strange annoying accent and DiCaprio unwisely tries to do an Irish accent (which comes and goes throughout the movie). Cameron Diaz as con artist Jenny Everdeane wisely doesn't try. As for the acting....weellllllll...what can you say about a movie where DiCaprio gives the best performance? He's lousy but he's better than anybody else. Day-Lewis growls, yells and chews the scenery to a ridiculous degree and Diaz has the hopeless bad girl with the heart of gold role--she deserves much better than this.The movie is hellishly long at 2 hours and 45 minutes. It looks great but it's dull, badly written, badly acted, surprisingly badly directed and totally unfocused.A real disappointment. Probably Scorsese's worst film to date. One positive thing--if you're an insomniac this will put you to sleep!!!",1,5,24,6 January 2003
The Cabin in the Woods," WAY overpraised
","The steup is familiar--a bunch of college kids go to an isolated cabin in the woods. They are the familiar clichés--an oversexed jock (Chris Hemsworth), his sex-starved girlfriend (Anna Hutchison), his best buddy (Jesse Williams), a stoner (Fran Kranz) and a sweet girl (Kristen Connolly). They get there but are watched over by two mysterious men (Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins)--but why? I won't spoil it by revealing the twist.I had high hopes for this. It was praised to the high heavens by critics and the opening scenes at the cabin deliberately (I think) look just like the scenes at the cabin in 'The Evil Dead'. And (for once) we have good actors playing these clichés and good dialogue (with some humor that is actually pretty funny). But the fun quickly drains away. After you find out what is going on it stops being fun and just gets pretty sick and disturbing. The movie seems to think it's much cleverer than it actually is. This does NOT rewrite the horror genre like 'Scream' did in 1996 (although a lot of critics think it does). Also, for a film that seems to praise itself for being so clever, they throw in a REALLY pointless gratuitous topless nude scene which was NOT needed. It redeems itself somewhat towards the last section which gets REALLY REALLY gory and has a cameo by a respected actress (my audience laughed and applauded when she appeared) but it doesn't save the movie entirely. It's not a total loss--it's just not as clever as critics seem to think. ALL the acting is good and you care about the characters--but that's about it. I love horror movies but can only give this a 6.",6,12,27,14 April 2012
Windtalkers," Boring and clichéd
","In WWII Navajo men were used as code talkers in the war--they translated messages while in combat into their own language, and transmitted it that way. This was done so the Japanese were unable to understand the messages. It's a very interesting little known fact about the war. It's a good thing they made a movie about it--it's too bad the movie is so lousy.SPOILERSEvery single clichéd line and character found in WWII movies are all here. There's the sergeant who is suffering from a former war trauma; the eager young kid (who you know is gonna get it); the racist (who sees the error of his ways); the nice guy who is horrified by what he sees; the saint-like Navajos etc etc. The dialogue is astonishingly bad. I've heard these same lines from other war flicks--some of them are lifted verbatim (it seems)! Every single line and conflict is predictable. I was able to tell in the first 20 minutes who was going to die--that's how predictable this is! I almost left but the movie DOES have it's good points. For one thing, war is not glorified. The battle sequences are bloody, loud, very graphic and upsetting...as they should be. However, director John Woo has always been good at shooting violence. Also there's no stupid obligatory romance--heck, there's virtually no females here! There's some good acting also--Adam Beach as one of the Navajos is fantastic--handsome, intelligent if a little too saintlike. Mark Ruffalo is also affecting and Christian Slater (not playing a jerk for once) is excellent. Unfortunately, Nicholas Cage gives another lousy performance as the main character. Can we take back the Oscar he got for 'Leaving Las Vegas'?So, aside from some good acting and extreme violence (be warned...it's VERY explicit...some people walked out because of it), I can't recommend this. Too bad...the subject matter is so interesting.",5,10,17,5 July 2002
Happy Feet," I'm not sure how I feel about this
","Two penguins Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Dallas (Hugh Jackman) give birth to a baby called Mumble (Elijah Wood). According to this movie the penguins sing constantly (from 1950s to present day music) but Mumbles can't sing...but he CAN dance. However the tribal elders said his singing is evil and the reason their fish supply is dwindling, and he is banished. I could go on but basically you've seen this before...only with human beings. It's another story telling children that it's OK to be different and this one has an environmental message with it. There's nothing wrong with that (the kids in my audience were dead silent and seemed to love this) but I was unimpressed. The CGI was incredible, the songs were good and the voices matched the characters completely...but I didn't know how to take this movie. I mean when a bunch of penguin kids started singing 'In My Room' by the Beach Boys i didn't know how to respond. It wasn't funny, it wasn't cute, it was just...weird.SPOILERS AHEAD!!! There are also sequences where the penguins are attacked by other animals which might disturb real young kids. And Mumbles ends up in a zoo towards the end...and begins to go crazy. THAT'S for kids???? I found it disturbing and I'm an adult! END OF SPOILERS!!!!It does all end on a very happy but totally unbelievable note--even for a kids movie that end was pushing it. So I (sort of) liked it but it all left me kind of cold (no pun intended) and the movie slams you in the face with its message again and again. When you see a whole colony of penguins break-dancing and it's not funny (my audience was dead silent) something is wrong. The only real humor here was a bunch of penguins (with Spanish accents) which befriend Mumbles--they were absolutely hysterical.So kids will probably love this but adults should use caution. Some adult couples walked out of this when I saw it! I can only give it a 6--but put that rating higher if you're seeing it with kids.",6,2,5,16 December 2006
The Breakfast Club," Quite simply one of the best teen films of the 80s
","Five teenagers are assigned detention on a Saturday morning and afternoon. They are a jock (Emilio Estevez), a hood (Judd Nelson), a rich girl (Molly Ringwald), a geek (Anthony Michael Hall) and a basket case (Ally Sheedy). During the course of the detention (and with a little help from marijuana) they open up and talk and begin to know each other.A dead on target examination of teen life in 1984/85. This was a very challenging thing to do--release a film about teens just talking and relating to each other. It also was (unjustly) awarded an R rating for the frequent swearing--but that's how high schoolers talk!I was in college when this came out, but I saw it with a friend who was still in high school. According to him the movie got everything right--the clothes, dialogue, styles and music were accurate. He said it was one of the few movies that accurately showed how he felt. I felt the same way. I think any teenager can relate to this movie. The movie is somewhat unpleasant (some of the kids really attack each other verbally) but there's plenty of comedy mixed in too.The cast: Estevez (what ever happened to...) is just great as the jock. He gives a very believable and moving performance especially in a speech about his father. Nelson, however, is horrible as the hood. He looks the part but he's way too eloquent and his acting was pretty bad. Ringwald and Hall are perfect in their roles, but they WERE teenagers when this was filmed. Sheedy does what she can with a criminally underwritten role. John Kapelos (as a janitor) is hardly in it (I'm assuming his part was severely cut) and Paul Gleason (a good actor) is given a very 1-dimensional role--the evil adult. He does what he can with it.The movie isn't perfect--parents are the root of all the kids problems; there are annoying lapses in logic (like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention, so wouldn't Gleason know that) and there is a whole dance sequence squeezed in.Still--a truly great teenage movie. A definite must-see. A bonus is that the movie opens with one of the best songs of the 1980s (and a big hit)--Simple Minds 'Don't You Forget About Me'. This is rightfully considered a classic.'Who'd your mom marry--Mr. Rogers?' 'No--Mr. Johnson'",10,109,155,11 December 2002
Gladiator," Predictable, long, loud, bloody
","That about describes the movie...the plot is by the number, the movie is too long by about 1/2 hour, it's needlessly loud and it's very bloody (which is to be expected).  The only real reasons to see the film: Crowe's great performance (and body) even if he does slip into his Australian accent ocassionally and director Scott's incredible visuals.  Also worth seeing is Oliver Reeds' final performance (he's very good).  All the other acting is OK, but the story is just so drawn out and I was always one step ahead of it.  The fight scenes are incredible, but those sequences don't make up for the rest of the movie.  Wait for the video.",5,2,7,15 May 2000
Back to the Future," Shouldn't work...but it does
","HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won't exist. And how is he going to get back to 1985?Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like 'Footloose', 'Gremlins', 'Stand By Me' and into the 90s with 'Scream'). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with 'to be continued...') and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song 'The Power of Love'. And don't miss Lewis' cute cameo as a teacher at the beginning. I give this a solid 9.",9,6,8,29 July 2005
The Great Gatsby," Overdone, overlong and deadly dull
",This takes place in the 1920s. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) narrates it from a sanitarium. It's about Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is VERY wealthy and his obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan). The problem is she's married to someone else.The novel is great but this movie completely trashes it. It makes ill-conceived changes in the story and goes on far too long. Also it's WAY overdone. There are endless parties at Gatsby's mansion and they're shoved in your face nonstop. A few times I had to close my eyes because there was too much going on! I saw it in 2D--in 3D it must be impossible to watch. When it isn't in your face it's deadly dull and moves at a snails pace. To make matters worse Maguire is lousy. Totally blank-faced in his role. Mulligan (who can be good) was even worse! I never got a grasp on her character or motivations. On the other hand DiCaprio was great as Gatsby. He's grown into an amazing actor. Very good-looking too. But this movie is mostly concerned with visuals--not the story. It manages the impossible--it's boring and overdone at the same time! Read the book instead.,1,54,96,27 May 2013
The Proposal," Utterly predictable but it works!
","Mean, evil New York book editor Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is going to be sent back to Canada because her Visa has expired. She orders her assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to act like he's her boyfriend and has proposed to her. Naturally he hates her but goes along with it. They then go to Alaska to celebrate the 90th birthday of Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White). Three guesses what happens.Utterly predictable in terms of plot but this works beautifully! Bullock and Reynolds are both great actors, are incredibly good-looking and play off each other well (it helps that they're friends in real life). Reynolds downplays his role nicely and Bullock plays her part perfectly. They're helped by a script that is predictable but VERY funny. A sequence between Bullock, an eagle and an adorable little dog is hysterical! There's a strong supporting cast doing wonderfully--White is great as always and Mary Steenburgen is excellent as Reynold's mother. Oscar Nunez is great in multiple roles! Only Craig T. Nelson disappoints as Reynold's father.This is a chick flick that is utterly predictable but works every step of the way. Well done and entertaining. An 8.",8,1,6,4 July 2009

The attacks escalate and soon Mitch, Melanie and their friends are fighting against birds who attack and kill for no reason...Some of the dialogue is awkward and it goes on way too long but this is one of Hitchcock's most frightening films. It's beautifully shot and everything looks perfect. The only real debits are the length and Hedren's lousy acting (she was beautiful--but no actress). Taylor gives out a good performance and Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are excellent in strong supporting roles. Still, I have trouble watching this movie.I love horror films and pride myself on being able to sit through anything but I get horrified watching this film. Children are attacked twice--I seriously draw the line at films that have children being hurt. The sequences at the birthday party and (especially) the school (with the infamous jungle gym bit) are just harrowing. Seeing screaming children running in terror as birds peck at them them is not fun. But then it isn't supposed to be. Also Hedren being attacked is even worse. The poor actress had a bunch of birds tied to her by nylon rope--when the birds tried to fly away they couldn't and, naturally, attacked Hedren. They shot that for THREE DAYS until Hedren had a complete nervous breakdown. Knowing this makes the scene even harder to watch. And the discovery of Pleshette's body is hard too. Some people have complained that no reason was given for the birds attacking but seriously--what reason COULD they give?A strong, frightening film but one of Hitch's best horror films. Decidedly not for children.",9,31,60,18 October 2004
Princess Mononoke," Long, dull, badly dubbed
","THIS is one of the most popular Japanese movies of all time???!!! Yes, there's some excellent animation and enough plot for 7 films BUT, not all the animation is good, the plot isn't exactly interesting and gets real silly at times (I gave up when the tigers and boars started having conversations), and the film is WAY too long (130 minutes). Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation. Also there's some real gruesome violence, so this isn't exactly for the kids. A waste of time unless you're amine fan.",5,6,21,8 November 1999
The Wizard of Oz," Good FOR KIDS
","From when I was a little kid up through high school, I saw this on network TV. They showed it once a year somewhere around Easter. I remember loving the costumes, the colors and having the heck scared out of me by the flying monkeys. Seeing it again as an adult it, sadly, doesn't hold up.The plot is boring and has HUGE holes, the dialogue very childish (even for a kids movie) and the songs--some are great ('Over the Rainbow' of course) but others are horrendous ('King of the Forest'). On the plus side, seeing Judy Garland so young and full of life is fun and Haley and Lahr are very good as the Tin Man (what a soft, wonderful voice!) and the Lion (does anyone else realize he's gay?). Bolger, however, overacts dreadfully. Margaret Hamilton is very funny as the witch--what a laugh! And Billie Burke is a scream as Glinda--I just couldn't take the dress and her voice seriously--and her lines! ('Are you a good witch or a bad witch?' 'Only bad witches are ugly.' '...and Toto too') In fact, I saw it last night with an adult audience and they were howling at her lines. Also Frank Morgan is VERY good as the wizard. His giving the gifts at the end is a highlight. Good thing W.C. Fields didn't get the role--it wouldn't have worked.Also, the new print looks beautiful--sepia tones for the beginning and end and rich, beautiful color. But I was bored and the ending -- 'Oh Auntie Em, there's no place like home' PLEASE!!!!! She chooses boring, colorless Kansas over Oz? The plot holes and goofs also bothered me a lot--note how Garland's hair keeps changing.So, good for kids. Adults beware.",8,3,12,23 January 2002
Evil Dead II," Violent, gruesome, over the top, a GREAT movie!
","Nonstop fun as a group of people are trapped overnight in a remote cabin and tormented by the evil dead. Not really a sequel to 'The Evil Dead'--more of a remake. Director Sam Raimi expected this to be R rated and figured most people never saw the unrated (meaning it was X) first one. So, he decided to just redo the movie--just quicker, less gorier and with STRONG doses of comedy (the first one was dead serious). He did it, cut some gore but it was STILL unrated. So it was released (with the gore never put back in) and, like the first, didn't do too well. And, like the first, it quickly acquired a following and is now considered a great movie!Basically once the movie gets going it never stops. It's more a comedy than a horror movie--a very SICK comedy! Hands are cut off, eyeballs go flying, BUCKETS of blood are thrown around, knives and axes are used, etc. If you go expecting a horror film, you'll be disappointed. If you approach it as a sick comedy you'll love it! I recommend this highly but only if you have a strong stomach!The sequence with Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his possessed hand is a horrific and comedic highlight. Cool ending too.",10,83,115,1 November 1999
The Godfather," A masterpiece
","Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines ('I'll make him an offer he can't refuse') have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.",10,2,2,22 April 2019
