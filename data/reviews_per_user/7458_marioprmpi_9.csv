First Man," Pioneering cinema! - not a hero story, but the portrait of a sensitive man and the history about reaching the greatest triumph of humanity
","Positive:
<ul><li>the authentic and exciting realism reflects the hellish danger and let's you experience how it must have felt, to be there yourself right in the middle of the action</li><li>shows the boundless sense of duty, scientific curiosity and ambition of Neil Armstrong</li><li>extremely entertaining</li><li>spectacular optics</li></ul>Negative:
<ul><li>simply simulated lunar surface</li></ul>",9,0,2,13 April 2020
Mission: Impossible III," No benchmark for James Bond...
","Positive:
<ul><li>Ethan Hunt has humanity (love, suffering, fear, failure)</li><li>hard &amp; fast action</li><li>Philip Seymour Hoffman as villain</li><li>sporadic humor</li></ul>Negative:
<ul><li>excessive action that prevents you from getting involved in the personal level of the movie</li><li>poor script; the anticipatory intro, in which his wife is 'massacred', puts the film rather in a dark mood, instead of building tension and is resolved in the end again by the MI classic mask trick</li><li>simple-minded/less creative story; his wife is abducted and he must try to rescue her + obligatory mole side story</li><li>lack of 'uniqueness' (except for the meanwhile exhausted mask trick); It misses interesting/accessible team members and the 'impossible mission', which must be mastered by sophistication &amp; technical equipment</li></ul>",6,1,1,14 November 2019

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Entertaining & fascinating CGI adventure from the Harry Potter universe

<ul><li>devious but still little innovative villain who mainly appears as functional instrument</li></ul>",10,0,1,14 April 2020
Creed II," Not a dull brawl movie, but a direct hit! (in the truest sense of the word)
","Positive:
<ul><li>entertaining &amp; thrilling</li><li>successful transfer of the conflict of the earlier generation</li><li>unexpectedly ambivalent and sophisticated narrative and complex characters for a Hollywood sports film + some outstanding 'drama' moments that benefit the film and elevate it beyond a mere sports film</li><li>Michael B. Jordan has now become a superstar and shows his entire range of acting</li></ul>Negative:
<ul><li>despite a certain degree of independence from the predecessor(s), it's not a really new concept and therefore somewhat predictable</li><li>boxing scenes not bad, but also not outstanding</li></ul>",8,0,0,13 April 2020
