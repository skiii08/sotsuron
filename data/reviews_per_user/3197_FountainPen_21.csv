Insidious: Chapter 2," Minimally better than the very poor first film
","Here we go again! Dark scenes (saving on lighting electricity?), bad acting, lame direction, predictable scares, dopey-looking kid, dopey- looking father, petrified-looking mother, smart-alecky psychic investigators, and so on and so on. I wonder why this 'follow-up' flick was made, seriously. Why? It's not as though the first was a rip-roaring success, so, by public demand, here's number two. Yeah, number two, ha ha ha. Instead of Tip Toe Through The Tulips, this time we get Row Row Row Your Boat, Gently Down the Stream. Quite a hit parade. Oh Dear! This DVD movie was part of a large bulk lot I bought at a bargain- basement price, so I can't complain about financial loss, and I watched it while fiddling around on the Internet, so no real time loss. Just my sad disappointment that this could not have been a LOT better than the first movie. After all, lessons could/should have been made, right? Sorry I cannot recommend this movie.",4,1,2,22 September 2017
Child 44," Dark, Dismal, Dumb, Disjointed, Disappointing
","3 out of 10 is the best I can do for this unfortunate film. As with many movies over the past 20 years, almost all scenes appear to have been shot with the camera's lens closed down a number of stops, thereby producing a dark, dark scene & atmosphere, hardly ever actually called for by activity. Granted, the subject matter is dark and nasty, but that is no excuse for continual scenes in which we can barely make out faces even. Bad, bad, bad !Further, much of the audio is difficult to follow, owing in part to mumbled lines, contorted accents, plus interfering background effects & music. I had expected a powerful film with excellent cinematography, but instead was presented with this lemon. Unfortunate. Not recommended.",5,0,1,22 October 2017
In Bruges," Worthless
","If you can manage to understand the extreme Irish accents, you may be able to make a tiny bit of sense out of this stupid film. I had to keep the subtitles on ~ bought the flick in a large bulk load of DVDs on eBay, for a pittance, so am not regretting my microscopic financial loss. The two leading characters in this abortion appear as grossly retarded beings. The pace is dreadfully s--l--o--w, pitifully so, excruciating. Attempts at humour are frequent but fail awfully. All in all, I just do not know how this movie could possibly have gained a rating just short of 8 on the InterNetMovieDataBase. Plainly ridiculous. The cast & crew must have a huge pile of friends out there. NOT RECOMMENDED ~ do anything else instead !",1,1,9,26 October 2017
Memento," so-so movie, nothing special, of no real importance 4/10
","Reviewer 'lasher42' rates this film 10/10. Always suspicious of 8/10, 9/10 and especially 10/10 ratings for so-so movies, I checked the history of 'lasher42' and find that he/she has REVIEWED a total of only TWO motion pictures !! 
A joke. And he/she spells SCENE as SEEN. Hmmm. 
So WHY did he/she rate this film 10/10 ? A cast member? A crew member? 
A friend or relative of a cast or crew member? I don't know, but I am growing more and more teed-off at such 'reviewers'. A waste of time. Are they kids? 
This is a so-so movie. I rate it 4/10 as it is not particulary well-acted or well-directed and the story is somewhat lame. The cinematography is OK.",4,1,3,24 February 2018
Shakespeare in Love," 5/10 is the best I can give after decades of watching movies
","'sofyarozy89' gave this film 9/10. Suspicious as usual, I checked this person's review history and found that he/she has reviewed ~~ you guessed it!! ~~ ONLY this ONE movie. Therefore, be on your guard against 8/10, 9/10, and 10/10 for ANY movie !
This picture is OK, nothing special, slow at times, the guy is not so good, the gal is better. Costumes and scenery lovely. NOT memorable !",5,2,6,23 February 2018
Elizabeth," Oh Dear ! Hollywood's idea of British history again !
","Yes, here we go again ! Hollywood hard at work putting its skew on British history. You can hear the American accents in this effort. Overall, the film is quite good, but it is NOT true to history, which MUST be taken into account. Children in particular (and viewers looking for a history lesson), need to be aware that this is a kind of partial-imaginary, made up, fictional version of the reign of Queen Elizabeth the First. It is a great shame that movie-makers, in particular those in Hollywood, will not stay with the known FACTS. 
I prefer Cate Blanchett as QE, rather than the vastly over-used and over-rated Helen Mirren (who apparently was given a Damehood for portraying both Elizabeths: silly). 
In my book, this flick rates 6/10, and while it is NOT 'film perfection', I can recommend it ~ but ralways bear in mind that it is NOT true history and the script should have been so much better.",6,1,2,17 February 2018
Zodiac," Tries hard but fails.
","My number one question is WHY was Gyllenhaal cast in the lead? He's extremely ineffectual, mealy-mouthed, delivers his lines in an irritatingly mumbling, raspy manner. 
Next is the matter of the music chosen for various segments: totally inappropriate. OK, the songs are from the right time period, but they simply do not connect with what's on screen in most instances. 
I sincerely wanted to 'enjoy' and appreciate thisfilm, but I was thwarted, sadly. 
The players try hard, but fail. At least this movie was not shot in near-darkness as many films of the past 30 years have been, oddly. Is lighting too expensive? 
Sorry I cannot rate this higher than 4.",4,1,3,30 December 2017
Silent Hill," Boring, dull CG FX, easily forgettable effort
","Sorry, fans of the computer game, but this is clearly one that did NOT adapt well to being made into a movie. Why game makers seem to think any old game will transfer well, I do not know.At two hours and five minutes it is far too long for a flick that depends on one main theme, dismal cinematography, barely adequate 'acting' and very standard SFX. The creatures were the usual beasts-from-hell, straight out of the digital version of Central Casting. Uninspiring, insipid. What did I like about this flop? Well, the big sign saying 'Welcome to Silent Hill' was pretty good.NOTE: I see loads of people on IMDB giving this rubbish 8, 9 or 10... these are members who have a list of only ONE or VERY FEW viewed and reviewed movies! In other words, they are people who have joined just to give this snotty film a high rating. There ought to be some procedure to prevent such abuse. I have noted it time after time with lousy flicks. For example, for this movie, 'Silent Hill':
10/10
Silent hill isn't a horror movie its a nightmare drama

Shutter Island," Slow, boring, pretentious, pointless, mind-numbing !
","Why on earth did Scorsese get involved with this giant clunker? It is a dreadful exercise in movie-making, based on a badly-written, poorly- thought-out story line. There is no clever aspect, nothing of the sort that made Hitchcock so great.The actors do the best they can -- I guess -- with this film which has a feeling of decadence and doom about it. The ending is a blessed relief. I enjoyed the clothes, the props, the car that was blown up, so I cannot rate it zero. One out of ten is the best I can do. Give this bomb a miss. Don't be persuaded by anyone that it is an intellectual treat: no, it is simply a flop with a few big names in it.",1,3,7,1 March 2016
Pitch Black," Irritating, boring, noisy, worthless, nothing to recommend it !
","I know it's 'stylish' to like and praise the 'actor' Vin Diesel but this flick is just a mess with or without him. It started out with a voice-over that I could not understand: mumbled, low speech that was unclear. The titling was in a typeface very difficult to read. The sound effects were loud and noisy, over-blown, accompanied by flashing lights in an apparent attempt to impress (ho-hum). The photography is silly, presumably the director was trying for some kind of imagined artistic effect. Looked as though he'd used the wrong kind of film stock and/or put incorrect filters on the camera lens. Forget 'acting', what a shambles! Complete waste of time, so no point in my commenting on the 'story line'. I think I'd rather watch 'Gigli' again than see this movie once more.",1,7,14,24 December 2006
The Alamo," The Battle of San Jacinto was the main event !
","It comes down to about 15 minutes (out of 2 hours, 17 minutes), featuring the folk-hero Davy Crockett. Everything before is a somewhat laborious and, frankly, oft-times plain boring, build-up to the main event in this much-repeated story of what is always touted as a supreme example of extreme bravery and patriotism in the face of overwhelming odds. Yes, bravery. We are left with the great slogan and rallying battle cry 'Remember The Alamo'. This is the key to the big picture. Mexican General Santa Anna realized the futility of what the Texans were doing at 'The Alamo', as a one-time event. He had to take a firm stand for his country. 'Without tears, there is no glory'. We, as moviegoers, as the viewers of this historical re-enactment, are sitting there, waiting to witness the bloody outcome, the carnage, the vainglory, the posturing. As this production of 'The Alamo' indicates, we need to look upon 'The Alamo' as inspiration for 'The Battle of San Jacinto' which sealed independence for Texas against the Mexicans, with the decimated army of American General Sam Houston demolishing General Santa Anna's beautifully-tailored, arrogant, well-supplied forces. 'The Battle of San Jacinto' is not a kind of footnote to 'The Alamo'. San Jacinto was the main event.",4,0,0,28 December 2016
Before Sunset," I mean, y'know ~~~ what a pretentious flick !
","Ethan Hawke comes across as an unattractive, total idiot in this pathetic film. Why he hasn't had his teeth fixed, I do not know. His speech is punctuated with 'I mean', 'Y'know' and similar interjections so popular with the lazy-speaking pretentious Hollywood set, and hardly worthy of a supposed top author. His girlfriend is an irritating, smiley-smiley waif, probably well-matched with him, frankly. Together, they are nauseating beyond belief. She is the sort of gal who begins sentences with 'So'. Ughhh! Definitely NOT recommended.",1,1,5,29 October 2017
Meet Joe Black," Draggy, draggy, draggy...
","The opening almost caused me to turn this movie off. So boring, long, draggy, oh dear, oh dear! You'd think that a film starring the great Anthony Hopkins and the popular Brad Pitt would be marvellous, but it is NOT. And the gal cast as Hopkins' 'beautiful' daughter is dreadful, irritating and annoying. How could such a mis-casting take place in 1998? Were there no other candidates? SO MANY times during this picture, I found myself yelling 'Get on with it!'. So often it ground almost to a halt, seemed like a rehearsal with all parties hung over. Anthony Hopkins has certainly refined to a fine art, the skill of s-p-e-a-k-i-n-g s-l-o-w-l-y. Overall, this movie has some merit, but far, far less than it should have had. A major disappointment.",4,4,8,5 November 2017
Children of Men," Mixed feelings about this very unusual motion picture. 5/10
","MAJOR SPOILER AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW! 
An important supporting role in this movie is played by Michael Caine, born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, England, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. 
Now he's 'Sir', but from what a very close friend of mine experienced about 30 years ago, Caine is far from a gentleman. 
My friend was waiting for a train on a station platform in Sussex, England, when he spotted Caine walking along by himself. He went up to Caine and addressed him politely simply to say hello. Caine INCORRECTLY assumed my friend was seeking an autograph and said sternly 'Ahm not signin' any or...'. 
My friend quickly assured him he was NOT looking for a signature, Caine replied 'Ah, good'. A few moments later a young boy approached Caine and DID ask for his autograph; Caine rudely refused, very visibly upsetting the lad who went back to his parents, clearly distressed. 
It was, therefore, with some astonishment that I saw this unusual movie 'Children of Men' begin with a person of world-wide fame being KILLED because he refused a request for an autograph! 
The movie is a one-off, very intense, disturbing, creative, but doesn't quite come off. The storyline premise is fascinating, there are many compelling scenes, but the violence is over-the-top (unrealistic gun battles), and some scenes are too drawn-out. The film cannot be termed 'entertainment' in my view; it's not a documentary; perhaps it's just what it seems ~ a harsh concept of a potential future world in which women can no longer become pregnant, for your intellectual pondering. 5/10.",5,0,3,28 February 2018
Big Fish," Fantastic piece of rubbish...
","HOW can a film with so many top stars result in such a piece of garbage? The answer seems to be by entering the world of 'fantasy' where anything is possible, where pseudo-intellectuals abound, where cinematic mistakes can be explained away as 'poetic licence', where everybody pats everybody else on the back, saying 'Ain't we done well?'. Where a proper storyline is passé, where pretty much anything goes in the name of 'art'. Honestly! This movie is a bunch of bits'n'pieces that start nowhere and go nowhere. There is nothing to recommend it; those who do are fooling themselves. Thank goodness I did not pay to see this motion picture. That is the only positive thing I can say about it. Why all these actors agreed to their roles, I cannot imagine, other than they thought they were hitching a ride on the coat tails of a flavour-of-the-month director. Tsk Tsk Tsk",1,4,9,22 December 2016
Mission: Impossible," Boring, Loud & Silly
","Childish presentation, boring in parts, very silly overall, noisy irritating soundtrack, unnecessarily long scenes, strange direction techniques, very few real thrills, a lot of hype -- and I never realized what an ENORMOUS nose Tom Cruise has! Maybe that's why one of the female leads also has a giant schnozzle! The film was a gross disappointment, though I guess die-hard Cruise fans will eat it up. Any comparison between this effort and the TV series is virtually pointless, as the TV shows were fast, exciting, clever, superbly-directed, full of suspense, with a lot of sharp dialogue, and actors who were true craftsmen. Sorry, but this flick is a real bummer!",1,14,25,23 March 2006
Defiance," Sadly lacking in all areas, a poor attempt
","What was the director thinking, really? I believe he made so many fundamental errors that it is hard to accept from an apparently seasoned professional. Must say this is more the part that Daniel Craig fits into, than James Bond which requires a smooth, suave man. The rough'n'tumble and craggy old Craig indeed looks the part in this flick, though his acting is lacking, lightweight, unconvincing. The whole movie has a feeling of failure about it. One series of scenes involving violent blood & shooting action was ridiculously handled, almost in a Keystone Kops fashion. I couldn't figure out why the characters were speaking Russian, when the film is set in Poland. Who knows? Does the director? Do the actors? Really, a waste of time, but I have resisted rating lower than 3 out of respect for the events portrayed, even though they were portrayed poorly.",3,0,1,14 November 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Wonderfully crafted motion picture with wide appeal
","THIS is what movies are all about! A magnificent story, first-class actors, a superbly talented director, plus all the necessary attendant and supporting talents including set design, lighting, music, scripting, and all else that is required in the mix to create a masterpiece. Not a moment of the film is wasted, no segment too short or too long: it is all 'just right'. Who would have thought that a story about men in a cruel prison system could be developed into a memorable movie with many marvellous messages. May I single out one of my favourite actors, James Whitmore? I cannot imagine anyone else more suited to the role than he. In fact, the casting in this epic is remarkable: all parts ideally filled with class actors. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, is not one of my screen favourites, but it's impossible to find any fault with him, and somehow he puts his mark on the role and makes it his. Tim Robbins is perfect; each time I see this film, I appreciate his acting more and more. It's so easy to give Shawshank Redemption a TEN. Surely anything less would be an injustice? Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus !",6,0,1,16 November 2017
Prometheus," Bad casting, too long, great idea messed up !
","The Captain and the scientist Elizabeth Shaw were mis-cast. Idris Elba trying to play a Southern black was laughable, pathetic, and his part contributed next to nothing to the storyline. The female scientist was immensely annoying, yelled and screamed a lot, very unattractive, came across as a tradityional sterotyped hysterical woman, sorry. 
The movie just went on and on and on; At 1 hour 35 minutes I was praying for it to end VERY SOON! Cinematrography was excellent, most special effects very professionally done. The android character David (Michael Fassbender) was terrific ~ now that's acting! Charlize Theron did a great job, too, in a very difficult part. Smaller roles well-handled. 
Btw, it was very easy to anticipate the big surprise regarding the guy who had financed the trillion-dollar venture! 
Had the film been one hour 30 minutes, I would probably have awarded 6/10, but as it is, 4/10 is the maximum I can manage, and sci-fi is one of my most favourite genres.",4,1,3,16 February 2018
The Producers," Marvellous, entertaining, brilliant, wondeerful... SEE IT !!
","This motion picture scores 100% or very close to it on all points. The casting of Wilder and Mostel was perfection. Even the small and tiny roles were cast with inspiration. See it, and see it again and again and again, as I have done for 50 years. 
Without question, one of THE best films of the 1960s and even of the 20th century.",10,0,2,20 February 2018
Godzilla," Disappointing ~ could have been FAR better especially in 2014 !
","Yet again, some people are ruining the reviewing/rating system by popping in to give a 10/10 rating and a superlative review, then disappearing into the woodwork. Are such people cast or crew members? Or this friends and relatives? Whatever, I wish they would STOP it ! Roll on the day when there are only HONEST reviews on the IMDb. 
One typically suspect review is headed 'Godzilla - The TRUE King of the Monsters is born... ' and was submitted by 'purenxk' who has reviewed ONLY this one movie ! 
I found this attempt at GODZILLA to be mildly entertaining, with some fine effects, BUT I expected much more in 2014. The movie was severely dragged down by a silly 'lovematch' early on, particularly as the girl is so unappealing and speaks in a mumble !! 
Probably worth seeing if you've nothing better to do, but nothing special. 
5/10 and that's my HONEST opinion.",5,0,0,27 February 2018
