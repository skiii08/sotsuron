Catch Me If You Can," Much better than I thought it would be
","I had passed by 'Catch Me If You Can' a number of times at the video rental place before finally grabbing it this weekend.  From the ads I had seen for it when it first came out, I figured it would be kind of shallow, boring, 'family' entertainment.  I stand humbled and corrected.I have a new appreciation for DiCaprio as an actor now, although his performance isn't Oscar-worthy, it is pretty damn good.  Tom Hanks is OK, although I still can't quite figure out (a) what that accent is he's using (Boston?) and (b) where is he stationed?  That seemed the biggest continuity problem to me.  At first he seems like he's in New York or Washington, then maybe Atlanta, who knows?  Minor point, however.Spielberg does a great job telling this story and making you actually care about the characters; my only beef is that I think he could have explored Carl's family situation a little more.  I can see why he didn't, however, and, frankly, it doesn't distract from the movie too much.  I would give this a 10, but Spielberg must still pay penance for that horrendous 'A.I.'",9,1,2,28 June 2003
Being John Malkovich," Good, but the ending seemed muddled
","This is definitely one of the more original movies of the past ten years; it starts off very strong, but it seems to be that they just weren't really sure how (or when) to end it.  I think the comedic possibilities of people 'visiting' Malkovich could have been explored more and made this a much funnier movie.",8,0,1,27 June 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Nothing good ever dies...
","What an amazing movie.  The performances, even by the bit players, are fantastic, the story is wonderful, the mood is great...this is about as close as you can get to a perfect film.  The fact that Steven King wrote it makes it all the more amazing.Although one might be tempted to think of this as a prison movie, it's not; it's about hope and redemption.  The hope is embodied in Tim Robbins' character (Andy); the redemption in Morgan Freeman, Red (whose redemption comes as a result of Andy's hope).",10,0,0,27 June 2003
Gangs of New York," A bit pretentious, but very good
","'Gangs of New York' is a very powerful film about events in American history that we usually don't learn about: the absolute squallor of the poor sections of cities, the hate which met immigrants as they left the boats, and very widespread opposition to the Civil War, especially amongst those poor who could not afford to buy their way out of the draft.Unfortunately, it's a Scorsese film, so we have to sit through sequences that could have been done shorter and still conveyed the same meaning and power, we have to sit through plenty of pretentious garbage (although here it's not that awful), and far too many sweeping shots of, well, everything. Don't get me wrong, Scorsese's talented, I just get tired of his style sometimes.The performances are good; Daniel Day-Lewis is just incredible as the cold-blooded Bill the Butcher.  DiCaprio and Diaz do well, although their Irish accents are questionable most of the time (Diaz's especially).  I was far more impressed by the supporting cast, which moved in and out of each scene beautifully.Overall, you should definitely check this movie out.  Be warned though: one, it is very violent, and two, you are going to see a very realistic portrayal of the poor in the 19th century, and it isn't a bunch of loveable scamps like you see in most movies.",8,0,0,19 July 2003
