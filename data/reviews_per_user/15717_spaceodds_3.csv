Mission: Impossible III," A mission you should accept
","After the disastrous M:I-2 (a film that, along with Die Another Day, nearly ended the spy genre) scepticism was clouding my judgement since what was the point about doing another M:I movie. After hearing reports about the delay in production and the change in director, I started to think that Cruise maybe actually doing something special and after seeing the final product I can safely say that I got more than I expected.M:I-3 has really hit the nail when it comes to summer blockbuster since they took the already used formula and gave it a new and more fast paced look. Although the film took certain elements from films such as True Lies and certain James Bond video game, I cannot exactly cry plagiarism. Although the film has many fantastical gadgets and over the top scenes, J.J Abrams has fleshed out a good solid blockbuster that will wow audiences of any age and he even adds a character development to the film something that John Woo apparently forgot.Overall this is pure entertainment that will grab the attention of anyone. Although this movie will not exactly set the spy genre on fire, unlike the Bourne franchise, it will certainly leave appetite for more movies. M:I-4 let it roll",9,3,6,4 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Harry Potter and The Goblet of Boredom
","At last the best book in the series gets onto the big screen. Was it worth the wait; No! It was a waste of time, I wish I could get my two and half hours back. The film leaves out all the great scenes in the novel and presents us with a film a ten year old made on his IMac. The acting however is great however miscast should be the word used to describe it. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, is not right for Voldermort. He in my opinion is too nice. If it wasn't for JK Rowlings stance on an all British/European Cast, the character would have been greatly realised. In my opinion either John Malkovich or Willen Dafoe would have been amazing in the role. Miranda Richardson, despite giving a great performance as Rita Skeeter, is just too pretty for the role. If you grew up in England during the 1980s, many would know that Richardson was a pin up, and in my POV still is. Brendon Gleeson however is perfect casting for Moody, he has the appearance and the behaviour. I hope he continues. As for the kids, Radcliffe gets worse as time goes on. Whilst Watson and Grint have 'Wasted Talent' written over their CV's, I hope they leave the Hogwarts set and enlist in another production. Robert Pattison as Cedric Diggory surprised me with his performance, shame he isn't younger cause he would be fantastic for the Harry Potter role. Whilst Katie Leung as Cho Chang is beyond description since she is rarely seen, also she's annoying. Overall this film lacked all the imagination that made the book great. Not recommended for either HP fans nor for the uninitiated.",1,10,19,18 November 2005
Casino Royale," Bond is back with a vengeance
","After the disaster that was Die Another Day, Casino Royale has taken an altogether different root. The gadgets are gone and instead it is replaced by brains and wit. But most of all gone is Brosnan.Finally after decade of suffering with his arrogance and so called 'charm' we are introduced to Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond and I can safely say that he is worth every ounce of respect and praise he has recently received from film critics. Craig plays Bond as ruthless cold hearted assassin who is not afraid of the consequences. However he also demostrates Bond's vulnerability and innocence when it comes to true love. Talking of which Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is one of the most beautiful and probably the most interesting Bond girl ever. Her performance is not limited to only being a squeeze for Bond, the scenes she performs with Craig are absolutely perfect from their hillirious first conversation through to the romantic scenes are just pure platonic.The film itself is a joy from start to finish. From the minute the film began to roll, I was on the edge of my seat. The film is filled with great albeit few action sequences that can wet the appetite of any action fan, however my personal favourite scenes are the actual 'Casino Royale' scenes. The exchange between Craig's Bond and Mikkelsen's Le Chifre are by far one of the most suspenseful eschanges I've seen in film this year. I will not go into to much detail regarding the torture scene apart from the fact that Craig plays the scene with bravardo.Overall Casino Royale is a must see for everyone, Bond fan or not.",10,0,2,16 November 2006
