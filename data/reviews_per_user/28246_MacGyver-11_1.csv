The Blair Witch Project," An Incomplete Project
","Sorry, but as much hype as I had heard to suggest that BWP was 'A Seriously Scary movie' was just not true - myself and my two companions were left wondering what could have led someone to believe that (1) this was a true story or (2) that this was a scary story.  Even if it were true -- a reputable filmmaker would have completed the story.  The movie felt incomplete - incomprehensibly slow and yet ending before the story ever got an opportunity to become seriously scary.  A problematic wrinkle was the use of the name of a real town here in Maryland, and real places, without any basis in fact, and without warning the town.  Burkittsville is now subject to vandalism and destruction of property.  It is outrageous that the BWP website continues to maintain the illusion that this is a true story.",1,0,2,31 July 1999
