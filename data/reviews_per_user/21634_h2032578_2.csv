Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Great movie!! Give us a sequel please!
","Now this movie is everything I was expecting it to be: Cool bloody action, great atmosphere, amazing visuals! The director Timur Bekmambetov did 'Wanted' before that and it totally shows.The movie did over 100 million $ worldwide and I hope they (=Fox) make a sequel to it. It's just great well-made entertainment and a lot of fun. Why the movie wasn't that big of a success in the US is just beyond me. But it was the same with Prince Of Persia: Great movie, no success in the US, but a big success overseas.. go figure!So Timur, please give us another one of Abe's adventures! I'm definitely up for it!",Null,1,2,12 October 2012
The Hunger Games," Warning: Shaky cam movie / bad camera work!
","I really have to warn people about the bad camera work in this movie: The camera shakes most of the time and, even more annoyingly, it is too much zoomed in in most of the scenes. There a very few totals in this movie. You can barely see whats going on. I was looking soo forward to this movie but the camera ruined the whole thing for me. Many people in the cinema had the same opinion about that.I wonder why Hollywood is still producing these idiotic shaky cam movies? I thought this was just an mid-2000s phase and the producers realized by now how super-annoying this 'style' really is. But apparently not! So dear producers, please re-release this movie with normal and proper camera work, then it'll be a pleasure to watch!",Null,0,2,15 August 2012
