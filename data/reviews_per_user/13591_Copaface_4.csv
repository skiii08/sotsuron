Requiem for a Dream," Shocking, terrifying and brutally honest.
","I had first heard about Requiem For A Dream on one of those top ten lists sites. It was ranked at number 7 in a list of disturbing films which instantly drew me in to a desire to watch it. The first thing that must be said about this film is that the acting is top notch. Now I am no fan of Jared Leto's. I abhor his band and I only watched American Psycho because I heard that he died in it. And after watching Scary Movie, I could never imagine Marlon Wayans succeeding in a serious movie role. But both of them proved me 100% wrong. After watching Requiem... I barely even want to touch a glass of alcohol again let alone any type of drugs. This film is incredibly, brutally honest in its portrayal of not only the drugs lifestyle but the fear of growing old alone. In steps the fantastic yet tragic performance of Ellen Burstyn as the lonely, elderly mother obsessed with a spam call telling her she will be on television. The last ten minutes of the film is the culmination of how devastating the effect of drugs can be as each of the characters suffer their own tragic fate.Definitely give this film a watch. It may just be life-changing.",9,1,2,5 August 2009
Watchmen," A respectable effort.
","Okay... Watchmen... Read the book and freaking adored it. After reading, I was sceptical of how it could translate onto film. Admittedly part of me (the immature part) only wanted to see the film through a twisted desire to see a big blue ding dong on screen.All in all, the film wasn't a total disappointment but it wasn't utterly groundbreaking. Just a good effort. I thought the actors were cast really well and the soundtrack was, for lack of a better word, sick! Some of my favourite songs of all time, Sound Of Silence and Hallelujah. However I didn't like the fact that Hallelujah was played during the needlessly long and uncomfortable sex scene. I genuinely pitied my friend, who had to sit through said sex scene with her father right next to her.The book was a lot deeper and generally better but the film was worth a watch.PS - The big blue ding dong was a letdown...",8,0,3,13 August 2009
Twilight," Words can't describe how bad this movie is.
","I am an 18 year old girl so unfortunately I am stuck with a lot of people who are obsessed with this silly little Twilight thing. After attempting to read the book (and giving up halfway through over how poorly written and plagiarised the story is) I thought maybe I'd give the film a try hoping it would be better. Now I have never walked out of a movie before but I discarded my popcorn and stormed out of the cinema in disgust after half an hour.Not only does this completely take a huge dump all over everything that is cool about vampires but it has practically destroyed the lives of the actors. If only somebody had told them what they were getting into before they signed up to be in this film. Both Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart have been repeatedly harassed by the idiotic and overly annoying behaviour of the stupid fans. I genuinely pity anybody involved in this movie. I pity even more those who enjoyed it. If you enjoyed this movie/book, you obviously have no idea what good literature or good film-making is and are seriously deprived.As a My Chemical Romance fan, I am thoroughly insulted by the fact that Stephenie Meyer says she was inspired by them. So as you can imagine, I practically had orgasms out of joy when MCR turned down the 'opportunity' to record the theme for New Moon. Basically put, I would rather have my intestines ripped out through my mouth than hear another thing about Twatlight/Twishite or any of it's terrible sequels. Simply the brain child of a silly repressed mormon and her wet dream.",1,9,12,13 August 2009
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Not exactly what I'd call art but important nonetheless.
","I, like most people, have quite an opinion on what is art & what isn't and this film generally doesn't come under my personal art category but that's just an opinion. I do however think this film is important & by all mean it should have been made. Yes there are the few who will see it as just some form of torture porn... some may even get off on it if certain circling internet videos are to be believed... but I am interested in the opinions of those who view Salo the way I do. Torture, slavery & sexual degradation have been happening for thousands and thousands of years & continues to happen to this day (rape, child pornography, human trafficking etc.) and I believe that in order to fully understand things of this nature (and perhaps one day getting round the stopping them when certain governments pull their finger out) films like this are necessary. It not only shows you the vile truth of sex slavery but shows the extent to which people seem to get into their acting: it must have been extremely difficult for the actors to perform in some of the scenes (those who have seen the film will know all too well what I'm talking about). In some cases, it takes the point to be thrust full force & uncensored into someone's face for them to get it but if that was the whole point of the film I can only say mission accomplished. Back to the earlier point I personally wouldn't call it an art film but I do believe it is a film that should be seen.PS - To those who are fully traumatized by this film: I own the book. The book is worse.",7,0,1,11 January 2010
