The Blair Witch Project," This movie is used as a torture device!!!
","THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL BEYOND WORDS! It was not scarry in anyway and the movie almost made me throw up because of the camera bouncing up and down...to tell the truth alot of people went the the ticket window and got thier money back!If you are being forced to watch this movie, do what most people did, run for the razors! I give this movie a 1/10 ONLY because 0 is not an option.",1,3,5,20 April 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," OBVIOUSLY ONE OF MY FAVE MOVIES OF ALL TIME!
","Seth and Richard Gecko have murdered 16 people and took one lady hostage...they get the ransom money and try to think of a plan to get to Mexico so they wont have to worry about going to prison. They cant think of a good plan so they hijack a small family's motor home to get to mexico...when they get there they have to meet at a bar called the 'TITTY TWISTER' to wait for thier friend Carlos! While waiting for Carlos, they find out that all the employees and strippers at the bar are vampires.... The Gecko's fight like hell to stay alive!This movie is full of gore and action....not to mention that the person who played 'Sex Machine' (Tom Savini) is famous for special effects and the make-up for MANY horror films!I also did not expect vampires in this movie at all...I thought it would be another cool hitman movie from Quentin Tarantino. I didnt realise Robert Rodriguez had anything to do with it,But after i found out, it explained alot of the movie. Cool movie but i prefer Terence Hill and Bud Spencer comedies. My Vote 8/10",Null,0,0,21 April 2000
