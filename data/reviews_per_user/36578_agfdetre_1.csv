Requiem for a Dream," A hammer blow.
","It is probably the most powerful film I've ever seen, really. I love the Darren Aronofsky's style and as I loved 'Black Swan' in the same way I loved 'Requiem for a dream'. The soundtrack is incomparable and is perfect for this film, I listened to it on my own for hours and hours. It accompany all the changes in the four main characters involving even more the helpless spectator in what he is watching. Many scenes are very strong and not all the people will digest them easily. In my opinion there aren't a lot of other things to say about it, just watch it! Only watching it you can totally understand what is the meaning of my review. Nothing to add.",10,0,1,18 April 2016
