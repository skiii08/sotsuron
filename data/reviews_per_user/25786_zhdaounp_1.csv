Conquest 1453," MY worst 162 minutes ever wasted :(
","highly biased and full of religious fanaticism.. No need to say historically incorrect (i'm a history post grad). These low IQ people are trying to glorify one of the saddest event of world history and the barbarianism like CONVERTING HAGIA SOPHIA CHURCH into a mosque, which cost us millions of lives in crusades and jihads.If you people want to see the justification of how the fore- fathers of AL-BAGHDADI & OSAMA BIN LADEN stained humanity. Go ahead and waste your time. At least you will get an idea from which sh**hole of history the AL QAEDA and ISIS terrorists get their inspiration. It is from where it all got started.PEACE FOR ALL :)",1,6,13,5 March 2015
