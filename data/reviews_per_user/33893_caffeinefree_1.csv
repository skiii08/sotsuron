3:10 to Yuma," Unbelievably bad western movie, I wasted my money based on IMDb reviews
","I really have no idea where you guys are coming from, but this was the worst western I've seen for the longest time. From the writing, to the overall plot, nothing worked at all for the viewer.SPOILER: Lets just begin by saying this movie was premised upon the basic good guy with issues against a bad guy with lots of issues. Ben Wade, bad guy, played by Russel Crowe, is a real bad dude that likes to leave a trail behind me for others to follow. Thats a stretch right there. He doesn't mind killing his own band of outlaws, but he leaves a pinkerton man alive and challenges him to follow him again and again. Finally Wade is caught, now to get him to justice, whereupon 12 men die trying to get him to the jail to hang him. They even team up with him to fight the Indians and to fight even fight other pinkertons who want to kill him right now. So the entire plot is just stupid. For God's sake, somebody put a bullet between his eyes, and the story is over. But no, instead, lets drag it out and have Wade escape a few times, then allow a dozen good men to die while he is recaptured over and over again. I don't know how they could have made the story more unbelievable.",1,9,17,13 January 2008
