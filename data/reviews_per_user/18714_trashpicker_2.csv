Requiem for a Dream," Delicious Agony
","As a connisseur of heroin literature and film, I found Requiem to be an explosive telling of a story oft repeated: addiction & loss. From Drugstore Cowboy, Rush, Trainspotting, Naked Lunch & Junkie, the story is generally the same - vulnerable folks get pulled in by the most addictive drug known to man: heroin. But Requiem does more, goes further, and drives the viewer into the depths of the spiral unlike any film before. I found the last ten minutes of the film to be gut-wrenchingly painful as each character reached the nadir of their existence. Aronofsky's achievement with his filmmaking and the actors' achievement with their performances is truly amazing.",10,0,1,16 July 2002
Love Actually," Trite, predictable and excessively sappy.
","My wife and I rented this a couple of days ago and we both found the movie to be embarrassingly bad, and actually painful to watch in moments. While I think the cast is excellent and the acting is generally good, the inclusion of tired plot devices and ill-conceived plotlines (such as the PM's public tirade against the President because of jealousy) really destroys any potential it may have had. Richard Curtis' sappy Disney-esque moments don't help lend the movie any credibility, either. I think one of the most telling things I saw on the DVD was the 'Deleted Scenes' section where Curtis talks about how difficult it was to cut the movie down from 3+ hours to the 2+ hours it eventually became. Curtis takes almost 5 minutes discussing the import of each scene before the scene is played (some scenes are less than 2 minutes), and he is really excruciating to watch. If you were to believe him, each scene is a gem and should have made it to the final product. I beg to differ. The end result would have been a 3 hour mess as opposed to the 2 hour mess that we have been subjected to.Best avoided.",5,1,2,1 June 2004
