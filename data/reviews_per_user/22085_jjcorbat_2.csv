The Blair Witch Project," Left you hanging...
","I expected so much more of this movie.Yes, it was realistic.  Yes, you feel like you are in the actors shoes (boots).  Yes, the film crew did a superb job of making you think that it was totally filmed & recorded by the 3 actors.The big disappointment is that time after time you are prepared to be frightened and then nothing happens.  Finally in the last moments of the film there is reprieve from this monotonous cycle, but it's too little and too late.Other than the frequent swearing, I can't figure out why this movie was rated R.  I have heard others report this film as one of the scariest they have seen.  If this is the case, they have been watching too many Disney films.I haven't seen '6th Sense' yet, but I'm told that it is truly scary.  Save your 'Blair' money and see this movie instead.",4,0,2,16 August 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Be prepared to be shocked...
","Even though you watch South Park every week, own the tapes, etc. none of this can prepare you for what you will see on the big screen.  What really emphasized this was the fact that people got up and left the theatre during the middle of the show (they did not return).  I guess this movie '...warped their fragile little minds!' I laughed so hard that I cried, and this continued throughout most of the show.  Parker & Stone rarely gave you a chance to breathe.  I know I missed some of the jokes & obscenities because I was laughing so hard.I was especially impressed by the special effects like the various scenes involving fire and flames.  The fire seemed real...almost three dimensional amongst the other plain 2-D objects on the screen.  Also, the demons from hell were really wicked looking.Hopefully, the VHS version is not far away.  Maybe just in time for Christmas.  It will make a wonderful stocking stuffer for my Grandma!!! <<<LOL>>>",10,0,0,6 September 1999
