Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Sorry folks, this one is dog.
","Don't waste your time; go see 'The Matrix'.  I saw the first three 'Star Wars' movies as originals in various theaters multiple times and I was thoroughly satisfied and captivated.  Considering the amount of hype preceeding this movie, it was destined to make a lot of money, but leave the 'Star Wars' afficianado wondering what all the uproar was about.  And embarrassed to say it wasn't up to par.  For those who disagree with me, more power to you.  The worst scifi movie is still better than the best of all other types.  :-)",Null,0,1,26 October 1999
The Matrix," A real winner for all SciFi fans, especially those into VR
","If you're a SciFi VR enthusiast, DON'T miss this movie! It's got everything you'll want: great story line, excellent special effects, wonderfully developed characters, and an ending that will both satisfy and leave you wanting more. If you enjoy this sort of thing, be sure and read Jack L. Chalker's three book series 'The Wonderland Gambit' and Robert Charrette's 'ShadowRun' books. A great deal of the story in this movie was lifted from these books; all are excellent SciFi and drama.",10,0,0,26 October 1999
