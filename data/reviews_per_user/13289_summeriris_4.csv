The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Politics, politics.
","War movies have always been a favourite genre for me, and in Mockingjay we get war in all it's horror and heroism all tied into a comprehensive and intelligent bundle that is carried effortlessly by Jennifer Lawrence. The direction keeps us focused on Lawrence, she is in 95% at least of the scenes and she dominates. Her portrayal of Katniss as a damaged, fragile and very young girl who is also the main prop of a rebellion against horrific oppression is spellbinding.The fact that the script makes no concessions to the action junkie is IMO at least, only to be commended. The rest of the cast seem to have been inspired by her formidable work. Everybody has raised their game to match her, I can't think of a weak link in the rest of the cast's performances. Liam Hemsworth at last make Gale real. There are too many really to list here. Stand outs for were Josh Hutcherson's Peeta, Elizabeth Banks Effie, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Plutarch and of course Donald Sutherland's Corialanus Snow. A great story needs a great villain and his Snow is both fascinating and repellent.And on a final closing note, this film makes the eternal whining of the so-called BR 'fans' look more pathetic than ever and leaves you scratching your head wondering what film they saw.",9,22,60,20 November 2014
The Hunger Games," At last, a first class adaptation of a first class book.
","I have always thought that The Hunger Games was a very good book with a lean and powerful way of conveying the plot. The film has a lean and powerful way with showing this. Going beyond strict adherence to the book it translates the story into a cracking cinema experience. The director got first class performances out of his cast, his vision of the books was spot on and I really did not notice the 'shaky-cam' camera work. I also have to commend the wardrobe dept, the fashions of the Capitol were truly bizarre and Katniss and Peeta's 'Fire Costumes' were just right. I in fact thought the red interview dress was better than the one described in the book. The killings in the arena were brutal and tragic. The death of Rue was just as heart wrenching as the book and I thought Jennifer Lawrence wonderfully conveyed her dilemma over her feelings or Peeta. I also really enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. He was great in a very difficult role to pull off well. On re-reading some of the reviews I find it so amazing that some people are still trying to say that Collins 'ripped-off' an obscure Japanese film that was never released in the US till after this film was in the cinemas. I just find it so difficult to believe that she 'stole' ideas from a film that never played in her country. It's just so hard to steal ideas that you don't know were made, and did the fact that Takami seems to have 'stolen' his idea for 'Battle Royale' book from a previously published book called 'The Knights of the Forty Islands' count as a rip-off' as well?",10,5,21,23 March 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good news & bad news.
","The good news is that Joss Whedon's dialogue is just as witty as ever. His characters sparkle with wit and it's fun just sitting there and watching the Avenger's have a good time. Their good time is infectious. The bad news is that there is so many of them. James Spader's Ultron is charismatic and very powerful is another piece of good news, his Minions are not as much fun as Gru's from 'Despicable Me' though. And if like me you find yourself folding your hand bag strap as small as you can and then counting the loops, well think of all those poor boys in the audience who don't even have a handbag strap to fold. I was rather disappointed to tell the truth.The direction is good, the acting is good, the action is getting very old hat by now. The 3D, well what can you say. I didn't notice anything great about it. When all you are noticing in a film is the fact that Thor's hair could really use a good shampoo and blow dry, the story isn't really holding your attention.",7,3,9,5 May 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," OK film, terrible adaption
","Deathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of it was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director and scriptwriter for the source mat√©riel. The book had a rather good plot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to include any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that had nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other parts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and simply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does anyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and how many Harry had, if indeed he had any?So OK film, terrible, terrible adaption.",1,12,18,17 July 2011
