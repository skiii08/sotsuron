Blade Runner 2049," Well-done but SLOW
","I loved the imagery and characters but I was getting bored. I'm a big fan of the original and I feel they kept the spirit of it, but it wasn't very entertaining to me. I wasn't a Gosling fan, and now I'm definitely not. He added to my boredom. But the rest of the acting is very good. I also found it a bit hard to follow, but I was so bored that I didn't care much.",4,7,14,15 October 2017
