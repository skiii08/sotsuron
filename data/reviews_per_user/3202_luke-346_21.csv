"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Been here, seen it!
","Directed by David Schwimmer, Run Fatboy Run is a warm hearted comedy that does nothing new for the genre but merely follows in the footsteps of previous offerings. The film tells of how Dennis (Simon Pegg) runs away from his fiancé Libby (Thandie Newton) and his unborn child only to have a sense of resolve five years later (now that he's grown up). And, here's the twist, in order to prove that he is now worthy of ex-fiancés hand he embarks on an attempt at the London marathon.Regrettably any negative preconceptions of this film are confirmed from the outset, for example, in sticking firmly to genre conventions and expectation the film quickly establishes David as an unfit wimp by him being outwitted by a shop-lifting transvestite (clearly only a transvestite to elicit a smile), it also stereotypes his Pakistani landlord to the point of it being cringe worthy and it reacquaints us with the clichéd 'smooth boyfriend' character - brilliantly played by Hank Azaria.The film concentrates on Dennis and the struggles and pitfalls he encounters on his quest to win back his ex-fiancé, but in doing so it tiresomely emulates the media's obsession with sporting underdogs and how they are always winners on some level. Its chosen plot is something that has been played out, many, many times in cinema and it is disconcerting to see a contemporary comedy with bright actors and a fresh director regress to such tedious story-telling.In a nutshell the film parodies modern masculine anxieties, from the worry of marriage, commitment and fatherhood to the ever more popular and relevant... 'am I getting a belly'. In satirising these notions the film epitomizes the generic conventions of all those films that have preceded it, from Big Daddy to the more recent Knocked Up. Run Fatboy Run is a film that could have quite easily starred Adam Sandler and have been based around the New York marathon; it tells a story that has no real relevance to its cast or locations. In addition I could imagine Hugh Grant playing the 'smooth talking boyfriend'.Fans of Simons Pegg's previous offerings will not enjoy this as much as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, but will nevertheless gain some delight from the brief cameos of Stephen Merchant and David Walliams. Given that it centres around a marathon it is ironic that the film plods along at such a predictable pace, with the only sense of urgency evolving from the certainty that it has an end. There is no attempt at characterisation and the audience will not care what happens to the people on screen as no real empathy or identification with them is likely to occur.Some scenes are funny, most notably his attempt to relieve himself of his groin rash, the moment he hits the wall and a blister popping in his friends face. The laughs are there (be them sparse), but given how they're executed and placed, it is clear they are gags that have been worked into the film to help make it funnier. Unfortunately the over worked idea and the clichéd plot devices take its toll on a film that would have been better if it the characters had been more distinctive, which is a shame because given the films short comings Schwimmer does manage to evoke heartfelt performances from his leads. Finally, the trait of predictability in a film will always pull an audience, as some viewers like well-worn ideas - the very notion proves they are a success. But if you're after something similar to Peggs previous work, that's inventive or off the wall, then this film isn't it.",3,15,24,21 April 2008
Superbad," A new breed of teenage comedy! One of 2007's finest!
","Every now and then Hollywood tends to knock out a comedy about teenagers that causes a stir, ruptures a spleen and sticks with a certain generation, whether it be 'Animal House',' Porky's' or 'American Pie' and 2007's offering is no different. Superbad is quite possibly the funniest film of last year. It continues the tired theme of young men talking about getting 'laid' and being sex crazed, adolescents pining for alcohol, nerds being singled out by bullies, girls as sex objects and figures of authority being outrageously stupid. Whilst championing the stereotyped desires of your average male pubescent Superbad utilises coarse antics and dirty language to great comedic effect with its well written characters and illogical dialogue. The average film goer will know this type of film inside out and I believe, this time, that to be acceptable as comedies of this nature need to rely on audience preconceptions in order to maintain a good level of comicality. Films like this help to prove that originality isn't necessary and that sometimes reinvigorating well worn ideas with modern themes can be a good thing - and it is not often noted in comedies as being so (more so sub-horror genres).Providing you switch off and ignore the lack of ethnic characters, its sexual stereotyping and its general societal inaccuracies then you will enjoy this film - or you could pretend that you're 15 and phrases like 'sexual stereotyping' aren't even on your radar yet. Ultimately Superbad isn't new, it isn't a film that pushes boundaries or reinvents the genre Â– instead it is a film that complements its contemporaries and brilliantly so. It is no surprise that this film did so well with teenage audiences and that so many adults found it repulsive.",7,1,4,14 January 2008
Juno," A pleasant, mild-mannered, well-written, emotionally amusing... little film.
","Juno is the first film to be written by Diablo Cody and has already gained much recognition for its caustic and apt renditions of youth. The film tells of a 16 year old girl called Juno who discovers that she is pregnant. She quickly explores the various options available to her before deciding on having the baby put up for adoption. The film then follows her through the pregnancy and documents her along the way. Juno is a film that manages to tug at the heart strings of those that watch it and many critics have drawn obvious parallels with fellow off-beat heart warmers 'Little Miss Sunshine' and 'Garden State'  films that are equally as good as, if not better than, Juno. What makes Juno better is that because of its chosen topic and amusing anecdotes it has a superior emotional appeal making the film more of a charm.Juno is written with a sense of cynicism and wit that that feels both refreshing and pertinent to modern youth; her manner of speaking is aptly fitting for a 16 year old girl because it has been culturally influenced and reworked in her favour. Her quips, witticisms and sarcasm manifest themselves through her distorted grasp of language i.e. she utilizes words and phrases for her own benefit, as do many teenagers. Cody's ability to capture this style of speech has been appraised in many quarters with some interviewers even suggesting that she'd hung-out with teenagers before writing the film. She has denied this. My problem doesn't lie with the 16 year old Juno, but with all of the other characters  as I believe none of them stand apart from Juno. For example the banter between her parents bears similarity to Juno's distinct delivery, many of the lines delivered by her baby's father Paulie and her friend could have easily been said by Juno. To have these characters delivering quips and puns with such a readiness as Juno I found a little disheartening as it almost undermined Juno's incisive repertoire. Moreover Cody has since stated that many of the young Juno's attributes are ones that she'd have liked when she was 16. This information allows for more forgiving criticism as previously I had issues with a girl of 16 having such an extensive and knowledgeable background of punk music and Italian horror films. Unfortunately it doesn't bode well with your writing skills if you need to explain your motivations once the piece is finished.Because the central theme to the film Juno is pregnancy it has been stated that it is championing pro-life (or dare I say it - American Christian Fundamentalism). I do not agree with this, but I do find it a little confusing that we never really know what goes through Juno's mind in the Abortion clinic. One such explanation is that perhaps it is an allegory for choice and, no matter her choice, no one (not even the audience) has right to know her reasons. With abortion being such a feisty issue I find it amusing that both camps have been stereotyped here. The receptionist of the abortion clinic is depicted as a sexually obsessed moron and the prospective patients are ridden with angst, but this is counter balanced by the lone pro-life protester outside that doesn't know what day it is or how to run her own life, let alone preach to others about theirs. Juno flees from both and there is no need to concentrate on the abortion clinic any further as Juno has made her decision albeit unknown as to why. Admittedly the premise of Juno could be frustrating to real-life pro-choice supporters, but to delve into these political connotations any further would be unjust to the film.The music used in Juno feels like the makers are trying to impose their tastes upon us, much in the same way Zach Braff did with the band 'The Shins' in 'Garden State'. A bonus in using such a technique is that it will increase the films cult status through strengthening its appeal and by possibly making it nostalgic in years to come, this idea is furthered by the final guitar scene. Directed by Jason Reitman, Juno employs certain approaches to this type of cinema that are steadily becoming clichéd e.g. the animated in-film titles or the various montages of stills but despite this the film moves along with a fluidity of pace that is both complementary and non-encroaching on the films themes. Overall Juno is a pleasant, mild-mannered, well-written, emotionally deep and amusing little film  it is film that will fill almost every audience member with amplitude feelings of placid merriment. All I can advise is to ignore the hype and go and see it in a small cinema with not many people or at home with a bottle of wine and you will not be disappointed.",8,6,12,17 February 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Finally a contemporary American horror with a little bit of guts!
","Alexandre Aja has constructed a wonderful horror remake of Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes, but before I get to the ins and outs of my comment I think it's important to note that the horror genre should split opinions and on reading some of the other comments this film it clearly does. Yes it does contain scenes that some viewers would find 'gory', 'stomach churning', 'horrific', 'sick', 'twisted' and even 'demented', but these are all terms that I believe should be associated with a good horror film. Secondly it is one of the few contemporary American horror films that dare to embrace a scene of sexual violence and consider it integral to the plot. This is due to it occurring during the audiences' introduction to the nuclear fall-out victims and is purely there to help assist the audience in establishing these characters as extremely menacing and repulsive and every time these characters are seen on screen this is how the audience will feel - repulsed. Having seen the film several times now I can say that it is encouraging to see a film that is attempting to push the boundaries that little bit more on what can be accepted in modern Hollywood cinema (even if it is in the form of mutated killers in the New Mexico desert).The suffering encountered by the family throughout the film will be seen by some viewers as gruesome  but then again it is a horror! The film does suffer from horror clichés and it does pose you with many burning questions whilst you are watching (including 'Why shoot?' Why investigate the strange noise?' 'Don't go in there' etc) and these thoughts will take the edge away for many viewers. The Hills Have Eyes does have a strong Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel to it as there are many similarities that can quite easily be drawn. Another film that's heavily referenced is Straw Dogs, mainly through the Character of Doug to Dustin Hoffman, as audiences will quite easily buy into his perceived outlook on life not to mention his laid-back appearance.Another downfall in the film lies with the decision for it to have a strong political stance. It is littered with examples, predominantly encapsulated with the over use of the American flag. There are many political connotations including the reference of guns being a tool for Republicans (and the guns ultimate failure in achieving any service for the family  in fact it's negative), the use of the Hendrix's 'Star Spangled Banner' riff when Doug reaches down to collect his glasses after a bloody battle with a nuclear fall-out victim (a rendition that is often associated with anti-war and anti-American notions), the use of the dog as his sidekick can arguably be seen as an association with the Democrats (Blue Dog Democrats, Yellow Dog etc) and of course the role of the girl in the bright red coat.Finally the film is a very good remake and yes, in my opinion, it is better and it will divide movie goers but what it won't do is divide the level of appreciation that will gained by many horror fans from this welcomed, well-made and well delivered re-instalment to the genre.",7,1,1,1 February 2007
The Orphanage," Back to the routes of horror!!
","The Orphanage is a very well made, good old fashioned horror. It tells of a woman called Laura (Belen Rueda) that returns to the abandoned orphanage where she was raised, with the hope of re-opening it for a new generation of children. During the course of the film Laura's child goes missing and she is forced to shelve her plans of re-opening. The event compels Laura to spend more time in the house hoping that her child will return and results in her confronting her sanity. In sticking to an old fashioned premise the films employs a various amount of techniques and methods commonly attributed to films of this genre. The highlights being the big old house, creepy visitors, strange occurrences and things that go bump in the night.It is quite conceivable to think that any film that utilises such clichés and generic scare tactics is doing nothing new and can be dismissed as being unoriginal and possibly unimaginative. To the contrary, in bravely addressing the very routes of the genre the director, and writer, have produced a masterpiece in contemporary horror. The film is an excellent rendition of the classic bedtime horror story, told with atmospheric direction and brilliantly placed plot occurrences. It is an emotional film that reaches to the very heart of fear whilst re-establishing the genre in the minds of contemporary cinema goers. The Orphanage is film that is intelligently made and will go on to become a definitive horror film, much in the same way as Jacobs Ladder, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Sixth Sense – all films that carry similar themes.Those that aren't familiar with those previous films or wish to have their thrills in the form of Saw or Hostel will no doubt find The Orphanage tame and those that get their kicks from Asian horror (Gin gwai, Ringu etc) could also feel begrudged. In a disagreement with these films The Orphanage doesn't allow itself to be drawn into using one scare technique and continuously exploiting it throughout, nor does it prey on teenage anxieties or irrational fears. Instead the film embarks on a much more intellectual (and bold) approach and investigates one of the most basic primeval fears, that of losing a child. In exploring such a fear it is only fitting that all the characters be played well, and they are. Their fall from grace and their reaction to the events are brilliantly complemented by the well directed and paced plot. The timing of the scares and the execution of them are also done to perfection. All of these qualities add up to the film being a refreshing experience that, consequentially, sticks two fingers up to the recent and predictably made horror films churned out by Hollywood (1408, Vacancy etc).Ultimately The Orphanage is an encouraging debut feature from the director Juan Antonia Bayona and shows a lot of potential. The film is dark, mysterious and harrowing like Guillermo del Toro's Pans Labyrinth - which also has child at the heart of the film. Both films also drive home the extreme capabilities of imagination and dissolution.The film is presented by del Toro and, in much the same way Tarantino presented Hostel, there is no real direct evidence of his efforts on the screen. Instead The Orphanage is more of a continuation of the style and characteristics associated with his film-making. Those that, like me, have been pining for a classical contemporary horror should look no further than The Orphanage.",9,7,11,24 March 2008
The Machinist," One word... 'cult'!
","Whilst it should be forgiven for being reliant on modern narrative clichés, the Machinist is a magnificent rendering of guilt, emasculation and paranoia. Anderson utilises an uncomplicated Hitchcockian approach to his film-making with uses of bleak imagery, abstract characters (Bales emasculating performance is award worthy) and nostalgic compositions to create a film that fully deserves its cult status among contemporary culture. Its intellectual approach will leave you questioning aspects of the film, including the overall outcome. The Machinist is a truly inspired and wonderful film and is a must for all intellectuals and Christian Bale fans alike.",10,7,10,22 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," A beautifully intellectual work of art, not for all audiences.
","Not since Fargo have these two talents, Joel & Ethan Coen, approached and delivered a text with such finesse. No Country for Old Men is an amalgamation of concentrated characters, beautifully constructed metaphors and intertwined narratives that consummate in an astounding subversion of the thriller genre. The film is an insightful interrogation of manhood, or more predominantly American manhood (so often witnessed in a lot of the Coen's work). With its unconventional storytelling and unorthodox narrative No Country for Old Men is a film that requires the viewer to be sagacious and perceptive in order to heed and unravel the films intertextuality. It is arguably one of those films that will require multiple viewings to fully appreciate it.The film takes place on the Texas border in 1980 and tells of man called Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a heroin trade off/massacre, loots two million dollars and returns to his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) only to succumb to his own stupidity and return to the scene at night to help a wounded man he had previously left for dead. A drugs cartel hire a recently escaped sociopath called Anton (Javier Bardem) to retrieve the money, meanwhile Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Le Jones) and his deputy investigate the massacre. The narrative model exercised here is evident throughout the majority of the Coen's work, this model being the recognition and tackling of an obstacle between the hero and the object of his/her desires - the obstacle often being the hero's stupidity. For example the fumbling naivety of Norville Barnes in The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), the endearing fatuousness of The Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998) and the bumbling buffoonery of the convicts in O'Brother, Where Art Thou (2000) all hinder progress.Chiefly the film tackles the ideas of choice, fate and chance personified by the coin-toss scene at the beginning. However, No Country for Old Men employs an unconventional story which has dismayed some critics, some even citing occurrences in the plot as examples of the films faults. One such example is the timing and choice to dismiss a centrifugal character which has been described by some critics as an illustration of directorial arrogance and contempt for their audience. In a direct response to these widely held allegations I feel that the choice to dismiss this character was a brave decision and a more truthful representation on the musings of human life and its many dispositions fitting entirely with the over arching theme of the film. Criticisms of plot and narrative devices, such as the example mentioned, tend to occur because of a belief that generally speaking a film should serve up conventions that allow for it to be understood and followed and if these conventions are ignored or dismissed then the film is not a film but a mishmash of ideas. To put it bluntly I feel that this belief has developed through conditioning. Additionally it is often perceived that if a film challenges conventions or reworks them then it is, in essence, original - which is widely read as cinematic progress.At its heart No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognisable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humour.To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanour of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Barden's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerising and his mere appearance a pure treat. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come, dare I say it, better than.I have yet to see its fellow 2007 Academy Award nominee There Will Be Blood, but No Country for Old Men is surely an Oscar winner and perhaps it will be the Coen's first as directors or second as writers. It is cinematic excellence of the highest pedigree that is both lasting and haunting.",10,7,14,25 January 2008
The Number 23," An interesting concept... and that's about it!
","From the director of such cult classics as 'The Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down' and such huge flops as 'Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Phone Booth', this film could go one of two ways, and it did the latter! In brief, the film tells of one mans obsession with the number 23 after the purchase of a book. It is an interesting concept, much in the same way as Phone Booth is, but it fails to live up to anything but that 'an interesting concept'.The film reads as a question on the main characters sanity and whether the number 23 can ensnare and consume people. It can do, and this evident in the fact that if you look hard enough you will find it for example the Number 23 is Joel Schumacher's 23rd project as director, the DVD has 23 chapters and the main character, Walter Sparrow, had an obsession with the saxophone. The saxophone, of course, has 23 keys. Yes, that's right; the obsessions in the film are tenuous to say the least and unfortunately this is an issue which is never really addressed.The film (with Schumacher on board) is stylish of course, but I couldn't help thinking that I wish this film had a lower budget and was released on the European circuit where I feel it would have favoured much better. The film was too polished, it needed to be grittier, dirtier, more consuming and interesting (but on a deeper level).Psychological thrillers are tough and are one of the few genres that produce masterpieces so rarely, they are often ridden with a cliché narrative which usually culminates in a twist, and this film is no different and given the films mediocre script the vast majority of audiences will see it coming which leaves the film with a weak ending. It is unfortunate as I would have liked to have witnessed a clever film; instead I've seen a good director make another hash of an interesting concept!",6,1,3,6 December 2007
The Lives of Others," A highly masterful rendition of good old-fashioned human decency that is both compelling and thought provoking!
","Set mostly in the 1980s and during the cold war, Das Leben der Anderen tells of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army by which the Socialist Unity Party kept control of the German Democratic Republic, aka GDR) and how GDR citizens lived in a world of repression. A state security captain, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is an expert in interrogating dissidents and is assigned the case of spying on a playwright called Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). It is for this reason (of being a playwright) that he is put under surveillance. As Weisler's investigation progresses he becomes unwittingly aware of his own limited existence and empathy for those he watches ensues, taking precedence over his obedience and loyalty to the Stasi  so much so that he begins to falsify documents and lie about events in Dreyman's life. Regarding the films treatment of the Stasi, Das Leben der Anderen has caused controversy upon its release, especially in Germany with people comparing the members of the Stasi to that of the Gestapo, 40 years previous. Recent German history is littered with examples of the Stasi's uncompromising approach  some of which are still coming to fruition. In brief the Stasi spied on, imprisoned, and ruined the lives of anyone it chose and in the immediate aftermath of the war there were a lot of deaths or 'liquidations' of opponents. In later years the Stasi abandoned this approach in favour of psychological torture and exile. They would routinely brake into peoples flats, steal underwear (to be bottled as odour samples) for identification purposes and use psychotropic drugs on those under house arrest, this would mostly happen due to tip offs from fellow GDR citizens turned informers, as once an informer certain liberties would follow. Artists and those of a creative nature (writers, poets, journalist etc) were a favoured choice of the Stasi and their work was often either stifled, scrutinised, compromised or even destroyed  similarities with the manner in which Nazi's burned books are blatantly apparent; the film also makes plenty of references to books being a source of provocation. Because of all this GDR citizens lived in world of fear and paranoia, as individuals they were afraid and suspicious of all those they met. It was, without question, a totalitarian society.Das Leben der Anderen is very low budget, but it is outstandingly written capturing the essence of people's feelings at the time  with some great lines being ironically delivered by a government minister, the greatest line in the film though has to be the last because of its emotional connotations. The direction and the cinematography capture a sombre and monotonous East Germany with its drab lighting and muted colours, perfectly illustrating the despondency of its citizens. Performances throughout the film are excellent, Gerd Weislers girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is a joy to watch, most notably the uncomfortable anxiety she displays during a scene in the back of a taxi cab manages to be felt by all those watching as does her expression of guilt and betrayal towards the end of the film. The greatest performance however comes from Ulrich Muhn. The opening scene in Das Leben der Anderen shows him lecturing some students on the art of integration; he plays them a cassette of one of his own interrogations. The man on the tape complains of being tired, to which a student declares that it is inhuman to deny him his sleep. Wielser scribbles a mark next to the students name before he retorts  this act alludes to the possibility that this individual will face some sort of punishment for his remark. Weisler continues teaching and, in accordance with the cassette, states that a guilty man will become quiet and reiterate his rehearsed lies, whilst an innocent man will shout and scream. This behaviour and this carefully constructed scene beautifully underpins the Stasi regime, it sets forth and establishes the type of character Weisler is, whilst allowing for the understanding that any deviation from this way of thinking results in you becoming an enemy.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding accomplishment because of its proficiency at utilising old-fashioned narratives and placing them into a malevolent world - that was once real. Unfortunately it tells of a story that did not occur (the director and his researchers underwent four years of research for the film and could not find one example of a Stasi man empathisising with dissidents or even suspected dissidents) and although accurate in many other areas the films core values are untrue and almost propagandarous. To assume that a man like Weisler could change his beliefs questions the very understandings of a totalitarian state, it ignores historical accuracy to feed cinema's desire to misrepresent and fabricate history for the purpose of entertainment and it is this that is simultaneously the films strength and its weakness. In a nutshell the film is about hope, it is a word that is mentioned a lot and it is something that propels the characters and narrative forward and it is how the story finally resolves itself - by pandering to this sense of hope. Despite its short comings, Das Leben der Anderen is one of the first films to look back at the GDR and not reminisce or gain humour from it ('Good Bye, Lenin!', 2003) and it treats them with heavier hand than many other German films to date, but it also lets them off lightly. I am a strong believer in film as an art form and had the film been more truthful to itself then it would have been an incredible piece of art, but in sticking with recent trends laid out by current German film-makers (a common attribute of New German Cinema) the film has fused both art and entertainment thus leading to Das Leben der Anderen being just an incredible piece of entertainment.",9,4,5,8 February 2008
The Mist," A very courageous horror film. Well done!!
","As any film fan will know, if Frank Darabont adapts a Stephen King novel and directs it then you should really sit up and take note. For those that are unaware, Darabont wrote and directed the Stephen King adaptations The Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile and now he brings to us The Mist, which is ironically a return to roots for Frank Darabont who started out writing on 80s horror B Movies. The Mist is a film about a group of townsfolk whose town becomes engulfed by a terrifying cloud that traps them inside a glass-fronted convenience store. The cloud contains strange creatures and various monsters that could quite easily kill the humans, should the mist make its way into the building.As the characters converse inside the building they are forced to get along as best they can, shades of Lord of the Flies springs to mind and, characterized by their behavior, they begin to take sides and split into factions. Superbly written and wonderfully acted, all the characters portray a sense of realism that is rarely captured when trying to represent such hostile environments. Furthermore, being that we live in an age when reality TV and manufactured environments are created to imprison volunteers for the amusement of others, a film like The Mist has more bearing on our conscious than perhaps the makers envisaged. This connotation with contemporary sources of entertainment provides the audience with the ability to register and humanize with the townsfolk much more easily allowing for their dilemmas and disagreements to have an increased impact, which in turn intensifies the horrific nature of their circumstances.The best performance of the film is by Marcia Gay Harden, who plays Mrs. Carmody, a religious nut that achieves a leadership through her constant preaching. The manner in which she plays Mrs. Carmody leads me to believe that she is a much underrated actress as during this film I truly despised her. The anti-religious notions that are ever present throughout the film are tainted with malevolent undertones and fanatical ideologies that brilliantly portray a level of fear rarely touched upon in contemporary horror. The Mist tells of religion as being fundamental to some peoples grasp of hope and that with it even the most apparently sane individuals will result in 'lynching' others to achieve savior. It is an austere representation of religion that serves as a reminder to us all of its capabilities. The fact that the religion being pilloried in The Mist is Christianity has been dwelled upon too much by some critics, this choice of religion is merely fitting given the films location and setting, any other choice would have been inappropriate.The Mist is a fine cult horror, so much so that it does not deserve to be viewed in a cinema. It is a film that would play out much better watched at home on your own TV. It is an intellectual film that will no doubt cause debate to ensue following the final reels. Ultimately, and as with previous Darabont ventures, the film is about hope. Its narrative is strongly embedded in the characters belief that there may be way out of their predicament and that their fate is not yet sealed. This is beautifully illustrated at one point in the film when one of the groups, which have emerged from the townsfolk, must make the decision of either staying with the brainwashed, or venturing into the outside mist; it is a choice of facing one of two fears  fellow humans or the unknown. Their fate sealed if they stay, but perhaps not if they leave.The film is pessimistic in its outlook and serves as wonderful reminder of the importance of hope to us all. The ending has gained a lot of criticism, but I believe it to be by far one of the best endings to a film I have seen in a long time. After it had finished the despair and anguish I felt was in direct correlation with the characters and the story, thus the film had achieved its goal. I whole heartedly admire a director that has the courage to go against a studios wishes and audience expectations and provide an ending that is a bleak and daunting as the 120 minutes that have preceded it. Frank Darabont has stuck with the continuity of the narrative themes and left us with perhaps the starkest metaphor for hope ever to grace contemporary cinema.Finally, The Mist is a contemporary B Movie, which is no surprise given Darabonts history in the area but also it is a wonderful social commentary that so happens to take its shape in a horror film, that also happens to be a Stephen King adaption. After seeing The Mist, Darabont has gone up a notch in my estimations as a director and writer. I thoroughly recommend The Mist to anyone that likes to leave a film feeling depressed, but immensely satisfied.",9,3,8,5 July 2008
Transformers," Spielberg's on board, be it ever so minimal! But it shows!!!
","Transformers is a film by Michael Bay, the same man behind such action spectacles as Armageddon, Pearl Harbour and The Rock, which is normally the kind of film I steer clear of. However, I decided to view this upon learning that this time out Bay had traded his producer of those three films, Jerry Bruckheimer, for the more acclaimed Steven Spielberg (arguably the auteur of the Hollywood Blockbuster) and it's probably a good thing that he did, because Transformers delivers.Unfortunately I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon series, so I cannot comment on the films accuracy, but then if the film is meant to be an adaptation - how many adaptations are entirely accurate? I have read some critical reviews of this film and the majority seem to be disgusted at the representation of the Transformers - mainly due to their alteration from the original cartoon. I feel that the film doesn't aim to be a direct replication of a cartoon series, but that it aims to be a blockbuster in homage of a cartoon series and I believe this to be something it does very well. When Hollywood makes these films I am almost sure they have a checklist or a personal routine that the maker (usually the Producer) abides by. Constructing a blockbuster is an intricate process and when Spielberg is involved it is often perfected, Transformers contains many of the elements that are familiar with Spielberg's blockbusters and fantasy's including good old fashioned fighting, aliens, a geek, a computer nerd, a hot chick, a funny fat guy, fast cars, gadgets, an old explorer, secret military layers, secret government divisions, the President, Air Force One, explosions, goodies, baddies, a crack code, a hidden map, polished CGI and many more.In an academic and purely filmic sense, the film is floored on nearly all levels, the acting is poor, the script is bad and there needs to be a lot more work done in post-production, but to attack a film like this would be like a Michelin Star rep attacking McDonald's cuisine  it would be mean and unfair. Films like this serve a purpose, and it is the achievement of that purpose that is carried out very well in Transformers.",6,3,4,6 December 2007
Children of Men," A classic dystopian text!
","I would have to argue that Children of Men is great, if you like good old fashioned dystopian narratives. Children of Men is a typical dystopian film in that it is an exercise in a politically charged form of hybrid textuality. The vast majority of dystopian texts, including Children of Men, often offer detailed and pessimistic presentations of the very worst of social alternatives. The social alternative in Children of Men is the future  a future in which it is no longer possible to have children, reproduce or start a family. In enabling us to experience this alternative, Children of Men examines how certain contemporary issues and planetary governments could facilitate a social order that is relentlessly harsh, destructive, and miserable. A crucial factor of this vision is the films ability to register the impact of an unexamined social system on the everyday lives of everyday people which is, of course, set against the English backdrop of 2027. However, although this film creates a dystopian society of unseen quantities it interestingly depicts speculative forms of history that purport to describe a set of future developments traceable to present conditions. Examples of this lie in the treatment of the prisoners (Abu Ghraib), crooked authority figures and the manner in which illegal immigrants are treated as a whole is also a current issue in today's society. Yet here it is taken further, as so often the future can, to a nightmare world in which all traces of human rights are disregarded. Children of Men manages to execute this vision superbly as it allows us to feel that pain, the woe and dismay of the characters as they embark upon a journey of hope.Children of Men is ultimately about a journey, a journey of hope a hope of trying to escape a dystopian nightmare with the reward at the end of this journey being a utopian dream. To aid the telling of this story Cuaron utilises some fantastic camera techniques - the pick of the bunch being the scene inside the car. I must admit I am an extreme fan of long takes and Children of Men is by far the best I've witnessed in recent times. The use of such long takes in Children of Men help to facilitate a sense of real time (almost documentary in comparison) which in turn gives an implication of reality. It also aids in increasing the characters appeal whether it be negative or positive as we continuously become witness to many uninterrupted sequences of events. In employing such long takes Children of Men also manages to bring about notions of rolling news coverage that is reminiscent of footage that could only ever be acquired in the Reuters library. It is not just the camera-work that portrays this; the explosions are also brilliant and hark back to the stunts and pyrotechnics used in Saving Private Ryan. The sound is also fantastic, a great example of this being the early morning farmyard scene - a scene in the film in which the characters must try to remain silent. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good film-making, pictures from this genre and fine story-telling as they will not be disappointed.",10,6,11,16 January 2007
Garden State," Contemporary, interesting and stereotypical!
","This is a very good film; it's a film that will speak to a generation of people. Predominantly those in their late teens to early 20s, those that feel alienated, different and to those that feel every personal problem can only be likened to a nuclear holocaust. It is for a section of contemporary youth who believe that a late assignment, a failed relationship or an untidy bedroom are on a similar level to Andrew Largemen's (Zach Braff) issues of being prescribed mind bending/altering medication since the age of 11, crippling your own mother and the guilt trip encompassing her death. The clichés of modern youth are played out with almost every character through them having either an OCD or some kind of neurotic condition e.g. Sam (Natalie Portman) is a compulsive liar and plain strange, there's the man who's obsessed with pyramid schemes, Sam's brother who becomes so upset when somebody urinates on his console he dusts for fingerprints, the man that works in a Medieval-themed restaurant and wears his armour home and the man who became rich by inventing silent Velcro.Garden State is a good old fashioned exploitation film as it stereotypes the youth of today, it places them in a corner and tells them that even the most damaged and confused of you can find happiness in the end. Luckily in some quarters this is how people saw the film although other quarters will feel it speaks directly to them (a common attribute of exploitation films; look at Bridget Jones for a prime example). I feel that Garden State is not a parody of itself, but a parody of the audience it's trying to connect with exemplified by what I've already written and the amount of quirkiness on screen, it is almost admitting to itself that the audience might have an ADD  another stereotype of today's youth.Overall the film is quirky, prime examples being the scenes of a young couple living in a boat in a quarry, a hamster graveyard and Andrew's means of transport. It is also stylish with its cleverly filmed swimming pool scene (depicts Andrew's isolation brilliantly), its party scene and the bleak ending. Garden State is well acted (Portman is Brilliant, best role since Leon) and well directed and it deserves top marks for being the first outing by Zach Braff as a film director, writer and star but not for being a film that's so untrue to itself.",7,1,2,6 December 2007
Black Snake Moan," An interesting take on the root of the blues!
","A very well made veracious examination of race, sex, religion, abandonment and neurosis. Undertaken through Ricci's (childhood abused, sexually crazed) nymphomaniac character Rae and Jackson's (equally sick and neglected, moral searching) musician character Lazarus. In believing that God has placed Rae in his path, Lazurus uses his musical skills, of playing the blues, to aid both characters in finding each other under these desperate circumstances. The narrative of this film tells of the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town and how they deal with the issues of divorce, soul-searching, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. The film is violent and comedic in parts, the best example of this being when Lazurus tells of losing his virginity 'it was out behind my uncle's barn with my second cousin', although this is comedic it is also very telling of the films ideas and aims.Black Snake Moan is an interesting concept that many audiences will relate to and understand, especially if big fans of the blues. However the film is deeper than that and this is evident in our reaction to the characters handling of the films themes as some will feel compelled to contrast these issues to the more developed areas of the western world and a primary example of this being carried out is the town minister, who defies logic by grappling with his own problems through becoming the counsellor and mediator for the lead characters. Directorially the film is very good and Craig Brewer has managed to set himself apart from fellow beginners in the industry, his framing, scene arrangement (misc-en-scene), lighting and general story-telling are very good and almost unmatched in contemporary Hollywood. The film features very solid acting, from both leads and is probably Jackson's best performance since Pulp Fiction, my only doubt lies with Justin Timberlake's character, but on a second viewing I'm sure I'll know the answer to that.Finally, this film is definitely one of those that will make you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It is a film with a thoroughly human story that really speaks to the root of the blues.",7,3,6,6 December 2007
The Dark Knight," Perhaps one of the most intellectual blockbusters to date.
","Directed by the unyielding Christopher Nolan, Batman's latest outing is the one of the most intellectual blockbusters to date. It incorporates every element that a blockbuster needs in order for it to live up to that billing, whilst simultaneously sticking firmly to its comic book origins. Nolan has been hired to make a massive film and that's exactly what he's delivered making Batman the most successful movie franchise ever. This time around The Dark Knight follows Batman (Christian Bale) incorporating the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to eradicate organized crime in Gotham for good. Unfortunately they fall prey to the criminal mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger).The Dark Knight starts like all good blockbuster should, with pace. For example the opening few scenes show an in-progress heist that echo's various crime films such as Die Hard and Heat giving The Dark Knight an immediate adult feel. These opening shots have been designed to create tension and Nolan executes them brilliantly. Additionally, and during the heist, the robbers are treacherously and meticulously executed by a counterpart - a great way to establish the malevolence of a baddie. This is because viewers will now be aware of his capabilities leading to his presence being viewed with caution and apprehension. Savvy audience members will also be aware that, despite the robbers' masks, the baddie is the Joker.In pure blockbuster terms the film explores and delves into many of the attributes that make these films a success i.e. the compromised love interest, glamorous women, fight sequences, car chases, explosions, disposable baddies, social dilemmas, black comedy, secret organisations, expensive CGI, fast-paced editing, salient lines and ultimately the near floundering of a hero only for him to emerge stronger. Nolan has utilised these aspects and managed to combine them with various comic books motifs and his own stylish direction.Blockbusters aside, The Dark Night is the best rendition of a comic book to date. Additionally the critics have not been wrong in their praise of the Jokers performance. It is the best Joker to date and talk of a posthumous Oscar nomination is not that far-fetched. Ledger plays the character with such conviction that he manages to command the eye of every audience member, perfectly illustrated during the fund-raising party as despite the actions of his henchmen and the panic of the guests, viewers will remain transfixed on him. It should also be noted that if his first introduction via the heist was not sufficient his second will go down in film folklore due to the entrance and the manner in which he disposes of a villain; it being both chilling and iconic. Batman's introduction is also dark, with him apprehending his helpers, exhibiting superhero strength and killing a dog - Bale fans and film buffs will also how notice how these shots hint at the chainsaw scene in American Psycho. Again this is Nolan wanting to establish a darker side of Batman. Some may also find is gravelly voice irritating, but it should really be expected and it again speaks to the roots of Batman.Being a comic movie the film is littered with references to comic book iconography that are only really found in films of this genre. Examples of this lie in the numerous framed shots of Batman in a side-on pose as they hark back to the very first drawings of him; the fact that the Joker speaks of not killing Batman because he completes him is also the comic book approach to how Batman's villains mirror his character and his development (scarred childhood). Deft touches to the films misc-en-scene including the helium balloon shaped like a comic book speech bubble add to the films grace, as do the various methods the Joker employs to dispose of his victims i.e. a potato peeler, poisoned liquor, a tummy-bomb and a led pencil. These additions aid the film in sticking firmly with the comic mould. It's not just the Joker either as Batman utilises a sonar device that harks back to the comic book renditions of Batman being able to call upon his winged friends for help, in which a similar device is also used.Ultimately Batman is a vigilante in a cape, he is there to fight crime and only he knows best. The Dark Night examines Bruce Wayne's psyche in deeper more conceptual way that its predecessor, here we see that vigilante abandon his code in order to defeat the villain thus shifting Batman further to the darker side. It examines the intricacies of what constitutes heroism in a thought-provoking and entertaining way, making it one of Nolan's most accomplished works. The film is dark but the shadows that are there are used to great effect because a lot of the time they complement both the story and narrative. This is brilliantly exemplified by the scene in which the Joker is interrogated, not only is it superbly directed but it had me thinking of Brando in Apocalypse Now. Cleverly the Jokers gentle submergence and re-emergence from those shadows aptly embodies the very essence of the jokers character; that of mystery. The action sequences are also very impressive, but again because of the lightening I felt little cheated, especially given that they seem to be the best from Hollywood in recent years.Overall the film just falls shy of being a masterpiece, although it can be praised on so many levels from its cinematography to its direction and its performances, it lacks the icing on the cake. It pains me to complain at the films length and its lighting given its subject matter, but it was just too long and had a tad too much going on making the film feel a little cramped. I refuse to dwell on those issues because despite my gripes The Dark Knight is a wonderful film and an experience that should be relished.",9,4,10,30 July 2008
30 Days of Night," Not a great addition to the genre, but perhaps some memorable moments
","In what began as a good premise failed to live up to anything of the sort. 30 Days of Night is a not that a good addition to this genre and I feel that when making a contemporary vampire film any correlation to the original novels and ideals can be disregarded in favour of making the film more acceptable to current audiences via other tools, prime examples being 'Blade', 'Night Watch' and the ever popular 'From Dusk Till Dawn'  30 Days of Night does this, but not intentionally  as although there is mention of sunlight, there is no mention of garlic, crucifixes or stakes etc and no real reason given for not mentioning them. It also lives up to many horror clichés, including the infuriating aspect of giving certain characters depth when their demise is so blatantly imminent, characters threatening the well-being of the others through panic, fleeing thus jeopardising others and reiterating the obvious.The title draws the audience into a false sense of what to expect, as we do not witness 30 days of night as on several occasions the narrative leaps several days leaving the audience questioning the protagonists' endeavours over this time and in doing so fails to attract any real level of isolation. The feeling of isolation was far better tackled in John Carpenters 'The Thing' (also set in cold, desperate conditions near the arctic circle), as was the subject of vampires in his film of the same name.Evolving from music videos, director David Slade, (Hard Candy) does give us some nice shots and scenes with vampires leaping from rooftops and some well filmed bloodshed - the best of which being the birds-eye tracking shot of the village. It is a very revealing shot, as it not only depicts a sense of isolation and desperation, but also the horror and carnage being experienced by the townsfolk. In fact this and the facial makeup of the vampires were the two real highlights of the film for me. The ending is not, and will leave many people annoyed at its cheesiness.",6,1,2,7 December 2007
There Will Be Blood," Any other year, a worthy Oscar winner!
","Ambitiously executed There Will Be Blood is a very impressive film. The backdrop and arrangement of the film alone will evoke such films as Gone With The Wind and Citizen Kane. That may seem like a bold statement but the ambition that is on show here is driven with such force and pedigree that it seems only fitting that comparisons to those films should be made, as will be explained in due course. The film tells of man called Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), who discovers oil, refines his methods and steadily increases his wealth. One day a worker is killed and Plainview adopts his son and names him H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier), and by 1911 Daniel is one of the most successful men in California.In keeping with the current Hollywood trend of echoing 1970s cinema the film has a slow burning plot and a lack of strong women. Furthermore, the lead character, Daniel Plainview is an archetypal anti-hero with a moral complexity and a classic rejection of traditional values. He is also a character with immense tenacity and an unrivalled drive for success. The first 15 minutes encapsulates all of these traits and lays down the foundations for his characters development. With no dialogue Plainview falls down a shaft and breaks his leg, but he manages to pull himself out and to the nearest town. The opening 15 minutes is monumental storytelling as without the tool of dialogue the director (Paul T Anderson) is able to establish a character with grit and determination; a strong, immovable man unwilling to let anything hinder his progress. Daniel Day Lewis's profound acting ability in There Will Be Blood, and Plainview's flaws and inability to be human, are very similar to those of another character and masterpiece of the same name, Citizen Kane, as Plainview is also a man that will stop at nothing to get everything.As with the directors' previous works (Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love) the film carries a lot of religious imagery most of which are directly attributable to Christianity. In one scene a young man by the name of Paul Sunday visits Plainview to inform him of a place (his family's home) where oil seeps through the ground and that he can have the location of it for a small fee. In selling his family out to such a tyrant Paul becomes the Judas of the picture. Ultimately Plainview lies to the Sunday family about its worth and purchases the land at what can be only be regarded as pittance. In a beautifully metaphorical fashion Plainview ignores the advice of a preacher to bless his well and digs up the land, which intern results in disaster. He releases hell, flames shoot upwards, the sky turns black and his blackened demonic face emerges gleaming with excitement unable to hide his pleasure even after the near death experience of his son, H.W. Plainview. The scene is truly magnificent and had me harking back to Classical Hollywood epics (Gone With The Wind, Grapes of Wrath) the score that accompanies it is dauntless and the direction superb. It should also be noted that the sheer aesthetics of the film, from the intrepid soundtrack to the flawless cinematography, make it an immensely pleasurable experience.Unfortunately I had issues with the various stereotypes the film employed. Primarily the film has strong homo-erotic undertones, that truly come to light upon the emergence of Daniel's alleged brother, Henry (Kevin J. O'Connor). During the film the two share quality time on a beach and quite clearly bond during an oil pipeline mapping expedition. Plainview is a man that exhibits the clichéd idiosyncrasies associated with homophobic tendencies. From his absent history with females, his statement at hating all men, his dislike of men and his outlandish dismay at the discovery of his Henry's betrayal. His reaction at Henrys lie confirms a sense of denial in Plainview, albeit an outrageous reaction, as he is clearly angry with himself for letting his emotions surface towards another man, thus adding prominence to his tears.Further problems with the film lie with its story, it refuses to give away too much information and divulges key elements at irregular moments and weights them with too much emphasis or not enough. The scene in which Daniel and his son meet the other Sunday brother Eli (Paul Dano) for the first time is very well executed, as we the audience share with Daniel his bemusement at whether or not this is the same person he met earlier or if it's a twin. This scene is brilliant but it is left wide open and it is not really tied up, despite the fact that he attacks his father for allowing Paul to leave and divulge their location. His father is not allowed to retort, alluding to the fact that maybe Eli is suffering a character disorder; if this was the case it would be much more fitting. Additionally, at the end of the film, Daniel lies to Eli about how much he paid Paul for the information  confusing the matter further.There Will Be Blood is a film that some might believe is ostentatious, but in unravelling the films layers and various metaphors it is a true joy. It is a brilliant examination of politics, fascism, greed and religion and in doing so becomes (perhaps unwittingly) an allegory for contemporary American society and the issues surrounding big business and religion. Daniel Day Lewis is truly outstanding, perhaps the finest physical actor of our generation, his mere presence makes the film compelling, he is undoubtedly every directors dream.In being concurrent with the first scene, the final reels of There Will Be Blood deliver one of the greatest performances by an actor ever committed to celluloid (the milkshake metaphor is brilliant) and one of the greatest final lines in cinema history 'I'm finished'.",10,3,7,18 March 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Fun, quirky, clever!
","This is a fun, quirky, clever little film and it's an off-the-wall character study that'll let you appreciate cinema that tiny bit more and will almost certainly go down as a cult favourite among selective film fans. Directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland) and written by Zach Helm (currently making his Writer/Director debut with Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium) Stranger Than Fiction makes its presence felt from the outset with various cinematic conventions and rules being toyed and played to help create the films own individualistic style. The film tells of a companionless tax man (Will Ferrell) who one day becomes aware of his imminent death via the narrator (Emma Thomson) in his head, he seeks literacy advice from a professor (Dustin Hoffman) who advises him to discover if he's in a comedy or a tragedy to which he does by attempting romance with a baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal), once this is established it then becomes his sole purpose to discover his fate and ultimately contact the narrator to prevent it.Charlie Kaufman (Writer. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Being John Malkovich) was my primary thought at who could have written such a film as it is very Kaufman-like, but unfortunately Stranger Than Fiction does lack some of the more punchier/out there moments experienced in his films. Where Stranger Than Fiction does supersede his work, despite its arguably depressing storyline, is in its ability to remove any feelings of a nihilistic nature and replace them with a warmer, more endearing, optimistic and emotional attachment.Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman all put in brilliant performances and to be honest these are the sorts of performances I would like to being seeing more of, especially Ferrell as I feel that this film does for Ferrell what Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind did for Jim Carrey. The two films are very similar and, if push came to shove, the latter being more accomplished one, although that shouldn't detract anyone from Stranger Than Fiction as in its own right it is a very good, engaging film.",8,1,2,6 December 2007
Hancock," A good idea... poorly executed!
","Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise; it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.The film starts well by introducing us to Hancock asleep, scruffy and unshaven on a public bench but ultimately establishing him as a lousy, grumpy oaf. As the film progresses Hancock evolves into a very endearing character, his apathy and self loathing - exhibited by his alcoholism, are all traits that manage to humanize the myths that surround super human beings. The fact that his physical prowess and lifestyle choice is his undoing is an interesting concept and in some quarters would be regarded as a microcosm of the manner in which gifted, black American men have been marginalized over the years (but this is a short review and I don't want to get that deep... however, examples that come to mind, and help to support this theory, are such great physical talents like Ed Moses, Shaquille O'Neil, Carl Lewis, Jesse Owen etc) some film scholars will no doubt give more precedence to this side of the film.Many critics have labeled the film as being unequal and disjointed and I would have to say that I agree. The first half of the film is amusing, engaging and quite plausible (given its premise) but upon the introduction of a second hero with equal powers the film quickly descends into the farcical. For example, some of the early scenes have Hancock exhibiting his strength in often mundane scenarios from dragging a car up a driveway to dunking a basketball from over 50 meters away but given there placement in the context of the film they are clearly the conceivable actions of a super strong human being. During the latter stages of the film this demonstration of strength becomes inane and coarse, epitomized by a scene in which the two superheroes battle it out the sky, throwing each other across blocks and through buildings, and affecting the weather to such an extent that lightening, twisters and snowfall all takes place. This is ultimately where the film falls down as it resorts to the clichés that are so often witnessed in films of this genre. Ultimately this decline is driven by a foolishly executed back-story that has no place in the film and should have been erased the moment it was conceived. The internal logic of the film is preposterous and nonsensical and would remain so even if it was chief plot device in a Saturday morning kids cartoon.When it comes to the direction it seems surprising to me that Peter Berg should be able to make the leap to making a blockbuster like Hancock, this is because Hancock was always going to be a commercial risk given its target audience and release date and his previous film The Kingdom was not a huge success. In these situations it is normally an established director that is chosen by the studio to carry films of this nature. This is evident from the manner in which the plot, story and narrative transpire to the screen as Berg's direction is gritty, with frantic zooms, sharp fast-pans and steady-cam sequences. His direction does not really complement the film, leading me to believe that in Hancock we have a director that is better than the film he is trying to make, a rarity in film making but it does happen.Finally, Hancock is probably one of the biggest let downs I have had the misfortune to witness this year. The incoherent story has seriously affected the outcome of this film; it has led to it being almost incomprehensible. The futile subplot and unnecessary twist laid the foundations for the films demise. However, despite my immense disappointment I can still sit back and take light in the performances and the direction, but they can do nothing for my overall feelings towards Hancock.",4,55,88,5 July 2008
1408," It's not awful... but it really should be better!
","In what has, allegedly, been perceived as an interesting concept for a horror in a time when contemporary and commercial American cinema seems to be offering nothing more than 'torture trash', is in fact not that interesting. This is mainly due to the fact that once intellectual logic is applied, the film flounders. Overall 1408 fails in its attempt to offer the acceptable psychological horror that has so often been associated with Stephen King adaptations, and it is for precisely this reason that many will feel let down.Those familiar with this genre will however notice the inventive and directorial aspects that make the film stand apart (most notably the drawn out scenes in which our anticipation is ridden on the basis of genre clichés and the claustrophobic nature so brilliantly conveyed via the imaginative use of surrealist imagery). 1408 is not awful, but it should be brilliant and unfortunately it is not",5,1,2,22 September 2007
300," Poor camera-work, bad editing and a dire script... but somehow fun.
","300 is a film littered with poor camera-work, bad editing and has the unfortunate luck of being lumbered with a dire script. The only redeeming features are its stunning visuals, which do manage to set it apart from its Hollywood contemporaries. 300 is a film that has apparently been heralded as an epic of battle like proportions (which it is not), it is visually though as exciting and pioneering as the cult-classics 'Tron', 'Back to the Future II' and even 'Willow' and this is because upon release it has showed some sort of visual cinematic progress, yet it is likely that this is also the reason it will be a cult film in many years to come. Subsequently Zack Snyder's utilisation of some slow motion, CGI and irrelevant narrative cutaways turn probably an hours worth of film footage into two - and it shows.300 attempts to build credibility on the ideals of loyalty and honour, but it is no 'Gladiator'. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed (the fast pace editing only illustrates this further) and the tight use of camera-shots fail to transpire on anything less than a very large television I did feel that this type of camera work in the battle/fight scenes was only employed to gloss over the poor choreography. I also felt that the lack of establishing shots prior to battle scenes failed to give any sense isolation among the Spartans or any feeling of companionship, the explanation of loyalty and camaraderie has only be left to the poor script. Snyder has tried too hard to stylise the fighting and battle scenes and although it looks good, it serves no real narrative purpose apart from a few moments, the most note worthy being the decapitation of the young Spartan and the scarring of Xerxes.Finally, the only gratification for 300 is for those that were fortunate to see it at the cinema or who have a 46inch HDTV, but if you're really after good visuals then buy an X-Box and indulge yourself in the cut-scenes of Halo 3 because that is that is where the films real competition lies, in a video game!",6,1,2,6 December 2007
