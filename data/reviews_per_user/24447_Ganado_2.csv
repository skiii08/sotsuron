3:10 to Yuma," Good Not Great
","I had fairly high aspirations for this film due to the acclaim almost everyone that I had spoken to was giving it. The thought that I hadn't seen this movie until it was finally released on DVD irked me in the sense that I would be missing the general theater experience that most movies deserve to be viewed in. I genuinely feel that '3:10 to Yuma' was that type of film.It wasn't that this movie was bad by any means, amazing actors such as Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, and Peter Fonda are enough to make any film fairly memorable. The thing that got me about this film however were the overused western themes and lack of complete realism. It sometimes felt hard to believe that characters could be using such profanity in America's early years while managing to dodge every bullet thrown at them.This appeared to me like the type of movie that you go to the theaters to see and really don't do much with it afterward. It's good enough to get the critical acclaim it seeks as a general thriller with lack of a building foundation. This movie is certainly not worth buying but for the casual moviegoer it's something that at least the men in your family will enjoy while it's on.",7,2,4,13 February 2008
Ghost Rider," Daredevil is no Longer the Worst Marvel Movie!
",The acting in this movie was laughable. I mean if you were to make a movie and pick pretty much some of the worst and most bland actors of all time you would get this film.Nicholas Cage's facial expressions were also making me crack up.When Nicholas Cage nails his face off of the ramp I was pretty much dieing of laughter as well.And lest we forget the giant age gap between him and Eva Mendes. When the two were teen sweethearts they were the same age. The he ages an extra thirty years and she ages like four or five.The best part of the whole movie however was when Peter Fonda says 'Nice Bike'. I practically peed my pants. Anything that guy says is funny. He can't be serious because his acting prohibits him from doing so.All in all I give this movie 2/10,2,2,5,4 March 2007
