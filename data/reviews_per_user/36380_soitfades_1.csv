Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Biggest Disappointment in the History of Cinema
","This is possible the biggest disappointment in the history of Cinema. The original Star Wars trilogy was very important for me when I was a kid. I remember the enthusiasm back in 99 when this came out. I was 18, not so big SW fan anymore, but definitely exited for new Star Wars movie and expectations were extremely high.So the movie begins. Star Wars logo appears on the screen, that familiar tune begins and prologue starts to roll. It was like a dream. Then the bad jokes, decent-at-best acting, lame dialogue and Jar Jar Binks took over.There was no plot. No interesting characters. No nothing. Goofy cgi-character stepping on turds on the streets of Mos Eisley was something I really wasn't expecting from the movie.The acting. Liam Neeson hasn't never been this average. He really looked uncomfortable in this role. Jake Lloyd was abysmal. Are you really telling me this sucker supposed to be Darth Vader? One of the greatest badasses of the Cinema? Screenplay was ridiculously bad. The kid referring Padme to angel etc. It was nearly unwatchable at times. And to the people who claim dialogue never was very strong in SW movies.. Get Real! It never was THIS bad in the old trilogy.I kept telling myself: 'This will get better. This will get better. This will..' and yes, eventually it did. I admit the lightsaber duel at the end with quite nice Duel of Fates was a good scene. But the annoying kid, Jar Jar and all others of his kind, the podrace, and nearly everything else before it was so lame no matter how great the ending would have been, nothing couldn't save this movie. It's a shame.4/10",4,1,2,13 August 2006
