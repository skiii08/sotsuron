The Rock," Odd plot twists, poor story line, unnecessary explosions
","This is a terrible movie.  Despite the 'star power' of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, it was unbearably bad.  There are ridiculous chases through the streets of San Francisco, ridiculous plot developments about a secret underground entrance to Alcatraz, and a bunch of morons shooting each other. I was looking forward to watching it, and came away immensely disappointed. For a fine action movie, try The Usual Suspects instead.",2,2,7,23 January 2000
