Marie Antoinette," Another vote for could've been great but not quite.
","Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' is an interesting, entertaining film that comes close to greatness, particularly in its creation of the bubble-like world of privilege and infighting, tempered by the earthiness of Louis XV, the kindness of Louis XVI, and the kindness and vivacity of Marie herself. It's very much on key there and I don't mind that Ms. Coppola backed away from trying to give us historical vignettes on the collapse outside the little world of Versailles. However for the film to really work, it needed either some grounding in the outer world of suffering France or at least a proper, utterly shocking blowout scene when reality comes crashing in. Instead we get a rather mild and tepid deflation. Just the historic, tragic scene of the royals trapped in their crashing little fairyland, their loyal handful of Swiss guards butchered, and Louis bravely facing the mob, Marie with him, earning the respect of a young Napoleon in attendance should have provided the material necessary. Louis and Marie certainly don't deserve more compassion and sympathy than their abused, starving subjects but setting them solely in the Versailles fairyland gives them the impression of having no role or responsibility...They're like pretty dressed dolls on display, with nothing to do, waiting to be broken, till the world suddenly makes them human again. And maybe to some limited extent that was part of the truth...But if so, then we need to see the explosion that made them come to life...And death.",Null,0,2,6 April 2007
The Prestige," Don't forget Rebecca Hall
","Not much to add to the comments about a film that will be remembered as an outstanding milestone in the careers of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Christopher Nolan. Except to note that Rebecca Hall turns in a heartbreaking performance as the loving, tragic Sarah, victim of her husband's obsession, despite his partial (not exactly the right word but what is) love for her. Her perceptive take on the secret defining her husband's twisted nature is the essential clue in the movie, though so subtly put that it's almost impossible to catch until that secret is revealed.What a year for great movies! 'Illusionist', 'Scarlet Veil', 'Prestige', 'Last King of Scotland', 'Babel', 'Scandal', etc, etc...And even the flawed films like 'Good German' had riveting performances. Film is back this year in a fantastic way and 'Prestige' is one of the, if not the, best.",10,3,5,21 March 2007
The Illusionist," The Illusionist
","I agree, a wonderful, truly awe-inspiring film, and likely to remain one of Edward Norton's most memorable performances in what is now sure to be the career of a great actor. In addition, Philip Glass' score was excellent, a perfect supplement to the beautifully muted cinematography. Watch for the carriage ride with the Crown Prince in disguise where his Chief Inspector played by Paul Giametti reminds one of Orson Welles. I wasn't impressed with Mr. Giametti in 'Sideways' but this film establishes his credentials. Rufus Sewall and Jessica Biel should also not go unmentioned-both are outstanding. Another thing that impresses about the film is the attention given to the lesser characters...The Manager, the mysterious Magician, the Doctor, the police aides. A piece of craft and a thing of beauty...You won't want Eisenheim's performance to end.",10,1,2,23 January 2007
Shrek 2," Shrek II excellent
","An excellent sequel that carries on the tradition of the first bringing several new and well-thought-out characters, particularly the delightful and delightfully wicked Fairy Godmother and the charming Zorro takeoff Puss-in-Boots. A happily married Shrek and Fiona are invited to her home kingdom of Far, Far Away by her parents who've no idea their plan for ending the princess' ogre-by-night curse has taken an unexpected turn. Shrek with forebodings of disaster reluctantly is persuaded to go, Donkey, undergoing some problems in his relationship with Dragon, hitches a ride, and the story moves us to the Beverly Hills-like kingdom of Far, Far Away where Fiona's parents King Harold and Queen Lillian are not exactly delighted to meet their new ogre-in-law.The original plot is deepened by offering details of how and why Fiona was locked away in her tower and the secret of her curse ends up being revealed in hilarious fashion at the end. Rupert Everett narrates a charming repeat of the fairy tale that opened the first Shrek and gives a great turn as the vain and rather nasty Prince Charming. Antonio Bandaras has great fun spoofing his Zorro character as the heroic if somewhat limited by his feline condition, Puss-in-Boots. But the show is stolen by the arrival of the Godmother, Fairy that is, brilliantly and hilariously played by Jennifer Saunders, who it turns out had a rather dark stake in ending Fiona's curse.",10,1,2,30 May 2007
The Fountain," Tremendous film reaching for the sublime...
","While this magnificent film should be seen in a theater it's worth it to see the DVD background and the intense devotion to the story by the various designers and crew caught up in the vision. Indeed, it's fun to see actors Jackman and Weisz pulling back a bit at times to poke a little fun at their roles. That said, there's little to add to the above reviews as to the film's imagery and beauty. I would suggest that the 'Future-2500' segments may come close to overreaching at times for some but for me were enthralling. The acting was outstanding and career-making for the leads and the support alike...The Grand Inquisator and the Francisan being two especially fine performances.Spoiler...My own view of the film follows a few others in feeling the 1500 segment is 2006 wife Izzy's book, her attempt to help her husband as well as herself deal with the inevitability of her death, while the 2500 segment is husband Tom's final chapter, written at her request in which he finally comes to terms with her death. The true ending for me is Tom planting the seed of the amazing Guatamalan tree which furnished a cure for both aging and cancer-one which came too late to save his wife- and then at last saying good-bye to her. But I'm probably being too pragmatic.A hard film for me to watch, sharing some of its issues, but one you should not miss.",10,1,3,8 August 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Best of the Dracule but...
","This is a marvelous film and Gary Oldman's is the outstanding Dracula performance, though he is ably abetted by tremendous special effects. The rest of the cast is likewise first-rate, and I would include Keenu Reeves' Harker, despite some problems, which some are too quick I feel to put on Mr. Reeves' acting abilities. In fact, he's handicapped by the script which creates a rather strange situation in which his wife, Mina, the reincarnation of the noble Princess of the Dracule, Elisabeta, is willing to betray the memory of her murdered friend Lucy, the valiant men trying to save her, and her own long-suffering husband in order to embrace eternal death with the fiend Dracula. Who, we are given to understand is not as hampered in his tormented existence as in the Stoker novel. He has retained the ability to understand right and wrong and made his choice after his wife's untimely suicide.In a final confrontation after Dracula receives his death wound, having pulled a gun on poor Harker, she, having chosen Dracula and an Unlife of murder and blood lust, demands he tell her if he will kill her as he has Dracula and Lucy's vampire. Harker is forced by the script to say that he would not...Though of course it would be an act of love to save her soul, one her so-called 'loving' Dracula is apparently not capable of. Had Reeves been allowed to give Harker some bite, call Mina on her actions, and set his love for her soul against Dracula's lust to make her his undead consort, I think the role would have been far more impressive.",9,1,1,20 February 2005
Iron Man," Fine retelling
","A fine retelling of the Iron Man story, with Stark, the best of the Marvel heroes because he is so believable...A genius who turns his near-dead body into a super-hero's through tecnnology not magic or alien origin, etc. Robert Downey, Jr. is right on form as Tony Stark, making him a bit less noble at start. Jeff Bridges plays a fine snarky nemesis and the story is solid as Stark seeks redemption for his past. The one drawback is Paltrow as the love interest...The chemistry just isn't quite there. However, the story is set early enough in the relationship and paced fast enough to carry you over the clumsiness of the feeling-out love scenes. Either Gwen's gotta go or they've gotta learn to strike some sparks. But, it's nice to see our greatest younger actor hit his stride again. May we continue to see him on a role.",8,2,5,10 February 2011
Blade Runner," Just an additional thought or two...
","I've loved this film as one of the great sci-fi classics and a classic film of any genre.  The only comment I would make is that I don't go with those who want Deckard's character to be a replicant himself...I've always felt it was far more effective to show that he, the human, relearns his humanity from those he hunts.  And it fits his weakness against Roy in the final scenes.",Null,0,1,2 August 2003
