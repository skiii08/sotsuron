The Avengers," Marvel...eous Amazing Movie!!!!
","Just when you thought 'Star Wars' movie series was the ultimate must see movie. Along came 'Harry Potter' leaving movie goers what's next. James Cameron 'Avatar' 3D. This feature will definitely not disappoint the lover of explosive, heart pounding, hyper-sonic, electrifying, larger than life characters, and 'super powered' movie. Nick Fury aka Samuel L. Jackson is a perfect fit ( S.H.I.E.L.D. director ). Looking forward for additional versions { part 2, part 3, etc. } This way the creator(s) can add new characters e.g. Wolverine, Fantastic 4, etc. then Marvel fans will get to 'experience' the real future Science Fiction @ its Best. I am now questioning, can Joss Whedon's Amazing and constant edge of your seat thriller be Topped?? Stay tuned.A brilliantly and wonderfully done story line, one liners, and the 'history' of each Super Hero. If you have the chance and love 'special effects' GO See this feature @ IMAX 3D. WoW!!!!! Enjoy",9,1,4,5 May 2012
