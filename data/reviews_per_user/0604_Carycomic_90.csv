Changeling," Whoa! Where to begin?
","I just got back from seeing this, and I am still overwhelmed. So, I'll begin by giving a definition of the title. A 'changeling,' in medieval folklore, was a child of the magical fairy-folk left in place of an abducted mortal child. So, using that to describe what the LAPD of 1928 tried to do, with regard to Christine Collins, is all too-apt.As depicted by Angelina Jolie, in this film, Christine is a single mom whose husband abandoned her and their son almost ten years earlier. So, she has been trying to make ends meet by working at the L.A. branch of the Bell Telephone Company as a shift supervisor. A job so hectic, she has to wear roller skates!Getting home late, from an emergency fill-in, she calls her son Walter in for supper...and gets no response. After an increasingly frantic search around the neighborhood, she calls the local police station. And, I must admit to being shocked at hearing that the '24-hour minimum rule' was in effect even eighty years ago!!Cut to a downtown L.A. train station five months later. Enter the boy from Illinois who claims that he is Walter. Despite her claims to the contrary, she is pressured into giving him shelter overnight. After giving him a warm bath before bedtime, though, she finds...surgical proof that the kid is definitely an impostor.You will see for yourselves just what the LAPD subsequently puts her through, rather than admit they might have made a mistake. Because, mere words cannot do it justice. I've gone to a lot of graphically violent movies before. But, even I had to close my eyes during several of the mental hospital scenes, alone!Clint Eastwood has truly directed another gut-wrenching masterpiece. That and his musical score--which I predict will be just as bittersweetly haunting as 'Beyond Tomorrow,' from the Al Pacino classic SERPICO--are bound to get Oscar nominations for those two categories. Likewise, the writing by J. Michael Straczynski (of BABYLON 5 fame) and the co-production of Ron Howard.Jeffrey Donovan, from TV's BURN NOTICE, does a pretty good job at making you hate Capt. J.J. Jones. Although, if he was trying to give his character a slight Irish brogue, I have to confess it sounded more like the Maine accent of that actor who used to appear in the Pepperidge Farm commercials!As for Jason Butler Harner? He reminded me of a young Dennis Hopper, with the suitably chilling way he played convicted child murderer Gordon Northcott.But, I think it's John Malkovich (as Rev. Briegleb), Gattlin Griffith (the real Walter), and Devon Corti (the fake Walter) who will probably all wind up being rivals for Best Supporting Actor. And, if none of my predictions come true? Then, shame on you, Motion Picture Academy! So, go see this movie, and bring plenty of tissue. Because, no one in their right mind will be able to keep a dry eye through this movie. And, I'm not ashamed to say that I certainly didn't.",10,8,13,1 November 2008
The Incredible Hulk," More of a remake than a sequel
","When I first saw the 2003 version, starring Eric Bana, I gave it 3.1 stars out of a possible five (with five=the best).This version gets _all_ five.For starters, we have a condensed origin/montage that's more reminiscent of the 1970's TV series than the 2003 movie. Absolutely no mention, or depiction, of Nick Nolte as the mad geneticist-father of Bruce Banner.Then, there's the series of tie-ins with the recently-released 'IRON MAN' flick. Equipment bearing the label of 'Stark Industries;' a cyberspace patch with the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on it; and an uncredited cameo by RDJ, himself.Last, but not least? We have the angst and poignancy that is a mandatory part of any decent Hulk story. A prime example is the segment where Betty Ross finds out that Bruce is back in the Big Apple. When he discovers that she's moved on with her private life (in the form of psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Samson), he tries to stay away. But, when they accidentally glimpse each other, she pursues him. Picking him up on a rainy stretch of highway in a reunion scene that you'd have to be a 'Star Trek' Vulcan to sit through with dry eyes.The main villain this time around, though, is Emil Blonsky. Relative English newcomer Tim Roth (well, he's new to me) plays him as a professional covert-operations commando who prides himself on being one of the toughest men in the world. That is; until Bruce 'Hulks out' on him, down in Brazil. He then becomes obsessed with getting a rematch on equal terms. And, he has very little trouble persuading Gen. 'Thunderbolt' Ross to arrange just that.As played by William Hurt, Ross is even more of an unsympathetic super-patriot than Sam Elliot's version was. Perhaps, because Hurt might have been drawing on the same sinister streak that made him so frighteningly believable as Kevin Costner's alter-ego in 'MR. BROOKS.'Either way; much as I enjoyed Eric Bana's portrayal of the Hulk, five years ago, Edward Norton's was twice as good. And, if you're wondering if Marvel Studios is already at work on sequel? Take a close look at Mr. Blue's forehead after Blonksy becomes the Abomination.That's all I'm saying...till then. ;-)",10,2,5,15 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Wow! If this is the final sequel, then it's going out with a bang.
","Ethan Hunt is back, and semi-retired. He now merely trains IMF agents, because he's now engaged to a beautiful doctor named Julia. And, Julia thinks he's merely a traffic flow analyst for the Department of Transportation!But, he is forced to come out of semi-retirment when he learns that Lindsay, his female protégé(played by Keri 'Felicia' Russell), has been captured by Owen Davian. An infamous international supplier of anything and everything a terrorist group could want.The rescue fails when a nitroglycerine capsule, implanted in her brain, explodes. Causing cerebral hemorrhage.After that, comes an unauthorized-yet-successful mission, to Rome, to capture Davian, himself. Unfortunately, in a sequence that will inevitably be compared to Robert Davi's escape in LICENSE TO KILL, Davian is rescued on American soil with inside help.This leads to Julia getting abducted, and her safe return is the incentive for Ethan to steal a biohazardous McGuffin code-named 'Rabbit's Foot.' I won't spoil the rest for you. Suffice it to say that the action sequences are more intense than in the first two movies. And, the suspense is almost literally unbearable! If this is the swansong for Tom Cruise's version of the legendary TV classic, then I found it a thoroughly enjoyable one.Btw, the term 'McGuffin' was coined by Alfred Hitchcock to describe whatever is the center of attention in a thriller like this.",10,4,8,7 May 2006
Skyfall," Better than CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE, put together!
","And, for me, that is saying a lot.Because, for me, CASINO ROYALE was pure rubbish, the way it dispensed so cavalierly with James Bond's back-story as established in some of the previous movies! Which, in turn, is why I boycotted QUANTUM OF SOLACE, altogether.But, because this was the golden anniversary of 007's film debut (and because they didn't want Albert Broccoli spinning in his grave), Eon Productions decided to make up for all the continuity errors that had made CASINO ROYALE such a disappointment for me. They _loaded_ SKYFALL with references to previous films!The sarcastic reference to exploding pens, by new Q? And, the bittersweet reference to the deaths of 007's parents when he was still a boy? Both date back to GOLDENEYE.The trampoline-like leap to freedom off the back of a Komodo dragon? An allusion to the crocodilian hop-scotch in TO LIVE AND LET DIE. And, the vintage Aston Martin with ejector seat and machine gun-toting headlights? From GOLDFINGER, of course! In short? This third entry, in what I will initially call 'Daniel Craig's 007 trilogy,' has alleviated the fear I once had that one of the longest-running (and most beloved) of all film franchises had been irreparably torpedoed.Thank you, Mr. Craig and Eon Productions, for proving me wrong. :-)",10,8,20,12 November 2012
The Ring," AM I GOING JAPANESE? I DO NOT THINK SO!
","The last foreign film, with English sub-titles, that I sat through was 'Cousin, Cousine.' I rented it after watching the American remake with Ted Danson. I much prefer the latter.  That is why I will--most likely--NEVER rent the Japanese original of 'the Ring!'  That being said, let me point out the only TRUE con, re: the American version. *Possible spoilers ahead.* It should have been released PRIOR to 'Fear.com,' which was about a jinxed computer website.  'The Ring' (either version) is about a jinxed videotape. I was still properly scared by the latter.  Even saw it a second time!  Just the same, I give it two stars--compared to three stars for the former--simply because 'Fear.com' came out two weeks earlier.  And, that I deemed TOO scary to see a second time!!",Null,1,2,13 March 2003
Underworld," I wonder if this was inspired by those White Wolf RPGs?
","* Warning: possible spoilers.*  I mean, it certainly could have been. The sourcebooks for 'Werewolf: the Apocalypse' and 'Vampire: the Masquerade' firmly establish a centuries-old enmity between the two subspecies.  And, internecine rivalry among vampiric clans, as well!  The CGI effects are undeniably great.  The werewolves, in particuliar, are more fierce-looking than even the best of the prosthetically-costumed doubles from 'the Howling' series of videos!  The one con I have is more of a nitpick. I WISH THIS MOVIE HAD NOT DIGITALLY-AMPLIFIED THE HARDROCK SOUNDTRACK!  This movie was enjoyable enough at normal decibel-level.  Thus, only 3.99 stars.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Episode 3.5?
","Ever since the publication of the 'Admiral Thrawn' trilogy launched the Star Wars Expanded Universe, there have been many stories that have made admirable attempts to fill in the crucial historical gap between 'Revenge of the Sith' and 'A New Hope.' Namely; the events leading up to that fateful transmission of the Death Star 1 plans to Princess Leia. But, once George Lucas sold the franchise to Marvel-Disney, he relegated all those SWEU stories to the status of non-canonical legends! Now, however, we _have_ a canonical explanation. And the telling of it is done brilliantly and poignantly.We have new characters like Jyn Erzo (the daughter and only child of Death Star 1's reluctant chief architect) and Director Krennik (the ambitious Imperialist who wants full recognition and sole credit for the battle station's existence). Then, we have the return of old favorites like Governor Tarkin and Princess Leia, herself. The former played by a different actor; the latter, vocally reprised by Carrie Fisher; but, both of them the recipients of ingenious computerized face- matting!I'm not going to reveal anymore than this, because that wouldn't be fair to the extreme spoiler-phobes among those of you reading this. Suffice it to say that, if you're a true Star Wars fan to any extent, you will love this filler prequel as much as I did. Believe me; it is worth the seven bucks.",10,3,8,17 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Everything that SHAZAM should have been...but wasn't.
","This movie was action-packed from beginning to end. SHAZAM wasn't.The action was nicely balanced by suspense. SHAZAM wasn't.The comedy relief was genuinely funny without being needlessly self-parodic. SHAZAM wasn't.Brie Larson as Carol Danvers kicked butt almost from the start. Billy Batson didn't.Djimon Hounsou, as Korath, kicked butt almost from the start. Djimon Hounsou, as elderly wizard Shazam, didn't.And Goose, as the flerkin, was just so irresistibly cute! Mr. Mind, at the tail end of SHAZAM, wasn't.In short? The money you were thinking of spending on SHAZAM? Spend it on on this film, instead. For the first time, if you haven't seen it, yet. And, if you have? It's definitely worth an encore attendance (like the one I just got back from)!",10,3,13,6 April 2019
Passengers," The SILENT RUNNING of the 21st century.
","I first saw that cult-classic forty-four years ago, at the Warner Theater in Torrington. It starred Bruce Dern as Earth's last tree- hugger, willing to spend the rest of his life alone (except for three maintenance robots named for Donald Duck's nephews) safeguarding a veritable ark full of biospheric domes. Domes full of plant life that a post-apocalyptic Earth government apparently doesn't think worthy of replanting during the recolonization of Earth!Well, this movie is similar, if not identical.Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston. A mechanical engineer seemingly thawed out of cryogenic hibernation, by accident, following the starship Avalon's collision with a rogue asteroid one-third of the way toward Homestead II (a prospective Earth colony). Laurence Fishburne plays Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso; a member of the crew likewise accidentally thawed out ahead of schedule (although, two years after Jim). And Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane; a beautiful journalist who gets thawed out in between.The only difference, in her case, is that Jim woke her up, deliberately!The poor guy was lonely. And, for the first twelve months after her awakening, she eases that loneliness. Vice-versa, too. But, Arthur the android bartender blabs the truth to her, and the romance goes temporarily awry. This is when the audience gets the real sense of things starting to go majorly wrong. You see, Arthur was specifically ordered _not_ to blab! So, why did he disobey? Because, the ship's governing A.I. is starting to lose power! Causing everything to gradually go haywire aboard the Avalon. That's why I don't think Jim and Gus' reawakening was accidental, after all. I think the A.I. programmed their thaw-outs as part of some contingency plan. Of course, I have no proof of that. That's just a glorified wild guess on my part.I enjoyed this movie more than I initially thought I would. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer rivals that between her and Josh Hutcherson in the 'Hunger Games' films. And, it's _definitely_ steamier than the so-called romance between Chris and Theresa Saldana's characters in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! The only reason I don't give this a perfect ten?I wish the film's happy ending had included an uncredited cameo by Josh Hutcherson as Jim and Aurora's son. Ah, well! They say you can't have everything. So, I guess I'll settle for this being my last rave review of 2016.Happy New Year, folks!",9,9,16,31 December 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," I'm pretty certain this will be a trilogy to rival 'Back To The Future.'
","It looks like we have another trilogy, folks.Yes! That's what I said. Because, the final scene of this movie has a cliffhanger ending, similar to 'BTTF 2.' Which, in turn, leads me to hope that 'POTC 3' was filmed simultaneous with this one! Regarding 'Dead Man's Chest?' The first half of this movie reminds me of that cult-classic, 'Nate and Hayes' w/Tommy Lee Jones. Particularly, the part where Will Turner has to rescue Capt. Jack and his crew from cannibalistic Carib Indians.From there, things heat up, as everyone tries to get to the eponymous chest, first, once the mystery of its contents is solved! Some of you, however, might be a little disappointed in that revelation, as a similar gimmick was used in 'Brothers Grimm.' Even so, I loved this movie just as much as the first one. Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth is still beautiful and feisty. A suffragette centuries ahead of her time. Orlando Bloom (as Will Turner) is still honest, gallant, and courageous. And, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow still has selfish method to his madcap-ness.As for Bill Nighy, who plays Davy Jones? The Lovecraftian make-up job on him, and the rest of the Flying Dutchmen, can only be described in one word: EWWWWWW! In short: set sail for the nearest movie theater, me hearties. And, then, drop anchor for the next rip-roarin' 2.5 hours.",10,2,5,8 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Where to start? Decisions; decisions!
","*AVAST THERE, MATEY!  SPOILERS, DEAD AHEAD!*  This movie harkens back to the Disney live-action comedies of the Fifties-to-Seventies.  Funny jokes; non-graphic spookiness; fast-paced action; special effects that live up to the name; dialogue that doesn't condescend to the audience; and, of course, great swordfighting.   In fact, the swordfights could rival anything from the old 'Zorro' series (starring Guy Williams), or the climactic duel in 'Hook' (starring Robin Williams)!!  Some of the sight-gags from the actual ride are also present, and faithfully re-enacted. *That dog, for instance, was smarter than all four of those prisoners put together.*    And, best of all, it's rated PG-13, rather  than. . .AHRRRR!  So, forget all those Terminators, Hulks, and Angels.  Weigh anchor and shamelessly set sail for this flick!",Null,1,2,10 July 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," I just got back from seeing this.
","It was a lot better than the previous movie (hereafter referred to as STAR TREK: THE NEEDLESS REBOOT). But, that being said, there is still way too much room for improvement. For one thing; the Klingons have been revamped yet again! From guys with bluish-gray skin and curly hair, to burly guys with bumpy foreheads and hippie-length hair, we now go to guys who look like rip-offs (oops! I mean, 'pastiches') of Lou Gossett Junior's character from ENEMY MINE.If that's going back too far for those of you under 25, then imagine the space-lizards from V. Only with lobster-red skin.The only reason I give this five stars is the cameo by Leonard Nimoy, as the older (a.k.a. one true) Spock from the alternate 24th century. That; plus the admittedly poignant death scene that serves as a surprisingly legitimate homage to the similar scene in WRATH OF KHAN.In short; this sequel is alright. But, it's still got more than a few yawn-worthy scenes. Which is a few too many for my peace of mind.",5,10,22,17 May 2013
Knives Out," Rian Johnson proves he's far better at drawing room whodunits than science fiction.
","I went to see this, at a second-run theater, expecting this to be the 'Dude, Where's My Car?' of murder mysteries. But, I actually found myself enjoying this! And I attribute that as much to the collective talents of the cast as the brains of the director (who, quite frankly, had a lot to make up for after SW:TLJ).First off, there were Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer. Those two, of course, contributed greatly to the box office success of the Anglo-American remake of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. So, no, it doesn't surprise me that history repeated itself with this movie.Then, there's Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. She proves, here, that she can scream insults at (fictional) dysfunctional relatives as easily as she can scream in horrified distress at a machete-wielding impersonator of William Shatner. While he proves just as versatile at playing an unfaithful husband as he has at playing street-wise undercover cops and aging ex-hippie widowers in romantic comedies!Chris Evans, as H.R. Drysdale, is also surprisingly good at breaking away from his superheroic images as Johnny Storm and Captain America. While Frank Oz was initially unrecognizable, to me, as the Thrombey family lawyer. But, it's a credit to his non-Muppetry acting skills that he was even funnier in this role than he was as Yoda!Last but not least? Ana de Armas, as Marta, is a newcomer to me. But, she does a superb job of playing the courageous Latina nurse misguidedly carrying out the last request of a recently deceased patient. And, if I were as kind-hearted as Marta, I'd restrict my unselfishness to the only two Thrombeys who truly deserve it: Meg and Nana! The latter, as Harlan's mom, is a hundred years-old if she's a day. And, thus, she has very few alternatives left as to how she spends the rest of her life. While the former (though a little naive when it comes to life outside her 'green-collar' family) is genuinely sincere in her egalitarian beliefs.In short, I was delightfully kept guessing from beginning to end. And I'm dead certain most everyone else who goes to see this will feel the same way.",10,0,4,6 January 2020
Blade," Marv Wolfman should be proud!
","Because this film adaptation gets better and better, every time I see it. Though I hate to admit it, I remember the TOMB OF Dracula issue that Blade first debuted in,...AND I NEVER BOUGHT IT! How I mentally kick myself, today. Back then, he wore a brown leather safari jacket, way-cool green goggles, and an Afro halfway in size between Richard Roundtree (the original 'Shaft') and Clarence Williams III (the original 'Mod Squad Linc'). He got revamped (no pun intended) in the early Nineties as an African-American samurai, and that's how Wesley Snipes has immortalized him. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE!* The final showdown, between Blade and Deacon Frost, has special effects that will inevitably be compared to 'Matrix' or 'Crouching Tigers, etc. etc.' Even so, this movie justly deserved to have a sequel, and I eagerly await the next one (rumored to be scheduled for a 2004 release date).",Null,1,3,6 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Things have come full circle. Or, have they?
","OK! Just as there was no actual depiction of Jack Sparrow being captured, between 'Curse of the Black Pearl' and 'Dead Man's Chest,' so it is with 'At World's End.' Specifically; we--the audience--do not actually see Lord Beckett coerce the captain of the FLYING DUTCHMAN into working for the (thinly-disguised) British East India Company. It is merely referred to in explanatory exposition. Backed up, a little bit later, by the discovery of the Kraken's corpse.That, however, is this film's only flaw. The rest of it is just as delightfully macabre as the first one. From the opening action-packed sequence in Singapore (where Barbosa, Elizabeth, and Will have to steal a map to the Gateway of the Afterlife). To the purgatory where Jack Sparrow commands a crew of hallucinatory clones of himself. From the revelation that the FLYING DUTCHMAN is actually supposed to be guiding the souls of those who recently died at sea. To Elizabeth's shocking discovery that her father is one of those recently deceased.Yet, the biggest surprise of all (and I mean that, literally) is Naomie Harris. Her character, Tia Dalma, turns out to be more than just a French West Indian voodoo priestess. She's actually Calypso, the ancient sea goddess! Man! What terrific CGI in her transformation scene. Including what might have been a subtle double-entendre (although, I have no way to prove it).In short, this film is well worth the price of admission. So, I'm only going to post one more spoiler. The ending hints at the possibility of a POTC 4.We can but hope, me hearties!",10,5,8,1 June 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Well, I finally got a chance to see this! So, where to begin?
","Surtur's dungeon, I guess. With no montage to back it up, Thor tells this long-dead skeleton how he wound up in chains inside a glorified bird cage. And the back- story is a little vague; referencing a search for something called the 'Infinity Stones.'Hearing this, I thought to myself: 'Say what?! What installment did I miss in this franchise?'But, I quickly forgot that in all my excitement over the opening battle! Which, by the way, was fought to the tune of Led Zeppelin's famous Wagnerian pastiche ('ah-ah-ahhhhhh!' and all). But, then came the first of several surprises.Heimdall; replaced as Bifrost gatekeeper by a low-rent Viking named Skurge?Loki; posing as a suddenly--and uncharacteristically--hedonistic Odin?And the real Odin: somehow rendered amnesiac and then marooned on Earth (perhaps as an adviser to stranded Autobots)?What the heck is going on, here?????It turns out to be a Machiavellian ploy by Odin to deal with the coming of Hela, 'goddess of death.' In this film, she is not depicted as Loki's daughter (and, therefore, Thor's niece) as she is in classical Norse mythology. Rather, she is Thor's long-lost older sister! And, boy, is she p****d off. Killing Thor's three favorite warrior companions (blond Fandral, redheaded Voltstagg, and Lapp/Sami-like Hogun the Grim) with almost laughably easy speed, she makes Skurge her personal executioner. A deal he soon regrets accepting!Thor's ultimate show-down with them (including a reprise of Led Zeppelin) is capped off by a desperate gamble that's equal parts Trojan Horse and 'Hail, Mary' play. The ploy succeeds, of course. But, at a terrible price.And, no; it's not the death of Jane Foster! Apparently, she's already dumped the 'god of thunder' before the movie even begins. No in- story reason given. The real-life reason was probably casting unavailability on Natalie Portman's part. In any case, I deducted one star for her absence.I deducted another star for turning the Grandmaster from a blue- skinned, nearly omnipotent Elder of the Universe...into an anorexic-looking version of that Roman fop from GLADIATOR. The one who tried kissing Joaquin Phoenix's butt with that 'Battle of Carthage' fiasco?In short; this is a pleasantly action-packed little time-killer on its own merits (as with the first two Thor films before it). But, with regard to being integral to the cinematic saga of the Avengers, as a whole? Not really. Not unless the opening scenes of their next flick serves as prequel to the opening scene of this one!",8,3,7,15 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," I was the youngest member of the audience where I saw this!
","I have seen only three Woody Allen movies that I've really liked. The first was the science fiction parody, SLEEPERS, co-starring Diane Keaton. The second was A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, co-starring his then-wife, Mia Farrow. And, this new one makes three!And, that's kind of ironic, now that I think about it. SLEEPERS dealt with a man who was cryogenically frozen in the 1970's, only to reawaken a hundred years later in a quasi-dystopian future that's equal parts George Orwell and Groucho Marx. Whereas, in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, Woody dealt with a group of Victorian-era couples who were torn between how they felt about their attraction to each other's spouses in the physical world versus what might happen to them, in the next world, if they acted on those feelings.Now, he deals with a guy who feels literally born out of his time. What the pedantic Ray calls 'Golden Age thinking.' One of the few things he spouts off about that I agree with (and, probably, so did the rest of my fellow movie-goers, who were mostly over 60!).Gil Pender idolizes the Paris of the post-World War I 'Lost Generation.' But, Adriana--the model/costume designer he gradually falls for in that period--idolizes the 'Beautiful Epoch' of the 1890's. And, in trying to hang on to her, when they inadvertently visit the latter era, he has a brilliant realization. Nostalgia, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder!What each of us regard as the 'Good Old Days' weren't entirely good at the time. And, the times we live in now aren't entirely bad. Although, the trick to having a life-long relationship, in these modern times, is finding someone who shares those feelings. Someone not addicted to just the here-and-now (like Inez and her parents). Yet, someone who can also revere the past without naively worshipping it!Gil is lucky in the end. He finds his soul mate. Of course, he had Woody Allen (who, I believe, also provided most of the background clarinet music in this film) helping him from behind the scenes! The rest of us have to manage, more or less, on our own.Don't let that stop you from enjoying this little gem, however. Especially, if it can provide you some much needed laughs of the old-fashioned (= non-raunchy) kind.",10,1,5,11 June 2011
Zodiac," One word: whoa!
","I was a class-room clown, in grammar school, when most of the events, in this highly suspenseful true story, took place. So, all I knew about the Zodiac Killer, before getting into see this movie, was that he had never officially been caught.And, now I know why.The first-third of the movie is undeniably the creepiest, as the actual murders occur, and you hear voiced over recordings of the killer anonymously phoning the cops to virtually brag about it! That's also where you're introduced to Robert Downey, Jr. as a cynical, semi-alcoholic, and apparently gay crime reporter; Jake Gyllenhaal as an editorial cartoonist with an obsessive-compulsive penchant for puzzles and cryptographs; and Mark Ruffalo as the SFPD detective who ultimately--and unfairly--bears the lion's share of responsibility for never bringing in the killer.How the murders, and the mocking letters that gradually outnumber them, affect each of the above-mentioned characters is what makes the final third of the movie less (inevitably) boring than the middle third. Gyllenhaal, especially, makes you want to scream out loud, at the movie screen: 'Get a life, you idiot! You're wife is right!' Some of you are probably asking yourselves, right now, why I don't give this a perfect ten, if I liked it so much. Simple: the semi-fictionalized murder scene at the lake. The disclaimer at the start of the film said that the whole thing was based on actual case files. But, if neither the man nor the woman--so brutally stabbed at the lake--survived, how did Robert Graysmith get that part about the Zodiac Killer claiming to have escaped from a prison in Montana?",9,3,8,5 March 2007
Spider-Man: Homecoming," I don't know if continuing to amalgamate Ultimate Marvel-verse with the mainstream is a good thing.
","Yeah, I admit Tom Holland does a good job recreating the Everyboy role of Peter Parker with the same convincing plausibility that he demonstrated in 'Capt. America: Civil War.' But, I'm not sure Latinizing the character of Eugene 'Flash' Thomson is such a good idea. As his bullying of Peter makes him seem like an anti-Caucasian racist jerk!Then, there's Michael Keaton as Adrian 'The Vulture' Toomes. He does a pretty good job recreating the comic book version's origin (re: being an unfairly cheated small-time businessman). And making Phineas 'The Tinkerer' Mason his techno-whiz second-in-command was an equally clever touch. But, I still didn't feel as sorry for him as I felt towards the dysfunctional Osborne family (Norman's not Ozzie's) in the Toby Maguire flicks! So, I have to rule the director's attempt to make The Vulture a slightly more sympathetic character an undeniable failure.Last, but not least: who the heck is Zendaya?! And is Michelle 'MJ' Jones going to turn out to be related to Rick, Jessica, and Angelica?Combine all that with the increased swearing (only the absence of f- bombs making this PG-13 rather than R) and you have a Spidey film not even half-way as close to being family-friendly as the Raimi trilogy. So, stick to WONDER WOMAN.",5,4,9,9 July 2017
Final Destination 2," As a rule, sequels usually suck.
","This sequel is indisputably an EXCEPTION to the rule!  *Borderline spoiler.*  It's an especially clever plot device, having the new lead actress seek out the one from the first movie.  In this case, tracking her down to a mental asylum, where's she had herself committed.  Most times, there's only a verbal or photographic link to characters in the originating movie.  In short? I've no doubt that the popularity of this movie, in video rentals, will prompt a second sequel.  *Hopefully, not made directly for video.

Suicide Squad," Blows STAR TREK BEYOND, JASON BOURNE, and GHOSTBUSTERS 2016 out of the water!
","Okay; now that I've got your attention, let's get down to the nitty- gritty. For those of you who aren't overgrown fan boys and girls, this film is loosely based on a DC comic that first started publishing in the 1980's. The concept no doubt having been inspired by the enduring popularity of THE DIRTY DOZEN. But, with the reluctant recruits being modern super-villains rather than court- martialed American GI's during World War II!The plot of this movie is likewise from the 1980's. More specifically; it's loosely based on the Succubus/Incubus story arc involving the magical anti-superheroine called the Enchantress. As originally depicted in DC Comics, in the late Sixties, she was as magical as Zatanna...and yet dressed like Mrs. Peel. But, by the Seventies, that had all changed. Perhaps because non-DC readers kept confusing her with the Asgardian super-villainess of the same name over at Marvel.In short; she was the first DC do-gooder to go bad. And all before 'Crisis On Infinite Earths!'This 21st century film version goes one step further. It not only updates the character of June Moone into a former archaeologist (a la Indiana Jones). It consolidates the Silver Age origin of her character with both the post-COIE revision and La Encantadora (the Latina revamp that was created in the late Nineties)! Then, we have Jared Leto's Joker. No purple tuxedo for this dude! He's performed just the way Frank Miller depicted him in that now-classic graphic novel 'The Dark Knight Returns.' Basically, a sociopathic albino Goth who just might laugh both ways (if you catch my drift). And, as blasphemous as this might sound? I find that take on the character even scarier than Heath Leger's posthumous Oscar-winning portrayal!Other than these two alterations (plus, the Afro-Americanizing of Deadshot by having him portrayed--almost too convincingly--by Will Smith), the movie stays pretty close to the basic premise of the original comic. For the most part, however, this is a straight-up sequel to BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Which, as I noted in my review for that film, was inspired by both the Frank Miller epic and the introductory 'Doomsday' story arc in Superman's comics (in the early Nineties).Need I add that Margot Robbie practically steals the show as Harley Quinn? I thought not. Go and enjoy.",10,19,40,4 August 2016
Elf," Not too bad!
","*If you hate spoilers, do not read this before Christmas!*  I'll admit it. The primary reason I went to see this had nothing to do with holiday spirit. It was more like morbid curiosity.  I mean, let's face it: BOB NEWHART IN TIGHTS??!   Well, once I got used to the sight, I quickly got into the main plot of the movie.  James Caan and Mary Steenburgen were their usual (consumate professional) selves.  Relative newcomers Daniel Tay and Claire Lautier are definitely going to get more film roles.  And, so will Zooey Deschanel (who does her own superb singing on the soundtrack)!  True; this was geared mostly for the seven-to-pre-teen demographic.  *There's even some light-hearted jabs at some of the Rankin/Bass classics.* So, the thirty-plus crowd might want to fake several trips to the rest room or the snack bar during the lamer (from a grown-up's p.o.v.) jokes.   Even so, it's a lot more family-friendly than most other stuff out there.  So, even though I'm a few weeks early, 'Happy Holidays'(and enjoy the flick)!",Null,0,1,8 November 2003
Doctor Strange," I just got back from seeing a Wednesday night sneak preview.
","And I have to admit...it was pretty impressive.Let me start the requisite elaboration by stating that I am one of the few who will willingly admit that I not only clearly remember the 1978 TV-movie with Peter Hooten in the title role and the late, great Sir John Mills as the Ancient One (aka 'Thomas Lindmer'). I also thoroughly enjoyed it. So much so, in fact, that any on-line Marvel movie pastiche I read that mentioned the good doctor automatically had me picturing Mr. Hooten as him!Well! It took them thirty-eight years. But, Marvel and Hollywood finally found someone who can measure up to Mr. Hooten: Benedict Cumberbatch. Better known to BBC America fans as 'Sherlock' (the original inspiration for CBS' ELEMENTARY).His portrayal of Stephen Strange is a little more faithful to the Silver Age origin story by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. As in; a highly successful surgeon whose brilliance is only eclipsed by his narcissism. Only to lose his ability to perform delicate life-saving operations because of nerve damage to his hands resulting from a car wreck. The only difference being that he is not reduced to Tony Stark-level drunkenness in a waterfront bar when he hears about the Ancient One (by eavesdropping on a nearby merchant sailor).Another difference from the comic book origin is that the Ancient One's sanctum is not some underground hermitage magically carved out of a Himalayan ice cave. Instead, it's a Buddhist-like temple in the modern Nepalese city of Kathmandu. And, where comic book Mordo was an unscrupulous, power-hungry Transylvanian baron, in this movie he's Afro- European (possibly half-Romanian/half-Ugandan?). With the initially same unconditional belief in the Ancient One that Obi-wan Kenobi had in Anakin Skywalker!As to the Ancient One, 'himself?' Instead of being portrayed as an elderly male Korean mage, he is portrayed by English actress Tilda Swinton (who did such a masterful job playing the androgynous archangel Gabriel opposite Keanu Reeves as DC's CONSTANTINE). While Rachel MacAdams plays Dr. Christine Palmer. A character originally published in a 1970's Marvel comic called NIGHT NURSE!It's not for these mild departures, however, that I'm only giving this movie nine stars instead of a perfect ten. Nor is the deduction based on lack of decent good-vs-evil action. Rather, it's the visual effects used to depict the gigantic face of Dormammu (Dr. Strange's arch-enemy). In the comics, he's always drawn with a head of flickering flame and pupil-less eyes. As if he were the love-child of the Human Torch and Little Orphan Annie!In this film, though, his eyes not only had pupils. His whole head looked more like a giant hologram of the Red Skull's face! That might be a lot more sophisticated than the Nameless One of the TV-movie (who, in 1978, looked more like a Ray Harryhausen animation). But, more sophisticated doesn't always equal better...as any disappointed fan of the 1997 re-release of the original STAR WARS trilogy can vouch for!All that being said, however? I would still recommend that everyone who enjoys the good doctor's comic book adventures should go see this movie a.s.a.p. Because I was most definitely _not_ disappointed in it. And, believe me; if I had been? This review would have been twice as long-winded in my expression of that disappointment!So, let the Winds of Watoomb whisk you to your nearest multiplex without further delay.",9,3,7,3 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Forty-two years in the making...and well worth the wait.
","I was eighteen when I first saw 'Episode 4: A New Hope' (then simply known as STAR WARS). And I was blown away by it! Just like most everyone else in the world. In the months that followed, I read most of the magazine interviews with George Lucas that all boiled down to the same thing. There was going to be three trilogies! The first one, detailing the overthrow of the evil Galactic Empire. The second one, detailing how the Empire first came to power. And the third, detailing how the remnants of the Empire were finally eradicated, once and for all.Unfortunately, by 1983, the cost of non-computerized special effects had become so expensive, a lot of movie theaters had to charge special evening rates...which, nowadays, are considered 'bargain' matinee prices!That's why it took sixteen years to bring The Prequel Trilogy to the silver screen. A lot of SW fans seemed to be disappointed with it! But, I put that down to just being sad that it had to have an unhappy ending for Anakin Skywalker, Obi-wan Kenobi, et al. Me? I just accepted it as inevitable and waited to see if there would be third trilogy.It took another decade, and Disney buying Lucasfilm, to accomplish that. But, again, I was pleased with Episodes 7 and 8....for the most part. The battle scene that culminated with up to a dozen AT-AT's bombarding Jedi Master Luke Skywalker with turbo-laser fire was a little too reminiscent of the Battle of Hoth (from Ep5:TESB) for my peace of mind.I understand that such similarities are why a lot of SW fans were displeased with Episode 9. But, I have no complaints! I'm glad that everything was able to come full circle, with the old characters helping the new characters to tie up loose ends.
For example: Luke finally mastering Yoda's X-wing levitation trick. Leia, being able to pass on some of the Force techniques, that her brother showed her, to Rey. And Han Solo's 'ghost' reconciling with his wayward son.I also like how the screen writers were able to adopt some more elements from the 'Star Wars Legends.' For example: the reborn Emperor Palpatine; the introduction of the True Sith from the Unknown Regions; and the Black Fleet (from the Yevethan Trilogy of paperbacks).The really important plot twists, of course, I will keep secret for all those reading this who haven't gone to see it, yet. Just take my word for it. This movie really does cover all the bases, most satisfactorily. You should be proud, George. I know I am!,",10,9,24,22 December 2019
The Bourne Ultimatum," The action-adventure espionage genre is Re-Bourne!
","This has been the most anticipated summer release of 2007. Those who were disappointed by FF2 and SPIDERMAN 3 have gotten an emotional shot-in-the-arm with BOURNE ULTIMATUM. And, the contents of that injection are pure adrenaline! The movie takes up almost immediately where it left off. With Jason having confessed his sins to the Nevskis' orphaned daughter, and then escaping from the Moscow police after some kind of suppressed memory flashback.Then, six weeks later, he reads about himself and something code-named 'Blackbriar' in a London scandal rag. Right away, he knows the CIA will probably have the reporter who wrote the story under surveillance, and slips the guy an unmonitored cellphone bought at an open-air vending booth! That the reporter gets killed anyway is due more to the latter panicking than anything else. But, Jason manages to confiscate the reporter's little black book and finds the probable source of the story in Madrid.It's there that he meets CIA cyber-nerd Nikki Parsons, yet again!!!And, here, we get a somewhat startling revelation. She and Jason might have had a thing going, back in his original identity. Whoa! Makes me almost sad they didn't get to actively rekindle it. Yet, the pain of Marie Kreutz's death is obviously still too recent to get over. Tastefully done, on the writers' part.After that, comes the much-talked about Moroccan roof chase and the NYC car chase. In between, Pamela Landy learns about the true extent of Operation: Blackbriar's activities...and Bourne's real name. Nicely spliced in from the epilogue of the second movie, by the way.I don't normally leave this long-winded a review. That goes to show you how much I loved this flick! The only reason I don't give this a perfect ten, however? They edited out my favorite line from the previews. The one where Pam is describing Jason to Blackbriar's armchair agents.'He's very good at staying alive. And, trying to kill him--and failing--just pisses him off!'",9,3,6,6 August 2007
Watchmen," Everything that 'The Spirit' should have been, but (sadly) wasn't.
","Alan Moore? You should be proud. Hollywood was actually 99% faithful to your graphic novel! The only thing they changed about it was the plot-device for averting World War III.In the graphic novel, Ozymandias cloned and mutated the brain of a human psychic. A brain that had memorized certain unpublished s.f. stories, plus images of a diorama meant to resemble an extra-terrestrial landscape. Basically, a variation on 'The Architects of Fear,' which was a classic episode of the original b/w OUTER LIMITS about a plot to unify the Earth through the global fear of an alien invasion from outer space. One that would never materialize, of course! But, one which the frightened people of the world couldn't take the _chance_ of never occurring.And, I suspect that's the episode of OUTER LIMITS that was being aired on Dan's TV set , at the end of the film.I paraphrase my opening statement, however, when I say that--in all other respects--Hollywood was surprisingly faithful to the source material. And, that delighted me, no end!",9,0,2,8 March 2009
Justice League," This movie hammers the stuffing out of 'Thor: Ragnarok!'
","I don't know what film the so-called professional critics were bad- mouthing. But, they obviously didn't watch this one. The multiplex auditorium I saw this at was nearly packed to capacity. And that was just for the early evening show!Ben Affleck returns as Bruce 'Batman' Wayne rallying all those super- beings whom Lex Luthor was interested in.Jason Mamoa as Aquaman: not blond and clean-shaven like the comic book version. But, at least he doesn't have a trident-shaped prosthetic hand or over-exclaim the word 'Outrageous!' And, even better? He _does_ wear the orange chain-mail shirt in battle.Ezra Miller as the Flash: perhaps a little more nerdy than Grant Gustin (his TV-counterpart). Yet, he's just as fast...and just as loyal to his framed-for-murder dad.Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman: now in the hundredth year of her exile from Paradise Island. Yet, still the most amazing Amazon mankind has ever seen.And Ray Fisher as Victor 'Cyborg' Stone: hacker supreme with butt- kicking physical moves to boot.How the Dark Knight of Gotham City brings the rest of them together is half the appeal of this movie. The reason why he brings them together is a trio of mcguffins known as Mother Boxes. Apparently, Steppenwolf of the so-called New Gods needs them to phone home! But, Batman has different plans for them. How those plans ruin Steppenwolf's you'll have to see to believe...and enjoy. Suffice it to say, however, most of you will be delightfully surprised.Speaking of delightful surprises; there are even a couple of sneaky epilogues, during the ending credits, that are so good they're almost Marvel-ous! In other words: shell out that six or seven bucks at the box office. I guarantee you that this will be super-worth it.",10,20,37,17 November 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Let me see if I have this straight.
","*May be some spoilers.* According to the Architect, in 'Matrix Reboot,' the Machines kept 90% of their cryo-captives under control by letting the other 10% become rebellious. And, then, crushing the rebellion at the greatest moment of false security!*Sort of a periodic systems purge.*But, Neo Point Six differed from the five previous 'generations' by choosing girlfriend over greater good, this time around. Because of this divergence, he is now in a position to overpower the now-virus-like Agent Smith. All this, hopefully done BEFORE the Machines breach the outer defenses of Real-life Zion City!!There's only one question this otherwise-spectacular third and final installment does not answer. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE COAT-CHECK GIRL??*Until they do, I only give this 3.7 stars.*",Null,1,2,8 November 2003
Man of Steel," I give this movie nine stars!
","I don't know what the heck the critics were talking about. This was a pretty good movie, in my book! Maybe not quite as good as the ground-breaking original version that made Christopher Reeve a house-hold name. But, it was definitely a _lot_ better than the Brandon Routh version.For one thing, there was no over-reliance on Lex Luthor, as the arch-enemy, this time around. There was also a refreshing slant on depicting Kal-El's formative years as Clark Kent. Instead of a straight-forward biographical progression, we get flashbacks more typical of the old 'Kung Fu' series (that starred the late, great David Carradine). And, believe it or not, these help to advance the story. Not only by showing the valuable life-lessons imparted to young Clark (as he gradually discovers his superhuman abilities) by Jonathan Kent. But, also, how adult Clark recalls them just in time for Superman to use them against General Zod!My only complaint with this movie? The climactic duel was a little _too_ drawn out. Hence, the nine stars. Other than that? I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed.",Null,2,2,14 June 2013
The Village," Once again, previews act as misdirection.
","*quite a few spoilers*   This movie seems to fall in between 'Sixth Sense' and 'Signs,' quality-wise.   It isn't as good as the former.  But, it's way better than the latter.  And, while you enter the movie theater, thinking it's going to be an outright thriller, it gradually becomes a touching love story. The movie starts out with the funeral of a child, in what appears to be an Amish-like community, circa 1897.   This increases the resolve of the normally introspective blacksmith Lucius Hunt to bring some much needed medical advancements to the Village.  This, in turn, helps him admit his love for the somewhat clairvoyant blind tomboy played, so sweetly and convincingly, by Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter).   I won't spoil the twist ending, except to say that I was half-expecting something along that line.  And, while it was a stroke of genius, Mr. Shyamalan (pronounced 'Shom-a-lon') seems to be sending an even vaguer message than he did in 'Signs!'  I have an older brother who thinks the events in the latter film were all part of a faith-restoring dream sent by God on behalf of Mel Gibson's character.  But, with 'the Village,' I don't know whether the moral of the story advocates a similar approach to dealing with modern problems. Or, if it's pointing out that, sooner or later, every Garden of Eden invariably gets its share of snakes.  I would like to think it's the second one.  In any case, I give this...3.1 stars (out of five)!",Null,2,2,2 August 2004
21," I have to agree with Max-787 on this one.
","I went to see this movie, earlier this afternoon, because Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne were in it. And, any film in which they appear is pretty good, more often than not. This film, however, was one of the 'not's.'I mean; the premise was initially intriguing. And, some of the banter thrown about, by the various characters, was surprisingly somewhat funny! But, past the ninety-minute mark, I began to get bored. I actually ceased caring about Ben Campbell!His gradual transformation from 'the Anakin Skywalker of MIT' to 'the Darth Vader of black-jack' was so predictable, to describe the rest of the film as 'less-than-riveting' would be putting it charitably. So, I walked out. Completely uninterested in knowing whether or not Ben got the girl and/or the Harvard medical scholarship. Nor will I waste any money on the eventual DVD to find out.In short: the early promise shown by this movie gets broken really fast. And, not even Messrs. Spacey and Fishburne can change that.",1,26,39,29 March 2008
Over the Hedge," Steve Carrell is ten times funnier, as Hamilton the Squirrel, than he was as 'the 40 Year Old Virgin!'
","Seriously, though: I loved this movie! Bruce Willis does a great job as the voice of RJ. A kleptomaniacal raccoon who makes the mistake of robbing the human junk-food hoard of Vincent the Bear (voiced by Nick Nolte, as a sort of anti-Yogi).So, he journeys to a nearby housing development called Rancho Camelot, to replenish Vincent's stockpile. This community has all-but-overrun the woodland habitat of some just-awakened hibernators, led by Verne the Tortoise (voiced by Gary Shandling). And, his penetration of the wall-like hedge bush surrounding their small patch of woods leads to a semi-hilarious encounter with human suburbanites.Enter RJ, who volunteers to 'instruct' them on how to take advantage of discarded human food.He and Verne naturally disagree on this point, at first. Resulting in an absolutely hysterical sequence that climaxes with a rocket-propelled red wagon taking both of them sky-high!Just before they crash back to Earth, Verne looks at RJ and utters those bound-to-be-immortal words:'You're the Devil.'How RJ gets out of his impending jam with Vincent will bring tears of joy to both your eyes, and your kids (assuming you have any). P.S.---listen closely to the voice of Father Opossum, and see if you can guess just...which...STAR TREK...veteran...it...is.",10,1,1,26 May 2006
Wanted," More like 'Hit Man: the Movie' than 'Wanted' the g.n. mini-series.
","Some you may be puzzled by the preceding statement. So, I'll explain.The graphic novel mini-series took place in a world where thinly-disguised pastiches of DC Comics' super-villains had finally achieved victory.The 'Hit Man' movie had a bald assassin, raised and trained by some age-old secret society, going rogue when he learned that he had been framed for an assassination that he technically never committed. Sort of like Lee Harvey Oswald.James MacAvoy, as Wesley Gibson, plays essentially the same character. With the only differences being that he initially has a dead-end job; he's not bald; and, Angelina Jolie plays his personal trainer.Boom chick-a wow-wow!In addition to all that, Morgan Freeman plays Mr. Sloan the same way he played Keanu Reeves' boss in 'Chain Reaction' (that political thriller about cold fusion). Smoother than the skin of a snake. And, just as dangerous to get too close to while the snake is still in it!Speaking of Keanu Reeves; the scenes that simulate the enhanced physical prowess of the Fraternity's assassins are reminiscent of the VR training sessions between Keanu and Samuel L. Jackson in 'The Matrix' trilogy. Which is why I can't give this movie a perfect ten.They're a little _too_ similar for my comfort. Almost to the point of ruining the movie!I do like the underlying questions asked by the film, though. How much of what happens in our lives is predestination? And, how much is the result of our own actions/inactions? Or, to put it in even simpler terms, as a result of the train-wreck scene: if it's okay to kill one person to save thousands, does that make it equally okay to kill dozens just to get one?",9,2,6,29 June 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Saw this again, for the first time, on FX Channel.
","And, it was as great as I remembered.  Furthermore, it was a lot more faithful to the original than the current sequel!  *Warning: spoilers ahead!*  For starters, Linda Hamilton's voice-over prologue firmly establishes that the original took place in 1984.  So, young John is not (repeat: NOT) thirteen, in this film.  More like ten-going-on-eleven.  That, in turn, would make the older version of John (in the current sequel) twenty years old, rather than twenty-three.  Assuming, of course, that the current sequel takes place only two years from now!  Also, if the time machine mentioned in the original film was destroyed right after Kyle Reese was sent back, then T-800(Model 102) must've been sent roughly simultaneous to Kyle.  In which case; HOW DID MODEL 103 GET SENT BACK FROM 2032 (THREE YEARS AFTER THE FINAL VICTORY OVER SKYNET HQ)?   I guess what I'm trying to say is that Vajna and Kassar should've quit while they were ahead, with this movie, just as Stallone should've left well enough alone with four Rockies.",Null,0,0,7 July 2003
We're the Millers," The Millers are like the anti-Griswolds...and, for them, it works.
","First off, I will confess that I've never heard of Jason Sudeikis before. I recognized Emma Roberts from HOTEL FOR DOGS, Will Poulter from CON: VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, and even Jennifer Aniston from that NBC sit-com she used to do ('Pals' was it?).But, that being said, I reluctantly have to confess that I absolutely _loved_ this movie!Sudeikis was totally believable as a small-time pot dealer who's well-earned cynicism is balanced by a frequently obvious yearning for a real-life family a la 'The Brady Bunch.' While Aniston and Roberts are equally believable as a stripper who knows she can't give lap dances forever, and a street-smart tomboy who's fifteen-going-on-fifty, respectively.Poulter, however, steals half the show as an adolescent virgin abandoned by his alcoholic mother. And, yet, he's still as chipper as Peter and Bobby Brady, put together, in the optimistic way that he looks at the world.The way that these four come together as a real family, while on the run from both the Mexican Mafia _and_ the somewhat kinky Fitzgerald family, is what provided most of the belly laughs for me. And, if those of you reading this can suspend your disbelief for the film's full running time, it will do the same for you. Especially, because of the gag reel, at the end!The only reason I didn't score this a perfect ten, however? The spider bite scene. The full frontal male nudity should have made this NC-17. I would still have gone to see it! But, at least I wouldn't have been taken unpleasantly by surprise during that one particular scene.",9,8,18,11 August 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I literally walked out in the middle of it.
","Now, usually, I have a greater-than-average tolerance for cinematic stinkers. I've sat through 'Cabin Fever;' 'Dude, Where's My Car;' and 'What About Bob,' in their collective entirety. But, this one? FORGET IT!!! The premise was undeniably interesting. And, there were definitely some good laughs, early on. Yet, as the movie continued, I began to laugh less and less. I mean, come on! Blabbing Andy's card-game confession to the rest of the store's personnel? Nowhere, in real-life, would Dave, Cal, and Jay have had ANY right to do that! And, if they were really his friends, they wouldn't have even THOUGHT of doing it, in the first place!Then, there's the scene where Dave--still drunk after some kind of big matchmaking luncheon, where he ran into an ex-girlfriend--starts videotaping his anatomy, front and back, from the waist down. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORE, DURING BUSINESS HOURS!!! And, all the female boss does is send him home for the rest of the day? Nah-uh! If I'd been that boss, the real-life remedy would have had a lot more permanence. But, the last straw, for me, was that stupid soft-spoken argument between Trish and the dorky fat kid over a pair of tin-foil disco boots with goldfish in the water-filled glass soles. Something along the lines of, 'I know your stuff is just an exhibit for what you sell on Ebay. But, since I'm already here, anyway, why I can't just buy them, right now?' That did it! I went to the men's room, and flipped a coin. Heads; I would return to my seat, and literally suffer through the rest of it. Or, tails; I'd go to the neighboring town of Winsted and see Disney/Vanguard's 'Valiant.' Obviously, it came up tails. In short: if it's a choice between remaining a virgin you're whole life; and finally getting some action, via the dubious help of alleged friends like Dave, Cal, and Jay, then I say...BETTER NEVER THAN LATE!",1,15,35,20 August 2005
Ratatouille," Surprisingly nice entertainment on a dull summer afternoon.
","Patton Oswalt--whose appearance on the Jay Leno Show makes me think of him as a straight Nathan Lane--is perfectly cast as the voice of Remy. A rat who feels he is born to cook food, rather than steal it from human garbage cans. Of course, the only thing standing in his way is that old human stigma about rats being diseased vermin.Enter young Linguini, who later turns out to be the son of Remy's idol; the late, great master chef Auguste Gusteau (voiced brilliantly by Brad Garrett). Linguini wants to cook in the worst way...and that's initially how he does it! That is; until Remy learns how to control Linguini's actions by pulling on the latter's hair.Between the two of them, they manage to put Gusteau's Restaurant back on the five-star map. Despite the worst actions of the jealous Monsieur Skinner, who's been using Gusteau's name and likeness to sell the most horrible kinds of frozen food!Along the way, Remy reconciles with his traditionalist dad (voiced by the great veteran character actor Brian Dennehy). And, Linguini not only wins the heart of the lovely assistant chef Collette. He also impresses the aptly-named food critic, Anton Ego (voiced by the legendary--and lovably eccentric--Peter O'Toole).In short, this is more than an old-fashioned love story. It's also a charming fable about not letting others dissuade you from what you really want to do with the rest of your life. Not if you're truly serious about it, to begin with. And, I will be slightly disappointed if this doesn't become the sleeper family hit of the summer.P.S.---I can't help wondering if those New York City McDonald's rats got started this way?",10,1,2,10 July 2007
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This more than makes up for the Matthew Vaughn travesty X-MEN: LOW CLASS.
","For starters, it provides a suitable explanation for Stewart-Xavier's restored mobility in the flashback prologue of X-MEN 3: THE LAST STAND. It also provides a suitable substitute for the character of Robert Kelly, who was the predestined target of assassination in the original Chris Claremont comic book story. But, who (as played by Bruce Davison) was killed off in the very first X-MEN movie, as all true fans of that film remember.The mutant rebels in the opening action scene were also intriguing. In addition to returning favorites like Iceman, Shadowcat, and Colossus, there were also relative newcomers Bishop (no mistaking those dreadlocks!) and Sunspot. Although, I have to confess; Adan Canto, the actor portraying the latter, bore a slightly greater resemblance to the actress who played Callisto in X-3! In fact, I was thinking to myself, while watching the opening battle of this film: 'Is this supposed to be Callisto's dystopian future-son by Cannonball?!'Then, there's Peter Dinklage who played Bolivar Trask. I loved it when he played Arthur Ramsey, the egotistical mental giant recruited for the alien-busting Federal task force in THRESHOLD (the short-lived, and criminally under-rated, 2005 CBS sci-fi series). And, the believability he brought to that role he transferred to his depiction of Trask with absolutely no trouble, at all!For me, however, the highlight of the film was the new meaning Bryan Singer gave to the old phrase, 'a meeting of the minds,' when he had Stewart-Xavier telepathically confer with his younger self (convincingly played, once again, by James MacEvoy).In short, then, I think the X-men movie franchise has been safely re-secured. Thanks to Bryan Singer being once more at the directorial helm.",10,1,2,24 May 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Eleven years in the making...and worthy every minute of the wait.
","The movie doesn't waste time with any recapitulation. It assumes we, as the movie-goers, are already familiar with what happened in the preceding movie. And, so, it starts off with a bittersweet opening scene at the Barton family picnic.As in, Mr. and Mrs. Clint Barton and their three lovely children.From there, we--the audience--are shown the ultimately fruitless aftermath. Not just three weeks into the future (where Thanos is anti-climactically executed by Thor). But, five _years_ into the future, as well!I don't want to spoil everything for those of you who haven't seen it, yet. Suffice it to say that the solution to the problem (inspired by Paul Rudd-as-Scott Lang) makes great use of all the past films. Both stock footage and new scenes ingeniously spliced together!*Of course, this wouldn't be a Marvel film without a little poignancy sprinkled throughout. Cap, as a grief counselor trying to believe every word he's telling to his 'patients.' Tony Stark, as a man trying to be just as brilliant at being a father as he was an inventor. And Bruce Banner, trying to hang on to the miraculous integration of his brains and the Hulk's brawn.Of course, there's also some comedy relief in the form of an overweight Thor and an out-of-place Rocket Raccoon!In short, we--the audience--at the movie theater where we saw this did just as we were supposed to; we laughed, cheered, clapped, and cried. And in all the right places. Especially the climactic battle scene against Thanos' past self...and his army. Of course, being a battle, not all the Good Guys come out alive. A lot of the returning characters (those 'finger-snapped' out of existence by Thanos in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR) don't survive this second encounter with him. But, any watery eyes the rest of you get over the sad stuff will almost immediately be cancelled out by tears of joy.In short? If you go to see this movie, you will enjoy it. I guarantee it. And if you don't? Then, you must've gotten soul-gemmed!

The Butterfly Effect," Imagine if 'Somewhere In Time' had been directed by Brian De Palma.
","This movie would be the result.  *Warning: one or two spoilers ahead.* The theme of this movie is atonement.  And, in the role of Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher more than atones for mega-flops like 'Dude, Where's My Car?'! The time-travel effects are pretty impressive, as are the memory catch-up sequences.   There's one slight blooper, however.  When Evan 'remembers' Tommy's headstone, there is a brief shot of the deathdate.  IT READS 1980! Yet, that portion of the film is supposed to take place a few days after the kids sneak in to a theater to watch 'Seven' (starring Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt).  AND, THAT WAS RELEASED TO THEATERS IN 1995!   I may have been wrong about the date of the Meiji Rebellion ('Last Samurai' did get it right; go figure!).  But, I am not wrong about this.   That is why I only give this movie three-and-a-half stars, as opposed to a perfect five.",Null,1,3,1 February 2004
Mamma Mia!," My folks found it funnier than I did.
","Me? I found it slightly funnier than GET SMART: THE MOVIE. But, only to the extent that I was able to sit all the way through to the 'Waterloo' number during the ending credits.Aside from that? It was just a musical remake of BUONO SERA, MRS. CAMPBELL. At least, as far as I'm concerned.For those who might not remember it? BUONO SERA, MRS. CAMPBELL is an old Gina Lollabrigida movie where she has told each of three GI's she met, during WWII (Telly Savalas, Peter Lawford, Phil Silvers), that her daughter is also theirs. In MAMMA MIA!, each of Sophie's possible fathers were counter-cultural teens during the 1980's. And, _none_ of them were told by Donna--Meryl Streep--that one of them had fathered Sophie.That and the Abba songs are the only major differences between the two films. But, again, only as far as I'm concerned. As stated way above, both my parents thought it was hysterical.The only belly laugh I had, however, was seeing Pierce Brosnan in that blue jump suit during 'Waterloo.' Oi vay (and I'm not even Jewish)!",5,2,4,20 July 2008
Batman Begins," The best version since Michael Keaton's Bat-debut, circa 1989.
","*Potential spoilers* And, the best portrayal of pathos in a silver-screen Bruce Wayne since George Clooney! *Who, by the way, I do NOT blame for the box-office failure of the previous one. His Bat-costume's designer is the one who should have apologized, on national TV, for disappointing the American movie-going public! But, I digress.* The underlying theme of this version is that age-old question: is there a difference between justice and revenge? Christian Bale, as a pre-Batman Bruce, says that 'sometimes they're the same thing.' Katie Holmes, as ADA Rachel Dawes, strongly disagrees. Yet, ironically, her grasp of morality is as naively simplistic as Ducard/Al Ghul's. They both see morality as black-and-white, while Bruce has learned the hard way that it's various shades of gray. He even says as much when recounting how stealing an apple was the only thing that kept him from literally starving to death! It's that realization which gives him the inner strength to defy Ducard (masterfully played by Liam Neeson), and spare the adulterous Chinese farmer in that flashback. I eagerly look forward to whatever sequel the WB might already have planned. Bob Kane would be proud of this movie. So, should Keaton and Clooney. And, I-- definitely and shamelessly--am.",10,3,5,15 June 2005
Zulu," Undeniably ageless classic!
","*Might be a few spoilers.* According to most military history websites, the real-life British garrison had plenty of time to safely evacuate Rorke's Drift, before those two-to-three thousand Zulus reached the ex-mission. Why didn't they? Most likely the real-life Chard and Bromhead's 'bloody egos' (as Heindorf the Afrikaaner refers to them). Stanley Baker--as producer--was probably well aware of this. And, so, this movie is an ageless classic in the sense that its anti-war message will never grow old. At least, not from the p.o.v. of anyone in their right mind! Don't get me wrong. The action scenes never fail to provide me a great adrenaline rush, every time I watch them! But, then follows the come-down. And, if vicarious viewers, like me, feel a slight sense of shame, at viewing all those who didn't survive the battle, imagine how a real-life soldier must feel! What Stanley Baker--in the role of Lt. Chard--calls a 'butcher's yard.' In short, this movie is both exciting and thought-provoking. Definitely ten stars!",10,3,5,5 January 2004
Seabiscuit," Not bad! Not too bad at all.
","*SPOILERS AHEAD!*  As with most any movie adapted from non-fiction, this one has been 'semi-fictionalized for dramatic purposes.'  Red Pollard's family were destitute long before the Great Depression.  A big flood had wiped out their Edmonton brickwork business.   And, ill-fated Frank Howard was not Charles' only child.  He had three others, by his first wife.  In fact, by taking Marcela Zabala as his second wife, Charles Howard technically became THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF HIS OWN OLDEST SON, LIN!  *How Freudian is that?*   But, all that aside, it was still a nice, entertaining bio-pic.   And, I especially loved Chris Cooper's portrayal of Tom Smith. If he doesn't win 'Best Supporting Actor' at next spring's Oscars, I'll be unpleasantly surprised.  I give this four stars!",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
28 Days Later...," The automatic confirmation seems to have been premature.
","So, here's a slightly-revised second attempt. *Warning: possible spoilers.* With the possible exception of Ms. Harris, I am totally unfamiliar with any member of the all-British cast. But, make no mistake; Cillian Murphy will definitely become more well-known to American audiences as a result of this movie. Why, even the late great Michael Landon started out as a teenage werewolf! This movie, however, is more like the first Charlton Heston movie I ever saw in theaters. I'm speaking, of course, of 'The Omega Man' (which was, itself, a remake of Vincent Price's 'The Last Man on Earth'). The plague in this movie, however, does not result in albinistic pseudo-vampires or reanimated corpses. It's more like a fast-acting mutation of rabies. Emphasis on 'fast!' I literally jumped in my seat during the prologue in the animal research lab. And, twice as high during the scene in Jim's house! In short, despite all the nay-saying going on, this is a SUPERB THRILLER. Definitely not a sequel to that Sandra Bullock dramedy. And, undeniably way better than 'CA: Full Throttle.' A perfect ten!",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
Avengers: Infinity War," Wow! Just---plain---WOW!
","How to review this film without 100% spoilage? Well, let's start with the high-jacking of the refugee ship from THOR:RAGNAROK. It comes under attack by Thanos, who manages to whup Thor and the Hulk almost too easily. Enter the Guardians of the Galaxy and Dr. Strange. The latter aiding Iron Man and Spidey against two alien mercenaries (Roughouse and the Metal Master?). While the former rescue a comatose Thor (who now resembles a Silver Age Nick Fury minus the cigar) from outer space.  This leads to the mandatory explanation about the Infinity Stones and the various aspects of existence they control. And wouldn't you know it? The Vision has one of them in his forehead! Enter two more alien mercs (Bloodscream and Pip the Troll?) who go after him and Wanda Maximoff in Scotland. Only to have their butts handed to them by Captain American and Company (with Cap now resembling Ringo Starr)! From Scotland, this group goes to Wakanda while Iron Man, Spidey, and Dr. Strange wind up on the Saturnian moon of Titan. All these different story threads finally coming together in an opening battle that totally surpasses the turning point Battle of Eckthelion from LOTR: ROTK! Marvel Studios has been building up to this moment for more than a decade. Some of their previous films, in this shared universe, have been more lackluster than blockbuster. But, this was not the case, here. I sat through every second of it and I was not disappointed! Nor was anybody else in the packed house that showed this flick, earlier tonight. Sure, there was a cliff-hanger ending! But, I knew that there was one coming from the start. After all; there's only so much you can put into a nearly three hour-long movie with a cast of characters this big. Rest assured, though. The Good Guys will whup the Bad Guys! How? I don't know any more than you do. Personally, I hope the sequel features the cinematic debut of either Adam Warlock, Quasar, or Capt. Mar-Vell of the Kree. Yet, Marvel Studios might surprise me (and everybody else) by introducing none of those three! Two things everyone should remember, however. 1) The Confederate Army's victory at the First Battle of Bull Run didn't guarantee them victory in the American Civil War. And... 2) This film is PG-13. Which means it 'might' prove unsuitable for hyper-active, attention-deficit children, under the age of five, who erroneously think they're the Flash!",10,6,16,28 April 2018
Bolt," I have _always_ preferred Happy Endings. Even when _I_ was an 18-35-year-old!
","And, BOLT continues to preserve that sacred Disney tradition.The dog of the title is a white German Shepherd puppy who's been raised to believe that he truly is a super-powered canine crime-fighter. But, through a certain string of circumstances, he is separated from his child-star owner Penny. Forcing him to team up with cynical, streetwise alley cat Mittens and hero-worshipping hamster Rhino in order to re-unite with her.This film has something for everybody. The younger kids will love it for three reasons. The sweet sub-plot of a naive, overly-sheltered pet making new (animal) friends. Plus, the comedy relief supplied by regionally different pigeons. And, of course, Bolt trying to perform in real-life the stunts he does on his show...and failing ('It must be the Styrofoam!').Grown-ups and older kids, meanwhile, will love it for the semi-good-natured way the movie pokes well-deserved fun at the business side of show business. Especially, as personified by that obnoxious agent/manager!In short, folks: if you want an unhappy ending? Watch the first five minutes of the 6PM news. If you want the polar opposite? Go see this film, completely guilt-free. You'll love it. No matter what your age-demographic!",10,3,5,30 November 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," This particular third time is undeniably the charm.
","In fact, tonight makes the third time in a row I've seen it! And, as with the first two movies, there are some changes from the comic books.Marrow becomes a male mutant called 'Spike.' African-American Quill becomes 'Kid Omega,' Chinese-American. Psylocke goes from telepath to telekinetic light-refractor, capable of making herself invisible. The Blob is now able to alter his own weight and density. And, Callisto not only has two good eyes. She can sense other mutants' powers, and run with Quicksilver-type speed!These changes do not detract from the movie, however. Rather, they make it all the more exciting! They did for me, anyway.And, while Halle Berry told WIZARD Magazine that this is her last appearance, as Storm, I'm pretty sure this will not be the last X-sequel. Not from the part that comes at the tail-end of the ending credits!In fact, that part makes me wonder if X-MEN 4 might involve Proteus McTaggart. Only time--and success at the box office--will tell.",10,36,62,2 June 2006
X-Men: Apocalypse," Just got back from the Opening Day matinée and...
","...there were only nine other people besides myself in the theater!For once, however, I do not regard that as ill-tidings of a box office flop. Because as far as I could see, all ten of us enjoyed it, immensely. Everybody certainly stayed glued to their seats till the ending credits!Anyway; the movie begins in ancient Egypt during the 37th century BC. En Sabah Nur, the mutant Pharoah, is overthrown by some of his normal human guards who know that he is no god in the divine sense. Unfortunately, he accidentally gets revived in the 20th century by CIA Agent Moira McTaggart! More specifically, 1983 (ten years after the events of X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST).A lot of things have changed in that time. For one thing; Magneto has reformed to the point where's he a steel mill worker in Poland, with a wife and nine year-old daughter, Nina! For another; Mystique is no longer impersonating William Stryker due to the fact the real one has not only resurfaced. He's also somehow latched on to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in an uncredited farewell appearance in the role...if one is to believe all the advance rumors), once again! Of course, once again, mutaphobic humans (in the form of small town Polish cops) are responsible for the deaths of Magneto's loved ones. Persuading him to join forces with En Sabah Nur and the other Three Horsemen. One of them is a relatively new addition to the cast of movie mutants: Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Sexy blue leotard and matching thigh-high boots, included! The other two are a teenage Ororo 'Storm' Munro (played by Alexandra Shipp) and a Warren Worthington III (played by Ben Hardy) somehow born twenty years earlier than the Angel character in X-MEN 3!**Unless the temporal divergence in the previous film caused Warren Worthington Jr. to inherit the angelic wings.I won't spoil the rest of it. Suffice it to say that the special effects and the social commentary, underlying the superheroics, are as top-notch as ever. My only nitpick--hence the one star deduction--is the hindsighted critique of STAR WARS: ROTJ. With all due respect to Ms. Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner)? There was nothing wrong with _any_ of the movies in the original SW trilogy! They were each equally good, as they were originally shown in theaters, from 1977 to 1983. It's only George Lucas' needless ret-conning, in 1997, that screwed them up! In short, then: go see X-MEN: APOCALYPSE. I guarantee you'll have a great time. Up to and including the rather...sinister epilogue.",9,5,10,27 May 2016
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Just as angsty and action-packed as SPIDER-MAN 3. But, in only half the time.
","I was half-expecting another over-hyped, big-budget disappointment. Yet, to my surprise, I actually and thoroughly enjoyed myself! The same group dynamic that made these four so believable in the first movie is back. As is--and I was even more surprised, by this (despite his name being present in the opening credits)--Victor Von Doom!!The movie starts out with suitable eeriness, as the Surfer arrives on Earth, causing several weather anomalies reminiscent of that Demi Moore cult-classic, THE SEVENTH SEAL. With one of them occurring over a certain castle in Latveria.Reed Richards, multi-tasker that he is, has been analyzing these phenomena while pretending to be focused solely on his upcoming wedding to Sue Storm (their fourth attempt, as it turns out). Basically, he builds a miniature radio telescope that's capable of tracking the Surfer's cosmic energy signature. Which, in turn, leads to the Surfer crashing the wedding party and, thereby, ruining it.On top of all that, the now-famous chase scene--with the Surfer and Jonny Storm--makes the Human Torch's atomic structure unstable. Allowing him to switch super-powers with any or all of his teammates!Of course, that was really just the script writers' way of allowing Jonny to literally walk in the shoes of the other three. Because, he is, as Capt. Frankie Raye so accurately points out, '...self-obsessed to the point of narcissism.' Thus, giving him a much-needed (and, perhaps, long-overdue) lesson in humility and unselfishness.If only SPIDER-MAN 3 could have gotten that point across a little bit sooner, it might not have tanked so badly at the box office.In any event, I loved this movie, immensely. I especially loved the tweaking of Galactus' appearance. Instead of a flesh-and-blood giant in purple armor, we get some kind of sentient energy being who camouflages himself in a giant cloud of interstellar smog!The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten? It's plausible that Reed could extrapolate, via computerized backtracking of the Surfer's energy trail, what other star systems the latter had visited. Yet, how could he know what planets in those systems had been drained of all life? And, how could he figure out the length of time it took?If anybody can think of a plausible answer, feel free to post it on the gray message boards. Seriously!",9,3,6,17 June 2007
Grudge Match," A good-natured send-up of the movies that made them famous.
","I confess it. I had never of Sylvester Stallone prior to the original ROCKY. I had never heard of Robert DeNiro prior to RAGING BULL. And, I had never heard of Kevin Hart until this movie!Stallone and DeNiro have proved more versatile, over the years, than most of their fans give them credit for. The latter, in particular. Prior to AWAKENINGS, DeNiro only seemed able and/or content to play the same type of character; a blue-collar loudmouth who swore in thirty-second spurts every five minutes like clockwork! But, I'm glad to say that changed (or, perhaps, just my appraisal had) in the twenty years following that.Even so, it's nice to see him back in the type of film role that helped make him a household name among all those who weren't old enough to see TAXI DRIVER in movie theaters.As for Stallone? He and Alan Arkin--as 'Lightning Lou' Conlon, 'Razor' Sharp's aging coach--have great screen chemistry. From their hilariously straight-faced parody of Stallone's now-classic use of frozen beef as a punching bag. To Arkin's accapella 'mating' dance while Razor is on the telephone, trying to arrange a date with his ex-girlfriend (played by the still-beauteous Kim Basinger).The only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect ten? Kevin Hart's performance as Dante, Junior. I'm sorry, but there's no gentler way to put this.Hart sounded like he was competing in a Chris Rock Sound-alike Contest...and losing!Other than that, I enjoyed this film, immensely. Much to my pleasant surprise. :-)",9,1,6,6 January 2014
Transformers," The Marvel Comics book was never like this!
","That's right, folks. In between the toy line and the Saturday morning cartoons, there was a comic book. Similar to the one inspired by the GI JOE mini-figures, only better.Well, I never thought a live-action movie adaptation would do the Transformers any justice. But, Steven Spielberg has a habit of proving even the worst critics wrong. And, to quote Jon Voight's character from a certain Disney movie, with Nicholas Cage:'I've never been so happy to be proved wrong.'The storyline is pretty simple. Both races of Transformers have come to Earth seeking the All-spark. The mysterious object that gave their planet mechanical life (sort of a Rubix cube version of the pylon from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY).Scorponok the Decepticon attacks an American military base in the oil sheikdom of Qatar, in order to scan the Internet. When he fails, Frenzy--a Decepticon shaped like a portable radio--takes over aboard Air Force One.In the meantime, L.A. high school student Sam Witwicky gets a vintage Camaro as a present for improving his grades. And, he and his new girlfriend (sexy tomboy Michaela) find out the Camaro is really Bumblebee of the Autobots! Apparently, as the descendant of a 19th-century Arctic explorer named Archibald Witwicky, Sam is the only one on Earth who might have the co-ordinates to the location of the All-spark...and Decepticon leader Megatron.It's at this point that the two sub-plots, which kept interweaving throughout the first third of the movie, finally dove-tail. And, in an action-packed way that also pays homage to other sci-fi classics, such as WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953 version), THE ARRIVAL, MEN IN BLACK, and THE TERMINATOR.How the Good Guys triumph over the Bad Guys is as thrilling as it is poignant. And, the pyrotechnics--both CGI and genuine--are awesome. In short: I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. With the two-and-a-half hour running time elapsing as if it were nothing.But, then again; when it comes to science fiction, I'm usually pretty easy to please. With Spielberg, in particular, rarely disappointing me (can you say, '1941?').",10,2,10,4 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A mixed blessing that this will be the final trilogy.
","On the plus side, this film had the long-awaited return of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. Not to mention, the debut appearance of Supreme Leader Snoke in the flesh (so-to-speak, as it's really a CGI version voiced by Andy 'Gollum' Cerkis), as well as a further development of the Force-enhanced psychic bond between Ren and Rey. And, of course, the ironic final appearance of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.*On the minus side, Snoke's first appearance is all too brief as he gets killed off before we finally get to know how he came to power in the first place.** While Adam Driver (as Kylo Ren) sports a hair-do that makes him look more like Severus Snape, Junior! And the cliff-hanging battle scene is a little _too_ reminiscent of the Battle of Hoth from SW: TESB.In short? I'm glad I went to see it. But, I'm even more glad that Episode 9 will end this third and final trilogy (as George Lucas originally envisioned his 'Star Wars' consisting of).* Ironic in that we finally get to see Leia actually use the Force with as much butt-kicking expertise as her brother!**Was he a souped-up clone of Palapatine; a Ragithian Human Darksider; or a renegade elderly Mace Windu?",7,1,3,18 December 2017
Logan," The third and final chapter in one of Marvel Films' greatest cinematic trilogies.
","In X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, we learned that Logan was born in pre- Victorian England as James Howlett (half-brother of the youngster who would grow up to be Sabertooth). We learned how they became mercenaries in every major conflict in world history. And, we learned how he became a Cold War spy/commando whose skeleton became laced with adamantium in an attempt to create the ultimate living weapon.In plain old WOLVERINE, we learned how he saved the life of one of his Imperial Japanese Army captors the day the U.S. dropped the A-bomb on Hiroshima. Leading to the debut of the Silver Samurai, over half a century later, as part of a convoluted attempt to make use of Logan's mutant healing factor-enhanced longevity. Now, in this speculative sequel to X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, we learn the possible outcome of Logan's alteration of history. It is 2029 (twelve years from now). And, instead of a dystopian future ruled by the robotic Sentinels, we have a future in which mutants are virtually on the edge of extinction because of a mysterious drop in the collective birth of them. Well that, and a strongly hinted-at disaster involving the School for Gifted Youngsters and Professor Xavier's telepathic manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease, Enter the high-tech mercenaries known as the Reavers and their leader, Donald Pierce. These guys are looking for a Mexican woman who ran off from a top-secret (and highly illegal) genetic research facility. One that's been using abducted Mexican women as surrogate mothers for what are basically test-tube mutant babies!With the one called 'Laura' (brilliantly played by newcomer Dafne Keen) being Logan's surrogate daughter.The rest of the movie is somewhat predictable. The mercenaries are working for one of those half-mad scientists who now find it more profitable to work for shady bio-tech corporations rather than trying to conquer the world. In this case, Transigen (a corporate front for Logan's old friends at Alkali Lake). Once again, they want to breed the ultimate living weapon. And it appears they have succeeded!The form that success takes is the biggest surprise in the whole film. Unfortunately, it's almost cancelled out by what happens to the Munson farming family (played by Eriq LaSalle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse). I really wish they had been spared! I know they were introduced in order to serve as an example, to Logan, that one can have more than one kind of family in one's life. Nor does it necessarily have to be a biological one. But, their getting massacred shortly afterward still struck me as counter-productive.That's one of the reasons why I deduct one star from the perfect ten I would otherwise like to give it. The other reason, of course, is that this film marks the swan song for Hugh Jackman's almost twenty year-long portrayal of Marvel Comics most popular mutant. The anti-heroic one who was always the best at what he did! I understand he wants to avoid being irreparably stereotyped, like Adam West was after the BATMAN series went off the air. Yet part of me still hopes that he might return to the role someday, once he's satisfied his search for versatility. A search that, I must confess, has ended quite happily for other movie stars who have undertaken it.**Remember Robert Deniro's precedent-setting portrayal of the comatose mental patient in AWAKENINGS?",9,1,5,3 March 2017
Big Fish," Mondo bizarro!
","If ever a film deserved that catch phrase, as a description, it is this one.  *Warning: one or two spoilers ahead (I think).*   Tim Burton has surpassed himself with this audiovisual gem.   The FX-laden sequences, dramatizing Ed Bloom's embellished anecdotes, rival the ones in 'Secondhand Lions.'   And, Albert Finney is brilliantly convincing as the elderly Ed. He's still a silver-tongued storyteller.  But, the silver is rapidly tarnishing due to his terminal illness.  Equally convincing is Billy Crudup as his estranged son, Will.  In the process of reconciling with Ed, before it's too late, he finds out the two of them have more similarities than differences.   Jessica Lange is just-plain great as the older-but-elegantly-beautiful Sandra.  And, I hope to see both Marie Cotillard and the Tai Twins in more American movies.  Theatrical releases, at that!  4.5 stars",Null,0,0,1 February 2004
The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger's swan song...and it hit all the right notes.
","Many critics and fans thought Jack Nicholson would flop as the Joker in the 1989 'Batman' movie. They were surprised to be proved wrong. Many critics and fans thought John Candy's last film, a Western-spoof called 'Wagons East,' would be hilarious. They were disappointed at being proved wrong.Many critics and fans prayed that THE DARK KNIGHT would prove to be worthy of Heath Ledger's considerable talents. Their prayers were answered.I have seen this movie twice, now. Partly, because of one theater's lousy sound system. But, mostly, because I just plain liked it.Ledger's Joker has a more Gothic-look than Nicholson's. More similar to Brandon Lee's version of the Crow. And, the maniacal laugh sounds like an angrier, edgier version of the one used by Mark Hamill for the 1990's cartoon version!Add to that, some truly frightening actions (I literally jumped in my seat when that hanged corpse came crashing against the window!), and you have a new kind of Joker. One you would have no trouble believing when he professes to being an agent of chaos. In fact, I would be willing to go one step further and call this Joker the personification of chaos!!!Because, as played by the late, great Heath Ledger, this Joker is waging a one-man war against order. Never mind the law!As for the rest of the cast? Maggie Gyllenhaal reminded me more of a brunette Kirsten Dunst, rather than Katie Holmes. But, she still put in a masterfully poignant performance as ADA Rachel Dawes. And, Aaron Eckhart, who I remember only from the romantic comedy 'No Reservations,' surprised me with the convincingness with which he played Harvey Dent.Tommy Lee Jones and Billy Dee Williams, eat your hearts out! As for Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman? Chances are good they'll be back for the next sequel. And, I can only hope that a slight quip made by Mr. Freeman--during the scene where Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne discuss the lighter-weight Batman costume--proves to be an accurate portent of who will be the next Bat-foe to appear opposite Mr. Bale.In summation, then (as Harvey Dent might've said): this movie is a fitting feather to posthumously put in Heath Ledger's proverbial cap. And, for that reason alone, you should all see this movie.",10,1,3,20 July 2008
Grindhouse," Much better than I initially expected!
","I grew up during the drive-in era, and this is almost exactly the way I remember those summertime double-features. 'Almost' meaning, the Skyvue Theater never had missing reels. And, the only scratchy parts were the intermission ads, which I'm sure were genuinely left over from the Fifties.Plus, back in the Seventies, films like PLANET TERROR and DEATHPROOF would have been considered A-features, compared to the rubber-suit monster movies put out by Toho Studios, at that same time!*And, now, to the movies, themselves.PLANET TERROR was pretty good. It had a half-way decent storyline, with a nice little dig at the Bush administration during Bruce Willis' explanation for the Sicko Syndrome. And, Rose McGowan was absolutely fabulous during the dance, in the opening credits!DEATHPROOF, however? A bit slow-paced. And, I was mystified by the presence of all those people, in that Austin bar. Particularly, Kurt Russell's first five victims! Were they supposed to be the cast of some B-movie, shooting on-location, only to be given a day off by the rain? If so, that's one 'reel' that should not have been 'missing,' at all (for explanatory purposes).Other than that, I enjoyed this homage, immensely. *Btw; I still regard the original Godzilla flicks as undeniably superior to the CGI revisions Toho has done, more recently.",9,1,6,14 April 2007
The Artist," I finally saw this, for the first time, earlier today.
","It was alright. But, worthy of the Best Picture Oscar for 2011-12? Uh-uh! No way!For one thing, there were less people in attendance, at the theater I saw this at, than there were at the debut of TEARS OF LOVE (the silent jungle flop personally financed by 'George Valentin' within the movie)! And, why did Malcolm McDowell waste his talents by doing a thirty-second cameo appearance? Who was he supposed to be; Charlie Chaplin? If so, that's an even bigger disservice to Chaplin, himself! The man was still a justly-revered figure in Hollywood, in 1927, and would _never_ have been relegated to appearing as an extra.Were it not for the obvious chemistry of the two French leads, I would have given this little period piece only one star. And, even then, I would classify this as an undeniable 'must _never_ see.'",5,2,7,18 March 2012
Super 8," Steven Spielberg has come full circle.
","And, he has done so, beautifully!The man who brought us E.T. and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND has shown us the flip side of what might happen to us if we _don't_ have a first contact where we prove just as amicably curious as the extra-terrestrial beings we someday hope will openly visit us.The CGI being, in this case, looks like a cross between Sebulba the Dug and the Cloverfield Monster. But, he/she/it is undeniably _way_ scarier than both! Fortunately, we (as in, all six billion of us) are saved from a fate worse than SKYLINE by the unbiased compassion and understanding of children supposedly too young-to-know-better.Elle Fanning (younger sister of Dakota 'THE TAKEN' Fanning) is convincingly tear-jerking as Alice Dearden. The tomboy daughter of the man that Joe Lamb's father (Kyle 'EARLY EDITION' Chandler) holds responsible for the industrial accident in which his wife (Joe's mother) was killed. And, as for Joel Courtney who plays young Joe, himself?He just plain out-Elliot's Henry Thomas.In short; if the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn't nominate this for Best Picture proper, at next year's Oscars? I'm switching channels!",10,3,7,10 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Not too shabby!
","*A few spoilers ahead.* The martial arts fight choreography looked plenty authentic to me.  And, so did the regret shown by Tom Cruise's character over a needless massacre of innocent Cheyenne women and children (a la Sand Creek, Colorado, circa 1864).   I also loved the way he gradually bonded with the family of the masked samurai he killed.  *Miss Koyuki might be giving Lucy Liu a run for her money, in future Asian/American co-productions.* I think the only complaint I have with this movie is the historical liberties taken with the Meiji Rebellion.  To my knowledge, that lasted less than a year...back in 1868!",Null,1,2,8 December 2003
Beauty and the Beast," Not bad! But, it's going to suffer by inevitable comparison to the 1991 original.
","Yes, I went to see it out of curiosity (like a lot of you, I suspect). But, while it adhered pretty closely to the Menken/Ashman masterpiece of twenty-six years ago, it still didn't recapture the charm and novelty of it. Not for me, anyway.Ewan McGregor, as Lumiere, is no Jerry Orbach. Emma Thompson, as Mrs. Potts, is no Angela Lansbury. Ian McKellen sounded more like Patrick Stewart (his co-star from the X-MEN films) rather than Charles Ogden Stiers (the voice of the original Cogswell). And Emma Stone? Well, her song coach should be proud of her. But, she's still no Catherine O'Hara.All in all, then, it was a nice way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon. But, I sincerely doubt this will be the Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards, the same way the original movie was.",5,0,2,25 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," One star better than THE CIRCLE. Not quite as good as GOTG Vol.1.
","Once more, we have a total retcon of characters I grew up with. Mantis--who, in the comics, was a highly intelligent, kick-butt martial artist raised by Shaolin-like Kree expatriates--is reduced to being an empathic bug-like concubine. Drax is still a knife- wielding psychopath rather than the J'onn J'onzz analog he was in the Silver Age Captain Mar-Vell stories. And the only nod to the original GOTG comic from the 1960's is the inclusion of Martinex (a crystalline humanoid) as first-mate to special guest-star Sylvester Stallone.The only thing remaining intact was the concept of Ego being an aptly-named living planet. Add to all that the fact that, once again, out-takes were unethically used as previews and you have a time-killing adventure flick that isn't too bad. Almost as delightfully campy as any old episode of the Adam West Bat-series, in fact! But, still possessed of way too much room for improvement.",6,2,5,11 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Whether or not you've read the book, ask yourself these two questions.
","Question #1: do you think the story's premise makes for a thrilling, suspenseful action-adventure? Question #2: do you think the story's premise has a greater-than-zero percent basis in actual fact?If you answered 'yes,' to the first one, and 'no,' to the second, then go see the movie with a clear conscience. Otherwise, stay home and wait for the DVD to come out in three months.As for me? All I saw was a good old-fashioned, edge-of-my-seat chase flick. With a religious angle no more blasphemous than the one used for, say, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Just grimmer and grittier, is all. Otherwise, the 2.5 hour-long running time seemed to literally fly by, for me! I found it that enjoyable.I think Tom Hanks did an excellent job, as Robert Langdon. I look forward to more American co-productions featuring Ms. Tautou. I haven't seen Jean Reno this double-dealing since the first MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie. And, I hope Ian McKellen gets a double-nomination, for next year's Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as both Sir Lee and Magneto! The one who played the Cardinal, though? I couldn't quite bring myself to love hating him, the same way I did his albinistic assassin. He reminded me too much of Richard Kind. The actor who used to play the cheerful, chubby guy on SPIN CITY.",10,4,7,25 May 2006
Mystic River," Ever hear of something called 'Once Upon A Time, In America?'
","*Almost spoiler-free.* It was the cinematic swan-song of Clint Eastwood's old mentor, Sergio Leone. Well, the modest ex-mayor of Carmel, California might disagree. But, I think 'Mystic River' outdoes OUATIA! Sean Penn's reaction (as Jimmy), to the discovery of his daughter's body, is the most powerful one I've seen since Daniel J. Travanti played John Walsh, in the TV-movie 'Adam.' Kevin Bacon is equally convincing as the cop torn between the letter-of-the-law and old childhood friendship. And, Tim Robbins will probably be competing, against Robert Duvall, for that Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Definitely 5 stars!",10,0,0,27 October 2003
The Departed," Someone once said that the only difference between cops and robbers is the badge.
","Well, in this movie, both the Good Guy and the Bad Guy have badges. Ben Affleck is the crooked cop, Colin Sullivan. He works for Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), an Irish-American gangster whom Sullivan has both feared and idolized since childhood. And, he apparently measures success by how close he can live to the ritzy neighborhood where the Old Boston Statehouse is located.Leo DiCaprio , on the other hand, plays Billy Costigan. An honest cop whose late father was apparently a nouveau riche gangster who married a Boston Brahmin debutant. And, so, he has spent most of his young life feeling like an outcast in both the blue-collar and green-collar parts of Beantown.Costigan is recruited to spy on Costello's mob, so that Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) can finally send his old rival to prison. While Sullivan, of course, is paid to keep that from happening! In a way, then, these two young men are just pawns in a real-life game of chess, where Queenan and Costello are the players.But, in a major piece of irony, the pawns _become_ the players after the deaths of both Queenan and Costello! And, caught between them is Madolyn, the psycho-analyst they both fall in love with.Just like in 'Taxi Driver,' Martin Scorsese proves that morality is not so much black-and-white as various shades of gray. And, it's very hard to tell the darker shades from the lighter ones. The only reason I don't give this a perfect ten? The violence and swearing get a little excessive. Even for an R-rated movie! But, I still recommend, most heartily, that you go see it.",9,0,2,13 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," Puts the 'fun' in 'dysfunctinal.'
","I have to admit: this movie literally tested my patience, during the first fifteen minutes. but, unlike the first quarter-hour of 'Finding Neverland,' I did NOT walk out of the movie theater. I stayed for the rest of 'Wedding Crashers.' And, I'm glad I did! Even when the rest of the audience wasn't laughing hysterically (which wasn't often), I did. This is the funniest Owen Wilson has been, for me, since those two Western-spoofs that he did with Jackie Chan! Vince Vaughn was hysterical, too. I confess that this is the first I've heard of him. There's no denying, though, that he has the most comedic fast-talk since John Moschitta did those Federal Express commercials. The actresses who play their love interests aren't half-bad, either. Rachel McAdams is suitably wholesome looking, as Claire. And, Isla Fisher (as 'Gloria') does for redheads what Reese Witherstone and Alicia Silverspoon did for blondes. Specifically; prove that ditziness is only skin-deep. Best of all, is the uncredited cameo by Will Farrell. He's ten times funnier, during the last 20 minutes of this movie, than he was throughout all of 'Bewitched!' *Way to go, Mr. F. And, Happy 38th birthday!* The only thing that prevented this movie from being a perfect ten was the Eleanor Roosevelt joke. But, that's just me.",9,1,6,16 July 2005
The Last King of Scotland," God! What a boring movie!
","I know this is based on actual events. And, I know that most of the people who loved this film will vote my review as 'useless.' But, that does not change the fact that I walked out of this movie, at the seventy-minute mark, because of its agonizing slowness!James McAvoy's portrayal of Dr. Nicholas Garrigan did not cause me to identify with his character, in any way. Not when his decision to visit Uganda, as a medical missionary, was prompted by NOT wanting to go into private practice with his father (or, apparently, suffer through a Canadian winter).As for Forrest Whitaker? He did a half-way decent job, in his portrayal of Idi Amin. Especially, in the depiction of the latter's gradual slide from the 'George Washington' to the 'Adolf Hitler' of Uganda. But, more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar than Will Smith? Nope! Uh-uh! No way! I repeat what I stated in the message boards.WILL SMITH WAS ROBBED!The only exciting parts, during those first seventy minutes, were the treatment of Mackenzie Amin's epilepsy; and the attempted assassination of Idi Amin during the test drive of Garrigan's new car. And, as far I'm concerned, those were two scenes too few.Do yourselves a favor, folks. Don't waste your money going to see this. Because, not even the versatile Mr. Whitaker can save this flick. And, I cite as irrefutable proof the fact that it did NOT win Best Picture!",4,3,10,11 March 2007
It Chapter Two," A three-hour sequel that proves longer running time plus a bigger budget does not always equal better.
","Where to begin?Perhaps with the needless prologue where a bunch of teenage Down Eastern rednecks beat up a gay couple in their thirties. Was that even in the original book? I don't think so. And if it was? I still regard it as unnecessary!Then, there was the constant F-bombing. Is Hollywood employing more script-writers with Taurette's Syndrome? Or were the writers of this particular screenplay just trying to hide the fact that half this movie was so boring, a lot of movie-goers where I went to see this (myself included) were literally starting to fall asleep!All I know for sure is, if I ran a restaurant where six customers were swearing that frequently and loudly, I would have told them to either shut up and get out, or I'd call the cops. Long before they started killing hallucinatory hobgoblins with expensive restaurant furniture!The most irrefutable proof that this sucked, however, is the fact that, when the end credits started rolling, absolutely nobody--repeat: NOBODY--clapped for the relatively happy ending.In short? Rent the original 2-part TV mini-series. You'll find it scarier for what you don't see than what you do.",2,6,13,8 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," I went to see this movie twice in a row. Just for the sneaky epilogue!
","As a rule, most movies rarely feel as good when you see them a second time. This film, however, is an exception to that rule. It's like the writers at Warner Brothers and Legendary decided: 'What if we did a sequel to the Jack Black/Naomi Watts remake set during the Vietnam War a la APOCALYPSE NOW?'Well, it looks like they did. And with the box office take, from Opening Weekend approaching the $73 million mark, I think it's safe to assume that the answer is a resounding 'Yes!'First off, there's the brilliantly subtle nod to Joseph Conrad, the author of the jungle adventure novel on which APOCALYPSE NOW was loosely based. That happens to be the surname of Tom Hiddleston's character; an ex-captain of the British Special Air Service burnt out from all his military service. Yet, he still resides in Southeast Asia, putting his military expertise to what he'd like to believe is good civilized humanitarian use. Hence, his first name 'Jack' (derived, I think, from 'Union Jack,' symbol of steadfast British resolve).Then, there's the relative newcomer Brie Larson playing Mason Weaver; a tomboyish photojournalist whose coverage of the Vietnam War, on the front lines, did not sway her pacifist beliefs against America's involvement in it, one bit. No moral U-turn for her (unlike, say, David Jansen's journalistic character in THE GREEN BERETS)! And that's why I think, even though I've never heard of her before, Ms. Larson is going to make as big a name for herself, in the near-future, the same way Sigourney Weaver did from 1978 onward.John C. Reilly, as Lt. Hank Marlow (a U.S. Army Air Forces fighter pilot, stranded on the island since 1944), provides both comedy relief and poignancy at the same time. I mean, one minute you can be laughing at his debate with Lt. Slivko, of the First Air Cavalry, about which music style is superior; Depression-era swing or 1960's rock-and-roll. The next moment, you're almost brought to tears by how much he was able to put aside his initial wartime hatred of fellow cast-away Gunpei Ikari (formerly of the Imperial Japanese Air Force) whom he tragically outlived on the island.But, Samuel L. Jackson practically steals the show as Colonel Preston Packard.* A decorated hero of the Vietnam War, who even got to shake hands with Lyndon B. Johnson, you get the sense that he probably got his start as a Tuskegee Airman during World War II. Hence, his bitterness about returning to the States from Saigon (remember: the film is set in 1973) without the same kind of clear-cut victory. That, in turn, is why he becomes Captain Ahab to King Kong's Moby Dick.Now, I've heard that this movie is going to do for Toho Studios' venerable monsters what Marvel Films did for the superheroes of the Avengers. Which is to say...bring them together. Hence, the sneaky epilogue!Combine that with the vintage music sound track (my favorites were the two Creedence Clearwater classics); and you have one sci-fi action/adventure flick that you just should not miss.*I can't help feeling that his character's name is an automotive pun on his Marvel Films character. As in, Col. Nick Fury being reminiscent of the Plymouth Fury which came out the same year the quality of Packard cars started going downhill (circa 1955)?",10,4,8,15 March 2017
Ray," I don't think this movie is superior to 'La Bamba' or 'The Buddy Holly Story.'
","But, it is certainly the most refreshingly honest bio-pic I've seen in a long time. In fact, it might be more accurate to call this 'brutally honest.' *Possible spoilers ahead.* I never knew that he had spent the first seven years of his life in northern Florida (rather than the 'Georgia' he was always singing about). Nor was I aware that he had been banned from performing in the latter state, until 1979. But, what I found most shocking of all was the revelation that he had been a heroin-addicted philanderer! Where was this kind of uncompromising honesty when Denzel Washington was portraying Reuben 'Hurricane' Carter? That film took all kinds of liberties with the truth, in order to make it seem like the real-life Carter had been framed for a crime he never committed. *A train of thought that has long since been derailed, I believe.*Jamie Foxx, however, shows the world--and lily-white me, most of all--that Raymond Charles Robinson, Senior was just as human as anyone else. He had flaws that counter-balanced his indisputable musical genius. And, for showing such integrity, I think it will be an unpardonable crime if Mr. Foxx does not get the Best Actor Oscar come the spring of 2005!",Null,1,3,3 November 2004
Music and Lyrics," Passable old-fashioned romantic comedy.
","I'll confess that the only reason I saw this movie, at all, was due to an early matinée showing of 'Zodiac' being already sold out. But, once I got into the story, it was surprisingly pretty good!Not knee-slapping hysterical, mind you. In fact, a lot of the intended jokes made cringe rather than laugh. But, I loved the faux-Eighties music video that opened and closed the story. In many ways, I still think the genuine articles were more entertaining than some of the current stuff aired on MTV, nowadays!And, it's almost impossible to dislike Drew Barrymore's performance as a hypochondriac plant-sitter whose talent for poetry is matched only by her unrequited crush for her snobbish ex-college professor/boyfriend.Brad Garrett is also pretty funny as Hugh Grant's DJ/manager. Haley Bennett satirizes Generation-X divas with twice as much accuracy as Pink. And, Grant himself all-but steals the show as a heterosexual version of George Michael trying to make a come-back.All told, I liked it a lot better than I initially thought I would.",7,1,2,5 March 2007
Wonder Woman," A two-and-a-half hour thrill ride that delivers what it promises...and 'so much more.'
","Those aren't sarcastic quote marks, either! This movie basically serves as a prequel to BATMAN V. SUPERMAN in that it explains the strange WWI-era photograph Bruce Wayne found in the latter film. Which is a good thing. Because, as most of us fanboys over age thirty know, the comic book Wonder Woman started out as a super-heroine fighting against the Axis Powers of World War II! But, as the late, great Peter O'Toole pointed out (in that 1980 cult classic THE STUNT MAN), World War I is one of the most romanticized conflicts in military history. If only because it demonstrated to those born and raised in the Victorian era that war is _not_ romantic! Especially for those caught in the crossfire (literally and otherwise). It was in WWI that tanks, war planes, and fully automatic machine guns were first invented. So, naturally, there would never again be anymore marching into battle with fifers and drummers leading the way.Diana of Themiscyra (having been raised on a well-nicknamed Paradise Island) is the perfect personification of all that culture shock. And Gal Gadot, having been born and raised in often-war-torn Israel, is able to give us (the viewing audience) a very convincing simulation of that shock. Even with the slightly jaded Steve Trevor as her tour guide! That brings us to Chris Pine. The U.S. Army didn't officially enter WWI till 1916, at the earliest. But, quite a few individuals didn't want to wait that long. So, they either joined the famed Lafayette Escadrille via the French Foreign Legion. Or they joined the British army as horse-drawn ambulance drivers. As Pine's version of Trevor is working for British Military Intelligence, I venture to think he was recruited into the latter via their French counterparts (Le Deauxieme Bureau). If so, I have to commend him for whatever boning up he did on the historical background of WWI. Turkey was, indeed, a German ally during that war. That, in turn, makes Steve Trevor's presence in the Mediterranean even more plausible. As he would no doubt have been trying to get to the British naval base on Malta in that stolen monoplane!I also have to give kudos to the characters of Samir, Charlie, and the Chief. Original characters they might be (with undertones of a politically incorrect joke about three guys walking into a bar). But, they still lend a very nice mixed bag of poignancy and comic relief to this film.As for David Thewlis? Well, let's just say (for those who haven't see the movie, already) that Sir Patrick Morgan is _not_ Bruce Wayne's great-great-grandfather.",10,13,31,3 June 2017
Despicable Me," I went to see this with some pretty negative preconceptions
","But, I was wrong!!!This movie was way funnier than I expected. From the post-opening scene where Gru demonstrates his 'villainy' by popping some little boy's balloon animal (after making it for him!). To the semi-predictable-yet-no-less-happy ending.Of course, it's Gru's loyal Minions who provide the most laughs. Not only with their physical appearance (sort of a mutant cross between a potato and a banana). But, also with their clumsiness...and a set of falsetto voices that make them sound like they've been snorting helium!I'm not a parent, myself. But, if some of you reading this are, and some of your older kids think they're too big for TOY STORY 3? Then, take them to see this movie. It'll be more fun than a barrel of Tom Hanks' monkeys!",10,4,7,11 July 2010
X-Men: First Class," It completely contradicts the last two movies.
","Which is the only reason I don't give this a perfect ten. MacAvoy and Fassbender are superb as early day versions of Charles Xavier and Erik Magnus Lensherr. And, even the transposition of Darwin and Tempest from their early 21st century comic book appearances, to the Cuban Missile Crisis, I can deal with.But, what I cannot abide is needless rebooting with no regard for the memory of the older movie-goers, or credit for their intelligence.Emma Frost was ten years younger in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (which was set mostly in the 1970's) than January Jones' portrayal, here. Of course, fan boys like me can easily ret-con that by saying: 'Oh! Maybe the one in ORIGINS is this one's namesake niece. Maybe even her daughter! After all, Silver Fox did call her 'my sister.' Which could imply some kind of adoptive sibling relationship.'But, not so easy to ignore is the fact that this prequel depicts Xavier being accidentally crippled by Moira McTaggart. Whereas, in the flashback prologue of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (set circa the 1980's), he was seen as perfectly ambulatory. _Walking_ into the Grey family's residence, to meet adolescent Jean, side-by-side with Lensherr! How are you going to explain that one away, Fox and Marvel? A bitter, time-traveling Romulan from the 24th Century? I don't think so.In short; the movie wasn't bad. But, in this case? 'Not bad' is just not good enough.",5,3,7,4 June 2011
Black Panther," Excellent lead-in to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR.
","The story is straightforward enough. The prologue is set in 1992, where a much younger King T'Chaka visits one of his War Dogs (Wakandans who are supposed to impartially spy on the Outside World) who turns out to be his younger brother Prince N'Jobu! Charges of treason are leveled against the prince, following which......the movie fast-forwards 24 years.That's right. The bulk of the movie is set one week after the ending of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. And the bulk of the script has been brilliantly adapted from the debut story arc in Marvel Comics' 'Jungle Action.' A magazine of the 1970's that helped revive reader interest in Prince T'Challa after his departure from the Silver Age comic book Avengers, ten years earlier. And which first introduced then-teenagers like me to such memorable characters as Erik Killmonger; M'Baku the Man-Ape; and Monica Lynn.Sadly, the latter has been replaced by another, more geographically convenient love interest; the Lady Nakia. But, the other two are still around and refreshingly updated for the 2010's. M'Baku, in particular! In the comics, his tribe/clan worshipped white gorillas (as part of a cult outlawed by the more dominant Panther Clan). Yet, in this movie, they worship a West African avatar of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god).* While Erik Killmonger goes from being a common mercenary to someone with an initially mysterious grudge against T'Challa. Hence, the former's eventual double-cross of Ulysses Klaw (who, btw, goes from East European mad scientist-changed-into-creature-of-living sound, in the comic books, to expatriate South African cyborg in the film).* I don't want to give away too much of the rest of the story. Suffice it to say that Chadwick Boseman gave just as convincing a performance as T'Challa as he did in CA:CW. Thereby making the two hour-and-then-some running time fly by relatively fast. Including the now-customary sneaky epilogues during the ending credits! One strange thing, though. Based on all the advance person-on-the-street interviews I saw on the six o'clock news, this movie was hailed as a revolutionary (and long overdue) first step in bringing an African-American superhero to the silver screen. So, why was most of the audience who went to see this at my hometown multiplex...of the Caucasian persuasion?Ah, well!**Don't ask. Just enjoy.",9,2,7,17 February 2018
Casino Royale," I was slightly disappointed.
","Yes: Daniel Craig combines the ruthless efficiency of Sean Connery with some of the (under-rated) pathos exhibited by Timothy Dalton. And, yes: for only the third time in the series, the high-tech genius called Q is absent. But, a credit to the Bond flicks that have gone before it? With regard to continuity, I'd have to say: undeniably no!First of all; this is supposed to be a prequel, explaining how Bond became a double-oh agent, in the first place. So, why wasn't this set at the tail end of the Cold War, instead of the present day? Secondly; Bond, himself, admits (in 'Dr. No'), that he had never met Felix Leiter, up to that point. He had only heard of him. So, why throw all that out the window? Why couldn't the writers have made Jeffrey Wright's character a CIA operative _working_ for Felix? Last, but not least? Judi Dench's character is only supposed to have been promoted to M, just a short time BEFORE the theft of that high-tech chopper in 'Goldeneye.' So, if ret-conning now places that in the near-future, shouldn't Dench have been nothing more than a female Chief of Staff, filling in for an absent male M? After all; that's how they did it in 'For Your Eyes Only,' following the real-world death of Bernard Lee (Connery's M)!So, I'm sorry, folks. But, there's only so much revisionism my suspension-of-disbelief can stand. The same kind of revisionism killed the film-series based on Tom Clancy's 'Jack Ryan' novels. And, may yet do the same to even 007.",5,17,30,18 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I just got back from seeing this, tonight (12/19/15).
","And the Force is still strong with this franchise!I suspect that what most people really found wrong with the Prequel Trilogy is that it had an unhappy ending. But, knowing that the latter was necessary as a prelude to the Original Trilogy, they blamed their dislike (unfairly, in my permanent opinion) on other factors.Well, I'm just as fairly certain that those complainants will have no reason (or excuse) to dislike the Third Trilogy. For one thing? The heroes of the Original Trilogy are back! Luke Skywalker; Han Solo; Leia; Chewbacca; C3PO; even R2D2. Of course, Disney wisely has their reappearances spread apart, at different intervals. Saving the most dramatic one, for last (though, definitely not least).Instead, we are given two new heroes to cheer for: Rey (a techno- scavenger on the desert planet Jakku); and FN-1287 aka 'Finn' (a stormtrooper-turned-deserter with the proverbial heart of gold). Followed by a proportionately hiss-able villain who calls himself 'Kybo Ren.' Of course, it soon becomes obvious to the movie-going audience just who and what he really is! A fact that comes as a pleasant surprise to fans (like me) of what used to be known as the Expanded Universe. Because, it dovetails, quite well, with certain elements of the literary New Jedi Order Era even while ret-conning a whole lot of others.All in all, then, I enjoyed this film so much, I will probably go see it a second time. I can only hope that Episodes Eight and Nine were filmed simultaneously for semi-annual release (the 'LOTR Method') as opposed to the three-year cycles of the first two trilogies.",10,3,29,19 December 2015
Final Destination," VLADIMIR LEVENTON WOULD'VE BEEN PROUD!
","He's the Russian-born producer/director who changed his name to 'Val Lewton.'  His first claim to fame was the original 1942 version of 'the Cat People.'  His second claim to fame was his often-paraphrased belief about what scares people more.  He felt it was the stuff they DON'T see!  And, this movie lives up to that philosophy.  Why, even the lead actress'character is named 'Valerie Lewton!'  Plus, there was enough box-office success that a not-too-bad sequel resulted.  *Does that revelation count as a spoiler?*   Final analysis? If a few more horror-flick producers and directors followed that philosophy, they wouldn't have mega-flops like the Liam Neeson remake of 'The Haunting' coming back to haunt their resumes'!  Personal rating? 3.9 stars",Null,0,1,6 June 2003
Deadpool," Sort of a cross between CATWOMAN and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.
","By that, I mean that the plot (mad scientist moonlighting as merchant of death ultimately kidnaps Catherine Bell look-alike doubling as love interest of anti-hero) exists only as a means of thinly justifying all the action sequences. On the other hand, the Thornton Wilder-style breakings of the Fourth Wall do allow Ryan Reynolds to take some well- deserved pot shots at Time-Warner with regard to GREEN LANTERN. Furthermore, the almost-touching scene where Wade walks out on Vanessa, in order to take advantage of Ajax's 'cancer cure treatment,' leads to a bit of scenery-chewing by the British guy playing the latter that--quite frankly--almost literally put me to sleep!That being said, however, I still enjoyed this film a lot more than the prequel I shall always (without hesitation...or apology) refer to as X- MEN: LOW CLASS. Especially the debut of Negasonic Teenage Warhead!I'm hoping she's a revamped version of Boom-Boom from the comics.",7,2,12,13 February 2016
Fantastic Four," How much did I like this? Let me count the ways!
","1) The updating of how they get their super-powers. In the comics, it was a side-effect of the Cold War's 'race into space.' But, the Cold War ended fifteen years ago! So, instead, the audience witnesses the fateful cosmic storm hitting a corporate version of the International Space Station. 2) The updating of Sue Storm's personality. Instead of being Reed Richard's blindly loyal piece of arm candy (as she seemed to be in the 1960's), she is a modern woman who has just as many smarts as him. But, far more capable of showing her emotions, when the situation calls for more than intellect. 3) The faithful rendering of Johnny and Ben's clashing personalities. The former is almost incessantly insensitive and 'show-offy,' especially after becoming the Human Torch. And, the latter's heartbreak at being rejected by his fiancé'--while everyone else is applauding him for saving that firetruck--was so convincing, everyone in the audience who saw this with me gave a collective 'Awww!' *If Michael Chiklis isn't one of the nominees for Best Supporting Actor, at next year's Oscars, I'm changing channels.* 4) Last, but not least? Julian McMahon outdoes the great job he did as 'Cole' on CHARMED. Where that character could arouse sympathy in 49% of the show's viewership, as Victor Von Doom, he arouses _none_! You love to hate him, and don't feel guilty about doing so. I think this is partially due to portraying him as a ruthless techno-businessman. Something that was done, quite successfully, to the post-1985 Lex Luthor at Marvel Comics' Distinguished Competition. *A direct lift-cum-homage, perhaps?* My only complaint is the way Dr. Doom was given his armored look. Instead of it being a robotic exo-skeleton, it's depicted as more of a mutation. One that makes him resemble a sort of Colossus/Magneto hybrid! So, that's why I only award this movie eight-out-of-ten points. It's not perfect. But, it's definitely FAN-DIRTY-WORD-TASTIC!",8,11,20,8 July 2005
The Great Escape," The Shakespeare of P.O.W. escape movies!
","*May contain spoilers.* Contrary to popular disbelief, this is just as much a WWII movie as 'Saving Private Ryan.' It's simply that much of its action takes place AWAY from the front lines, the same as 'Schindler's List.' And, I don't hear anyone calling THAT a non-WWII movie! Plus, a lot of the cast were portraying composite characters (semi-fictionalized amalgams of some of the actual escapees). Fans of the original 'Jurassic Park' will learn that Richard Attenborough could (and still can) portray more than just lovably eccentric-but-misguided millionaire grandfathers. And, Charles Bronson and James Coburn (both sadly gone, now) practically steal all the scenes that Steve McQueen isn't in! So, my final analysis is now, and forever more,...TEN STARS!",10,1,3,22 September 2003
John Wick: Chapter 2," Apparently, they're planning to develop a full-fledged trilogy.
","I don't know if they'll succeed, though. I mean, I went to see this on a Saturday afternoon during Opening Weekend...and there were only about a dozen people there (myself, included)! Disconcerting? Yes. A guarantor of box office failure? Not necessarily.I, for one, liked the way it expanded on John Wick's backstory. In the first movie, Nico Tarasov describes to his know-nothing son how John was given a seemingly impossible task to perform in exchange for being allowed to retire and marry his beloved Helen. We now learn, in this sequel, that John successfully accomplished it only because of unspecified help provided by Santino D'Antonio of the Camorra (a real- life Neapolitan version of the more infamous Mafia). Having learned of John's one-man vendetta against the Tarasovs, Santino uses that opportunity to collect on that debt...in the form of his own sister's assassination. And thus begins a series of ever-escalating fights and shoot-outs. Not only with Gianna D'Antonio's vengeance- seeking bodyguard, Cassian. But, also, the henchmen of the double- crossing Santino...led by a seemingly mute lesbian tomboy. Needless to say, Santino ultimately pays for his treachery. But, it comes at a tremendous price for John. Namely; permanent disownment by the CEO of the Continental Hotel chain (which provides neutral ground lodging for all globe-trotting hit men and women). Now, personally, I think John did Sir Winston a favor. I mean, if Santino was willing to stoop to having his own sister killed, just to become king of all organized crime in New York City, would he really have stopped there? I don't think so. An ambitious narcissist, like him, would eventually have strove to become the only one sitting at the High Table. Perhaps, even new and sole owner of the Continental Hotel chain! And I think Sir Winston realized that, too. Why else give John one hour's grace with regard to the internationalizing of the open contract put out on his life by Santino? At any rate, this cliff-hanger ending sets up the expectation that there will be a third and final chapter. One that will hopefully further expand on the now twice-mentioned 'impossible task.' For example: did it involve the death of Santino and Gianna's father? If so, do either of them have any offspring of their own (legit or otherwise) looking to avenge their deaths at John Wick's expense? Most importantly of all; will John get his beloved Mach 1 Mustang back?Until that third question is answered 'yes,' I only give this nine out of ten stars.",9,3,8,19 February 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Raimi + Craven + Carpenter = WHEDON!
","Watch any re-run of the original EVIL DEAD film, and you'll get the Raimi reference. Watch any re-run of the SCREAM trilogy, and you'll get the Craven reference. Watch any re-run of IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, and you'll get the Carpenter reference.Combine all three with the fourth season of BTVS THE SERIES? And, you get a return to the brilliance that was Joss Whedon...prior to 'Once More With Feeling.'The Lovecraftian demon ballerina was an especially new (yet suitably gross) innovation. But, the creature playing with the puzzle ball? It looked like the Frankenstein Monster had a love-child by a female Cenobyte! And, while I didn't jump in my seat every fifteen minutes, like I did during Hammer's THE WOMAN IN BLACK, I still enjoyed this film. And, so will the rest of Mr. W's fans. As Alfred Pennyworth might say: 'Welcome home, sir. And, good show!'",9,6,21,14 April 2012
Spectre," Not bad! Although, the franchise might be starting to run out of steam.
","Don't get me wrong! This was a lot better than 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace.' But, it wasn't nearly as riveting as 'Skyfall.' Perhaps, because Judi Dench only had an uncredited cameo via DVD (and, even then, only for about ten seconds). Or, maybe because it was even grimmer than 'Skyfall,' what with myself, and a very small handful of other audience members, being the only ones to laugh at most of the equally small number of intended jokes. It could also be that most of the (otherwise exciting) action scenes and stunts have been recycled from other 007 movies. Or even that--with the exception of Daniel Craig, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, and Monica Belluci--most of the international cast might be totally unfamiliar to American audiences!In any case: while the tail end of the ending credits reassured everyone else that 'James Bond will return,' I'm not so sure. Given the full circle/emotional closure-type of happy ending they appeared to give this version of 007.",9,20,42,7 November 2015
The Nice Guys," Just got back from seeing a sneak preview, And, though I hate to admit it...
","...we've got a winner!And, for many reasons! For starters, there's the period music. Most of it, the way too-often unjustly maligned disco. My favorites were the classic songs from Earth, Wind, & Fire and Kool and the Gang.Then, there's the re-teaming of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. Their first appearance together since L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (which I'm positive she makes a thinly-disguised reference to when she first meets Crowe's 'Mr. Healey').There's also the chemistry between the three protagonists. Crowe, as a professional strong-arm man for hire. Sort of like Liev Schreiber's character from that Showtime series (only way more interesting). Ryan Gosling as Holland March; a bumbling-but-gold-hearted private eye trying to drown his survivors' guilt following the loss of his wife. And young Ms. Angourie Rice as Holland's long-suffering (though not always in silence) daughter Holly, who's twice as mentally sharp as--and ten times more emotionally mature than--her father!Throw in some nice physical comedy relief (like Gosling's hilarious imitation of Lou Costello at discovering a body in some bushes after an incredible fall down a wooded hill). Plus some witty banter supplied by co-writer and director Shane Black (most famous as the ill-fated 'Hawkins' in the original PREDATOR). Not to mention some good old- fashioned corporate crime and corruption typical of the post-Watergate Seventies. And you have the funniest action-comedy thriller I've seen since the original LETHAL WEAPON!Ryan and Russell rule.",10,8,19,19 May 2016
Me Before You," Anybody who can sit through this with completely dry eyes has a snowball for a heart.
","I initially went to see this in order to kill time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. And, also. because even the world's oldest comic book fanboy can get overloaded on superhero movies. But, to my surprise, I actually found myself liking this!For starters, it has a male lead who's actually a complete unknown to me! Sam Claflin, as Will Trainor. A 21st century aristocrat with an MBA who becomes quadriplegically paralyzed in a traffic accident. His gradual transition from self-pitying fatalist to relatively cheerful Charlie, over a period of six months, is due mostly to Louisa Clark.Lou, as she's known to family and friends, is played by Emilia Clarke. Picture the looks of a pre-WITCHBLADE Yancey Butler with the emotional range of Moira Kelly (from THE CUTTING EDGE) and the lovely accent of Rachel Weisz (from CHAIN REACTION and the first two MUMMY flicks). But, with the fashion sense of Reese Witherspoon's character during the first ninety minutes of LEGALLY BlONDE! It's this arsenal of qualities that brings Will out of his morbid funk. Even if only temporarily. I refuse to spoil the rest for you. Suffice it to say; any guy wishing to impress his girlfriend, with how sensitive he is, will succeed beyond all expectation if you take her to see this film! Fair warning, though. If you make the mistake of not bringing a whole box of Kleenex, then you'd better bring at least two of those (otherwise useless) boutique cubes of them. Because you'll definitely need them!",10,8,17,5 June 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Everything SKYLINE could've been (but, sadly, wasn't).
","As I've said elsewhere, I go to science fiction movies for pure escapism. Up to and including the stereotypical happy ending. And, TRANSFORMERS 3D: DARK OF THE MOON delivers. Interweaving conspiracy theory elements with the still on-going (seemingly endless) war between the Autobots and the Decepticons in an enjoyably plausible way.I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy as the voice of Sentinel Prime. Because, only those over age 39 (like myself) will remember and appreciate that he was the voice of Galvatron in the 1980's animated feature about the Transformers from Sunbow/Marvel!The one and only nitpick I have with the movie is the climax. I felt it was a tad overly-long and drawn out. Including where it intersected with Sam Witwitcky's (Shia LeBoeuf) relationship with Carly (his new, veddy British, yet admittedly hot) girlfriend.Hence, my deduction of two points.",8,1,5,2 July 2011
Valkyrie," Don't believe the so-called 'professional' critics who bad-mouthed it.
","I just got back from seeing this at an out-of-town movie theater. And, it was fantastic! I knew from high school that there had been a failed attempt, by members of his own High Command, to kill Hitler with a time bomb. But, that it was the last of FIFTEEN attempts?Incredible!Tom Cruise does a surprisingly good job at portraying Colonel Von Stauffenberg, a veteran of the German Army's North African campaign, whose battlefield injuries clinch his determination to end Hitler's life. Hence, his recruitment by a cadre of like-minded German generals and civilian politicians.The behind-the-scenes intrigue at arranging a coup d'etat, that mustn't look like a coup d'etat, literally kept me on the edge of my seat. And, the scenes dramatizing the private lives of the Von Stauffenberg family, as a whole, were suitably poignant.What really kept me emotionally involved, however, was the way some of the characters (like Gen. Albrecht) kept making me feel disgusted at their inaction, following the near-miss at Hitler's emergency headquarters, code-named 'the Wolf's Lair.' All this ranting and raving about the old sociopath having to go. And, yet, at the last minute, they're still afraid to fully commit themselves because they're worried about how to save their _own_ butts if something goes wrong???Psychiatrists call that 'self-fulfilling prophecy.' I call it cowardly hypocrisy. And, that I had this feeling, at all, is a sign of extra-good acting on the part of the people portraying these real- life figures.I don't know if 'Valkyrie' will win the Best Picture Oscar, this spring. But, I will be very disappointed if it's not one of the five nominees for it!",10,21,36,28 December 2008
Alien: Covenant," Just got back from Opening Night. Pretty good attendance! About 26 people.
","True! Not exactly a packed house. But still a lot better than the attendance for SMURFS: TLV and the golden anniversary re-release of THE GRADUATE put together. At least, where my hometown multiplex is concerned.So, how to summarize the story without total spoilage.Well, let's just say it takes place in the early 22nd century. That it quickly becomes a cross between PROMETHEUS and PASSENGERS. That we get to see a short prologue with Michael Fassbender and Guy Pearce reprising their roles as David the Android and Peter Weyland, respectively. And that we also get to see the Engineers' home world (or,at the very least, one of their major colonies)!I just wish their had been a few more recognizable names in the cast. Well, more recognizable to me, anyway. For example, Katherine Waterston- -who plays Danni Branson, widow of the S. S. Covenant's captain--I initially mistook for Jennifer Lawrence, co-star of PASSENGERS! So, it's kind of a mixed blessing when I say that she did _not_ remind me of Ellen Ripley, in any way/shape/form.There are also a few nods to ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But frankly, I think they hinder more than help. Especially, the over-reliance on classical music! So, while it's an entertaining time-killer, in general, I still can't shake the feeling that this particular film franchise might be running out of steam.",7,5,13,19 May 2017
