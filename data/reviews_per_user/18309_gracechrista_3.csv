Your Name.," The Anime of all Animes
","Seriously, if you are interested in Anime but have never given it a try, this is THE one to go to first.
I have re-watched this countless times, and it still blows my mind. There are multiple plot twists to get through, and it is a slice-of-life, heartwarming, story of life and the things that separate us and bring us together with a supernatural twist. As a hopeless romantic, I can't help but have a full heart after watching this, and crying a little bit. There is nothing about this that doesn't go above and beyond. If anything, I wish they would make a sequel.",10,1,2,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Sigh, This is a DISAPPOINTMENT
","Let me try to do this, spoiler free.
Star Wars always has the potential to be something great, and the reason I was a fan of the remakes was because they kept teasing at something great happening. I was looking for a solid ending, a moral, something for me to feel satisfied with. What I got was predictable, a remake of the ending of the originals, and heartbreaking---unnecessarily heartbreaking. I kept thinking 'this is when it's all gonna start making sense' it never did. There was no plan, no reasoning, no moral to take away from all of it. If anything, it was separated from human reality. They had so many opportunities but they fell flat time and time again. Marvel does a better job at storytelling than this. What a shame. That ending, the characters deserved better, I feel empty inside.",7,1,5,28 December 2019
Parasite," Any Explanation Would Be a Spoiler--That's How Good This Is
","This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane. There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. This--THIS is a TRUE thriller. Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on the condition of humanity.",10,27,44,28 December 2019
