Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining Movie, Could Not Stop Smiling..
","What a great movie, kept me entertained. It was a smart, clever, action-packed, suspenseful film with unpredictable twists. Typical of critics to give it low reviews, my advice to them, go back to your boring, crying, dramatic, senseless movies i.e. Young Adult and leave these movies to us.As a Film major it surprises me how many good films are badly reviewed. Just because the story doesn't have someone crying intensely or it's not really realistic they give it a bad review. If I remember correctly, movies are made to 'entertain' people, not bore them to death. Last week, we went to see Young Adult and I swear it was probably the grayest most mind numbing movie I've seen this year.What critics should start listening to is the audiences. Because without us, they would be out of a job. Funny how most critically acclaimed movies do so bad in the box office and the low reviewed ones do so well. Might want to start paying attention to those numbers.",9,4,8,22 December 2011
