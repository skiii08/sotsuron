Moneyball," Should not have been made.
","The movie, like so many other things in this world, is about how being in the right place at the right time, if you are lucky and more importantly if someone likes you, well, then you can rise and make gobs and gobs of money being a mediocre entity. In this case, a player that was at the pro level because he is liked and probably, there because the team's were short handed and/or desperate.
So fast forward, this guy is a minority owner and executive for being a double A level, if that, athlete, and in baseball in the 80s, so he was much of an athlete and they make a movie about him and now, this 'former player' is doing as well if not better than all the star athletes when he played and he was a double A player. Unbelievable.
No championship, ever and again (and this is why the world loves and hates this country) a person, not even at the mid level of playing or managing, but at the low , low levels and should not even have been in the majors makes GREAT.
Again we reward mediocrity and the funny thing is he was below 'mediocrity' and still sits pretty.
 You got guys like Scotty Bowman and Mario Lemieux and others in all sports at the top, top 2 percent ever, and don't even get a mention much less a movie about them
I get so tired of guys like this, doing nothing for society, and they get all the praise.
So tired of it.
The movie is ok.
Thanks for reading.?

P.S. And since he was GM till this movie, how many championship wins the Yankees have and how many championships , four, and if you count 1996, five. And the red Sox have how many, two, from 1996 till 2010 or 2011 (this movie) and how many championships did the A's get, oh NONE.
STOP REWARDING MEDIOCRITY, PLEASE.
This movie, about him, should not have been made!!!",3,1,5,23 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Rotten To The Core
","When I was a kid a used to read, and I still have those comic books, Spider-Man a lot.
Now I am a man, for some time now, and looking at a high school sophomore fight, for all intents and purposes, real harden criminals is just to far fetched for me, even if he was bitten by a spider. He has enhanced senses not enhanced heart. When your a kid this is a plausible idea, but as a man it is not.
Spiders can be killed also. When you have kids and women (and both weigh no more than 130 pounds, give or take) doing the exact same thing as, or against, people that are 250 pounds of better (in the case of villians) is just becomes a joke and insults our intelligence.
Moreover, it diminishes what their male counterparts (who are significantly larger, stronger, quicker and faster) are doing. Oh yeah, at the end spidey is walking with Stark and Downey is at least 4 or 5 inches taller and Downey is all of 5' 6' maybe and a BIG MAYBE, 5 ' 7'. Maybe camera angle but really, even smaller spiders were crushed. But I digress.
The role of superhero is that of anyone nowadays, and from the looks of it ANYONE is taking over.
Watch the end of (very, very close to the end) of 'Bowfinger' with Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy . They are karate guys but they are old and slow and have, well, problems physically, but they beat the crap out of hundreds of Ninjas. It looks funny, but you get the point.
At least the other 'superheroes' are adult males. Again , there is no way a high school sophomore is doing what he did even if he was bitten by a spider, just not happening.
The movie has him, at the end, all of a sudden attached to the bad guy flying to the plane and on the plane, not in the plane, his spidey web works outside, again not happening.
If it wasn't for my kids i would never watch these movies.
Again, as an adult I have a really hard time watching a 14 or 15 kid become violent and tough and take down numerous super villians.
So if you do not have kids, be an adult and see an adult picture or watch one from the 1930s of 1940s with meaning and not let these people get ultra rich doing a mediocre job, which is all the height they can attain and this movie proves it.

Wanted," John Wayne, They are Not, Read the bottom part.
","Curving bullets (obviously never shot a real gun with real bullets), heard of physics, being put in a tank that heals you faster (But they don't tell others so they can heal), women with arms the size of skewers (And they beat people. Those blows would do no damage to a person with their adrenaline pumped, think sports and her punch stopping a hockey player or football player going straight through you), loom orders, diversity for diversity sake and numerous other things that these 21 century, and late 20th century, movies have become.
This movie and the people in it are awful and are terrible actors, but as per usual, they force the people on you and because you haven't seen the true great, well trained actors, you accept them as good and they are not, accept for maybe Terrence Stamp
You always hear about reality in these movies, but they have become so unrealistic it insults your intelligence.
And if these people, which they are not, thank God, are protecting us, I will take care of myself. 
Lastly, assassins rarely use guns and never, never put civilians in harm's way, well, very, very rarely. They look like the population of their target and may be fat, bald, old, young, all kinds of shapes and sizes.
I will take the old days with John Wayne and his boys and they were real and family men and life and the traditions of America came first. Don't want to believe it, John Wayne captured the KGB AGENTS that were sent to assassinate him and and turned them to Americans from communists. LOOK AT THIS>>>>>>> Military.com How John Wayne Got Rid of the KGB AGENTS Hired to Kill Him.
Read this about real men and forget about Morgan Freeman with two earrings and the rest. If we had these guys back when there would be no America, that's why these men and the men before them were in charge, UNDERSTAND. So when reviewing here don't knock a President and Capitalise God
The real men out there now are not, I repeat, not on the movie screen yelling and screaming.
Tell me about the article!!!
Thanks for reading.
God Bless.

Alien vs. Predator," Always Will Make Money
","Read reviews. What the director does do, and to some extent he said so himself, just make money. He explores scripts, movies or franchise movies if you will, that were already successful or at least in the public consciousness. These movies he does, and this one AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004), all will make money just on their merits alone. Just like if I was to make a King Kong vs Gozilla movie. I would bet you the bank that I would turn a profit. 
By picking an established 'character' it then becomes how can I make 10 to 15 minutes of suspenseful scenes, albeit not Hitchcockian, and maybe 6 or 7 minutes of action (fighting between the Alien and Predator), so as not to raise the budget to high where the profit will be reduced. And, as in all of his films, almost all has achieved success. He makes movies, his words (and I am paraphrasing), that are not for the critics, this websites reviewers, but to make the majority of the audience happy, thus, having a profit and allowing future investors to allow him to direct because he is a 'profitable' director, albeit with already proven ' stars' or 'monsters' or a universe set up. The directors highest rating for a movie, on rotten tomatoes, I think was 41%. Most of all the other movies were in the 20 to 33% range, yet some of them turned a profit, case and point. When you make movies that appeal to the lowest common denominator intellectually, well, it does a disservice to those with an intellect. But, as usual it's not about making a great, new, provocative movie, it is about (this director at least) making money. Now that's okay but you are making money, as I said before, on an already established 'franchise.' Too be a really great film maker one has to explore their own interior and make that movie or movies that have no previous formula, but only your own creativity. From idea to script to pre-production and so on and so on till the movie, your 'baby', is completed. Then and only then will you truly be called a film maker.
Until then, money aside, you are part of the assembly line and not the stand alone artist.
Further, the people calling the 'monsters' classic are way off base. When this movie , AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004) was made it was only 17 years removed from the first one and the creators didn't, at least I my opinion, think is was going to be anything more than one movie, much less a 'universe.' You need at least 25 years, in cars at least, and certain states at that, for something to be a classic.
So simmer with the classic thing.
Also, again the director knew what he had and that's why she ('The main character ') can stand around in the Antarctica without a hat or a coat and have a 118 pound woman survive where (in the original Predator) three guys (Blain, Dillon & Mac) who are taller and in some cases a better athlete (Weathers) than Arnold not come close to surviving. Oh, and they are specially trained for this. But that is the way of Hollywood. Try to shape society and stop the social ills even if the truth be told, that most pilots flying the aircraft's (stats by the government) are 95% male worldwide. 
The movie, as a movie, isn't a on the edge of your seat thriller or a turn away, I'm scared movie. The acting, agian, think budget, because these 'Joes' are not Gielgud or Olivier. For that matter they are not Bill Duke or Carl Weathers.
