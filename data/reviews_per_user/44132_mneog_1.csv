Requiem for a Dream," Incredible
","I have never really felt compelled to write a review on here before but after watching this i feel i must just to tell you how much of an essential film this is.From the innocent beginning to the horrible climax ending, the film is an emotional roller-coaster throughout, so much so that i know of people who have found it impossible to watch this film more than once.The film follows four people who's search for happiness eventually becomes their downfall, and we see their world fall apart around them.You really aren't supposed to enjoy watching this film, but this does not make it a bad film by any means. The disturbingly accurate portrayal of drug addiction and breathtaking performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans contribute greatly to what is an outstanding piece of art. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, but it truly is an essential film.You have to see this film, it is truly unforgettable and if you're not left speechless at the end then you obviously have no heart at all.Never have both the words 'beautiful' and 'shocking' fitted a film so well.",10,0,1,6 March 2005
