Requiem for a Dream," If you ever consider using drugs, see this first
","Have you ever witnessed an event that not only moves you, but those around you who also witnessed it? You don't know these people, and probably won't see any of them ever again, but in the few minutes you are together and are all feeling exactly the same set of emotions, a bond exists that I couldn't hope to describe.During the closing credits of Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's new picture about 4 people whose lives spiral out of control due to drug addiction, the whole theater all but held hands and promised: 'Let's never, ever touch any of that stuff'.'Requiem' tells the the story of Sara, a middle-aged woman who becomes addicted to diet pills in her futile attempt to feel needed. Sara's son Harry is involved in drugs, he not only sells but also uses heroin, and as the movie progresses he, his girlfriend Marion and his mate Tyrone become heavily reliant on the drug. Their reliance is artfully relayed by director Aronofsky, through close ups, fast editing and exaggerated sounds of the drugs, the methods of usage, and then the obligatory dilated pupil.The end result of these addictions is disturbing for each character, and although we can see it coming from a long way off, we keep hoping that things will change for these characters. In retrospect however, it is probably for the best that we see the long term effects of drug usage, as this movie will certainly deter you from ever considering drugs. In fact, it is my opinion that this film should be shown to high school students everywhere... It may well be the one thing that gets through to them.",10,1,2,16 February 2001
