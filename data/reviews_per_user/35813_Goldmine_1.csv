Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Unique perspective?
","I am probably one of the few people not to have seen the Star Wars Trilogy so I entered the cinema with few preconceptions. Actually I was ready to be bored because the reviews of the film had been so dire. When I left the film I felt pleasantly surprised.It is disappointing in a way because the subject could have been treated in a more dark and complex way. After all it is called 'Menace' and Darth maul is not used as much as he should. At the beginning the dialogue felt stilted and Jar Jar Bing was infuriating but soon enough I was lost in the beautiful world that Lucas had created and none of this mattered.
The landscapes were beautifully rendered and the superior acting (especially Neeson and Portman) and wonderful imagination of Lucas created a real feeling of myth and legend. There were moments of pure cinema and excitement that were the best I had seen. These included the breathtaking pod race, the battle and the two fights that included Darth Maul and the Jedi Knights.They had magnificent pace and drama.
I can tell that this is not the best of the Star Wars movies and that it is not a perfect film. It has it's faults and low moments but don't believe the critics who call it boring.The greater moments save the film. It has a magic and excitement and a mythical quality that in this day and age we need.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
