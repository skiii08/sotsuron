The Longest Yard," Do not pay to see this movie
","Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. Get the original. The only thing this version improved on was the soundtrack. Even that was not a large improvement.Let's start with the obvious. Can anyone really picture Adam Sandler as a football player without flashing back to 'The Waterboy?' Aside from that, he is too scrawny to even pretend to be an NFL MVP. Very poor casting. And Chris Rock. How many times do we have to hear his 'white boy this and white boy that' schtick? Man, is it old. It stopped being funny years ago. Burt Reynolds. How much of a movie slut do you have to be to take a supporting role (played superbly by Michael Conrad in the original) in a remake of one of your best movies? I am sure that anyone under the age of 16 would love this movie. It has loud music, lots of gay jokes and bone-crunching football sequences. But the sequences are cheesy. Picture Nelly making the same stupid spin moves to break or avoid tackles and you have the bulk of the action.What really bothered me about this movie is that the director expected his audience to be stupid and had to over-explain everything. Here is a perfect example: At the end of the original, Crewe appears to be escaping and Warden Hazen tells CPT Knauer (Ed Lauter) to shoot him. You can see that Crewe won over Knauer, who can't bring himself to pull the trigger. When he realizes that Krewe is picking up the football, he slaps the rifle in Eddie Albert's chest and says, 'Game ball.' That's it. We knew what he meant and that he would be a stand-up guy. Fast forward 30 years and Peter Segal has his CPT Knauer tell Hazen, 'IT'S the game ball.' The Knauer has a heart-to-heart with Crewe to tell him that Knauer will not let Hazen falsely accuse Crewe of a crime. Thanks for the touchy-feely moment to close the movie, Segal. It was more saccharine than I could bear.Maybe someone can explain this one to me. When the police stop Crewe in his girlfriend's car, he gives them the beer he has been drinking. Just for fun, he also gives them the other five beers from the six-pack. When the car is wrecked, he gets out and salutes the TV chopper with, yes, another beer. Did he stop during the chase for another six-pack or did Segal figure that we would forget what happened one whole scene ago? Okay, I'm grousing. I did not expect this remake to be as good as the original. I also did not expect it to be such a cheesy hack of a movie.",1,1,3,14 September 2005
Man on Fire," What a Train Wreck
","I gave this film one star because I couldn't go any lower. Those were two hours I can never get back. I like a lot of Tony Scott's movies but he missed it on this one. The story had great potential and the actors were the best. The direction ruined this movie. The camera work was ridiculous; constantly speeding up and slowing down; stopping and starting; cutting to bad angles. I'm sure he was trying to be artistic but it started as annoying and went quickly to aggravating. And the subtitles...what was the deal with those? It looked like his kids got him some subtitle software for Christmas and he just had to use all those cool effects in the movie. It turned out to be childish and insulting. Let's take an example: One of the Mexican criminals gives a speech, mostly in English. Every time the character uses a Spanish word, they subtitle it, like I am too stupid to understand the context of the speech. When one of the characters slurs his speech, Scott subtitles that, too. Direct it right and you won't need the subtitles. The subtitles fade in and out, they blur, they overwrite each other. Just stupid. While I'm at it, was the mother supposed to be Southern? Some of the words she spoke with an overdone, deep South accent but the rest of the time she sounded straight out of California.You might look at my profile and think that I am too old to get it. No. The fact is, this movie was just bad. I watched it with my 16 year old son, who has a much higher tolerance for lousy movies. C'mon. He loved 'The Fast and the Furious' and 'XXX.' Even he hated it. If you watch this movie, you have only yourself to blame.",1,38,87,22 April 2005
