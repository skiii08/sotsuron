The Equalizer," good action movie
","This was a very good movie, but a little too long. The set-up was slow but I knew what was coming so was willing to wait it out. Denzel Washington's character is a former CIA-type who now lives alone and works at a home improvement store. We get to see a lot (maybe too much) of that store. Luckily, the action in this movie finally started and it eventually became explosive and non-stop. Very fun to watch! Many of the characters were pretty one-note, with the exception of the villain and Chloe Moretz as a prostitute. Those two were very good. The other characters simply served the purpose of the story -- which basically was to let Denzel Washington beat people up and outsmart them single- handedly. You can see this was set up to have a sequel.",7,0,3,13 October 2014
