Source Code," Decent Enough Sci-Fi Thriller With A Solid Lead From Jake Gyllenhaal
","Pros:
1. Jake Gyllenhaal (Colter Stevens) per usual gives a brilliant performance.
2. The train setting gives the film an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia which helps to increase the tension.
3. The CGI, in regards to the train, fire, explosions looks surprisingly good. The movie also knows never to over-rely on it.
4. The pacing is fantastic. With a limited plot, it's always a high risk that the movie will start to feel repetitive, however this film keeps the same pace and manages to stay fresh.
5. The ending is simultaneously heartwarming and satisfying.Cons:
1. The score is extremely overbearing and obnoxious, as well as the fact that it's mostly just stock action music.
2. The film's lighting makes the movie look really cheap and bland.
3. Derek Frost's (Michael Arden) motives for blowing up the train are very weak. He states the 'world is hell,' and therefore it needs to be reduced to rubble. This reduces the tension, and it induces an eye-roll.
4. There are a few plot-holes. For example: somehow Colter Steven's dad didn't recognise his own son's voice over the phone; the film never explains how Colter Stevens' consciousness can be broadcast into a dead person's memory; and at the end, a new world is mysteriously created with no explanation.",6,0,1,21 May 2020
Match Point," The Plot Is Really Boring, And Only Gets Going Towards The End. Scarlett Johansson Puts In A Decent Performance
","Pros:
1. The operatic soundtrack is not only a delight to listen to, but it does a great job at building up intimacy and tension.
2. The sex scenes are appropriately sensual and romantic.
3. Scarlett Johansson (Nola Rice) gives as good as a performance as she can give.
4. The conclusion is strangely satisfying, and it ends up concluding the story in an unexpected, but satisfying manner.Cons:
1. Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Chris Wilton) puts on an awfully distracting fake posh English accent.
2. The dialogue, specifically in regards to the romantic triangle, is incredibly clunky, cheesy, and too in-your-face.
3. Chris Wilton as the main character is exceedingly unlikable, and only becomes interesting towards the end of the film.
4. Chris Wilton is introduced as an ex-tennis player, yet it becomes clear quite quickly that it's irrelevant to the plot.
5. The movie, aside from the last 15-20 minutes, is full of forced melodrama that is, for want of a better word, boring.
6. There is absolutely no set-up to the thriller turn, and although it's the most entertaining part of the movie, it feels massively out-of-place.",5,0,2,22 May 2020
Zodiac," A Great David Fincher Serial Killer Thriller
","Pros:
1. The directing and framing of shots are incredibly impressive, and they're definitely the best I've seen from a David Fincher (Director) movie.
2. The dark lighting perfectly bathes the film in a brooding and gritty atmosphere.
3. The tension and suspense is masterfully built-up via the lighting, and the intermittent usage of the score mixed in with purposefully dense silences.
4. The score helps to ram home a nerve-wracking feel, which keeps you on edge through the entire experience.
5. The costume design is fantastic, and mirrors the time period, irrespective of whether it be the '60s, '70s, and even the short snippets of the '80s, and '90s.
6. The comedy is appropriately used sporadically, but is genuinely funny and it prevents the movie from becoming too depressive and heavy.
7. The inquiry scene between Bob Vaughn (Charles Fleischer) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is utterly captivating, and is one of the most nervy scenes in cinema that I have ever seen.
8. The flashing up of times and dates gives the film a strict structure, which is desperately needed due to the substance of the plot.
9. Charles Fleischer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo (Inspector David Toschi), and Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery) all deliver brilliant performances.Cons:
1. During the middle of the movie, the pacing slows down a little, especially as the Zodiac Killer becomes a secondary character.
2. Robert Graysmith has weak motivations for pursuing the identity of the Zodiac Killer, and when asked about his motivations, he just spurts out empty words, like: 'I just have to know who he is.'",8,0,0,25 May 2020
Horrible Bosses," Fun Little Comedy To Pass Away The Time
","Pros:
1. The comedy is laugh-out-loud hilarious and almost never fails to procure a laugh.
2. Jason Bateman (Nick Hendricks), Charlie Day (Dale Arbus), and Jason Sudeikis (Kurt Buckman) have terrific chemistry together.
3. Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman deliver great comedic performances. Colin Farrell (Bobby Pellit), Kevin Spacey (Dave Harken), and Jennifer Aniston (Dr. Julia Harris) do a great job at appearing evil and you genuinely detest their characters.
4. The soundtrack does a really good job at adding a fun bounce to the movie.
5. The pacing is not too slow or fast, thus helping to keep your attention until the end.
6. All of the bosses, for the most part, receive an extremely satisfying comeuppance.Cons:
1. A couple of the jokes fall a little flat.
2. The exposing of Dave Harken to the police via Atmanand (Brian George) informing the police of his sound recording functions is a little bizarre. There is no AI software that is that well-developed.",7,0,0,14 April 2020
The Passion of Joan of Arc," A Mind-Blowing Silent Film Masterpiece (Almost)
","Pros:
1. There is not a weak performance in sight, with Maria Falconetti (Jeanne d'Arc), Eugene Silvain (Évêque Pierre Cauchon), and Antonin Artaud (Jean Massieu) standing out as exceptional.
2. The score wonderfully emulates and induces every emotion from: hope, despondency, sadness, fear, grief, and more.
3. The set and costume design are great and build up the 15th century world greatly.
4. The cinematography is fantastic. The framing is incredible, and the zoom-ins and close-ups help to add so much weight to every scene.
5. The long and intense pauses are incredibly powerful in hitting home the emotions to the viewer.
6. The dialogue, although it's in written form to be congruent with the silent film model, is captivating, and almost ethereal in its structure and delivery.
7. The pacing is perfect, despite the limited setting and constricting plot. The movie never once feels tired or outstays its welcome.
8. The death of Jeanne d'Arc is simultaneously enthralling, beautifully shot, and exceedingly sad.
9. The film serves as a fitting tribute to Jeanne d'Arc, by detailing her indomitable faith, the virulent church suppression, as well as her staunch French nationalism.Cons:
1. Jeanne d'Arc was famously a teenager, and it's blatantly obvious that Maria Falconetti is much older than that (she was 35).
2. The ending riot scene feels rather unnecessary.",9,0,0,2 May 2020
21 Jump Street," Laugh-Out-Loud Family Fun
","Pros:
1. The comedy is of entirely laugh-out-loud quality and it never fails to produce a laugh.
2. The film knows when and how to appropriately insert tender moments which add to the dynamic between the two protagonists.
3. There is fantastic chemistry between Jonah Hill (Schmidt) and Channing Tatum (Jenko).
4. Both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill give brilliant comedic performances, with Ice Cube (Captain Dickson) offering up a very good side performance.
5. The movie does a good job at presenting the changes between high school generations, especially with Schmidt and Jenko finding themselves in inverse social statuses to the ones they had assumed in their high school days.
6. The score, though nothing special, performs well to add to the atmosphere it's played in - whether it be during an action scene, or an emotional one.
7. Both Schmidt and Jenko have nice little character arcs with Jenko becoming more knowledgeable and responsible, and and Schmidt becoming more confident and freer.
8. The pacing is great despite it's paper-thin plot.Cons:
1. Somehow Schmidt and Jenko pass for high-schoolers even though they look way older.
2. The film sets up a bizarre romantic relationship between Schmidt and Molly Tracey (Brie Larson) even though it's wholly inappropriate considering the age-gap.
3. Some of the editing is a little obnoxious.",8,1,1,8 April 2020
Justice League," Other Than Some Impressive Visuals, This Film Is Trash From Start-To-Finish
","Pros:
1. As usual with Zack Snyder (Director) films, there are some really impressive, and eye-catching, visuals.Cons:
1. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) whip induces people to tell the truth. However, when she ensnares a henchman in it, he somehow avoids telling the truth by answering a question she didn't ask.
2. The acting is pretty terrible for the most part, but especially from Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck (Batman/ Bruce Wayne).
3. The special effects look absolutely awful, with stand-outs being Henry Cavill's (Superman/ Clark Kent) missing mustache, and Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) himself.
4. The action scenes all just devolve into CGI schlock-fests that are wholly unengaging and boring to watch.
5. The humour falls extraordinarily flat, particularly with the character of The Flash/ Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) whose main role seems to be supplying annoying and inappropriate one-liners and jokes.
6. Steppenwolf has no motivation for his actions other than conquering. This makes his character bland and uninteresting.
7. The score is way too cheesy and overbearing at times.
8. The dialogue is incredibly clunky and mostly serves to force-feed the audience exposition.
9. It's obvious that the outside locations are all clearly filmed on a Hollywood studio set, and it's made even more blatant by the ugly artificial lighting.",1,5,20,20 May 2020
Grease," Go Greased Lighting!
","Pros:
1. The film is brimming with well-written, well-sung, and catchy songs. Certain songs such as, 'Summer Nights', 'Greased Lightning', and 'You're the One I Want' became - and still are - classics.
2. The choreography is fantastic, especially in regards to the dance numbers and the car race.
3. The humour lands and stems from genuine high school banter.
4. There is mesmerising chemistry between all of the actors and it really pays-off onscreen.
5. The set and costume design look amazing and they set the 1950's feel superbly.
6. The movie does a great job at highlighting how differently men and women approach love and relationships.
7. Both John Travolta (Danny) and Olivia Newton-John (Sandy) give really good performances.
8. The film leaves you with an appropriate feel-good feeling.Cons:
1. All of the actors are clearly not in their teens, and it's really distracting.
2. The acting at times is rather over-the-top.
3. Some lines of dialogue have clearly been added post-production.",8,0,0,7 April 2020
District 9," A Great Sci-Fi Thriller That Touches Upon Real Human Issues
","Pros:
1. The creature design is phenomenal. Everything from their physical look to their mannerisms and voices is just phenomenal. Moreover, the CGI used for them still holds up 11 years later.
2. The gore is hard-hitting, well-designed, and brutal to witness.
3. The film incorporates well-implemented commentary regarding the treatment of refugees, ethnic/ racial conflict, and the under-the-table government and private business dealings and abuses. The themes are never obnoxious and they provide wonderful structure to the plot.
4. The colour palette does a fantastic job at providing a bleak and oppressive atmosphere which suits the plight of the prawns.
5. Sharlto Copley (Wikus Van De Merwe) gives an amazing performance.
6. The action scenes are entertaining, enthralling, and extremely fast-paced.
7. The score does a great job at upping the tension and suspense.
8. Koobus Venter (David James) is on the receiving end of an extremely satisfactory and well-suiting death.
9. All of the sub-plots conclude neatly and greatly.Cons:
1. The interviews at the beginning of the movie don't feel genuine as they're presented in a documentary-esque manner. They feel like just what they are - people acting and providing exposition.
2. The humans and the prawns both speak different languages to each other, yet they also understand each other. Why don't they just speak the same language then?",9,0,0,11 April 2020
Cars," Good Family Nostalgic Fun
","Pros:
1. Some of the animation is absolutely beautiful, especially in regards to the Grand Canyon imagery.
2. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has a great character arc from beginning as an egoistic narcissist, to a selfless humbled individual who is eager to learn from those around them.
3. The humour mostly lands and produces some genuinely funny and heartwarming moments.
4. The race scenes are really fun to watch and are well made and built-up to.
5. There is fantastic voice-acting from Larry the Cable Guy (Mater), Tony Shalhoub (Luigi), and Guido Quaroni (Guido).
6. The ending is suitably heartwarming and concludes the plot succinctly.Cons:
1. Some of the animation is a little dated.
2. A couple of the feel-good moments are a little too cheesy and unnecessary.
3. There is a running gag about cow-tractors that falls flat after its introduction.
4. Owen Wilson fares poorly as a leading man, even when he's a disembodied voice.",7,0,0,5 April 2020
La Grande Illusion," One Of The Best Anti-War Films Ever Made
","Pros:
1. The costume design is fantastic and it almost makes you forget that the movie was filmed nearly 20 years after World War One ended.
2. There is amazing chemistry between all of the characters, and it really is the life-force of the film.
3. The nationalist singing hall scene is well-sung, really entertaining, and it genuinely sent shivers down my spine.
4. Jean Gabin (Le lieutenant Maréchal), Pierre Fresnay (Le captaine de Boeldieu), Julien Carette (Cartier - l'acteur), and Erich von Stroheim (Le captaine von Rauffenstein) all give fantastic performances.
5. The humour is well-crafted and hilarious, and the witty remarks never fail to produce a laugh.
6. The score does an amazing job at cementing the feelings of mischief, adventure, as well as heartbreak.
7. The death of Le captaine de Boeldieu is an utterly saddening moment, especially when Le captaine von Rauffenstein resigns himself to closing his eyes.
8. The movie provides a subtle critique of war by showing that men of the different armies (whether they be French, German, or British) have many similarities. Le captaine de Boeldieu explicitly acknowledges this when he pardons Le captaine von Rauffenstein for shooting him, by stating: 'French or German, duty is duty.'Cons:
1. The first 13 minutes were massively out of sync with the audio. I'm not sure whether that was the film, or just Mubi messing up. Either way, it was incredibly distracting.
2. The second half of the movie starts to drag a little bit.",9,0,1,22 May 2020
Evil Dead," Gory, Gory, Gory
","Pros:
1. Jane Levy (Mia) gives an amazingly bone-chilling performance.
2. There is a minimum reliance on CGI, and the CGI that is implemented is done so appropriately and to really good effect.
3. The gore is well-designed, brutal, and unforgiving.
4. The dark and dull colour palette helps to reinforce the tense and foreboding atmosphere.
5. Abomination Mia (Randal Wilson) is on the receiving end of an extremely satisfying death.Cons:
1. The acting, for the most part, during the first half of the film is really wooden.
2. The dialogue is really clunky and forced, especially when the character of Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) delivers the exposition.
3. The score is often incredibly overbearing and annoying.
4. Some moments of horror are unintentionally funny as they are presented in a cartoonish manner.
5. A couple of the characters, unsurprisingly with these types of horror, make moronic character decisions to prolong the horror.
6. The last 10 minutes are almost entirely unnecessary.",5,0,0,1 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fantastic Start To The Harry Potter Story
","Pros:
1. The sound design is incredible, especially in regards to the spell-casting. It really makes the magic come alive.
2. The score is great and created one of the most iconic scores of all time. It still gives me chills when it plays.
3. The practical and special effects are done well, and still hold up nearly 20 years later for the most part.
4. The costume and set design are immense and they do an amazing job at helping to build the wizarding world.
5. There is fantastic chemistry between all of the actors onscreen and it's beautiful to watch, especially between Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger),and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley).
6. The likes of Emma Watson, Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Ian Hart (Professor Quirrell), and Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) give really good performances.
7. There is some really exquisite and innovative camera-work. One brilliant example of this would be the shot of the owls entering the great hall to deliver the mail.
8. The action scenes are enthralling and well-choreographed, particularly in regards to the quidditch and the chess game sequences.Cons:
1. There is some strange directing choices involving framing and zoom-ins.
2. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe is a little patchy at times.
3. Admittedly, some of the special effects haven't aged well at all.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
The Disaster Artist," Truly A Great Tribute To Tommy Wiseau
","Pros:
1. James Franco (Tommy Wiseau) gives a phenomenal performance and nails Tommy Wiseau perfectly.
2. James and Dave Franco (Greg), unsurprisingly, have incredible chemistry together.
3. The comedy is comedy gold, and it stems naturally from the character of Tommy Wiseau, as well as the character interactions.
4. Despite the over-the-top nature of the film, at its heart, it's about a lonely, misunderstood man who desperately seeks acceptance, respect, and friendship.
5. The emotional moments actually land, and land well.
6. It's a genuinely heartwarming and satisfying moment at the end when Tommy Wiseau embraces the standing ovation given after his showing of The Room (2003).
7. The ending credits comparison between The Disaster Artist (2017) and The Room (2003) are nicely done and entertaining to watch.Cons:
1. There is minor usage of unnecessary and annoying shaky cam.
2. The score is slightly overbearing at times during the supposedly tender moments.
3. The movie is over-edited and has far too many cuts.
4. The conflict presented is horribly rushed through and is explored nowhere near as deeply as it should be.",8,0,0,19 April 2020
Hancock," The cinematography and Plot Lets The Film Down, But Still A Solid Attempt At An Anti-Hero Movie
","Pros:
1. Both Will Smith (John Hancock) and Charlize Theron (Mary) give great performances.
2. The emotional scenes, with thanks to the acting and well-timed pauses, land with great effect.
3. The humour is fantastically dry and dark, which prevents the film from becoming stale.
4. The action scenes are well-choreographed and entertaining.
5. The CGI and special effects, aside from a couple instances, look great and still hold up 12 years later.Cons:
1. There are a plethora of really strange editing and camera angles which take you out of the viewing experience.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, why did Red (Eddie Marsan) only take Man Mountain (David Mattey) and Matrix (Maetrix Fitten) to confront Hancock at the hospital, after it had already been established that most of the prison population was there because of Hancock?
3. During the action scenes, obnoxious and corny stock action music is played.
4. The movie doesn't focus enough on the philosophical reasoning behind a superhero negating their duties, and whether or not they should have free will to decide their superhero role.
5. The entire sequence featuring Hancock and Mary fighting in LA not only has the worst looking special effects, but the conflict just feels really forced.",6,0,0,22 June 2020
Life," Decent Enough Alien Sci-Fi Thriller, But With Quite A Few Problems
","Pros:
1. The set design is incredible. Not only does it resemble a real space station, but it gives the film an increased sense of claustrophobia thus adding to the horror.
2. The score does a great job at adding to the dense and thrilling atmosphere.
3. There is fantastic creature design and CGI to go along with it.
4. There are some really impressive visuals, especially in regards to the outer space scenes.
5. Jake Gyllenhaal (David Jordan) as usual gives a really good performance.Cons:
1. Some lines of dialogue look dubbed, or they sound as if they were added post-production.
2. The CGI blood looks utterly horrendous.
3. There are a couple of plot-holes. For example, how did Calvin attach itself to Hugh Derry's (Ariyon Bakare) leg without him or anybody else noticing?
4. The characters are poorly fleshed out which makes it difficult to care about them.
5. The twist at the end of the movie is ruined by the film showing too much of the commotion between Calvin and David Jordan.",6,0,0,12 May 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," A Decent Comedy If Just A Little Repetitive
","Pros:
1. The comedy, when it lands, is of laugh-out-loud quality: 'I think of it like this: if you were going to eat a sandwich, you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.'
2. The set and costume design are fantastic and really help to seal the vampiric gothic feel.
3. The gore and practical effects look really good and are proof that a big budget isn't necessary to pull that kind of thing off.
4. Taika Waititi (Viago), Jemaine Clement (Vladislav), and Jonny Brugh (Deacon) give great comedic performances.
5. Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi have tremendous chemistry with each other, and it is unequivocally the engine behind the film.
6. The score not only matches the gothic theme of the movie, but it also helps to breathe a little life into the film to prevent it from becoming stale.Cons:
1. At times, the comedy feels a little forced and inappropriate.
2. The film, especially during the second half, starts to drag and it feels a little repetitive.",7,0,1,4 May 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Quirky And Entertaining Nod To Old-School Spy Films
","Pros:
1. The opening scene with Lancelot (Jack Davenport) dispatching a bunch of goons, only to then ultimately meet his own demise by Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), is really stylish and compelling.
2. The action scenes are well-shot, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining. The first bar fight and the mesmerising church fight stand out as prolific examples.
3. The editing is done really well. The fast and quick-cut edits, in particular, help the fight scenes to pop more.
4. The score and soundtrack are used superbly to build up tension, suspense, drama, chaos, sadness, and everything inbetween.
5. The humour is inserted well, it produces charming moments - especially between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Galahad (Colin Firth) - and it's never too ridiculous or distracting.
6. The film provides an empowering message of taking responsibility for yourself and learning to overcome your natural disadvantages.
7. Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) gives an amazing performance as an old-school over-the-top spy villain.
8. Galahad's death is shocking and impactful, especially as he served as a father figure for Eggsy.Cons:
1. Somehow, when Gazelle fights Princess Tilde's (Hanna Alström) bodyguards, she's able to dodge close-range bullets by simply moving her head.
2. During the parachute training scene, there is obvious use of green-screen which is a little distracting.",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Shark Tale," Dumb Family-Friendly Fun
","Pros:
1. Will Smith (Oscar), Martin Scorsese (Sykes), and Jack Black (Lenny) all deliver great voice-acting performances.
2. The film serves as a fantastic allegory for accepting people for who they are, as well as critiquing obsession with wealth and fame. The latter being especially important in this day-and-age where celebrity-worship is ubiquitous.
3. The soundtrack is fun and bouncy and gives the film an airy and light-hearted feel.
4. The humour is mostly slap-stick and lands well for the most part.
5. The ending is largely satisfying and ends the movie on a suitably heartfelt note.
6. Will Smith and Jack Black have really good chemistry with each other.Cons:
1. The animation is extremely dated and at times, the animation is incredibly distractingly bad.
2. There are a few plot-holes here-and-there: How did Lenny pass as a dolphin, when he's quite clearly painted blue? How did Lenny one-bite through a steel anchor chain? How did Don Lino (Robert De Niro) not know who the shark slayer was at first, when he was being promoted everywhere throughout the media?
3. Angelina Jolie (Lola) gives a rather lacklustre voice-acting performance.
4. Some of the comedy is inserted rather forcefully and jarringly.
5. At the end when Oscar finally comes clean about lying about slaying sharks, everyone just accepts it and he faces no ramifications. It's rather unbelievable.",5,0,0,3 May 2020
The Martian," Entertaining Space Adventure Overseeing A Spaceman Fighting To Survive
","Pros:
1. The costume and set design are are incredible and intricately designed.
2. The futuristic score and Disco soundtrack does a great job at suiting the space setting, as well as helping the film a lift when needed.
3. Matt Damon (Mark Watney) gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is inserted well, and does an amazing job at preventing the movie from becoming too dark.
5. The cinematography is really eye-catching, especially the stunning and breathtaking shots of Mars.
6. All of the characters make intelligent and deep character decisions, which makes every decision hit harder, in addition to fully empathising with the characters and their ordeal.
7. When Mark Watney is finally reunited with Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), it is a genuinely emotional scene.Cons:
1. There is some dodgy shaky cam in the beginning.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, If NASA hates fire (including items that can contribute to fire), how come they let Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) bring a wooden crucifix to Mars? Surely they would check personal items taken by the astronauts? Another example would be the Chinese choosing to sacrifice their technology secrets to save an American astronaut; they would never do this in the real world.
3. The movie doesn't focus enough on the psychological impacts that being left alone, with very little hope of escape, on a strange planet would do to a person.
4. When narrating messages, the film bizarrely has the receiver and the sender both read out the message. You only need one.
5. Some of the characters are given very little, if anything, to do. This includes both Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig).",7,0,0,13 May 2020
