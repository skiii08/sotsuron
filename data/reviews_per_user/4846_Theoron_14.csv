Minority Report," Film noir is alive and well in 2054...
","Once again we see the proof that God loves us and wants good things for his children, for another Phillip K. Dick story has been ordained to be shown on the Great Silver Screen.  Mr. Dick is the man whose sacred writings were the basis for the films Blade Runner and Total Recall, amongst a few others. Not only can we celebrate the visualization of another Dick short, but we can also give thanks that  it has been crafted in the blessed hands of Steven Spielberg and filmed by the extremely gifted Janusz Kaminski.  This is the movie equivalent of Sir George Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performing Beethoven --it just doesn't get much better than this.
In the not-to-distant future, human beings with special 'precognitive' abilities (whatever the hell 'precognitive' means...)  will be able to see a murder before it happens.  Through the use of some really nifty technology, the police will be able to see the visions of these murders displayed on a screen, hopefully giving them enough clues to find the murderer and the scene of the crime before it even takes place.  How successful is this system?  In six years, not a single murder has actually been committed in the city where it has been initially deployed, Washington D.C. (Fortunately,  they must have installed some sort of filter to keep the 'pre-cogs' from seeing the into the inner workings of the federal government, whose crimes would certainly overwhelm the system.)But of course the questions must arise: just how 'perfect' is this system? Is there any way in which somebody with a bit of moxie might be able to take advantage of the system, and commit murders that look as if they were committed by someone else?   Is there a way to bait someone into murdering who otherwise would not have dreamt doing such a thing?   Well, officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) -- a 'true believer' when it comes to the pre-crime system, now finds himself asking these very questions when he sees HIMSELF on the big screen, blowing holes in a guy he doesn't even know with his police service pistol.  So the race is on for him to prove his innocence, and show that the system he once put his faith in isn't so fool-proof after all.I'm no longer a big fan of Tom Cruise (MI:2 anyone?) and go out of my way -not- to see his films.  However, the Spielburg/Kaminski/Dick trifecta had me hooked, so I ignored my trusty 'Cruise Control' and went to see the film. To sum up, I might become a Cruise fan once again, for he certainly played the role of Officer Anderton with great intelligence and feeling.  He is surprisingly reserved, using emotion and feeling in a realistic and convincing manner.  There were even times when I forgot it was Tom Cruise on the screen, and one can't pay a higher compliment than that.The Spielburg/Kaminski team scores many points throughout the course of movie-- artsy camera angles, tremendous detail, excellent pacing and fine story telling.  It seems as if the Dynamic Duo of motion pictures is continuing with a trend that was brought forth in their previous film 'AI.' In Minority Report, we see the continued evolution of these ideas into even more fantastic organisms and creatures.  But best of all, Spielberg understands that CGI is a prop, not a movie enhancement mechanism, and uses CGI in a very intelligent fashion to help tell the story, rather than hitting us over the head with over-done digital potpourri, 'ala Attack of the Clones.Unlike many of the directors of the last 30 years, Spielburg is getting much better with age.  Riddley Scott is the only other I can say that about. (Lucas, & Coppola are most definitely in their descendancy, Scorsese has gotten neither better nor worst...)  It certainly seems like he is becoming the second incarnation of Stanley Kubrick, going after more cerebral and philosophic works.  With 'Minority Report,' Spielburg has a story that makes excellent use of his talents.  It is now my favorite Phillip Dick inspired film, even beating out BladeRunner.The icing on the Minority Report cake is the wonderful presence of the greatest actor who's ever walked the earth: Max von Sydow.  It's very clear that Max is back!  He gives a powerful, controlled performance as Lamar Burgess, the co-founder of the pre-crime unit. Every second von Sydow is on screen is like manna from heaven, and I found myself greedily eating up every bit of it.   Whoever made this casting choice deserves a gold star.But it would not be fair to praise only Cruise and von Sydow, for every actor in this film does an outstanding job.  There may be flaws in Minority Report, but performances is not one of them.  A special treat is Lois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman, the person responsible for the initial development of the pre-crime system.  If nothing else, go see this film and watch Iris wrap Tom Cruise around her little finger.This may be billed as a sci-fi film, but it's really just plain old film noir set in the year 2054.  But it's one of the best noirs since 'L.A. Confidential.'  And like most noir, it has plot holes that Orson Welles could waltz through and convenient plot twists which the bad guys must always fall into --it just wouldn't be noir without it.   But much credit goes to Phillip Dick, Scott Frank and Jon Cohen for writing solid dialogue and creating ideas that help bridge those gaping chasms.Overall, I sat in my seat eating up every minute of celluloid and ignoring my popcorn.   A stunning visual treat for the eyes, a good nutritional feast for the brain, and an exhausting workout for one's emotions.   But most importantly, Minority Report is a liturgy of fun, excellence and intrigue that will send your spirit soaring in adoration to the Almighty for blessing us with the incarnation of St. Spielburg.  May the Lord be with you.",9,0,0,26 July 2002
Shakespeare in Love," 'SHAKESPEARE IN LUST' would have been a more appropriate title...
","'Playwrites teach us nothing of love' says Queen Elizabeth in this film. She might as well add 'either do screenwriters....''Shakespeare in Love' has many qualities that make it a better than average film.   The sets are excellent, the costumes are beautiful, and the acting,for the most part, was first rate.   The script is witty, and filled with cute, little 'inside jokes' for those familiar with the plays and literature of Elizabethan England.That being said, in my opinion there are some serious flaws, which cause it to be quite a bit inferior to other films nominated for the Â‘98 Oscars.  Yet it is obvious that what I consider to be 'flaws,' Hollywood considers 'virtues.'   My review is for those who find this film to be less than virtuous.The only thing this film has in common with the historical Shakespeare is the name 'Shakespeare.'   This is a highly fictionalized account of his life; however, I do not consider this a flaw.   It is obvious that the writers are using Shakespeare as a vehicle to create a parable of the Hollywood film industry, complete with sex, money and psychoanalysts.  The use of Shakespeare for this end is actually quite clever.  In this day and age, where biographers feel free to inject themselves as a fictional character into the 'historical'  biographies they write, then this fictionalization of Shakespeare is par for the course.   The screenwriters also are interested in presenting a possible motivation for Shakespeare's writing of 'Romeo and Juliet:' Shakespeare was madly in love at the time. Yet it is in the handling of the 'love' story that I've encountered the film's most serious flaw.The film's two lead characters; 'Shakespeare' played by Joe Fiennes and 'Viola' played be Gwyneth Paltrow; have a mutual 'love-at-first-sight' attraction to each another.   This attraction is quickly followed up by consummation in Viola's bedroom - an activity in which the two of them engage in rather frequently throughout the course of the film.  Often they recite lines from 'Romeo and Juliet' to each other while copulating.About midway through the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) states 'Playwrites teach us nothing of love;  they make it pretty, they make it comical or they make it lust - they cannot make it true.' This piece of dialogue is the hinge upon which this whole film turns - and with it a wager is struck in response to the queen's  query: 'Can a play show us the very truth and nature in love?'Of course a play can show us the very truth and nature in love - hence the film's thesis: the motivation behind Shakespeare's writing of 'Romeo and Juliet!'  Unfortunately, the film attempts, by association,  to take that challenge upon itself as well.  In my opinion, it fails miserably.   This is just another example of a pretty, comical, and lusty Hollywood film - nothing more.  I did not come away with an enlightened viewpoint of love and truth - rather I thought it more of a highbrow pseudo porn flick.  Sorry - two lovers reciting Shakespeare to each other while doing the horizontal bop does not bring clarity to the meaning of 'love' to this reviewer.As I stated earlier, this is not an Oscar caliber film, and didn't even deserve the nomination.  All the other nominated films were far more ambitious and told much more compelling stories.  So why then DID this film get nominated - let alone win best picture???Well, one has to keep in perspective the two films before it that have won Oscars - 'The English Patient' and 'Titanic.'   'Shakespeare in Love' kept lockstep with the philosophical underpinnings of those two films, and by towing the party line, endeared itself to the Hollywood elite who votes for these things.'The English Patient', 'Titanic', and 'Shakespeare in Love' all deal with a woman either promised to or married to a man who they either despise or find less than desirable.   Then comes along the 'love of their lives,' and, despite the woman's engagement/marriage convenant, they go  off and embrace their 'forbidden love.'  Hence we are subtlety told that marriage/engagement is an evil that keeps one from finding true happiness.  In order for these films to work, they have to resort to times and places where woman had much less freedom of choice than they do today.  But the underlying message remains the same for all three.In Hollywood USA, marriage is probably viewed in that way by many involved in the entertainment industry: a sort of ancient, masochistic custom that has outlived its usefulness.  Any film that portrays marriage as an obstacle rather than a blessing finds quite a receptive audience amongst the moral relativists who make up the film industry.  (One wonders why many entertainers even bother with marriage at all.Keeping this in mind, one sees how the other films could not possibly win.'Elizabeth' shows the process by which QE1 becomes the 'virgin queen.'   If there's any subject that could be considered taboo in Hollywood, then virginity has to be it.  Hence, this film didn't have a chance.`Saving Private Ryan' was a throwback to old fashioned ideas like 'duty,' 'honor,' and worst of all, 'self-sacrifice' - none of which play that well in modern day Southern California (except when the sacrifice of self is used for the preservation of the 'forbidden love...')    'The Thin Red Line' - makes the terrible error of showing how one's adultery can have a rather negative impact on the adulterer's spouse - a concept unheard of in the land of self-indulgence without consequences.   And don't even get me started on 'Life is Beautiful....'If you think that 'Shakespeare in Love' WAS the best film of '98, then I have a few others for you to try on for size: 'Savior,' 'Pi,' 'Rushmore' and 'Dark City.'  They all are far more compelling than SIL could ever hope to be.",4,2,5,20 October 1999
Finding Nemo," Fish ARE food...not friends...
","I've just finished a nice snack of eel sushi, and a dinner featuring a very nice ahi tuna steak, so I'm now well prepared to begin my review of Pixar's latest creation: `Finding Nemo.'  I highly recommend a nice seafood dinner before, or perhaps even after watching this film.Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a clown fish, and the only survivor of a brood of hundreds.  While still an embryo, a mean old fish eating barracuda (are there any other kind?) decides that a nice clown fish caviar is the order of the day, and snorks down all of Nemo's brothers & sisters, not to mention his mother Coral.  Nemo's only surviving relative is his father Marlin (Albert Brooks), who, needless to say, is a bit distraught after having lost most of his family in a couple of bites.Naturally, Marlin becomes a bit overprotective of his last remaining child, and poor Nemo feels a bit put-upon.  In a moment of childish rebellion, Nemo swims out to the open ocean to where a boat is anchored.  Sadly, the occupants of the boat, who just happened to be scuba diving, decide Nemo would make a great addition to their saltwater aquarium (in a dentist's office, no less).  So Nemo is snatched away, and forced to live a life behind glass in Sydney, Australia.Marlin, with the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the short-term memory-challenged blue tang, seeks to track down little Nemo, and hopefully bring him back to his rightful home amongst the sea anemone.This is Pixar's fifth feature creation, and one of their most visually interesting.  Sadly, one can't say the same for the story line, for it's about as original and captivating as a dinner at McDonald's.  Marlin, father of the lost Nemo, is a bit paranoid.  It's funny for the first few milliseconds, then becomes just annoying as the paranoia continues unabated until nearly the very end.  And Dory's early onset of Alzheimer's isn't funny at all, no matter what.  I think the Pixar people meant this stuff to be funny, but I've seen funnier bits in any given 10 minutes of `Sponge Bob Square Pants' than in this entire film.The best part of the movie is Nemo's adventures in his new saltwater aquarium home in the dentist's office.  The cast of fish characters he encounters there, and their fascination with dentistry, is one of the truly enjoyable parts of the show.Yet what little sparks of joy one encounters is leveraged with some rather negative and strange characterizations that make you wonder if there was some sort of secret agenda at work amongst the animators.  As usual with modern-day children's films based in the animal kingdom, carnivores are shown to be mean, cruel, heartless villains.  And if one encounters a `nice' carnivore, it's only because they've sworn off eating flesh.  There is a cute scene where we encounter three sharks that are members of `Fish Eaters Anonymous,' but we quickly discover that the sharks are having as hard a time being vegetarians as we do thinking that such a thing is even likely.
As for the highly praised CGI visuals, well, the Pixar folks have really outdone themselves.  However, as CGI starts looking more and more `real' -one can no longer compare it to animation, but to actual photography. They have succeeded in entering a strange new paradox where CGI must now be compared to acutal underwater films, and in that regard, the visuals in `Finding Nemo' are not that impressive, as compared to a standard-issue Greet Barrier Reef documentary on the Discovery Channel.  It's really good animation, but not nearly so good as the real McCoy.In all the other Pixar films, where there are humans, they are usually shown in a positive light, like Andy from `Toy Story' and Boo from `Monster's Inc.'  If there's a human villain, he's usually countered by a human who is kind, like the Andy/Sid dualism of `Toy Story.'  But in `Finding Nemo,' we mainly see humans as either captors of poor, harmless fish or as catchers of poor, harmless fish. Casting aquarium hobbyists as villains is troubling, especially for a person like myself who has always enjoyed public and private aquariums, and has learned a great deal about our aquatic friends from such displays.  It does not help showing fisherman as depriving fish of their civil rights, as though tuna and cod really are sentient beings.  Is the catching, eating and displaying of fish truly a dark, sinister activity that we should avoid? It seems as if that is one of the messages of this particular film, one this reviewer does like at all.However, I do agree that humans are certainly the greatest enemy to the oceans and to sea life, but it isn't aquarium hobbyists and fisherman who are the greatest threat, but corporate fishing fleets and industrial polluters.  But the film has nothing to say or show concerning these two very real problems.  Instead, humans in general are shown to be a vegetarian fish's greatest antagonist.Aside from the `fish are friends, not food' message of the film, there is another, more important and more forthright theme, and that is a father's unconditional love for his son, even though the son deliberately rebelled against his father's overbearing protection.  There is also a neat message about overcoming one's fears by plowing right into that which you fear, which sometimes is the best way to handle certain neuroses.  But overall, the main messages of the film were diluted by the negative characterizations of humans and carnivores.  Any film that causes you to feel guilt and shame for having enjoyed aquariums and seafood does deserve high marks.Well, at least there was a sushi restaurant in 'Monster's Inc.,' so perhaps there's some hope for the Pixar folks after all.  As for this film, wonderful CGI visuals, mediocre story.  Yes, it has heart, but not nearly enough.My Rating: 4/10",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
The Polar Express," Polar Express is more incredible than 'The Incredibles'
","I must admit I had low expectations as I walked into the theater to see Polar Express. I had seen 'The Incredibles' just a short time earlier, and was amazed at how good that film was, perhaps the best film of 2004. I did not think Polar Express or any other movie could possibly top it. I was wrong. Polar Express may be the best movie of 2004, so farÂ…When creating a film from an incredibly popular and well-know book like Chris Van Allsburg's 'Polar Express,' I had wrongly believed that the Hollywood types could only screw it up, make it boring, and fill it with lots of Jerry Bruckeimer-type special effects that would only distract us from the wonderful story. Again, I was wrong.The film 'Polar Express' does an absolutely wonderful job of capturing the two best aspects of Van Allsburg's book: the artwork and the message. The computer techniques used to tell this story are, by far, the best use of computer animation I've ever seen. Nothing that Disney or Pixar has done even comes close. The look and feel of Van Allsburg's wonderful artwork is completely intact, and in some ways, even exceeded. It's like watching a beautiful oil painting come to life. The film, if nothing else, is an absolute feast for the eyes, I was completely in awe from the opening minutes to the closing credits. I truly did not want to watch this banquet of beauty and light to end.But of course there's more to a movie than visualization, and the simple, but powerful tale of a boy out-growing the need to believe in Santa Claus is very well done. In the book 'Polar Express,' the boy-hero very much still believes in Santa when the train shows up in front of his house. In the movie version, we see a young boy who's begun to seriously doubt the Santa stuff. The change is a good one, in that most of the audience, especially the adults, will be able to relate to this change in perspective about Santa Claus that comes with the coming of age. The visit of the train to this boy's house is more than just the start of an adventure, it is the beginning of a mission of redemption, even if that redemption is only one's faith in a Jolly Old Man. But that's why 'Polar Express,' first in book form and now a motion picture, works so very well. It' not really a story about Santa Claus at all, but about faith. The film drives home this message in a more heavy-handed way than the book does, but still without the preaching and condemnation that often comes from other Hollywood films that attempt to re-educate their audience. Polar Express works on a much, much deeper emotional and spiritual level than does 'The Incredibles,' and will fit in very well with those other Christmas classics that are really parables about faith, like 'The Miracle on 34th Street,' and 'It's A Wonderful Life.' And to a lesser extent, even 'A Christmas Story.' My seven-year old daughter, who saw both films with me, gave 'The Incredibles' a score of 9 out of 10. As we were walking out of the theater, I asked her if she liked 'Polar Express.' She told me 'Yes, I give it an eleven!' My review of 'Polar Express' is of the 2-D version that will be seen on most screens. I have every intention of going to see it again, but this time making use of the IMAX 3-D version. Roger Ebert (film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times) saw the film this way, and said it was the best 3-D experience he's ever had. I so wish the Polar Express would stop in front of my house this Christmas Eve. My rating: 11 out of 10.",10,2,4,15 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Answers the question: 'What if Ed Wood had CGI?'
","*** SPOILER ALERT! ***I've been a huge fan of the Star Wars saga since the original Star Wars hit the movie industry like a nuclear bomb.  I hold George Lucas in high regard, and am eternally thankful for what he's done for the sci-fi/fantasy genre. That being said, I find myself extremely disappointed with Lucus' latest creation, finding it almost painful to watch.  Easily the worst of all the Star Wars films, and certainly the worst love story ever to put to filmGOOD POINTS:VERY GOOD CASTING: This has been the strong suit of all the Star Wars films. The casting has never reached the level of 'perfect,' but Lucas has always done a fairly good job.   The only mistake made in this film was Hayden Christensen.   For some odd reason, Lucas is failing miserably to find someone capable of portraying the young Darth Vader/Anakin SkywalkerIMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES BY CGI CHARATERS: Jar Jar Binks has (thankfully) a much smaller role in AOTC, and is almost likable.  One almost feels sorry for him, as Palpatine easily makes use of Jar Jar's naivetÃ© to advance his own sinister plot.   One of the most impressive pieces of acting came from the CGI character Watto the junk dealer, as he meets Anakin for the first time in ten years.  You could actually feel that Watto was both happy and nervous seeing the young Jedi again.   You also got the feeling that Watto probably knew a great deal more about Shmi's fate then he was letting on to. The new and improved CGI Yoda was better than I thought possible, Frank Oz doing his usual outstanding voice over work.IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCES BY HUMANS: Despite have the worst script since 'Plan 9 from Outer Space,' there were several decent performances given by various actors throughout this movie.  My favorite is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku; a small part but very well done by Mr. Lee, whom seems to only get better with age.VERY GOOD TECHNICAL ASPECTS: For the most part, the camera work, costumes, editing, sound and other such stuff were very good.   Not many, if any mistakes made in that regard.BAD POINTS:REALLY BAD SCRIPT: Absolutely horrible, even by Star Wars standards.   The best writing was in the small parts, the major characters had absolute trash for lines.  You would think that a script that has been 25 YEARS IN THE MAKING could have at least been 'acceptable.'   However, it seems as if Lucas was going out of his way to find stupid gag lines and horrid clichÃ©s to fill out the dialogue.  It was so awful I found myself actually getting angry, and rewriting the movie in my head as I was watching it!TOO MANY REFERENCES TO 20TH CENTURY AMERICA: Not only was the script awful, it seemed as if it were written by the Democratic National Committee.  Far too many references to issues and artifacts from 20th century earth, especially late 20th century America.  The goofy reference to 'death sticks' in the sports-bar scene was completely uncalled for.   But even worst, the campaign finance reform talk coming out of Obi Wan's mouth made him sound like John McCain.   And  where did I ever here about a leader only being allowed to serve two terms because of the 'constitution?' I could go on and on, but you get the drift...THE WORST LOVE STORY PUT TO FILM: I'm not exaggerating: the 'romance' between Padme and Anakin is the absolute worst love story I've ever seen in any movie.  I literally cannot think of any film that portrayed romance in a more pitiful fashion.   It was painful to watch ANY scene between the two 'lovers,' no matter the setting.   I feel Anakin's pain, but for all the wrong reasons...CHRISTIAN HAYDEN IS A DISASTER: Even the 'foaming at the mouth' fans of Stars Wars, and fans of this film in particular, had some reservations concerning Mr. Hayden's performance.   Had he been given some good lines and decent direction, I'm certain the boy would have at least been marginal. But lacking something resembling a script, and some of the worst direction in the history of cinema, the poor boy seems more like a three year-old little brat rather than a 20 year old Jedi who has been given TEN YEARS of personal attention by Obi Wan.WAY TOO MUCH FORSHADOWING: It seemed like every ten minutes there was some sort of reference to the original Star Wars movie (Episode IV).   A few references would have been adequate, but Lucus over does it.   Some examples: the scene were Obi Wan cuts off the dude's arm in the bar; the 'Darth Vader' robes worn by Count Dooku; Meeting Owen Lars and his 'girlfriend' on Tatooine, not too mention the whole moisture farm, (though I liked that part), Tuscan raiders, R2D2 stopping the death of Padme by interfacing with the main computer; and on it goes...  Some reviewers complain about unfairly comparing this episode with the original Star Wars trilogy, but why shouldn't we since Lucas is constantly rubbing our faces in it throughout this whole film????HORRIBLE CONTINUITY PROBLEMS: Here's just one example: Anakin meeting that looks to be an Owen Lars on Tatooine that is at least his own age, or even older.   However, it's only been ten or eleven years since Anakin left Shmi, so how could he have a half-brother who's his own age?   Shouldn't Owen only be about nine years old, let alone have a girlfriend?I do hope Episode III is an improvement...overall, I rate this 5/10.My other Star Wars ratings:Star Wars (Episode IV) = 10/10The Empire Strikes Back = 10/10The Return of the Jedi = 7/10The Phantom Menace = 8/10",5,0,1,16 June 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," A Liberal Arts education is worthwhile after all...
","We are blessed to be living in an era where we have two fantastic trilogies which are not only fun to watch, but work on multiple different levels. These two movie franchises being `Lord of the Rings' and `The Matrix.' Unlike the hopelessly irrelevant `Star Wars' prequel trilogy, which tries so hard to be more than it is but ultimately seems rather forced; the LOTR and Matrix trilogies were designed from the ground up with an eye on the classics, theology and philosophy.  Both are far more messianic that the Star Wars prequel could ever hope to be, and both demonstrate how just one man (or one hobbit) can make all the difference in the world, quite literally.  We are still living and contemplating the lives and the legacies of such great men of peace like Buddha, Socrates and Jesus, all of who were just men (or perhaps a bit more than just mere `men') who had a better idea of just how life should be lived, and two of them, Socrates and Jesus, ultimately paid the highest price for their `radical' ideas.Now we have the final installment of the Matrix trilogy.  It does a good job of tying up all the loose ends, and throws in a few more twists just to keep things interesting.  Right up to the very end it is obvious that philosophy, theology and the classics are very much on the minds of the Wachowski brothers, as we watch them create a seamless garment out of three very different threads.  In the opening, we see that Neo is trapped in the world of the `Trainman,'  He's stuck at the Mobile Avenue subway station, waiting for his train to come in.  This station is a `halfway' point between the human world and the Matrix, a kind of purgatory without the flames.  We soon find out that the Trainman works for the Merovingian, and they both are very determined to keep Neo `waiting' at that station for a very, very long time.Thanks to a word from the Oracle (who else?) who is now in a new `shell,' Trinity and Morpheus set out to confront the Merovingian and get Neo back into the Matrix, so he can get back into his body!  From there, the story takes off, as we still have those pesky sentinels to deal with, who are getting ever closer to their goal of the complete destruction of Zion.Much like the second movie, the third is filled with a cast of secondary characters that makes for a truly delicious movie going experience.  We have some new characters: `the Trainman,' and a nice Indian family of programs Neo meets waiting for a train at the Mobile Avenue station.  There is an expanded role for Seraph, the guardian of the Oracle.  All of our favorites are back as well: the Oracle (in a new `shell'), Smith, Naobi, the Merovingian, Cornel West and so on.  Never have I seen a film so filled with so many interesting and memorable secondary characters.  Each so very unique and yet very likable --even Smith himself in his own quirky way.It's in this movie, as is obvious from the trailers, that we have the ultimate showdown between Neo and Smith.  But now we see each fully for what they are, and what their destiny is.  Smith is the incarnation of post-modernism, the quintessential nihilist, who sees no meaning or purpose in anything.  His only goal: to make everything over into his image-literally, and impose his idea of Utopia upon the entire Matrix, and the rest of the world as well.  It's this type of philosophy that gives us Nazi Germany and Maoist China: sameness is good, diversity bad.  Then we have Neo, the Zen Master Messiah, who refuses to jump into the tar pit of post-modern philosophical thought, but would much rather transcend it. He is the incarnation of faith, hope and love, `the virtue trinity,' embodied in one person.  One of these belief systems, Neo or Smith, has a viable, dynamic future, and one leads down the path to entropy and Big Brother.This film has a wonderful time mixing and matching pantheism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and various philosophical viewpoints and ideas.  The main characters of this movie are embodiments of these different worldviews, and one appreciates this trilogy so much more with the preunderstaning of these things in mind.  Do you need a thorough background in philosophy, theology and the classics to fully appreciate this film?  Yes, absolutely. If you don't, it will seem like so much intellectual nonsense with some good fight scenes and lots of automatic weaponry.It is obvious to me that the Wachowski Brother's appreciate and pay homage to Frank Herbert's excellent books `Dune' and `Dune Messiah' in Revolutions. IMHO, these two books are the best that science fiction has ever produced, and it seems as if the Wachowski brothers agree, as some of the major themes and plot ideas seem to have come these sources.  No, it's not a repeat of `Dune' in a mechanical, apocalyptic setting, but we do see some tremendous similarity in themes and ideas between the two.  Of course `Dune' is not the sole source of inspiration here, and in looking for dominating themes and ideas, one would have to come to the conclusion that comic books, anime, Christianity and Buddhism are major contributing factors, probably in that order.No movie is perfect, and `Matrix Revolution' has a few areas that could have been done better.  Yet, it is still so far beyond anything else out there that it's sins can easily be forgiven.  The LOTR is a close second, but in terms of overall production, the Matrix is far more interesting and imaginative.  One only has to compare the fight scenes between the two movies to see it.The Matrix Revolutions: 8/10",Null,0,0,10 November 2003

We soon find out that the Trainman works for the Merovingian, and they both are very determined to keep Neo `waiting' at that station for a very, very long time.Thanks to a word from the Oracle (who else?) who is now in a new `shell,' Trinity and Morpheus set out to confront the Merovingian and get Neo back into the Matrix, so he can get back into his body!  From there, the story takes off, as we still have those pesky sentinels to deal with, who are getting closer and closer to their goal of the complete destruction of Zion.
Much like the second movie, the third is filled with a cast of secondary characters that makes for a truly delicious movie going experience.  We have some new characters: `the Trainman;' and a nice Indian family of programs Neo meets waiting for a train at the Mobile Avenue station. There is an expanded role for Seraph, the guardian of the Oracle.  All of our favorites are back as well, the Oracle (in a new `shell'), Smith, Naobi, the Merovingian, Cornel West and so on.  Never have I seen a film so filled with so many interesting and memorable secondary characters.  Each so very unique and yet very likable --even Smith himself in his own quirky way.It's in this movie, as is obvious from the trailers, that we have the ultimate showdown between Neo and Smith.  But now we see each fully for what they are, and what their destiny is.  Smith is the incarnation of post-modernism, the quintessential nihilist, who sees no meaning or purpose in anything.  His only goal: to make everything over into his image--literally, and impose his idea of Utopia upon the entire Matrix, and the rest of the world as well.  It's this type of philosophy that gives us Nazi Germany and Maoist China: sameness is good, diversity bad.  Then we have Neo, the Zen Master Messiah, who refuses to jump into the tar pit of post-modern philosophical thought, but would much rather prefer to transcend it.  He is the incarnation of faith, hope and love; `the virtue trinity'; embodied in one person.  One of these belief systems, Neo or Smith, has a viable, dynamic future, and one leads down the path to entropy and Big Brother.This film has a wonderful time mixing and matching pantheism, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and various philosophical viewpoints and ideas.  The characters of this movie are embodiments of these different worldviews, and one appreciates this trilogy so much more with the preunderstaning of these things in mind.  Do you need a thorough background in philosophy, theology and the classics to fully appreciate this film?  Yes, absolutely.  If you don't, it will seem like so much intellectual nonsense with some good fight scenes and lots of automatic weaponry.It is obvious to me that the Wachowski Brothers appreciate and pay homage to Frank Herbert's excellent books `Dune' and `Dune Messiah' in Revolutions. IMHO, these two books are the best that science fiction has ever produced, and it seems as if the Wachowski brothers agree, as some of the major themes and plot ideas seem to have come these sources.  No, it's not a repeat of `Dune' in a mechanical, apocalyptic setting, but we do see some tremendous similarity in themes and ideas between the two.  Of course `Dune' is not the sole source of inspiration here, and in looking for dominating themes and ideas, one would have to come to the conclusion that comic books, anime, Christianity and Buddhism are major contributing factors, probably in that order.No movie is perfect, and `Matrix Revolution' has a few areas that could have been done better.  Yet, it is still so far beyond anything else out there that it's sins can easily be forgiven.  The LOTR is a close second, but in terms of overall production, the Matrix is far more interesting and imaginative.  One only has to compare the fight scenes between the two trilogies to see it.The Matrix Revolutions: 8/10 The Matrix Reloaded: 10/10 The Matrix: 10/10",Null,0,0,7 November 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Is this a Disney movie???
","Project 'Six-Two-Six' is deemed too dangerous by the 'Grand Council.'  A hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist 'Jumba,' (David Ogden Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished to a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his days. On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then escapes using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan girl named 'Lilo' (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and takes him home as her new pet dog, 'Stitch' (Chris Sanders).  Of course the Grand Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent 'Pleakley' (Kevin McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture experiment Six-Two-Six.And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a combination of 'Winnie-the-Pooh' and Saturday morning cartoons.  The dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's beloved 'Loony-Tunes.' Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for one, didn't miss them.)We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a 'dysfunctional' household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life without her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can appreciate.Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel they go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the 'talking dog,' and decides to take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis), and to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.
Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little monster, but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness in the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being 'nice' to Lilo was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch as the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect. Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba, is trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien. At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry for the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance he's longing for.I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly ('Toy Story,' 'Monsters Inc.').  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that comes from their computer animation partners.   'Lilo & Stitch' demonstrates that there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so famous many years ago. But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find yourself caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin d a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to keep social worker 'Mr. Bubbles' (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a foster home.There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as being entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft repeated phrase: 'Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind.'  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films 'Black Hawk Down' and 'We Were Soldiers,' but isn't something you often find in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, 'no one gets left behind,' has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text book. It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value, and that there is no such thing an 'expendable' person.    A better lesson for young children would be difficult to find.My rating: 10/10.",10,136,173,21 June 2002
The Incredibles," The best Pixar movie. Ever.
","The easiest '10' I've ever given a movie on IMDb. 'The Incredibles' lives up to it's name, and then someÂ…Here we have Bob Parr (a.k.a. 'Mr. Incredible') and his wife Helen (a.k.a. 'Elastigirl') trying to live a comfortable life in the suburbs having been forcibly retired from their work as super-heroes. The reason for their retirement? Too many lawsuits from collateral damage caused by their super-hero activities. (Only in AmericaÂ…)But Mr. Incredible just can't stay away from the hero business, and goes out saving people under the cover of 'bowling night.' He hates his job as an insurance claims agent, and just wants to go back to the fame, glamour and fun of super-herodom. When a mysterious woman finally gives him a chance to get back into action, Mr. Incredible jumps at the opportunity, and the fun of 'The Incredibles' only begins. Of all the movies in the Pixar stable, this one may be the most intelligent, best written and best realized since Toy Story. In some ways, it even surpasses it. The pacing, writing and visualization are all first-rate. Easily the best film of 2004, even with the likes of 'Kill Bill Volume 2' competing against it. No doubt this film will cater to a MUCH larger audience than Tarantino's recent masterpiece, and is actually much more fun to watch!The style hearkens back to the days of the late 60's, early 70's, with a huge dose of James Bond influence, and a bit of the 'Bat Man,' 'Jonny Quest' and 'Thunderbirds' TV shows thrown in. Of course many people have mentioned the Fantastic Four connection, which is very obvious, though the trials and tribulations of the Incredibles are unlike anything the FF crowd ever had to endure. But don't take my word for it, go see 'The Incredibles' for yourself, and enjoy the best treat that Hollywood has given us this year. My rating: 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,14 November 2004
Grave of the Fireflies," One of the finest films ever made.
","Occasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world.   `Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films.    No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one. 
It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's.    The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack, then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother, and the possible death of their father, a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser `Maya.'  (A US submarine torpedoed the `Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film.   In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14.  The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer Â– by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across.  I found myself already reaching for the tissues, and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in `Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see.  But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story.   Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera, we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister.   It's not a tale of romantic love, but one of `brotherly' love.  Seita loves his little sister, and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing, he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death.   Then, with typical Japanese seriousness, he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left.   Though not stated in the film, it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack.   No mother, no father, no home.   The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones, without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister, and shielded her from the horrors all around, especially the lack of food.  Films show us many things, some good, some evil, but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self.   Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister, but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion.   Who of us have always chosen the best path, the most perfect way of doing things?   Surely not I!   Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film. I use the word `convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature.   `Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely, even though his sister was a liability to his own survival.   I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding, but I ignored them in favor of `doing my own thing.'   How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help.   This film showed the evil in my own heart Â– something that I would not have noticed on my own.  But now that the blinders have been removed, I can repent of my selfishness, and look for ways to help others, instead of avoiding them. Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American.  But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film, there is no overt anti-American message.   In many ways, the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces!   Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon. It would be easy for someone from `the West' (i.e. the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception, rather than the rule.  They lived in very trying times, and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.   There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself.  There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China, India, Mongolia, and various other Asian nations.   We may not here about it on the news, or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better, if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko.      I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film.   I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together.   But most of all, I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life.",Null,369,387,7 December 1999
The Green Mile," King and Darabont are at it again...
","There's a wonderful line in the opening scene of the classic movie `All About Eve' given by George Sanders: `Minor awards are for such as the writer and director-since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it.'`The Green Mile' is one of those towers.   And what a wonderful tower it is, constructed by those two magic lantern architects Stephen King and Frank Darabont.  They were the responsible parties behind the majestic edifice of `The Shawshank Redemption.'  Stephen King, the chief architect of `The Green Mile,' seems to draw unction for his greatest writing from the Bible.  One of his most popular works, `The Stand,' is nothing more than a possible explanation for the book of Revelation.  Whether you believe that the book of Revelation is a true prophecy or not, one cannot honestly deny it's incredible ability to fire the human imagination unlike any other words put to paper during the past two millennia.  It is quite obvious Mr. King has once again has gone back to the Bible to gather kindling to light the fire known as `The Green Mile.'   But rather than John the Revelator's fantastic visions of future mayhem, he goes back to the beginning of the New Testament, and gathers his sticks amongst the rich woods of the four gospels.   Unlike Revelation, the four gospels are a straightforward telling of the life of Christ, as witnessed by many of his disciples.   These accounts are not meant to be, nor are they written as an allegory.   Hence, much room is left for later wordsmiths to describe the life of Jesus in more poetic terms.While one may either appreciate or hate `The Green Mile' without having ever read any of the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke & John; it is a far more interesting film when one watches it with the knowledge of the gospels in the forefront of one's mind.   The gospel paradigm is almost an essential filter to distill the essence of what King and Darabont are trying to say.    Though the main character is a prison guard played by Tom Hanks, the true story of this film concerns the fate of a giant black man named John Coffey, as played by Michael Clarke Duncan.   Here we have our messiah; falsely accused of a crime he did not commit, and sentenced to die for it.   Not only is he innocent, but much like Jesus himself, Coffey is blessed with the gifts of healing and prophecy.   (Careful viewers will find the Coffey character to have a demeanor very similar to Hank's Forrest Gump!)But what's an allegory of the life of Christ without a Pharisee to shout `crucify him!'   Mr. King does not disappoint in this regard, but supplies several Pharisees to counter the innocence found in John Coffey.   We have a perverted prison guard, Percy Wetmore, who seems to have sadomasochistic tendencies.   (He definitely being more of a sadistÂ…)  and a prisoner named `Wild Bill' who hints at being demon possessedÂ– by choice.   Not surprisingly, these two don't care much for the big African American messiah in there midst, and choose to torment rather than learn from him.One also needs disciples for a proper messianic tale, and these are supplied by the characters of the `good' prison guards, played by Tom Hanks & Co. They have wisdom enough not to judge their wards, but do there best to care for them until the final judgment of the state of Louisiana is carried out.  Having been in charge of violent men for several years, they quickly realize that John Coffey does not fit the profile of those who are routinely sent to their final resting place courtesy of `Old Sparky.'   This realization creates an unwanted dilemma, for how can one, in good conscious, put to death an innocent man for crimes he did not commit?  
Themes like these are not the talk of the local coffeehouses, but are critical to our advancement as moral agents.    If nothing else, I can salute King and Darabont for pushing this issue into the forefront of our lives, that we may, if only for a few hours, contemplate the seriousness and finality of capital punishment.   Those politically inclined have proclaimed that this film to be blatant criticism of capital punishment, but I don't see it that way.   Too me, this film goes beyond that issue, and forces us to think critically about our own lives, and our own need for a Savior. Frank Darabont, in his efforts to help construct this magnificent tower, shows just how much a film can impact us when a man with the proper temperament and talents is put to the task.   His direction is tight and his techniques are subtle.   He allows the story the room it needs, not cropping or chopping, as many would be tempted to do.   The pace of life in the Deep South is slow and steady, and Darabont does a marvelous job of capturing that feeling in the confines of an impatient medium.Stephen King did a fine job crafting the story the film is based upon, but leaves just a few too many loose ends that would have been best trimmed before publication.   There are certain actions and scenes that just don't make sense, and though they don't majorly detract from the main story, they do detract somewhat from our understanding of the film.   It's a bit distressing when I find myself rewriting a movie in my head while I'm watching it on the screen; and I admit doing it while watching `The Green Mile.'   There were a few scenes where I found myself saying, `If only he would have said `B' instead of `A' Â– what impact it would have had!'   It is my belief that had the script been just a bit more polished in places, this film would have been the rightful winner of `Best Picture' instead of `American Beauty.'",Null,0,0,24 April 2000
The Iron Giant," The BEST film of 1999
","I've just watched the DVD version of 'Iron Giant.'   I found the story line to be one of the most cliche' plots in all of animation.   There is an obvious anti-gun message that is rather silly and ineffective.   Then there's the all too familiar 'kid without a father' theme that Hollywood beats like a dead horse.    Hardly the sort of stuff that makes for a great film.   But, worst of all, it is filled with logical and factual errors that stretch the already thin credibility of animated flicks.Despite all that, I just loved this movie!Of all the films I've seen in 1999, this is definitely the best of the lot-- animated or live action.   And I say this just having seen 'Toy Story 2' a few weeks back, which is now my second favorite film of '99.  'Iron Giant' kicked it out of first place.   (You know it's a bad year for movies when your top two favorites are animations...)   Flaws and all, this film has more heart and emotion than any other 10 Hollywood films of 1999 combined.The film takes place during 1957.  We have a story about a boy named Hogarth (without a father, of course...) who finds a giant iron robot from outer space while searching the woods for invaders from Mars.   After being initially scared to death of the creature, he quickly realizes the robot is not out to harm him- and so, in short order, the boy befriends him.   The rest of the movie deals with the boy's efforts to hide a 100ft. tall robot from the local townspeople of Rockwell, Maine and the United States government.While there's nothing cliche' about a boy taking a walk in the woods and discovering a huge metallic robot suffering from amnesia munching on the local electric power plant, the '...boy meets awesomely powerful yet benign creature and quickly befriends him while everyone else wants to kill him...' plot has been done too many times to count.    Yet the film's writers, directors and animators take us down this well-traveled path in such a way that new life is breathed into this most ancient of fairy tales.   For that feat alone, the movie is deserves every drop of praise it gets.The film is a parable of the atomic age.   The fears and paranoias of the time are summed up in the government agent sent out to find the giant robot, 'Kent Mansly.'   He's a walking, talking tribute to the 'red under every bed' mindset.    The innocent and fun loving target of his paranoia, the boy Hogarth, contrasts Mansly.   Hogarth is about the best portrayal of a red blooded 50's era American boy that's ever been put to screen, despite the fact that he's a simple drawing.'Iron Giant' should not be mistaken for a mere kid's flick.    Parents will like it as much if not more than their children.   The message of the film is one of love and self-sacrifice, the kind of thing most of us want to instill in our kids.  In it's own way, 'Iron Giant' is a kind of 'Saving Private Ryan' for children.Ultimately, this is a love story between a boy and his robot.   Yes, it sounds silly, but you'll have to see it yourself to understand how the writers & directors pull it off.  There is a moral to this film, or I should say, 'morals.'  The morals are not heavy handed or preached, but they are expounded upon by the actions of the characters themselves.   My favorite lesson had to do with  'peace through superior fire power!'But don't take my word for how good it is. My four-year-old son watched the DVD three times in a 24-hour period, and watched it every day we had it for the seven-day rental period.  I believe it's now his new favorite film.  We judge how much he likes a film by the amount of times he asks to see it again.    The last movie he wanted to watch as much as this one is 'A Bug's Life.'Interesting note: 'Iron Giant,' along with 'Toy Story 2,' both pay homage to good old 'Sputnik' -the first ever satellite launched into earth's orbit. It's neat how these two rather unrelated stories both deal with the significance of that event.Don't bother renting this film.   Just buy it the next time you see it on sale.   We've already decided to make the 'Iron Giant' DVD a permanent part of our collection.",10,0,0,27 December 1999
The Matrix," A Review of the Matrix from a Christian perspective...
","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!I finally watched 'The Matrix' on DVD  -- I give it a solid 8 out of 10.This movie is a heck of a lot a fun!   Let's face it, the most appealing things about this film were the awesome fight scenes, the shameless glorification of automatic weapons, the black leather, and Carrie-Ann Moss.
So far I haven't seen many films in 1999 with a particularly outstanding performance by an actor, save Richard Farnsworth in 'The Straight Story.' But Mr. Fishburne would certainly get my vote for best performance!   I can't possible imagine anyone else better in that role.   He played it to perfection.   And Hugo Weaving's performance as `Agent Smith' was absolutely brilliant.However, I did find some faults with this film; the main one being the recycling of the most clichÃ©' of science fiction plot lines, the 'messiah-deliver who was prophesied to free us all...blah, blah, blah....'   Now that it's been done 14,000 times over, I think it's clearly time to finally lay that plot line to rest.... Also, the film was way too upbeat concerning the superiority of humans vs. machines.    Everyone knows machines are better.  (Speaking of clichÃ©s', how many times has the conflict of man vs. machine been explored in film-literally history?   About 50 million times???  Puh-lease....)
Warner Brothers should have forced the Wachowski Brothers to include an apology to the makers of `Dark City' and `Terminator 2' in the opening credits.   (Not to mention `Dune,' `Metropolis,' H.G. Wells, and Stanley KubrickÂ….)And to be perfectly honest, that guy who made a deal with the agents to be put back into the 'matrix' was the only intelligent one of the bunch.  (Say, isn't that `Guido, the Killer Pimp?')  He knew a good thing when he saw it.  Too bad he was such a jerk.   (Philosophical note: If the dude asks to have his memories completely erased before taking on his new identity, then how does that differ from him just putting a bullet to his head and ending it right then and there????  Isn't the exact same thing accomplished?   OK class, who'd like to answer that one?)Besides all those negatives, this was the best martial arts film I've ever seen.  Jackie Chan finally has some competition.And yes, the agent's line about the failed 'Utopia' matrix was very interesting; but if you think about it, it makes absolutely no sense.    The best way to keep a human being enslaved is to play off their 'appetites' for food and sex.   Just keep giving them enough to want more, but never enough to reach complete satisfaction.   Those in the drug, porno, and entertainment industries know all about human enslavement.  
It's not that a Utopian society would have failed because everyone would have considered it to be a fake, they'd be too busy satisfying the cravings of their flesh to notice.... but a Utopian Matrix would fail because of the evil, sinful nature of human beings.   Man is just too selfish to be able to create a successful Utopia here on earth, or even in a computer simulation.
That's why 'Forbidden Planet' is such a classic movie.   It shows that even when a society has everything it could possible want, there's no way to eliminate the wildcard of the 'id' or sinful nature of man.   (Or, in the case of 'Forbidden Planet,' the sinful nature of Krell....)   It was the Krell's inability to check their 'dark side' that caused the destruction of their society.  So the A.I. machines built a world where humans could indulge their evil nature, a world identical to the one we currently live in. I liked the whole concept of the realization that the world around us is not all there is to reality.   On that point, the film scores some major bonus points in my book.Truth is the world that we see, feel, touch and smell everyday of our lives is a 'matrix' of sorts.   Yet you won't find a bunch of amoral A.I. robots behind the curtain running the whole show, no matter how hard you look. Rather, our world is run by a rather benevolent spirit whom most like to refer to as God.   He has sent many prophets, and even his own son to let us in on the secret, much like Morpheus acts as a prophet in this film, letting Neo and others in on the secret that is the Matrix.And much like Neo, God offers us the choice of the red and blue pills. Either we can throw our lot in with him, or continue on in our quaint little deception that what we taste, see, feel & hear are the only things that are 'out there,' nothing more.Throughout the course of human history, we have various examples of individuals who decided that the blue pill was for them: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, Fruede, Nietzsche, T.H. Huxley; to name a few.   All of them devout atheists.   All of them believing all there is to this world is what their senses dictated to them, nothing more.   Then there are those who took the blue pill, like Mother Teresa, the Pope, Billy Graham, Albert Shcwietzer, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.S. Bach. All of them believers in a spiritual world more real than the world around us.   All of them committed, in their own way, of proclaiming this great truth to any that would listen.   As for me, I took the blue pill and threw my lot in with the benevolent higher power.   I don't regret it for a minute.",Null,0,0,22 January 2000
Gladiator," I've seen this movie before...
","It seems as if the folks at DreamWorks could not decide whether they wanted to remake 'Ben Hur,' 'Spartacus,' or 'The Fall of the Roman Empire,' so they decided to remake all three.  They took two awesome scripts and one mediocre screen play, stuck them in a blender, and the resulting concoction has become the better-than-average 'Gladiator.'  It borrows most heavily from the mediocre 'Fall of the Roman Empire' in terms of characters and basic plot, but quite a bit of influence from 'Ben Hur' and 'Spartacus' can easily be noted.This is the story of Mad Maximus (Russell Crowe), an Australian who moves to Spain, looks good in a toga and so becomes general of the Roman army. Unfortunately, he refuses to kiss the behind of emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), because he's a bit upset that Commodus killed his own father and Max's best friend Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  One bad thing leads to another, and old Mad Max finds himself mixed up with an international cast of characters fighting as gladiators in the Peoria of North Africa.  Soon the day of their big break comes, and it's out of Peoria and on to the Hollywood and Broadway of the ancient world: Rome; to play games of life in death before tremendous crowds at the biggest theater in the world: the Coliseum.Many find the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome to be rather savage and brutal; but you have to give the Romans a break, in that Hollywood, video games and ice hockey had not yet been invented.  What else is there to do for entertainment other than watch a bunch of strangers poke and stab each other with sharp objects?  Sure, Playstation II has better blood & gore graphics, but several centuries of technological advancement will do that for you.  In the old days, the blood and gore of the arena was all that was available.But an interesting twist develops in the plot: Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) finally realizes after thirty years that her brother is a sick, unrepentant pervert and lunatic.  Some are slow learners.  So she decides that the ol' gladiator/general Mad Max might be just the guy to help her submarine her bro, and restore peace, justice and the American Way to Rome.Anyone who has seen 'Ben Hur,' 'Spartacus' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' has already seen this movie.  There's no surprises or suspense, just lots more scenes of people being decapitated and/or disemboweled.  It's amazing what special effects artists and CGI have been able to do to help bring brutality into a far more realistic light than in the past --chalk up another great moment for Hollywood.In the hands of most directors, a film like this would be the scorn and bird droppings of most film critics.  But DreamWorks had an ace up their sleeve: they got Ridley Scott to direct this train wreck of a script, and then work his incredible magic to make the ugly duckling transform into a beautiful swan.  Well Ridley is good, but he's not God, so what we end up with is a swan who's kinda cute, but not quite up to the cover of Sport Illustrated's swimsuit issue.   Still, this is far more than most could have done with such muck.Ridley Scott is one of the few directors who the word 'genius' sticks to like glue.  You've seen what this guy can do, and do better than most anyone else.  For the movie 'Gladiator', Scot goes all out.  He gets the BEST actors, the best set and costume designers, and the best composer, then puts it all together and creates a tremendous feast for the eyes & ears.  There are many great performances all throughout this picture, and the camera work and art direction are absolutely top notch.If there is a complaint, it is with the fight sequences.  They are the typical fast cut/shakey camera mish mash that's been going on for ages. One minute a group of guys are facing one another, the next minute a whole bunch of them are dead.  How did it happen?  Who knows, who cares.  Instead of carefully staged shots and fluid camera work, we get the cinema equivalent of projectile vomit.  Oh well, at least I can always put on 'Crouching Tiger' or 'Phantom Menace' if I want to see sword play done properly, or the Tyrone Power version of 'Zorro' (1940).  But I will admit that the battle scene between the Germans and the Romans at the very beginning of the film was extremely well done.  The fast cuts and bouncy camera did an excellent job conveying the excitement and confusion that is prevalent in large scale combat.The actors and the performances they give are far too good for a film of such tripe.  Of particular note is the performance of Lucilla by Connie Nielsen.  The film is worth the price of admission (or the price of the DVD) just to see this woman's face light up the screen and give the over used theme of blood vengeance such dignity, poise and grace.  Lucilla is by far the most interesting character of the film, for she is the only one who goes through a process of transformation by means reflection and examination, rather than by forced external entanglements.  The characters of Commodus and Maximus could have been easily played by cardboard cut-outs with the words 'Bad Guy' and 'Good Guy' stenciled on each.  What you see of Commodus and Maximus in the first ten seconds of film is what you see in their final scenes, there is no change or awakening in these two guys.  But Lucilla rewards us with an interesting sort of redemption that makes a rather predictable film worth watching.  As Ridley Scott himself said of Ms. Nielsen: 'She can rule my empire anytime.'My generous rating: 7/10",7,0,1,6 August 2002
