The Blair Witch Project," The best movie ever ...
","This movie is perfect ... not a formula film, made very ingeniously, with a hand-held camera and an older type of camera, expertly made ... I am reaching now, because after seeing it for the first time, I am speechless... if this movie doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award, and if it is nominated, if it doesn't win, then that is solid proof that there is something wrong with the industry ... this is an all-time classic!",10,1,2,8 August 1999
