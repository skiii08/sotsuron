Hereditary," Descent would have been a better name!
","What an overrated piece of mediocre filmmaking. The story is probably best described as 'gender bender from hell': A demon who demands a male host from his earthly followers gets a female one instead (things Steve Martin used to rave about in the 80's) and, as a result, all hell breaks loose. The main character to whom this is supposed to happen learns about his fate only in the last minute - and so does the audience. Far too late for anyone to care. The rest of the movie, 126 minutes, if I counted correctly (and I did count more than once), was basically proof that first-time feature filmmakers should not be allowed to use a narrative device as powerful as unreliable narration. How on earth critics could come up with the idea that this is a masterpiece is literally beyond me. Maybe they too were cult members?",3,5,9,1 June 2019
