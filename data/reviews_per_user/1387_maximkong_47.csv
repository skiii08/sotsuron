The King's Speech," Slightly off-balance - too much focus on therapist caused a lack of emphasis on the immediate royal family members
","A very solid movie, with Colin Firth's amazing performance made me believe he should win the award for his portrayal of a king battling against issues of self-confidence and shortcomings. I liked the usage of camera angle shot close to the face which augments the nervous feeling or reluctance every time the King was expected to deliver a speech. The only thing I would like to see more is a little bit more involvement of his family (especially his wife) as I thought the pace was a little too slow -- the screen time on the sessions between the King and his speech therapist could have been reduced slightly to give way to more emphasis on his family's thoughts.",7,1,3,18 November 2012
Moneyball," Some minus points for deviating from reality?
","Terrific script and a movie packed with top-notch acting performances and life lessons that are able to keep anyone engaged whether you know baseball or not.Like any other better sports movie out there, Moneyball gave a lot of insight on the ups and downs of the dog-eat-dog world of pro sports accompanied with hidden themes of persistence & courage to go against all odds (or to defy reality) to achieve success. Unlike most other sports movies, but similar to The Wrestler, Moneyball is not made to overglorify sportsmanship and showed that things do not end up in your way all the time.However, knowing that the same people who was behind 'Social Network' -- a movie that disappointed me -- was involved in this, I had to be skeptical on how accurate Moneyball portray the real people behind these characters. (NOTE: the movie claims to be based on true story, IT DID NOT HIGHLIGHT that it is based on the novel or other material) Like Social Network, I noticed immediately many things in the movie are quite dramatic, which is not a good thing if that causes it to stray too far from reality. For example, the real Billy Beane did not wore those fashionable attire or tracksuit (as done by Pitt) but look more like stolen from his stats assistant's wardrobe instead. Whatever... I have decided to let my final ratings be determined by how the actual people themselves felt about the movie. A quick browse online, I found Billy was satisfied with his character in the movie, Art Howe was offended, Scott Hatteberg did mentioned some things were incorrect in the movie, and I do not know if the sabermetrics guy felt okay with it. Hence, 7 stars is a good compromise from what looks like a 8-9 star at my first glance.",7,1,1,18 November 2012
Black Swan," As eerily beautiful as a black swan
","Aronofsky has not lost his touch, since the days of 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'The Wrestler'. BLACK SWAN is, like Wrestler, one hell of a movie featuring the ups and downs of a person in an arts career.I like the fact that this was different to the natural approach of The Wrestler in that it incorporated fictional inner demons into Portman's character to represent the low parts of her ballet life. Cinematography and editing were excellent. But the awesome part of this movie would not have existed without Portman's breathtaking performance as a fragile, controlled girl who was slowly but intensely getting caught up by the stress and the 'black swan' within herself, all in the name of 'letting go'.I have not seen all the nominees yet, but would be damn surprised if Natalie did not win the Oscar for her phenomenal role. Interesting to note that the Black Swan's first physical appearance was when she stole the lipstick And her mother is probably as crazy as her too",9,2,4,18 November 2012
Captain Phillips," A Fine Film Doing its Best to Stick Close to Reality, but not a Wholesome One
","When it comes to films premised on true events, a key priority in my ratings would be how close the film is able to convey what has happened in the real-life accounts. I have studied various accounts - testimony of Capt Philips, the director, the disatisfied crewman and the sole survivor of the Somali pirate group - I think the film has done its best to compress a 5-day ordeal into a two-hour movie and remained focused on the essence of the story, despite dramaticizing certain events.To me, the true magic of Captain Philips lies in Tom Hank's acting performance of despair and trauma during the final 30-minutes of the movie. The performance from the Somali supporting actors was another surprise to me, even though I can sense some hints of stereotyping.Tom Hank's version of Captain Philips was too talkative (as a hostage), making the Somali looked like they were easy targets for manipulation. Like other American-military theme based films, Captain Philips is still a victim of romanticizing the American glory, as the balance was being overly skewed towards the perception of the Americans (especially from a talkative Tom Hanks). It was reported that the Somali survivor's accounts was not captured in this movie. I think the film would have been more realistic if it was made in a slightly different feel, allowing the pirates more room to express their intentions and/ or how they feel about their actions.My biggest disappointment of all was that the movie does not fulfil one criteria to be having >8/10 rating - it is not wholesome. I am not talking about the fact that it ignored the accounts of some other crew members, or the account of the Somali pirates. I was referring to how the film doesn't do enough to fit into the bigger picture. Although both factors would help make the film better, I understand the limitations this film had. Captain Philips was one of the most dramatic newsflow (that involves just an individual, essentially) since the Obama administration. It was portrayed in the movie (which did happened in real life) that a dozen of SEAL guys and a big US Navy warship were up against a small lifeboat of 4 Somali pirates. What happens to the other ships captured by other pirates that probably summed up to 200 crews as hostages? It was reported by NY Times that 'Every country will be treated the way it treats us,' Abdullahi Lami, one of the pirates holding a Greek ship anchored in the pirate den of Gaan, a central Somali town, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in a telephone interview. 'In the future, America will be the one mourning and crying.' Honestly, the movie could have dedicated 10-20 minutes for that.",6,0,3,29 December 2013
Sucker Punch," Unexpectedly, it is as good as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!
","It's rare to see another film of this genre (i.e. of action and pretty chicks) that qualifies to be listed in my movie/ favourites list.Aside from its amazing graphics, the storyline and the way it is being carried out are consistent/on par with the best of very serious, thought-provoking movies. The negative ratings given to this movie were there because I believe the viewers did not understand the movie, which should be watched through a difference looking glass.Anyone who paid attention to the plot and appreciate the purpose of the role of the dreams will realize that it did not need to be a full-blown sentimentalism, emotional trainwreck/depressing storyline and SuckerPunch does not intend to present complicated character developments as expected of 'real, serious movies' because it is not made that way.There is no need for the actors to deeply colour the message with dramatic emotional acting performances. There are already tons of realistic psychological movies dealing with similar subjects very heavily, a fine example would be One flew over the cuckoo's Nest.This is a story on people struggling to make things easier by escaping from reality. This is a story that intends to be purely focused on the characters' STATE OF MIND, and nothing else externally. The alternate realities themselves fulfil all those purposes; the realistic expectations that I would very much expect from a well-made thought-provoking film are also present in this one, but in a different way. This is a modern-version of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, influenced by the structure of graphic novels and in particular, Japanese-manga style of storytelling. I am really stunned by Snyder's decision to present such an unorthodox ending which actually made me really happy to include this movie in my list. Such ending will definitely put many people off.I did not expect it to be a tearjerker too. Such a movie, if we ignore the fact that the actors are Westerners, is fundamentally a serious Japanese anime/manga material because the structure and especially the storyline is made akin to it. The only flaw I would like to point out is that the plot is not sustainable enough to maintain its suspense towards the middle-end part of the story. The battle scenes on the train fell short of expectations as compared to the previous 'dreams'. It is not a flaw in terms of plot, but it is the CGI technical aspects that failed to catch up to the plot's demands. Fortunately towards the ending, no more CGI was necessary.",9,2,4,18 November 2012
Citizen Kane," Weaknesses in its Plot Fail to Impress
","i understand why this movie is considered as the forefather of the cinematographic techniques and movie-making used nowadays, and how phenomenal it must have been during its time ( and still is among many to be considered among the top movies of all time) However few things are certain in my point of view: cinematography breakthrough does not qualify a movie to be better than others, lavish props and good acting performances by unknown cast does not make one movie great either...the fundamental issue with citizen kane, despite all of that, is that this movie is still disturbingly normal as any other, however new or old -- with plot and character development so uninspiring, conventional and at times predictable (how many times a story of a rich tycoon's demise has been recycled?) -- and hence fail to impress. Best movie of all time? Far from it in my list. Citizen Kane only appears to me as having great outer beauty but lacking the brains to carve out inner impression. In fact there are other classic movies i can think of which are much more memorable than this one, and there are very recent movies with equally phenomenal cinematographic breakthroughs and yet superior in the sense of the inner beauty as compared to citizen kane.",6,3,9,23 November 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Nearly Unforgettable Juxtapose of WWII
","I will never figure out how much I would actually rate on this film. But just speaking in terms of sheer entertainment value, it is an awesome watch and a truly unique style to it akin to an unforgettable cult experience and additional masterpiece in the rest of cinematic history. This of course was supported by amazing performances by the cast members who were 'cool' but convincing in their roles, and the music score accompanying the movie's sarcastic humour throughout the whole duration.Of course, one has to be aware that this movie is like a juxtapose of the real WWII situation and evaluations standards in terms of how realistic the film is to the real war has to be toned down.",8,1,4,23 November 2012
The Impossible," Can't Help it but Felt Inadequate
","Based on the fact that the actual family behind the movie was a huge supporter throughout the whole shooting process, and the fact that they actually went back to the original locations in Thailand to shoot the movie, I think the director and his team tried hard to make it as realistic as possible. The CGI was quite well-crafted.Maria Belon herself already said the movie is accurate Maria Belon (the real mother) in an interview responded to a question on what she thinks the movie will mean to people. She said it is not about that it was a story on another person, but it is a story that people can connect with even though they had not seen a tsunami. She stressed that it is part of a struggle of life, that everyone can recognize and relate to.Sadly, I do not think that this movie did enough to accomplish the things she said. Even after all the scenes of being trapped in the water and the sense of not knowing whether your loved ones survived, I still felt empty from the movie. There are scenes where it would have made more sense to conserve energy but the main leads wasted them with unnecessary melodrama. Dialogues were limited, understandably because people at times do not know or do not want to say anything under that level of trauma...but the director could have allocated more scenes/ more body language/ involve more people at the correct times, to make up for the disconnect.I do not believe Naomi Watts did a good job portraying Maria Belon. When I watched Maria's interview, my impression that she was a strong woman and the type that would put rationality above emotions. She was not afraid to re-watch the movie on sufferings that she herself endured, but she felt pain when she watch the sufferings OTHERS endured. I do not understand why Naomi, who have had many conversations with Maria, failed to recognize Maria's strong personality but instead portrayed her crying too often (not when she was crying in physical pain but there were many scenes where she was crying for the sake of crying). Of course I knew she was aware at that time of the things she may have lost and that she was in between life and death. But her eldest son was with her all the time and common sense would say she was needed to be strong! Naomi did a wonderful job portraying a mother thinking about her children no doubt. But not a wonderful job portraying a woman strong at heart. Maria did said she nearly gave up at the end, but Naomi looked to me as already given up somewhere in the middle.",5,2,8,17 May 2013
Argo," Perhaps better if it treats sensitive elements at national-level more seriously
","This was a pretty good film, with a solid material as a base and I was also pleasantly surprised with Ben Affleck accomplishing so much as a director. However, it didn't quite work out 'great' for me. Many reviews and wikipedia statements took great efforts to point out the historical inaccuracies and hence I am not going to comment on that.What I would highlight was that the movie should have treated certain elements that were politically sensitive on a national-level more seriously. If you are going to talk about another nation's role on a real event, it is not right to twist the facts to the point of near-defamation, and it does not make business sense either because what will the viewers of the affected nations think about your movie? Just one sentence spoken in this movie has offended the UK and Canada in that respect.A worse crime was committed towards the nation where the incident happened, which also made me disappointed. The whole movie was quite alike the cliché that you expect from this type of genre, including dumbing down the villains' intelligence. However, I did not like the way this movie has made the whole country (not just the rebels) looked one-dimensional in character and behaviour, almost barbaric-like in a way. I was also ticked off by the unwanted dramatic car chase scene at the airport. I know this movie is not a documentary and it should be allowed to add some drama flavours if it wishes, but Ben should have been more creative to generate the 'drama' instead of recycling 'angry mobs' and 'fanatic military officials' over and over again. Also, I wish that the movie make more room to focus on several more aspects, like shedding a little more light on the Canadian guy and what ultimately happens to those hostages who were trapped in the embassy.",5,3,6,5 January 2013
12 Angry Men," Brilliant for an Old Film!
","This is a very unique and engaging film that takes place in just a single room. The discussions on a guilty charge is built upon with enough materials and suspense elements to cover the whole 1.5 hours without any need for the change of scenes or characters or any other plot twist techniques. And a brilliant masterpiece indeed! It is certainly not an easy task to make a movie like that with the same fixed setting. Probably this movie is smart enough to make up the number of characters to at least 12 men to make up for the rich details. But really, what other faults can you find in this movie with a perfect script taking place in one room for the whole time? What other flaws? I can't spot any.",9,1,2,24 November 2012
The Secret in Their Eyes," Blending all forms of elements really well!
","I have commended on films that seem flawless and remarkable before. Never have I imagine a film that would actually bring these achievements into a whole new level, until El Secreto de Sus Ojos came along. From the aspect of its cinematography, every single detail was being paid upon intrinsic attention to the utmost; fitting camera angles and timing, maximizing the whole emotional and environmental expression. The acting performances, particularly Irene's, are another wonder to behold. Not to mention, it accomplished some of the most original yet beautifully memorable shots, i.e. the chase scene, the court scene (one of the best crime-solving feat i have seen in a while). The ending: one of the best I have seen in a long long while; a blend of the ultimate plot twist and a happy moment. From romance, comedy, crime, noir, thriller, reminiscence, suspense, plot twists and development, sentimentalism, cinematography, retribution, etc....This film is a powerful blend of each said elements. If some of most amazing films can be compared to drugs, this film is the ultimate blend of all drugs. And my first sincere salutation to the Oscars for choosing the right winner this time. (Prior to this, I actually bet on white ribbon/un prophet to win which are also top-notch films)",Null,4,5,18 November 2012
127 Hours," Should rely less on flashbacks and focus more on the present survival skills
","I do not know how accurate this film is to the actual case, but it has done a good job to cover as much as possible portraying a realistic simulation of such incident. However the film could have done more to reveal certain things -- like how does he poop, how does he stay clean and, how does he not grow his facial hair etc... I am pretty sure the director or screenwriter should know the answers to these issues when they have done enough research and interview on the actual victim himself. It is not an excuse to avoid displaying these survival skills which could have been far more interesting than the too many flashbacks that were being usedCinematography is unique and Franco did well to carry out probably one of his first main roles in a film.People will certainly remember this film for a long time for its particularly outstanding climax scene.",6,1,3,18 November 2012
500 Days of Summer," Unsweetened (No Sugar Coating); The Most Honest Romantic Movie in my Opinion
","500 days of summer is probably the first in a romantic genre to earn a near-perfect score in my favourite list. It has the perfect, unconventional and almost totally un-clichéd method of telling a love story, which by the way is perhaps the most truthful description of the complexities surrounding relationships with a high failure probability in the end.I also truly salute some of the statements made in this movie -- some examples being the blame on the materialistic nature of the modern world for casting a plastic veil on the integrity of love and why fate is not what it is -- they were so boldly made because they are definite taboos to be mentioned in other romantic movies! Not to mention the ending is probably one of the best i have seen in years! Well, to fall in love with a movie that shows love does not always win but it is not an emotional sore loser either, as one moves on with life from the experience as a better person. Perhaps I may be among the rare breed that feels this is the most honest romantic movie yet.",9,1,1,23 November 2012
Midnight in Paris," Wonderfully more boring and worse than Tree Of Life!
","An Oscar nominee that appears even more boring than Tree of Life does not deserve high rating from me, let alone deserving the nomination in the first place.I get the whole purpose of the writing, but the execution is entirely flawed and I don't feel any genuine intentions or chemistry out of the characters, regardless of whether they are real or 'illusions', You can see that the actors are 'acting' instead of flowing naturally along with that demanded from their characters. To say that everything happens that way because it is just a dream is not a good excuse. Shame, really. If it were not for that my ratings would have been probably much higher.",1,4,10,18 November 2012
The Flowers of War," Touching moments failed to save the lack of realistic elements
","First of all, amongst the many Zhang Yimou films I have seen in recent years, those of which were heavily formulated with stereotypical Chinese-style overacting drama/action and bombastic soap opera emotions, or governed by mundane slow pace which did not quite fit into the scenes realistically, Flowers of War is surprisingly free of most of that and I enjoyed the distinctly more natural acting performances here.However, what disappointed me was that the director chose to splash too much on the melodrama but fail to amend several obvious flaws that seriously defy the logic of some of these characters' actions. For instance (SPOILER ALERT), unless he intends to be a thief belongings of the dead, I don't see why a foreigner who obviously has no attachments to Nanking (judging from his poor command of Chinese) would choose to go all the way at the start of the movie for a job which any sensible man would know that its not worth taking. And why, if they plan to sneak out to avoid the soldiers, would they dress up in noticeable cheongsam? Do they not value their lives over the joy of making loud noises on a childish girl fight that will easily make the soldiers notice? What is with 'educated' Japanese high ranking officers who bothered to play some random piano and never question whatever that has happened to his befallen soldiers? Survival issues on lack of food, water, hygiene and the paranoid feeling that affects the group morality, were nonexistent and that to me is another serious flaw.There are several other flaws i am not going to mention, just disappointed that the Chinese themselves have ample opportunities to make something personal to the nation but the work was sub-par standard in the end.",5,5,11,18 November 2012
Shutter Island," Unfortunately, Gave Away Too Many Hints at the Start
","The world would be stupid if this movie is to be considered a very good psychological thriller/ twister. Come on, there are so many better ones.Let's compare this with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (about the same time), though not exactly categorized as a psychological thriller but similar to Shutter Island, relies heavily on the suspense/twist factor to win the crowd. Inglorious Basterds was successful in that regard, as I was not able to predict the next outcome because the sequence of events happened in an almost random manner; even if someone can predict it, he would find it difficult to catch up to the quick pace of the movie.Shutter Island, regrettably, gave off TOO MANY HINTS from the very beginning. I, at the very least, already foresee the truth during the 1st quarter of the movie. I know this is based on a novel, but Shutter Island's ending lacks the kick that Inglorious Basterds had, probably because the desired effect is sure to be tuned down once you figured out what was going on. If i were to edit this movie, I could easily remove certain 'spoiler elements', like firing Michelle Williams for example, and Shutter island would be a whole lot better. Fortunately, the abundant amount of twists (thanks to the convenient use of hallucinations) kept me watching even when I already knew what is going to happen.",5,3,6,18 November 2012
Life of Pi," Surprised at Lee's attention to detail; Unfortunately, the tiger is still 'crouching', and the dragon/potential still 'hidden'
","I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive effort carried out by Ang Lee to keep the movie as faithful to the book as possible. The setting (a mixed infrastructure landscape in India , culture, and the animal environment) I believe were correctly chosen and helped to blend in the scenes to be as natural as possible. The animation, is possibly one of the most accurate and realistic depiction of animal behaviour that I have seen in a movie, despite being CGI. Truly an Oscar-deserving achievement and a new high benchmark has been set for future CG animations out there. Kudos to this effort as the non-human characters are part of the essential recipe to bring out the best from this movie. The Indian actors did very well in their roles, many of them are actually well-known actors but I am not excluding the main actor (a newbie I believe) who was adequately into his character throughout the whole movie.However, I have to be serious when I said that the movie was only adequate. Reasons being: - 1. The potential, I am afraid, was not utilised to the maximum. Many of the subjects and issues being brought up are massively complicated...While the movie did a good job in the first half of the movie, towards the second half the effect has tapered substantially due to too many unnecessary CG effects. I am not referring to the effects that contribute to the novel's intention. For instance, a prolonged scene of the lifeboat being unrealistically tossed around the ocean and nearly ramming into the sinking ship, like a mini toyboat, is best taken out of the movie as it left behind a lot of doubtful impression in my opinion.2. Rebalancing is needed. This is the most critical flaw in my opinion when comparing Life of Pi versus some of the best movies within the same genre. Some of the CG effects (excluding the animals) were not only unnecessary but took far too long, and sadly did not help to build up progress in the hidden message this movie is trying to deliver fundamentally. The movie was disappointing in this way because some of the things that has happened, they did not need to be elaborated extensively in order for the audience to comprehend. A slow pace is okay, but the main culprit lies in the extra screen-time just for the sake of special effects, other important details that could have been highlighted were sadly sacrificed. Really a rebalancing of CG effects vs critical points in the flow of plot is needed. 3. In fact, narration should be given a stronger role. Life of Pi was initiated with the narration from the older Pi, I don't see why it would not be feasible to input some narration to hear the young Pi's thought during his ordeal (and yes I know what happened during the ending). I did not read the novel, but I had the chance to glance through parts of it and recall that the novel focuses a lot on its inner thoughts rather than the surrounding effects. No matter how good CGI can do, it cannot capture small details that can be crucial to the plot and that is where this movie needs to rely on more than one medium to bring it to new heights. 4. Again, the main actor's performance as Pi was only adequate. Although it is unfair to scrutinize his attempts given that he had to portray Pi through probably more than half of the movie, when anyone is under such an ordeal (for the sake of survival) I would expect something more complicated or changes in his character behaviour. Especially given the ending which offered the audience a full picture of what was going on. This is probably a fault that should be attributed towards the imperfect direction of Ang Lee. For instance, he has illogically displayed too much energy during times when he was supposed to be conserving energy, seemed to be unaffected by hypothermia and other physical deterioration (especially when he was swept into the cold ocean several times in the mid of night) and he has illogically presented himself as too calm a person at times, given that he was a unique teenager character under severe physical and mental trauma.5. Anyone can tell me if 'you are able to find god after hearing my story' has serve its purpose? It did not, for me.All in, this movie is a worthy Oscar contender, especially for CG effects, but unfortunately, the tiger is still 'crouching', and the dragon/potential still 'hidden'",5,4,22,1 December 2012
Man of Steel," Probably the first superhero movie that takes glory in the mass genocide of human lives!!
","4/10 as the cons outweigh the prosI am quite disappointed in this movie, given that I am quite a fan of both Zack Snyder's and Nolan's works. Points highlighted as below:-Pros:- 1. Probably the most vulnerable superman film in terms of his humanity and the struggles in search of identity and belonging. Probably the first movie to show how his powers were a discomfort to him. Probably the first movie that shows how imperfect he was and he was not able to protect everyone 2. Mind-blowing action sequences of the usual Zack Snyder-quality 3. Great acting performances by all-star studded cast 4. No room for unnecessary romance (except for a ridiculous 3-4 min of the movie) which was a good move given that it was the story of his initial journey as Superman 5. They made Lois Lane the Best Reporter to ever appear in Movies - a true investigator, and a very daring one 6. They made the Kent parents very cool and modern parents in their own rightCons:- 1. The biggest flaw is that this movie went against all key fundamentals that defines Superman. Although the action sequences were beautifully made, I was more troubled by them (rather than savouring them) because the film conveniently ignored and 'censored' the HUGE amount of human (by-standers) casualties caused by the destruction. No excuses on 'the world now is a darker place so destruction should be more realistic' because such massive destruction happened in the movie as the parties involved did not do their jobs properly to make the inevitable less painful. The fact that Superman allowed this to happen, and partake in it without worrying about human lives (except for a few key characters) was seriously horrendous to the very essence that build his character. I would have been more satisfied if Superman tried to save a few more other than Lois even if he can't save a whole city of citizens. But For instance, his fight scenes with Zod could be better done elsewhere (i.e. lure him away from the dense civilization to the ocean or something?) without smashing into buildings and causing potential loss of innocent survivors. HELLO? If Batman could do it (when fighting against his villains in Nolan's movies), why cant Superman do it?2. How on earth, when the breathe support was down, did Zod able to permanently adapt to Earth's atmosphere at the last moments for such a long fight scene? This script was written by Nolan, 'revenge' was NOT a convenient excuse 3. Another STUPID major error - Superman cant breathe in Kriptonian Spaceship (quite obvious it wasn't due to any Kripton material). It is a well known fact Superman can hold his breath in vacuum/ outer space where there is no air at all, and it was already explained in the movie that he learned the art of sharpening his focus4. Superman allowed his hometown to be devastated (again I don't want to repeat the point of any potential loss of lives) in unnecessary long fight scenes when he could have just K.O. his foes by ripping all the Kriptonian's breathing masks off. HELLO! Both Superman and ZOD himself explained in the movie that 'their temporary weakness was revealed'5. Superman actually murdered someone in this movie. That scene was not well-made. I do not know for sure if he had other ways to prevent the murder, but logically speaking he should have other ways because he IS Superman and he already said in the movie he can do things that others cant (a choke hold is the LAMEST way to go about it). Sure he showed regrets and even consulted Lois for his actions, but that scene lasted for a mere 5 minutes which was barely a justification for such a radical change in Superman's character - and then we have that stupid ending6. Too many inconsistencies in the plot - the same flaw seen in The Dark Knight Rises - for example, Why do they need Lois Lane on board the Kriptonian spaceship (and with a welcoming breathing mask for her) when her purpose in the end was to disrupt their operations? Why did Clark take such a stupid risk to decide to hand over to Lois his father's chip? Why when was a planet about to be destroyed, have its citizens care about their last few hours of their lives deciding how to banish some 'war criminals' , which actually made more sense to banish them to stay in the dying planet and use the ice technology to save a few good/ deserving citizens to carry on the Kryptonian's survival? In one-on-one scenes, Why did only a few Kryptonians went into real confrontational action against humankind and the heroes (what were the others doing)? Why did people or Daily Planet seemed to be calm and not question the government on the disturbing videos? The government's scientist / doctor already mentioned that the World Device was using GRAVITY force, and yet the commander sent war planes to destroy the devices, and the scientist was there too. HOW STUPID! It would be very very awkward if Clark Kent can retain his hidden identity in MOS 2, given that too many people knew about his identity ever since his childhood",Null,1,3,16 June 2013
Hugo," Scorsese should be banned from the Oscars!
","A real disappointment this one. I am familiar with Scorsese's style of inputting in scenes or characters that may appear random but humorous in their own way, but to realize at a stage where everything is so disjointed -- the characters and the pieces of the plot fail to connect to each other to explain things properly but instead just informing the audience that everything is just some sort of ridiculous coincidence?And Scorsese do you expect me to believe something like that is enough to traumatize a person for life, and another thing as simple as that is enough to give a wake up call? Such amateurish writing and direction - not to mention the severe lack of chemistry between some of the actors who should have expected to excel even more! Please, stay away from the Oscars! Clearly Martin Scorsese does not qualify to be a versatile director, as his attempt to direct an unusual kid fantasy film is so far off from his forte, or he has become too old and should retire in peace.",2,5,11,18 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Another film about mental disorders that CAN make viewers mentally-disordered
","Like The Descendants, this is another film that makes its characters shouts and screaming at each other all the time. But it doesn't work very well. Okay, if the main character has problems that is fine but his family, supposedly normal folks, doesn't look normal to me as they did not realistically try to keep things as low-profile as possible. As if they enjoyed the attention of them being the most annoying family in the neighbourhood. I am not convinced whether the movie is accurate in portraying the realm of clinical psychology, and it made even worse with a cliché and even more unrealistic ending. Maybe I am off-the-mark of what the film is trying to show here, but seems to me everyone (including the dancers which made a remark that I felt was really silly) and even the film itself is kind of dysfunctional and the only person that made realistic sense to me, despite her aggressive behaviour, is Jennifer Lawrence's character.",3,22,45,13 January 2013
The White Ribbon," Nothing is white around here...
","This movie achieved something where many other similar works exploring on the darkest sides of humanity failed to accomplish - choosing the right medium, mood and a right balance to demonstrate so powerfully the sick, unfathomable downfall of human nature.Shot in black-and-white, the medium was a perfect way of revealing features that helped focus the attention of the viewer to guess what truly was the beginning of all that is evil. But by spending too much time thinking about it, anyone will miss out the bigger picture, that is probably a small flaw in my opinion in that it leads the audience astray from the bigger truth.The movie knows not to reveal too much, for evil is not something that can be explained by any root or cause...it is manifested by all the repercussions and external influences making waves within the surrounding environment and to future generations.Even more so in a society where people are trapped within the limited knowledge of what they can immediately see and feel, under the absence of TV and internet to escape from the collective mental cage, and in a small village where even the darkest secrets are in no way easy to be hidden to everyones else including the children, this psychological collateral damage is amplified",9,0,2,19 November 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Failed remake.
","Fincher has once again consistently failed to accomplish a credible work to my taste.This time, given a bigger budget and the advantage of being able to analyze its Swedish predecessor, unfortunately does not make up for the still many faults in this movie. Although I come to understand the plot is more faithful to the novel, the poor editing and the awkward pace had only succeeded in messing up the flow of thought by the lead characters and their actions, subsequently, appeared distorted to the audience...thus giving the effect that some of the conclusions or deductions arrived at were abrupt and lacked ample reasoning, and some of the actions were nonsensical (because they happened too quickly or lacked proper follow-through), all of which were more clearly explained in Män som hatar kvinnor.I am not even going to credit acting performances...yes they SHOULD be better than the 2009 version, given the fact that the actors have the privilege to improvise from the first movie, but aside from Mara who did a great job dramaticizing the role of the main character, the rest are just mehhhh.... Actions are so unrealistic and sometimes inconsistent. For example, the ending (which i understand is altered from the novel)...is she too dumb to not be aware of that?",3,8,13,17 November 2012
No Country for Old Men," A villain that can rival The Joker
","Amongst the 5 nominated films for last year's best film for the Oscar, this is the only film that i give credit, and funny it reminds me of Dark Knight in every aspect. It superseded my expectations as, besides the fact that the villain is cool (in fact i would say he can rival The Joker in Dark Knight himself) the movie dives deeper into a bigger picture as the story flows and that itself is amazing feat. Controversial issues that are relevant even to today's society is being brought up in style. Thus, like the Dark Knight, this film is bigger than the story itself. Truly extraordinary, intriguing, and deserving for the Oscar nominations of that year.",6,1,3,25 November 2012
District 9," High marks given to this film that has eliminated the ET stereotype
","Pretty interesting that a candidate from a genre where I would normally not consider adding in my favourite list, actually made it.This movie impressed me with its originality and a different point of view - I have not felt so much for the aliens! This is probably the first film that eliminates 'stereotypes' towards aliens. Although it does have uncertainties and loopholes here and there, District 9 is one step closer towards a highly probably outcome if the situation actually takes place in real life, and is likely to form a good base for future movies to come that I hope will create a new market intended for viewers who demand something alien, but closer to reality than being imaginary.",7,2,3,19 November 2012
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Not a film to be remembered
","yes it is beautiful, the cinematography is unique indeed, but the script although appears to be cleverly written, the whole movie doesn't seem to be realistic enough to be convincing...look at this, 1 person gunfiring against 3 in a room? and as robbers they have such poor gunfire skills....shooting at each other at only few metres apart and still just managed to injure a leg?? conversation-wise, at times it lacks depth that i don't see what or why they are talking about ( not talking about casey's character or when people are talking to him though) when the story is already that slow-paced...even the acting does not help much to repair this seemingly disjointed plot. It relies too much on narration apparently to save some of its flaws in this regard.",4,0,3,25 November 2012
Django Unchained," Sorry, Tarantino and Cowboys don't mix well, do more research on Deadwood please!
","I don't hate this film for the sheer entertainment action/gore value almost to the point of being bombastic for almost 3 hours. I don't hate this film for the great acting performances and gripping dialogue which made full use of the chemistry between the characters juggling through their cat-and-mouse mindgames typical of a Tarantino-style.However, I am not convinced that it deserves a nomination this time around. Tarantino must have been trying to outsmart his audience by trying to cover up massive plot holes with chunkful of conversations options 'showing off to the world' how cool this movie is compared to the rest of the action films in the genre. Things I hated are i) the seemingly lazy, recycled material from Inglorious Basterds especially the multi-European language related to Chris Waltz' character. Sorry Tarantino, mixing this with a Cowboy-based setting is just a no-no. ii) The matter of realism was never been taken seriously in any of Tarantino's films which is alright for my review, but to build on a premise of a NON-American travelling with a BLACK on a full suit, weaponry and horse, making themselves so obvious to everyone's attention when they are in the BOUNTY HUNTING business in a ruthless Deadwood era, and manage to outsmart the purportedly stupider local cowboys is beyond preposterous and belittling Tarantino's intelligence or quality towards his trademark. (Even the exaggerated characters made for the alternate reality in Inglorious Basterds had little more sense in their backgrounds) Oh and did i need to mention some of the music scores were off the mark? iii) Dr Schultz killing off random slavers without risked getting a bounty on his own head? Nice try. iv) Django's restraint behaviour even when his loved one is on the verge of 'sent off to N**gger heaven' does not match with Tarantino's aggression style. v) The taunts or threats by the villains are not consistent with a typical Western film, they do too much talking rather than with their guns. vi) A bounty hunter with the skills to hunt down the greatest criminals, came into Candyland with such mediocre preparation is laughable. vii) Why shoot the white girl who defended yours girl in a particular scene?",5,0,7,13 January 2013
Schindler's List," Epic, but fail to be believable enough for me
","An epic true statement about probably the only member of the Nazi party that saved the victims behind one of the most atrocious massacre in history...and surprisingly, despite the heart-wrenching details and the inhumane deeds being presented on-screen, it gave off quite an overall positive impact too.However, It failed to be included into my top list. Considering the weight of the subject matter, i expected a lot more from this movie. I believe the movie could have investigated things deeper and further given the amount of time allocated to this movie.But it didn't, and some of the scenes behave in a way that I think it was kind of sugarcoated, or over-dramatized, that sometimes I wonder whether the scenes meant to emulate the harsh truth of war did serve their purpose. I am not saying the atrocities should have been made more gory - it doesn't need to - all I am asking and expecting is to do more justice to viewers who are relying on this movie to understand what has happened in a the full extent of this historical chapter.",5,1,7,25 November 2012
The Hurt Locker," Heavily Technically Flawed!
","Loved the originality of the character study...the actors are really phenomenal in their parts of portraying both as soldiers and as humans.However, too many inaccuracies in the setting and how the military functions. It doesn't take much effort for one like me who has never experience military training to see that something is wrong somewhere. Why would a soldier take off his hat before sniping? Why are they taking such a sweet time in the desert waiting for more targets to come out? What is the point of the taxi driver wasting his time? Any logical reason for the main character taking his sweet time detonating bombs (i.e. taking out his gears for dumb reasons/talking/throwing his radio etc), won't the bomb possibly have timers installed? The terrorists must be either too rich or pretty stupid to leave TOO MANY bomb supplies and other 'valuables' behind in a building, facing only a troop with numbers you can count with your fingers... How did the main character came out unnoticed by security in the merchant's truck and return to camp the same way?? Why did the terrorist shoot the car to incinerate it and did nothing else (it would make more sense for him to kill some soldier in the process)? Anyway, 4 stars given to the character study. Period.",4,1,2,18 November 2012
Lincoln," Seems there is a missing 'Link' in Lincoln
","Spielberg ticked me off once again. This movie is very boring - even more so for the viewers like me who are unfamiliar with the detailed history preceding Lincoln's death. In fact, the whole >2 hours film was dedicated extensively to an event that involved political plays and nothing else. I have to say, at the end of the movie I don't feel much for the characters including Lincoln and the nation's civilians (the soldiers, the slaves who benefited from the amendment, or Lincoln's close friends and families) because that is how imperfect this movie turned out to be. The movie doesn't deserved to be given such a title as I still do not know much who Lincoln really was - his childhood, how he met his wife, more light on the family life? These were either non-existent or not elaborated enough.Speaking of his wife, now I do not know if her depiction was accurate, but her role in the film only made the whole movie experience worse with her constant blabbering typical of a near control-freak housewife. Sally Field acted well befitting the demand of her role, but it doesn't save the film overall. Lincoln himself blabbers a lot too, and I wont blame it on the huge mouthful of dialogue which I assumed is the intended style of the film. So many things that were being uttered by him were pure gibberish coming from an accomplished politician and country leader, in contrast to some of the supporting characters who said things that made more sense. But I would commend a great performance from Daniel Day Lewis despite all the irritating flaws mentioned.",5,5,11,5 January 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Much more believable
","I have heard of the substantial changes in the plot from the novel's. Usually in cases like these it will cost the movie a huge rating off my list for distorting the original source material, unless it is for a good reason. But so what? Just by solely comparing this to the American remake, this is still much better as a movie, due to the following reasons: plot flow makes more sense (many things that were not conveyed properly in the American version is explained very well here), more development flow especially from the lead characters (you get to hear more of their thoughts) as compared to the 'plastic' facade of the lead characters in the American version. And setting-wise, it looks more realistic to me. Actions make more sense. For example, how the American version of Lisbeth is able to, all by herself, physically intrude upon so many P&C files, across secured buildings without much disruption or paperwork, and in such a short time, is such an imaginary James Bond-feel that will never happen in real life. In this Swedish version, her research relies more on hacking and on third parties to carry out her work. The Lisbeth in this version is less omnipresent in a way, which is in turn more believable.",6,1,2,18 November 2012
The Artist," Silence is its strongest power
","This is the first film that I chose to review during my Oscar Marathon 2012 and already I can tell this is the contender to beat.Knowing a thing or two about black and white films, I am already amazed by how much The Artist manages to preserve all the classic characteristics and techniques of the films from the era it supposedly represents...for instance the static shots on a typical set of a staircase that you can only see in old films.Acting is flawless (All lead actors nailed their roles throughout) and some scenes are very cleverly shot using the essence of silent movements in the movie. But above all, this film has in its entirety paid homage to a very important history in movie-making (change from silent to talkies), and even though it utilizes musical score synonymous to a typical orchestra accompanying silent movies of those era, the visual appeal and body language alone are its strongest communication tool.",9,2,3,18 November 2012
Departures," Should have departed from the Oscar Award
","there is a beauty in this film that only the Japanese culture is capable of expressing it out. It is the same quality akin to the wabi sabi concept, where even the little things in life, and things which we often take for granted or stay away, such as death, have their own perceived value. Although the overall plot is rather shallow and at times comedic, the beauty that surrounds death and those that have to send off their kins away, is something that will keep anyone glued to the screen.Hence, it is a good film, and it is understandable why it beat other foreign movie contenders (waltz with bashir and entre les murs), however, I personally think that it did not deserve the Oscars, considering that many elements are still lacking in this movie. In particular, I find the lack of visibility on the outcome of the main character's messed-up life, or what he thinks about himself, a little disturbing, considering that most viewers have a severe lack of knowledge on the lives of people in this line of work. Too much focus was diverted to the job and the clients' feelings. If the director have add a little more to this movie, i might change this statement.",7,0,2,23 November 2012
Les Misérables," The musical was great, can't say the same for this movie
","The musical was almost flawless, even though it was a compressed version of a great novel that had a lot more to tell. This movie, trying to be an exact copy of the musical, fell short of expectations, and my expectations were not great to begin with. Some of the actors were chosen well but most of the A list actors did not act as well as their counterparts in the musical, which is a sad fact given that the musical performers are unlikely to be perceived as serious actors and I felt the actors in the movie did not tackle their roles seriously enough when they were known for more challenging acting roles in their careers. And yes, I am not even mentioning that a lot of them can't sing well either. Was disappointed that the movie chose to stick wholly to the musical. It could have done a lot more, by bringing flash scenes or background stories in the middle of the songs to bring more colour and depth where the musical can't do, instead of opting for the horrible prolonged effect of the camera close up on the actors face, and I mentioned before, some of them did not act at their best. That said, the movie had a chance to add extra flavour from the novel but did not utilize this to its advantage. The changing of the scenes were too abrupt, that the impression I am left with is akin to a series of MV,for instance those who are not familiar with the musical may find it hard to identify who was the little Cosette when she first appeared because the transition changed too soon without warning. and that took away a lot of emotional attachment that I rmb from the musical. Some of the best scores were right at the beginning of the movie itself but the actors somehow managed to ruin the moment. The ending was another letdown in comparison to the musical's far more inspiring version.",5,7,17,26 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Heavily Technically Flawed! Again!
","I had reservations when I saw the name of the director who was responsible for the disastrous Hurt Locker (which I can only rate 4/10 stars, titled Heavily Technically Flawed! Well, looks like I am tempted to recycle this title again. Although the delivery looks better than Hurt Locker, the problem with this film came haunting back as technical flaws and wrong cultural perceptions again. Recreating real life stories (even if you have to adjust for some scenes for the sake of commercial appeal) is not that hard to do given the competitive movie-making talent nowadays - the real challenge to me is making sure the key details (even if they do not contribute to the plot) stays intact.There were enough critic articles out there that were disappointed in how inaccurate the film is depicting the situation and the lifestyle in Pakistan, such prejudice that are available in so many sources that I wont comment here. Argo was also victim of this flaw, by the way.For this movie, I would like to borrow from Esquire's interview of the shooter of bin Laden himself, his thoughts on the film seemed to show that he was turned off by the technical flaws as well, but commended on the film's portrayal of the CIA female analyst Maya:- 'They torture people in this movie, don't they? Everyone is chained to something.' The Shooter is sitting next to me (the interviewer) at a local movie theater in January, watching Zero Dark Thirty for the first time. He laughs at the beginning of the film about the bin Laden hunt when the screen reads, 'Based on firsthand accounts of actual events.' His uncle, who is also with us, along with the mentor and the Shooter's wife, had asked him earlier whether he'd seen the film already.'I saw the original,' the Shooter said. As the action moves toward the mission itself, I ask the Shooter whether his heart is beating faster. 'No,'. But when a SEAL Team 6 movie character yells, 'Breacher!' for someone to blow one of the doors of the Abbottabad compound, the Shooter says loudly, 'Are you kidding me? Shut up!' He explains afterward that no one would ever yell, 'Breacher!' during an assault. Deadly silence is standard practice, a fist to the helmet sufficient signal for a SEAL with explosive packets to go to work.During the shooting sequence, which passes, like the real one, in a flash, his fingers form a steeple under his chin and his focus is intense.But his criticisms at dinner afterward are minor.'The tattoo scene was horrible,' he says about a moment in the film when the ST6 assault group is lounging in Afghanistan waiting to go. 'Those guys had little skulls or something instead of having some real ink that goes up to here.' He points to his shoulder blade.'It was fun to watch. There was just little stuff. The helos turned the wrong way toward the target, and they talked way, way too much during the assault itself. If someone was waiting for you, they could track your movements that way.' The tactics on the screen 'were bad,' he says, and 'the mission in the movie took way too long' compared with the actual event. The stairs inside bin Laden's building were configured inaccurately. A dog in the film was a German shepherd; the real one was a Belgian Malinois who'd previously been shot in the chest and survived. And there's no talking on the choppers in real life.There was also no whispered calling out of bin Laden as the SEALs stared up the third-floor stairwell toward his bedroom. 'When Osama went down, it was chaos, people screaming. No one called his name.' 'They Hollywooded it up some.' The portrayal of the chief CIA human bloodhound, 'Maya,' based on a real woman whose iron-willed assurance about the compound and its residents moved a government to action, was 'awesome' says the Shooter. 'They made her a tough woman, which she is.' The Shooter and the mentor joke with each other about the latest thermal/night-vision eyewear used in the movie, which didn't exist when the older man was a SEAL.'Dude, How come I never got my four-eye goggles?' 'We have those.' 'Are you kidding me?' 'SEAL Team 6, baby.' They laugh, at themselves as much as at each other.The Shooter seems smoothed out, untroubled, as relaxed as I've seen him.But the conversation turns dark when they discuss the portrayal of the other CIA operative, Jennifer Matthews, who was among seven people killed in 2009 when a suicide bomber was allowed into one of their black-ops stations in Afghanistan.They both knew at least one of the paramilitary contractors who perished with her.The supper table is suddenly flooded with the surge of strong emotions. Anguish, really, though they both hide it well. This is not a movie. It's real life, where death is final and threats last forever.",5,3,8,6 April 2013
The Reader," Too many unnecessary scenes
","I am very disappointed in this movie too. The director prefers a slow-paced movie...but in view of the subject being discussed, it would make the movie whole lot better if some of the unnecessary things were given lessor importance.For instance, the sex scenes at the beginning were such a drag and could have been cut really short to keep things just at the right amount.Other scenes could have been made at a slightly heightened pace, to allow more discussion on important matters and issues that this movie fail to bring out. I will give credit to winslet's intense acting performances which somehow helped me to endure through this slow torture.",5,0,1,24 November 2012
The Wrestler," A True movie for Wrestlers?

Looking at the poster and the title i initially assumed that this is going to be another one of those bullshit movies but it turn out to be quite the opposite. It is not exactly phenomenal or memorable in anyway, but it is not so simple to watch either. All i see throughout this movie is very...human, human as i hv never seen before within and outside the wrestling rings, human as if u are really witnessing a testimony of a wrestler, and feel that you might have ended up in the same situation yourself if life takes a different route...and that is itself a rare quality in good movies nowadays.

Inception," Nolan has successfully placed his audience in a state of limbo, literally.
","As expected from one of my most respectable directors of all time, this is one hell of a brilliant masterpiece, cleverly sculpted in many aspects. Though the fast pace of the film renders the significance of certain details, such as the organization who hired the dream stealers, the totems and how Saito was targeted in the first place was dimmed -- possibly a deliberate motive to keep us guessing or unraveling its ambiguity. this film may be an exceptional thriller, but it is certainly not qualified to be an exceptional dream film, as compared to say, Mulholland drive or Donnie Darko. I have yet to see a perfect dream film anyway.This is because Nolan placed too much logic in a realm where dreams are supposedly logic-free. For instance, projections do not necessarily die after getting shot in a dream right? All in all, the ending is truly remarkable. No one will ever know what the real conclusion would be. The actual 'dream' could have started anywhere in any point in the film (there was a scene where Leonardo's totem spinning was interrupted and he never spun again aside from the limbo scene). Nolan successfully placed his audience in a state of limbo, literally.",9,1,4,18 November 2012
Defiance," Finally a Film that offers a Differenct perspective of WWII
","I am in doubt over its historical accuracies on the Bielski guerilla, but I have to say I am impressed with this film. It is not made like any other war movie nor any other action movie, but a film about survival which gives a really fresh new look on a war period which is over-glamourised in films for so long.Although this means a great lack of action and the usual casualties of war, all these are compensated by a bold testimony of their commitment to never stop being strong and stay alive for each other.Nevertheless, the plot could have been made much better. Some scenes are unnecessary and some could be improvised. Although there are scenes that are pretty solid and deliver strong messages that keep me glued on despite a slow pace. Individual performances are just right and satisfactory, everyone acted really well for their roles including Craig.I am glad to come across a film where some Jews, in WW2, died by natural death and not by the hands of the Germans. Probably the best reason why i don't hate this film ( In fact Schindler's List failed to impress me).",6,2,4,24 November 2012
The Blind Side," Not without Flaws, but shed a lot of tears
","The blind side is not a biopic on Micheal but a family biopic that showcase the amazing changes one can do with family bonding.It is meant to be a heartwarming movie, but what makes it different from most other heartwarming movies is that the script is designed to make anyone waste off tissue boxes in every few scenes. The director certainly maintains the neutrality of the movie very well; he did not eliminate the stereotype issues like racism but instead embrace them just enough to be undetectable.However, this comes at its own costs of deterring from reality to a slightly more fairy tale-like sequence of events. For instance, the encounter of Leanne with the drug dealers, and the encounter with the real mother who, surprisingly, is much more stable and receptive of the situation than what I would expect (considering the actual timeline where the racial tension is supposed to be more vile?).Otherwise, this movie succeeded in draining a large water amount from me. And, yes, I think Bullock does deserve her Oscars, even though there may be other nominees more deserving. From her interview it was clear how much effort she put in to portray as close to the real person as possible but admitted that it is 'impossible because Leanne is simply original'.",6,1,2,18 November 2012
Rango," It is entirely predictable!
","Looks like I have finally found a winner for the Oscars of that year that the awards should reconsider picking. Rango can be summarized in a line used by one of its characters 'its entirely predictable'...and it really is.Looking at modern animation nowadays, i am sorry to say, this cartoon has more clichéd elements and more uninteresting characters that are lacking both in terms of depth and intelligence (seriously, is this how they want to fool the kids? Even though it is just a cartoon?). Also, even with a cowboy theme, it appears quite dead as compared to other real cowboy-theme non-cartoon movies. The score could have been much higher if the film is smart enough to introduce the back stories of the main characters -- who is Rango? Who is the female lead? or the villain? or the Mayor? I have no idea at all.",3,0,3,18 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's weakness resurfaced; TDK is still the best
","It is a huge undertaking to create a concluding movie meant to super cede TDK, which is still the best action film I have watched in a long time, and overall TDKR didn't disappoint, but it could have been better in my opinion.The same fast-paced elements are there, and I liked the fact that this movie is an overall bird's eye view on all key characters rather than too much camera focus on the main heroes/ villains themselves. Also, in almost all superhero movies, the main characters are too one dimensional (1-D), in that they are either too cool or too depressed and never change across time, but in this film some of our beloved characters have 'changed', and therefore appeared to be more human.One main problem is that I have realized that Nolan CANNOT excel in creating epic physical catastrophic effects as compared to psychological catastrophic effects. TDK (with the Joker) was the reason for the latter, and understandably Nolan have chosen two aspects for this movie to match up to TDK's ambitions - one is that if TDK was Batman in a crisis, TDKR is Batman in his downturn; another aspect is the villain this time, though far less brilliant than Joker, is more direct & devastating in terms of his aggression. The former aspect worked really well for the first 1.5 hours as we see that Batman/Wayne's reputations were no longer what they used to be, their lives were hell and Batman was ultimately a human like the rest, in that he had turned out to be tardy and useless as well.However, Nolan's failure becomes more apparent in the second half of the movie when all of the COLLATERAL damage comes in - too much physical destruction going on but failed to cover up for too many unrealistic actions because the story had to go on at a pace way too fast. Also, I have yet to watch a movie with 'bombastic' actions going on and managed to escape all forms of cliché elements - Nolan has failed in Inception, and he failed again in this test too. Unlike TDK, TDKR has finally given in into convention in certain ways and that has cost a big rating penalty from me..for example, an injured, bankrupt and gadget-less Wayne apparently had no problem returning to a city where the villain had made extensive attempts to destroy all access points and maintained strict control over them.Still, overall I liked this movie as it could have been much worse (according to almost all sequels historically) and manages to live up close to or on par with TDK, though sometimes I wonder if Inception was an audition process for Marion and Joseph's part in TDKR :)",7,3,6,17 November 2012
Her," Interesting depiction of life with an intelligent OS
","A good science fiction movie leaves behind viewers critical- thinking angles, and Her is no exception. To me the big win is how the direction was very clear towards the actors. I was impressed by how the actors depicted the nature of the people's behaviour living in a IT society where the current Iphone/touchscreen technology that we are familiar with had become redundant. The OS evolved to a level where Personal Assistants will be literally put out of job. However these OS are not just IT- intelligent but they have the emotional intelligence too. This movie investigates the prospect of the relationship between the human owner with his OS could become complicated. I think the key aspects were covered adequately though not entirely well rounded. But the outcome was too predictable in my opinion, and was quite apparent when I watched the first 30 min of the movie. The movie was a tad too slow for me and I think there is definitely room to add more spice. Could have been better if family members (or people of different generations) are added in because this will enrich the perspective substantially. Overall, the acting performances were good.",7,1,3,2 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Cheesy Ending was A Great LetDown to its Unconventional Perfection
","just when i thought 2008 is lacking good movies, i didn't expect a movie of this calibre to come out. I understand why it wins all the categories in all of critic awards. The key -- A one-of-a-kind originality and level of raw detail unlike anything i have seen in my life. Boyle manages to make this movie so unconventional, via many award-winning aspects from the script (well done making a good story linking to the game who wants to be millionaire?) , screenplay, background detail, soundtrack etc. (camera-angle is very different to other movies, music score refreshing and unique, very intrinsic detail on India's poverty, though i doubt some parts of its accuracy. No matter how good other movies can be, they all have to bow hands down to slumdog's raw, unconventional power for these award categories.The style in this movie makes me wonder if this should be classified as a British film -- so unlike one. It may be like a documentary too...so like one. Again, the marvel of its unconventionality.However, there are flaws in this film as well, though i think these flaws somehow also make up to its unconventional features. Don't expect top-class acting here...besides the slum kids' performance (I heard that they are actually real slum kids getting paid to act), the rest are like what u expect in a low-class soap opera. Certainly the director fail to master all the details about India, especially towards the second half of the movie.The adult actors do not connect well with their past childhood characters, e.g. I don't believe the adult Jamal-version when he has been living an active, attentive and dangerous slum life throughout where survival with lots of guts and wits is a constant routine. I expect him to be more angry and street-wise, shown when he was in his teen stages.And note that the adult actors are too good -looking. Speaking of that, the teenagers jamal and Kamil are too clean to look like slum kids.Certainly it deserves to win whatever it won, but i have to say it is far from being the best movie of 2008. Apart from all that, the storyline is filled with many clichéd elements ,especially the disappointing cheesy ending, it might be more memorable if it based on something much larger and deeper than just a love story. Or if the director avoids the clichéd parts (he has already successfully win the hearts of millions with his unconventional work, so why does he resolve to that kind of ending?? how disappointing is that?). If u think about it, it is just an upgraded version of a typical bollywood style movie.",7,0,3,24 November 2012
The Breakfast Club," Another Timeless Movie - If only such a Club Existed
","A good classic that expresses well about young people and how they live through their lives. Another great film that can relate well to any youth that watches it. It has many whacky moments that all 80's films have but i am impressed with how matured the characters are when they opened serious discussions that even friends nowadays tend to avoid. Although the movie is very old, the issues being brought up are timeless and the message conveyed here is very powerful. If all school kids watch this film and learn from these lessons, differences between people can be resolved, boundaries can be broken, and the world (starting from school level) will be a much friendlier place with lessor pretense.",9,2,3,25 November 2012
The Social Network," Too bad for a flawed script
","The reason why such a great movie can only deserve a mere 5 star is because of a MAJOR flaw -- scriptwriting.Knowing a little bit about Mark Zuckerberg and as an engineering student who had spent time with geeks and hardcore programmer back in university days, I can say for sure that this movie just showed how much lack of understanding it has towards the true nature of Zuckerberg.His character portrayal is totally wrong -- it is not wrong to have a strong enthusiasm and confidence/or arrogance behaviour, but it is not right that the movie portrayed him in such a way like everything he did or would do in the future is fueled not purely out of passion, but more like of a vengeful nature. Programmers, no matter how arrogant they are, do not behave like that. His face shows anger all the time, even Eduardo look more like the geek.These are not just my own opinions. Please read the REAL Mark Zuckerberg's own opinions about this movie -- he just summarized all the aforementioned -- and if the original, still living billionaire was that unhappy on a film about him, that's enough for a low rating from me. and what is with the addition of a break-up with girlfriend (who is not real) & that rubbish ending just for the sake of adding some Hollywood flavour? For a script that is ADAPTED from a book...come on is that all it can do? David Fincher, do you make movies to please yourself, or to stay true to the person who allow you to reveal his story to the world?",5,0,1,18 November 2012
Up in the Air," A Good Reminder for all Corporates/ Professionals
","Many touches of real life in today's world are arranged very well in this film. Moreover, they are very relevant -- you could be like Clooney, locked in his way of solitary life and withholding his twisted philosophy about work versus life, both engineered by the treads of corporate responsibilities and traveling; or you could be like Vera's, a female version of Clooney (I can imagine a powerful female CEO) with a twisted, sly way of fulfilling her needs of escape; or Anna's, a naive young smart employee who finds herself, after stepping into the world of career focus and all, eventually confused with the real world versus her ideals; or simply any one of those employees where the possibility of getting let go is uncertain. It is one of those films that serves as a reminder or where you will feel a whole lot wiser after watching it. The only few flaws are i.e. Vera's willingness to be his date for the wedding (which may place her reputation in grave danger), crash parties? (the orgy boat scene is over the top, i mean they are in the middle of work not holidaying), Anna's acceptance into a company (which she herself rejected earlier) just by a recommendation letter?? that is total bullshit that does not work anymore in a world of fierce competition, strict bureaucracies, over-qualifications and vast unemployment.",7,1,1,18 November 2012
Atonement," Keira was a letdown
","it was excellent, a well made movie with some thoughts to ponder...accompanied by strong cast, good script and an amazing score...however there are holes in the plot; some things that were not explained and they seemed to be ignored, and Keira is dull as always...putting on her usual one-dimensional acting which was fortunately covered up by her counterpart McAvoy's stronger performance. At times the characters' faces looked disgustingly unreal, perhaps too much make up? the dressing (esp keira's) seems to be too revealing for people living in that era; and nothing moving enough or thought provoking enough to impress my mind. Disappointingly speaking, there were many more better and Oscar-deserving movies of 2007",7,1,3,16 December 2012
