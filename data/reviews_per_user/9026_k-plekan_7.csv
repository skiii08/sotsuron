Casablanca," A Classic Romance
","This movie, for it's time, is shot in a wonderfully way. The black and white of the movie I think adds to a classical effect. If the movie was in normal color, I don't believe that it would have had the effect that it did.The sound especially helped set the mood for the movie. The movie took place during the Occupation of Europe and during that time there was a lot music. Music is what kept people going.The music helped the emotions show through the characters. It was a story that many people could relate to if they were ever in a relationship.Overall I would recommend this because all the camera angles, transitions, sound, color, plot and characters made the movie interesting. You may have to watch it a second time to get all the smaller details, but certainly a movie that should be watched once.",7,0,3,27 October 2010
Citizen Kane," Great Mystery and Classic
","Citizen Kane is indeed a true classic and well worth the watch.The way the movie was filmed was indeed something that helped make it wonderful. Especially the way that it started off with the broadcast. The black and white made it even more interesting. The characters were developed and helped the story move on and continue pushing the story even more forward. The use of lighting, flashback, sound and setting helped create a true movie. The setting and locations were absolutely beautiful. This is certainly a movie that you should see at least once. This movie is a classic and has many many things that help shape what a real movie is.",8,0,1,15 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," A Movie True to the Depression
","The Grapes of Wrath is a classic movie that is true to the time period that it takes time in.You can tell that a lot of work went into this movie. Throughout the movie the scenery and setting changes multiple times. You travel from farmland and country side to the road and city. You see mountains and rivers, cities and woods, a city of tents and then a campground. All the scenery added to the different scenes of the movie. Without the scene change the movie would not be able to change and move along the way it did.The lighting in this movie was fantastic. When it was night, there was very limited lighting, when it was daylight, the scene was brightened with the effects of the sun. It gave you the real effect that you were in the movie itself.The storyline, although depressing, is true to the time period. It shows the effects of what the depression had on a family and taught a very important lesson. To Never Give Up.",7,0,1,13 October 2010
The Graduate," An Enjoyment
","I remember once that I heard about a movie like this but I never actually saw it. When I watched this movie in class I really did enjoy it because it combined all the different emotions that humans have and how we react to certain situations. This movie was rather funny in the beginning and towards the end it became more serious. In the beginning all the awkwardness was rather funny which made it enjoyable and kept my attention. In the end I was still captured by the film because it was getting more intense because relationships became complicated.To me the movie showed a certain message. The way that he was tangled in the web of the affair with the mother, he was being manipulated and was somehow a puppet. In the end when the daughter and the graduate ran off with each other, it was as if they were breaking away from the older generation to live their own life.",9,1,2,17 December 2010
Psycho," Unexpected
",For years I have heard and seen references from the movie 'Psycho' and I never knew why it was so popular. I was already familiar with the fact that there was a shower scene in which the woman got stabbed repeatedly but I never knew why she got stabbed or what the point of the movie was. After I finally got the chance to watch it I realize that there is a good reason as to why it is a classic movie. Although I did not find it scary compared to many of the movie and thrillers that you see in the modern movie age. Overall I rather enjoyed watching Psycho after hearing so much about it over the years and I would recommend for anyone to see it at least once.,7,0,1,17 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Craziness and Sadness
","When my friend saw that this movie was on my list for movies to watch for my History of American Cinema class, she told me that I had to watch it and I did not have a choice. Of course this confused me. Yes I heard of the movie before but I never actually thought about watching it. Now I am glad that I watched it.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a crazy movie that is also very enjoyable. At first you thought things may go wrong because the main character wanted to get out of work detail at the prison by being considered 'crazy' and in the end it did, but the story before the ending events was heartwarming. Jack Nicholson's character saw all the other patients as people and accepted them for who they were. He accepted all of their flaws and had a good time with all of them.Although the ending was extremely sad, it also brought on new hope when the Chief was able to finally get his freedom.",9,1,2,17 December 2010
Saboteur," Not What I First Thought
","This movie is not what I first thought it would be.When I first read the movie description, I thought it would be a movie about fighting over in Europe. However it was not. Instead the movie was very good. The action and the realism that is seen in this movie brought to life the fear of what could actually happen to anyone you know. The movie played on the fears of people who lived at the time of War.It hits you right at home because the movie takes place in a country that is thought to be at times invincible. I would recommend this movie to anyone I know because it is very enjoyable and suspenseful.",8,0,1,15 December 2010
