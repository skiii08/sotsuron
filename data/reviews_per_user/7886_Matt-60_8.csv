United 93," Staggeringly good
","There was no applause when the film ended, there was almost no sound at all except for a few audible sniffles. The power of the film, especially the last 8 minutes, kept most of the people rooted in their seats through most of the credits. I think the only reason I wasn't crying at the end is because I was with a friend and no way am I'm going to lose it in front of a guy friend unless he loses it first. He felt the same which kept us both just barely on this side of sobbing. The movie takes its time, setting the day up, the bulk of the 9/11 hijackings are seen through the screens of the ATC, except of course for the United 93 hijacking. Seeing the news footage of the planes hitting the tower did not have much of an effect on me, I saw them 4.5 years ago and many times since then, so while they were well used here, that was not the part that really affects you. It is when the passengers learn that the planes have hit, and that their plane will not be landing at any airport that the film truly grabs hold of you with a vice grip. They know they have to retake the plane, they call their families to say goodbye, and those of us watching cannot look away from Greengrass' powerful film. People say that it is too soon, but I felt that it wasn't soon enough. We forget about the people who died, the heroes, the innocents who did not have a chance to be heroes. 9/11 has grown distant to so many of us, it has just become something for us to be angry about, be it angry at the terrorists who did this, or at the administration who so readily used it to justify their own agendas. This is not a political film, it does not judge or comment on policy before or after that day. This is a human film, and an intensely moving one.",10,7,15,29 April 2006
Blade," YES!
","How to review this movie....on a scale that you would review movies like the Godfather? NO! You look at it on several scales actually.  As a comic book movie, and as a gratuitist violence movie.  As a comic book movie it is good, but not great.  The imagery and violence is very comic-bookish, but as for plot and overall quality it cannot match The Crow or Batman.  As a violent movie however, it is one of the best I've seen.  The opening sequence alone is worth the full adult price of admission.  I wish I could see it on the big screen again.  The martial arts sequences are AWESOME....and I REALLY loved the swordplay.  A note to all...if you can't see this on DVD, at least get the widescreen version on video...pan and scan would destroy this movie.",Null,0,1,18 February 1999
American History X," Not a great movie, with brilliant performances
","Before I say anything about the movie itself, let me say that Ed Norton is brilliant (as usual) in this.  He is making it hard for me to decide who I want to win best actor this year.  Amazing. The movie however is not a great movie, but it has a good message.  It just wasn't well directed, the main qualm I had was the slow motion scenes.  with a couple of minor exceptions, such as when he was being arrested, they were laughable.  As for the plot, for the most part it was good.  the prison scenes had my full attention, but some stuff towards the end bugged me. Like the discussion with his father.  This seemed thrown in at the last second because the filmmakers thought that the original explanation wasn't good enough.  They should not have made his father into a racist like they did.  I would have been satisfied with just his dislike for affirmative action, but they had to push it over the edge and have him actually say it.In summary, not a well directed film, with brilliant performances.  It tackles a difficult subject, and that is good.",Null,0,0,7 March 1999
Batman Begins," The best Batman
","I grew up on the Tim Burton Batmans. I love the Tim Burton Batmans. I mean....Michelle Pfeiffer in the catsuit pretty much put me through puberty right then and there. So when I say that this movie blows Burton's out of the water...I do not say it lightly. This is Batman in the real world. Gritty, realistic(as much as a comic book movie ever will be) and full of 3 dimensional characters, fantastic action scenes, and the incredibly engaging story of how Bruce became the Bat. The acting is superb(some of the greatest actors alive today are in it), the music is outstanding...some of the most pulse pounding and engaging music I've ever heard in a film. Christopher Nolan is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, turning out one outstanding movie after another. Seeing this movie in IMAX was one of the greatest movie experiences of my life.",10,1,2,28 November 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Brilliant
","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, certainly the best Kung Fu film ever made.  Should be nominated for a whole score of oscars-Picture, director, actor, actress, cinematography, foreign film..etc etc :)  I cant wait for it to come out locally(saw it in paris with French subtitles).  The fights are incredible, now if only Jet Li's american stuff would be this good(come on Matrix sequels!) Check this one out people.",10,0,0,30 November 2000
Hero," Stunning
","Having followed the production of Hero since its inception one canimagine how badly I have been looking forward to this film, andhow high my expectations must be.  Because I live in San Diegoand not China, I had resigned myself to having to wait til Novemberto see it(the release date has been pushed to May as of the time ofthis review).  Fortunately for me, Hero premiered at the PalmSprings film festival, a scant 2.5 hours from here.  So me, myroommate, and some friends in L.A. all jumped in our cars anddrove out, betting that the film would be worth the drive.  We allagreed: TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!  This film completely met myexpectations and then some.  The plot centers on the legend of theassassins who were sent to kill the King of Qin, more than 2,000years ago.  Jet Li plays Nameless, a small territory prefect who isallowed to sit and drink with the Emperor for killing the threelegendary assassins, Broken Sword(Tony Leung-Chiu Wei), FlyingSnow(Maggie Cheung), and Sky(Donnie Yen).  The film is told inflashbacks as Nameless recounts how he did it.  The longawaited rematch between Jet Li and Donnie Yen takes place at thebeginning of the film, and while not quite as jaw dropping as theirdueling in ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA 2, it was a thing ofbeauty.  The choreography by Ching Siu Tung(who seems to do allthe wuxia films) and Wei Tung is excellent.  Christopher Doyle'scinematography is breathtaking throughout the film, and thiscombined with Emi Wada(Kurosawa's RAN)'s costumes play animportant part in the different versions of the stories that are told. Each version has a different color design, and each color has aspecific meaning, but I'm not going to tell you what.  Go see it andfind out.  Tan Dun's score, while very similar to his work onCrouching Tiger, is also perfectly used here, which is really all thatmatters.  All in all, the film is just amazing.  Obviously there aregoing to be a lot of comparisons made between Hero andCrouching TigerÂ…so here is mine.  Crouching Tiger was the bettermovie, but I like Hero more. 4 out of 4 stars.",10,0,0,21 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The best of the films
","Up until tonight y pick for best Potter film was Prisoner of Azkaban, hands down. It had the perfect blend of magic and realism that the others lacked, the direction was fantastic and the cast showing that under the direction of an amazing director like Alfonso Cuaron they could truly shine. I loved Prisoner of Azkaban, I love it more every time I see it. So when I say that Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film thus far, its a big deal to me. The movie is wonderful, the acting is top notch, Radcliff really shines here as Harry but everyone is excellent. The script is the best adaptation yet. Every decision to truncate or cut in order to fit an enormous book into a reasonable running time is perfect. Sure, I miss things, we all will, but unlike Goblet of Fire which made in my opinion every wrong choice on cutting story, this film did it all right. I honestly did not mind a single change, even the things I would have liked to have seen here were not necessary. I'm trying to keep this a spoiler free as possible so I won't say what parts I mean. I will say one spoilerish thing though..The wizard battle at the end was fantastic, wow. David Yates' direction was perfect, he knew just when to make things intense and when to make them emotional. He showed a real command of the material and how to realize it on screen. Hats off to him, I am very pleased that he will be directing Half Blood Prince. Now I just need to keep my fingers crossed that Alfonso will be back to do Deathly Hallows...",10,2,6,15 July 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," More action, but not as good.
","All in  all, the movie is pretty fugging cool, lots of great action scenes and cool visual effects.  Its really more like the first half of a 5 hour movie(completed in Revolutions), so some story stuff is introduced that has yet to be fleshed out.  The effects are extraordinary, but unfortunately I can still tell when they go to CGI in the fights, and it bothers me.  Its less bothersome here, since the worl do the Matrix is computer generated, so its sorta ok to have CGI fighters, unlike in Blade 2.  Problem is, I want to see real people duking it out, not pixels.  Martial arts are about what the human body can achieve, not what John Gaeta can do with his computer.  And I miss bullet-time.  Virtual cinematography just isnt the same.  Bullet time had real cameras moving through real space, virtual cinematography is fake.  But still...the movie rocked, i want to see it again already, and I just saw it last night.  The burly brawl(Neo vs a hundred Smiths) was awesome, despite the CGI, and I cant wait til Revolutions.",10,0,0,15 May 2003
