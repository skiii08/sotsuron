The Legend of Bagger Vance," The local hero must find his swing
","For all those that liked the Natural you will like this.  I cannot say that I find golf has quite the same dramatic punch as base ball but it was worth watching none the less.Adele Invergordon must rescue her father's dream project, an epic Southern golf course.  She tricks two of the days greatest golfers into playing in a exhibition, the scheming local Mayor trys to sabotage it by getting the local hero, Rannulph Junuh, to play.  Junuh has to exorcise some personal demons and tries to do so with the aid of a black caddy, Bagger Vance.Junuh also has to win back the heart of his lost love, Miss Invergordon. The story is played against sumptuous Southern scenery.  The accents are suitably Southern but without any racist overtones.The story is played to its conclusion during the course of the golf exhibition match.There are some light comedic touches and some weepie moments, so there should be something for everyone, but don't forget the Kleenex!",7,0,1,13 March 2001
Erin Brockovich," How the common person can take on the mighty and win.
","After all of the hype surrounding this film I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not! This film deserved to win Roberts the Oscar, her performance was superb. She plays the seemingly white trash Erin who may not have the qualifications but does not lack the intelligence. Through a simple research job she discovers that a large corporation has been poisoning the water supply of a town. She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement. It is not plain sailing for Erin as she has to overcome stereotypes and prejudice but she wins through in the end through her hard work and determination. Finney provides sterling support and his exchanges with Roberts provide some classic moments. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!",10,19,25,7 May 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A classic love story set against WWII
","The majority of the criticism that I had heard about this film related to the picture postcard location and the 'silly accents'. I have not read the book, yet! The accents were appropriate.The film opens on the Island of Cephalonia just before the outbreak of the second World War. Pelagia, the daughter of Iannis, the island's doctor becomes engaged to Mandras, a fisherman. Her father does not think that this is a good match but allows Pelagia to make her own choice. Mandras goes to fight the Italians. The war takes a turn for the worse and the island is invaded by the Italians with German support.The war does not really touch those that are based there. During this time a tentative romance develops between Pelagia and Corelli. After the Italians surrender the Germans massacre them. Some escape, Corelli amongst them. He is smuggled off of the island by Mandras and his partisans.The war ends and Pelagia is now a doctor. However, she still carries a torch for Corelli. Iannis writes to Corelli who returns and wins back Pelagia.The film does jump a little, but this is to be expected of a film based on a sweeping BOOK. This said, this does not spoil the FILM. The locations are beautiful, this cannot be helped either since the island is beautiful. This works as a romance which is what it is. The performances from the central characters, Cage and Cruz are good and make the story believable, I can forgive her the dire Woman On Top. Hurt provides a strong performance also. Bale is good in support. This is one to go and see and judge for yourself.",8,2,4,27 May 2001
Troy," What men will do for love
","Forget what you have heard about this film.  It is an epic tale told on an epic scale.  This film will join Gladiator and Pearl Harbour for sheer scale.  It matches Glory for the brutality of its battle scenes.  Although some liberties may have been taken with the story the basics have been retained.  This story is about what man will do for love and the consequences that follow.The performances are universally good.  The charactors are not portrayed romantically but with realism, flaws and all.This may be nearly three hours long but it rewards you with one of the most spectacular films of the year.  This is a must see and a must have when it comes to DVD later in the year.",10,1,3,1 June 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," The fate that awaits all thirysomethings, I wish.
","This is a MUST, MUST, MUST see film. There are too many funny moments to pick one out, although the knicker scene is destined to become a classic. The whole cinema was laughing at the misadventures of this 32 year old single female trying to have a life despite everyone else. In the end she finds happiness with the right man, of course. The journey there is in parts touching but the story is always told with humour. Anyone who said that a Texan could not play a sometimes dowdy Englishwoman had not allowed for the tour-de-force performance by Zellweger, any doubts about her acting ability, in some quarters are definitely laid to rest here. The supporting English cast were excellant as were Grant and Firth, (the fight scene!?)This is going to be one of the high spots of my cinema going year.",10,0,0,11 April 2001
Save the Last Dance," Live for dance
","Sara loses her mother and with it her desire to dance.  She is forced to move from her predominantly white home to live with her father in the rougher part of Chicago.  Her first day at her new, predominantly black High School sees her meet Derek in class.  They do not get along immediately, but she becomes friends with his sister Chenille and she learns that Derek is a brilliant student and is going to medical college when he graduates.  They start to date although this does not go down well with everyone, Derek dating a white girl is not popular within his black neighbourhood.  This film explores prejudice from both sides of the community.  Derek helps Sara to get back to the dance that she loves after the death of her mother and helps her with her free dance piece for her Julliard audition.  Despite a rough ride they stay together.  A good film, that shows the black and the white communities from a less stereotyped view point.  Both Stiles and Thomas give credible performances.",8,1,3,8 April 2001
Million Dollar Baby," The world of female boxing in all its glory
","This is the tale of a white trailer trash female boxer. She starts getting professional training from 'the best cut man' in the business late on in life, but proves to be a natural and has a knockout punch. She gets her chance at a title shot but is crippled by an after the bell punch, by the reigning champ and is paralysed. She loses a leg and then asks her trainer to end her life.This is boxing as it is at the grass roots. There is strong characterisation throughout and we get to know the three leads very well.Swank, Eastwood and Freeman are outstanding. This is going to be a film that walks away with awards and deservedly so. This is based on a story by someone who was involved in boxing and this background knowledge shows through. The story is told in a very real way and all of the characters come across with all their faults.",10,3,4,17 January 2005
Shrek 2," Shrek is back but more amusing
","This is one of those film rarities, it is more funny than the original. This film picks-up on Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon.  It then moves to the new in laws.  Shrek is reluctant to go but caves in to Fiona.  We then go to the kingdom of Far Far Away.  The plot mainly revolves around the secret deal between the King and the Fairy Godmother.  There are many jokes, both obvious and subtle that will appeal to both the adults and their children.The characterisation and acting is great as is the soundtrack.  For those of us that are real film geeks the take on the Fabulous Baker Boys at the end is brilliant.A must see movie.",10,0,1,6 July 2004
The Mummy Returns," The traitorous wife returns with avengence!
","Although some of the shock is not there this time round because you know what is coming in parts, this may well be a cinematic rarity, a sequel that is a good as the original.The film opens with Rick and Evie, now the happily married couple snooping around a tomb with their son in tow. Evie has been having some strange dreams about this dig, which is confirmed when she is able to open the tomb using keys which she knows nothing about. They fight of the baddies, a la Indiana Jones and go back to England with a bracelet belonging to the Scorpian King. The heavies want this as Anck-su-namum is planning on raising Imhotep again and using the Scorpian King's bracelet to rule the world. Queue the non stop action. Alex is kidnapped as he puts on the bracelet and can only remove it at the Temple belonging to the Scorpian King.
Ardeth Bey aids them in their quest. The CGI is, as you would expect superb. This time round the girls get to beef up their fight scenes. Rachel Weisz certainly can do this. The two fight scenes between her and Velazquez and excellent. Fraser proves once again that he is ideal for this sort of part.I cannot recommend this enough. GO AND SEE IT.",9,0,0,27 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The magic has started
","As one who got into the story of Harry Potter through my kids I found the books to be excellant.  I was as concerned as everyone about how well this would be translated onto the screen, (I remember 'Dune') I needn't have worried.  The film could not possibly have adapted all of the book.  The most important thing is that the film caught it's essence, it had done this and some.The film is quite simply brilliant.  The performances all shine, I have to say that my favourite is Hermione.  From the opening scenes to the final chess game you are gripped and the time flies by.  One of my favourite scenes is the Quiditch match.The story starts with Harry being left with his 'muggle' Aunt and Uncle and their son and then developes as per the book.  The scenes at the railway station and the first years arrival at Hogwarts are as magical as you imagine.  This is one for the whole family to see again and again.",10,0,0,8 December 2001
A Walk to Remember," Not standard teen fare
","I went to see this film somewhat sceptical about how good it would be,(the not another pop-star tries to be an actress syndrome).  I admit that I was suitably impressed.  This may not be in the same league as Crazy/Beautiful but it does the job better than most.  Although this contains the standard teen fare, wild child in search of redemption and uncool geek, the central performances from Moore and West plus supporting cast from Coyote and Hannah make this an enjoyable fare. Yes Moore does sing but it is all in context.  This is what Spears needed to do in Crossroads.The sound track is one to add to the collection.Ian",10,1,2,27 September 2002
