The King's Speech," Superb, with the usual gang of suspects...
","I saw this today, and it was just as good as I hoped it would be. Colin Firth should be headed for some awards, as should the rest of the familiar and excellent cast. Firth does not overly sweeten the character of George VI - he's certainly not a saint - but instead creates a character of stunningly real humanity. Indeed, I could have used a few more scenes on how Elizabeth handled her husband's temper. Geoffrey Rush is excellent, as always, as is Helena Bonham Carter in a slightly less Gothic turn than is her wont. The personal crisis of the king is so skillfully interwoven with the impending political crisis that one really feels something of what George must have felt, especially with his wastrel brother's abandoning the ship of state. YES, there is the inspiring ending you would expect, but every bit of it is earned. I recommend this movie with great enthusiasm. If only royals really looked like Colin Firth..",9,0,1,29 December 2010
Vertigo," Absolutely hypnotic
","Can't add much to what has already been said except that this movie is absolutely hypnotic, primarily due to the lush music and photography. A fourth star of the movie might be the city of San Francisco, which never looked better! Barbara Bel Geddes is also quite a standout as Midge - that look she gives Jimmy when he says that SHE broke up with HIM - what the heck is that? I've never figured it out.It's almost as if Hitch wants the audience to suspect her, too! Stewart's much-debated age works for him, I think, adding a pathos that might otherwise not be there. Bel Geddes might have thought she had the confirmed middle-aged bachelor by default, and when he thinks he's found true love, it's rather pathetic how vulnerable he becomes. My favorite Hitchcock by a mile!",10,6,7,23 February 2008
Skyfall," Made me happy!
","I have been a Bond fan since Day 1 of Dr. No, and have followed the various iterations of Bond with varying degrees of delight and/or disgust. But I'm always there for the new films. I have been so pleased with Daniel Craig's turns as Bond - even in QofS. Now all the pieces so carefully placed fall in line. This is the most 'full-on Bond' of the Craig movies. One hears familiar themes, sees familiar characters, and falls back in love with the familiar formula. AT last we have a worthy opponent again - Javier Bardem is a hoot, and almost runs away with the movie. But only almost. Craig settles into the role even better, and Judi Densch is, as usual, pitch-perfect. The movie looks as a Bond movie should - gorgeous, elegant, with every dollar right there on the screen. Shanghai is especially striking, as is an Istanbul chase with Hagia Sophia in the background. We've got a new Q and two new someone elses, all of which I think I approve. Music's good, sacrificial Bond girl appropriately hot, and my beloved Aston Martin DB is there, so I think we're all set. Go see it immediately!",10,6,15,11 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," that VOICE....
","I watched Star Trek TOS in its first run - I'm that old. And I've watched every Star Trek offering since. This was the happiest I've been with the franchise since the first Wrath of Khan! The cast has settled in nicely for a WILD ride. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, as Kirk and Spock, respectively, are far more nuanced this go-around. The look of the film is excellent and all supporting cast passable to very good. I know the action wasn't REALLY nonstop, but it seemed to be. The writing - the old switcheroo in the script - was massively clever. My only disappointment was that Benedict Cumberbatch didn't have more screen time. He is mesmerizing every time he's on. I was really hoping he'd have a big scenery-chewing barn-burning quotefest from Moby Dick, but no. To hear him say 'From hell's heart I stab at thee...' in that VOICE...",10,21,44,18 May 2013
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," This is why we have movies.
","True, as pointed out earlier, it's not Gone With the Wind, but DANG, what a great fantasy. This movie could not have been made without CGI, and I'm so glad it exists now - the movie just looks amazing. You have to wonder at all this stuff rattling around in Del Toro's head! Impossible to describe - you just really have to see it. Loved the wee Tooth Fairies! Ron Perlman delivers a solid performance, as always, and Doug Jones is a treat in multiple roles. Even the Prince was solid, and I didn't read good reviews about him. I really hope there will be a third installment. Beautiful and funny and unexpectedly touching, A summer hoot, and just great for what it aspires to be - a hero movie.",8,0,1,25 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Why? Why did this happen?
","George Lucas could make films once - why can't he now? The answer may be painfully clear now that Eps I, II, and III are out - George Lucas never COULD make films. Now, stick with me on this - he didn't have complete control over IV, V, and VI. Lawrence Kasdan wrote dialog and the was SOME limit on his special effects. It has become evident that, when George is given an unlimited budget and full writing duties, he stops writing and just plays with the computers all day long. Seriously, the movie just Bataan-Death-Marches from one long, pointless CGI sequence to the next, occasionally interspersed with truly stultifying 'political' sequences. Fun, huh? The love story sequences, such as they are, could not be more stilted and awkward. Whatever pleasant, magical nostalgia Lucas didn't ruin in The Phantom Menace, he ruins in this movie. Other folks have pointed this out, but THERE IS NO CLEAR HERO. For whom are we cheering here? Darth Vader? Obi Wan? Yoda?? This movie fails on that count alone - we can't even perform the basic act of choosing sides.",Null,0,4,20 April 2011
Van Helsing," Oh, really?
","DEFINITE SPOILER ALERT! All actors involved here hamming it up big time. OK, it's mindless fun for the most part. I even enjoyed the 007 references. There seems very little chemistry between the preternaturally attractive leads, but OK, too. I understand this movie is just camp - I really do. But can't we at least be internally consistent? Kate Beckinsale's character takes multiple slams - she falls off bridges and is repeatedly slammed HARD into stone walls, etc. by various brides, etc. But Van Helsing relatively gently knocks her onto a cushy couch and she DIES!? Come oooonnnnnnnn. And is it written in Hugh Jackman's contract that he gets an overhead shot of his holding a dead girlfriend and shouting 'NOOOO!' in every movie? Just asking.",3,2,3,25 January 2009
Clash of the Titans," Mythology - with extra cheese
","Everyone BUT the two leads (Worthington and Davalos) is just passable in this. I can't figure out all the Sam Worthington love -he's pretty bland in this and everything else. And why does HE get a buzz-cut when everyone else has long braids? Mads Mikkelson walks away with this movie, and when Fiennes and Neeson have a ham-off, it's just good, cheesy fun! The look of the film is good, with the cutest tame scorpions ever. There were a couple of shots that I knew were CGI, but really didn't look CGI, which was neat. The use of real exterior shots helped some, I think. I saw it in 2D, not 3D, which I heard was horrible-looking. Stiil, CGI cannot replace a script.Why Io instead of Athena helping Perseus? I dunno. Why Io at all? I dunno. Why are humans revolting against the gods when the gods can and do strike them with lightning? I dunno. Since they went to all the trouble to dress up a bunch of people as gods, why didn't the gods (with the exceptions of Hades and Zeus) get any lines? I dunno. Why the Norwegian kraken instead of a Greek monster? I dunno, but at least that was in the first movie. In the end, like all mythology, you just go with it and have a great time, which I did. Don't expect to learn anything substantive about Greek mythology, though.",2,3,7,2 April 2010
The Artist," Charming and effective
","I started in a different mindset than most watchers, I think, because there are some silent films that I LOVE, namely Birth of a Nation, Nosferatu, and especially Metropolis. It was odd to consider going to a new silent, but I'm SO glad I did! This movie may not be what you expect (though in many ways it's quite familiar), but it is utterly affecting. The leads are likable beyond reason, and the supporting cast is great and sometimes familiar as well. Please, people, don't write this off because it's black-and-white and/or silent. (SPOILER - it's not ALL silent, and when the director chooses to use sound, it's a shocker because one so quickly gets used to silent mode!) Some of the music will be familiar to Hitchcock fans - name that tune! I'll bet this takes some awards, and justly so. Just see it.",8,4,7,30 December 2011
Thor," OK, but not as good as it should have been
","Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character.",3,82,152,16 May 2011
The Fountain," A difficult masterpiece
","I just saw this long after all the controversy about it was over. I loved it, but can't exactly say why. I knew I wasn't being talked down to, for starters. The director doesn't do all the work for you, and I think that's what I liked best. If you want to be spoon-fed your opinions, The Fountain probably isn't a movie you'd enjoy. The movie is beautiful to look at and listen to. I haven't ever heard a soundtrack that fit a movie so well. I consider this one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I'm a bit of a film buff. It is what you make it - allegory or not. Epic without the trappings of an epic - an intimate epic if you will.",9,3,6,29 February 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Visually stunning, some liberties with the plot
","First off, this film is great to look at. I loved the way Coppola used what he called 'naive' special effects - very simple, but effective. The costumes are sheer genius, with their Kabuki overtones, thanks to the Japanese costume designer. Oldman (whose pedestrian appearance should have worked against him) gives a virtuoso (if not true to the novel) performance. But yeah...then there's Keanu Reeves. What was Coppola thinking? He ruins every scene in which he opens his mouth. Winona Ryder is not much better in the accent department, but she's a better actor than Reeves, so she gets away with it. Have to admit, I don't always get Sir Anthony's take on Van Helsing...getting seduced by Mina? No, I don't think so. I'm a big fan of the book, but this is one of my favorite movie versions. The other? The little-seen Louis Jordan version.",7,0,1,22 November 2009
Prometheus," Oddly, I liked it...
","...and I agree with almost all the complaints about idiot plot points!This movie is so beautiful and asks such big questions that I found it easy to forgive or ignore the fact that the main characters acted very, very stupidly and/or improbably at times. I am a sucker for Ridley Scott's visuals, though - I always have been. But gosh, he blows the roof off with this one. Never has a movie (except maybe 2001) made me feel more insignificant. Scott just nails space and the alien planet. I'm not sure how I feel about the appearance of the Engineers, but I think I'm kind of OK with it - at least I can't think of a look I'd prefer. The scene with David at the controls of the Engineer ship was just magical to me. When I heard this was going to be a prequel to Alien, I was alarmed, since I consider Alien just about a perfect movie, right up there with Jaws. I am perfectly satisfied that not every 'i' was dotted and every 't' crossed. I'm actually happy that the ending of this movie does NOT fit perfectly with the beginning of Alien. Again, I invoke 2001 - not EVERYTHING has to be explained. I prefer the mystery. The cast...hmmm. I could almost see Scott straining for the same mix of working stiffs with higher eschelons that he had in Alien. Did not love Guy Pierce at all. Noomi Rapace photographs very oddly at times, but I think she was acceptable. The whole cast is just so overshadowed by the film itself, I almost tend to forget them. I did very much like Michael Fassbender's turn as the android David. What a little Pinocchio he was. His performance was ALMOST ruined by some bad writing/inexplicable action, but it turned out OK. The story is basically compelling, but would have been much better served with competent and more realistic character development. Everything everyone says about stupid character actions is true - unprofessional behavior from supposed professionals, inexplicable mood swings, yep, all of it. It just didn't bother me as much because these people are just amoebas in the face of what they find, anyway.I liked Scott's take on religion as well. It has become quite the style of late to discount religion or reduce it to the products of simple minds. I like that smart people in this movie still 'choose to believe.' My biggest gripe? Same as everyone else's - the c-section. No matter HOW many drugs one takes, action will simply not be happening after that. She should have been flattened by the drugs alone. But I got over it. One more thing - this movie just MIGHT be more like Blade Runner than it is like Alien.",8,4,7,16 October 2012
X-Men: First Class," Extremely well-done
","Having sat through Wolverine, I wondered if this franchise was doomed, but this movie was a pleasant surprise. The direction was witty and well-paced. I know it's odd to point out the set design, but it was FABULOUS. There is a definite 60's- James-Bond-Bad-Guy-Lair vibe to some of the sets, and it's quite fun. George Lucas could take a few lessons from this director about how and when to use CGI. The CGI enhances, but never dominates the story. The fights weren't SO protracted that you started wondering when they would be over. Standouts in the cast were, of course, McAvoy and Fassbinder. I had never seen McAvoy in anything before, and he certainly delivers the goods in the charm department. Who knew Xavier was such a smoothie with the ladies? And Fassbinder is one to watch - not only is he wonderfully easy on the eyes, but his acting in this role carried a welcome and dangerous intensity that was definitely called for. (He did seem to get very Irish near the end of the movie, though.) January Jones as Emma Frost is a hoot - just watching her deadpan around in one outrageous 60's outfit after another is pretty funny, and again, sort of a Bond throwback. One thing bothered me a little - Kevin Bacon as the villain. He's really not bad, but he's not a good enough actor to make me forget that he's Kevin Bacon. All the young 'uns were respectively good, and seemed to be having fun. The audience did too. Nice job all around.",8,2,5,4 June 2011
Ben-Hur," Pick one movie...
","If I were forced at gunpoint to pick one favorite movie, it would probably be Ben Hur. Sure, it's an epic spectacle, and I love that aspect of it, but it also has some surprisingly intimate moments as well. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? It looks great, it sounds great, the acting is superb on all counts, and the screenplay is genius. I saw one reviewer complain about the 'flowery dialog,' but that was by design. Christopher Fry was brought in to prettify the screenplay after Gore Vidal had his way with it, and I think Fry added just the right amount of archaisms to set the mood. Miklos Rosza's score is perfect - the best one he ever did, I think, and that's saying quite a bit! This movie has a beauty that CGI will never attain, though I know there are quite a few practical effects in it. And the actors - I really can't think of a weak performance in the movie. Haya Harareet is just luminous, and I never saw her in anything else. Charlton Heston never looked, acted, or sounded better. I can't imagine anyone else's having the heroic stature to carry this role. They don't make 'em like Chuck anymore. This movie is a cultural icon - if you haven't seen it, do so immediately.",10,2,5,25 November 2009
Casino Royale," Hooray from the biggest Bond nerd ever
","I was all ready to hate this movie, having been a Bond fan since I was very young and walked to the neighborhood theater to watch Dr. No for 50 cents. Bond movies have always meant escape and pretty clothes and exotic locales and handsome, handsome men! Neither the script, locales, nor Bond disappointed here. Craig appears fully capable of carrying the role for many years to come. His take on Bond is as a tough little wiseacre bulldog, which is a refreshing change from the broad comedy the series sometimes veered into. I see that a lot of hard-core Bond fans don't like this movie because it's missing one or several parts of the 'Bond formula' that they liked. No gadgets, no small talk, etc. Well, this IS a reboot - they're starting over. He won't get gadgets until later, and he won't get snarky until later. Patience, people.I liked the shower scene best - you felt like Bond wasn't just using the girl, which again, seems to be the case in a lot of the films. Highly recommended.",9,1,5,18 February 2010
Beowulf," Just could not be more bad...
","Any comment on this movie that starts 'Good, but...' is DEAD WRONG. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Yes, I am familiar with and indeed teach the book. But I was prepared for digressions. I can't even enjoy the primal act of looking at this movie. It looks like a cartoon or video game. Is that supposed to be good? I found it annoying at best, downright disturbing at worst. The 'acting' consists of a bunch of guys hollering. Even Sir Anthony does not come off well. John Malkovich seems to be on tranquilizers. Ray Winstone leaps about naked in what is quite manifestly not his own naked body. And why naked? I don't know - he's supposed to be UNARMED. I know the whole Angelina Jolie thing has already been covered, but DANG. She's supposed to be a hideous monster - not even close. Grendel looks like Dobby in the Harry Potter movies - hardly horrifying. Everyone commented on the effects, but I found them kind of dreadful. It's unintentionally funny, if that's what you're going for.",1,11,20,23 March 2008
