Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
","zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - Oh, I'm sorry! I must have dozed off. I was watching Star Wars: the Phantom Menace. If you want to get some deep sleep, see George Lucas' latest installment of the Star Wars saga. There is not a single aspect of this film that held my interest, not even the special effects. As is the case with all computer generated effects, they got boring after a couple minutes. I hope Mr. Lucas reads these comments, because if this is the direction he's headed in, his gold mine is going to run dry. A TRADE FEDERATION?! Give me a break!! I've seen Congressional meetings more interesting than Dennis the Phantom Menace!",Null,0,1,22 September 1999
