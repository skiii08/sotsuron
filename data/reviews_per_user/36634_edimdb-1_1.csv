Spartacus," great commentary on DVD
","I think the movie is quite good; what I want to add to the comments already made is just this: The commentary (on the DVD) by screenplay writer Dalton Trumbo is great. Kirk Douglas said it was the greatest analysis of film-making ever. He explains the purpose of every scene, very openly and honestly critiquing the changes the actors made, for (in his estimation) better or worse.There is another track of commentary by the actors. The actors had an unusual degree of latitude in re-writing their lines and forming their characters.",9,44,74,7 September 2005
