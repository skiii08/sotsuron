Joker," Nice performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but nut quite on the level of Heath Ledger
","THe movie is good, but not as good as some of the reviews here could make you think. There are some boring parts, long sequences that should have been cut shorter.
Joaquin is good, great even, but Heath Legdge's Joker is leagues better.
The ending is very predictable, and the movie begin to be entertaining after the middle.
Don't go in with high expectations like me, you'd be disappointed.",Null,5,13,7 October 2019
