The Ring," Did anyone else notice...
","Somewhat disappointing as it was slow at times, but overall a 7 out of 10 (in my opinion).  I do have one question for everyone.Right after the horse on the ferry scene, did anyone else notice a 'glitch' or maybe a subliminal shot of 'the ring' for a split second?  I hadn't noticed any comments on this in this group, but I played back the dvd, and noticed it every time.  I thought this might be a problem with the dvd, so I rented it again, and noticed the same thing.  It's very quick, and you have to really be paying attention, but it's there.  Maybe it's just my TV, or maybe I'll die in seven days, but take a look.  Did the director put this there on purpose?  Was this just a glitch, or did I see what I thought I saw?",Null,0,0,17 April 2003
