Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," good, but could have been better.
","I never saw the original films, as i wasn't born then and so i never really grew up with star wars. I knew they existed but no more than that really. So when first watching this film as an 11 year old, i liked the fact that this was an exciting and watchable film. With hindsight, i can see that Jar Jar binks is extremely annoying and there is much dialogue that has been done before. It has brilliant action scenes, particularly the pod race and the battle at the end. Of course, the light sabre battles are well done and this contributes to the over all feel of a good star wars film. As a film i think it is very good, and is well worth watching. But, i can see why this doesn't appeal to hardcore fans as it does detract slightly from the original films. But i was excited watching it as an 11 year old and i would gladly watch it again.",7,0,1,11 May 2005
Titanic," you call this rubbish an excuse for a film?!
","Even if i tried for a million years, i could not make this film worse. But stick a robot and a giant llama in and hey, you've got a decent film. It's good when the main character dies at the end, but the other one doesn't because she gets to experience the same kind of trauma i went through by sticking with watching it. The plot is absolutely awful, the scriptwriters evidently have no imagination, and at 3 hours, i would literally rather watch my cat sleeping. the actual best part is the theme song at the credits, no only joking, that's as bad as the film is. anyway, if you have 3 hours to kill, do something else, this is absolute tripe.",1,7,15,4 May 2005
War of the Worlds," Damn good
","When i walked into the cinema, i was expecting a slightly more subtle and more thought provoking type of film. Essentially, i expected it to be quite boring. On the contrary, this is an excellent film, with a tense plot, brilliant special effects and above average acting. Maybe sitting in the front row (about 3 inches from the screen) made everything louder, but still, the way the tri pods moved and destroyed whole towns was captivating, i couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Spielberg has an amazing way of making you clench the seat as though you're hanging out of the top window of a 20 storey building, and he uses this so effectively that you pay attention to the emotional parts of the film as well as the jaw dropping action scenes. Admittedly you can see similarities with independence day or other apocalyptic thrillers, but this is infinitely better than smith's predictable clich√©-filled multi-million pound vessel for instilling yet more American nationalistic pride in the public. Comedic moments are used sparsely to occasionally lighten the mood, a particular line i enjoyed occurs when Cruise's son asks where the machines are coming from (he believes they're terrorists from the middle east), cruise replies 'no, they're from somewhere else', 'what, Europe?'. The film has been tailored for a post 9/11 audience clearly, but this gives the film a more realistic edge, as we recognise intertextual references such as these, making it seem like it could happen. Although i can see a couple of plot holes which need explaining. For example, the madman says that the aliens have been planning this for a million years, suggesting that the machines they had placed here had been here before we were. Therefore, what's the point in placing machines to take over the world when there's no one to fight a million years ago. despite these, you won't notice too much discrepancy and the film is as i said a masterpiece among other average modern apocalyptic movies.",8,2,6,3 July 2005
Casino Royale," A great film; a good Bond film.
","I can understand that many die-hard Bond fans may not enjoy this perhaps as much as the previous ones. But it is an excellent film nonetheless, and i think it's an excellent Bond film. It's got everything a bond film needs:-Bond girls - Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is the hottest thing alive. no exceptions. -Cars - the A.M of course. -Action - the chase and fighting is second to none.But not only that, there is such magnificent wit that made me laugh out loud literally - Along with most others in the cinema.Anyone that says this has no humour in it was clearly not watching the same film i was. It does indeed differ in style and theme from the last film, but it takes Bond in a slightly new direction for once. And i find it refreshing to say the least. The opening grimy black and white perfectly reflects Ian Fleming's 1950's depiction of Bond's world. then we're met with jaw dropping chase scenes to bring us into the present.I suggest you give this a chance. Even you don't take it as a Bond film and on it's own merits, it's still a brilliant ride.",8,0,1,26 November 2006
