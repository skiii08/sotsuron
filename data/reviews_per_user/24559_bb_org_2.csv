Spartacus," Still relevant after all these years
","A very moving and compelling story of epic proportions. The plot is relentless, propelled by a dazzling screenplay. Kubrick draws some of the greatest performances of the cast, and fills the screen with images that fascinate throughout. Well paced for a movie of this magnitude.To those who complain of anachronisms and poetic license with historical events, I say to them, 'Remember, it is a movie.' To be truly accurate, the cast would be delivering their lines in Latin and ancient Greek, with English subtitles. Whatever Kubrick might lose with historical inaccuracies, he gains far more in his ability to convey the story to the viewer. Even though it is over forty years old, the film tells us more of the present day than it does of the past.",10,48,65,26 December 2005
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Couldn't Finish It
","I started to watch this movie with high hopes. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I expected this movie to have a story that was reasonably well-scripted with character development and complex plot elements. Call me dense, but I found none of those in this film.To begin with, the trope of a dying woman from the Old South (former Confederate States to those of you from outside the US) telling a story of her life was done better with True Grit and The Oldest Confederate Widow Tells All.The adaptation of Fitzgerald's work is a travesty. The early part moves slowly, and shuffles along, pardon what might some might find as a slur on the Southern stereotypes offered for popular consumption. After about an hour and a half, I decided it was not worth it.I tried to watch the rest of the movie the following night, but lost whatever plot there might have been. Adapting a short story into a movie nearly three hours long does not make sense.I am looking forward to a decent adaptation of Times Arrow by Martin Amis.",4,2,3,6 May 2014
