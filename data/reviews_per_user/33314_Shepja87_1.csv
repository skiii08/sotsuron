Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Above all else, don't take this too seriously
","OK, one thing people really don't get about KB1&2 is that it's not meant to be taken seriously. One woman who wrote on this film complained about how blood spurting out is not realistic. This is because these films are more of a tribute to the old Kung Fu films, camera styles, gore, costumes, etc. Scene's are pinched from odd films and recreated. This is Tarintino's homage to those films, don't see this as some highly original film, because it's been done before, in more ways than one.This film is good, if you're knowledgeable (SP) enough to appreciate it.",8,0,3,21 March 2006
