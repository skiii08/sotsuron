The Avengers," Seriously?
","OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SOOOO BLOWN AWAY! THAT MOVIE WAS PERFECT! Sound familiar? Of course it does. Everyone seems to be in love with this movie. I don't know why, though.The action was nearly flawless, I will admit that. It looked very real and must have been among one of the most expensive movies of all time. However, action is not enough to convince me to be in love with a movie. What's number 1 on IMDb.com's top 250 movies of all time list? The Shawshank Redemption. Why is that movie so good? (Sorry if you aren't a huge fan of that movie). It was good because of the story line. The great acting. The great cast. There is not one action scene in that movie. Yet it is so good. I feel as though people like and/or love The Avengers for the opposite reason. The story wasn't exactly BAD or anything but I can't find anything special about it.Right from the very beginning- BOOM! Loki just happens to appear from Lord knows where. I love the idea of assembling a team of Super Powered People (super heroes) to form The Avengers. Great. I just feel like I could have predicted the entire movie. I expected Loki to appear, wreak havoc. The Avengers to assemble, all of them having lots of disagreements. Then in the blink of an eye they would work together and beat Loki in a huge battle. And where will this battle take place? NEW YORK!!!! How original!The acting was good, except I just can't stand Loki, or Tom Hiddleston, or both, I don't even know. I just think he is very annoying and not even close to a good villain. I find myself so unafraid of Loki while guys like The Joker or Bane or Venom scare me to death if I were ever to encounter them in real life (if they were real people).It was just very bland to me, there were some very funny moments and some moments that were very good action scenes. Doesn't mean I give this movie a 10 it doesn't deserve like other people. The fact that it is somewhere along the lines of an 8.2 just disappoints me big time. I would've expected like a 7.5-7.8. I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250.I do like this movie, you can see I gave it 7 stars. As I said the acting, cast, and action is very good. But that doesn't mean the story line, predictability or the main villain is any good at all.All I can say is I've seen better hero movies.",7,6,13,25 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Absolutely better than the first Spider Man
","Before I say why this was better, let me say that I DID enjoy the first Spider-Man trilogy, a lot.I loved this movie because it goes so deep into Peter Parker.The relationship between him and Gwen is great, and its very real. I loved the ending, where (*SPOILER*) he said that promises that can't be kept are the best kind, basically hinting to Gwen that he wanted to be with her regardless of him being Spider-Man. I loved that.While I am not a huge fan of The Lizard, I thought they did a pretty good job with using him as a villain. I'm not sure why, I just liked it.I give this an 8 because I was not WOWed by it (like The Dark Knight). Although I very much did enjoy it.",8,2,6,8 July 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Wow, I was surprised...
","Before I give my explanation why it was a 9, let me first say that I have not seen the original Planet of the Apes. I never really thought about seeing it, it always looked dumb to me, because back then, technology was awful, so there were just men in monkey masks talking.Anyway, this movie really caught me off guard.I knew I wanted to see it, when I saw trailers for it, I thought 'Hmm... that could be decent, maybe I'll see it.'So then it came out on DVD. I rented it, and I watched it, expecting it to be a good film, maybe worth a 7/10.WOW, I was wrong. This movie wasn't INCREDIBLE, but it was very well done. If they did a Planet of the Apes remake to sequel this movie, I would watch it, no doubt.Everything about this movie was very good, even the music. The music was rather intense to say the least. Anyway, James Franco did a good job as usual, (see Spider-Man 1-3, Pineapple Express, 127 Hours, etc.)I thought the concept of a chimp raised in a house with humans, then brought to an abusive shelter, then eventually leading other chimps to revenge was great. I'm not sure why, but I loved it.I'm not sure that there could have been another way to make this movie as good as it was without using that specific concept. It was great.Then in the credits, you think, wait, so how do they take over the WORLD? Well, they show you with a visual in the credits that has the 1 infected human taking a flight to Europe, and the disease spreads, which will wipe out humans, leaving chimps to rule.Very good movie, 9/10.",9,1,2,12 July 2012
Evil Dead," Eh... Almost had me.
","Well, I suppose it was worth the money to see it. Very good visual movie in my opinion.There were multiple problems though throughout.Scary? Not at all. I went into the movie fully expecting to jump at least a good two times. The tagline is 'The most terrifying movie you will ever experience'. So why wasn't it scary? Creepy is another thing. Every demon in the movie looked downright freaky and creepy. But that doesn't matter when they don't do anything to build quality suspense or cause a jump scare. This wasn't necessarily one of those movies where I'd be all like 'and the (enter ghost, demon, monster, etc.) is gonna pop up in 3, 2, 1... It wasn't THAT predictable, but it was somewhat, and that annoys me.I suppose the acting was okay, nothing really great though, but nothing really bad. That's kind of typical in horror movies though I guess.One thing that REALLY bothered me throughout the movie though, is that I didn't give one single crap about any of the characters, except maybe the guy with the long hair (the one who opened the book), and that was only because he kept living when he should have died early. The main character, Mia, was a possessed demon for a majority of the movie. The thing is: I didn't care. I couldn't have cared any less if she just died in the movie, I mean seriously. The characters were not at all built up in a way that any could be loved or cherished.Now onto some more things I did like.The gore. While I thought a little too much was put into the film, all of it was well done. It looked real, some of it even put an uncomfortable look on my face due to it's realism.Music was good too. Not much to say.Things that need to be revised.Length. This movie just felt ridiculously short. 91 minutes? It felt like an hour. I've watched movies twice as long. Ever see Titanic?The very ending. It must not have been good because I can't even remember what happened right before the credits. I literally can't even remember.While I've never seen the original 'The Evil Dead' directed by Sam Raimi, I'm sure it has a good chance of being better than this movie.Overall, average movie, yet better than Woman in Black or Mama or other dumb horror movies.",6,2,14,15 April 2013
The Dark Knight," The Best Hero Movie of all time!!!!!!
","Nolan has done it again, with arguably his best work ever! I must say first, I am not a comic book reader, nor have I ever been. Although I like some heroes more than others, I am not a very big Batman fan, either. I just never thought he was that special or a good superhero, more like a rich man with armor and guns. While I was never a big fan of Batman, I am a HUGE fan of The Dark Knight!!! This movie was perfect, nothing short of perfect. First off, I tip my hat to the late Heath Ledger for his flawless performance of the Joker. Second, Christopher Nolan has shined once again. I saw this in theaters and when I left, I was amazed. Not only was the overall movie very well paced and interesting, the ending was perfect: Batman took the wrap for Two-Face's crimes so Gotham could keep their hero, while Batman became the enemy. Truly incredible.Even the music was great..Hans Zimmer never fails, his music was great in Inception, too (also a Nolan movie).I didn't think the sequel to Batman Begins would be as good, I was wrong, it was 5x better!If you want a movie that is serious, but also exciting and amazing, The Dark Knight should be at the top of your list.10/10, truly a great all time movie.",10,3,6,6 July 2012
Saw," Fantastic, refreshing change of pace from unoriginal horror films.
","I'd like to start by stating one of the very few things that bothers me about this movie. When I look at it, and see the word 'genre', and look to the right of it and see the word, 'horror'.Let's face it, this movie's main goal was not to scare. It was to leave viewers of the movie guessing.This movie is far, very, very far from typical. Two men wake up in a disgusting bathroom, each chained to a rusty pipe by their ankles. Oh yeah, and there's a dead body between them. From that very situation in the beginning, I was interested in the plot.We find more details about the movie throughout. We learn about the 'Jigsaw' killer. Although he isn't a killer at all. Is he?No...he isn't.He finds ungrateful people, and puts them in a situation for them to earn their lives. Which they are all very capable of doing. But not everyone succeeds.We get an in-depth look at Detective Tapp (played very well by Danny Glover) and his obsession with finding the man known as Jigsaw.To say the very least this movie was suspenseful and thrilling. Not scary, nor was it supposed to be.The acting was good, not fantastic or anything, but quite good. I believed all the characters. The camera-work, screenplay, script, and directing were all very good as well. Don't even get me started on the music. That was great.The ending may or may not blow you away. I was shocked to say the least, and as I've said, this is a great change of pace from typical movies.10/10. Great plot, great suspense, great mystery, great music, great ending.",10,0,1,12 April 2013
Inception," I can't believe there are people who don't like this..
","Honestly, what isn't there to like?DiCaprio is at his best in this movie, even better than he was in Titanic, Shutter Island, Catch Me If You Can, etc.This is my favorite movie by Christopher Nolan, I like it just a little more than The Dark Knight.There are many people who hate this movie because they think it makes stupid people 'feel smart'. I say that they must be stupid people if they think that.This movie wasn't meant to make people feel smart, it was meant to be different, and it was. No other movie has done something like this, it WAS brilliant, not stupid, brilliant.It is deserving of its spot on the Top 250...what is it like 14 or something? It is a great movie, personally my favorite ever, and yes I have seen Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, The Dark Knight and other classics.This movie is a very good use of science fiction and great acting.I think a very under rated actor is Ellen Page who played Ariadne. Not to mention Tom Hardy as Eaves. I also believe Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job as Arthur.Honestly people, what is your issue? Some people are just too picky or too hard to please, this movie was excellent, I do not care what others say.An easy 10/10.",10,4,9,8 July 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Deserving of the #1 spot on the top 250.
","'Salvation lies within.' -Warden Norton to Andy.I do not believe there is such a thing as a perfect movie. However, this, it is a masterpiece.I was not even alive when this movie was released. I didn't know of it until maybe four years ago. Since then, I have seen this movie multiple times and honestly, I don't get tired of it. This is among the most powerful stories ever told in a film. Ever. This movie is simply about friendship. The friendship that takes form over roughly 20 years in a Maine prison. One man, is in prison for murder. He is guilty. However, his friend, is not guilty. An innocent man is placed in prison for two life sentences for a crime he did not commit.Red (played masterfully by Morgan Freeman)is the guilty man, while Andy Dufresne (played wonderfully by Tim Robbins) is the innocent man.The two of them show remarkable chemistry. They pull this off simply by talking to each other throughout the movie. Usually when I see a trailer for a movie today, there's explosions, or a natural disaster or gang wars or something. This movie consists almost 99.9999999% simple talking. And its done to perfection.With a well done script, terrific acting, and a very good ending, this movie will forever be among the greatest ever.There are countless moments in this movie where you feel moved, inspired, or you feel that you've learned something.I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. A true masterpiece.",10,1,2,20 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Christopher Nolan has done it yet again....
","That was so good. I am writing this just after seeing the movie. And I am blown away. It lived up to the hype by far. And I thought it would be kind of upsetting without Heath Ledger in the movie. I barely noticed he wasn't in the movie. Don't get me wrong I love The Dark Knight and Batman Begins. I just thought it would be a little too weird without him as The Joker.I don't think Bane made the movie like The Joker did, however Bane was really good in this movie. I almost thought Batman was gonna lose. i just think Nolan did great as usual and the cast did great.The one thing I didn't like about this movie is that Alfred was practically removed from this movie in the first 30 minutes, only to bring him back for the last 2 minutes. Other than that, there wasn't much to dislike.I couldn't help but stand up and clap when the movie was over. Yeah it is better than Batman Begins, and yeah it is better than The Dark Knight.Also I'm not sure why people are complaining about the ending to the movie. Honestly,I didn't love the ending but it was pretty good. They made it seem as though John Blake would become Robin, and fight for Gotham, which was a good ending in my opinion. The Dark Knight had a better ending.I give this a 10, if I could give it a 59, I would. Watch this movie, its so good.",10,2,6,20 July 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," It was different....
","Now I want to first state that so called 'horror movies' over the last 10 years have been consistently awful. I never find myself scared. I saw The Woman In Black in theaters when it came out, and literally me and my friend were just making jokes during the whole movie about it. I didn't jump once during that movie despite the loud BANG noises that would pop up. Now this movie I did not see in theaters, I rented it, and saw it with that same friend I saw WiB with.Did I expect this movie to be scary? Well, no, but that's because no movie is scary anymore, not even the highly touted Paranormal Activity movies that people seem to be scared of. This movie just seemed like it would be an easy to grade movie. I thought just by the sound of the movie, it would be worth a 2 out of 10.I mean, think about it. Five friends alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. The jock, the burnout, the home wrecker, the scholar, and the closest thing to a virgin. TYPICAL, right?WRONG. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!This movie ended up being quite interesting due to the plot. We later find out in the movie that it is all a set-up. Also, the five friends basically have the power to decide what creature comes and kills them off one by one. Interesting, right?In the first hour of this movie, it looks to be a totally typical horror film. I mean really typical. Everyone seems to be dying quickly. However, two of them happen to live, and they discover the headquarters for the people rigging the game. Chaos seems to break loose throughout and the riggers get a little taste of their own medicine, and to make a long story short, everyone ends up dying. Like, everyone...on the planet.The acting was all right, nothing to hate or love if you ask me. And I found a few parts in this movie to be quite funny.Do I HONESTLY believe this is a 10???? No I do not. I simply wanted to bring the rating up from a 7.3 because I think it deserves a 7.5 or 7.6. Overall, much better than the typical horror films.",7,0,2,29 September 2012
