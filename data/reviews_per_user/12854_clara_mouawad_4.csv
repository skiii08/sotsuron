The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Just amazing !
","i read the book 4 years ago. and i didn't understand well the last book 'mockingjay' I've been watching hunger games movies and i like them. so when this movie was in cinemas, i went to watch it, expecting to understand nothing exactly like the last book. instead i was speechless . the movie is amazing , literally amazing. It made me understand everything i wasn't able to understand in the book! i think it's the first movie i like more than its book. in the book it was just words who didn't make sense. in the movie everything was clear and exciting it's really wow how the actress can act that she can't act or that she act that she's not acting. it's really wonderful to watch it and it deserve the time and money to watch it. I LIKE IT A LOT.",9,17,48,29 November 2014
The Maze Runner," shame , lame , stupid movie
","THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. I've read the book in 2 days and i can say it's amazing! then i decided to watch the movie. I was expecting something totally different. i was shocked when i watched it and here are the differences between book and movie: 1- the Gladers have been 2 years in the maze not 3 years. 2- when first this whole maze thing began, a group was send to the maze not only Alby who the movie says he was sent alone at first. 3- Teresa and Thomas speaks telepathy, and it's very important in the book. instead the movie didn't say anything about it. 4- before Teresa wake from her coma she speaks telepathically to Tomas telling him her last memories before fading. 5- what was this stuff in the movie which has the number 7 written on it? nothing like that in the book 6- in the book, when the runners come back from their runs they draw the map of the day. 7- when Thomas and Minho were stuck in the maze the night, Minho didn't help Thomas with Alby instead he ran away 8- the movie says nothing about the cliff neither about the hole that Thomas and Minho found when they were stuck the night out chasing the Grievers. this hole is the exit of the maze, were the Gladers in the book left the maze. 9- the maps that the runners have drew were the key to the code to open the door inside the hole. in the movie Thomas just remembered the code which was a set of numbers (in the book it was words) 10- when the door didn't close at night Gally was being controlled by WICKED and told the Gladers that the grievers will kill one person a night (not all the Gladers in the same night!!) 11- when they succeeded to pass the door out of the glade, there wasn't any video tape!!instead people came and rescued them from WICKED and took them away. 12- when Gally killed Chuck, it wasn't Minho who killed him! instead it was Thomas who punched him hard in the face but he sure as hell didn't die! 13- nothing in the book about Chuck having a rock from his mom! 14- Alby died in the night when they were leaving the glade, trying to be helpful he gave himself to the grievers thinking that they may leave the others alone since the message was that the grievers takes a person a night. 15- Thomas went to a griever to get stung on purpose to remember. (in the movie he just stung himself) If i want i can find THOUSAND more mistakes in the movie! i can say that the movie was all a mistake. Instead of spending your money and wasting your time watching this movie , i advise you to buy the book and read it because it's amazing. nothing like the movie. THE MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.",2,2,5,29 November 2014
Divergent," amazing
","i watched the movie before reading the book all i can tell is that the movie and the book are amazing ! there is differences between book and movie but they aren't bad . 1- in the book , the way to stop the effect of the simulation is mental but in the movie it's physical 2- Tris never get out of the dauntless and then get in but that was a good idea 3- they didn't mention Al . i didn't like that 4- Tris is not beautiful nor pretty but in the movie she is pretty 5- in the end they never obliged Jeanine to stop the simulation but they did it on their own . in fact i liked this idea in the movie. i think it's the first movie that i liked the differences in it .",9,0,1,12 May 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," excellent
","when i read the book i rated it 4/5 for a reason: i really really liked the books but in my opinion there is a lot of philosophy that can be removed . meanwhile, i watched the movie and i can say it's amazing : it's the first movie i like more than the book . usually i don't like the movies because they are nothing compared to the books . but this is an exception: the movie is so much like the book, nothing new is created . it's typically like the book but the only difference is that in the movie they have deleted a lot of the philosophy i didn't like and they kept the amazing ones . so it's worth a 10/10 and it's the first movie i rated it more than the book",10,0,1,3 July 2014
