3:10 to Yuma," The Most Beautiful Aspect of This Film is Easily Missed
","Westerns are by their nature allegorical territory. But this film hides away a secret that if you're not careful, you may miss. I picked up the clues somewhat by accident, but as the film unfolded I began to more fully understand the Russell Crowe character and the Christian Bale character in a way that made the film impossible to misinterpret. Fathers almost always want the best for their sons. They want to protect them from harm, disappointment and loss. But in the final analysis, when everything else is taken away, even a bad father wants his son to have someone in his life he can count on, someone worth looking up to. In the final moments, when a father knows that the only things he's given his progeny are the worst parts of himself, and he has an opportunity to give him something truly good he'll do anything to provide that gift. Even when his nature is to destroy everything that matters to him. How could a man, who by every measure is a failure, not be a hero when he stands as a giant in the eyes of the boy he calls a son? Who could ask for a better father than the man that walked Ben Wade to the train station when no one else would? A man could not ask for a better Father for his son than that.",9,2,4,14 September 2007
Hostel," Takes a while to get to the scary
","I really wanted to like this one more. I have enormous respect and admiration for the people who made it. Strictly speaking, It took what felt like a long time to get to the point of the film. I've heard of the underground murder industry and believe me that is a scary world. I enjoyed the lead up to the midway point in the film, but it felt like two different movies. Without much connective tissue between them. I also didn't feel empathy for the characters in the film that fall into jeopardy. It's probably because we spend so much time with them before the danger shows up that we realize that they're not that likable. I think we see too much of them and their juvenile behavior and it just wore thin. Kinda like nails on a chalkboard, for me at least. When the terror arrived, like a train late to the station, I guess I was too tired from standing, waiting on it, to enjoy the ride. I hope Hostel 2 is more successful in these tricky areas. And Hostel 3D... and Hostel 4: The Beginning... and Hostel V: Hotel Hell... and Hostel 7: Prey 2 Heaven!... and Hostel Ocho: Dark Night of the Gringos...",6,0,0,23 July 2006
Silent Hill," Doesn't live up to the trailer
","I did not know that Silent Hill was first a video game until a couple of days before I saw it. However, the trailer alone was enough of an incentive to plunk down $20 for two tickets. I would pay the filmmakers $40 more dollars to get back the two hours of my life they took from me. It seems that for all the 'edgy' and extreme imagery that the filmmakers had at their disposal, not one frame of this film was the least bit scary. I sat in a theater in Burbank, CA, on day two of the release in an auditorium that was half full and at least half the audience howled in fits of (unintentional) laughter. Some of the situations in the film are so ham-handed that they elicited giggles from the audience because they were so ridiculous. I'm waiting two weeks for this thing to open, thinking I'm going to see some scary stuff and this movie is remarkable for the utter lack of any scenes or imagery that is dread-inducing. There were at least five walk-outs in the first thirty minutes and I hardly ever see that when I go to the movies. I will give the movie this kudo; the concept artists they hired to design their creatures was money well spent. But instead of seeing this movie, I think I would have rather browsed the artist's portfolios looking at their concept designs for two hours. Better luck next time...",4,0,4,23 April 2006
The Polar Express," Tom falls into the 'Uncanny Valley'
","In short, this film tells a great story. I would give some weight however to the gentleman that put forth the theory about population control and fascism when the train arrives at the north pole. That argument at least sounds interesting. But my problem with this film lies along a different path. I had a difficult time watching the film without becoming nauseous. My principle reaction to the look of the characters was revulsion. This is a fantastic example of when not to use computer animation. It would have been fine to turn the people into cute animals or caricatures, but photo real looking CGI people that talk and act in medium shots and close-ups are nothing more than animated cadavers. At least that's how our brains see them. I saw the film in 3D, which I'm sure amplified my natural and innate instinct to reject the characters, as one would reject a fresh corpse.",4,1,3,14 December 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," I loved this film. Clooney and Spacey were particularly hilarious
","The story borrows liberally from the exploits of Joe McMoneagle and Ingo Swann and the cadré of Remote Viewers stationed at Fort Meade, MD, under the operational detachment Project Stargate. Yes, as the film states upfront: 'More of this is true than you would believe'. There are instances in the film that incorporate actual Stargate operations: tracking submarines, finding a kidnapped American General in Italy and the search for Noriega following the US invasion of Panama. The comedy comes from the disconnect that the professional military hierarchy has from the rest of us. The Pentagon has too much money at its disposal and its internal political dynamics encourage a bizarre mixture of risk-averse yet forward-thinking innovators. This was particularly rampant after our loss in Vietnam. Vietnam and the Cold War combined to pull the Pentagon Brass in a thousand different directions and created a schism in the strategic planning sectors that is ripe for comedic exploration. Grant Heslov deftly captured this cultural watershed through his direction of the film. He ably guided the actors in performances that while sometimes brief, captured the totality of the real absurdity that the military can sometimes give us, while keeping the characters real and grounded and not drifting into farce. Heslov has captured an elusive tone, entirely his own, that I've only previously seen in Coen Brother's films. This is a story I've longed to see told on the big screen and it was worth the wait. You could say its a story about the Military-Insanity Complex, but that's too broad a brush for this slice of American military history. Clooney is brilliantly understated as always, he's a master of subtlety and an actor that understands how powerful the camera can be. Kevin Spacey is throughly despicable as the film's only real villain. If the film has any flaws at all its that Spacey is not in it enough. But the most poignant character is beautifully drawn by Jeff Bridges, who in just a few scenes depicts the inevitable trajectory of the innovative free-thinker in a rigid, uncaring system. Bridges shows us the cost of being that individual and Heslov gives the film room to explore this aspect of the story without sacrificing the reason we're all there to watch: and that is to have a laugh at something that maybe should never have happened but did.",8,33,43,7 November 2009
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A Hidden Treasure
","I saw the trailer to this film online and it seemed like a funny - yet unsustainable premise. I went to see it with friends anyway and I can't remember laughing so hard at a film in years. This movie takes a promising premise and knocks it out of the park. The cast is superb in this send-up of the psycho in the woods genre and the writing and direction take what I feared was an unsustainable premise and they give it surprising energy and humor. This is not Scary Movie crap. This is inventive and fresh and it has a beautiful heart. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk are the 'Hillbillies' in this hilarious tale of prejudice and paranoia and they deliver performances that are grounded and authentic. Tucker and Dale never become plodding stereotypes of ignorant rednecks. They are portrayed with great wit and dignity and the actors never overreach or retreat into the safety and insecurity of broad camp. The cast trusts the writing and the director and it pays off. The script by Morgan Jurgenson and director Eli Craig is tight, smart and has a wonderful heart. These qualities are given life by an above average cast that includes the lovely Katrina Bowden from NBC's 30 Rock. An especially guilty pleasure is the character of Chad, brilliantly played by Jesse Moss who channels some alternate universe version of a sociopathic Tom Cruise as the lead frat-boy. Eli Craig really guided home a winner with this film. The movie sets a course at the beginning and you know where you're headed in the first five minutes-- but Craig's the captain of the ship and this journey is filled with surprises and wonderfully subtle moments that give the film a fun trajectory and a brisk pace. You breezily travel through a fantastic, hilarious and utterly sublime entertainment. Bravo!",8,223,239,9 January 2011
2012," An Unexpected, Transcendently Bad Treat
","I really didn't expect much. I knew the resumé's of the players: The Cast, The Producer, The Director. But damn!... Damn!... I had so much fun watching this destruct-orgy... I have to say it was really, really funny. I almost gave this 8 stars, but I was afraid people would get the wrong idea about me... me!? Woody Harrelson had me in tears. John Cusack played it so straight for awhile... then a wink and a nod would peek through... I see... you're in on the joke. I get it. This movie is so over the top, it redefines where the top is. Try fifty-thousand feet higher than you think it should be. I think this film and its relative box-office success have given way to its real achievement: lowering the bar on script development to the point that it would hardly qualify as an English language film. Yet there is the comedy... brilliantly, defiantly staring me in the face, making me laugh though the part in the film where the second act is supposed to go. My ribs are hurting... but nobody spends two hundred million on a comedy! I can't reconcile it. Not even Mozart could construct such a tangled web of coincidence; cliché, coincidence; cliché, ad infinitum, ad nauseum. Oh, and the moral crisis... I almost forgot about the moral crisis... it appears in the 'third act', stapled to the main scientist guy like a 'For Rent' sign on a North Hollywood mailbox on the last day of the month. I wallowed selfishly in the ham-fisted, contrived, thinly woven gauze of the plot, giggling and laughing my way into a sublime euphoria. Even the word 'contrived' has lost its measure, its weight. All that is left is the far-away echo that hearkens to a time when movies were made by people that could marshall more than just an escrow account of foreign pre- sales fees, leveraged-hedge-fund-private-equity participations. I wipe away the tears of laughter, with fond memories of the computer-generated images of destruction so perversely maudlin, goofy even, yet vividly realistic-- like a special effects corporate welfare program. Thank you, Roland Emmerich, sir, for not pulling out and shooting your load of cinematic brilliance on the audience's tramp-stamp.",4,3,5,24 November 2009
The Hurt Locker," A Great Film Undermined By Style
","I really liked the writing, the acting, the direction of this film. However, the hand-held camera-work was repetitive, artificially motivated and self-conscious, and it took me right out of the movie. I have to say this because I really liked this movie and I feel like the actors did a fantastic job making their characters feel real. But all this work is undermined by the artifice and the visual cliché of the shaky hand-held camera. The camera movement was so disconnected from the action, it called such attention to itself, it took me right out of the movie. The filmmakers should have studied 'Children of Men' for how to use the camera more effectively.",7,0,3,7 August 2009
Paranormal Activity," Yes, it lives up to the hype, if you give it a chance.
","I was skeptical that a film like this could actually deliver the required thrills and chills to keep me interested, but it delivered. Don't expect huge production value, but you can expect to get absorbed into the story and witness some chilling moments and yes, even some terror. Like the Exorcist, this film presents an intimate peek into the lives of a couple terrorized by something unseen. But unlike the Exorcist, there's no Priests that show up to deal with it. Let's be clear: this film is artfully constructed by a filmmaker that has studied the underlying Psychology of horror and they really stick it to you. This film has a huge impact in a theatre, with a fun crowd of young girls ripe to shriek at every turn. I doubt this film will have the needed impact on DVD. So I suggest you fill out the petition to get it to your local theatre so you can enjoy the ride like I got to. You won't regret it. Take a date. There's plenty of charm and laughs early on from the wonderful actors who play the couple ( they're also decent cinematographers) and so you really get a sense of dread when the spooky shows up. I have very high standards, but the IMDb rating tells the tale.",8,1,3,9 October 2009
The Fountain," Six Minute Short Film Squeezed into 98 minutes
","Had this film been edited down to six to twelve minutes, I would have lauded it as one of the most brilliant shorts I'd ever seen. There simply is no story. I think Aronovsky is a brilliant thinker and shows great promise as a film maker, but this film is lost. I found it indulgent, narcissistic, intentionally vague (always a hallmark of missing story) and utterly pretentious. I have a sneaking suspicion that the entire concept of this film hangs on a somewhat arcane quote from Stanley Kubrick, that death is a disease and we will one day find the cure. I hope the next film that Aronovsky makes takes into consideration that the Audience is a critical piece of the equation in Cinema.",3,3,8,27 November 2006
Munich," Sadly Inevitable
","Mr. Spielberg has now sadly been drawn into this phenomenon we call terrorism. No civilized person will be allowed to be neutral on this subject in the coming years. Paving the way, as always, is the art world... heralding the coming of the subject of terrorism and the Middle East in particular as they invade popular culture and the debate begins to be democratized as it seeps out into the masses. Before Cinema, Governments, Zealots and Radicals made their own rules, playing the power game of nationalism and politics free from the scrutiny of those they govern. Now, we are learning how deep the hatreds run among the players and how ruefully unprepared our elected officials are in combating it. Dramatized though it is in parts, Munich lets us peek at the sick momentum that builds within and without world events and the inevitable cause and effect that will ultimately, it seems, decide which group or cause will one day triumph. I am saddened that Mr. Spielberg, who I'm sure, like all of us, would rather live in a world where there are no ugly realities to inspire such films as this, would feel compelled to tell the story of the Sword of Gideon. I long for the days when we could watch the summer blockbuster escapism, blissfully unaware that outside the theater was a desperate world fighting to remain civilized. The French arms-dealers who traffic in information and lives are such a great illustration of that time, swathed in their cultured hermitage, able to ignore the collateral costs of their family business with at least as much passion as they reserve for their cheeses and wine. The Spielberg of the multiplex cinema generation has moved into darker, more uncomfortable waters, the only guide for the filmmaker and his audience is our own conscience. Here then is the echo of the mind that made E.T., Saving Private Ryan, Amistad and The Color Purple. He knows us so well, he's sure that inside we are as decent and civil as he is and he knows he merely has to show us the images and we will choose the right path. But they must be images we have not already been desensitized to, because the journey of Munich is not one we can observe from afar. In this journey we must be participants. Because we are of course active participants in the reality of Munich, in the debate about terrorism, in the prayer for a lasting peace, in the hope that men will someday care more about this world than they do the next world.",9,1,4,2 January 2006
The Island," The most important subject Mr. Bay may ever tackle...
","Regardless of the Producer's comments concerning Ms. Johanssen's and Mr. McGregor's connection with the audience, it is clear in the film that the actors are reflecting the stunted emotional depth of their characters. This aspect of the performances may get lost in the explosions and car chases, because it is one of the more nuanced and subtle aspects of the film. While I respect Mr. Bay's craft as a filmmaker, I'm not part of the demographic he is targeting usually. So, I just can't 'get into' Mr. Bay's films, even though they look great. I'm missing something from practically every one of them. Except this one. The Island has that thing I'm looking for, but midway through, the film just morphs into a tired (yes, it's tired...) action-movie string of set-piece 'stunt-gredients'. The basis for the film, the reason The Island exists... that has weight and gravity and a sense of urgency, but it is exhausted(!) in the first 'Act'. It's clear that Mr. Bay is really only interested in having 17 to 22 year-old's buy tickets for his films, because he seems to be ignoring the intellectual and emotional demands of audiences over 30 yrs old. I don't want that to sound like a criticism, designed to nullify Mr. Bay's effectiveness as a filmmaker. What I hope is that Mr. Bay listens to this comment as an invitation from a great, vast audience of people hungry for some compelling cinema. Are you up to the challenge, Mr. Bay? We anxiously await your answer, with millions of dollars of ticket money that we will not part with until we're given better reasons to go to the cinemas on the opening weekend.",5,2,3,17 August 2005
