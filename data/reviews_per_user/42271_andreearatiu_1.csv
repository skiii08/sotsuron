The Lobster," Captures attention and requires reflection.
","The movie surprises with some awkward truths regarding relationships, mostly exposes in a strange way. It's a dark comedy that captures attention and requires reflection. 'The Lobster' presents an original idea and a disturbing way of looking at love relationships. Its uniqueness puts the sinister aspects of the movie in an interesting light. The film's message is well delivered through symbolic dialogues which amuse and reveal. It directly attacks society. The metamorphosis of the single people into animals may symbolize the lack of choice and pressure that sometimes society offers and the single person viewed less credible in the world where finding the better half is almost everyone's purpose. An artistic and pessimistic way of seeing love.",10,3,10,7 January 2016
