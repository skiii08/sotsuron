Requiem for a Dream," The drugs don't work, but we knew that didn't we.
","This harrowing film, though lacking the quirky humour of Trainspotting is a cinematic triumph. Although an equally dark subject to Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn, this is a far superior opus thanks to Aronsky's direction and the performances of the four leads. Ellen Burstyn is superb and the next time my fridge starts making strange noises I'll call in an exorcist instead of the electrician. We always knew Jennifer Connelly was one of the most beautiful women around; we should all look this good when strung out, but the extension to her acting range with this role has been quite a surprise. The cinematography is excellent and the techniques for distorting reality and experiencing the rushes and the subsequent downs is exhilarating, if that's the right word. I don't think it can be called an experimental film, well not to the degree of Memento, but this unique medium must be exploited in the way these films do it.",8,0,0,9 November 2001
Mulholland Drive," More 'Twin Peaks' than 'Straight Story'
","And I'm not talking about Laura Harring ! When you see films like this it only reinforces the idea of the wonder of this medium. At times you think you are going 'loopy' as the story wraps around like a Moebius strip, but Lynch's style carries you through even the most surreal parts. This film has style and atmosphere in spades not to mention the cast of eccentric characters. I was half expecting a bit of tap from Ann Miller but we got jive instead. The two leads are excellent and their chemistry is amongst the most erotic I've seen on the screen. Was the Blue Box going to reveal a 'Kiss Me Deadly' secret or was it just made by McGuffin. It's not a story for the linear mind and you will find yourself thinking about it for hours (and who knows, maybe days) later, that is, if you've managed to shift 'Memento' ! We all know that David Lynch is weird and we know that there is nothing wrong with it as long as he can tell a story like this.",8,1,2,9 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter didn't transfix this middle-aged Muggle
","As an adult with no children and having not read any of the books I was wondering what all the fuss was about. Obviously I can't make comparison or express disappointments between book and film but I can see enough strange, menacing and funny characters as well as myriad incidents to keep most children enthralled for more than two hours. We can clearly see where the money has been well spent in transforming this parallel magical universe into something that George Lucas would put his name to. I was rather surprised by the relatively subdued reaction of the(mostly under 15) audience both during and at the end of the movie, with few fearful gasps or hoots of laughter that makes me wonder that my simliar behaviour was not so off the mark. I feel there is not very much in this film for most adults (or their inner children) especially when one compares it to brilliant efforts like the Toy Stories, Shrek and not to mention all the Simpsons episodes. I'm sure my commentary is quite irrelevant to all the kids still waiting to see it (or see it again) so call my reaction humbug and I await a visit from the Ghost of Hogwarts Past anytime now !",7,0,0,29 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix should be Rebooted after this tedious sequel
","The basic idea of The Matrix was interesting and the effects groundbreaking, however I should have known better than to expect an evolutionary development of the characters and plot. It is a shameful waste of money when they say just one 14min fight scene cost $40m. All the action sequences go on way too long and simply become tiresome with the directors incapable of knowing how to keep the drama tight. There's little humour to sweaten the pill other than Merovingian's swearing in French that he likens 'to wiping your ar.. with silk'. The appearance of Monica Bellucci did raise my pulse for a moment but she was little more than eye candy.",3,0,0,26 June 2003
Blow," An uncolourful film of a colourful life
",I suppose Traffic is the benchmark for drugs movies even if it isn't one strictly from the smugglers point of view. Perhaps Mr Demme should have partaken of the said title in order to give the audience a little buzz too. Despite the exotic locations of Mexico and Colombia this is really an unattractive film to look at. The cinematography is unimaginative and the colours themselves are anaemic. The storytelling is very conventional for such an interesting story and the dialogue seems to come from someone high on herb tea. The performances are generally good and it's very nice to see Ray Liotta not going over the top for once. Ms Cruise also does well with an unflattering role while Johnny Depp ages rather better than the real George Jung in this parable of dishonour among thieves. It should be left to Robert Sabbag to adapt his brilliant Snowblind and give us the 100% pure article.,5,3,4,17 October 2001
