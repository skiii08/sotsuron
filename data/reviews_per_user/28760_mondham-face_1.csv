Sucker Punch," 2 movies in 1: Sucker (boring story & bad acting) and Punch (cool action scenes)
","I went to see Sucker Punch with fairly low expectations for the plot and acting, and wasn't disappointed. I also expected to see some visually rich, CG-infused action scenes, and again, wasn't disappointed.What Snyder attempts to do with this film is never fully realized, as we are at first subjected to a boring, drab sequence intended to make us FEEL something for the story's heroine. I never did. There wasn't enough there to hook me. I just kept waiting for the alternate reality action sequences to kick in.When the action does finally start, the film jumps into overdrive - but in fits and starts, and only visually. The story and characters, even for an action-heavy fantasy film (very little in the way of sci-fi tech or imagery), are so silly and disconnected that the viewer is never given the opportunity to care about them. Yes, I get the idea that this is 'insanity envisioned', but still ... it left me feeling flat.The arc of the story itself builds toward an epic finish, but ultimately disappoints the viewer as the film completely falls apart in the final 20 minutes. I'm sure Snyder thought he was making a tragedy, but that form only works when the audience is drawn in by character exposition and solid plotting, neither of which exist in this film.",5,3,8,21 April 2011
