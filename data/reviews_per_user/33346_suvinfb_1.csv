Iron Man 3," Marvel Phase II Ultimate Disaster
","How was the story approved to be made in the first place? I would have given a 0 if I had the option. After watching this Shane Black should never be given a movie in Hollywood. Bryan Singers Superman was way better than the likes of this movie. Iron man 1 was the ultimate benchmark for any super hero movie and Iron man 3 is right the opposite. i hardly write reviews but i was so disappointed by how they destroyed the characters Iron man, Mandarin and even AIM, i just had to tell the world and warn anyone who likes Iron man. After watching this i wouldn't mind seeing someone else as Iron man instead of RobertDowney Jr, in the future. Marvel has destroyed its Phase 2 plan. I Really don't see how they will ever recover from this downfall. This summer was actually a fight between Iron man and Superman, Marvel Vs DC. It feel like DC has the upper hand now. Hope they don't screw things up with Superman like Marvel did with Iron Man 3.",1,25,51,30 April 2013
