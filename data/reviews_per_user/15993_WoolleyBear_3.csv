Blade Runner 2049," Dystopian perfection
","Well written and ingeniously structured, Blade Runner 2049 was quite difficult to follow, however, that's what makes it such a remarkably clever film. Almost Black-Mirroresque, Blade Runner 2049 is something completely new, I cannot think of anything in this genre that comes remotely close to this style of storytelling. The atmospheric music and sound effects throughout are cleverly composed to portray a perfect mix of thought evoking emotions that a dystopian future would introduce. The film is a scattered jigsaw puzzle, only revealing the completed picture at the very end.",10,2,9,7 October 2018
Black Hawk Down," Slowly builds into an Action-packed film
","A slow start until the operation starts, however, then it is non-stop action. The switching between the front-line and the bosses back at base was well done.",7,1,2,24 July 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Thrilling account!
",A thrilling and gripping account of one of the most important operations in US history.,10,0,1,24 July 2018
