50 First Dates," I Cried
","This movie is funny. It's packed with magnetically funny characters and the actors have great timing. The Sandman and Drew work great together and Schneider and Astin steal the show. The Hawaiian backdrop is gorgeous. I am a huge Minnesota Vikings fan and I love that my team is part of the movie, even though I have no idea why.But what I really love about this movie is the love story, I was surprisingly and, at times, overwhelmingly touched by Henry and Lucy's plight. During the conclusion, while Israel kamakawiwo'ol's version of 'Somewhere over rainbow' plays gently, I had tears running down cheeks. Like a lot of Sandler movies, there is a beating heart mixed into the silliness. I heard this one loud and clear.",7,3,4,23 May 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry at age 13
","First off, I'm a fan of the books. I have read this particular chapter, or should I say year, several times. My feelings on the film are as follows:There are many new things to talk about this time out. First, Dumbledore's replacement. For those not in the know, Richard Harris passed shortly after the second film was finished. To me, he was the perfect Dumbledore right from the beginning and I had a hard time seeing a new face in the role. Michael Gambon was satisfactory but too many key elements from the character are missing. Instead of playing Dumbledore as a wise, kind and somewhat tired old wizard as Harris did, Gambon seems more energetic and detached from the main characters. I felt as though he and Harry's relationship took a step backwards from the previous movies. I felt as though Harris' performance was closer to Dumbledore as written in the books. Second, we have a new director. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron steps in and to my delight has given the series a fresh and interesting approach. He approaches the darker tones found in the book with vigor and panache. I was very happy with his visual style. It was very bold and edgy, yet full of emotion. Yeah 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' dude. Way to step up. Great job with the dementors and Sirius Black.This is what I consider the turning point towards maturity for the characters in the books. I was very happy to see that this transition was also made in the film version. 8/10Also, I would like it to be known that this is one of John Williams' very best film scores, and that's saying a lot. He was robbed at the Oscars. Oh well. He has 5 already.",8,0,2,24 November 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Please see this film!
","First of all, I am a guy who loves historical dramas, action movies, horror movies, and other guy mentality related stuff. Secondly, let it be known that I love Moulin Rouge! Moulin Rouge is not only my favorite movie of 2001,(LOTR being a close second), but also my favorite surprise of the year. I did not expect to like this film. I left the theatre confused. 'Was I supposed to like this movie?' I asked myself. 'Oh man are my friends gonna make fun of me.' But who cares. I'm sure everyone out there has felt passion for a movie. I felt true passion for Moulin Rouge! What caught me first was, of course, the music. Please, Academy, recognize this crowning achievement. Through the music I was taken into the story with an amazing clarity. I felt the emotions of all the characters. I laughed with them, and yes, cried with them. I have new respect for the young Jedi Ewan. Ladies & Gents, this guy can sing. This guy can sing good! And so can the lovely Nicole. The two of them were a screen match made in heaven. And you can't go wrong with John 'The Pest' Leguizamo playing the great, vertically challenged, french painter Toulouse-Lautrec. This great film was well worth the taunting jeers of my stupid friends (ignorance is bliss to them if ya know what I mean). Forget what you think you know, and just enjoy what a true screen gem looks and feels like. Then buy the soundtrack and DVD like I did.",8,0,1,20 January 2002
The Evil Dead," The epitome of an underground classic
","I know it goes against the popular mass, but Evil Dead is my favorite of the Dead trilogy. Yes, it is true that the Sam Raimi quirkiness seemed to become more and more apparent as the trilogy rolled along. Each film possesses its own personality, and I found the desperate solitude created in the smoky hills of Evil Dead the most cinematically effective. Evil Dead, to me, had the most in common with later Raimi films like The Gift and A Simple Plan. All three films relied on silence and surprise as its main technique. As opposed to the zany, eye grabbing  circus of his Army of Darkness, Evil Dead II & Darkman.To me, Evil Dead set the stage for a classic. We had young filmmakers, not yet tattered by the spoils of Hollywood, sacrificing everything to make a movie and a career for themselves. There was nothing for an audience to go on except what they're eyes were experiencing right at that very moment. I myself didn't expect to see a film with blood running down the screen. The violence and gore is legendary, only being eclipsed by Peter Jackon's 'Dead Alive.' Evil Dead, unlike most horror films, doesn't seem to exist only to bleed and spill though, but more to act as a window for young Sam's need to make movies. This is my favorite part about a filmmaker. I think that such an attitude produces the best results creatively. Hence, my stance on the dubbing of classic. Some might disagree to the fullest but that's just the way it is in the critical circle. I, however, will never stop recommending this movie.",9,0,0,21 January 2002
Titanic," James Cameron's 'Titanic'
","I have waited several years to attempt to review this film for several reasons. I wanted to have my thoughts completely in order. I didn't want to join either side of the debate here. One side feels as though this film is the greatest of all time, the other comes with a force of backlash the size of the tidal wave in 'The Abyss.' Well now, nearly a decade later, I write my thoughts. I, like many males my age, am a huge James Cameron fan. I absolutely love Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator films. I feel as though he has an amazing eye for how the action in the scene needs to be conveyed on the screen. He has a very unique and complete imagination. And an unbelievable work ethic to boot. Nothing, in regards to these points, changes in Titanic. He is on his game. And he deserved everything he got back. This film is truly one of the greatest risks in all of film. Just take The Postman for example. The Postman was released this same year and went down in history as one of the biggest box office flops of all time and is regarded by a harsh majority as one of the worst movies of all time as well. Yet Kevin Costner worked hard and a lot of money was spent in order to create the film. So why did Cameron's film fare so much better?James Cameron involved more viewers with this source material than his other projects had. He still integrated amazing visuals and top notch effects into his film to please the male 18 to 30 crowd, yet the inclusion of a grand and harrowing love story caught the interest of female and older viewers as well. This is not a sell out. If you listen to James Cameron speak about this film, his interest was completely emotional from the beginning. I can't imagine how he must've felt observing the remains of the great ship laying silently at the bottom of the sea, knowing how many died and how many lives were changed when it sank. I feel as though he achieved his ultimate goal when he made Titanic. The action scenes here were a necessary tool in order to tell his human story to maximum effect, not the human story being necessary in order to tell his action story as is usually the case with his films. I feel as though he did a very good job with this change.As for any clichés. Honestly, I don't see any. There of course is the usual story devices used to get characters into conflict, but let's be honest people, this film has no more a Hollywood cliché as say a movie like...Good Will Hunting. So let's put that backlash theory to rest. Also, I've heard quite a bit of talk about historical inaccuracies in this film. I'm sure that there are quite a few, so I won't even attempt to argue. I will however point out that other historic epics have made great films with this same problem, and haven't seen nearly half the backlash that Titanic did. Take Gladiator, Braveheart, or even a more intimate movie like Cinderella Man. All great, all historical, all inaccurate. So who really cares. Is it a well made movie? That's all that really matters. Titanic is a well made movie.Titanic is by no means perfect. It is not the greatest film of all time in my opinion. But no one can argue that this film will go down in history as a great achievement. A very rare diamond in the rough that achieves box office glory, critic applause, and a large trophy cabinet. For new viewers of this film, watch only on the merits that are presented to you on the screen. Forget what the pro and con people have to say, forget how much it made, how many awards it won, and how historically accurate it is. Just let it in. My guess is that you will enjoy yourself. Afterall, this is nearly required viewing anyway. P.S. After almost ten years, I still feel as though the music in this movie is as good as it can get. James Horner does an amazing job creating a timeless back drop of music that will help carry this film through the ages.9/10",9,3,5,27 November 2005
War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'
","I am a huge Steven Spielberg fan. To me, this film was never about special FX, how well it would do against Episode III, or Tom Cruise. I was just eager to see my idol's next project. He seemed excited to be doing it. All involved seemed excited too. And then something happened. Tom Cruise was jumping all over couches and spouting lessons of Scientology, people who loved Episode III became haters inadvertently, and audience members left the theaters disappointed at the abrupt ending, somehow forgetful of how the original literary material ends. And the attention to Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' detoured from a critique on the craftsmanship involved, to the silly circus of people around it.By all accounts, this film is excellent on many levels. The pacing is right on, the special FX are indeed superb, John Williams' score is a great parallel to the action on screen, and Spielberg again shows his knack for creating unforgettable images laden with emotion, horror, and pulse-pounding adrenaline.Although I personally feel that this film could've been so much more plot wise, I also feel that it redeems its' faults with its' plethora of virtues. Spielberg makes movies with his heart. It seems that some audience members are surprised at this. Some people may not like this film. Some may like it. But the fact of the matter is that one of the great director's of our era has composed a great summer blockbuster and more went right than wrong.If anyone should doubt Spielberg's elite place in the annals of the world of film, show me another filmmaker who has managed to stay on top for 30 years.Just Enjoy!",7,2,4,24 July 2005
The Island," Bay at his Best
","I will get right to the point. Michael Bay has proved two things to me with 'The Island': 1. Now that the Star Wars saga has closed its' doors, true science fiction, i.e. Soylent Green, Planet of the Apes, has made a return to the film world. 2. Bay has finally reached the next level in his directorial career.This is arguably Bay's best film. Although it does still have his signature brutal action sequences, character based comic relief, and mass vehicle destruction, it seems that he has found and held onto the deeper meaning in the source material here. Slick direction, beautiful cinematography, and fresh performances by the talented cast make this one of the summer's most underrated and hopefully appreciated screen gems.",8,3,6,24 July 2005
