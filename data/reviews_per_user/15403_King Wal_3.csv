Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A minor disappointment.
","In 1 word, disappointing. In a lot more, something like this. Oh dear. What had potential to become a classic film has turned out to be only a good film. Its not bad, but not a classic. There are some good new characters like Jar-Jar Binks and Darth Maul, but sadly Anakin Skywalker isn't one of them. He's more of an irritant then anything else, shouting YIPPEE every few minutes. And like Yoda, Jaar Jar Binks (good though he is) needs a translator. But these  are only minor flaws. The film has some great moments (The Pod Race), some brilliant props (The double-sided light sabre - I want one!) and some downright tacky bits (The Parade). But it is a great film, just not a classic. And what is it what George Lucas, Royalty and large amounts of hair?82%",8,0,0,19 July 1999
The Shining," Great film
","Yep this film is brilliant. Not as a direct novelisation but as a standalone film. This is better than the dire TV series, but although Jack Nicholson, Danny Lloyd & Scatman Crothers are brilliant the film is let down by Shelley Duvall who is just too American. But watch this and ignore her.",7,1,2,11 September 1999
American Beauty," The best film I've seen in a long time. SPOILER
","This is one of the best films I've seen in ages. I'd heard good reviews about it, but I went in with average expections. But it is a brilliant film that leaves you compelled right up until the end of the film, when it has you guessing who killed him. Spacey, Benning, Suvari & Birch have rarely been better, and I urge you to go out and discover this flawless gem for yourself. 10/10",10,0,0,1 April 2000
