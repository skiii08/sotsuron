Walk the Line," dragged on
","Walk the Line was a good movie, no doubt about it. Joaquin Phoenix practically became Johnny Cash, and Reese Witherspoon was perfect for the role of June Carter. It was interesting to learn about how Johnny Cash got started, how his brother died, how he was married when he met June, as was she, and how he was in the Air Force before he became a star, which was what technically got him started, anyway. Tyler Hilton played a good Elvis and Waylon Payne played a good Jerry Lee Curtis.Now this is why I didn't like it: it dragged on forever! Johnny Cash was kind of messed up and took drugs a lot, but that was what the entire movie circulated around. The entire move, Johnny is walking around high or drunk. It's depressing! See it, but kids probably won't enjoy it.",6,0,2,15 July 2006
1408," Best Horror Film Since the Sixth Sense
","This was a surprisingly good horror movie. I love John Cusack, because of Say Anything, which is the only reason I wanted to see this movie, but it was actually good. It wasn't exactly scary, but it made you think more than say, the Grudge 2, like the Sixth Sense. It was fairly predictable, but it's a horror movie. What do you expect. It was too long as well.For Samuel L. Jackson fans, be warned that he really isn't in this movie very much.For those who don't like horror movies, don't see it.For everyone else, SEE IT!!!!",8,1,2,23 June 2007
