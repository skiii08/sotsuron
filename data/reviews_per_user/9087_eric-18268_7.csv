The Equalizer," suspenseful
","Antoine fuqua is great, denzel washington is himself . love the suspense . aaaah ! the satisfaction when the character is a vigilante using his evil knowledge to do in the bad guys ... (until they go crazy themselves) ...",9,0,2,4 August 2018
A Star Is Born," disappointed
","At first i really really like the music, the pace and i thought it was going to wash away the raunchy memory of the 1976 version, where the immense ego of one and the famed personality of the other actor overwhelmed the story .
i did not know bradley cooper before this role so i thought he was a good match for lady gaga, and an offset to her personality . then, it became draggy and boring . an alcoholic performer is a pitiful sight but becomes really annoying when the misery is stretched for too long, especially when i came for entertainment, not sufferance . his ending puts a totally depressing note in an entertaining feature .
lady gaga was good in her early role as a performer, but as she rises in fame, she becomes lady gaga herself and rivals the immense ego of barbara streisand in the earlier version .
after the wedding, the movie becomes draggy and boring . it should have been edited to last under 2 hours but was stretched way too long . i can understand why it failed so soon from the premium theaters to be relegated to the cheaper venues . waste of my time . and i hadn't seen so many people leave the theater during the show in a long time .
if a little bit of the dirty, funny business behind the scenes like in the 'rock star' (mark wahlberg, 2001) had been used, it may have spiked the action, fun, interest into the movie .",6,1,4,19 January 2019
Deadpool 2," raunchy funny
","Comics feature is not my genre but i went to see this, intrigued by the previews . well it was funny, raunchy funny . not the cartoons for kids to watch on saturday morning :)",9,1,3,15 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," not bad
","Highly predictable, but entertaining . too short a review says imdb but i have nothing to add .",8,1,10,4 August 2018
Blood Diamond," what a world
","I watched this for the second time throughout, still mesmerized by the action, the suspense and the emotion of the characters . i am sure that the film is much cleaner than the reality in the theater of a conflict, no smell, no heat, no humidity, no real screams and crying, yet it is poignant . since archer became somewhat human, it would have been nice to imagine him meeting maddy in the end .",9,0,0,13 September 2019
The Shape of Water," not science-fiction but a fantasy/love story
",The disappointment expressed by many happens when movies are wrongly advertised as one genre but are not (i saw the same thing happen with 'the grandmaster) . i expected a science-fiction story . i was pleasantly surprised to watch a fantasy-love story . i have seen it three times already . just love it ! the love story totally supplants the meanness and cruelty of the era . well done !,10,3,7,28 July 2018
Joker," depressing
","This rates a -5 stars for the depressing effect of the story .
I do not write much reviews because i am not very eloquent nor elaborate, but i must write a warning about this film . i did not really know what to expect exactly, but expecting more of a comic action like the preceding episodes .
oops ! major oops ! this is a sad, depressing psychological story . the writer/director who did this story are sick, twisted, depressing minds .
i did sit thru the whole movie, always expecting that the story would turn positive, enlightening, entertaining . waste of my time .
joaquin phoenix acting is superb despite the negative impression i got from the story .
so the warning is : take some anti-depressants before going to see this movie .",Null,1,4,26 January 2020
