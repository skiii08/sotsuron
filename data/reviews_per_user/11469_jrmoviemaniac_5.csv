The Avengers," One of the best of the best superheroes of all time
","I'm gonna say this to every hater and naysayer who calls this film overrated:I love this movie.Nothing will ever change that:Everything in this film worked for me the characters are all great,love the visuals (the best I've seen since the original Star Wars films),A solid story,great villain,and the best experience I've had in the theater in a long time.I literally jumped out of my seat with every action sequence in this movie.When the avengers finally assembled I geeked out:It was a great moment.Hulk definitely steals the show at the end.I enjoyed the Dark knight rises but it can't compare to this film:A fast pace and well worth the wait.My 4th favorite movie of all time.By the way Iron Man is my favorite Avenger.An excellent superhero movie with so much rewatchability.",10,1,7,30 January 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," I loved this sequel!
","I went into this film with a lot of expectations and I must say they were surpassed.Once again Marvel gives us another entertaining film leading up to Avengers Age of Ultron.The action in this film was exciting,fun and very intense.It was light hearted in tone which helped the film a lot.It had a lot of subtle moments that i did not expect.Chris Evans continues to own this role and really does a great job.I loved Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow:She's sexy,tough and a really exciting presence on screen.The winter soldier himself is very hardcore and If you see the film you will know what i mean.Veteran actors like Samuel L Jackson and Robert Redford do a great job in the film to their credit.If you go see it keep 2 things in mind:Go with an open mind and stay after the end credits.Trust me its worth it.A very solid sequel and to me It gave me more thrills than Man of Steel and The Dark knight sequels.Yes that's saying a lot but that's just my opinion.",9,6,12,5 April 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A great return to the wonders of Middle earth
","First of all,I respect the original Lord of the rings trilogy and love all the films.They were all very entertaining and epic especially watching them on the big screen(which I did see them in their extended cuts).This new film was a nice return to that feeling of wonder in the world of fantasy.I have to give props to Martin Freeman who played the young Bilbo Baggins.He was great portraying this character:he was funny,charming and a very relatable character.His journey really pulled me in.The other characters were fun too and the adventures they go through are amazing.The visuals are really cool for the most part they really give you that feeling of pure fantasy.There are some flaws:the film is a bit long and some scenes could have been shorter.Also some characters don't do much and were just there.One thing that I was happy to see again was Andy Serkis as Gollum.Very funny and he steals the scenes he is in.Overall a great film I loved from 2012.",8,1,3,14 March 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A marvelous sequel!
","Some spoilers:Let me say this to everyone who will read this review:I loved the first Avengers movie.Its my 4th favorite movie of all time.This sequel I love as well.Everything I loved in the first one was in this sequel with some new additions.The Hulkbuster scene stole the show with its total destruction with Iron man Punching Hulk in the face over and over.It was very funny with a lot of heart and humanity.Scarlet Witch,Quicksilver,and Vision were nice additions to the film.I loved James Spader as Ultron his voice alone was intriguing and very intimidating.The action scenes were amazing with top notch visual effects and the ending was highly enjoyable.I love this movie with a burning passion and I love the characters in it.All the actors did superb work and made one of the most entertaining sequels i have ever seen.10 out of 10 the best film of 2015 for me.",10,2,7,8 May 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The end of an era
","Believe me I am not a Twihard never was and never will be.I really did not care for the first 4 films because I was bored with this hyped up romance.Emo sparkling Vamps are not for me however,this film I didn't hate.Let me explain:I saw this one in the theater alone with dozens of ladies all around me.I watched it and I have to say I was sorta surprised:It wasn't as painful as I thought it would be.Although there are still the same problems the other films had:Lame acting,boring romance,etc there are some things I actually enjoyed in this:This film is shot very well(beautiful locations)the score was actually good it got me invested,I thought Mackenzie Foy who played Renesmee was really cute,and the action when its there it makes it less boring.Also I laughed at some of the dialogue a lot so thats not too bad.An epic finale?not really.A total guilty pleasure?Yes.",6,1,7,30 January 2013
