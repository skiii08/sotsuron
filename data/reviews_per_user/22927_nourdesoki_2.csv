1917," Boring Movie
","I have watched the movie '1917' @ cinema last night and here is my review
1. The movie is poor in Drama scenes which make you live the journey with two soldiers and suffer with them. I didn't suffer , i didn't feel sorry for anyone dying. Director doesnt push to feel pain while watching in war scenes he tried but not too much.2. A lot of talking scenes and i dont mind with that btw but those scenes should be perfect with well script writing & acting but this didnt happen.
3. Silly scenes while soldier runs away from germans to deliver a message and silly way the soldier died.4. Director tried to show his skills in camera , photograph & picture and made it but not affect with Drama which must be the main goal for movie as mentioned in point numbet 1 .",6,0,0,17 January 2020
