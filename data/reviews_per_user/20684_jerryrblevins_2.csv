The Hangover," Great first watch, Mediocre replay value
","This is a revised review of this movie. I originally gave it a 9, but after the hype and rewatching this movie, my views have changed. Afterall, the true test of a movie is time.Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, the first time I saw it. But unlike other comedies, Tommy Boy, Old School, Happy Gilmore, etc. this movie doesn't have replay value.The initial shock of the photos was epic for me in the theaters, but it lost a lot of weight after knowing they were coming when I watched it on DVD.Great 1st time watch. Below average 2nd.....",6,0,5,23 June 2009
Shutter Island," Enjoyable Experience at the MatinÃ©e
","This film did what few films have; it made me think.I had higher expectations of this film for many reasons. One, Scorsese directed. Two, great cast. Three, the reviews on IMDb have been high.About half way through this movie I was glad that Scorsese was at the helm and not M. Night Shyamalan. It has that kind of feeling that you get watching one of M. Night's movies, but since Scorsese was directing, I didn't know that there would be a great 'twist' or just an ending. Scorsese usually holds onto something to reveal at the end, but you can't ever anticipate the outcome.DiCaprio was outstanding, and Ruffalo did an incredible job portraying his character. And I think Scorsese outdid himself with this one. This wasn't a project that you would immediately point out that it was a strong point for him to direct. But he guided this dark tale to a great ending.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be taken in by a movie and anyone who likes to be provoked into thought.",8,1,3,21 February 2010
