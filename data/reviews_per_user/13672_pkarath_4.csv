3:10 to Yuma," AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME Western Movie
",I really took a lot of time in getting this DVD assuming the western classic movie remake will be kind off slow. But i made it watching and now i feel why i shouldn't have watched it in the first place. Both Russel crowne and Christain Bale are awesome. Their kind of friendship relation is depicted magnificently. From the start till the end its a kind of action pack ride. The end part is very good which would have not been better than this. Bale as his role shows a man of true spirit to justice and Russel crowne though being a thief shows his inner emotion with Bale at the end when he was shot dead by one of his own men. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and definitely worth 9/10.,9,0,0,16 November 2008
The Alamo," Great Historic Movie. Definitely 7/10
","We all know that making a historic movie requires great talent. Although this isn't made to be the best, but still this is a great movie to watch and i came to know how Texas was added to United States list. Great acting by many. The movie was slow at many places but it conveyed the situation of the people at Alamo who lost their lives fighting with bravery. The direction is as usual and the way the story is told can be appreciated. Definitely a worth watch and the rating given definitely cant be less than 6. It deserves 7/10. Dennis Quad acting was good and the way he tells to beat San Antonia is impressive by comparing the battle of wellington with Napolean.",7,1,1,18 October 2008
Tropic Thunder," Good comedy movie. Hats off to Ben stiller and the crew
","First fifteen minutes of the movies is somewhat boring, but the moment they land on the forest for actual take of the movie, the movies catches the fire and not let us get off from our seat.Tom cruise a surprising character, well acted in this movie showing his funnier side. Robert Jr was good with his dialog's. The dialog where he advises Ben not to act retarded fully in a movie was good. Jack black was OK in this movie not invoking any good jokes. Ben stiller is good at his direction and acting.The comic story line is what makes this movie one of the best comedy movie.Action sequence are made well. The ending was good.I would say great time pass movie for every adult owing to the rating and the violent scenes in the movie. Definitely 7/10 and would wish Ben to continue his career in the same best way. Awaiting for his next movie..",7,2,4,5 November 2008
Taken," Can't be TAKEN from my heart... Great Movie. Liam at his best.
","These days, good action movies are hard to find. Earlier we got it in the way of Bourne and Bond series. But this film definitely deserves high applaud for many reasons.. Liam neeson at this best, good direction, great plot... Human trafficking is well shown in this film. Entire minutes of this film are very beautiful and definitely can be watched one more time. I could see some negative review in this post but am surprised by those. Am waiting for Liam's next film Lincoln to be released soon. In this movie the kidnapping scene is one particular unique scene which is not shown in any movies. Certains details which are not shown, should be understood ourselves and if all the details are put in, then we would get a 3 hour slow paced movie rather an entertaining movie. I would recommended everyone to watch this movie if you want to spend some precious 93 moments of time.Hats off to Liam and the movie Taken, which cant never be TAKEN from any ones heart.",9,1,3,5 November 2008
