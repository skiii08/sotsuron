The Avengers," Assemble to the movies!
","The avengers is all characters we have met trying to figure out how to be a team. All of the consistent personalities conflicting with each other and then coming together. Hulk is a surprise beat highlight. Loki is a suitable villian. And we finally got our set up with our main evil behind the curtains, thanos. And iron man's sacrifice is a worthy one. 85%",8,0,0,8 June 2019
Iron Man 3," Strongest marvel film to this point
","Iron man 3 is a major surprise to kick off phase 2. Feels heavier, more emotional, more at stake, and more human than any marvel film in phase 1. We see Tony stark fall from grace, start from scratch and rise again. And the toll that the events prior have taken on him. Tony start has evolved and become fully fleshed out and for us to undoubtedly be by his side. Oh, and Sir Ben Kingsley gives us a marvel 'villian' performance to remember. A reminder of why he is one of the best. This one is more than just a popcorn flick. It holds weight. Major weight. 89%",9,0,0,8 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Marvel's Green Latern
","Cheesy lines, some clunky effects, some poor acting, and forced women empowerment makes for a very rough start to captain marvel. It's almost star wars prequel level. The whole movie seems so forced, like the little sister who jumps up and down saying I want a turn! I want a turn! Theres not a lot to mine here but they are really digging at nothing. The makeup for the villains are like an early doctor who episode. The movie is badly odd. Ben Mendelsohn does a pretty nice job. There are way more bad ass unintentional independent women in this universe than captain marvel. Black widow, every female warrior in black panther, even thano's daughters. So if they were trying to go for a 'superhero women can look up to' they dropped the ball hard on this pointless movie. Just go revisit the avengers and watch black widow kick some ass...or even wonder woman for that matter. This movie isn't for comic book fans. Bre Larson acts in this movie like she's never read one before. I mean, the movie isn't terrible, it's just terribly boring. 49%",4,1,3,15 July 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Retro Thor
","Ragnorok is silly. I guess the only way to keep thor going. Doctor strange's serious tone is almost all out the window now. An extreme self awareness of these characters. People are just straight getting murdered in this movie with no consequences which is weird after civil war. To go from civil war to this to infinity war is hard to deal with. It has great visuals and cool confident shots. This is just as wacky as the dark world but at least the wackiness is fun here. This movie doesn't really work for me as a marvel cinematic universe chapter, but as an individual thor movie it's crazy and amazing. It's just so damn silly and insane. Retro madness. It's like a thor adult swim sitcom or a doctor who episode. But finally, a climax in a marvel movie is actually the climax. Once led zeppelin kicks in and thor is fighting with his lighting, you get chills. Cate Blanchett does really well, and overall it's a good time. Probably the best marvel movie to watch if you dont want to follow the saga. 82%",8,1,9,29 June 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman: iron man's robin
","Spiderman homecoming beautifully opens with a clear and intelligent motivation for our villian, making him one of the strongest marvel movies. Oh and the villan being played by Michael Keaton really helps too. It feels like a high school marvel film. Even down to the music. The texting on screen. The tone matches the story and theme well. It's not big and flashy, it's a perfect little story in the spidey corner of the avengers. Some miscastings take me out of it sometimes like the Indian bully. A lot of fun moments showing parker's imperfections of being a new superhero like smashing into everyone's crap in their back yards. Good character arc for Peter, inspiring, even if the climax is a little less interesting than the rest of the movie. I enjoyed vulture and Peter's conversation and banter better than their fight scenes. Homecoming makes me for sure excited to see the next spidey film, but I also wont be coming back for this one for a while. 80%",8,0,6,28 June 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Bourne Captain America
","Captain America the Winter Soldier is definitely one could the say the spiciest of the marvel films so far. Full of huge plot twists and turns changing the game. The captain America storyline sure is showing it might be the most important over any other avenger. Amazing action sequences and set pieces. Very slick. Nick fury is a major highlight, fleshing his character and the movie really makes you root for him. Showing his badassery. Imagine the first captain America mixed with the entire Bourne trilogy. That's The Winter Soldier. If that doesn't sell you I dont know what will. 81%",8,1,3,12 June 2019
Doctor Strange," The doctor will see you now and also astroproject
","Doctor Strange is really good but also really flawed. His character is rushed, it's like they are just shoving you through it saying okay okay we gotta get to the important stuff! Some humor falls flat. Other times it's cute. Of course amazing visuals and they do have alot of fun with them, maybe not quite as much as ant man though. Doctor strange makes for a pretty neat hero. Tilda Swinton is this films biggest highlight, I almost wish she would join the avengers instead. The climax is different and clever. One could say strange maybe. A bit better than the first Thor and that's really all I can say. 70%",7,1,1,25 June 2019
Ant-Man," A marvel to look at
","Ant man. They never fully explain why it has to be him but I guess just get over it?Fun. Clever. But also a little clunky. You can definitely see Mkcay and Wright in this script. And you can corporate dipping their hands in the pot. Even though it wouldnt have matched with the cinematic universe it still makes you wonder what it what have been like with just the clear vision of Edgar Wright. When the jokes work they really work. When they fall flat they fall flat. But there are great visuals, and very clever usues of the ant suit power and the concept. Like the shower scene. Like alot of marvel movies, it's got big flaws. Like one of the most underwhelming villains yet. But it's also alot of fun. And has some surprises. A very fun new superhero. One that we havent seen before. Who knew we needed Michael Pena in the marvel universe? 79%",7,1,1,19 June 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Above average marvel
","Captain America is a little tongue and cheek, tastefully done. Throwback, intentionally old fashioned. Fun, means to set up captain America, and intro to his character and motivation, and now we are ready for the avengers. Succeeds on what it wanted to be. Could have been more. Keeps up recurring themes in marvel this far, like dips in the second half and boring love interests. But overall recommended. Neat set ups and hidden Easter eggs. 75%",7,0,0,6 June 2019
Captain America: Civil War," A Nation Divided
","Captain America: Civil War is so so messy in the best way. A nation divided. You can see both sides and sometimes it's so clear who is right. But people are right in the wrong way. And people are wrong in the right way. The darkest of the marvel films to this point. Everything that has happened is finally holding major weight. And now everything matters so much more. This is a superhero movie, but also a political adult film. It's like the superheros are maturing and being put into the real world and now have to deal with real world issues. Also Black Panther is a bad ass. This movie is so deep it could ruin friendships. The best marverl movie in this saga so far. 91%",9,0,2,22 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Avengers: s**t hits the fan
","Avengers: Infinty War is a great set up to the big finale for this saga. The characters meet each other and team up without it being forced, and the tone perfectly is set from the very beginning that s**t it hitting the fan. Thanos is not just evil, he genuinely believes hes making the world a better place. He needed to be the best villian of the series and he easily is. The things he does in this movie. Sheesh. This is his movie. These characters have come such a long way, and we got to be there for it all. Which makes it so hard to watch as they all fail, and inevitably fall. Theres tons going on but it's so well balanced. I love this chapter. The only thing I could say is some heros dont seem that strong or important but other than that...amazing. 90%",9,1,1,12 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Outlaw Avengers
","Guardians Of The Galaxy was a big risk Marvel take. Which is why they have always worked so well. They take big risks. This one paid off a million. Original characters, story telling, and execution. Amazing make up and costumes. Great chemistry, emotional connection and a hell of a soundtrack. The first time we get a glimpse into thanos's plan and scheme. With an actually memorable villian and off beat climax. But of course, Groot and Rocket steal the show. Pun intended. The lightest and also darkest of the films so far. Marvel always just seems one step ahead. Guardians of the Galaxy proves it. The outlaw avengers. 85%",8,1,1,13 June 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Blandtron
","Avengers Age of Ultron is a mess. Not as much as the dark world. But still a mess. Finds it difficult to strike a balance between story and bad guys vs. Good guys. Acrion gets a little mind numbing. James Spader does a fine job making a good villain. And Danny Elfman does what he always does, makes great superhero music. The two highlights of this film. It's a not quite darker entry. But more of a grey entry. It's a little bleek. And very grey. The main plot is Tony Stark messes up and 2 hours of them trying to fix it. Sets up the growing tension between stark and Cap well. Get us ready for Civil War. Just enough cool stuff happens to save it. 66%",6,1,2,16 June 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the galaxy back 2 Africa
","Guardians vol. 2 by far has the best opening of all the marvel movies. I could watch the opening for two hours and be totally content. The set pieces and colors are so clever and beautiful. The design of characters is fine art. The humor is stronger than the first mostly, sometimes the balance between dark drama and humor feels a little mismatched. And dare I say even the soundtrack is improved. All the characters feel like your friends, like you know them personally. And of course, acting legend Kurt Russel is a marvel villain force to be reckoned with. Shoot, Yondu proves to be one of the greatest marvel characters of all time here.
The great thing about this film is it's not so worried about setting up anything but just telling a story. Telling a story about the characters and letting you learn about them more and give you more of an emotional connection. James Gunn went all out on his trademark weirdness on this film, he truly claims it. It's even stranger than Doctor Strange. AND you get Sylvester Stallone in the marvel universe. What else could you really ask for. All the guardians are in full flux here. Theres no way you're not going to have a good time, and even possibly just feel something. Simply, it's just alot of fun. 87%",8,2,2,26 June 2019
Black Panther," Marvel's Creed 2
","Black Panther is a superhero movie with great emotional depth. Deep themes and exciting action. Its puts the black panther on the map for bad ass superheroes. It's a tale about redemption and maybe this is just because of Michael b Jordan but I saw themes from creed 2 or even rocky 3. Michael b Jordan does fine, his character is great but I dont think hes the best fit for a villian. The directing is the best highlight of the film, I am a big fan of Coogler and this helped his case even more so. Martin Freeman does great like always, and so does Danai Gurira and Boseman of course. Some jokes dont really work, but theres not really much else to complain about. The music is great too. It's about as good as the first iron man, and a tad worse than the winter soldier. 80%",8,1,5,3 July 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Thor: The Dark Mess
","Thor the dark world is by far the goofiest of the marvel films thus far. Also the most head scratching. It makes you wonder what they were trying to achieve and what was the point. It's a mishmash of all fantasy franchises before, themes of lord of the rings, star wars, game of thrones, and even pirates of the Caribbean. Its shot very dark with amazing looking villains who look extra evil. Irritatingly not used to their full potential. Being so dark they also shoehorn out of place humor that is confusing and mostly misses its mark. This film also has some of the best visuals and effects in the entire marvel universe. Loki is also at his best. Its wacky, goofy, and a complete mess. I recommend on the grounds to watch in awe. The worst of the marvel films to this point, but still worth sticking around for the odd unique mess it was. Oh, and confusing plot holes galore. 60%",6,0,0,10 June 2019
