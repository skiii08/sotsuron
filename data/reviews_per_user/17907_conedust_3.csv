Requiem for a Dream," Beautiful, brilliant and kinda boring
","I really wanted to like this movie.  I loved Pi and had been looking forward to see what (writer/director) Darren Aronofsky would come up with next. And for a while I was completely blown away by 'Requiem'.  The acting was wonderful and the cinematography and editing were absolutely incredible - kinetic, musical and truly unique.  Given it's stunning first hour, it should have been a great film.  But a thread of truly puritanical preachiness runs through 'Requiem' and after a while it comes to dominate the whole movie.Basically, this is a film about addiction, addiction to love, addiction to food, to habit, to memory, hope, approval, the future and of course addiction to drugs both legal and illegal.  The film doesn't distinguish much between these addictions, instead it layers them atop one another and allows them to reflect off of and inform one another.  We watch the central characters struggle with and against their consumptive, redemptive and addictive impulses and we witness the terrible toll these interlinked impulses exact upon their never more than pitiful lives.All four central characters are drawn in broad, bleak strokes: the gorgeous yet naive art-school girl, her equally naive street-rat boyfriend, the junkie boyfriend's junkie partner in crime and the boyfriend's diet-pill-popping, food and television obsessed mom.  Although the performances are uniformly excellent, the characters are thin shells who exist only to demonstrate their internal failings.  I admit they're exquisitely rendered shells, with far more detail and nuance than one usually sees in such cautionary tales, but in the end each character is a simple straw man, designed with only his or her own destruction in mind.That's the problem.  The central point ('addiction is bad') is simplistic, and its delivery is staggeringly ham-fisted.  Up to a point, I was willing to go along for the ride, led willingly by the truly spectacular eye-candy filling the screen and the exceptionally fine performances that drive the story forward, but after a while I just gave up.  I could see the end coming; I could see the Moral Message written in huge, black letters all over it, and I just didn't care any more.  Life is not a lesson.  Film can be, but don't we as an audience deserve a little more intellectual credit than that?What could have been an accessible yet experimental observation of the addict's life, presenting both the ups and downs, the good and bad with an eye toward observational truth (with a small t), instead sinks under the weight of it's embarrassingly fatuous and self-important missionary zeal (every single letter in boldface caps).  It's like one of those cautionary splatter movies from driver's ed or an after school special about the maladjusted girl who starts slipping a little of mom's vodka into her O.J. at lunch time.  Given the money, the talent and the effort expended, such reductive hectoring seems like a terrible waste.Watch it for the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, the very pretty young people with nice hair, and watch it for the performances, especially Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, but be prepared to be pummeled instructively for what feels like days.  (And the 'controversial' material in the unrated director's cut is so goddam silly and cheesy you might as well just watch the R-rated version.)",1,1,2,15 November 2001
The Mist," Barely Adequate Sci-Fi Horror
","What you have here is an old-fashioned survival horror movie in which ordinary citizens are pitted against giant squishy things from who knows where. A spooky mist rolls into town on an otherwise pleasant afternoon, and from it emerge tentacled horrors, trapping about 20 Mainers and vacationing summer people in a small supermarket. From there, they struggle, and that's the plot in a nutshell.Because it's based rather faithfully on a Stephen King novella, at least as much emphasis is placed on interpersonal character dynamics as on the bug nasties from dimension 7. Unfortunately, however, none of it rings true. Everything about the film feels stagy and two-dimensional. This is probably the fault of director Frank Darabont, who never met a treacly character clich√© he couldn't embrace fully. Meanwhile the invading beasties, while reasonably cool, aren't ever particularly frightening. Darabont is more concerned with mildly thrilling sci-fi action than with building suspense or delivering raw horror. Only in the film's final moments, when the true, Lovecraftian scale of the threat is finally revealed, do we really get a taste of anything genuinely dreadful.Overall, The Mist feels, more than anything else, like a better-than-average Sci-Fi channel production. You get the same blocky staging, unconvincing sets and obvious exposition. The same cardboard characters running through their cardboard histrionics. The same hokey digital monsters (though, admittedly, executed on a bigger budget than cable TV could ever manage). The only really interesting thing about the movie was the amount of time spent on a subplot involving a messianic crazy woman and her destabilizing effect on our intrepid little band of would-be survivors. This subplot, unfortunately, plays out in just as ham-fisted and obvious a manner as the rest of the film, so what might have been a neat little philosophical puzzle is flattened into a shrill, anti-Christian tirade.Despite it's many failings, The Mist's ending is its greatest sin. I'd have been perfectly happy if it had ended where King's story did, with our doomed heroes simply riding off into an unknown but unpromising future. Darabont, however, decided to wrap things up in a decidedly grim and Serling-esquire manner. I found the 'shocking' conclusion insultingly overstated, out of character and borderline senseless. 1/10, but there is one fantastic effects shot towards the end (you'll know it when you see it).",2,17,27,23 April 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Valhalla, My War Boys!
","I've seen the overstuffed toybox of my childhood pillaged for cinematic 'inspiration' so many times now that the prospect rarely offends or entices me. Star Trek, Star Wars, every cruddy horror movie ever to have graced a rented VHS tape. Take it all, you greedy bastards. Melt my cherished memories down for pocket change, see if I care. After the heartbreaking artistic faceplant that was Ridley Scott's misbegotten Prometheus, I'd pretty much given up on these sorts of refried treats. O, me of little faith! If anyone can tool up a bloody-knuckle, road-raging death machine out of junked parts, it's George 'Mad Max' Miller. Fresh from the theater, I feel like an overstressed carburetor into which some baldhead lunatic just spat a mouthful of pure nitro. The pitiless desert sun is blazing nova bright above, and it's a lovely, lovely day indeed. I caught Fury Road in 3-D, which was cool...mostly because I now get to go back and see it without the unnecessary dimensional enhancement. And again gaze vacantly into that stupendous vortex of crazy-ass, nonstop, man-machine mayhem like the sweaty, crack-brained adolescent I once was (and of course always will be). I don't know that I've EVER in my screen-staring LIFE seen a vehicular action flick half so relentlessly thrilling. And certainly not this side of The Road Warrior. The bug-splattered, silver-glossed, ear-to-ear grin Miller & Co. smacked across my idiot mug in the film's opening moments is still fixed in place several hours later. Turns out mom was right: my face is stuck this way.One minor quibble: Fury Road would be improved significantly were some sensible soul simply to take a small red pen to each scripted instance of the words 'hope' and 'redemption'. For a filmmaker whose visual storytelling has received such widespread praise, Miller sure lays on the thematic underlining with a hefty trowel. Some may accept Max and Furiosa's portentous small talk as appropriate to the tale's mythic ambitions. Me, I just found it kind of annoying, with the clunky sentimentalism tipping stoic gravitas into po-faced camp.But why fret over details? I mean, somebody who worked on this once- in-a-lifetime nightmare monsterpiece gets a screen credit for 'Wheels and Skulls'. How many other movies can you say that about?",9,23,40,16 May 2015
