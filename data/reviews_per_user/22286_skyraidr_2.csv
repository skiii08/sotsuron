The Blair Witch Project," very impressive
",Amazing little piece of filmmaking.  In the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft: what you can't see is much more frightening than what you can see.  No amount of expensive digital effects can equal the terror generated by this low-budget offering.,10,1,2,24 June 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Worthless piece of sh*t
","What a truly godawful movie.  The actors chew scenery in a manner that would put William Shatner to shame, the score consists of ruined, overproduced versions of songs, many of which sucked to begin with, and the direction is a non-stop bore-ride of empty gimmickry.  Even the much-lauded use of anachronism is unoriginal: see Ken Russell's 'Lisztomania' or Alex Cox's 'Walker' for examples of the technique that actually have some redeeming value, unlike 'Moulin Rouge'.A steaming pile of dogsh*t is still nasty, no matter how many bows and ribbons you tie around it.",1,3,7,14 October 2002
