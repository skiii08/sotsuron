Blade Runner 2049," Great Movie!
","Blade Runner is an amazing movie, with a great plot and incredible shots. It is a slow burner, but that does not take away anything about this movie, in fact, it makes it better, it takes the time it needs to compel the audience and create great characters. It is difficult to talk about both Blade Runner movies and not spoil them, so I will just say that Blade Runner 2049 is a great movie, and very smart, that said, I highly recommend it. More people should watch movies like this one so we can expect better movies from Hollywood and not only mind-numbing explosions without an actual plot. It's a great sequel that expands the Blade Runner Universe and improves it in many ways.Please watch this movie, it doesn't disappoint. 10/10",10,5,18,13 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Is it bad? No. Is it good? Well, it's not bad.
","I really wanted to like this movie, I really did, but the movie makes it extremely hard.
It is not an origins story, it is more interested in letting us know how Nick Fury got the Captain Marvel calling device we saw in the post-credits scene from Infinity War. By the end of the movie we still have no clue who Carol Danvers really is, she is extremely boring, I do not blame Brie Larson for this, she is an amazing actress, I blame the directors. They try really hard to make a feminist movie and forget to make a good one.
The chemistry between Fury and Danvers is great. I there are some scenes in where I found myself enjoying the movie, but a few good scenes make a good trailer, not a complete movie. In no way, in the entire movie, do I ever have an emotional connection with any character, and it's a huge problem. Still, it's not bad, it's just not good either.
It feels like this movie should belong in Phase 1, right next to Thor, Captain America, Thor 2, and Iron Man 2, just plain bland and not that memorable.
By all menas go see it and go make your own opinion.",7,1,7,8 March 2019
