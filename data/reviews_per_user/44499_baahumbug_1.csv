Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Believe it or not, 'Movie Magic' ruined it.
","Too many special effects!  I can't believe that I am reacting negatively to the 'movie magic' of George Lucas and crew.  The fact that something was computer enhanced in nearly every scene was distracting.  I kept looking at Jar Jar's feet being 'above' the other human actors.  He seemed to hover in every scene.The plot was a 'C' or very average at best.  After 20 years, I expected a lot more.",7,0,1,16 June 2000
