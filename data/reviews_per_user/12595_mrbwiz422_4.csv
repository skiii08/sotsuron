Ford v Ferrari," I never knew the wife was the real reason Ford won
","Movie would have been much better and about 30 minutes shorter if they removed the wife from it all, rather than shoving her in as they did.",7,0,1,6 January 2020
Baby Driver," Way over-hyped! Not a great or even good movie.
","Everyone's gushing about how the music matched a few scenes and I mean like.... Yeah? Welcome to movies, where sound is designed to match the scenes.There wasn't anything amazing.Bad acting from the main character. Bad writing as well, he makes a lot of stupid decisions which I suppose are the reason the story exists. Lazy and unrealistic writing. No chemistry between him and his 'love' who are in love and run away after a date which entails going for dinner and then ending. This girl must be lonely as hell despite being a good looking waitress. She wants to leave her job and her friends behind for a man she doesn't know at all, except that he's friends with some criminal elements... And she's like hell yeah lets do this!OH and I assume she remains celibate for 5 years for him at a point. Again... They have had one date and barely any conversation, and no nookie.Just a lot of terrible writing in this like that which bothered me. The action and music scenes were okay. You can find much better looking at any top-lists.",5,14,24,30 September 2017
Yesterday," An otherwise great/interesting movie ruined by a bad main character
","Main character wasn't written well and wasn't charismatic at allNot particularly nice or funny, not generous, not thankful or intelligent, not dependable, not courageous. I don't think there are any good qualities they show.... Struggling to think of one.It's hard to watch a movie this length with a main character who is entirely selfish and unlikable while all of the side characters in the movie bend over backwards for them despite being completely undeserving.Otherwise worth a watch.",6,0,0,23 September 2019
Call Me by Your Name," A middle-aged Hollywood director's wet dream
",About a 17 year old boy who will screw anythingFound it fairly unsettling how acceptable the relationship was made to be with how many claims have been made against middle aged male Hollywood directors sleeping with younger boys.,7,0,4,12 September 2018
