Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Menacing!
","I have to admit, I was skeptical about how this movie was going to turn out. I was blown away, I loved every moment of this movie. It is almost like the original Star Wars over again, Anakin is taken under the wing of Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and he learns about the Jedi. It was exciting to say the least. Darth Maul is a villain you love to hate. You also cannot help but feel like you know a lot of these characters from before somewhere. It was great to see some of our old favorites in action for the very first time! The movie was great that it also left a lot of important questions unanswered, it grips you and you can't wait for episodes II and III. We'll be waiting Lucas! 10 out of 10!!!!!",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Rocky IV," The fourth sequel, surprisingly with the most punch!
","What has Rocky been about? Rocky sums it up in this movie with the line 'Maybe this fights not against him... it's you against you,' I feel music is of prime importance to a film, I thought Vince DiCola's training montage and the ring music were absolutely brilliant. This film showed Rocky's passion more than ever, the human spirit is indomitable. Much of the film focused on Rocky's training, a hellish, and trying ordeal that would make someone wonder why Rocky could accomplish the impossible. The death of a loved friend set his soul ablaze, and he put out the fire in the end. It's a very emotional movie, I think it is the best of the Rocky series, with 3 coming in close behind.",10,3,5,27 February 1999
Rocky IV," Wonderful Installment
","The movie is great entertainment. I think it's the second best in the Rocky series. The First two were very good, but they were good for drama, and Rocky III and IV are entertaining, you have to forget about how old Rocky is. The movie is about his indomitable spirit, it's not about his anger. He lost A good friend. It is about revenge but it's not revenge in the heat of anger. That's what makes the movie is so good, while it may be unbelievable to most people it still is a great film.",10,2,3,1 January 2000
Independence Day," more MST3K fodder
","Oh yes this was really original! A movie about invaders blowing up planet earth! For what purpose? WHO THE HELL KNOWS??!?! I want to choke whoever mis-casted this mess that could have been slightly better. Will smith?? Come ON, he's not the type to be in a sci-fi film! I feel the same way about MIB. Bill Pullman is very poor at portraying the president. It's fairly predictable, holds no surprises, and contains some of the stupidest and dumbest catch phrases ever written, please do you really think after escaping an alien ship you would yell 'Elvis has left the building!!!' This Movie should be on MST3K, maybe eventually hollywood will learn not to sell out to 'Style'. * out of ********** :p",2,2,5,10 May 1999
