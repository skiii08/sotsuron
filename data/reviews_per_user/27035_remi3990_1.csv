Come and See," Come and See, very formalistic
","This movie had a lot of formalistic aspects to it where the snow symbolize the defeat of the nazi's and the sky symbolize the continuation of life and spirituality in the movie... This movie uses suspension of disbelief to give the audience the realistic sense that it is happening and that it did occur. Which gives the movie a more impactful sense to resonate the viewer to understand the cruel harsh world that the war brought to the innocent people who had to suffer at the hands of the nazi's. It was a good movie and had a lot of good points like when the protagonist was shooting at a photo of Hitler yet he had never killed anyone before in his life, so losing his family and all that had happened up until that point brought him to change and become like that.",9,1,1,7 June 2010
