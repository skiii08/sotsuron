Hereditary," This is way over hyped
",What on earth did I just watch? This is not scary at all and is complete nonsense. I only gave it a two for the acting otherwise I'd give it a one. Absolutely hated it. Made no sense whatsoever.,2,5,8,12 February 2020
Aladdin," What's with the high ratings
",This is the most horrible adaptation of aladdin ever. Now they are going to ruin the lion king.,1,137,250,12 June 2019
The Purge," The acting is terrible.
",I normally dont write up stuff on movies I just rate them but I had to for this one. The acting is actually very very bad. I have no words. And why is this focused on one family. The purge is about society. So boring I'm done typing. The director needs to purge himself,2,2,4,1 March 2019
