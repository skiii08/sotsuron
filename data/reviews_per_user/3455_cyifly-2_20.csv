Men in Black 3," Not bad... But disappointing
","Although MIB3 wasn't necessarily a 'bad' movie, it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been. It seemed, while watching the marketing plugs, like they were going to bring the big guns and bring back all the funny stuff and cool special effects, but they just fell short. The original was quite good -- Funny, a little scary, cool characters, good stunts, very original. Part II was just bad. So, if you are going to wait 10 years to do a three-quel that nobody really was dying to see because part 2 was so bad, then you better make part 3 REALLY good -- Right? Well -- It wasn't REALLY good. It was OK. I wanted to love it, but I honestly only barely liked it. It was lacking the things that made the franchise 'cool.' There was no talking pug, no funny pawn shop guy, no real interesting or funny aliens at all. The lead bad-guy alien was a somewhat interesting character, but no real personality. Nothing that made you want more of him. And other than him, there was hardly any other aliens in it. One little stint in a Chinese restaurant, but nothing rememorable. No funny ones. I just don't understand not making more characters like the ones that made the first such a hit. And even Wil Smith wasn't funny. He was funnier during his promotions on talk shows than in his movie. He just seemed to walk through the whole thing.ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to see it in 3D. None.I hate to say it -- But the special effects were awful. With technology today, most special effects are seamless. As an audience, we now 'expect' good effects. Half the time, it was very obvious when they were using backdrops and green screens and had super-imposed stuff. That's just a deal-breaker in today's movie-going world. The one truly redeeming quality it had -- and it was good -- was Josh Brolin playing the younger K (Tommy Lee Jones). He was spot on and did a great job. But even that isn't enough to carry a movie that wants to be a summer Blockbuster.Bottome Line -- Rent it. It's worth seeing if you have it lying around the house and have nothing to do, but not if you have to pay full price, and nothing you have to run right out and see.And this is from a fan of Wil Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin.",6,64,113,28 May 2012
It," IT Is Very Likely An Instant Horror Classic
","Horror movies have been having a hard time pleasing a lot of horror fans lately. There just has not been any kind of quality product in quite some time. 'It' very much changes that. It's been so long since we have had a good horror movie -- With great writing and acting, interesting characters and good direction all in the same film -- that this will likely be an instant horror classic.It's very well done. The clown is creepy, menacing, intimidating and scary as hell. Hats off to a job well done with that character. The kids and characters are all great. The story is well done and it keeps you interested, but there are several holes in it. Spoiler alert -- There is a clown in this movie and some people die. If you didn't know that, you are probably at the wrong movie. I'm going to mention it hereThere are a few things that left you scratching your head -- Like why nobody was asking questions about missing people or how certain characters got away with the very illegal actions. For example, one person kills another and no one explains how they plan to get away with it or why police are not involved. You can't just kill someone, leave them where they are, walk away and act like that was a normal thing that just happened and no one is going to care.My other problem was a hole in the story adaptation. I know from the book and from the 1990 version of IT, that the clown fed off of fear. Fear drives him, and nobody really explains it well like they should. It adds a depth to the story you can't just figure out on your own.But -- If those are the only two things I could find wrong, then I say they got IT right. Well done.",9,4,8,15 September 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Make sure you see this one in the theater.
","I'll start off by saying that this film was quite good, if you like horror films. If you don't like horror films or vampire stories, don't go see it and don't review it. It would be the same as seeing a children's movie knowing you don't like children's movies. Stick to what you know. I like vampire/horror movies. So I'm going to review it.I'm going to start by making one exception to the rest of my good review without giving too much away, of what I did NOT like about the movie: There is one scene, in the middle of the film, which was completely ridiculous. It was stupid and unnecessary and almost ruined the whole movie. It was meant to be a serious part of the film, and everybody was laughing out loud at how bad this small portion of the film was. It involves Abraham running and leaping from one fully-galloping horse to another, then a vampire throwing (literally) an 800-pound horse and hitting Lincoln with it. Not only can Lincoln act like a super hero for this one scene, but he can get up and dust himself off after being HIT WITH A HORSE like just tripped over his own feet. This was stupid and very overlooked by the director. He's not a super hero, nor a vampire, so it looked very out of place for the 'ordinary man' that he was trying to portray. It almost ruined the film. Almost. If you can overlook this one flaw, you have a good, entertaining film.With that out of the way -- The rest of the movie was great. It was well told, well acted and the special effects were fantastic. The 'Real D' 3D was awesome. They didn't throw a lot of things at you, but the depth of the picture was great. The action seemed to never stop. It was well worth the price of admission. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it certainly is a great way to entertain yourself for a few hours, as long as you don't take any of it too seriously.Most of all -- I applaud it for it's originality. The whole concept is very original as far as horror stories go.Bottom Line -- Go see it in the theater. Throw your expectation out, and just go with it and you'll have fun.",8,5,10,30 June 2012
Gravity," Nutshell Review: Gravity Is Something To Behold -- The New 3D Bar Has Been Set
","With one white-knuckle scene after another, 'Gravity' pulls you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until its' finale. It is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen, and not ponying up for the 3D, IMAX or XD does this movie a huge injustice. 'Gravity' is the reason these movie formats were made. The special effects are seamless and the sound effects are fantastic -- Even the brilliant use of silence. The story is gripping, touching, scary and thought- provoking, and the acting superb. I can't say enough about it, except you need to experience it. This isn't just a movie; it's a moment. Hat's off to the director for brilliant pacing. The film never drags and is exactly how long it needs to be. When I left, I was exhausted from holding my breath so much and running it longer may have taken some of that away.You've been bombarded with previews and read some reviews, but don't think anybody spoiled it for you. The story still has not been given away and if you think you know the movie because you have seen so many previews, you are very wrong. Not knowing how the movie turns out is a lot of the fun. It certainly is not predictable. Don't trust the bad reviews. Believe the hype. True -- There is no sinister bad guy nor creepy space monster. Outer space is the monster in this movie. It's part of what makes this movie seem so real. This is NOT a sci-fi movie. The space shuttle, satellites and the International Space Station are all real. There are no sci-fi, made up crafts. The props represent things really in outer space and that's part of it's scary draw. The story is not formulaic and laid out in front of you, but that is it's appeal. It is certainly there; it's just a story told in a very different way. It will certainly have you thinking and contemplating the important things in life.In a nutshell -- It's like a visually fantastic summer blockbuster with Oscar appeal. It's something you will be thinking about and talking about days after you see it, and what more can you ask of a movie?",10,5,12,8 October 2013
This Is the End," This Is Just Plain Bad
","I Like Seth Rogen. I like half of the rest of the cast enough to give this a shot. I really wanted to like this movie. But lets be honest... If you are over 14 years old (and the movie is rated R), the penis, sex, excreting, and drug-taking jokes just wear thin.I actually like raunchy, 'toilet' humor when it accents and peppers a movie and it's relatively unexpected. But when the entire movie is based on it, it makes the whole movie tiring after about a half hour. That's the ENTIRE movie. One big, long, boring pot-smoking penis joke.I did laugh, even out loud, a few times. That's how they got one of the 2 stars out of me. One star's worth of laughs does not make a good movie. The other star was for the creative way they let the audience play a 'guess the Hollywood Star' game through most of the movie with cameo appearances. That was somewhat entertaining. But there was literally NO PLOT. It was obvious the entire cast was making stuff up as they went along and nothing got edited. Several of the bad bantering seemed endless.This entire movie could have been done in a one-hour HBO special. It's two-hour length was over an hour too long to run the same joke. But, then Hollywood would not have made the $100 million they did off of this mess. People keep showing up, so they'll keep shoveling it out. It was painful to sit through. I figured with the people who are in it and the good reviews it got, that it had to get better. So I sat until the end and I shouldn't have. It had two good laughs at the end with some cameo appearances that made me laugh. But the agony I had to go through to get there was not worth the time nor brain cells it cost me. I think I literally got stupider.",2,16,35,6 October 2013
Us," Peele Is On A Roll
","After the surprise of Get Out, Jordan Peele tries thrilling us again with Us. A decent thriller with a few surprises. Is it as good as Get Out? No. But is it bad? Also no. You want to compare the two because they are written and directed by the same person and the first was so good and such a big, surprise hit. But -- You can't compare the two movies. They are both very different.Us has creepy characters, a few twists, some unexpected surprises. But it also has a very weird ending that I think turned a lot of people away from liking the film.
In my opinion, it was kind of cool to see something different than the norm. Us is not the best horror/thriller I've seen. But I've seen much worse.",7,1,1,24 September 2019
Oblivion," Had Potential... Went nowhere, then came back
","This is one of those movies which, after reading other reviews, I can understand why people either really liked it, or really didn't. I was in the middle.There were parts of it I really liked. The special effects and cinematography were great. The scenery, house and personal plane Cruise used were all interesting and fun as well.But -- Here is the kicker -- It's SLLOOooow. After almost an hour and a half into this film, you still don't know what it's about or where it's going. The last 20 or 30 minutes completely saves the film. All the stuff that was cool to look at wore off in the first hour, then I spent the next half hour bored. It actually winds up being pretty good later and it sums up the story and loose ends fairly nicely and becomes a whole lot more interesting.The problem is, it takes SOOOooo long to get there, that by the time you do, you have to wonder if you even care anymore. For my money, I like a story to engage me quicker than this one did.",6,0,2,28 September 2013
Dunkirk," To Put It Short and Sweet -- Go See Dunkirk on the Biggest Screen You Can Find
","If you love war movies, Dunkirk is surely one not to be missed. It's quite likely going to be an instant classic in the ranks of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and - most recently - Hacksaw Ridge. It will loose something if you try to watch it at home, no matter the quality of your home system. It's one of those films that really needs the big screen -- the bigger the better -- and best sound system you can find.With that said, the movie does have some flaws. Most of which I will give a pass and write it off as 'artistic,' and Christopher Nolan has earned that right. As I discuss the flaws, please understand that I really enjoyed the movie and strongly recommend it. Most of it was very well done. If I was to be petty and pick out what I think some others might not like, I would say most movies have a heavier, more distinctive plot. A beginning, introducing and developing the characters and setting up the plot; a middle, setting up the conflict the main characters will spend the movie solving; an end, where the main characters solve the conflict. If you need such a movie, then Dunkirk may not be for you, because the plot was not that clear. This was more like showing the audience an event than telling them a story -- An event that was hard, yet entertaining, to watch.The movie does have characters and somewhat of a plot, but they are not distinctive nor defined. The characters kind of run together and the plot is a bit unclear. The same scene unfolds slowly from three different points of view. From the view of an infantry group -- who are all basically the same height and build, same haircut and hair color, same uniform and mission. This is why they are difficult to tell apart when they are all running from some sort of peril during their screen time. Another points of view come from characters on a small boat and again in small planes and their characters are more distinctive, but never really developed either, because the plot is not really defined. Everyone just wants to survive and spends the whole movie trying to do so.And that is the basic plot -- Survival. Everyone is trying to survive this long war scene. The whole movie takes place in, what seems like, one afternoon. But, somehow, that plot works. It was obviously not written or directed to be a typical story in a typical movie. It's the same tense war scene shot from the perspective of three different groups of people, with no single, distinctive, main character, plot or point... And it worked perfectly.The scenes are shot so beautifully, that when you are with the infantry group, you feel like you were down in the dirt with them and want to dodging bullets. When the perspective would change, you got to see the same scene again, but from the air and the pilots' point of view and it felt like you were sitting in the tiny plane with them. When you watched the same scene from the boat crew's point of view, you could almost feel the boat shaking and the smell the sea salt. The shots are exquisite and details are fully thought out. You can hear the sand falling around your head, the gun chambers rattling the airplane and it seems you can reach below and touch the white caps of the ocean.The only real flaw for me was the story was not clearly set up. Unless you had prior knowledge of Dunkirk and it's history, you would have to have an explanation. I'll give a short explanation with no movie spoilers: The English went to help the French when Germany invaded during WWII. Germany was too strong and not only pushed the French to the coast, but the English right along with them. The Germans changed their strategy from fighting the French/English by shooting one bullet at a time to coming in from the sea with planes and bombing the troops at the beach, on piers and on boats -- intending to kill many more in one attempt, in hopes that they didn't go back to England and regroup. The movie quickly moves to the beach in the beginning and you or only given a quick blip of how they all really got there. For that, I gave it 9 out of 10. That is not giving away the movie -- There is so much more to this.The direction is great, the acting was on par and the special effects were seamless. If you are not a war movie fan, this will not change your mind, but Dunkirk will likely be around come awards season, and rightfully so.",9,7,12,28 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Epic In Every Way - A Fantastic Finish To An Extremely Long Saga
","Endgame was certainly the end of an amazing saga. Epic, touching, funny, sad. It has a little of everything. True - it's overly long, but if you are a fan of ANY of the characters, you really didn't want it to end. Beautifully done, Disney. You have my complete respect. You took something that could have been a few cheesy kid movies and made them enjoyable for most ages and ended it with great reflection. You hired great actors, writers, directors and made brilliant products - Bravo!",10,0,2,1 May 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Wow... What An Unexpected Ride
","Having never read the book, I didn't know what to expect next. Having read so many reviews, I did't either. Lot's of reviews were down right negative, calling the movie boring and long. Others called it a masterpiece. After being exhausted leaving the theatre, I lean towards the latter.If you find this movie boring, I think you need to go have your pulse checked. Either that, or you have just been desensitized from other things. It's extremely entertaining, full of action and even a bit scary quite a few times. There were a few parts - very few - that kind of dragged. But what movie doesn't. For most of the movie, it is edge-of-your-seat entertainment. There are great battle scenes, fantastic characters, seamless special effects and beautiful cinematography. The 3D depth is incredible and the best I've ever seen.Yes -- There are a few points to the story that could have gone quicker, but they were necessary parts to the story. If they were cut out altogether, the story would not make sense and you would be in constant sensory overload from all the action. There is so much action, your brain literally will need to take a break. Don't let reviews that pound that fact keep you from going to see it. I almost did and I'm glad my wife steered me away from those people to form my own opinion. I hate sitting in a movie that is deathly slow and overly long for no reason. This isn't one of those.As I said, I never read the book so I can't tell you if it followed exactly like the book. And, to be honest, I don't care if it did or not. Even if there wasn't a book, this is a brilliant, fun movie experience. I haven't been this entertained since Avatar.I think if you have the means, pony up and pay for the big screen (IMAX, XD, etc.) and the 3D. This not just a film... It's an experience and the screen, sound, and 3D makes it so. I saw it in HFR (High Film Rate) and can't tell you if that made a difference because I'd have to see it again without it to tell you. But if you can, see it with that too. You might as well go for it all, right? I would absolutely go see it again. The characters' voices are a little hard to understand at times (and I think at important times) and would like to get more of the plot.Bottom Line -- Go see it. It's not really for little kids, even though everyone says it's a 'Kids' Book.' It's quite scary. But most adults or teens would enjoy it. I went in with low expectations because of the user reviews I read here at IMDb, and was pleasantly surprised.",9,4,11,28 December 2012
The Dark Knight," The Best Comic Book Movie of All Time
","Hands down, the best comic book movie of all time. Everyone in it is brilliant. The acting, directing, writing, special effects, cinematography, and sound are wrapped up into one fantastic package. Even if you are not a comic book movie fan, you could enjoy it for the incredible action story all by itself. It's one to watch over and over.",10,0,0,10 October 2019
Elysium," In a nutshell -- Good Summer Popcorn Movie
","I found Elysium to be one of the better summer movies of 2013. It's no Academy Award winner, by any means. But it was briskly paced, had lots of action, a decent story, and the characters where good. Most of the special effects were well done, and the plot was engaging, although a little predictable.The only bad thing I would say about it, is Jody Foster's acting was horrible. Just horrible. I'm a Jody Foster fan. Even more so than Matt Damon, and I'm a guy. She just doesn't ever play a part poorly. I don't know if it was the director, the script or what it was -- But I'm going to give her a 'bye' this time, because she has done so brilliantly in the past. I did not know she was even capable of acting this poorly, but -- It happened.The rest of the cast was great. I wish the writer put in more of the humor which Matt Damon's character started the movie off with. It could have used a little more humor. But I sat with my eyes glued to the screen the whole time.Some of the 'critics' here are being way to harsh. It's not meant to be rocket science or completely flawless. It's a 'Popcorn Movie.' It's wasn't the best I've ever seen, but certainly worth your $10 and two hours. I had fun. I might even buy it.",8,0,1,28 September 2013
The Shape of Water," I Don't Get The Hype -- 13 Academy Award nominations? Really?
","I really wanted to like this. I tried to like it. I like everyone in it and associated with it very much. I just couldn't. I was lured in by the amount of Academy Award nominations it received. The acting was decent. The rest was just very basic and very weird. It was a very, very basic plot with an enormous amount of symbolism. If you didn't get the symbolism, you didn't really get the movie. Did you get it?Just not my type of show. I understand most movies. I had to have the symbolism explained. When I have to have that kind of stuff explained to try to make me like it more, you have already lost my interest. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good. Certainly not worthy of 13 Academy Award nominations. The movie industry is in real trouble if this is the best they can come up with. Most other years, this would not get a second look, much less a nomination. As much as I love everyone involved in this project, I didn't see a single winner.",5,6,11,20 February 2018
Sausage Party," So Bad, I walked out... and I never walk out.
","I loved the beginning of Seth Rogen's career. I love raunchy humor and adult cartoons. But... After the 10th 'let me put my sausage into your bun' sex joke, I was done. It wasn't REALLY funny the first time, much less the 10th. All the innuendos were VERY tired and overdone. I felt my brain melting and getting stupider the longer I sat there. I was embarrassed to even be seen in this theatre. Nowadays, I keep asking myself how Rogen keeps getting hired to make movies at all. He hasn't done anything funny in years. Then I look at the box office receipts and get my answer. LOTS of people actually pay money to watch this dude NOT be funny. He must have a HUGE following of 12-15 year old boys who sneak into the movies. Because I can't imagine anyone with any level of maturity liking this.Sausage Party was just plain bad. I wanted to like it. I was eager to watch. But this... I just don't have time for it. If I was a teenager, maybe. But I'm just not the core audience for this garbage. It made a lot of money, but I can't understand how. It seems like the intended audience shouldn't be old enough to buy tickets for a rated R movie.",3,5,11,11 December 2016
Joker," Joker Is Good. Phoenix is Amazing.
","Joker is a different take on a character done many times before. The whole movie is quite different than I remember the character being in any other comic book or movie, and you have to go with it. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as the afflicted Arthur Fleck. And watching him transform into the Joker character is very cool to watch. But, I feel the movie didn't go quite far enough into that next character. I thought surely it was going to end with his character being the Heath Ledger character at the beginning of The Dark Knight. It didn't quite make it there. Another movie? Probably... The movie was quite good, although it did drag in a few spots. It's a dark, slow-burning drama that does finally get to a boiling point. You just have to be patient and wait for it.If Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar nomination, I will be very surprised. Is he as remarkable or rememberable as Heath Ledger? Not quite. And you have to compare apples to apples. The two are portraying the same exact character in the same exact way. Yes, Heath did it better. But not a lot better. Ledger also had a more developed character to work with. Phoenix's character is just getting started at the end of the movie. Can't wait for the next one.",8,1,1,10 October 2019
Taken 2," Did anybody edit this movie?
","Taken was a surprisingly good film. Original, suspenseful, well-acted, well-written, well-directed. Taken 2 is about as original as it's title. It's fun, in parts. It's an OK way to kill a few hours. But it's not at all well-done. I'm wishing I went to Argo instead. There are so many editing errors that I don't even know where to begin. It's like they just threw this thing together and didn't put much effort or thought into it. Most of the characters seem to just walk through their lines. The dialog is forced and contrived. The writing is just plain bad. Even the bad guys have cheesy lines. If you need mindless entertainment, it's OK. If you are looking for a good sequel to a good movie (which didn't need a sequel), then this is not it.Spoilers ahead -- I'm going to name the BIGGEST, GROSSEST errors in editing that I have ever seen in a movie. These are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head: 1. The daughter fails a US driving test twice driving an 'easy' Camry with an automatic transmission. Later on she's driving a foreign car through the streets of a foreign country like a stunt driver -- with a stick-shift.2. The mother was cut in the neck (jugular) and left hanging upside down with a hood on to bleed out. Blood was coming through the hood. Liam said she was going to bleed out in less than 30 mins - meaning there was going to be a lot of blood if he didn't get to her. A whole body's worth... Later and through most of the rest of the movie, she's passed out from blood loss. When the hood comes off, no blood on her face or hair, and she doesn't bleed any more through the rest of the movie. She would not even need a Band-Aid with the little bit of blood on her cheek.3. The father tells the daughter to throw down her phone and run. She does, then she has her phone later.4. They drive through gunfire, a few vehicles, and a small building to get to the front lawn of the US Embassy. They had hit several vehicles and got broadsided by an SUV in the process. When they get to the Embassy lawn, not only are the guards not shooting anymore or rushing the car, the car doesn't even have a dent in it and Liam has time to make a phone call and has a lengthy conversation with his daughter.5. A moment after driving through the guard shack of the US Embassy, Liam is walking around town alone (not arrested or even questioned) looking for the bad guys.6. The giant briefcase in the hotel full of guns and grenades isn't explained -- At least I didn't catch it.7. The daughter detonates grenades on top of buildings in a populated city and no one even walks out or calls the police.8. Dad tells daughter to find him by 'looking for steam' and she finds him by coincidentally walking up to a rooftop metal pipe with steam coming out of it... like there aren't a hundred of those in a city like this? 9. With all the car chasing, grenades, gunfire and chaos, no police were seen in the whole movie.10. Liam is kidnapped with no jacket, then has a cool leather coat after escaping...Where did he get it?11. Vehicles were driving maybe 40mph, hitting each other practically head-on and magically flipping through the air.12. Isn't 11 enough? You pick one... I'm sure you would see some I didn't list. There has to be more.There were more -- This is just what I can remember off the top of my head. So many of them, it got to be funny and took away from the few redeeming qualities of the movie.Bottom Line -- I've seen worse. It's not horrible. But when I can spot such blatant editorial mistakes like this, it made me stop paying attention to the movie and looking for other mistakes -- Like a game. If you need time to kill, it's got some entertainment value. If you love Taken and are hoping for a good sequel, skip it. Don't even rent it. It isn't here.",5,0,0,18 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Ooooh, Soooo Gooood
","Let's get something everybody is asking out of the way up front -- Was it as good as The Dark Knight? Not quite -- Almost - But, damn close. So close that you should keep reading. You should watch this fantastic movie with just as much anticipation and pleasure as the last... It's that good.I am the reviewer that does not give away the whole story, but gives you 'The Bottom Line' at the end, and that will be later.I was wondering for months, like many others, in anticipation, if director Christopher Nolan could pull this off again. First doing a very decent dark-side reboot of Batman. Then getting wide recognition with The Dark Knight, then even more with the GREAT non-comic book film, Inception -- Can he pull off four in a row? Really? Yes he can. Without doubt. He has become my favorite director. Wooow... That man has talent. He has become a name I will pay big dollars just to watch anything he created.Rises is superb. Really. It's well acted, well written, and sooo intensely directed -- Thanks to the new Crowned Best Director - In my own awards show -- And who should be able to direct anything he wants to with a blank check from now on. I am usually good at picking out what is going to happen later in a movie, and there were several times I found myself saying, 'Well, I was not expecting that!' More than once in a film is rare for me.Don't misunderstand me, there are flaws. It's a little long... Others say - Especially with comic book die-hards that believe Wayne should have never been on a retirement to start with... But the few flaws there are might be my own eagerness for the film to move faster in some parts, even though it probably shouldn't. I found a few points a bit slow. But not for long. It was my own eagerness to 'get going again.' And it did. When it moves... It's fast and you better be ready. A few times, I actually said, 'Wooow.... How are they going to get Gotham out of that? That was new for me.I am a super-hero movie fan that does not love every super-hero movie. I am now willing to say that this series is my favorite. There is no way to do these films better. Even if they do another...Other reviews give away story points and plots; I'm just here to say that the very few flaws there are can be forgotten soon by the fantastic cast, crew and director because it is just extremely well done by every measure of any film. Nolan's noir is unique and should be regarded (by me) as the best of its' time.Bottom Line: Rush to the biggest, baddest, loudest theater you can find to watch it with anybody you know. You will love it and so will everyone else... young ones too (above 11). It's Dark, It's dreary, and somewhat scary. OOH..And Ooooh soooo GOOOOD. I do recommend re-watching the others in the franchise first, as they all play rolls for you to remember in the third, but it's not really required. Most movie fans will enjoy it, all comic book fans will love it, For the first time in years, I think I'm going to pay to see a movie twice in a movie theater. I took a 12-year old to it and he said it was the best movie ever. Happy movie going.",10,6,14,1 August 2012
The Purge," Original, Intriguing Concept Gets Lost With Terrible Writing and Directing
","The Purge is an interesting movie concept with poor direction. It was not a bad movie. It just was not very good. The idea of this American government implementing a system to let it's citizens purge themselves by dropping all laws for 12 hours once a year... is interesting. But then the movie gets started.The concept had my attention through the whole movie. It started off pretty well and it makes one think during the whole film that everything they are doing they entire time is legal. Intriguing. Then it just kinda went South about 30 or 40 minutes into it. There were so many times I said to myself, 'That would just never happen,' or 'Why didn't they just...' It was so often that it took the fun out of the movie.For example: The concept. The news flashes across the TV that this purge helps people to release their inner desire to break the law, so they don't do it any more for the rest of the year and crime is down drastically. Really? Criminals are still criminals. They have criminal minds and don't live outside the concept of not committing crimes. They would not 'be good' because they are allowed to be bad once a year.Saving the homeless man: If the dad was indeed afraid of their family's lives, he would not change his mind and start fighting and risk their lives. He would have thrown that guy out much earlierThe neighbors all turning bad: People don't just start killing because the opportunity arises. Lots of people are good people even if they are allowed to be bad. They neighbors storm the house in what looks like a rescue, but then are actually there to kill the family themselves just because their front door and security system were torn down. Right.Why wouldn't a rich man fly his family out of the country for a few days? It would be much safer and cheaper than staying.Why didn't the movie show you what was going on at all anywhere else? The whole country is purging and the whole movie takes place in one house. Lots of missed opportunities there.The other problem is the movie lacks reason. There is too much you have to 'just go with.' There was no real reason for anybody to do anything in the movie. There was no reason for the boyfriend to shoot the dad, no reason the gang could not find a different person to kill, no reason the dad should not have given the homeless guy back, no reason the teenage daughter stayed in a sexy Catholic school girl costume the whole movie, no reason the neighbors should hate this family and started killing, no reason for the creepy masks, etc, etc.What started out as a decent idea turned out to be a basic home invasion thriller. It just didn't have decent writing. The story set up was bad; half the dialog was cheesy or forced; the home-invasion part was something we had seen before. If you want to see good home invasion movies, try Straw Dogs, Your Next, The Strangers or Funny Games. The Purge was not as good as any of those.Bottom line: What could have been great was not executed well at all. There were far too many missed opportunities this idea could have gone with. It's adequate if you have time to kill but not great if you are looking for quality.",5,0,0,3 December 2013
The Nice Guys," Nice Surprise -- Go See It.
","I really enjoyed The Nice Guys. I think it's a solid hit with a miss of a title. That plus the lack of marketing kept a lot of people from seeing it -- Which is a shame, because this is one of the best of it's kind I've seen in a while. The leads were great. All the side characters had great parts. It was very funny, had plenty of action and character, clipped along at a decent pace and had an interesting plot -- although a little forced at the end. I'm considering watching it a second time because it had all kinds of small, subtle gems dropped in and I'm sure I missed some the first time. If you like Rated R comedy with a bit of action and violence, this is a hit. Go see it.",8,3,7,13 June 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Great True Storytelling - Mel Gibson Does It Again
","Hacksaw Ridge is the true story, told the Mel Gibson way, of Desmond Doss. He is the soldier who won a Medal of Honor in WWI and never touched a single weapon. Without giving too much of this story away, I'll just say his story was masterfully told in this superb movie.Finally, there is a movie which deserves Oscar attention. Andrew Garfield is wonderful in this movie. Gibson does an outstanding job directing and the final product does the story so much justice. Hacksaw Ridge ranks with the best war movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.The first half tells the story about how he came to the decision not to ever hold a weapon and his conviction to his commitment even though ridiculed, and the second half tells the story of his heroics at war without a weapon, when everyone else has one.I highly recommend the film. If you can take the violence of war movies, this great story will not disappoint. Everyone nominated for this film deserves the recognition.",9,3,6,29 January 2017
