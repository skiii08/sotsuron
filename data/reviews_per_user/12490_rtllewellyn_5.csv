Spartacus," They don't make then like this anymore
","I have watched this movie twice now and now I have Gladiator pales a little for me as there are scenes in this which are almost identical .I think this is a great old fashioned movie the plot is excellent the set although for its time is very good plush is a word I would use .What really strikes me about this movie though is the acting performances they are really good pieces of acting from the whole cast, Olivier, Douglas , Ustinov , Laughton , Curtis and Simmons they just blew me away at times and I am afraid to say it you do just not see that kind of acting and those kind of performances any longer .I give this an 8 the only drawback for me is that maybe it is a little long and could have been cut by about half an hour .It is still great though",8,1,3,1 January 2006
Hostel," Was this supposed to be horror
",I finally watched this last night my flat mate was desperate to watch it so he rented it . and I was intrigued to see what this was really all about as I had heard so much ......... Well it was poor and that is being kind it just featured lots of gore well that isn't horror is it its just somebody getting their kicks to my mind .Probably in all reality unfortunately there are places like this in the world as we have sickos like the one portrayed in this movie .To sum up this movie had no plot no suspense no seat clutching tight tense moments in fact to my mind it was just a poor sick comedy as the whole scene involving the American who escaped showed if you seen it you know what I am talking about it was ridiculous a Horror is a film along the lines of Alien thats a horror and a bloody great one as well this isn't its a parable for teenage boys,3,2,3,2 October 2006
Batman Begins," Not the usual superhero movie
","This is a great film I saw it at the cinema originally and was blown away I have just brought it on DVD and it is just as good . Firstly I am a big Batman fan and I thought the first two with Keaton directed by Burton were very good and then they went off the boil so when I knew they were going with it again but in a different direction I was very pleased . Christian Bale is excellent portraying a man coming to terms with his past and his anger and eventually becoming Batman wanting to do good and thats what Batman is a story of an guy who wants to achieve justice not vengeance . The whole movie isn't really to me a superhero film its just a story of a guy finding himself and then deciding to dress up as a bat .Everyone else is very good in this Oldman, Caine, Hauer, freeman all convey and add to the movie holmes is out of place .A really good addition to the franchise and I look forward to the second one",9,0,1,22 October 2005
War of the Worlds," blockbuster misplaced
","I think that this is a good film at the cinema I enjoyed it greatly, I also enjoyed the book and I think the book was better . This film did try and stay as true to the book as it could especially in the respect of Human civilisation being routed and posing the whole question that no matter what technology or how clever we think we are, that if aliens invaded or some other catastrophic events outside of our control happened we would be pretty well finished,it applied in 1897 when the book was written it applies now in 2005 and the advent of the film .I also liked the aspect that Tom Cruise character was just an ordinary guy just as scared as we would all be .The effects were great and the first sighting of one of the machines i found very sinister and eerie.The one problem is that unfortunately we live in the age of commercialism and Hollywood happy endings and for all my hope of a good movie staying true to the book and I was hoping set in Victorian England we have to have it in modern day America and we have to have rays son turning up at the end in an inexplicable manner.The film is good thats why I gave it 7 out 10 but for Speilburgs talent and there is plenty there are times I felt the same about A I that I really think he has to just add on a happy ending for no better reason then to sell cinema tickets.Good though just a little misplaced it trys to do the dark sparse undertones of the book its just that modern life doesn't want to see that on celluloid",7,0,1,24 October 2005
Cinderella Man," Moving and Inspiring
","I had wanted to watch this film for a long a while and finally did last night. I loved it this film had a snowball effect it just got better and more moving and more inspiring as the film went on .Russell Crowe turns in yet another great performance he always does,as a man who is courageous loving and humble plus a loving family man . Braddocks trainer is also performed brilliantly but the name of the actor escapes me I'm sorry . Renne Zellweeger is also very stoical as his loving devoted life .I just really loved the way that this film did not pull punches it showed how Braddock fell but never gave up hope and belief in himself or his family . and then finally he begins his remarkable rise back to the top of his boxing profession . The final bout between Baer and Braddock was one of the best shot film fights I think I have ever seen to me the whole film was a sort of symphony with the final fight being a crescendo and what a crescendo I was moved to tears at the end.A wonderful film",9,1,2,12 March 2006
