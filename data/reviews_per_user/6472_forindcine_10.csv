United 93," Little known facts about an important moment in U.S. history
","I've got to be honest; I had no desire to see this film after having watched the television version some time ago. However, my mind was changed after reading several reviews and hearing the opinions from several people I trust. I came to the conclusion that this film was much more than the well-known phrase 'let's roll' and associated actions everyone is familiar with. The film is set in 'real time' intended to mirror the actual time-line of events on this momentous day. The film's time is spent at various Air Traffic Control centers and a Military Command Center as the events involving all 4 aircraft evolve. Early in the film, much detail is spent on American flight 11, which gave the first indication that something was awfully wrong that day. As an American Airlines employee and being personally involved with the activities of that morning on September 11, 2001, it is no wonder that I would naturally become very interested in every detail of that flight as well as American flight 77 that was flown into the Pentagon.You will learn how the FAA struggled to determine which aircraft were in jeopardy and what lead to grounding of more than 4,000 aircraft over U.S. skies. You will watch as the military was both unprepared and unable to get F-15s in the air in time to be of any assistance. And finally you will see how the terrorists on United 93 were helpless as the passengers and crew on board plan their attack.This intense, extraordinary film is well worth seeing. You will gain insight to facts not known to most. You will be totally consumed by this film. Go see it!",8,0,0,23 October 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A laugh-out-loud comedy
","One of the unique things about independent cinema is, if you live outside the City of Angels, the Windy City or the Big Apple, you need to wait weeks before an 'indie' film comes to your area. These cities have the audience and are proved testing grounds for this type of cinema. Indie films thrive in disassociation with the large film studios because it would limit their ability to be unique and produce cinema that some might call controversial. Few copies are made until the film proves it can stand on its own. Once that happens we all get to see them. With the use of satellites the emerging digital film distribution systems should assist in making these films available faster in the coming years.Little Miss Sunshine has been playing to rave reviews in those cities for weeks but that doesn't necessarily make it a great film. You might remember the screenplay 'Brokeback Mountain' an indie film with a huge advertising budget yet the movie stunk up the place.'Little Miss' stands taller than the hype. It's a story about a father/grandfather thrown out of a nursing home; a dad who bets everything on his 8-step to success theory; a teenage son who decides not to speak; an uncle recently released from a psyche ward for trying to commit suicide over a gay lover; mom, the only sane one in the bunch; and little Olive wonderfully played by Abigail Breslin. The family decides to take a road trip in a VW bus from New Mexico to California to enter Olive in a JonBenet Ramsey type beauty pageant named, Little Miss Sunshine.It's a laugh-out-loud comedy which avoids every predictable humorous scene shown in so many comedy films. Instead of the predictable the film provides you with so many hilarious and unexpected surprises. Because you never know where it's going your enjoyment is greater. Near the end of the film you find yourself laughing so hard you can't hear the soundtrack but who cares the images are so funny that it's not needed.If you consider yourself straight-laced or think you have it all together chances are you won't enjoy this film. But if you're are like me - slightly twisted, partly dysfunctional, and can enjoy 101-minutes of steady laughter, you can't afford to wait to see this on DVD.",Null,1,4,23 October 2006
The White Ribbon," A masterpiece
","Director Michael Haneke's film 'The White Ribbon' is a brilliantly paced slow burn into the secrets of a small town somewhere in north Germany.

His two kids lost their mother in a mysterious death 5 years earlier, which resulted in the town's midwife looking after the children as the doctor spends months in recovery in an out-of- town hospital.The spiritual leader of the community, a Protestant pastor is a strict, guilt-slinging father of 5 kids for which he provides severe punishment so they become 'pure' adults. You have the Baron and wife who are disliked by most as they employ about half the town. They too have dirty secrets. The Barons steward and his wife and kids struggle as he tries to keep his family in line.Adults start dying, children are tortured, yet no one can find the culprits. The story is narrated by the schoolteacher, a new town resident, who recalls the story years after the war to the best of his recollection.

The Hurt Locker," Best modern war film to hit the big screen in years..........
","Shortly after my drafted, eldest brother returned from Vietnam he encouraged me not to go anywhere near the Armed Forces. I took his advice.Instead, I'm a fifty-something year old who has viewed WWI, WWII, Korean, Vietnam and the recent middle-eastern conflicts on television and the big screen. Each story does its best to share what life is like for so many soldiers in the heat of battle. Five minutes into this film my wife leans over to whisper, 'this doesn't feel like a film.' She was right – it wasn't just a film it was an experience.After watching 'The Hurt Locker' I slowly walked out of the theater feeling for the first time I gained a far deeper understanding of what battle is like in current wars. It's an experience so many men and woman should bathe themselves in to better understand words like dedication, honor, liberty and freedom. 'The Hurt Locker' is a film surrounding three men, aged twenty-something, whose job is to disable improvised explosive devices (IEDs), found on roadsides, buildings or anywhere they can kill or immobilize their targets. While other soldiers find shelter this team walks up to the device, finds the trigger and attempts to render it useless. They do all this while knowing the many locals who peer through doorways, windows and rooftops could be holding the trigger. This film puts you dead in the middle of this team as you too count the number of days left before your unit is rotated out of hell. 'The Hurt Locker' is not a violent or graphically difficult film to watch. It's an extremely intense, real-life drama that may stay with you long after you leave the theater. I encourage everyone to seek out this film. If you can't, please recommend that others see it. They will gain insight to a world experienced by few.",8,1,4,8 August 2009
World Trade Center," Two survivor and family stories
","Oliver Stone's film, World Trade Center, is a story about the rescue of two New York Port Authority cops who get trapped in the rubble after the collapse of towers one and two. Michael Pena, the Latino locksmith from the film Crash, plays Will Jimeno who is trapped with Sergeant John McLoughlin portrayed in a beautifully understated role by Nicholas Cage. In this carefully based, true story film, Jimeno volunteers to partner with McLoughlin as they enter the WTC to assist in the evacuation. Before they get off the ground floor, Tower One implodes instantly killing most members of their first response team. The two end up wedged between debris with no hope of freeing themselves. Stone does an exceptional job sticking to the facts without unnecessary play on your emotions. He effectively switches from scenes of the two trapped under the WTC to their families and wives in superb performances by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal. His masterful directing ability weave timely transitions and laugh-out-loud humor even as you wipe away tears.This film has great actors who portray the real lives of rescuers, victims, and family. Everyone involved with this film understands the story is about the 18th and 19th of only 20 victims rescued from the WTC wreckage. Jimeno is magnificent as he carries this film with little effort. Cage spends much of the film shown from the neck up yet provides the best performance of his career. Stone leaves all conspiracy theories behind and once again demonstrates what keeps him in a class by himself.This World Trade Center film is a masterpiece.",8,1,4,23 October 2006
Blood Diamond," Another fine piece by director Edward Zwick
","A few years back I had the pleasure of visiting Antwerp, Belgium, a place many deem 'the diamond capital of the world.' Never before or since have I been in a location where I was surrounded by so much 'bling'. Storefronts had so many diamonds on display you would think they should be better kept in some European version of Fort Knox.The film Blood Diamond puts an entirely new spin on Antwerp, the diamond industry and that pricey stone you might be wearing around your neck, on your ring finger, or in your ears (mine are cubic-Zs). Set in the West African country of Sierra Leone during the 1990s, this historical-adventure-drama covers a time when the country was in turmoil. Warlords, smugglers and the diamond syndicate all play roles in a refugee exodus, and the killing and enslaving of men to work the diamond fields. The title refers to diamonds which are harvested, smuggled and traded to finance the purchase of weapons used in Civil War.Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) stars as a fisherman who has his family torn apart and instead of being killed, is sent to work mining diamonds where he finds and hides a large stone. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former mercenary, diamond-smuggler, middleman, you-name-it, is looking to score with that stone and exit the business for good. Writer Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is tired of writing shallow stories about less than newsworthy events; she is looking for information about major players in the diamond trade. They all come together in a fast paced, adventure packed piece of film-making that is brutal at times but never boring. The film has a pleasant, unanticipated ending, something hard to pull off in a film of this kind.Director/Producer Edward Zwick is probably the best in Hollywood at taking a big budget feature film with a historical theme and carefully relay a message without lecturing his audience. His earlier works include a story of the first all-black U.S. Civil War company in 'Glory' a film, which resulted in Denzel Washington winning his first Oscar. Zwick takes credit for works like The Last Samurai, Shakespeare in Love, Traffic and Courage Under Fire. He is second to no one when it comes to balancing a historical event with action-drama entertainment. Edward Zwick is one of few L.A. directors who still works within the Hollywood establishment yet is able to put out good quality film. Check out Blood Diamond, your 'bling' may never look the same again.",8,160,223,9 December 2006
The Departed," Scorsese has done it again!
","Director Martin Scorsese has done it again. In the 70s through 90s he was the mastermind behind the films Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ the epic Kundun and the great Goodfellas. In the last 5 years he's spent time directing, Gangs of New York, The Aviator and now - The Departed. Scorsese is the kind of director; character actors rush, hope and pray for an opportunity to work with. Watch any film in his extensive filmography and you will understand in an instant.The Departed is a story about two informants in the Massachusetts State Police department who work for and against the Boston mafia. The film includes a laundry list of supporting actors. They include Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Martin Sheen but it leads with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and my man Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon performs another solid role as the mob mole working in a special task force inside the state police. Nicholson plays 'himself' as the dangerous Irish mob boss but he has finally re-invented himself into a dangerous, believable and refreshing character - imagine that. Then we have DiCaprio, one of the best male actors on from the left-coast. Scorsese starred him in 'Gangs,' trusted him to play the mysterious Howard Hughes in the 'Aviator' and has him sneak around inside Nicholson's mob in this thriller. Dicaprio is completely convincing as he moves in circles, unable to trust anyone.Departed places you in the middle of a world filled with murder and much aggression, all necessary to convey this intense story. The film is easily followed but full of credible twists and turns. Scorsese introduces a new character that should be given a Best Supporting nod if only it had a heart. He has taken our modern day convenience, the cell phone and turned it into a character never before seen on screen. As with any mob film, there is plenty violence but don't let that deter you from seeing one of the best films this year.",8,0,0,23 October 2006
The Queen," Mirren is amazing as the Queen of England
","It didn't take long after meeting my wife to find she was an admirer of Princess Diana. Considering Diana's good looks, fashion sense, humanitarian work and popularity it was easy to understand her worldwide appeal.With that in mind, on a weekend morning in August 1997, I crawled out of bed, turned on the 'telly' to hear breaking news of a major car accident involving Lady Di in Paris. Knowing my wife would never forgive me for not waking her up, - I did. For the remainder of that morning and early afternoon we sat glued to our television trying to gain whatever information became available.This film is an intimate look at how the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II, had difficulty juggling her personal sentiments, royal tradition, and the feelings of her British subjects as the death of Lady Diana stuns all of England and the world.I'm no expert on British royalty, however Helen Mirren* blew me away as the Queen. Her presence, her stiff upper lip, quiet grace, and overall royal behavior were pleasing to watch. She was able to manage this difficult role yet show a Queen who is not perfect, but was able to realize that fact and adjust to the needs of her people.Mirren's performance is already generating lots of Oscar talk about a nod for Best Actress in a Leading role. After watching this film, I would have to agree.",9,2,4,11 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody's best work in years!!
","I've always been a fan of Woody Allen's ability to write. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is probably Woody's best work in years. His film stars Vicky (Rebecca Hall) who early in the film fills the screen with prudish discussion and her love for her fiancée. Then there is Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) who is openly trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. The anchors in this film are Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), fresh from his Oscar win for 'No Country For Old Men', his fiery ex-wife Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) and the stunning city of Barcelona.The screenplay starts with a slow narration where we find American tourists and best friends, Vicky & Cristina, having just arrived in Barcelona to spend 2-months in the beautiful, gorgeous, Catalonian city. The two quickly meet the high-flying, sexy artist Juan Antonio who invites them for a long weekend while pointing out he would enjoy their company in bed. Vicky is insulted while Cristina is interested and very much attracted to Juan Antonio. The film hastens when Cristina & Juan Antonio convince Vicky to come along. The acting and dialogue are fresh, funny and unpredictable. Maria Elena steals the show when she surprisingly shows up and keeps you guessing throughout the film. The chemistry and timing are impeccable; all this reminding you of the Woody of old. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a romantic comedy set in a most beautiful part of the world with an excellent script, spicy soundtrack and amazing twists and turns. The film is wonderfully entertaining and truly a feast for the eyes. Don't miss it!",8,3,8,14 September 2008
