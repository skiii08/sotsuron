Ali," Will Smith is an interesting choice..
","I know this movie came out nearly 20 years ago, but I recently re watched it, and wanted to share my thoughts. First off, if you've never seen it, and like Ali, it is definitely worth watching. Production and directing are both really well done. It does feel a tad bit too long, and can feel dragged out in different scenes. All in all, the acting is pretty good, especially Jamie Foxx. I didn't love Will Smith cast as Ali. Throughout most of the movie it definitely felt like you were watching Will Smith play Muhammad Ali, rather than trying to see it through Ali's eyes. In some scenes where he had to act cocky, and confident, it reminded me of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. The boxing scenes were definitely Smith's strong suit. All in all though, like I said if you're interested, it's definitely worth the watch.",6,1,1,7 February 2020
Midsommar," Interesting
","Fantastic acting, gorgeous cinematography, really well written.  it's a little slow, very disturbing images throughout, and the sex scene is highly sensitive. It's a dark movie altogether, cinema lovers will enjoy it.",6,0,1,10 July 2019
