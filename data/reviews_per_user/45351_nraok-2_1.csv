3:10 to Yuma," Bigger stretch than the original
","When I saw the original fifty years ago,and a time or two since, I felt the story had a bit of plausibility to it. This remake doesn't even try to flirt with reality. There is no character development whatsoever, little interaction of personalities, just a whole lot of bloody violent murder for the apparent sake of audience titillation. Attempts to add twists and new situations to this version fall flat and do nothing to alleviate the lack of credibility here. It is difficult to provide examples, which would be numerous, of the silliness in the plot segments without an eruption of spoilers. Suffice to say that the last few minutes, a complete diversion from the '57 film, is an almost laughable conclusion but an appropriate one for what precedes it. Peter Fonda must have been in dire need of a new pool liner to have signed on for this one. Bad decision, Ulee!",2,2,6,28 February 2008
