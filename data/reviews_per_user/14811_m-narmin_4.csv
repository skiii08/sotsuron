Your Name.," Much deeper than just a fantasy
","Fascinating story. At first, it gives you an impression that this is yet another story on switch of bodies while time traveling (like '17 again' or '13 going on 30'), but it is so much more! 'Your name' is objectively one of the greatest educative (!) stories about love.
By using the Musubi legend and the worldwide favorite 'red rope' theory, the movie teaches that the right person is settled in your mind much earlier before you actually meet, probably from your birth, and you'll feel the lack of his/her presence on daily basis until the day you finally meet. The story teaches us that no matter what, the unvisible red rope (well, the visible one in this anime) will unite you one day and you will understand that this is the ONE by one simple glance.
The most significant lesson that beautiful story teaches us is to hear your heart and trust those magical visions, which are sent to you from the Universe through dreams in the past or stories you've heard once and which are stuck in your head for no reason.
But the reason always exists! Wait for that special person.",10,1,2,25 September 2018
12 Angry Men," Must watch classics
","Briefly, I'd go for promoting and including this movie to the educational programme in law schools and debate societies at universities all over the country. What a sophisticated yet easy way to show the essence of argumentation and objectivity!
All a student who is about to watch this needs to have is a bit of patience, because in an era of action-full movies not every youngster will attentively sit and watch 12 adult men arguing in a small room, sweating like hell for an hour and a half, moreover in a black-and-white picture:D",10,0,0,1 October 2018
The Secret in Their Eyes," Perfecci√≥n
","I am speechless. Literally out of words. Pardon my upcoming emotional rollercoaster. No eloquence or compliments would be enough for this masterpiece. The true detective, the storyline, the perfect friendship of non-perfect humans, beautiful scenes, the real face of revenge and the love as it is. 
As a junior lawyer, Irene's skills and her character stole my heart. But even when I get older this movie will remain as my top 5. 
I might be too romantic, but I am left with thought that the movie took its name not from the eyes of Gomez staring at his victim on group photos, but from the way Irene and Benjamin lovingly look at each other.
Oh my, this is the best movie about literally everything I need to see in a movie.",10,3,3,9 October 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Smart satire on 'mutual assured destruction' for a sophisticated spectator
","Did this movie fueled hippies with motivation and passion to do what they did?
Nevertheless, as a citizen of the former Soviet Republic, it was simply hilarious to watch an American movie (made during the pique of Cold War, which deserves additional applause to the crew) portraying that the situation and people's common belief was nearly the same even overseas: the belief that the 'enemy is near and is gonna kill all of us one way or another'. 
Jack Ripper reminded me so many acquaintances of mine who lived back in days!:D Impervious, harsh, brutal, passionately believing in his own truth and sort of a satiric character for all of the listed above. The only difference is that their favorite line was: 'It's all America again', but in the movie you can watch the vice versa.
Great movie, yet, the question got me thinking: did both parties actually enjoy dropping another war using force and guns less than a couple of decades after the hell on Earth called WW2?
P.S. The fictional president of the US being the most sane character of the movie probably 'saved' its reputation back in times IMHO:)
P.P.S. Spoiler: get ready for the then existing post-WW2 stereotypes about super cold and *still-kinda-nazi* Germans, cynical yet *cowboy-minded' Americans and always up for a drink Russians :D",9,6,8,8 October 2018
