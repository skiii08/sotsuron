Come and See," The boy is annoying. Atrocious editing and cinematography
",I can't stand watching this film. The boy is super annoying to the fullest with all of laughing and crying. I lost all interest at a middle of story if there is a story at all.I can't believe this is in top 250. Such an overrated film with atrocious editing more like a raw footage that contains dudes yelling at each other for 2 and half hours.Maybe this is an art film at best but come on shooting animal without a reason also does it for me.,3,0,2,8 May 2020
Your Name.," This is literary the best movie ever made.
","I can't describe all I feel about this movie in words. How the creator of this movie wrote the plot? It is unbelievable what I just saw.This movie just made by an everything that perfect. I do not want to tell the story but I want to tell you that I cried really really hard for 2 times in this movie. Because it is so beautiful and yet much tragedy in same time.But in the end I cried even harder. A must see for every movie lovers in the world.Another thing, this movie reminds me of how I love Evangelion series and movies. It is intense and well made. An astoundingly amazing movie.",10,13,23,12 November 2016
12 Years a Slave," Uncomfortable to watch and unnecessary depress
","Weird direction of bio-pic film, I guess the director wanted us to feel the pain of them. I don't find the ending sinks in my heart. I felt numb and nothingness.Anyway it's such a weird experience from this film. Some scenes are quite nice.",6,1,2,30 April 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," What an insane ride, the greatest ever action movie on earth!
","The whole time I had watched in the cinema is like, what! how can they make such a fine action movie like this.
The cinematography is one of the best ever if not the best ever. The story is simple yet deep because of all characters are so real. It may looks like a fantasy theme but I think this may be our future of us.
So this is all about our probably future if we are continue doing dirty things to the earth..",10,2,5,3 January 2020
