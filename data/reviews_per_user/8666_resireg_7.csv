It," Worst remake ever! Stick to the 1990 version.
","I did not have fun watching 'IT' at all. First of all, I could not sympathyze with any of the characters/protagonists. Second, there is no horror at all. The movie does not make you scared of Pennywise. Third, the situations are very unreal, like people killing theirnown parents and nothing happening afterwards. And last, the movie is just too long. In the end, they even gives us spoilers teloingnis that there will be a sequel.Those teenagers were all risking their lives in supposedly dangerous situations and suddenly someone would say ' it is summer, wer re kids and we are supposed to be outside!'. Who cares about that when there is a crazy monster chasing you?I hated it",1,2,5,4 September 2019
The Death of Stalin," Educational and fundamental history
","I am disappointed about how few cold war movies are made. It was such a long period of time 1945-1991, that it deserves to be more explained and studied. Essentially the movie covers the period shortly before and the afterwards following Stalin (the soviet dictator) death in the 50s. There is a power struggle, and apparently all intelligent and independent thinkingn in Russia has vanished (there is a scene where they observe that all good doctors were executed). We understand how the Russia of today is such a brainwashed nation. It is because genration after generation, people was trained to worship the rulers who were torturing and murdering them (in the movie, the victims pledge allegiance to Stalin before being shot to death by his thugs).The paranoia is constant, and normally the people with power would send to die their own friends ot family, just to show loyalty to the party. It is crazy, but it was the reality. Nowadays, if you talk to any Russian, he would say that those times were great, but that collective a,nesia, ignores the fact that anyone who was not supportive of the regime, woupd 'vanish', so the majority that remained alive was the hardcore supporters, and the ordinary people who adapts to any situation in order to survive.Schools shpuld be showing this movie in history class, so the new generations could learn what it meant to live under the worst refime in the 20th century. It is totalitarianism, but with the point of view of the bigwigs",10,0,0,28 March 2019
Fury," Another unrealistic propaganda
","Well, I am a fan of histrory, and I was expecting some good war movie like Platoon, Apocalypse Now or Thin Red Line. Fury is a big disappointment. Essentially it tells us a story a tank crew of 5 soldiers during the last months of the American invasion of Europe. Those soldiers are just invincible champions who essentially kill thousands and thousands of enemy combatants whithout making any mistakes, while the Germans are shown as a bunch of incompetent weaklings who never hit their targets, and when confronting a stronger enemy, (like 'Fury', the war tank that gives the movie its name), instead of approaching cautiously, and trying to minimize their casualties, what they do is just marching towards it and getting wiped out by the tank's machine gun.I don't understand how come such imbeciles could offer any resistance. And they don't explain how the war lasted so long with such an easy foe. The real reason they lost was that they were numerically outnumbered, and were lacking supplies and military equipment. It is just plain brainwashing, trying to portrait the American soldier as brave and ruthless, sinxe they essentially murder unarmed prisoners of war just for pleasure. It is funny that if it was that easy, the Vietnam war would ended with an American war. The movie 'Fury' feels like a tool for convincing tje audience to support adventures abroad (like we saw recently in Iraq), since the U.S. military always know what is doing, and the foreing populations are not composed of human beings, but just irrational animals who deserve to be killed. I think this film could be misused by a government that wants to re-write history. There is only 2 German actresses in the movie who are not shown in a negative light, and obviously both of them die because the point is that if you are German, you deserve to be punished. It is so much sadism,so much unnecessary killing that I don't understand why in real life Germans were defecting to the American side instead of the Russian side. Fury is so innacurate an illogical that I will not recommend to anyone I know. I prefer 'letters from iwo jima' by Clint Eastwood, or 'USS Indianapolis' by Mario Van Peebles as better examples of realistoc war movies that portays blth sides as human.",1,8,14,11 February 2018
American Psycho," 80s nostalgia
","The movie is essentially a portrait of the yuppie life in Manhattan during the late 80s. The main character is super rich, but he does nothing productive all day long. He exercises, go to his office to watch TV or listen music. He has a secretary whose only job is schedule happy hours, lunches and dinners with fellow millionaires, and at night they all go to nightclubs to do some cocaine and the night ends with them having sex with supermodels, only to repeat that routine again and again. Apparently our main character becomes bored, and start experimenting in order to change his life, for the worse",10,2,2,23 October 2019
Jurassic World," Worst movie ever
","I don't know where to start. Everything in this mlvie is awful. The maverick wearing a Han Solo vest, the incompetent and irrational CEO, the security who cannot secure themselves, nothing makes sense in this movie. People are dying, but nobody acts. There is no emrgency training, no worst case scenario. It is crap!",1,0,1,22 February 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Worst remake ever!
","I loved the 1974 version of that story directed by Sidney Lumet. Back then, the stroy was plausible, and the characters were interesting and the plot males sense. In the 2017 version, I was expecting to see the same characters, but unfortunately some were simply replaced in prder to fill some affirmative action quota I imagine.The historical innacuracies are immense, for example the fact that you had black and white interracial couple on the train, and the black man was a 'respectable' doctor who was some sort of soldier before. The strory doesn't fit, since in order to go to medical school (which was way more elitist back then), you needed years on prep school or private tutoring. Besides, there were black doctors in the US, bit they were part of an elite, and attended the Historical Black colleges and Universities. Talking about affirmative atcion in tye movie, in the end we see a very dark skinned black soldier posing as Yugoslavian, a nation so intolerant that they were killing their own neighbours because of a different accent (most recently in the 90s, especially Bosnia).Then, we had a Hungarian Prince married to a Jewess girl, when in nobility, we know that interreligious weddings are gery often forbidden (in the UK, there are rules against an Anglican marrying a Catholic for example). That didn't happened then, and even nowadays there ar no incidents of interfaith families in the high nobility (by the room he got, we see the prince was a hot shot).Then there are the German bashing moment that every Hollywood movie insist when in the year 1934, the country was still a democracy, and the references to 'the war' are annoyingly every minute, when Agatha Christie's books deal mostly with the upper classes, who are not involved in conflicts.Again, the director includes some token characters: a mexican chauffer, a german assistant, and a Russian countess, who were almost absent from the plot, and could be better used. There are action scenes that are totally unnecessary.
In short, the movie sucks!",1,2,4,4 November 2019
Da 5 Bloods," I couldn't finish. Too silly.
","I don't know where to start. So many stereotypes. A French guy who dresses like and lives in a building just like the 1950s. Too many political references of the present (in 5 years they will be old), characters that you don't care about, the movie is just awful.",2,3,8,17 June 2020
