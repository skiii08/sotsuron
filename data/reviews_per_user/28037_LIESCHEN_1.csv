The Blair Witch Project," Yikes!! There go my early morning walks in my neighbourhood park.
","I came into the theatre with no expectations for this movie and was left stunned when it was over. My husband and I sat in a fully packed theatre in utter silence and with bated breath until it was over. The filming style is a little hard on the eyes but if you have patience to sit through it you will be well rewarded.  Throughout the movie, I got the distinct impression that the actors weren't  acting, and that it was the real thing.  That I was there with them experiencing the whole thing.  I've never been caught up in a movie like that.  The ending is left up to the imagination, and I had a little trouble coming to my own conclusions.  After checking out some of the web sites I understood the movie a little bit better.  Brilliant filming and a must see for those who enjoy something with less gore and more on the suspense. I'm definitely going to see it a second time",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
