The Blair Witch Project," absolutely intense and terrifying
","This movie was great.It's definite strong points were the eerie atmosphere and intense acting,if you want to call it acting;by that I mean it seems straight up real without a flaw.It's incredibly real,if you knew nothing of the movie you would absolutely think that it's real.Another thing that was great about it was the way you don't just see their fear you feel their fear by being able to hear them tremble,pant,and cry.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
