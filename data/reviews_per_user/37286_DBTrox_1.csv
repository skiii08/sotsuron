The Blair Witch Project," great horror movie
","I thought this was a really original horror movie.  I had trouble deciding if it should be considered a movie or a prank.  When you watch this movie, you feel involved with the characters because they act so naturally. Afterwards i thought that it would be an ultimate prank to show your friends, if they somehow didn't hear all of the hype.  It's the kind of movie that would be fun to watch by yourself or invite a bunch of friends over for a scare.I really enjoyed the fact that the horror is all in your mind. There are no graphic images, no special effects, and no murders shown on camera.  What makes the movie scary is the way that the cast convinces you that they are truly scared and confused.",9,1,2,13 July 1999
