Requiem for a Dream," Dream and reality all in one
","The poster of the film resumes what the film is in a metaphorical way. Wee see a beautiful eye, but even though of its beauty, is filled with sorrow, and that's because its dreams just went away and with them, its freedom and happiness. We see the ocean at the back reminding us how dreams come and go like waves, and how they shatter when they hit the shore just like dreams do when they hit reality.This film is like a bucket full of ice and acid thrown at your face while you were sleeping and having the most beautiful dream you've ever had. It's like waking up to the real world after being distracted from it all your life by a silk curtain that suddenly falls and the truth is discovered in the most brutal manner.What are dreams? Can you live your whole life based on dreams and never realize the truth even if it is just in front of you? How hard is to lose those dreams and begin to live life, as it is, brutal, rude and fast? All this questions are answered in this film. A film that stands up from all the films of its kind I've ever seen in my whole life.Notwithstanding of its crudeness, is filled with beauty, color and hope. Hope is the last you lose at times of adversity, and this is proven by the characters of the film, who are incredibly well portrayed by Ellen Byrstein, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and one of the Wayans Bros.
This film is a complete new experience, but not a very pleasant one, is one of those films that you love or hate, but nothing in between. A film that I don't think I would ever see again for what it made me feel, but that I would certainly recommend to anyone. After all it is a film that will remain in my mind for the rest of my life, and I will never be able to take it our no matter how hard I'd try.",10,0,0,23 April 2001
The Ring," Sweet and pretty version of the Japanese shocker
","Well, being a big fan of the original, I didn't know what to think about an American remake being made. I thought all the usual stuff you might think when a remake of one of your favorite movies is made... 'It'll never be as good as the original' 'I'm sure they'll change tons of stuff to Americanize it' etc, etc. Well now that I've finally seen it, the answer is yes and no.Yes, now we have a prettier version of the film and the story. For one thing, we have gorgeous Australian beauty Naomi Watts and her incredible big blue eyes, and even Samara (American version of Sadaku) is a little pretty little girl who can either charm you or kill you. But that is understandable, is America for Christ sake, you have to make everything pretty. For the most, the photography and the editing were just a little above average. And the horror scenes if not utterly excessive were faithful remakes of the originals. At the end, it reinforced the opinion the original gave me of television.For those who might not know by now, the story centers around a journalist who is investigating certain videotape that kills whoever sees it within a period of 7 days. So, she has only a week to find how to solve the mystery before she also dies under the curse of the video. Vengeance, despair, and children misunderstanding form part of what might as well become a new cult hit or one heck of a good contender for the golden raspberry.
Now, the bad parts ***possible spoilers***. This is easy, since it is always more feasible to trash a movie than raise what is good about it. It is known that when a remake of anything is made, part of the deal is to change what you might consider not necessary or add something to improve the so called narrative. In this case, they tried to make the plot 'fool proof'; I can't stand that even for the slightest little detail there has to be a sometimes stupid explanation or flashback and never leaving anything to the imagination, which sometimes is more frightening than actual visual aids (remember the Blair Witch?), and that is one of the beauties of the original, the mixture of suggestion versus visualization. And for the plot itself, the changes they made of the origins of Samara's evil were not convincing at all, I liked it better when Sadaku was more like a vengeance for what her mother suffered, over here is just a bad spawn.Overall I liked it, when the final climax came, my heart beat increased, and when I least expected it, I was at the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen, and that shows how well it works.",8,0,0,2 November 2002
Fight Club," A near life experience
","You enter into this film...and what do you see? 'Your power animal'. Mischief, Mayhem, Soap, is not just a slogan, it's not just a part of a fad philosophy, it is a complete different way of life. This film is not for the weak-minded, or for those who live their lives deep inside their happy commercial, consumer life; but for those who are ready for the change. It is a message for all of us saying 'I understand you'. Acknowledge you are alive by self-destruction rather than rot yourself between shallow stuff that will only bring you temporary joy. By seeing this film, at the end you will be scarred with lye, your eyes opened wide and reborn as someone different, someone else.In his previous films, we could see how David Fincher sets us through the mind of the mad men, the murky world of John Doe, the memories of Victor Van Orton. But now, it is something completely different, we can see how the brain of the narrator works and how the brain cells act as a gun is stuck inside his mouth. This is only the beginning.Watching this film was really a 'Near life Experience', I felt how the world of Tyler Durden invaded me and I became not only a voyeur watching how Fight Club worked, but also a member of Fight Club itself. All the anger, the frustration and the loneliness were washed away by a new Nihilist philosophy that is hard to break. And after all this is Marla Singer, the symbol of the unexpected, a person who is free in much ways the rest of us are not, because she's not afraid to die. Some of us would like to be like that, but we are afraid.I was afraid of writing about this film and not being able to really tell what I really feel about it, but after all...What should I care for what any of you would have to say! 'You have to give up' There it is, I said it.",10,0,1,23 April 2001
Memento," The exquisiteness of film
","This is a film that is difficult to review as it is to see it, since anything you might say could spoil part of it. But believe me, no matter how much you try to imagine what you are about to see before you see it, you´ll never ger near by far. I had read many reviews, magazines, sites and still, so I thought I was prepared to see this film with no problem, but I was wrong, this film shocked me until the end of my spine.A film so unique that is able to create a new genre on its own, but I still don´t know how to name it, maybe I lack the imagination for it, but that is what the film is flooded by. This film is not only an achievement in story telling but also in atmosphere, mood and pace; it never lets go. It is engaging from beginning to end, one blink and you lose part of it; but believe me also in this, you won´t be able to blink once you set eyes on it, and on the extreme you might even forget you were breathing while watching it.In difference to other films I´ve seen throughout my entire life, this film got me in a way I can´t even mention. I still am figuring in my mind one way to solve Leonard´s problem, asking myself and getting in order what I just saw. It is certainly a film that is not possible to see just once and forget about it. I can´t wait to see it again; to witness and hope Leonard would find a way to solve the case.It also leaves you wondering, if Leonard´s 'condition' was either a bless or a curse. Imagine what would it be like to commit acts you won´t remember you did, what would it be like to have no record of time, and be able lo live the same thing over and over without feeling how time eats you as you get older; also what would it be like to nurture a feeling you have inside for the rest of your life and nothing else really matters. You´ll feel that way once you see Memento.It is certainly not an easy movie to see, it makes you part of the environment, you will have to set your brain in motion in order to comprehend what is going on, but I assure you, you won´t be the same person as you were before you see it.",10,0,1,9 June 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Welcome back to the unique world of Tim Burton
","Reviewing a film by Tim Burton is almost like describing the most fascinating incident in your life, you never know where to start. To begin with, what hasn't been said about this complete 'auteur' that I could probably say now, almost nothing. Since the beginning we can see that the places portrayed by Burton are not the real cities, but how he sees these places. New York is colorless and boring, and yet crude. But the town of Sleepy Hollow is something else, is mysterious, is dark, mistyful, and yet with certain cosyness; Sleepy Hollow is a place far different from the rest of the world that makes us feel like we are in another very weird dimension that reminds us his previous films.Again Burton uses the elements that have made his previous work famous, such as horror, the fight of one man against the whole world just because he is different, the animated cartoon-like effects, the wind mill that in a way represents his mind put on screen as a physical part of the environment through which the characters confront the nemesis, and a certain touch of elegant humour that could be even cataloged as dark. It is just impossible to see this films without thinking 'this is totally a Tim Burton film', and again he wouldn't be complete without a score by Danny Elfman whose best scores have been the ones he's made for Burton's films. All in all, I don't see a reason not to like this one, and as for me, it has already become one of those films I will never get tired of watching it.",9,0,0,4 April 2001
Blade II," Action gets an upgrade
","Most of the films that come out each year belong to certain genre, whether drama, horror, action, etc. But once in a while, there are films that not only belong to a genre but redefine it, films that change your vision to this certain genre. The kind of films that make you think 'Just when we thought we had seen it all...this comes out'. And this year that film has a name... Blade II.Since it is a sequel, it is obvious if not logical to compare it to its predecessor, but no matter how much you might like the first one, or how much you hate sequels, this is far superior than the other one. The mood is incredible, the action top notch, the music adequate, the visuals stunning. And what I love the most, scenes in which I went 'How the heck did they do that?!!!!'. By the end of the film I had to wait for the lights to come to find my jaw because I dropped it sometime during the movie.
Of course it has its flaws, but the film is so hyperactive that you don't have time to think about then while the movie is on. I mean, why is it that the bad guys are so dumb and many and the good guys agile and few? huh? But then again... This is part of a folklore you have to follow like the slowiness of the zombies or the shredded pants on werewolves, right? So it is not a problem here either. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD and see it over and over again during my insomnia nights at 3:00 am.I read Wesley Snipes suffered a lot during the shooting, I guess you have to pay with your own blood for something to be alright. And what can I say about Guillermo del Toro that hasn't been said before without sounding like a ridiculous butt kisser or a pretentious liar. Just this 'Good job'. Ohh, and this is for all those stupid so called 'action' directors that have let us down lately with lame excuses of film like rollerball or collateral damage...SHUT UP, LISTEN, SEE THIS AND LEARN. Or better yet, give space for the new generation to flourish.",9,0,1,2 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," How wonderful life is...
","...Now that Mouline Rouge is in the world. First of all, I'd like to apologize to Baz Luhrmann the director, to Nicole Kidman and to Ewan MacGregor, because no matter how hard I'd try to express how wonderful this film is and all the things it made feel, it won't be enough. This film is a total experience of life. I still have in my head all the color, the music, the wonder, the sadness, but most of all...I still feel the love. Mouline Rouge is fierce, is catastrophic, but also magnificent and exhilarating. In every single frame you will find the lust, grandeur and love of the time, but those sensations are as timeless as humanity and so is music, and this is what we experience here. You will doubt your senses, you won't believe your eyes, nor your ears. It will make your skin crawl in every single scene, and when you least expect it, your mouth will be opened wide, your eyes won't be able to blink and your ears will be fed with the most beautiful feast of music you'll ever find in a movie (except Dancer in the Dark). A love story told in a very unique way, like no other in the whole world. The dreamer who believed in love not withstanding he never felt it before; the delicate but beautiful courtesan who moved and felt like real Satin; the evil Duke (Maharajah) who would do everything he could to get the girl; and after all, the place that made all that possible...The Mouline Rouge, a place for dreams, lust, glamour, music, love, and LIFE. A fascinating place, colorful and hyperactive in which a visit was like a taste of Absinthe, well, the whole film is.Now, I'd also like to thank Baz Luhrmann, for bringing this visual feast to life, for giving us a piece of art that reminds us once again what is what we really love from cinema, and a film that will remain in my head forever. To Nicole Kidman for being such an extraordinary person, who like Satin, awakens all my senses just by looking at her. And finally Ewan MacGregor, who is an actor who's always surprising me in everything he does, I don't remember anything I didn't like from him. Overall, a film that is here to stay, so cry, weep, sing, love, and live it....Go visit the Mouline Rouge.Ahhh, after you see this film, you will hate Tom Cruise (even more) for leaving such a person like Nicole.",10,0,1,2 June 2001
The Mummy Returns," Just one summer movie
","Abuse of CGI effects? yes; More action than in the first one? yes; Do you need to have the brain of Einstein to understand it? No!; Is it sophisticated and will it prevail for the rest of the eternity? No; but...is it still worth watching? Completely!; Is it a fun movie that complies with what people expect from summer movies? Absolutely!!!.Spiderman-like mummies, pigmey mummies, two bad guys instead of one, 100 more special effects, twice the action including more than 100,000 bullets shot, a huge army of Anubises and the images that supposedly represent Egypt 3,000 years ago all golden and rich; what else would you like? Maybe a little more originality, but this is Hollywood and that is not possible most of the times. Is there anything wrong of using your eyes instead of your brains for having fun? I hope not, because I don't do that on summer adventure/action movies. Instead, try to take the movie for what it is, a continuation of the money making movie from 1999 to make even more money this time giving people a little more of the same thing the other did. Having that in mind, don't expect Oscar material in this movie, but just two hours of adventure, romance, an Indiana Jones-like score and money spent in its making, etc. And then, I assure you that you might have a pleasant time and a smile at the end of the film.",7,0,0,7 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," A good feast for intelligent minds...
","I can´t believe that all of you are talking about the same movie, are you sure you all saw the matrix reloaded with Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne? and the great great Hugo Weaving of course. Are you sure you understood the message here, or are you really part of the 99% who just think you can chose?I have been thinking, since I already have seen the movie three times now...What might it be that make all the mob to hate it? I finally came with an answer...all of them are part of a lesser mind, the kind needed to be controlled by a system, the same they need to be happy with such pieces of trash like X-men2. The main reason most people don´t like this excellent mind-bending, actions packed, adrenaline filled roller coaster is because...they do not understand it. And rather than accept it is far out of their league to get it, they chose to repel it. Shame on all of you.More than a review, this sounds like a manifesto against all the bad rep this movie is getting. But I believe it is a movie worth watching. It has nothing to do with hype and high expectations, it has more to do in how people do not fulfill the expectation of the movie towards them, but fear not...In time, this one will become the biggest cult sequel ever. Well, hoping minds are not lesser than these days.The so called 'poor plot' is excellent, with an extreme finesse that it really becomes fragile and strong at the same time. The action sequences are top notch, and anyone complaining about the 'fake and obvious CGI'...let me tell you...Unless you are able to find, not just people who look alike..but people looking exactly the same as Hugo Weaving, train them to jump in the sky and make it look real, go ahead, be my guest, otherwise just zip it. The car chase scene became instantly in one of my all time favorite action scenes ever!!!All in all, an excellent movie that really deserves a better rep than it has, but don´t worry we are living now in the sixth version, maybe the next one will be filled with more people who like to think once in a while...to all of you, just rest, lay down, and go on with your life enjoying 'really' empty stuff like your so beloved X-men2. Au revoir",10,0,0,31 May 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," simply, the best
","Spoiler Alert A few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank Redemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the 'institutionalized' Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the 'bad' element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be seen by everyone.",9,0,0,8 September 2001
Shrek," A total cliche-breaker
","At the beginning of the film, what do we see?...a big thick colorful fairy tale book that opens and the first thing you see is one those big weird letters that no one these days use, then a cartoon-like narrator begins telling the story of the lovely beautiful enchanted princess waiting for her prince charming to save her from evil; and after that...what might you be thinking?!! Oh no, this wasn't supposed to be Disney!!!, right? well it is not!!!!, the corny little book sooner becomes into something we all use at the restroom, and suddenly, the cliche is broken.Now, don't get me wrong, just because the story doesn't follow the same path all the fairy tales we are used to do, it means that this film has no charm or marvelous fantasy by itself; it is flooded by it. And on the other hand, it was a blast, I couldn't stop laughing every single minute, I don't remember laughing that much a long time a go. The slight touch of dark humor made the film devilishly funny and on the opposite, some of the gags were so naively funny it was impossible not to smile at least. The characters were so well developed that you could sympathize with them all the time. 
I hope Shrek would become a classic in the following years, although these times that seems to be something hard to achieve, even though this film has everything, from adventure, romance, comedy, a great cast behind the voices, a good score and it was released in summer, when everybody has the chance to see it even if it is by chance. Go see it, laugh, smile and have a good time.",9,0,0,30 May 2001
Signs," Raises a fair question...do you believe in it or not?
","Ok, lets see, I had the privilege of seeing this movie a few days ago. It was a strange experience, full of suspense, intrigue and smart dialogue (the kind of dialogue that makes you think or laugh sometimes), but I think the film has been misunderstood. The misunderstanding of the concept of the film is not the director's fault, not even the plot, it is merely a wrong interpretation from the advertising of the film. In a way it works, since the ads never prepare you for what you are going to see, which is good and surprising, but for a reason this is not sufficient for some people who are stuck in the idea of just seeing what the ads presented.
Once you see it, you will know that signs were not those huge things no one could explain, but other things more complicated that require your faith in a good director like Shyamalan to fall for it. Somewhere in the movie there's a scene in which the character played by Joaquim Phoenix asks Mel Gibson's character what he believes and Gibson says that there are always two different kinds of people, the believers and the skeptics. Taking those words, it is true, I found people hating this film and some other loving it, two groups, one believing and the others not. I take a stand on the first group, since I haven't found much movies this year that raises so many questions and makes you think more than once of what you just saw.",10,0,2,9 August 2002
Amélie," Once upon a time there was a marvellous piece of cinema...
","...That made happy almost all the people who saw it. It was a very uncommon work of art that gathered together all the elements required for being an  exceptional visual feast that fed all the minds that were enlightened by it. Set in a very weird/fantastic environment, it was impossible not to be absorbed into it like a whirpool messing with all your senses. That film is called 'the fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain' or if you like just 'Amelie'. And behind these unique fantasy view of France, there is the man, the director who took for himself the hedonistic role to make happy most of the people who would see the movie...Jean Pierre Jeunet. The murky, mysterious man who brought us the Post-Apocalypse in his previous work, now brings redemption in a world that is as strange as the others he's created. Amelie, is the story about a unique girl who suddenly realizes that her mission in life is to bring joy to others, but at the end is incapable to help herself when it comes to her happiness. This film, is the kind of fairy tale these days are lacking; like a couple of Aspirins that relieve you from the pain the outside world brings you for 2 hours. Now, the fact that the film is a fantasy and that Amelie might be the sweetest thing you would ever see, doesn't mean that she's capable of being mean with the people that messes with her. Just look at the poster for the movie, we see a girl that is happy just by enjoying the small delights of life, but that will get back at you if it is necessary. At the end, a person just like any of us in a world just like ours, only sought with different eyes and color...green. It is implied that this film has become one of my all time favorites ever. After watching it once, it becomes like a drug, something you have to do more than once. I became an Amelie-addict and I don't think I will ever rest until I see it again. That good is.",10,1,3,16 January 2002
