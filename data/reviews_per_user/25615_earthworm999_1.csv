Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Just say no
","If there were ever a movie which deserved a negative rating, this is the one. It just wasn't funny. Not even close. No laughs. Nothing. It should have bypassed the theaters, bypassed video and gone straight to the trash bin. It makes Ed Wood look like John Ford. The message of this film is that the viewer was duped into wasting their money on this piece of film garbage. The film is shocking in it's stupidity. It makes Jackass look like an Oscar winner. I'm still in awe that anyone cared. Don't waste your time, don't wast your money, don't waste your life. Run the other way just a fast as you can and don't look back. Just say NO to this film.",1,5,10,5 November 2007
