Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Greatest Movie of All Time
","This is everything I could want from a movie. It has excellent drama, visuals, character development, dialogue, story, humor, suspense... The list could go on and on forever. The profundity of the movie is  incredibly powerful. The epic story sweeps you along to the greatness and deepness of human imagination. Its philosophical wisdom is unherd-of in modern history. The atmosphere of this movie is at the same time intensely serious and truly funny. The young love story between Anakin and Padme is believably beautiful. Jar-Jar works as an absurd comic relief, carrying the tale to new skies of realism.Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is in my opinion the best movie ever made.",10,22,37,28 September 2001
