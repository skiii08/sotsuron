United 93," We Need To Remember
","This movie was well shot and directed.It was powerful,honest and something all Amaericans (and all of the world) needs to see to remind them of what we are up against in fighting the radical Islamic fascists.The movie really shows what terrorism is and what it will do to accomplish it's goals. The movie also shows we can and should fight back against this insidious evil band.The movie shows ordinary people, going about their lives before these pieces of garbage ended it and destroyed so many lives in the process. This movie makes it very clear who our enemy is, what they will do and we need to remember it and do everything to eliminate it from the face of this earth.Too many have fallen asleep again and this movie should awaken them.",10,1,4,6 May 2006
