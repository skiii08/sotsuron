The Avengers," The Avengers Assembled and truly amazed me!
","The Avengers is a Sci-Fi/Superhero movie with a lot of amazing moments in the history of FILM! This movie was long awaited, and it was DEFINITELY worth the wait...The Avengers truly had a crack at being a number 1 movie, and it's attempt worked. It has really good action scenes, with a few laughs along the way. The movie really had to work hard with the character development, and the end result was PERFECT! Scarlet Johansson was GREAT as Black Widow, but Black Widow really needs her own movie to start her off fresh, this was a bad opening for her. Hawkeye (who was introduced also) was fabulous. I wasn't happy with Captain America: The First Avenger, because the movie was DREADFUL, but Captain America really got the spotlight he deserved. The script was AMAZING as was the Sci-Fi plot which was truly INTELLIGENT. Even if you don't like the movie, you will have fun anyway. 10/10, a great movie, even with high standards.",10,5,11,2 June 2012
Men in Black 3," MIB3, Alien Sci-Fi or an Action?
","The movie is good, but I couldn't decide, is it a MIB film? Obviously it is, but it didn't have that many aliens that we had in the MIB series so far. The movie did great as an action film, but not so great as a Sci- Fi. The comedy was done perfectly, except I would have liked them to cut down on the jokes for my action scenes, some scenes where left a banded. The movie has an amazing ending, but has a really slow middle. I really liked the movie because it just had wonderful CGI, when you could get it. The 3D was OK, but instead of having it in 3D, they needed to spend more money on the scenery in the 60's part of the film, it looked like we where in 2009.The movie was great and very funny, but sometimes overloaded, and paced. The movie goes for 106mins, but I would rather have the movie go for 130mins and have some great action scenes, some more comedy, some more 3D scenes and some more Aliens. I have a feeling the movie was low budgeted.I will give the movie this though, it was fun, funny and SOMETIMES entertaining. It did have good action scenes, when you could get them (which was very rarely), some AWESOME CGI (which I felt like we missed out on), and a really great ending (Very heartfelt). But really this movie shouldn't be called a MIB movie. Sorry, it was still good though.",6,1,4,2 June 2012
Ted," Do your self a favour!
","Ted is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, by far one of the best comedies (21 Jump Street and Ted) and one of the most creative aspects I have seen in nearly two whole years!Cast: Seth MacFarlane voices Teddy/Ted perfectly, Mila Kunis as Lori is magnificent and Mark Whalberg as John was perfect also.Script: All the script was great, but Mila Kunis' Lori character didn't have a strong script, so that was a let down.Plot: Plot was hilarious and highly interesting. The plot was the best thing about the movie because I thought there wasn't going to be one, but it was hidden in the shadows.Direction: Seth MacFarlane directs perfectly, and thank god for that! Because I thought it would have been all over the place!Overall: Ted is a delight and extremely funny, do yourself a favour!",9,1,6,4 August 2012
Rise of the Guardians," The Guardians don't Rise
","Rise of the Guardians is the newest film from DreamWork's Animation. Let me get started, Rise of the Guardians has the best voice talents... Forget Brave, Madagascar 3 or even ParaNorman. The voice talents just fit perfectly with the characters. The script is so bad. The plot is too simple and eventually has nothing to do (for its 100 minute runtime), It just isn't good enough. The script seemed like it was written by a bunch of 4 years olds, it just wasn't good... At all... I only laughed about twice.The animation is eye candy. It looked superb, but, Brave had the best animation.Overall, Rise of the Guardians is strictly for kids... Adults may get bored... 2/5 stars.",4,8,21,17 December 2012
Fast & Furious 6," Going Fast made me Furious
","Fast and Furious 6 is the sixth installment in the popular, Fast & Furious franchise. I think Fast 5 is absolutely awesome, but this is just so... DULL. This film has been done before and better. Fast and Furious 6 is just so dumb. It has good cinematography and placement of the camera, but not much else. It definitely chooses style over substance, and that got annoying when you heard this characters speaking every major plot point... BOOOO!This film is just so uninteresting, but it does have some promising visual effects.4 out of 10.",4,2,5,25 June 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Write a interesting script, put in only few action scenes, and hey, we got a Bourne sequel/reboot!
","Not having watched the Bourne franchise, I thought this would be awesome! Yeah, it was good. The first trailer for this movie looked so crappy, but when the second trailer came out, I started to get excited.The script/Character Development: The characters were so interesting, that when you needed to get emotional you got emotional. Even though the dialogue was overloaded, way overloaded, I found myself starting to lag off this movie a little more. Don't get me wrong, it was written to perfection, but it was really overloading. Rachel Weisz character was probably the most fantastic female character in a film this year (except for Meridah in Brave, her terrific hair :P). She introduced her character very well. Some characters didn't need to be there, when you see the movie, you will notice it as well.Acting: The acting was superb, Rachel Weisz was most enjoyable on screen. She had something that Jeremy Renner couldn't bring to the screen, and that made the acting of the movie complete. Direction: Some scenes were sometimes scattered, but they picked up in the end.More problems: NO CLIMAX! This movie had no solution what so ever which, in my opinion, makes the movie not needed and not really enjoyable material, especially if you pay $12-$13 for a movie ticket. With no climax, the movie really has no ending, and that is very shameful. I even stayed for the credits to see if something would pick up.Overall: The movie was good, not perfect. I do actually hope for a sequel, and I hope we get a climax next time round! Thank you. Search up 'Joseph Akers' in the YouTube search box for some reviews!",6,7,11,19 August 2012
Hotel Transylvania," Some jokes are forced, but an overall enjoyable film!
","Hotel Transylvania stars: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James and David Spade. It goes for approximately 90 minutes. It fails to deliver GREAT 3D moments although some could be classified as 'GOOD'. The first half of the movie is what is called 'Jokes Are Failing' Syndrome. Although they do crack in a couple of good laughs in the first half, majority don't live up to expectations that animations nowadays do. Too many slapstick moments and unnecessary forced jokes... NOTE TO FILM-MAKERS: If jokes are forced... Don't even bother with the joke!The movie has heart though, which kind of makes for it's first half. The second half however is fun, cool, funny and surprisingly a bit thrilling! It does have it's fun moments... I will admit. Although some of the 3D doesn't work I still found it to be a good animation... Is it the best animation of the year? NO WAY! But is it great as an animation? No, not really it is what I call 'A good animation if you just let your mind do nothing!' A B from me.",7,9,12,3 November 2012
Dark Shadows," Awesome, it is highly entertaining
","Dark Shadows is a movie based on a TV show, that I specifically don't know. I walked into this movie VERY hyped up, I knew that it was a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie, and it was going to be great, and it was. It had lots of cool CGI, lots of cool action scenes to keep EVERYBODY entertained. It has laugh out loud comedy, which was good every know and then. Johnny Depp was TRULY amazing, he was more in character than he is with Captain Jack Sparrow, truly!The plot was very interesting and entertaining. It has an all star cast including: Michelle Pfieffer, Eva Green, Chloe Grace Moretz, Tommy Lee Miller and with the comical genius Helena Bonham Carter, and to top it off a cameo by Alice Cooper. The music was composed by Danny Elfman (Edward Sciccorhands), whom has had worked with Tim Burton before.The movie was amazing and truly spectacular, 10/10. Great Job!",10,2,6,2 June 2012
Prometheus," Some great fun in 3D
","This movie was AWESOME. It had awesome CGI, some great graphics and some mind blowing 3D. The movie was at times VERY scary. But please see this movie, I will tell you in my review why you should...The movie was highly entertaining and kept you looking, even in the gruesome and disgusting parts. The movie, as I mentioned before, had awesome CGI and a great storyline. The 3D was made perfectly. The script was magnificent, as was the acting. This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, a director that can do a good movie and a bad movie, but this time he pulled it off. The acting was MAGNIFICENT, it was truly special. Even though I wouldn't see the sequel, if they made one, I will still give this movie 10 stars, for being highly imaginative and really entertaining.",10,13,27,10 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises, yeah, he rises, got a problem with that? I sure don't!
","AWESOME!! BRAVO!! GO SEE THE DARK KNIGHT RISES!!The acting: The acting was beyond amazing, especially Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, who actually was the star of the movie! Christian Bale was great, Michael Caine was awesome also, but Anne Hathaway just really shines. Also GREAT Morgan Freeman, especially with his little role.The direction: I think it is safe to say that Christopher Nolan has done it again! Christopher Nolan is the director of our generation and he is just an amazing story teller.The plot: The doomsday plot was actually better than I thought it would be. I thought it wouldn't work at all, but it worked fantastically!The script: The script it just pure AWESOMENESS!Action scenes: Action scenes truly made the movie complete. But sometimes even the dialogue was better, not saying that the action scenes were weak, it is just that the dialogue was really interesting.Bane: Bane isn't a last movie villain, but I still had fun with him during the movie, because he was just so well developed and we got a great twist from him.Overall: Go see TDKR NOW!!",10,5,11,4 August 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," OK but not I'm not Wowed!
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II needed more improvement. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a great book but the movie is so horrible but it is good at the same time!Harry Potter is a great franchise there are some movies that are horrible and boring like this one and the Half-Blooded Prince.Even though I didn't enjoy Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was wowed in some parts it was great but not so great at the same time. It is stuck in the middle.I do recommend you go and see it since it is the last movie but don't blame me if you are upset by wasting your money, Thank you!",3,3,4,13 August 2011
