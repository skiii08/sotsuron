Vertigo," weak characters (spoilers ahead)
","OK, I know this is a masterpiece and everything, and I agree that ithad great photography and special effects (the zooming in andout), but the story itself was pretty dumb.  More specifically, Scottywas a really dumb detective, and he should have retired 20 yearsbefore the beginning of the movie. His obsession with Madelineand his need to reconstruct Judy (only to find out that thereconstruction was originally a reconstruction anyway) are totallyunfitting and he just comes across as an aging pervert.  There's alack of consistency throughout the movie, no matter how much onechooses to suspend one's disbelief.  Not impressive.",7,2,7,4 July 2003
The Killing Fields," lacks unity
","I see that most reviews describe this movie as amazing, etc. but I was actually pretty disappointed by it.  For one, it was too long.  My other criticism is that it lacks unity, somewhat like Full Metal Jacket but even more so.  It touched on many important and interesting topics (the friendship and quest for Pran, the 'year zero' program, the hypocrisy of war, the hardships of journalism, etc. , the list is long) but  ended up skimming the surface of each. As a result, this movie is under-developed. It could have been made into more than one movie; Pran's experience in the labor camp, for example, could / should have been made into a movie of its own.On the other hand, 'The Killing Fields' should be given credit for coming before all the great war movies we all refer to now (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket...) and most likely influencing them.  It should also be given credit because so few movies actually refer to Cambodia.  Everyone is so interested in Vietnam and WWII that Cambodia is very often left behind. The acting was great (although I'm not sure about the Oscar... opposite John Malkovich? No-one should win opposite John Malkovich!) but the music got on my nerves for the most part.Overall, the fact that the movie was so chopped up and that it went everywhere (and that it was long) didn't really do it for me. I just waited for it to end, but I suppose I'm glad I watched it.",Null,1,5,14 June 2004
The Pianist," Aesthetic but stereotypical (and long)
","I saw this movie on the plane during a transatlantic flightyesterday.  While I agree that watching movies on a planediminishes their value, I don't think this is applicable to ThePianist.  Technically I found it very well made (photography, music,colors, etc.) but I have to say that the story itself contains everysingle stereotype available to survival stories (not only WWIIcamps).  That was actually pretty disappointing because I hadheard so many good things about it.  Brody was good but his wasnot an Oscar performance.",Null,0,2,26 August 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," not sure...
","*some spoilers*I'm not sure what to make of this movie.  It reminded me way too much of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, where Angelina Jolie basically takes on Jack Nicholson's role.  So that did not really impress me (I think very highly of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and this was very pale in comparison). On the other hand, I really don't think she deserved an Oscar for her performance.  It seems though that nowadays in order to get an Oscar, women have to either play roles if hysterical women (Halle Berry), bullies (Catherine Zeta-Jones), or a combination of both (Angelina Jolie).  I don't think any of these performances were worthy of an Oscar.  I don't necessarily think that Winona Ryder should have gotten it either for this movie, but I do think that her role was somewhat harder to play than Jolie's, whose character was moreover quite inconsistent, especially at the end when she basically melts away like the Wicked Witch of the West.  I thought that was out of place and unimpressive.I really liked the effects at the beginning of the movie, when Susanna goes from the past back into the present. The editing of these scenes was pretty impressive.  It usually was prompted by someone's voice and Susanna looked away and found herself in the present. But that stopped after the first night check, and it turns out that these were just memories, not visions. Overall the acting was good, and so was the movie, but I was expecting more. More originality, better performance from Angelina Jolie, more feelings, etc.",Null,1,2,3 June 2004
Blow," very touching
","This movie's title should be something like 'The man who gotscrewed over by all his friends except one or two.'  I found Blow very touching and well-made. Touching because it isa real story, and because it is very personal.  As a child, George vows to have a lot of money because he's seenhis mother's reaction to his father's financial failures. Ironically heends up marrying someone whose reaction is just as bad in thesame situation.  Is he blaming his mother for everything?  I don'tthink so, but we can all relate to something similar.  This is verymuch a movie about family and relationships, more so than amovie about drugs.  It shows how far greed can take people andwhat it can turn them into.The acting was great.  Even Penelope Cruz and Ray Liotta aregreat.  The first five minutes though are hard because we have toget used to Johnny Depp's horrible Jon Bon Jovi hairdo.  Later wehave to shield our eyes from some of his clothes, but I guess allthat comes with the territory of being a millionaire in the 70's.",9,0,1,21 July 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Muse, what have they done?
","I read on the trivia page that the Coen brothers hadn't read TheOdyssey before working on O Brother Where Are Thou, and I reallybelieve that.  If they had, this could have been a really smart movie.As it is, it vaguely refers to parts of The Odyssey, without muchthought being put.  The few scenes that are inspired by TheOdyssey are clustered together and late in appearing. I got theSirens' part, but why mix that with Circe?  Why does the KKKmeeting represent Hades (Hades in not hell and is not limited to'bad' people)?  What the heck is Cyclops doing there anyway?These elements are too randomly included for the movie to 'bebased' on The Odyssey.One huge difference between O Brother and The Odyssey is thecharacter of Odysseus -he wasn't a thief, he was a king!  Hetraveled 10 years to reach his home and lost all his men on theway.  His outer beauty reflected his nobility and wit.  In a word, hewas perfect.  Although Clooney's character is a smartass, he's notexactly smart.  Penelope is of course the other great character inThe Odyssey, where she patiently waits for Odysseus's return,who , upon his return, kills all the suitors who abused thehospitality they were offered.  O Brother also forgets Telemachus,their son. If this movie intended to transpose scenes from The Odyssey ontothe rural American South, it could have done so in many differentways, but I guess reading Homer should have been the first step.Magic could have been out of it then.I failed to find this movie 'hilarious' but I did find the photographybeautiful, as well as the incorporation of music.  I am not veryfamiliar with the Coen's films -I only saw Fargo and that was 2weeks ago- but they seems stuck on idiocy, and I have a hard timeappreciating that.  Another thing they seem to do is open with ageneral appeal. In O Brother the opening lines of The Odysseyappear, and in Fargo we are told that the following story is true(which isn't because there's a disclaimer with the end credits).  I'mnot sure what the point of these openings is since they're bothdeceptive. Overall, this movie could have been full of genius with smarthumor and wonderful references, but I guess it falls short ofachieving that.  The end result is a little weak -or not as good as itought to be.",7,0,1,20 June 2003
