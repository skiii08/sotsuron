It," Creepy, Funny, and Perfect
","IT is the story of a group of children known as the loser's club that encounter an evil entity that has been feeding on the people of the town of Derry for a long time, so they unite and come together to hopefully kill IT.First of all the loser's club is fantastic. They feel like actual friends and their chemistry was just perfect. One person that stood out to me was Richie. He was really funny and he is kinda the smart ass of the group. I loved Bill too. You can just see why he wants to kill this thing not only for killing other kids, but for killing his brother. In the movie you can see the pain and grief he is experiencing and he is determined to avenge his death. Another thing i loved about this movie was IT/Pennywise (they are the same thing). He is just creepy in his design and he looks a little off, like his eyes are just tilted and not human. Pennywise looked like a true monster with how he sounded, how he moved, and it just felt like his true form was controlling him on the inside. With Pennywise it made the film more thrilling and it made you care for the Loser's club. Bill Skarsgard did an excellent job and i think this will be the new thing that terrifies children. So in the end i loved this movie. Its Intense, its Creepy, its Funny, and it actually has a lot of Heart in it. IT gave me everything i hoped for with a little bit more then i expected. This in my book is my favorite Stephen King Adaptation. A+ or 10/10 Along with Get Out this may be the best horror movie this year.",8,8,18,9 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Slow start, but builds to an epic 2nd and 3rd act.
","So rogue one, is the story of a band of heroes that must steal the plans for the death star if they ever hope to destroy it. First the pros. Let me start by saying this film is a great war film. Its dark, its gritty, and its depressing. As for special effects they are awesome(as usual in a star wars movie). Gareth Edwards has proved that he does an excellent job at making things huge. I saw the death star in this movie and remember saying 'dame that's huge'! The cast does a good job as well. And i saved the best for last, the action scenes. Oh my god, they are amazing. You got ground troops fighting each other, You got an astounding space battle, And you got rebels fighting huge at-ats. As for the cons this movie doesn't do to well in the begging. The film wants you to accept these new characters in a very rushed manner. I wouldent say the characters are disposable, more like not as memorable. So in the end Rogue one has a slow start with a few character problems, but it then builds to an epic 2nd and 3rd act that makes all of those flaws seem very forgettable. 9/10 *2nd favorite movie of 2016",9,1,2,15 January 2017
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," fun and funny
","So if you are aware with the hit TV-show 'south park' then i am sure you have seen this film, and if you have not then go see ASAP. Before i begin i must explain that this film is for adults and not for kids. I must say what a very funny film. It may not have the best jokes but you'll surely laugh. This film may not have the best animation, but however the animation is still very creative compared to well known animated films. The film also has a story that sounds stupid, but when it is used in a manner that is meant for comedy, then it works very well. It still is not as good as the series itself, but it does work as a fun and funny, animated, adult humored, summer blockbuster. So i think if you like the series, then i believe you will have fun with this film.",8,0,1,18 August 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A fun and unique Spider-Man movie
","Spider-Man: Homecoming focuses on the story of Peter Parker and how he has many responsibilities. He has to keep his grades up in school, he has to impress Tony Stark if he ever wants to become an avenger, he has to save the city from minor threats since he is spider-man, and he has to deal with a new threat 'The Vulture'. So i liked how this movie avoids the same story about Peter Parker's Uncle and avenging his death. We have seen this story go on for 5 movies now, and it was refreshing that they didn't even mention it. Tom Holland also does a good job at playing Peter Parker and Spider- Man, he really adds the comedy theme to spider-man's character. Michael Keaton also plays a very well done villain named the Vulture and he does a great job at it as well. It was really cool to see my personal favorite spider-man villain adapted onto the big screen. The action is cool and fun to look at. A NOTE FOR PEOPLE ABOUT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! its not a movie completely about our web slinging hero fighting bad guys, its more of a story about the the troubles and responsibilities a teen goes through. And those who have been to High School can relate to this movie like i found myself doing the same thing. So if you take your child to see this movie he/she might be a little bored because they just want to see spider-man fight and do things. Its not perfect and I'm gonna talk about the flaws i have found in this movie. The original spider-man movies made the action a bit more dramatic and realistic, while this movie just makes it seem like its more for fun then actual realism. I also felt like they could have done a better job with the soundtrack, some musical elements don't really match whats going on in the film. At times the movie can drag a bit but fortunately something funny or action packed happens to boost the movie and keep it on its feet. So overall, Spider-Man: Homecoming is a very fun and very unique experience. Is it the best spider-man movie? No, but it does standout from the rest as just being a fun and blockbuster popcorn movie. B+ or 8/10",8,5,35,30 July 2017
Dunkirk," Good (but not as good as people are making it out to be)
","Dunkirk is the true story about British, French, and Belgium soldiers that are trapped on the beach of Dunkirk waiting for rescue, while the German empire surrounds them. First off, this movie is beautifully filmed. The cinematography alone is worth seeing. The places they chose to film were great and fitted the movie perfectly. Even though there is hardly any Character development in this movie, everyone did a good job. The action was also a pretty awesome strength to the movie. The ship battles and the dogfights were great and very well filmed. Easily the best part of the movie (for me) was the soundtrack and the sounds. The soundtrack made the movie feel so tense and epic. And also the Guns, planes, bombs, and explosions sounded very realistic. It made you feel like you were actually there. So overall i enjoyed this movie for what it was; but that being said, it is very overrated and not the masterpiece everyone says it is.When i first heard that Christopher Nolan (the director of one of my favorite movies The Dark Knight) was directing this movie, i was so hyped and had huge expectations. But sadly not all of them were met. I wanted the movie to have some ground battles but they were mostly in the air or in the ocean. I wanted solid characters but the entire movie is dedicated to the battle. The movie does drag sometimes and its not always interesting. Before i saw this movie i saw an ocean of positive reviews, some saying that this is one of the best war movies ever made. But after seeing it myself, i was not agreeing. In the end, I did find myself enjoying Dunkirk but it is overrated. Its not 'The Best Movie Of The Year' nor 'The best War Movie Ever Created'. Its a solid and accurate movie on a real life event. I'm giving it a 7/10 or a solid B.",7,1,3,14 October 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A memorable prequel
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a prequel to 1968 film Planet of the Apes. In this movie we see the story of a new drug that is under testing and it is suppose to heal the minds of those with Alzheimer's, but once a loyal chimp named Caeser is exposed to it as a child he gains super intelligence and leads an uprising of apes. First of all the movie is very interesting, it really does fill in some of the plot holes of the 1968 original. It answers many of our questions like how this went down, who started it, who is to blame, etc. The CGI is also very impressive. The main character here is Caeser and he is amazing. He shows that you don't need dialogue to make a character interesting. The action scenes are very great and well filmed. If was was going to list a negative it would probably be that whenever the film cuts back to the human characters it is not as interesting as the apes. Whenever the film went to them i was saying 'Okay lets go back to the apes now.'So anyway in the end, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a very well made, very enjoyable, interesting, captivating, and it shows that a prequel is not always bad. A- or 9/10",9,0,0,27 June 2017
Get Out," A very intense and very original horror comedy
","Get Out focuses on a black man named Chris while he travels with his girlfriend to meet her very nice but very suspicious parents. After Chris is introduced to the house he sees some disturbing imagery and weird acts that make him think something more darker is present, but what exactly? First off, everybody in the movie is great. This film also offers some astounding visual horror. I didn't expect this to be a comedy, but when you get the comedy it really pays off. Get Out actually touches some of the social issues that are in our world such as racism and it does it in a very smart way. The soundtrack is also pretty great and works very well with what is going on in the movie. This isn't a flaw but there are some scenes that were scary but it didn't really make any sense, but fortunately the big twist explains why that weird thing happened. I won't spoil it, but the twist is very satisfying and is very unsettling to even think about. In the end, Get Out was a very intense but also in a sort of sense serious with things that happen in our community and excellently blends horror, comedy, and social commentary in one original and creative film. A+ or 10/10",10,10,19,15 June 2017
Hellboy," Blockbuster fun!
","This movie sounds stupid on the outside, but its actually pretty good. The reason i say this movie sounds stupid is because read the plot. The son of the devil is raised to fight dark and mythical monsters that are hell bent on taking over the world. First the pros. So the makeup and special effects they have on these characters are astounding. Hellboy's even looks cool. The plot is actually kinda simple, but its simple entertainment. Simple entertainment doesn't neccesairly make a good movie, but it makes a pretty entertaining one. By the way if you love action in movies, then you are gonna like this film because it is totally action packed. But now the cons. So some of the characters aren't really engaging. Some of the characters i didn't care for because they don't really have much to do. So overall i really enjoyed Hellboy. It was entertaining, eye popping, and action packed fun. In my opinion, i say it represents a good example of a summer blockbuster.",7,1,1,26 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," People are Overreacting Big Time
","Star War: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is the 8th episode in the new Star Wars saga and has a lot of fans divided over weather Disney ruined it or admire it for going into bold new directions. But i am gonna talk more about that later and just get on to what i loved and didn't like about the movie. First of all i love a majority of the people in this movie. Most of the new cast returns and they are all pretty good especially Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren in episode 7 was just good to me, he wasn't great or anything like that, but in this movie you can see he just wants to succeed and impress his master Snoke and he learns to grow as a person. Rey is also pretty good here too. But my favorite performance was Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. I love the direction they took with his character, just someone who wants to hide and not face what he possibly caused. The Special effects are good but that's expected at this point. Action scenes were well filmed and weren't disapointing in the slightest.In my opinion there was a lot to love about this film, but that doesn't mean it's a flawless movie. This has probably been said way to many times, but there is a plot line with Finn and a new character Rose. This plot is just about them going to a casino planet to find a code breaker but are then captured for jeez i don't know maybe 12 seconds before they break out and during the whole escape scene there's a lot of commentary about animal cruelty and how some people profit off of war. Not only does this feel completely rushed, but it doesn't fit anywhere in this movie. It's fine to have social commentary in a film (i often encourage it) but at least do it in a clever way and not make it so preachy. Also something that pissed people off was the death of Snoke. This to be completely honest didn't matter that much to me, but i wish he had some arch like how the Emperor did in Return of The Jedi. I also in some way liked this scene because Kylo Ren is free and is now the leader of The First Order. He has no one holding him back like how the Emperor did towards Vader.Overall i enjoyed this movie. but with that being said it is in no way a flawless movie, actually now that i think about it this movie could have been so much more. But i still liked it for what it was. But i also think that a lot of people are really overreacting. A lot of people are complaining about how this movie felt so different and how they changed the vision that J.J Abrams had for the saga. People calm down! It's a movie, it's fine if you didn't like it but damn do you have to protest about how bad it is and how it should be removed from the Star Wars cannon? People just expect way too much from Star Wars these days. I'll give it a 7/10, not perfect but overall an enjoyable Star Wars movie.",7,0,3,11 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," The best Marvel Movie
","After i saw the first trailer for the Guardians of the Galaxy, i couldn't help but think that it was just a rip off of the avengers. But i was very, very wrong. It focuses on a group of galactic criminals that accidentally join forces to stop a mad man and his goons destroying the galaxy. The characters were amazing. They all play their role excellently and deliver a handful of laughs. The action and set pieces are great to. The thing that kinda bothered me in avengers was that they saved all the action til the very end, but its all over the place in this movie. I thought that this movie was better than the Avengers. It just has better action, better character development, and better set pieces (not a better villain though). So overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy is an action packed ride which has great characters and earns the spot on my favorite Marvel movie of all time. A+ or 10/10. I am so excited for The Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2",10,2,4,2 April 2017
Jurassic World," A fun popcorn thriller!
","Jurassic world is the 4th installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. It's main plot is a new open park full with man made dinosaurs and one day the company decides to make a genetic hybrid to boost the public's attention. But that of course goes horribly wrong and soon enough the hybrid is on the loose and killing people left and right. While all of this is going on, a raptor trainer Owen and the park's owner Clair must stop this monster before a monster mash goes down. First the good. Chris Pratt plays a good role and he is easily the best human character. The action is very entertaining and very pleasing to the eye. The dinosaurs are very cool as always, and the hybrid was awesome. The suspense is one of the strongest things this movie has to offer. But now time for the bad. There are a few people you do not really care about, for example there are two kids in the movie that were completely hollow and didn't have any real purpose except for escaping the dinosaurs. And sometimes this movie can come off as silly when it tries to be cool. So in the end Jurassic World is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster that may not be as good as the original but has it memorable moments in the Jurassic Park universe. 7/10 Check it out.",7,1,3,11 March 2017
Logan," A flat out Masterpiece
","So i really had no intention to see this movie cause i didn't really think the X-men movies were all that great, but my roommate rented this and he asked if i wanted to watch it. So i thought i would give it a watch and oh my god, this movie is incredible. Logan is the story of an old and tired wolverine that is done with everything. He is sick and on the verge of dying because the thing that makes him wolverine is now poisoning him. He wants to go away and live a peaceful life with Professor X, but once he meets this girl that has a few people hunting her down, Logan and the Professor are thrown back into the midst and have to protect this girl as well as themselves. First the obvious, Hugh Jackman plays Logan and i honestly think he deserves an Oscar for his performance. He does a spectacular job at playing a man that is just wants to give up on everything. The action sequences are well done and greatly engaging. There is also a tragic and sad moral to this movie, about how we all get old and die. This is probably my favorite movie ever made. If i was going to point out one flaw in this movie its that the movie at times slows down, but fortunately that happens to give some character development and it makes the upcoming action much more satisfying. So in the end, Logan was a masterpiece and it truly floored me. Every character is engaging especially Logan and the little girl. The soundtrack, the action, and the story is just amazing and very well done. I could not be happier with this movie and i really mean it when i say it is my favorite movie of all time. A+ or 10/10",10,5,12,3 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," An exact copy of the classic original
","Ever since Disney made a live action remake of the jungle book, they have been making remakes of our childhood films,and hope to continue doing that. And then you have this movie. We all know the story, A beautiful girl stumbles across a castle with talking house hold items and a beast, but soon enough they grow to love each other. I really liked all the people in this movie, they did a good job at playing their roles, whether they were a mild mannered tea cup, or a hairy creature. The special effects were good, and most of the musical numbers were great. However all the people and the music does not make up for the same exact story as the animated classic. I enjoyed The Jungle Book and Pete's Dragon because all though they had some of the same elements, they boosted enough new elements and a new plot to keep the story going. While this movie doesn't do that at all. I expected some things do be different but it gave me the same characters, same plot, and mostly the same musical numbers. Hell they even had the same dialogue. So in the end, Beauty and the Beast may have some enjoyable moments, but that is not enough to keep us engaged when all it is an exact copy of the classic original. C- or 5/10. Face it the only reason they made this film was to put more money into Disney's pockets.",6,9,19,19 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Funny and Action Packed!
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th in the Marvel Universe (i wonder how the studio hasn't ran out of ideas). This film focuses on the guardians and how they must fight off the gold people after stealing something of theirs, while Star Lord discovers his father and discovers the truth about him. That is one of the things i loved about this movie, so many things are going on and it is not distracting at all. It still manages to stay fresh and funny. The actors are still pretty good and some have improved over the last movie like Drax and Yondu. I also thought Ego(star lord's father) was a fantastic character. The dialogue is funny and very creative. As always the CGI is very good and the movie just looked beautiful. As far as action goes, i thought this was a great improvement. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the best movie i have seen all year so far, as it improves with the characters, plot, action sequences, and comedy. A+ or 10/10. AHHH MY NIPPLES!-Drax",10,53,97,8 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Not perfect, but a good example of a monster movie.
","Kong skull island is a movie about a group of people who discover an uncharted island and find a very mad gorilla known as King Kong, while also battling many more unholy creatures. So i really liked Kong in this movie, he was just a very strong, and gentle giant. The special effects in the movie were astounding. There are a few amazing scenes like when we first see Kong, And when he battles the octopus and the skull crawlers. The acting is good even though people themselves aren't. Some people were worried about how John C. Reilly's comedy and jokes were not going to work that well in this particular film, as for me i thought some of his jokes were funny, while others came off as stupid or not really that funny. The plot is very silly and not that well made. And my main grip with this movie is how you don't really care about anybody. So even though i found some flaws with this movie, i still enjoyed it. It's not nearly as good as the original, but i thought it was better then the 2005 version. So in the end it may have some flaws, but it is still a fun popcorn movie which sets a good example about what a true monster movie is. B+ or 8/10. Oh and by the way the end credits scene was amazing, the scientist says how there are many islands out there and he shows James Conrad some pictures about Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, And King Ghidorha, And it ends with a Godzilla roar. So be expecting these guys in a lot more movies!",8,1,3,11 March 2017
Mother!," Meh.....not bad
","Mother! is the story of a couple that settle down in the middle of know where (so they think) and soon enough weird things start happening when strangers begin to let themselves in their own house. First off, this movie is hella weird, but its a good weird. Its weird in a way that is unsettling and crazy at the same time. I liked the characters and their performances were on spot. But......with that being said i was a little disappointed with this film. When i first saw the trailer for Mother! i expected a thrilling and intense mystery that would leave a horrifying taste in my mouth, but its not a horror movie at all. Its a metaphorical movie that has some religious themes about how we treat our earth and how Mother Nature would feel about it. It irritated me that nothing is really explained. So in the end this movie is a watch once and forget about it for me, but overall i would call it a somewhat enjoyable film. For me it was just a big Unsettling, confusing, crazy, unexplained mess. C+ or 6/10 Some people love this movie and some people hate it, but i fall in the middle section of that argument.",6,0,1,23 October 2017
Life," An enjoyable science fiction horror movie.
","Life is a science fiction horror film that focuses on a group of people aboard a space shuttle that discover a life form that seems very harmless and friendly until it starts to survive which includes killing everyone. Know i was really engaged with the movie. I cant think of one moment when my eyes weren't off the screen. The alien is amazing and very smart. And how it kills people is very horrifying and also morbidly creative. And it actually gives the thing some humanity to it. Like in the 1979 film Alien, the movie made it out to be this monster that just kills and only because that is all it thinks. But in this movie, they make it out to be this thing that only does what it does to survive. The movie acknowledges that its an animal that does what animals do, survive. Although it isn't perfect and i'll talk about that now. Some of the people in this movie are almost completely disposable. Like Ryan Reynolds is cool in the scenes he is in, but he is seriously in the movie for almost 12 minutes before he is killed by the alien. The 2nd half of this movie is also not as intense as the 1st half. The ending also felt a little rushed to me. So in the end, Life is a very enjoyable science fiction horror movie that really doesn't add any thing new to the trapped in space horror genre, but it also earns its spot in that category as well. B- or 7/10",7,5,11,15 May 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Easily the best film of 2015
","After seeing the road warrior, i wanted to see if the great Australin director (George Miller) still had it in him to make very great action films, turned out that i was really enjoying this film. first the pros. So now that George Miller has a greater budget, he is able to do more with this film. First of all, there are great action scenes in this film. I've never seen greater action since Die Hard. The sets are good to. The whole set is just a desert, but that's what makes it good(after all the film is set in the apocalypse) The Villain is pretty cool to, he had a lot to do in this film. By the way i must warn you that this film is crazy. There are psychotic people everywhere in this film. For example, there's one part in the movie where the camera pans over a guy on a massive truck that is playing a guitar, and when he plays it fire shoots out of it.....enough said. The movie is sorta short on story, but when it is directed in a way that makes it fun and action packed then your going to have a great movie. So i really like Fury Road. It had great action, intense moments, and great direction. This is easily the best film of 2015.",10,1,7,20 August 2016
