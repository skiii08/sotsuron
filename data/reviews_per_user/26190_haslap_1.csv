The New World," Do Not Watch This Movie! It Is Very Very Bad!
","By far the worst movie I have seen. It is also stupidest movie about Native Americans I have ever seen. Directors and music composers thumbs should be cut of that they could never write or compose again. The movie was huge disappointment. Characters, hmm, actually there were no actual characters because they were so thin that seemed they had no motives at all and even their little motives like love was not explained at all. It was like all people in movie were empty shells just running around like chickens and actually doing nothing that makes sense. The actor of Pocahontas was just ugly and couldn't act at all and in hole movie she has like 15 lines and her face is in more close ups than Kevin Costner in Dances with the Wolfs. I don't understand how fine actors like Cristian Bale and Wes Studi got in to this movie but I guess they were cheated somehow. Colin Farrell is just awful as always. Bales and Studis characters were so thin and had so little own space that it makes me angry and sad same time.I really wonder what was point of this movie but There were no point! It was like historical art/nature movie. After first 15 minutes you just start to be bored to death and all time you wait that something would happen and some kind of storyline would appear, But It Never Happens! At the end of the movie you think some kind of conclusion with characters shallow motives would happen but it is with so less drama that after I would watch any soap opera and be delighted about how deep are the characters and that at least something is happening.Director! Comoon! Do drama instead of filming trees and goofy people dancing in the field and stop wasting our money. (I am glad that I didn't pay for this movie.)My conclusion was that director Malick should only film nature documents but its true that even in them there are more excitement, drama and life philosophy than in this movie (The New World).Personally I prefer watching Last of the Mohicans 20th time than watching this movie ever again!",1,0,3,19 July 2006
