Requiem for a Dream," It haunts
","The critic in me wants to dismiss this film as style over substance, as being too long on melodrama and too short on character, or at worst manipulating feelings against a habit (drug abuse) already generally known to be undesirable.But the human in me cannot deny how hauntingly beautiful the film's images are, how just hearing the film's string quartet theme stirs memories of the film's characters and their inexorable plummet towards self-destruction, how every time I think on Ellen Burstyn's last line I feel as though tears could come at any moment.Darren Aronofsky has painted a harrowing, at moments amusing, and in every way touching world in this movie.",10,0,0,1 February 2001
Thirteen Days," Feels like thirteen days...
","Good movies out of events in recent history can be done - just look at 'Apollo 13.' Unfortunately, 'Thirteen Days' fails to grip the viewer like 'Apollo 13.' The fault lies in Donaldson's overly dramatic direction coupled with restrained performances. The movie becomes much more interesting in its last half hour, but, alas, it is too late by this point. Perhaps in the hands of somebody like Ron Howard this one could have worked.",4,0,3,6 December 2000
Jurassic Park," My King Kong
","Steven Spielburg has mentioned the influence of the 1933 classic 'King Kong' on the making of 'Jurassic Park.' 'Kong' filled many a youngster (so I am told) back in those days with awe at larger-than-life creatures battling humans and each other.Well, 'Jurassic Park' was my 'King Kong.' It was the most thrilling, most terrifying, most FUN thing I had ever seen at the movie theater at that time. I stomped around the house pretending to be a dinosaur for days. Sometimes I still do when people aren't looking.Hopefully time will be kind to this film, if for no other reason so my future kids won't laugh at me too much when I show it to them.",10,3,4,1 February 2001
