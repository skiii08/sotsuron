Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GREAT !!!
","I find only a word to describe this movie: GREAT GREAT and GREAT again !!!!!!! I heard all the bad critiques before watching but when I came out from the theater the only thing I wanted to do was to see it again !!!! This movie is a must for all the people who love SW or Sci-Fi in general, what relief after years of 'ID4' 'Starship Troopers' 'Stargate' 'Lost in space' (remembering only the better movies). Thank you George !!",10,0,0,23 September 1999
