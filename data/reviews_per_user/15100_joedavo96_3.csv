Iron Man 3," So much hype, so much expectation, so much potential.
","Iron Man 3 could have been one of the greatest superhero films of all time but ultimately failed to live up to its true potential. While Downey Jr. yet again delivers a stellar portrayal of Tony Stark and there are a few great action scenes the plot eventually crumbles. This movie isn't awful but it's just a major disappointment, I personally blame the moronic writing and direction. One scene in particular will enrage comic book and Iron Man fans alike, I am neither of these and was still baffled as to how such experienced filmmakers could make such a big mistake. There are so many reasons why this movie should have been great and so many reasons why it wasn't, this truly is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. I am now deeply concerned as to where Marvel is heading with their universe and i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way. Let's hope Thor and Captain America can pick up the pieces and save the day because Iron Man needs some backup.",5,2,5,24 June 2013
World War Z," A movie about zombies, with no gore?
","While the script is surprisingly good, this film is unfortunately held back by lackluster acting and lacks any real emotional depth that one would expect from such a dark subject matter. Pitt is fine in his role but his portrayal is meaningless as we really have no idea who his character is. He formerly operated for the U.N. and is a family man at heart, that's about it. He lacks any real strengths or any real weaknesses, he pretty much just avoids 'zombies' the entire movie and uses common sense to find a cure. I also thought a lot of the CGI used in this movie was poorly done, and often unnecessary in my opinion. Another issue I had with this film was the 'zombies', these things are not zombies, if anything they are vampires. We never see them actually devour anyone, in fact all they do is bite people and then proceed to infect others, like vampires only these ones don't mind the sun. This film is no doubt hindered by its rating, who's idea was it to make a zombie movie without blood? This is not a zombie movie, this is an over-produced, uninspired CGI vampire-infested waste of time.",3,17,35,24 June 2013
Insidious," Scary, surreal and strange.
","Insidious is a horror film that doesn't rely on gore to scare its audience, it instead relies on an eerie atmosphere to frighten us. The paranormal and surreal aspects of the film are reminiscent of horror classics 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining'. Be warned, Insidious has plenty of jump scares. These jump scares however, unlike most today, are anything but cheap. The film's script as well as James Wan's direction is fantastic, giving the viewer a relentless sense of paranoia throughout the film's entirety. The plot surprisingly delves deep into a supernatural story that is hauntingly fascinating. The less you know before watching this movie, the better. Insidous will keep you up until 3:00am and give you a sense of urgency to make sure there is no one standing behind your bedroom window.",8,0,1,22 June 2013
