The Benchwarmers," Great Movie
","After reading numerous reviews on this website about this movie, I wasn't sure whether or not I should take my kids to see it (I have a 5 year old, a 6 year old and a 10 year old). However, after listening to them all beg for over an hour, I relented and we went. I have to disagree with all of the people who have made negative remarks about the movie and who said it's not appropriate for kids. The humor that was crude went right over their heads and we all found the movie to be entertaining and funny. I even enjoyed it and I usually don't like movies like this. However, if you have no sense of humor and are a general stick in the mud, you'd be better off seeing something else.",8,3,9,8 April 2006
