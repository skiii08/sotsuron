Deja Vu," I Liked It, But It Could've Been Better
","I went to go see this movie because of Denzel Washington. He's a great actor and smart guy. He usually chooses his starring roles carefully, so, my expectations were high. I was riveted by story and cinematography finesse UNTIL Doug Carlin (Denzel) decided to go back in time to 'get the girl'. From there on, it was a little too corny for me. The ending could've saved the story IF Carlin didn't 'come back to life'. If he would have 'stayed dead', the beautiful sub-theme of sacrifice and patriotism would have been better expressed. Overall, the action was great and camera-work splendid. I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I'll be buying the DVD.",6,2,4,27 November 2006
