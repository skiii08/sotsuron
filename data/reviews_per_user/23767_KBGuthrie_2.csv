Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Worst piece of crap in the history of Hollywood.
","I wish I knew the words that could convey my hatred of this second installment. All I can say, is that if you liked the first movie, just walk away from the second movie. Of the 2+ hours I sat in that chair, I'd say perhaps 10 minutes of it was worth my time.That may be generous.  I'm not sure it was that good.I'm seeking Hypnotherapy to see if I can have that thing expunged from my long term memory.",1,17,29,23 April 2004
Alexander," The movie didn't capture anything, except that Alexander was Gay.
","I would avoid this move if I were you. With the sole exception of the scenes in Persia. It did not impress me in the slightest. I get the Alexander was gay, but they spend way, way, way too much time driving that point home. If Alexander had spent that much time being gay and doing nothing but his boy toy, his own Officers would have killed him.Alexander was well...Great. He did incredible things. He did defeat the entire Persian Army while Vastly outnumbered. He did defeat all most every single army that faced him, no matter the odds.That point was made by the director only as a comment by Anthony Hopkins. You never really got a feel for it.Sorry, Gotta say that this movie is not worth the money.",2,1,2,27 November 2004
