The Avengers," More of them does not make for a better movie
","Deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here I decided to watch it, even though I didn't like Thor, couldn't sit through the propaganda that was Captain America, and thought that both of the Ironmen were only average. The movie is just fighting, explosions, destruction to infinity, and the action isn't anything that you haven't seen before. There is just more of it, which doesn't make it better - it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast. Scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one-liners, seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of 'God bless America, and make the rest of the world (or rather Universe) its colony.' Samuel L. Jackson was unbelievably terrible, Scarlett Johansson was terrible, and was that Sherlock Holmes wearing a suit of armor? I could have sworn that the character was the same, only the name was different. So much for Robert Downey's versatility. The rest of the cast followed suit. The only decent actor in this movie was Tom Hiddleston , but his character was ruined by the writers. Loki is supposed to be a god, but here he is so mediocre, that it is ridiculous. His 'mighty' spear is nothing more than a very low grade laser gun, which doubles as a mind control tool that doesn't work all of the time, and when it does work, it does not work all that well. The mighty, fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder, dropping like mosquitoes. Characters' level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment. There are 2 (yes, TWO) funny scenes, and both include the Hulk beating up people. That should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie. I guess to like this one you would either have to be a die hard fan of the Avengers, or a die hard fan of mindless, repetitive, boring action. This movie doesn't require suspension of belief to be enjoyed. It requires suspension of brain functions.",3,12,30,10 May 2012
Drive," Slow, boring and pretentious
","Very mild spoilers here, so it is OK to read if you haven't seen the movie, and want to be spared from that experience.After the high rating and rave reviews here, this movie was a huge disappointment.The pace is excruciatingly slow: for an hour pretty much nothing happens. We are mostly treated to empty stares, scenes that (I guess) were supposed to help character development, but really lead nowhere, and long, meaningless pauses during the few dialogues.
After an hour the pace picks up a bit, but without much more meaning to it.The main characters are one-dimensional and lack development. Gosling's character seems to be a sadistic psychopath, who was also scratched by autism just enough to take away all of his social skills. He spends the first hour doing nothing but looking mopey or just plain stupid, then, out of nothing, he starts to show bursts of anger and violence. That scene in the diner with a guy from a previous heist - what was that supposed to be? I guess it was meant to be a sort of transition, to show us what a badass he really is, but it was really lame and done badly.The plot is mostly nonexistent, and when it is there, it is completely ridiculous. Protagonist's actions and motivation make no sense. It seems that, apart form being a psychopath and autistic, he is also stupid, but, hey, at least he is good at brutally hurting people.Some people praised the music, but I found it unnecessarily loud, and mostly annoying, and the lyrics were so in your face, that I can only view them as parody ('A real human being and a real hero.' Really?)The graphic violence also seemed out of place and put in only for shock value.To sum it up, this movie had no plot, no character development, no sense, so it tried to be artsy, but only managed to be pretentious.",3,3,7,7 January 2019
