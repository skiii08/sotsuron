The King's Speech," The moment of endless suffering
","As the moment approaches, the fear seizes the heart, paralyzes the mind, and suffocates the lungs. In front of the moment, the tongue gets more tied, the words trapped in the throat, the looks of pity accentuates the discomfort. The moment seems an endless suffering. This is how a stutterer lives the moments of his 'handicap'.From the first scene of 'The King's Speech' you can feel and live the situation very truly, which made the success of the movie. The message is clear and strong, no matter how bad your situation is, it is possible to overcome it, and don't worry, you are not alone.--http://theearthdiary.blogspot.com/",8,1,3,19 June 2011
The Hurt Locker," The lost meaning of Truth, Justice, and Peace
","The hurt locker drag you deep in what a soldier can feel or became in a dirty war, you can feel during the movie what the soldiers feel, you feel that you are smothered by the scenes you've watched and experienced, you feel inhuman by the pain you've bring and done, you feel lost between your duty and your morals.In this kind of war we notice that almost all of the field soldiers are very young, which is an intentional choice of the war's makers, because the young ones are mentally very vulnerable, so very handy, then it is easy to switch the minds of the soldiers from the real world to a video game world and make them do horrible things to themselves and to the others.In the end, if you don't die in this real 'video game', you will belong to two categories, those who get used to this game and can not quit it, and those who get abused by this game, in the end the both categories will be threw in the real world with a hidden or obvious mental disorder.To avoid a catastrophe, we need new leaders, leaders who can redefine the true meaning of Truth, Justice, and Peace.--http://theearthdiary.blogspot.com/",5,1,2,3 February 2011
Inception," The power of dreams
","Inception is a movie about a very interesting subject, the dreams. In the movie Christopher Nolan shows how the dreams can be powerful, in a good way when it's used to maximize the potential of the mind; and in a bad way when it's harmful, used to penetrate deep in others mind to steal a secret or to plant an idea.The movie provides a good entertainment, but I think that it was insufficient; the 140 min was not enough to develop the complexity of the subject, that's why the characters were a little empty, and the story moves fast from one scene to another.Also in some parts of the movie I felt that I'm watching Batman, I don't know if it was deliberately or no, especially the music, from Hans Zimmer, I was waiting to be enchanted as usual, but I was not, and I found to many fragments that sounds like the soundtrack of Batman.Finally it is definitely not a bad movie, so enjoy it.Sincerely.--http://theearthdiary.blogspot.com/",6,1,4,30 December 2010
