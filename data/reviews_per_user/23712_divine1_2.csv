Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It cannot bring the nastalgia of the originals, but a GREAT piece in itself.
","All critics can bite us fanboys.  They probably didn't even like the original trilogy.  That's why you should never take a critic at his word. Unfortunately, I saw the CD track listing which gave away a major spoiler. I didn't feel the full impact of the ending because of that, but I can tell you the lightsaber duel puts Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to shame. Luckily the movie used cross-cuts to different action because when those guys were fighting, I didn't blink a wink because I didn't want to miss a thing.  I purposely forced myself to have low expectations of the movie because there is no way any movie could top the original in terms of nastalgia.  Having said that, this movie was done extremely well.  It kept me interested until about the beginning of the third act.  Can't wait to see the next one.  Can Spielberg direct it?  Probably not!",9,0,0,21 May 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Brought a tear to my eye.
",This is one of the only movies I bought before I saw it and let me tell you that it is worth it.  Jimmy Stewart IS an actor.  His performance was the driving force in this picture.  The story is so heart-warming that I could feel tears building up inside me.  Possibly becoming one of my all-time favorite movies.  Buy this movie on the THX-approved DVD.,Null,0,3,29 September 1998
