Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 2yr. old daughter's reaction
","I loved the movie.  But, the most important realization for me was seeing my 2yr. old daughter's reaction to the light-sabre fight between the Jedi's and Darth Maul.  She made motions with her hand and started yelling Yah! Yah!....  I realized then, that this is what Star Wars is about.  So much of my childhood centered around the movies and toys from the original, and now this is an experience much the same for a new generation.  The critics, I feel, have mis-understood the intent of this movie.  It's not to make history, or to appeal to movie-critics.  It's goal is to instill dreams (and make money).",10,5,7,23 May 1999
Dark City," One of the best movies I have ever seen
","This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  Not only is it incredible from a technical perspective, but the story is very creative, and the acting is superb.  This is a must see for any serious movie fan.",10,0,2,16 February 2000
