The Longest Yard," Just came back, and loved it.
","Although the previews made it seem like this movie was just a comedy.This movie had everything in it. It has a bit of comedy and a bit of drama. Even though Adam's shape wasn't exactly right, he made up for it in his acting. Adam was able to show a bit of both his terrific sides. his comedic side and dramatic side.I would love Adam to do more stuff exactly like this movie. Where both sides were shown.Since I am only 18 years old, I have never seen the first one. and that suits me just fine. Although the Gay Jokes were bad and some of the other ones were to, the acting by Reynolds and Sandler and some of the others totally make up for it. The football moves are worth it alone.",8,1,6,29 May 2005
