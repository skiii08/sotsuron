Raiders of the Lost Ark," Better than Star Wars
","Yes, I said it. Raiders is a better movie than Star Wars. There are no annoying robots or aliens and the acting Harrison displays in this film far exceeds his work in Stars Wars, plus the dialog is much better. It may not be the 'grand epic' that Star Wars is, but all in all it is a superior flick.This is a remarkable movie. The opening scene is one of the most memorable in all of film. It never slows down from there, and we never have to hear Harrison Ford say 'not me sister, I'm only in it for the money'.",Null,0,0,15 June 1999
