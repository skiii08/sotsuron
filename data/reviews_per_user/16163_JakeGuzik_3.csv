Skyfall," Skyfall = Great Entertainment
","To edit the standard formula in a rather radical way may not be very welcomed by the Bond purists but for me it worked very well. The film is superbly directed by Sam Mendes. The cinematography is fantastic (only for this it's worth to watch the film) and the story well beyond the most Bond movies in the last 30 years. Especially to give a little bit of an inside view into Bonds own history was a really great idea. The cast performance was absolutely outstanding. Besides the main Characters Judy Dench, Daniel Craig and Javier Bardem my favorite was Albert Finney – only with his presence he almost stole the show from everybody else. I didn't miss the gadgets but loved to see the DB5 in action again. What I enjoyed most were the many little reminiscences to 50 years Bond movie history and to setup the movie more like a drama rather then a thriller. And still there are plenty of thrilling moments as well as a couple of brilliant small and very funny dialogs in the film. Overall this movie holds the one promise where many recent mega-productions fail – to be top level movie entertainment (in all parts and aspects).",9,5,20,30 October 2012
Avengers: Endgame," Maximum mediocrity
","This film was too long.
The dialogues were boring and formalistic
Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity.
It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.",4,28,42,12 May 2019
Clash of the Titans," G.I. Joe goes Underworld
","Watching this new version of a 1980s classic movie I was hopping for a similar gripping story line and some fantastic special effects. The story is lame (to call it shallow even would be some kind of compliment), the actors are everything but inspired (Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are a total disaster)and the special effects somewhere between boring and so confusing that you can hardly watch it. And in between the lines you find G.I. Joe fight for whatever propaganda - trying to take the watchers for fools. This movie was the worst big production I have seen in many years and easily qualifies for many many Razzies. Overall a superbly annoying waste of time!!!!!",1,2,3,25 August 2010
