Armageddon," classic
",This is the one summer movie I would spend $7 on over and over  again. Is it the best plot? NO.  Is there a lot of unrealistic stuff? YES especially the stuff on MIR.  but its just pure testosterone   special effects and great camera work. This movie sets out to be huge and awe inspiring and it does it.  Its like Con Air on crank.  The cast makes a great teamThis is another at least 9 out of 10,10,2,3,22 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," WOW
","Hold on to your seats ...and stomachs  for the first 40 minutes of  nonstoI violence the best show of what war is like I have ever seen the non stop fire of bullets just amazed me that that really happened.  Just a little note here fellas, be sure to check out the grand-daughter in the purple shirt at the beginning  it's well worth the effort.  Hanks deserves his third Oscar he should get the one he missed for Apollo 13. This is at least a 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,22 September 1998
This Is Spinal Tap," the film that goes to 11
","What can be said about this movie that hasn't said before?  It's great.  The cast works well together, they feel like a real band and no matter how far out they are you know that there are bands out there like that. Harry Shear seems to be man out  although it does fit the bass player mould.  David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean is great and has some wonderful lines.  But Chris Guest steals the show as the guitar player Nigel.  The catering scene before a concert, talking about his Skelton shirt, showing his guitars and amps to Rob Riner, everything is just too much to list.  One other trade mark scene is talking about the history of the band perticularly drummers.so in conclusion a movie any rock fan must see this is a moive that ona scale of 1 to 10 is well what else 11",10,0,1,22 September 1998
There's Something About Mary," Somthing about Cameron
","Everything about this movie works.  It's not just a crude movie.  It's a good story that keeps you into it more then just waiting for the next punchline. Cameron is great.  Being the incredibly sweet gorgeous female without being unbelievably sweet.   The only thing that I didn't like was the zipper scene. It was a good scene but I could have done with out the visual joke, it still creeps me out.  with the pace this thing is on you almost have to wonder about a sequel. I give this a 8 out of 10",10,0,0,22 September 1998
