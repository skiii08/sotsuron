Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Probably my most nostalgic Star Wars movie in the saga!
","The year is 1999. I am about 7 years old, and not yet seen a Star Wars movie in theatres. Thus the stage was set for my experience with Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace.Ok, so first and foremost, I realize that Ep. I is not the best of the best, but I still quite enjoy watching it. It's fun, fast-paced (for the most part) and has frickin' Darth Maul in it!!! The story at time drags a bit and some of the dialogue isn't all that great, but there are definitely still many moments that unleash that inner kid in you, i.e. the Podracers, the epic battles at the end and that amazing lightsaber duel! I do like this entry in the saga, and every time I watch it, I go back to a somewhat simpler time; when the stresses of everyday life hadn't yet sunk in. Overall, I enjoy Ep. I and all the memories it sets off. The Force will be with you...always.",7,3,4,4 September 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Such a different, but awesome Star Wars movie!!!
","When the spinoff movies were announced, I wasn't sure how to process it. Yet, Rogue One was a sure surprise! The story of how the Rebels stole the plans to the Death Star was such a brilliant idea! The movie gives us a well-paced, well-acted adventure that takes us back to the days of the original trilogy. While everyone's complained about the lack of character development, I enjoy the characters and not just K2SO, even though he's awesome! In all, Rogue One is fantastic with an ending that will leave you breathless! The Force will be with you...always.",9,2,4,4 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Tremendous finale to cement the original trilogy as one of the best trilogies of all time!!!
","Fast, fun and freakin' awesome! The third film in the original Star Wars trilogy is definitely a step down from its predecessor, but is no a doubt a fitting, satisfying conclusion to the legendary original Star Wars trilogy!The themes from the last two films are here and are very rich! The action is fun and fast-paced, the dramatic stuff is moving and the Ewoks, who get waaaaay too much hate, are awesome!!! If you haven't seen Return of the Jedi, you simply must...especially if you've just watched the first two entrees. The Force will be with you...always!",9,1,2,31 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Ok....Episode II.
","To get right to it, Attack of the Clones, Episode II, to me, is the weakest film in the saga. Now, don't get me wrong, there are moments that do stand out in the grand scope of the franchise, like the battle sequences and the lightsaber between Jedi Master Yoda and Count Dooku (which I do love). However, the dialogue between Anakin and Padme is really what kills me; it really is NOT good. I'm part of the minority that doesn't think Hayden did a bad job with Anakin, but his scenes with Natalie Portman can be hard to watch. Other than that, I do like the plot with the clones, although I wish Lucas would've made the decision to pick an actor to play Jango who sounded more like the actor who played Boba in the theathercial release of Empire Strikes Back, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku and, of course, Ewan McGregor's take on young Obi-Wan Kenobi! Is AotC horrible? No, not to me. It's just not the best. The Force will be with you...always.",7,0,1,4 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Probably the most divisive movie of all time!
","I LOVE STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII-THE LAST JEDI!!!!! I do NOT understand the brutal hate this movie gets!!!! Is it perfect? No. What film is? Here are my pros and cons: Cons: Finn and Rose's story is a bit weak. I do agree that the storyline with Finn and Rose is the weakest part of the film, perhaps even pointless.Pros: Everything else!!!! While the story for Finn and Rose was weak, the stuff between Rey, Kylo Ren and Luke is utterly fantastic! To start, Mark Hamill is so great in this movie! Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver again knock it out of the park! Had they focused more on this aspect of the story, I feel it would've been better received.Keep in mind, this is only part 2 in a trilogy; the story's not over yet! Hold the hate until the complete story is told! The Force will be with you...always.",9,4,27,4 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of the saga...or so we all thought!
","May 2005, was a very exciting time! You see, new Star Wars fans, we all thought this was the end; this was the one we had all waited for!Revenge of the Sith is without the best of the prequels. While some of the dialogue and performances aren't up to par, the story, the action and the emotion is all there! Ewan is superb here, playing Kenobi on point! And, I think, Hayden is fantastic as Anakin! He displays his tragic fall to the Dark Side very well, becoming haunted by his dark deeds. The final confrontation between he and Obi-Wan is without a doubt one of the best of the saga; it's such a personal conflict riddled with intense action and steeped it deep feeling. Ep. III also gives us a battle I wasn't expecting-between our 'little green friend' and the Emperor, and what a battle it is! Overall, RotS is great, with some flaws; still the best of the prequels. The Force will be with you...always.",8,1,2,4 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 10 years felt like so long!
","It had been 10 years since the last entry in the Star Wars saga, and it was worth the wait! So many have ragged on the sequel trilogy thus far and starting with the first, I WILL be defending it! Episode VII is a great film; a excellent part of the Star Wars franchise! It introduced us to great, new characters and brought back our well-known old ones. The storytelling on display here is fantastic, Kylo Ren is superb villain, played tremendously by Adam Driver and the mystery of Daisy Ridley's Rey is extremely interesting to me and I can't wait to see how her story wraps up. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are also great here in their respected roles as Finn and Poe. Harrison Ford coming back as Han Solo is just the icing on the cake! I get so tired of hearing people complaining about the last few episodes in the Skywalker story! We wanted good, new Star Wars and we got it! Stop complaining and may the Force be with you...always.",9,2,41,4 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Brilliant filmmaking!!! Wonderful movie!!! Start of a legacy!!!
","I was first introduced to the universe of Star Wars at age 5 with our VHS tapes, and I've been hooked since! Star Wars has to be my favorite film series hands down, given it's had some rocky roads. (Which film series hasn't!?) Everything about this first film is spectacular! The visuals (which still hold up even after 40 years!), the production design, the score, omg the score...classic! The acting is great from everyone, especially Sir Alec Guinness and Harrison Ford, who both ooze cool. I've seen Star Wars probably, and no lie, about 1 million times, and still has yet to get to old! If you have never this Star Wars, it is a must! It will sweep you away with it's marvelous characters, epic, old-fashioned storytelling and, again, timeless visuals. May the Force be with you...always!",10,0,1,31 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Everything Star Wars was, is and needs to be!!!
","The sequel to the film that changed filmmaking is hands down my favorite film of ALL time!!!! I love this movie!!!The Empire Strikes Back simply is, in my opinion, the best sequel ever made! (With The Godfather, Part II, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and The Dark Knight following suite.) To me, there's nothing this movie doesn't have! It has action, drama, romance and humor! All the best part of Star Wars were amped up here!! A deeply compelling story moves our heroes to new, more daring places (both geographically and emotionally!) The tension between the fight against good and evil is truly magnificent! The bantor between characters is hilarious! The action is exhilarating! And the ending is classic! If you haven't seen The Empire Strikes Back, your missing out on, yes, on of the greatest sequels ever made, but also one of the best films ever made! The Force be with you...always!",10,1,2,31 August 2018
