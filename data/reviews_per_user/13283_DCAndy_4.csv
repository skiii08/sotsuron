Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," preparing for the future
","Overall, I thought this was a great start to the 'new trilogy' of Star Wars movies. Visually, of course, it is stunning, but there are some very sophisticated themes that Lucas is introducing here. They will later become crucial to the whole Star Wars saga. For example, the lightsaber fight at the end of the movie -- besides being possibly the best fight of sci-fi history -- turns out to have fateful consequences unforseen by those involved. Also, I found the young Anakin's gift with machines to be a chilling counterpoint to his eventual robotic fate. Overall, despite the universally-loathed Jar Jar Binks, I gave this one an 8/10 -- and that would possibly go up as the new movies continue to add context.",10,0,0,31 May 1999
Lifeboat," good, but not Hitchcock's best
","I must say I was a little disappointed  in Lifeboat, but mostly because I thought it didn't pack the usual punch of a Hitchcock ending. I was expecting more, so I found the end a bit anticlimactic. But it's still a good movie with a set of interesting characters facing moral dilemmas without being able to avoid or escape from them.",7,2,10,31 May 1999
Pulp Fiction," watch it twice!
","Pulp Fiction turns a lot of people off at first with its violence and its nonlinear plot, but on subsequent viewings the movie improves by leaps and bounds. Every time you watch it you will catch more nuances, you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. I'm not even talking about Tarantino (even though I feel this is his best.) Watch how many details the actors put into their roles, the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman are obvious standouts, and Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel are also quite good. Christopher Walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. So even if you didn't care for it the first time, give it another try. And if you liked it the first time, buy a copy and watch it until it wears out (like mine just did!)",10,0,0,31 May 1999
The Great Escape," good prison film
","I remember loving the Great Escape as my parents watched it when I was a kid. Having seen it again recently, it surprised me how many prison movies since have borrowed from it. Many bits in The Great Escape have since become standard in prison-break movies, and the combination here is very well used. It's a great movie packed with quality actors. And of course, half the fun is guessing who will make it and who won't...",9,2,4,31 May 1999
