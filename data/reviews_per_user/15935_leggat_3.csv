Lucky Number Slevin," I love great movies and I love this!
","I've seen some negative reviews on this movie and I don't understand why. From start to finish it had me intrigued, laughing and on the edge of my seat. It has the feel of a Guy Ritchie film because there are some brutal and humorous scenes in it.The chemistry between Harnett & Lui is fantastic. In fact, all the actors do a fine job and the cast were wonderfully chosen. Bruce Willis particularly impressed me playing a heartless, world-class assassin.Watch out for some very subtle hints in certain scenes, which you may or may not get, but either way I am confident you will be satisfied come the end of this movie.",8,2,10,28 February 2006
American Psycho," I loved it...you might not.
","This film shows you exactly what it's like to be a yuppie during the 1980's in New York. In that time you were considered a nobody unless you had a great job, great clothes and lots of money. Patrick Bateman gets rather bored of it all and embarks on nights of murder and ultra violence in order to brighten up his dull little life. I found this film very entertaining and was surprised and full of joy by discovering the shocking truth at the end. If you like films like that (Fight Club, Vanilla Sky or Phonebooth) then I would really recommend this film to you. It's not exactly been getting rave reviews everywhere, but I think it's very underrated and deserves more credit. Christian Bale plays the role to perfection. ****/5",10,0,1,21 May 2004
The Dark Knight," A great sequel...Ledger stole the show
","The Dark Knight is perhaps better than the original, Batman Begins, in my opinion, but as well as being that it's also a great chance for people to watch, remember and think about Heath Ledger. As the Joker he gives a superb last performance, stealing practically every scene which he featured inÂ—he was both frightening and funny. The film in general is certainly more complicated than any other hero movie I've seen before; lots of goodies and baddies, plots and twists that made it a little difficult to keep up with for adults, let alone children. It's certainly something I'll have to see again when it comes out of DVD. It's still a great movie nonetheless and everyone should see it. Harvey Dent was a good introduction, giving a fresh angle to the plot, while Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman reprise their roles well as Batman's allies. What more can I say without spoiling it? It has great action, breathtaking and well-thought of stunts and is destined to be a real hit for years to come.",6,1,5,28 July 2008
