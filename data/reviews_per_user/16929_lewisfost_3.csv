Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Star wars of my generation (but not as good as the originals)
","Okay so i was bought the prequel trilogy on christmas in around 2005/6 and they were my first experience of star wars as a fan, and let me say they were perfect and amazing especially as a child, then i was lucky enough to realise where they all came from and found the original trilogy which was even better. anyway back to this movie.
I'll do things i like and things i don't and expand on a couple a bit further on.LikesBest lightsaber choreography in possibly any movie so farEwan mcgreggor and liam neeson and natalie portmans performances and ian mcdarmoid's aswellsome of the best star wars music in duel of the fatesnaboo as a planet is great along with the sleek design of the chrome ships and fighters, brilliant design,battle droids are a nice addition to the universe including droidekas,jedi order shown in their prime, jedi knights are feared and deified across the galaxy as we were promised.darth maul is a un-complex but believable villain, as is the greedy goals of the trade federation puppeted by Darth Sidious,slaving and life on Tatooine is believable but different than anh,watto is also a good scoundrel,Dislikes
Jar jar ( i know right) the comic relief is partly unnecessary but on reflection as an adult the child like talking does get old quickly as does his relevance in the film gungans are a interesting new race though.Darth maul in my opinion would have been a good character for anakin to kill in anger maybe at the start of ep2 getting revenge for the death of qui gon showing how powerful he had become ,obi wan becoming angry to beat him was good to watch but served no other end.Anakin Skywalker, this is one of my hardest things to explain i''ll try my best below.green screen creatures and scenes just a few too many in my opinion not loads like some people said but enough to notice easily on some viewings,ric olle the naboo ship captain seems far to enthusiastic in his talking somthing i noticed several times which was a shame but it really seemed like someone acting in a otherwise convincing world.force running, used in the opening battle by qui gon and obi wan never seen or heard from again very strange and a mistake to include in my opinion.destroying the enemy spherical ship is too much like the death star in my opinion and the fact it wipes out the droids is a great convenienceokay so to elaborate of a couple of points,good,the music is great in this film it really adds to the feel my favourite moments are the duel of fates and the crescendo when qui gon nearly cut his way into the trade federation bridge effectively showcasing the power of a jedi.ligtsaber choreography, it really is amazing, having seen this first and then the originals i could not believe the difference, i know why the originals were like they were but this choreography of three fighters and a double bladed weapon look amazing to watch. even the brief encounter on tatooine is amazing to watch the energy and concentration really showcase how amazing the sith and the Jedi can be when duelling each other.and the badAnakin skywalkerso to be honest i think jake lloyd's acting is very good and the lines he has to work with aren't shocking but could be better, i think that george lucas wasn't great at growing love stories from characters, and the instant connection between padme and anakin does seem a bit strange, especially when she says she cares for him, my main problem being it does not seem as if there are five years between them padme seems older than 14. also the fact that anakin would leave his mother so easily is a bit annoying and the fact he dosen't come back with a lightsaber or money and free her earlier.
i don't dislike us seeing darth vader as this child in the first episode but i think there would have been no problem with him already being a teen or something along that lines. one of the saving graces is that we see anakins main weakness at not being able to let go being noticed hear something we get frankly too much of in the next two films. also the lack of emotion a qui gon dying is really annoying to me, the man who rescued you and is your idol dies and at his funeral your asking whats happening to you? bit strange.okay so to try and sum up my overall feelings, the special effects are well used but only occasionally overused in my opinion, the addition of 2rd2 and c3p0 is very fortunate that they happen to originate so close to home but its still nice to see them. qui gon and obi wan are real heroes of this film for me in their actions and in their words. padme's lines are to be honest pretty rubish but the conviction of natalie portman helps a lot and she becomes the strong woman she needs to be a leia and lukes mother.This was one of the only films that could have any starting point it could but still had to set up a destination 3 films on i think they did a goo job at creating the world we hear about from obi wan in ep4 and we see a corrupt republic and powerful sith lord waiting. darth maul is underused but still does good in his time especially as a visually powerful sith a nice counterpart to the power and presence we see in vader and sidious. for me it was a great star wars film in my child hood and is still today, wierdly maybe because of the time gap in the story it does have this strange feel as a standalone in the trilogy and the saga but nevertheless is a good cornerstone to start the saga chronologically,
and for this reason it deserves more credit than it gets,
i'm inclined to think it may be better than ep2 but i'll see when i review that one. although its not in my top 3 of the first six films it does a great job at keeping the franchise in a good place as long as you can look past some iffy cgi and iffy cgi comic relief!!",8,8,10,6 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," don't believe all these unhappy fans
","To start if you don't want to read all my review please if you do anything read the last couple of lines!!!What the franchise needed, not romanticised like the prequels and not fan service to ep4 like 7 was, just good honest emotional space opera at its finest. sure there are quirks but when you reflect on these they are swamped by the enormity of a fantastic film that has been pulled off here. if you are sore about the changes in the whole universe just remember how much previous films changed the universe etc. reminds me of that dark knight quote not what fans wanted but what fans needed.I could go on and yes there are some fair comments on how little was actually achieved in terms of rey's training, the premise of snoke etc, but what do Disney expect when a different director is hired for the next film should he pander to the questions raised from the previous one, well they have been but not to the extent the oh so clever fans expected. i'm glad this film has some originality in it in comparison to 7 which although had some amazing new characters has far too many similarities to 4 making me think it was played a bit safe to intro the new trilogy. anyway about this film. my only niggles and i believe in an honest review it should be only fair to comment both ways, was the bad good bad good bad (yes it that many , swings of the code breaker character, hopefully he returns in 9 and gets resolved a bit more. (kind of like Lando) maybe realising the error of his ways and joining the new republic. that and the whole casino arc was a bit useless other than subtle moments of animal rights and inspiring force sensitives which i doubt would pay off in the next movie unless there is a big time gap (which i'm hoping there is).
That and no actual lightsaber with lightsaber combat. the scramble of a duel in 7 was hoping for a bigger payoff after more training in 8 but alas it was not to be. overall i was decided after seeing it once, it was either fantastic but not in a normal way or a let down. after seeing it twice it for me is worthy of my high star rating. far from perfect, but so am i for expecting a star wars movie to ever get 10 out of 10 with so much expectation to fill. but all the same it was new and fresh and for something new and fresh to blow my expectations away and get 9/10 for me should be testament to how good it is , at least in my eyes. 
for me episode 3 really had the series best in terms of action especially on a galaxy wide stakes front, although poor scripting etc made it lack the heart which really lowered it in terms of its ranking by many. (don't get me wrong its not my faviourite)if episode 9 has the high stakes and action of 3 while holding onto the emotion that 5 and 8 had it should be good as a finale. so to reflect this is not as good as my favourites 4 and 5 but it really does have a sense of standalone to it that may make it something to comeback to when movies like a lot of the prequel trilogy can sometimes feel samey. sure not a lot actually happened but i'd take that any day over the likes of some previous films that traded emotional honest moments for forced (forgive the pun) plot movement and unconvincing character interactions. people are moaning about the u turn on the fans. this film has been made to be star wars which i like as a fan. not for a fan of star wars. like ep4 people liked it because it was original. this is that. and if your an avid fan like me you get your fan moments too : Admiral Ackbar (rip), a wings, ep4 hologram, mon calmari cruiser shield effects and hyperspace jumps, at-at's alongside the new ones. and many many quotes about previous events. but this is my view please make your own.",8,1,3,28 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," amazing star wars for a new era, but Disney's controlling string are noticeable.
","Right so having seen this film several times both in cinema and now more recently 3 years on (can't believe it right) It stands up to the test of time especially after a sequel in the same time period has been made.One of the things i want to get off my chest before i go into how much i like my film is probably its biggest flaw and although most people already know it i believe it is worth mentioning as it partly defines the film.Similarities with ep4/5yes i know its part of the skywalker saga but the problem arises when you realise how much the similarities are and were they so obvious when making it?
here is my list.inheriting anakin's lightsaberOld war hero helping main protagonist on getting away from their old life and sacrificing themselves while confronting an old close relationship enemy after helping get rid of shields on a massive battlestationplanet destroying battlestation with one spot weakness to blow up. with countdown to it firingprotagonist living poor on a sandfilled backwater planet.droid with important information finding protagonist.bad guy with mask and cape.bag guys boss appearing as a hologram teasing future encounters, (a let down to be)the list could go on and on but there are a few really annoying ones,.okay so to finish off my negatives. the lightsaber is definitely misunderstood in this film. although Finn and rey can't use it properly and kylo is hurt, they should not be that effective at being able to wield it even with force sensitive powers. episodes 1-6 explain why no one else wields a lightsaber, due to requiring years of training to use.there may be some other negatives but beside what i've mentioned and po and rey apparently never meeting it is mostly good for the following reasons i'll list a few and then talk about whySpecial effects both cgi and practical look the best they ever have and are put to good usemain character castings and characteristics are amazing, finn rey poe even kylo are easy to believe and understand (i'll explain more on ren later)inclusion of han solo chewie r2d2 c3p0 Leia Ackbar is a good thing for continuity and nostalgia.xwing's and star destroyers albeit updated is great to see.jakku takodana, resistance base, star killer base all look amazing as locations.battle of jakku remains of imperial fleet looks amazing and ties in with the fall of the empire expertly.Story line is easy to follow its skips around planets a bit but jumps between characters feel natural and progress the story and arent forced.the story of rey and finn becoming something greater as individuals is perfect space opera in my opinion as is there growing as characters throughout the film.Okay so to talk bit more about why i like this film.Kylo is flawed but still menacing, from the moment he takes his mask of you realise he is pretending to be sith to both scare others but to convince himself. and this turmoil both makes him volatile but also vulnerable which is nicely shown when rey reads him mind during her interrogation. His lightsaber which looks very volatile sums his thoughts up perfectly.Han solos death is a good reminder that this film is not about the old characters and old ones help propel new ones along much like that of obi wan in the originals , still an iconic character but was around for less than a third of the original trilogy.Poe is a good character that shows that hope exists in the galaxy and he is a good reminder that the first order conflict is real he is also a good reminder of how inspiring leia is and how she rallies troops.Rey is the best part of the film in my opinion, Her character is that of someone who is strong in their comptencies and beliefs but is thrust into a world of the force and greater conflict. her natural grasp of the force is a great thing to see much like how luke started off although her use is more visual and a bit quicker in how she uses it.She denies her destiny in the flashback scene which i think visually is great. her connection with finn is fantastic and they bounce off each other amazingly as does the subtle notion that she can handle herself as a woman and why shouldn't she? which i think is a great message not being over the top but very inspiring for young viewers.I like the fact that the movie is happy to say the rebellion won in ep6 but turmoil is stil part of this universe, (it is star wars after all)
Luke's disappearance is a good reason for this as is the rise of kylo renThe amazing thing about this film is that it sets up for the send two films perfectly although the cliff hanger ending does unfortunately say there can be no time jump something every star wars film has had however small.it also sets up snoke the knights of ren and luke traning rey as well as kylo ren becoming stronger and an epic battle between the first order and the resistance.without talking about the last jedi too much looking back i am disappointed much of this potential is wasted and i get reminded about it too much watching tfa which is a real shame.
on that note the only problem with phasma is that the was hyped up too much before the release of the film. the reason a boba fett character worked was that he became a favourite despite his lack of involvement in the films which means phasma was being set up to fail.to sum up this film i would say that the effects are amazing and are pure star wars for me, the planets and ships all look amazing and its nice they're new. the old characters do their part well in passing on the baton as do the new characters in cementing their part in the world,You really root for the good guys in this film and although you mind always says its not as good as the originals it stands well on its own. unfortunatley disney probably said it needs to be a bit and star wars for a new generation which meant jj abrams felt complied to make it like the original to play it safe,i don't mind it too much but it probably the only thing stopping it being a 9 or a ten for me.",8,3,35,2 January 2019
