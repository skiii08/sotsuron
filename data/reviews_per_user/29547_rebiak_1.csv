Iron Man 3," THEY MADE A BIG JOKE OUT of iron man
","This movie completely contradicts and goes against its previous parts like iron man and iron man2 avengers, 1 The iron man suits in the movie seem to break like they are made of tin can. a truck going at 40 miles an hour seem to be enough to trash iron mans suit into 30 pieces, 2 The iron man suit withstands Thor's lightning and iron man2 villains crazy electric whip thing, BUT IN THIS MOVIE SUIT BREAKS DOWN AND MELTS IN JUST 3000C.3 The iron man suit in this movie charges on a car battery and other house hold power sources like a cellphone or i pad but previous movies in the past suggest iron man suit is powered by its small n powerful arc reactor.5 In this movie iron mans suit is ripped in half, trashed into pieces in less than 10 secs by just one or may be two blows. Not to forget the suit melts very quickly like butter.6 For iron man to continue wear this suits and play iron man in this movie because of quick trashing of his suits into pieces they have shown excessive and endless supply of iron man suits (STUPID DD!!!!!)7 Final joke on iron man and the fans that went to see it is that iron man suits are used replacing fireworks to explode in the air as fireworks it looks pretty lame and pathetic.THIS MOVIE IS SO DAMAGED by its director that he needs to be kicked out of every production he may be on, he took a good movie a good plot and ruined it for fans this guy does not even have common sense that how can u charge iron mans suit like a laptop. or trash it so many times in this movie. this guy destroyed iron man for us AND MADE A NASTY JOKE OUT OF IRON MAN AND HIS SUIT. do not spend Ur movie in theater to watch this crap wait for it come on the cable or DVD.",1,9,20,17 July 2013
