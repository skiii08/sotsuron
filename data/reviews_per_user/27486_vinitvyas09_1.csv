Skyfall," Actors ensure that 'sky' is the only limit; Plot makes this take a 'fall'
","////////---- NO Spoilers----////////The Start: The dazzling 007 defiantly chases a guy; performs breathtaking stunts; jumps over a train from a bridge (whilst on a goddamn bike!). Romance-loving-action-hating-men can't dismiss this as too fantastic (coz it ain't!) while vicarious-pleasure-taking-Bond-smitten-dudes can't say this to be an uncharacteristically toned down Bond action! (same reason). You see, such is the perfection of this scene, that it not only (seems to) justify the reboot in 10 minutes, but also results in becoming one the 2 best opening sequences this year (you've probably guessed the other one, TDKR). Problem? Yes, it is never topped in the remaining 130-odd min.The Middle: The movie paces inconsistently; M is the focus; not Bond. Even a hardcore fan will concede that Bérénice Marlohe is deliberately stuffed in. Editing her out will change the movie by 1% in terms of plot; 99% in terms of glamor. Only the jitter-inducing, surprisingly funny, and succinctly 'different' Bardem, while plotting to kill Bond, salvages this Bond movie (how ironic)!The remaining: The climax is dragged a bit, average action sequences with a rare brush of adrenaline-pumping brilliance notwithstanding, it's the spectacle that you'll see which'll inspire awe. Speaking of which, the other spontaneous cry to the director Mendes would be 'I can understand not handing an explosive pen to Bond to avoid clichés, but why for heaven's sake would he use an almost jammed & rusted weapon? Why a vintage car for a guy who's all about modernity?' Also Ralph Fiennes is so underused, you almost sense that there must be a huge compensation towards the end. At his role, Ian Fleming readers will cringe, Bond fans might feel satisfied while the others might not care that much (Sorry, that's all I can say without spoiling :-[ )Overall: Technically, an excellent movie; hence excellent reviews. But, the plot is weak. Usually, we've seen that when an adapted story has a weak plot, there is a deliberate attempt to twist the original storyline. Hence, creating the illusion of difference which that twist rubs off on the movie.Stars: Dench is convincing; Daniel Craig is awesome as our 'humanised' Bond; but it is Bardem who steals the show. Academy nomination? I wish!Direction is full of energy. The interesting part is that it was a lesser risk for Mendes with Bond as he is not really a hero per se, but more of a 'star'. However, is the keenness to stamp your style on an age-old ageless star valid at the cost of slightly belying his personality? That you judge.The movie is definitely not bad; but it leaves you with nothing much to remember about: Cause#1? Not enough adrenaline pumping action. Surprisingly low when you expect a stylized action Bond flick. Cause#2- Weak plot. No underlying purpose (unlike a ruthless young Bond wanting to rise in Casino Royale). There is an attempt to intellectualize the plot, but it comes at the cost of not providing details (not the Nolan-isque method of weaving a storyline capable of numerous subjective interpretations).Finally, I believe Bond fans must see this. People wanting to see intense acting of Craig and Bardem must as well. Others, well, renting a DVD would be much, much better.",7,1,2,12 April 2015
