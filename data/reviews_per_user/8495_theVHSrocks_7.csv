Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny not too funny and legitimately offensive and not in a good way
","I laughed a number of times during Borat, which was a funny film. A number of scenes are inspired, and I dig the whole clueless foreigner shtick. The film, done in a semi-documentary style, where the people don't know it's a movie, is about Borat, a Kazak newsreporter that comes to the United States to make a documentary only to have chaos ensue. Being based off a character on the Ali G show, I always thought that the character, Ali G had more funny scenes on that show, and this one disappointingly recycles gags from the show, but overall the gags remain new and enticing the way through. However, the biggest creative problem is that the character of Borat, himself, is one joke, and that joke starts to become thin. In fact, he is so one-dimensional that it kind of brings down the movie by making it too one-note in that department, but the strength of the supporting material keeps it afloat. It's a sure 7 out of 10.I must also say that while I do not mind the cruelest of humor in fictional settings, the fact that this deals with real people, who are speaking without knowledge of the joke, adds an unnaceptable edge to some of the humor. The things they do to some of these real people are simply mean and disrespectful. I always felt that in the television show, there was always an element of warmness to various fake interviews and sketches, but I only got that in a few of the bits here. This doesn't affect whether it's a good movie or not, but I just want to say that I don't approve of humor that hurts real people, without their knowledge.",7,3,14,3 June 2007
Crash," Message: Racism is a complex issue...
","I can't say that upon viewing Crash I was of a completely open mind. I had read criticism, both positive and negative with it, and the movie had won the Oscar for Best Picture. I can say, though, that I was ready to expect it to either be very good, good, or not so good. It was not so good, but with elements that were both good and very good.Crash is the kind of idea that can go sour or work. It is a Magnolia-esquire series of interplaying vignettes, of which the primary focus and theme is racism. It can work, if the director chose to, while focusing on racism, allow a human story to be the main focus and transcending feature. Honestly, racism isn't that interesting on its own, as a constant focus.However, the movie makes the cardinal flaw of keeping to racism a constant focus with the human story in the background, at least in terms of the way it feels. The characters talk, and they show affection but with a few exceptions (which make up some of the most memorable quiet scenes), their words almost always are about racism in some direct or indirect way. Such as, most blatantly, the articulate gangbanger, who can't help but always philosophize on racial issues. This however was interesting, purely in a pop-conversation way, with the real problem being that the vast majority of the other characters, talk about race in a similar way (based on their context) only not in a Tarantino-like jaunt. The movie is filmed like a character drama of true human context, and so we don't want to see race being the purpose of every conversation, particularly those of more human characters like a Black TV Writer and Assistant DA, who just talk about a singular issue in virtually every single situation they are in.This is the greatest flaw of the film, but it is not the only significant one. The film is too short, and characters, especially interesting ones like the complex and bigoted cop or the caring father of a locksmith (the one major character who almost completely avoids the issue of race and thus has the best scenes), come off as either underdeveloped or under-seen because we love them so much. This is expounded because the movie relies on coda scenes to wrap up the stories, and a few them, simply do not work. The characters are too underdeveloped for these to have an impact. The final third of the movie also seems to comprised entirely of this, so it gets tiresome, when it feels like the movie just had an 'end movie on this note' scene literally 10 times prior to the current scene that also feels like an 'end movie on this note' scene.However, there is good in the movie. The film, although it can be tiresome and its structural flaws are apparent, never really becomes painful or devoid of entertainment. There are enough interesting elements and good scenes to make the movie a decent viewing experience, however not a particularly worthwhile, satisfying, or greatly entertaining one.",5,12,18,13 March 2007
Barry Lyndon," I used to love it, but now I realize it's mediocre
","I used to love the movie, but now, I realize that while it has amazing cinematography, the film itself is boring. It's put together in a brilliant way, but the story is just not compelling. Not to say that there aren't sequences of beauty and brilliance, but I realize now that my love was for the cinematography and craft of Stanley Kubrick not the entertainment value of the film, which just wasn't very watchable. If you wanna see Kubrick at his most artful, well that's Barry Lyndon, but A Clockwork Orange is a close second, and what I really wish is that Kubrick could have put all the brilliance he put into Barry Lyndon into a good film. I also wonder, if the film had originally been as sexually explicit as the original version before it was edited down to PG, would it have been better.",6,7,15,3 June 2007
"Girl, Interrupted"," I feel very guilty about loving this movie: A Subjective Review
","Fine, I admit, despite the fact that I am anti-psychiatry in a way that would even put Tom Cruise to shame, I adore the idea of the mental hospital and related concepts within a fiction realm. Despite the fact I would probably kill myself, if I were committed in real life, if I had a holodeck from Star Trek, you could only guess the scenarios I'd be creating for myself. Okay, so I am biased. Mental Hospitals give me great me pleasures, even when I just think of them. It's something about a person being considered non-accountable and not of sound psyche as well as being worthy of confinement for just their demeanor and attitudes that I think with me really just strikes bunches of chords. So, upon seeing a movie that did not only meet that but heterosexually fascination of women I immediately sought it out. However, such a non-sexual fetish as this is not something you would want to make public, so I naturally was very discrete in both how I reacted to this film and how I sought it out. I can't watch the movie without yelling at the characters, and I'm always afraid that someone at the library will wonder what a male like me is doing renting a movie like that with the amount of times I do. So, what is the movie itself? Well, it's a women's late 1960s half melodrama/half 'life passing as we adventure and experience the world' drama. It's very well-acted but the material is at time's cringe-worthy. What really makes the film is just how effectively it emobdies its setting and attitudes of the characters. As for the former we really feel like we're in a mental hospital. This isn't raving lunatics and great horrors. It's a locked summer camp for sane young adults, who were bought down by the man. This is the type of place I would find myself lying on my couch imagining I was in. In terms of the latter, you could never accuse the film of not developing its characters, because one of the things it does amazingly masterpiece level way is make clear the way that all the characters view their lives and situations. We really understand why they all do what they do and feel what they feel as well why they are in the positions they are in. It's tragic and it sucks you into the story like few other films have by crafting a portrait of people who seem real, for they might as well be real people (whom they were based off) because our understanding of them is great. Even, though I can objectively say that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a better film, the characters don't have anything on this movie. This film has a lot that goes for it, but then again, it's just eaten up by me. There are so many ingredients for transcendent cinema here, and although I experience that because it is almost like a film made for me, I wouldn't know about that with other people. The thing is I couldn't possibly judge how a normal person would see this film. It's terribly manipulative and the ending is totally untrue. This is what they movies that are favorites but not best ofs. Actually, when I think of it, if it weren't for that untrue ending and manipulation, this could have been a experience I could truly consider to be great. The vibrancy of the characters had a ridiculous amount going for them, and I could only (and do in my spare time) imagine how great it really could have been had the characters stayed truer to their nature. I really should write a fanfiction.",10,0,3,21 April 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," A sequence of brilliance that clocks in under an hour surrounded by garbage
","I can understand why some love 2001 A Space Oddessy. It contains some of the best filmaking I've seen by Kubrick or any other director. It contains haunting and perfectly rendered sequences of science fiction beauty that is as great as any film called a masterpiece or anything done by Kubrick. Some may argue that it is the best work Kubrick has done. It's intense and captivating, and it's less than 1/3 of the running length. This is a structurally odd film. We are treated to a number of sequences that seem almost self-contained and then the film ends almost inexplicable with a scene of grace and beauty but only in a complete non-substantial sense. Basically, the majority of the film, which encapsulates on both ends the segment, is extremely pretty and amazingly conceived sequences of music and imagery without meaning or purpose that fail to captivate beyond their own visual and auditory beauty. There must have been some higher intention on the part of Kubrick and his writer here, but I think that it was just lazy filmaking on their part.Anyone with a knack for photography and arrangement can do what they did. It's incorporating that with a compelling something that makes movie-making on par with that beauty, and they do that, in the one sequence, while the remainder is simply a waste. Rent the movie and watch the whole thing, because it is worth experiencing, but I bet that there'll be only one part that really felt worthy of its craft.",5,6,11,3 June 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," I wouldn't call say it's my favorite film in the genre, but I would say it's a film fit to be a classic
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has a wonderful message, an amazing villain, and one of the most trouble-making protagonists in the most root-worthy of senses I have ever seen in moviedom. R.P. McMurphey is put in a mental hospital, where he must rebel against the evil establishment. A classic story of will versus the meanies. Essentially a tragicomedy, we get a film that works in both exposition and exploration of the mental hospital concept as it relates to the free-spirited protagonist, newly inserted as a patient, as well as the other patients, who are men, bought down by the wo'man'. This is the stuff classics are made out of, though I do not think it's the definitive piece in the asylum genre. The film really doesn't operate on the same level that a lot of other piefces in that genre, do, focusing more on on stuff more about the soul than the 'psyche'. I think that's what lends the film it's whole flavor, but if you be looking in the genre, this is satisfying in a different (more life-affirming way). I wouldn't call it a personal favorite, but I would call it superb work.It's also anti-psychiatry, like myself, and I gotta give it that. Comparing other mental hospital films to this is unfair, however. Besides the setting, I cannot recall a single mental hospital film out there with the guts to be like this film. This film totally is a different animal from something like say 'Girl, Interrupted' or 'The Snake Pit' or many other films which have bits like that. The film is about the affirmation of the human spirit against a seething institution. I'd say that this movie has more in common with prison movies.",9,0,1,23 April 2007
Jackie Brown," Ultimately, a bit boring, don't you think?
","This film has a great start and a very memorable opening sequence. Our main character is on an airport track and is going forward on a conveyor belt set to a great tune. Fantastic use of the camera and a great song to go along with it, but then once you get to the movie, beyond the stylized and interesting opening, the film starts to slow down and goes on for 2 1/2 it didn't need to.The thing that defines the film from Tarantino's other work is that is not his own creation (or his own ripoff of someone else's creation) but a legitimate adaption of a novel. Tarantino's style was never that conventional and when you see him working within conventional cofines, which is sort of what this is, despite being a vibrant-feeling piece, his whole style just doesn't work and he can't acomodate proper pacing. Tarantino's style is suited to fast-pased thrillers or just things told of out of sequence. When he tells a character-driven crime story in a rather linear matter, his very superfluous direction and writing ends up chugging the whole thing down, when it should be either speeding the thing up or directing more so its focus. The opening is more in line with his type of films, but once it gets into relationships and more complex elements of story and character, the thing just kind of drags.It's got so much good in it, with great acting and great dialouge, but Tarantino just doesn't pace it right cause he can't handle a story of this type and the movie ends up feeling a bit boring, by the time you're finished. Still, though, it's got so much good in it, that it's not necessarily a bad way to spend an afternoon but maybe there'll be a point, where you wish it were it over, when there's probably still a good amount to go.",6,35,60,14 March 2007
