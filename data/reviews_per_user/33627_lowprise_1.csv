Ford v Ferrari," another great racing film
","I had the same excitement going to view this film as I had in 1966 when I drove 90 miles to watch the movie Grand Prix. I would have liked to have seen more racing action. The sound was great, but my favorite racing movie is still Grand Prix.",8,2,3,16 November 2019
