Resident Evil: Afterlife," At least it's improved from the third...
","So after the third film I walked into the theatre at my friend's request with no expectations. It was an endless barrage of violence and it lacks the charm I've found in the games, but it has improved solidly from Extinction which made me wish I could have crawled in a hole and hid. Jovovich clearly lacks talent, either to act or choose roles and films I can't decide, she does well for the part though as a void feminine character to kick ass, because let's face it the movie does kick ass. The characters are clich√©d, but the effects are decent and the film does manage to keep you entertained if you shut your brain off and involves more than a bunch of crows and that awful Las Vegas attack scene of the third and Alice (FINALLY) loses those crazy powers that made the third film completely irritating to me. The only thing that bugs me about the franchise aside from that it WON'T die is that Resident Evil has so much potential to be a movie... eerie mansions, genetic mutations, the whole meticulously detailed past of the Umbrella Corporation, it's practically a formula for success... so keep trying Jovovich and crew... maybe you'll get it right someday.",4,10,21,12 September 2010
Inception," Best piece of 2010 thus far... not that it was hard....
","Honestly coming into Inception I didn't have a clue what it was about, but I knew it had to be good with Christopher Nolan directing and Leonardo DiCaprio starring (funnily enough I didn't care for him until I watched Shutter Island). Despite my assumption being based almost entirely on names the film did not disappoint! Inception is the definition of summer movie and Nolan created an intelligent film with an actual plot behind the orgy of special effects fuelled explosions (which there was plenty of). The storyline is very matrix-esquire and Nolan manages to weave a story with dreams within dreams and the whole concept of implanting an idea seamlessly. Although aside from DiCaprio's character many had no real personality, but the performance is mostly on DiCaprio in the end and he manages to succeed in creating a character still lost in his dreams pining over his love. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should definitely see it because its a wonderful blend of action adventure, science fiction themes, plot (!), and explosions.",10,6,13,14 September 2010
