The Rock," Entertaining Action Film
","'The Rock' is a solid and entertaining action film with characters intresting enogh to keep the film good. Sean Connery is one of the world's best action stars and he still plays it like a pro in this film. Nicolas Cage gives a humerous performance, and he and connery play off each other well to make a memorable team. Three stars.",10,1,1,3 January 2000
The Mask," A Great Comedy
","Out of all Jim Carrey's comedies this is definitely his funniest one. 'The Truman Show' is still his best film but this is his best comedy, he really gets to showcase his talent here, he is a very funny person. Also keep an eye out for an early Cameron Diaz, SMOKIN!!",9,0,0,15 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Terrific Entertainment
","'Star Wars':'Episode 1 The Phantom Menace' has more action in it than the rest of the 'Star Wars' trilogy combined. This is definitely an underrated film. Despite being in the middle of a lot of special effects the cast does good work here especially Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor. Personally I didn't mind Jar Jar Binks, he didn't bother me at all. I definitely reccomend this movie.",10,0,1,6 January 2000
Ghost," Hugely Entertaining
",'Ghost' is a drama/thriller that is hugely entertaining. Though 'Ghost' is a tear jerker aimed at a female audience I think that this movie can entertain males as well. This film plays like a mystery thriller which  really gives it an edge. The whole cast turns in very good performances (Especially Whoopi Goldberg who won an academy award for her performance here.),10,1,2,12 January 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Relentlessly Exciting Action-Adventure
",'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an relentlessly exciting action adventure movie. It opens with a great scene and it improves with every scene after that. Harrison Ford is perfect(as usual)as Indiana Jones and he makes this movie all the more better. Any action adventure fan will love this movie.,10,0,0,26 January 2000
Citizen Kane," What Can I Say ?
","What can I say about 'Citizen Kane' that hasn't already been said?  This is one of the best movies ever made, it has been voted that numerous times. I usually don't like classic movies but I really liked this one, anybody interested in film or movies should definitly see this picture it employs everything that is good in moviemaking, writing, acting, cinematography, editing, directing. This film is an absolute must see.",10,0,1,16 February 2000
Beauty and the Beast," Breathtaking
","'Beauty and the Beast' is a breathtaking movie, not just as an animated feature but as a movie. Along with 'The Lion King' this is the pinnacle of Disney animation. This film does however have a better story than 'The Lion King'. The single most breathtaking scene in this movie is the scene where Belle and the beast dance in the ballroom, your jaw will hit the floor. This is the only animated movie to get a Best Picture nomination and rightfully so.",9,1,1,11 March 2000
Batman Returns," A Very Good Sequel
","Though I still prefer the originial 'Batman' I still think that 'Batman Returns' is a very good sequel. It is darker and more violent than needs to be an that does hurt the film. What help the film is two supierior villans, 'The Penguin' and 'Catwoman'. Michele Pfieffer who plays 'Catwoman' is by far the sexiest villian ever!",7,0,0,21 March 2000
The Mummy," The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure
","'The Mummy' ranks as the ultimate guilty pleasure movie, it is not a great movie but it is entertaining and fun enough not to be bad. After the movie was over I almost felt bad for liking this movie. If your ever at the video store and your in the mood for something silly don't miss 'The Mummy'.",8,0,0,19 January 2000
Ed Wood," A Masterpiece
","Leave it to Tim Burton to make an exceptional film about a man who is considered to be the worst director of all time. This film features amazing performances from a terrific cast. Martin Landau and Johnny Depp turn in some of the most amazing performances I have ever seen. Landau won an academy award for his performance here, Johnny Depp wasn't even nominated!!! When he should have won. I highly reccomend this movie.",10,0,0,7 January 2000
Home Alone," Classic Comedy
","'Home Alone' is a very funny comedy that has become a timeless classic. This is the perfect family movie, it offers something to both adults and children. Macauly Culkin is perfect in his role as a kid who has been accidently left behind by his family. This is a very funny movie, I recommend it.",9,1,2,7 January 2000
The Terminator," A Sci-Fi Action Classic
","It's hard to believe it has been almost 16 years since this film came out, but it still looks good and still plays just as good today as it did in 1984. It has a very dark atmosphere and a moody score to compliment it. It has one of the most amazing climaxes in cinematic history. One of the best sci-fi movies ever, one of the best action movies ever. 'Terminator 2' is still a much better film though.",10,0,0,4 January 2000
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One Of The All Time Classics
","Out of all the classic films I have seen one of the ones I like the most is 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. Most classics to me are overrated and not as good as they are made out to be. This is a very entertaining film, never boring for a second and the two superb leading actors play off each other perfectly to create arguably the most memorable screen team in movie history.I definitely recommend this movie.",10,0,4,7 March 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant Film
",'Dr. Strangelove' is by far Stanley Kubrick's best film and is one of the best movies ever made. It has a knockout cast which delivers knockout performances. Peter Sellers gives three performances in this film all of them brilliant.Every second this movie was on I had a big grin on my face. A Brilliant film,10,1,1,3 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Great End To The Saga
","'Return of the Jedi' is a great end to the 'Star Wars' saga, while episode 2 and episode 3 haven't been made yet, this is still a great conclusion. It shows us what happens to all the characters. I have never been a big 'Star Wars' fan but this is a great movie.",9,0,0,11 February 2000
Blade II," Intense action and thrills
","'Blade 2' is a kick ass action thriller. It tops the original in every way. It is just as dark if not darker than the original, the action is more frequent and intense, the effects and acting are better also. I was expecting this to be a good film, it is and then it's more, this film gives us lots of everything, gore, blood, bullets,action and keeps it coming for 2 hours, there is almost too much action in this film. Wesley Snipes performance here is much better than that of the first film, in the first film he had this frustrated expression plastered on his face throughout the whole movie, here he has some comic moments and is much more expressive. The action is where this film really excels, the first film had lots of action and this film makes it look anemic, from the opening on, this film is loaded with action, I mean loaded. The weak spots in this film revolve around the plot, but they are few and far between. 'Blade 2' is easily the best action film to hit theaters all year. The complaints I have are far and few between, some of the effects look cheesy, and the final fight scene is a little too outrageous, other than that, this film hits the bullseye",8,0,3,17 April 2002
Malcolm X," Spike Lee's Finest film
","I consider 'Malcom X' to be Spike Lee's finest film, better than 'Do the Right Thing'. Denzel Washington gives the performance of the decade in the title role of 'Malcom X'. This film is 3 hours and 21 minutes long and it is never boring for a second and is always entertaining. This film tells the entire story of Malcom X, from a street thug to an civil rights activist. Spike Lee makes films about race relations in america, and I feel that he really got his point across with this film. This is a powerhouse film not to be missed.",10,3,10,14 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is strong with this one
","Wow! 'Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones' lives up to all of the hype and then some. This film improves on 1999's 'The Phantom Menace' in the character and story department, though the acting is still a little flat. I was impressed with the performance of Hayden Christensen portraying Anakin Skywalker, we can see shades of the dark side in him. I was also pleased to see that Samuel L. Jackson was given more screen time, we still don't find out much about his character, Mace Windu, but it nice too see him have some significant screen time. This film explains more about the Star Wars  story than the last film did, the action in this film is phenomenal, there is a flying car chase which is breathtaking. The last 45 minutes of this film are the true standout, it is non stop action, the real highlight of the action and the film is when Yoda picks up a lightsaber and shows us why he is the Jedi master, it is truly awesome. I highly recommend this film, a trluy good movie and one that I hope will be remembered at the years end",9,0,1,22 May 2002
Predator," A Solid Action-Suspense Thriller
","'Predator' is a solid action suspense thriller, I recently  rented this movie and I had forgotten what a good movie this was. There is more suspense than action in this movie but it is still a good movie, this ranks as one of Schwarzenegger's best films. Any action fan will like this movie.",10,1,2,27 February 2000
American Pie," A Suprisingly Funny Comedy
","'American Pie' could have been a lot of things it could have been a mean spirited comedy or a pointless gross-out picture but it is neither. It manages to be funny with out being insulting. I didn't want to see this movie when it came out but now I am glad I did. For anybody who likes comedy this film is a must. Also, Mena Suvari is a babe!!",8,0,0,2 February 2000
U-571," An Exciting, Edge of Your Seat Adventure
","'U-571' is an exciting edge of your seat adventure. It builds and maintains tension throughout the movie. The direction and performances are top notch. I didn't think I was going to like this movie but it maintained my interest throughout, I recommend this film.",9,1,4,14 May 2000
American Beauty," A Powerful and Mezmerizing Film
",After hearing countless praises for 'American Beauty' I was expecting a hell of a picture and I was not dissapointed. Out of all the films I have seen very few have emersed me like this one. Instead of watching actors I felt like I was watching a real person's life unfold right in front of me. I truly hope that this movie wins Best Picture it deserves it.,10,0,0,27 February 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Best Movie Of All Time
","Terminator 2 is the best film I have ever seen hands down. It surpasses the original in almost every way except the first film had a darker moodier atmosphere. But Terminator 2 has much much more, more character development, better acting strong direction, and THE most amazing visual effects ever!!! Cameron's and Schwarzenegger's best movie. A true classic. The Best!!!",10,364,526,26 November 1999
Apocalypse Now," My candidate for the most overrated movie of all time
","'Apocalypse Now' in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all time. It is not a bad movie but it is not a great one either. I kept waiting for this film to climax, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. I liked a few of the attack sequences and the cinematography but other than that, nothing. I just don't get what is so great about this film.",7,0,3,8 November 2000
The Patriot," Great Movie
","'The Patriot' was one of my favorite movies from the year 2000. I think this is a great film, better than Gibson's 'Braveheart'. I don't understand peoples critisizms of it's historical inaccuracies, who cares ?! Gibson gives his best performance yet in this movie, the rest of the cast does well also, the battle scnes are spectacular, despite being 2 hours and 44 minutes long 'The Patriot' is never boring. See this film.",10,0,1,22 February 2001
Face_Off," I forgot how much I love this movie
","It had been a while since I had seen 'Face/Off' last. I just watched the film again and I remembered how much I love this movie. 'Face/Off' which after three years still remains a cinematically dazzling action movie. The best part of this movie is the human story, most action movies blow things up for 2 hours and call it a day, but 'Face/Off' focuses in on the characters lives. That is what really makes this movie what it is. John Woo remains the world's reigning action director. This is one of the best action films ever released in mainstream Hollywood.",10,3,4,15 October 2000
Face_Off," A Wild Ride
","'Face/Off' ranks as one of the very best action movies ever and was one of the best films of 1997. The cast does superb work especailly the two leads, Travolta and Cage. The main reason this film is so good is that it has the worlds best action director behind it: John Woo, the action scenes in this film will leave you breathless. And it's even better on DVD. Hugely reccomended.",10,1,2,12 January 2000
Aliens," Amazing Film
","'Aliens' is an amazing film, it has some of the most tense suspense and action scenes ever. Once the movie starts it never lets up. The entire cast gives solid performances and as usual James Cameron does an amazing job of directing. This is the best film in the Alien' series by far and one of the best science fiction films ever.",10,1,2,4 January 2000
Die Hard 2," The Best Of The Trilogy
","'Die Hard 2' is vastly superior to the first 'Die Hard' movie. This film has much more action than the first film and is better directed. The action scenes are fast paced and clever. This is one of Bruce Willis' best movies, if they decide to do a 'Die Hard 4' I can only hope that they get Renny Harlin to direct it.",Null,0,2,25 January 2000
Independence Day," Entertaining But Thin
","'Independence Day' is definitly an entertaining movie but it has so many holes in the story that in the end it could have been even better. The visual effects are extremely well done and very convincing. The film is escapist entertainment, you are thoroughly enjoyed while watching it but the second you walk out of the theatre you forget all about it, a gulity pleasure movie.",7,5,11,1 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Staggering
","'Staggering' is the only word to describe 'Saving Private Ryan', watching this film is a truly powerful experience, you will remember this movie long after it is over. The battle scenes in this movie are unparalelled in cinematic history, they show the true horrors of what soldiers in World War 2 went through. the performances are excellent, Tom Hanks gives his best performance yet as Captain John H. Miller the leader of the platoon to find Private James Ryan who gets to go home because his other brothers were killed in combat. A truly unforgetable experience. Don't miss it.",10,0,1,13 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Truly Magical
","Very few films have captivated me like this film, it took me out of the theater and into a different world. I didn't care that the movie had subtitles after a while I didn't even notice. The action scenes in this movie are unlike anything you have seen before. The direction from Ang Lee is brilliant. I hope that this movie wins Best Picture. Great film, I can't recocomend it more highly.",9,0,0,20 February 2001
JFK," Absolutely Riveting, I couldn't take my eyes off it
","'JFK' is a riveting film, I was totally engrossed in the whole movie from begining to end. This film raises questions about the Kennnedy assassination and it really makes you wonder whether there was a conspiracy to kill him. The editing in this movie is absolutely phenomenal it almost looks like a documentary. Director Oliver Stone is a master at making riveting and thought provoking films and this is no exception. Behind 'Platoon' this is his best movie. I highly reccomend this movie to everyone.",10,3,15,21 March 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Better than the original
","'Mission Impossible 2' is better than the first film, but that isn't saying much. 'MI:2' is certainly iffy in parts but as a whole I feel that it is a better film than the first one. My biggest problem with this movie is that the characters keep changing faces too quickly and easily(You will have to see the film to know what I am talking about). The main reason that this film is better is the director, John Woo, nobody on the planet directs action like this man, nobody. Though compared to his Hong Kong efforts this movie is very watered down. But overall I recommend 'Mission Impossible 2'.",8,1,2,21 July 2000
A Bug's Life," A Film For All Ages
","As I said with 'The Lion King', this is another movie that anyone any age can enjoy. The computer animation in this film is amazing truly show stopping. Pixar animation studios who made 'Toy Story' have topped themselves here, this actually better than 'Toy Story'.  With a great vocal cast that includes Kevin Spacey, Dave Foley, and many others.",10,0,0,16 February 2000
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Weak Sequel
","'Home Alone 2' clones virtually every aspect of the original,without adding anything new or funny. The plot is basically the same except this time the movie takes place in New York and not in a house. Macaulay Culkin gives a decent performance but he can't save this movie. I suggest that anyone who wants to see this that they go rent the original, you will be much more entertained.",2,11,26,1 February 2000
The Hurricane," A Knockout
","I just saw the new film 'The Hurricane' and I was very impressed with it. Denzel Washington gives an incredible Oscar-Caliber performance. Behind 'Raging Bull' this is the best boxing film, though niether film are truly about boxing they both explore the characters life outside the ring. I highly reccomend this film.",10,3,5,6 February 2000
Pretty Woman," A Warm Hearted Romantic Comedy
","I really liked 'Pretty Woman', I understand why this movie has become a classic. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts have never been better than they were here. I am not a big fan of romantic comedies but I really liked this one. It is a modern day 'Cinderella' story, highly reccomended.",8,0,0,8 February 2000
Pulp Fiction," A Very Unique Film Masterpiece
","'Pulp Fiction' is a very unique masterpiece,there has never been a movie like it before and there will never be another film like this. This film changed hollywood movie making forever by being original and audatious. The entire cast of this fiolm gives knockout performances especially Samuel L. Jackson, who helps deliver some outstanding dialouge.",10,0,0,4 January 2000
Titanic," Very Entertaining
",Though 'Titanic' didn't deserve to win best picture it is still a very well done movie that will entertain anyone who watches it. The visual effects in this film are astounding and absolutely beleivable. Alot of people say this film is overrated but I dissagree. Like I said not the best film ever but entertaining anyways. James Cameron is a masterful director and I hope he announces his next movie soon. 'Terminator 2' still ranks as his best film though.,10,2,5,20 January 2000
Die Hard," The most influential action movie of all time, though not the best
","'Die Hard' is without a doubt the most influential action movie of all time, it's plot has served as the blueprint for a hundred other action movies. But I disagree with people calling it 'The best action movie of all time'. Everybody is entitled to their opinion and I respect that. My major complaint about this movie is that there are too many pointless characters, The F.B.I. agents, the police chief, and Ellis add nothing to the story and they make the film very annoying. All in all though this is a good film.",7,0,2,5 July 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The Second Best Of The Trilogy
","Behind 'Die Hard 2' this is the best film in the trilogy. Samuel L. Jackson as always is great, Jeremy Irons creates a memorable villan and the film is well directed by John McTeirnan. The best aspect of this installment is that the film has a lot of plot twists the keep you guessing, you think you know what's going to happen but then it goes in the opposite direction, a very good sequel.",8,0,0,30 March 2000
Con Air," Bring Aspirin
",Before you sit down to watch the god awful 'Con Air' have some aspirin handy. This movie will give you a splitting headache. This film is an insult to action movies and action movie fans everywhere. A truly terrific cast can't show there talent here because there is no script for them to work with. The only people who deserve credit for doing anything good in this movie are the casting directors who put together an terrific cast.,1,4,12,3 January 2000
The Lion King," A Film For All Ages
","This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout.",10,339,391,20 January 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," An Uplifting Movie About Hope
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is an uplifting movie about hope. What I got out of the movie is that as long as you have hope you will always be O.K., I felt good after watching this movie, it puts that sense of hope inside you. I was actually cheering during the scene where Andy finally escaped from prison,it was a very unique moment. This is a film that anybody can watch and anybody that does watch it it will touch them in a special way, I guarantee it.",9,0,0,28 March 2000
Platoon," A Flat Masterpiece
","'Platoon' is a powerful and truthful film that shows that war is really hell. It unblinkingly shows us all of the heartache, horrors, and pain of war. Ever since 'Saving Private Ryan' was released 'Platoon' has been somewhat overlooked by people. This should be in the top 20 on the top 250 movies list. A Masterpiece.",10,1,1,4 January 2000
Raging Bull," One Of The Best Movies Ever
","'Raging Bull' is one of the best movies ever made, everything about the movie is amazing, Robert DeNiro's performance, Martin Scorsese's direction, score, editing, everything. This is a very powerful film and an unforgettable one also. This film deserves to be on every 'Best Movies Of All Time' list. Amazing.",10,1,2,4 January 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," A Top Notch Thriller
",'The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the best and creepiest thrillers I have ever seen. Great actors like Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster turn magnificent award winning performances. The suspense in this film is almost to intense you will be on the edge of your seat. I highly reccomend this movie it is a top notch thriller.,10,1,1,9 February 2000
Any Given Sunday," Plays better on video than it did in theaters
","I saw 'Any Given Sunday' last christmas when it came out, when I left the theater I had a splitting headache. I thought that the film was too loud and that the editing was too fast. I recently bought the film on DVD and it is much easier to watch everything doesn't seem so loud. Oliver Stone I felt, did a good job with this film, he got good performances from Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, and Al Pacino. I wish Stone would make his movies in a straightforward way, his hyperactive use of editing gets old. I also felt that this film was too long, but there is so much going on in this movie that you won't notice. All in all I recommend this movie.",8,0,0,27 October 2000
The Deer Hunter," An Emotionally Shattering Experience ***Spoiler Alert***
","'The Deer Hunter' has to be one of the most powerful films ever. It is certainly one of the most powerful films I have seen. While this movie is looked upon as a war movie I think it is much more than that, I think it is a character study of how war affects people, not just the people involved in the war but their families also. There are moments in this film that I will never forget, like the absolutely terrifying russian roulette scene, if you think about the situation the characters are in it is very terrifying. An emotionally shattering experience.",10,0,0,13 April 2000
Speed," Hold On Tight!!!
","'Speed' is a fast-paced,thrilling,wild ride of a movie that's a must see!! 'Speed' doesn't insult your intelligence like a lot of action movies today do. It is a very clever thriller that never stops until the movie ends. 'Speed' ranks as one of the very best action films ever, I highly reccomend it.",10,0,0,7 January 2000
The Truman Show," Brilliant
","The only word to describe 'The Truman Show' is brilliant. It is very original, inventive, and very entertaining. This is one of the very best films of 1998 and yet it was not even nominated for Best Picture. This is by far Jim Carrey's best movie and it was a real shame that he did not get nominated. I highly recomend this film.",9,0,0,23 March 2000
Heat," A Great Crime Thriller
","'Heat' is a great crime thriller that builds and builds to a great climax. When you have a director like Michael Mann, actors like Robert Deniro and Al Pacino the result is going to be spectacular, and it is. The shootout scene in this movie is one of the best in cinematic history. This film also has a great supporting cast as well including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore. This is an excellent film.",Null,0,0,9 February 2000
Thirteen Days," Exciting, Gripping movie
","'Thirteen Days' is a great film. It is powerful, gripping and it keeps your interest for 2 and a half hours. Kevin Costner hasn't been in a movie this good since 'JFK', the performances are excellent. I feel that this is one of the best films of 2000 and it's a shame that it didn't get more recognition than it did, it is a great film. Don't miss this film.",9,0,0,20 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One Of The Best Sequels Ever
","'The Empire Strikes Back' is a stronger film than 'Star Wars'. The characters are stronger and more established and it is better made. This film is arguably the best sequel of all time, it expands on the original rather than remaking it. This is the best film out of all the 'Star Wars' films though I really liked 'Episode 1'. A must see film.",9,0,0,22 March 2000
Windtalkers," Despite Weaknesses still a well done film
","'Windtalkers' has it's share of problems: It doesn't bother to tell us more on the subject on which the story is based: The Navajo indian codetalkers who were a vital point for victory for the US in WW 2. Also the performance for lead Nicolas Cage was very subdued, and finally there are a few predictable cliches in this film. Most of the film is good, the battle scenes of which there are 5, are intensly shot and edited, and Director John Woo shows considerable skill while directing the action, it is obvious that drama is not Woo's field, but this film is a step in the right direction. This film could have been beter, but the decent acting and intense battle scenes make up for the slow parts. The performance byu  co-star Adam Beach is more than a worthwile pefromance, he shows some serious acting chops here, I hope to see more of him in the future",8,1,1,14 June 2002
Gladiator," Did I mis something here ?
","Why is this movie so popular ? I am suprised at the enormous success of this movie. I was dissaponted by 'Gladiator', it is not a bad film but I didn't really like it. I feel like I am alone in saying that I didn't like 'Gladiator', everyone else seems to like it. There are a few good things about this movie, Russel Crowe's performance is good and I liked the look of the film. My biggest complaint about this movie is that I kept waiting for something to happen that never did.",6,0,0,8 November 2000
Born on the Fourth of July," One of Stone's most powerful films
","'Born on the Fourth of July' is Oliver Stones most powerful film behind 'Platoon'. People have critisized this film and Oliver Stone for taking too many liberties, none of the the critisisms have any relevance. Unless you are Ron Kovic upon who the story is based you have no right to complain. This is a great movie and Oliver Stone is a great director, period. Tom Cruise gives his best performance to date here as vietnam vet Ron Kovic, who, after fighting in Vietnam is confined to a wheelchair. In fact all the acting in this movie is phenomenal. Behind 'Platoon', 'JFK', and 'Natural Born Killers' this is Stone's best film. I have the upmost respect for people brave enough to fight in the Vietnam war, I hope I don't upset anyone with my comments.",9,12,19,10 November 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," More Action
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' has more action than the other movies in the trilogy. The stunts in this movie are even better than the stunts in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' which is saying a lot. The best thing about this sequel is the addition of Sean Connery he adds humor in all the right places, any action fan will absolutley love this movie.",9,0,0,10 February 2000
Goodfellas," One of my favorites
","'GoodFellas' is one of my favorite films, I have seen this movie countless times and it gets better each time. Martin Scorsese is arguably the best director working in films today and yet he has been ignored by the Oscars countless times. Scorsese was at the top of his craft when he made this film, and it shows. The cast in this movie is amazing. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco all turn in top notch performances. Movies don't get much better than this. Don't miss it.",10,0,0,10 May 2000
Goodfellas," The Second Best Film Of The 90's
","Behind 'Terminator 2:Judgement Day' 'GoodFellas' is the best film of the 1990's. This film shows us the nitty gritty about life in the mafia, It also features great performances from the entire cast, particularly Ray liotta who gives the movie's best performance. Then there's Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Robert Deniro who all turn in great performances. This film is a masterpiece. Much, Much better than 'The Godfather'.",10,0,4,3 January 2000
