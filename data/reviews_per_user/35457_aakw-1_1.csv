Ali," Will Smith did an excellent job....
","Will Smith has done justice with the roll, being 'Muhammad Ali' I do not think is/was an easy job at all. And the Justice done in United States by Supreme Court was a legendary decision of real human liberty at 'Muhammad Ali' time. Two thumbs up to both Ali and US Supreme Court.The movie start is gripping enough and the entry of Malcolm X is great, the movie portrays the history, and is done an awesome production. Ali was and is still a loving personality, his achievements and work for humanity as a noble man is great.May God give him health. Will Smith always is one of the wonderful person since 'Fresh Prince of Bellair' a proved 100% understanding holder about what ever the roll he is in does the justice always. God may give him more success and we can see him in more excellent movie productions.",Null,0,0,10 October 2004
