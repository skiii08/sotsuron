The Expendables 2," Worst movie I ever seen, how did all those great actors agree to be in this creepy movie
","I Have no idea why all those great actors agree to be in this 'Worst movie aver made'. Money? is this why they agree? The directing was absolutely beginner worst luck. To bad they spent quite a bit of money in this movie. Special effects were short and with little effect. The passing of the camera from one actor to another has bad. The editor was a beginner. Who ever spent their money in the making of this film supposed to ask for more from this movie. The previews review was commercial not accurate at all. I can't believe it got 7 Stars, probably out of respect for the great actors, not for what this movie is made. Wasted couple of hours for nothing, I will not get them back. Sorry for my English, but I had to tell the future audience what to expect from this movie. I will not spoil your experience if you still decided to watch this movie.",1,2,4,26 December 2012
