Source Code," Excellent movie,top 10!
","Well i was sceptical when I first watched the trailer, after a weird start and some focusing. I realized, whoa this is genius. Good actors, good scenes, good story. I simply love this movie for it's creativity. I don't want to spoil anything in the review. But if you liked Inception and other similar films you will love this one.It is deep,it will make you think you should not fall asleeep during this one. Only negative, it was too short in my opinion. This one could have so much potential.I just wanted to put out the word, if you have not seen this movie.I recommend you to watch it as soon as possible!",10,2,3,16 June 2011
