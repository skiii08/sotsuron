Alien 3," The sequel that should never have been made!
","This film is perhaps the worst 'A' movie made in this genre. I say 'A' movie to distinguish it from poorly done 'B' movies where you don't expect much in the first place. It would have been bad just because the camera work showing the alien was so poor. But the real crime is that, by answering the question of what happened to the android and little girl Ripley saved in Alien 2, and given what happens to Ripley in this movie, you feel like your investment in the series and in the characters was a complete waste of time and emotion. Thus this movie not only ruined itself but the entire series!Do NOT see this film!",1,394,414,8 April 2001
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Along with Unforgiven, possibly the best western of all time
","This movie is too often thought of as a western comedy or perhaps a 'buddy film'. While it is both, it is so much more. It is the story of how the last of the 19th century individualists became hopelessly out of place as organized civilization spread through the United States. The outlaws turn away from bank robbing because they are now nearly impregnable. They are chased after by the 'Super Posse' which is made up of individuals from many states, working together and aided by the very railroads the heroes are robbing. When they finally die, it is because even in Bolivia long-distance communication (I think it was telegraph in the movie) allowed the army to quickly get to the scene. The key moment in the movie is when they are told (not a direct quote), 'Your time is through. The only thing now is to find the time and place of your dying.'My only complaint is that Director George Roy Hill took out a key scene after only a few weeks in the theaters. I was lucky enough to see it before it was cut and it made the movie even more powerful, even if it did, as Hill said, slow it down somewhat. The missing scene is found in the screenplay, which was published into a book.",10,0,3,17 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Excellent film true to the book(s)
","I first read the book when I was 15, late in the year 1965. I was not a good selection to comment on it, since I wasn't a fan of fantasy and found most poetry put me to sleep, Still, I feel in love with the series, especially the rather lengthy ending in the final book's back, dealing what happened to the various people after the move ended.Rather than go over every scene one-by-1, let me summarize by saying that every character, landscape, and everything was the way I had imagined it but better. Casting was impeccable, and it appeared an inspired choice for South New Zealand.If the remaining two installments keep to the or better quality, this trilogy will rank up there with Titanic and T2. My only concern is that the rating could allow children in to watch what is both a violent, scary and philosophically complex movie.I do hope that Movie 3 will include the information in 'Return of the King' that tell movie-goers what happened to their favorite characters after the movie is finished, with the time fast-approaching for the departure for races and individuals to take a radically different (post-Ring) world to emerge.Edward D.

The Thing," A more faithful and suspense-filled version of the short story
","I never liked the first version of 'The Thing.' It didn't follow the short story (which a great many science fiction fans believe is the best SF short story ever written). The monster's makeup was awful, as was typical for a 1950's horror film, and the characterizations were stereotypical. The John Carpenter version fixes all of these problems. With the exception of the ending, it is very close to the original story. The special effects are excellent, and the characterizations (or at least the fear they exhibit) seemed realistic to me. The only flaw was the ending, which IMHO made no sense whatever. Happily, one can still enjoy the movie even with the ending. I've watched it several times and still find it a good flick.",9,0,1,8 April 2001
Armageddon," Exciting despite major flaws
","I have to admit a strong prejudice against science fiction films that are so scientifically inaccurate and unbelievable that they are embarrassing to those of us who actually like SF. (Note: Star Wars isn't science fiction, it's fantasy, which doesn't have to follow rules). If I were Joseph P. Allen, the NASA consultant, I would die of shame. If you can't spot most or all of the flaws, then you probably don't care.Besides the above, most of the characters were so forgettable that when they died you couldn't remember what they looked like! Many of the scenes on the asteroid looked like what they were: indoor sets under harsh lighting. I could go on but you get the picture. Brainless mind pap.I must admit that despite everything I still enjoyed watching it (!) because of the off-the-top performances and some (but definitely not all) of the special effects. Nevertheless, my judgement is that while adolescents may like Armageddon, the best film of this type is Deep Impact, released the same summer.",7,0,1,14 December 2002
Dark City," Finally a movie as good as 'Bladerunner' and 'The Matrix'
","Others both within IMDB and in external reviews have done a better job than I ever could in commenting on this film. I would only add a few things I liked and didn't like, and something important I thought the film left out.Positive: the incredible production design and art direction, which I thought reminiscent of Tim Burton's vision of Gotham City in the original 'Batman'; the original concept similarly and virtually simultaneously addressed by 'The Matrix;' and the understated acting that didn't get in the way (with one exception, noted below).Negative: whoever was responsible (Director Alex Proyas, probably) for the acting mannerisms used by Kiefer Sutherland (an actor I liked in the excellent TV drama '24') obviously needs some time in solitary confinement so he can rethink his decision. Sutherland's character alone got in the way of the script and broke through my Willing Suspension of Disbelief; he was an over-the-top cross between our image of Dr. Mengele and the spectacled Nazi in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. I also thought the final duel between the hero and villain could have had 30-45 seconds cut out to better effect.Summary: a combination of the film noir exhibited by 'Bladerunner' and much of the plot of 'The Matrix,' I give it a 9. It would have earned a 10 from me had Sutherland's acting been less affected and obtrusive.A Major Issue Not Addressed: The film was an effort to answer the question, 'Do Memories Make The Person?' It left us with a different question most of us already believe we know the answer to, which is, slightly reworded, 'Power Corrupts, but does Absolute Power Always Corrupt Absolutely?' Can a good person with good intentions surmount 'The Dark Side' inherent within all of our ID's? Perhaps the end of 'Dark City' could have been similar to the one in 'Sphere' had it only appeared first.",9,0,2,19 June 2002
28 Days Later...," Excellent end-of-the-world scenario with a flawed ending
","Although the plot is very unoriginal, I especially liked this version of the story because of the leisurely pace that sets the mood without letting you get bored. The Director didn't mind relatively long sequences without dialog when it was called for; I'm not sure a Hollywood-made film (this one was made in the U.K. by a U.K. company) would have been willing to do this. Ever since Star Wars the reigning action-movie concept in Hollywood seems to be action every 7 minutes max.I also liked the cinematography. There were great shots (extremely wide, taken from an unusual angle, etc.) that were unorthodox and in another film would have gotten in the way, but here they helped set the mood of a few people isolated in a huge city.I imagine it would be an even better experience in the theater, where the larger format and viewer being in the dark would have enhanced the feeling of isolation.**** SPOILER *** The one flaw is the ending, and unfortunately it is a bid problem. In the penultimate scene, the male protagonist (Jim) is shot in the stomach. Now, even in a modern big city, stomach wounds are very often fatal, and virtually always so without prompt surgery. Not only will the victim bleed to death, but even if the bleeding can somehow be stopped, peritonitis will almost always set in. Nevertheless, without anyone having more than a pharmacist's knowledge of medicine, with no surgical tools, and after a car ride where he would certainly have bled out, Jim survives. The last scene shows him hale and hearty, running over a meadow. I suppose there could be some explanation, but none was given, and it broke me out of my 'willing suspension of disbelief.'Nevertheless, I give the film a '9'. Definitely worth watching and re-watching.",9,21,36,6 March 2005
