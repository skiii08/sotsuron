The Avengers," Hype
","All of these Marvel movies are overrated and overhyped, probably because people can't bare their reality or watching reality-based movies that fantasy is driving their lives. It took me 3 sittings to finish this movie.",5,1,4,8 April 2019
Zodiac," Fav Serial Killer Movie
","This has to be my favorite serial killer movie. An excellent execution of setting and mood, building up fear and anxiety. I've watched it many times. I must admit, it might be a little boring at times but it's a good boring that keeps you focused instead of losing focus. Good cast as well, even the young and old Michael Mageau was a good casting job.",10,3,4,20 June 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Next!
",I keep trying to finish this movie but it just does not interest me enough. It's like a blah movie that maybe if it stormed and nothing else worked you could finish it.,3,0,1,26 August 2018
"Girl, Interrupted"," Unbearable
","I don't even know if the rest of the movie is good. The first 30 + minutes were unbearable and I just refuse to waste time watching another entire movie that isn't worth it. It's boring as heck, from scene to scene. They tried to have Jolie acting crazy to liven it up and it didn't work. The jumping flashbacks and flashforwards are nerve wrecking.",2,0,6,6 November 2019
Taken," The Line
","The line is pretty much as powerful as the 1st Saw when Jigsaw rose at the end. I'm usually not big on action movies, specifically car chases, but there are always exceptions. Taken is one of those. Liam Neeson played that role.",9,0,0,14 April 2019
The Untouchables," Overrated
","This movie was laughable. Very overrated and I felt left out having not watched it. Shoulda kept not watching it. Acting was horrible through and through. It was more like a comedy and I wasn't amused. De Niro played a weak Capone, Costner very unconvincing Ness with his weak voice. Plus, Capone was chubby so bad casting.",4,2,12,20 December 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Wake me up when it's over
",This movie is so boring. I can't believe I was able to watch more than half of it.,2,6,16,26 August 2018
