Hereditary," I'm not scarred for life like most people say, but yeah, it's pretty good.
","Intentionally slow paced to set creepy and suspenseful mood. I was never actually scared in this film and the only sleep I'll lose was the first night trying to understand it, which I successfully did and it has a very interesting story. I definitely need to revisit it and so should everyone just to pick up things I may have missed, however I'm not lookin go forward to sitting through that slow burn pacing a second time now that I know where it goes. Good movie, not as great as you hear about.",6,0,0,5 June 2020
Kung Fu Panda," The first movie I ever saw in theaters.
","This was my very first movie back in 2008 when little five year old me thought pandas were the coolest thing in the world. I was too young to see through that to find a genius story, truly intriguing characters, honestly timeless comedy and the sendoff of one of the greatest trilogies of all time, not just for children but for everyone, all of which this movie has to affect. this sparked my love of movies. Now I go to the movies twice a week and I love it so much. Please watch this, you won't regret it.",9,0,0,3 January 2020
Justice League," Main Manz film review
","Okay, it's not THAT bad. I can understand high expectations from a freaking justice league movie. But I went in late and I'd heard all the bad reviews and I went in with expectations based on previous entries in the DCEU. I found pros and cons:PROS-
-Superman is awesome for the time he's there.
-Barry Allen
-pretty cool to see them all share the screen.CONS-
-Cyborg is very underdeveloped
-Steppinwolfe kinda sucks (I don't care enough to look up his name so it may be spelled wrong.)
-I didn't understand the stakes. Like I saw no reason for them to come together other than to make a movie.",6,1,1,12 January 2020
