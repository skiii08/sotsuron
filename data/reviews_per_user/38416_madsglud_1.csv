Blade Runner 2049," What a wonderfully thrilling movie (or so it seemed)
","This movie is honestly well made. There is focus on every little detail and more. It is both thrilling, scary (just a bit) and consuming. It really gets you caught up in thah univers of theirs. Everything seemed to work out for this movie - except the end.
Anyways... It's definitely a movie worth watching.",8,2,10,29 July 2018
