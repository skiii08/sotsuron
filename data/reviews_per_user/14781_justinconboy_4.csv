3:10 to Yuma," Ben Foster is a legend already
","This movie is close to a perfect movie. The only problem I have with it is the slow pace at the start. Figuring out the Bales character is a coward!! OK! we got it, stop repeating it, move on! But after that it just becomes a brilliant story told really really well. I loved the set the scenery, the proper gun fights, the real sense of wild wild west. I like the way the two Big guns of Bale and Crowe work so well with each other to bring out the best in each others characters. I think Bale just held back a bit at the start!!! My favorite character was Charlie Prince played by Ben Foster. This is the second time I've seen him acting. First time was in Alpha Dog. He was brilliant in Alpha Dog and is even better in this movie. Brilliant casting; in this movie. Ben Foster is going to be the next big thing! Maybe he is already!! I don't know!! But he deserves to be. Maybe they could have made the shoot out scene a bit more realistic at the end; it can't be that easy to dodge 2000 bullets!!!",10,1,3,1 October 2007
Juno," Very, very, upset with this rubbish... 2/10
","This is a terrible movie. Napoleon Dynamite is better and even that sucked. So some quirky 16 year old is supposed to be this normal/abnormal! It's a load of rubbish. I walked out after 1 hour of torture. I don't know how it ends. I don't want to know how it end. I just think that like 'No Country for Old Men' and 'Sweeney Todd', this movie just doesn't live up to the hype that it is supposed too. I've always been berated for being an Oscars fan, because I liked the movies that make it to the final 5 and I usual aggree with the winner; but this year all the Oscar hatters have become Oscar lovers, because the movies they like are in the final 5 I'm just praying that 'There will be Blood' is as good as they say (Haven't seen it as it's released in Ireland yet). If one of the other movies win the Oscar; I'll go insane. This movie Juno is NOT funny, if you laugh at it, you are just laughing a some 16 year old girl actor reading from a scrip; which is not even believable for any age group. I only get upset with movies when people get sucked in by the hype. If you like Indy movies then just get Napoleon Dynamite out again instead; at least when he goes head over heals on his bike, that's funny! Answering a 'burger phone', 'No this is Morgan Freeman' is not funny. This is the second movie I've ever walked out of. It's supposed to be a comedy. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a comedy. 2/10 for the popcorn and coke and the 'Burger' I had before it. I'm so f**cking sick of stupid people and sh*t movies. Top 150, my ass.",1,110,248,14 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Brilliant Movie, but songs just not good enough, unlike Oliver Twist
","I loved the visual aspect of this movie. I thought the casting and acting was perfect. This is truly a perfect movie but only deserves 7 out of 10 because the songs are just not good enough. If we look at all the really big musical movies, Oliver Twist, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and so on and so on, there are always one or two songs that you'd remember from those films. With Sweeney Todd, there is no memorable song at all, not even a melody to hum on your way home. There is also only one scene where the actual musical moves out of the reality of the situation; what I mean by this is that the character Sweeney Todd actually sings in the street with the street patrons not taking any notice of him, a scene of disbelief within disbelief. This is a trait which has worked in many a musical movie and which actually doesn't work here at all as it's a lone scene of this type of singing on the street. This, you'll notice, happens a lot in Oliver Twist and with 60 years between these movies, Oliver Twist is a far more superior movie than 'Sweeney Todd'.",7,0,3,29 January 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Supprisingly Funny.
","I really enjoyed this movie. Dry wit, and some good one-liners. Simple but fun. The music was very good too which helped move the movie along without the felling of a dry patch in the running of the film. Happy day, I'd recommend it to anyone... but don't get me wrong, it's not Wedding Crashers or old school. I'm a bit glade Will Farrell didn't get this roll.. he would have been the obvious title role choice but it's good to see John C getting a lead in a comedy. He is good in this roll; he helps sets you up from the start, to come along for this dry humour laugh and a half. I always judge a movie by weather I'd go back and watch it again or when it comes out on TV, (this is especially true for comedies) this is one movie that I'd have no problem watching at least two or three times before I'd get sick of it.",7,0,0,29 January 2008
