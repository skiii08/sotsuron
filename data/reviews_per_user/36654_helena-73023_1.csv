Marie Antoinette," Silliness
","It's definitely geared toward a 14 year-old mind. Not at all inviting, let alone remotely interesting based on...mere silliness. If you are looking for something that reveals what 1700's France was like through a film, Look elsewhere. The costumes are Hunger Games meets Valmont with a 1980's slang dialogue AND an 80's musical score to match. About 3 historical facts in this film are accurate and the balance is fluff made up by who knows...Sophia Coppola is an idiot, always has been, confirmed by New York Stories back in the day and this takes the Marie Antoinette Cake...literally.",2,0,0,4 January 2018
