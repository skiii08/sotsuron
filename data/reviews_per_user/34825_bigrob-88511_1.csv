Hereditary," Unnerving, Horrifying, and Impactful
","Hereditary is a masterful horror movie. It uses subtilty in a sinister way and hits hard when it needs to. Reminiscent of horror films of old such as The Shining, you won't see a lot of jump scares or spooks here. If you are looking for something to 'scare' you, this may not be the right fit. Heredity does something else - perhaps something more. This movie hits emotionally and psychologically and truly horrifies and torments you. It is painfully uncomfortable at times in the most deliberate and artfully crafted ways. This movie lingers with you after you leave. It is horror in its truest form. True lovers of the genre should not miss this masterpiece.",9,18,36,10 June 2018
