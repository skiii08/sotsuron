The Lobster," Keep your hands inside the car
","I was having a really crappy day till I sat down and started watching this film. It asborbed my mind quickly and I found myself enjoying the pace and the plot very much. A few scenes seemed a little drawn out but by that stage I was too deeply intrigued by the plot to care. I just wanted to see what happened next. It reminded me vaguely of both The Sleeper (Woody Allen)I think due to the overbearing authorities and of The Hunger Games, probably due to the hunting and survival in the forest. Parts made me laugh out loud, parts made me wince and grab my boyfriends hand - and this from a devoted horror/sci-fi fan. Sometimes I was laughing at parts that made sense to me in a very personal way, I was the only one in the cinema laughing at those points; it really does make you think.I was left afterwards with a feeling that I'll not forget in a long time. I don't think I would want to watch it over and over but give it a few years and I'll probably end up buying it as I imagine it'll never be shown on TV; it's a bit too weird for that.Just relax and let this film take you on a strange journey.",9,1,6,9 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great, funny film. Worth a watch!
","After seeing the trailer I thought I'd enjoy the first half cos of the 'joining the spy' bit and not so much the second half because of lots of action scenes, which I enjoy but not massively keen on - BUT I was very surprised that I enjoyed the entire film and the action scenes didn't override the film and were very good and had some very funny bits. Colin Firth was very good, he played Colin Firth (with extra added spyness) to a tee and was very enjoyable. I found Samuel L Jackson's lisp a little bit annoying but if he hadn't had it he would have been WAY more scary as a villain! He was very funny, too! The scenery was impressive and there were great swooping shots and you could actually see what was happening (not too fast).I really liked the whole 'knight' thing and that they had Arthurian code names. The Overall impression I had was a very good film, I would like to see it again, I was glad I saw this one at the cinema and, well, I'll be looking out for a sequel!",9,6,18,27 January 2015
