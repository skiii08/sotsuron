The Lobster," WTF did I just watch??
","Seriously, the Lobster is the weirdest movie I have every seen. I love Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz and after seeing such amazing reviews I thought I was going to really be on a winner with this movie. OMG No!! Firstly I didn't laugh once. I felt uneasy and bored. Quite honestly this movie is the biggest waste of time. I'd rather watch the sexual habits of seaweed than this tripe again.",Null,1,1,8 July 2017
Wonder Woman," Exciting fun movie
",I don't know what the bad reviews wanted out of this movie. To me it was excellent and hit all the right spots for what I expect in a superhero comic movie. I was loving the girl power that was coming from this movie. It's a bad ass fun blockbuster and I'll be happy to watch it again.,10,6,16,8 July 2017
