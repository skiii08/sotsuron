The Blair Witch Project," DuDe, ThIs MoViE iS CREEPy!
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a really creepy horror movie. I think that this movie is the scariest one I have ever seen! In the beginning we learn a little about the 'Blair Witch', a locallegend in a town called Burkittsville, and the characters that are making a documentary about it. Heather, Mike and Josh are psyched about the film, but when they actually get into the woods, things get really chilling. The acting is great and totally believable.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Shakespeare in Love," A great and instant classic film
","'Shakespeare In Love' is a great film-- funny and an instant classic. It tells the story of Romeo and Juliet, with Will as Romeo and Viola as Juliet. Will is stuck trying to think of a new play, and when he meets Viola (Gwyneth PaltroW) everything falls together. It is very romantic and very hilarious at times. Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Phiennes, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench are all really great.. especially Paltrow. One of my favorite quotes is when Romeo is frantic about his play, and Philip Henslow says 'The show must-' and Will says 'Go on!'All in all this is a great movie that very much deserved to win Best Picture.My rating: 9 out of 10",Null,0,1,17 August 1999
Scary Movie 2," At parts funny, but overall not substantial
","Ok, just to set the record straight, I though the original 'Scary Movie'was tons of funny and really hilarious. I had high hopes that the levelof humor would be as funny as the first, but was kinda disappointed.
The movie started out really funny, with a right-on spoof of 'TheExcorcist'. From there on, the jokes kept on coming, and occasionallywere quite hilarious. Hanson's hand had my friend and I rolling in theaisles. But after a while, tediousness set in and the jokes lost theirpunch.The reason I think the first installment was so successful isbecause this kind of spoof was so fresh and new. But now, it is kindaplayed out and even the extremely short running time seemed way to long.In short, 'Scary Movie 2' is ok summertime fun, but I would reallysuggest waiting for video; if at all.My rating: 6 out of 10",Null,2,4,3 August 2001
Notting Hill," Good Romantic-Comedy
","I really liked 'Notting Hill'. It had a good story and plot, ok acting by Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts and likeable characters. This is just a movie that makes you feel good. Even though some plot lines are a little fuzzy and don't make much sense... this is a really sweet film.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",8,0,0,25 July 1999
American Pie," A great teen gross-out flick
","I knew that 'American Pie' would be a classic teen movie ever since I saw the trailers in the movie theatres, and as it turns out, I was very, VERY right. Every one of the cast members did a great job, especially Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who stood out in every scene and still couldn't find anything else to talk about except band camp.This movie does have some very gross gags, including masturbation and other sexual situations, but they are all very funny. This is a great movie, so check it out while you can!",Null,0,0,15 July 1999
Grease," Is ThE WoÂ®D!!
","'Grease' is definitely the word! It is surely my favorite musical (Sans South Park =) by far. From Olivia Newton John and John Travolta's great acting AND singing, to a great cast and score, 'Grease' has all the winning combinations!Such songs as 'Summer Nights' and 'Grease Lightnin'' are instant classics.. This movie is just so much fun to watch!My review: 10 out of 10",Null,0,1,8 August 1999
American Beauty," A really good flick that appeals to all ages
","'American Beauty' was a really great film that in my opinionshould win for best picture. The cast was great, the story wasreally dark and intriguing and I really think that it is afantastic movie. See for yourself. My rating: 9.5 out of",10,0,0,18 October 1999
A Bug's Life," A great movie for everyone!
","'A Bugs Life' is a great movie, and people of all ages with like it! first there's the computer animation which is spectacular, and then there's the plot with so much heart and characters who are truly funny! (Like Flick, Princess Atta and Heimlich!).And make sure you watch the HILARIOUS outtakes at the end! 'Somebody put that thing in my car!'My rating: 9 out of 10",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
Toy Story 2," A totally great and funny new kids film- thats not just for kids
","'Toy Story 2' is just soo side splittengly hilarious and great,Iloved it so much! It is I think better than the original, whichwas also very kewl. Go see this movie- Woody, Jessie and Buzzrock! My rating: 10 out of 10",9,0,1,31 December 1999
There's Something About Mary," ToTaLLy OfF tHe WaLL!!
","'There's Something About Mary' is just SOOOOOOOOO funny and off the wall and gross, but you just HAVE to love it! Cameron Diaz is so great and Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are great at playing the former crusher and sleazy slime-ball.Stiller plays a guy who (very briefly) had a prom date with Diaz in high school, and he has still liked her all these years. So he hires a scheming private detective (Dillon) to track her down; but when he does he finds out that she's a 'fox' and wants her for himself. Therefore, he lies to Stiller and tells him she's fat. He still decides to pursue her and everything falls into place.But be warned.. this movie is SICK! That is all.My rating: 8.5 out of 10",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
Scream 2," 'Scream 2' offers screams, but not as many as 'Scream'...
","'Scream 2' was very funny, scary and creative; but it can't top the genious of the original 'Scream'. 'Scream' had many laughs, and since it was the first in the trilogy, we had never seen anything like it. So the first always has the most cleverness and humor. 'Scream 2' was still very scary and suspensful, don't get me wrong. Neve Campbell did a great job, as did David Arquette and Courtney Cox. Cici's (Sarah Michelle Gellar) scene was so much fun, but still a little creepy.Murphy (Rebecca Gayheart) and Lois (Portia De Rossi), aka the dumb sorority girls were very funny. A favorite quote of mine:Murphy:'I didn't mean to break up the party!'              
 Lois:'S**t, I should have brought my drink!'Anyways, 'ScReAm 2' is a lot of fun, so check it out- along with the original.My review: 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
The Waterboy," funny and goofy, but what else should you expect from and Adam Sandler film?
","'The Waterboy' is a really silly and goofy movie, but fun to watch. Adam Sandler and Fairuza Balk are really funny, and the premise is ok too. If you are a fan of Sandler then you'll love this. And if you're not keep and open mind, you might be pleasantly surprised.My rating: 7 out of 10",Null,1,1,22 August 1999
Scream," Scream delivered many constant laughs and chills! Rose McGowan rocked!!
","When I first heard about 'Scream', I wanted to see it mainly because of Drew Barrymore. When I saw it, and realized that Drew got bumped from the movie in the first 10 minutes, I didn't know what to expect. What I saw was constant thrills and chills, plus some unexpected laughs. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox did a great job, plus Rose McGowan delivered (what I thought was) a breakthrough performance. I hadn't heard of her until this movie, and she truly stood out. It was sad to see her get violently killed, but what a way she went. From then on she will be known to me as 'Tatum'- or more Scream-esque as 'Garage-Door-Girl'. Now aside from Rose McGowan, 'Scream' was a non-stop rollercoaster where you never knew who-dunnit. Kevin Williamson's screen-play was brilliant.He made you believe everyone was a suspect from the black boots to the suspicious looks people gave to one another. Aside from a gruesome splatter fest that almost got slapped with and NC-17 for violence, 'Scream' is a great parody of all the cheap 70's horror flix made. Do yourself a favor and rent 'Scream' tonight.",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
Halloween," a CREEPY classic horror film
","A word to the wise.. do NOT watch this movie alone.. at night. Both mistakes made my me, me and my STUPID self. I say this cuz 'Halloween' is soo scary and creepy, Jamie Lee Curtis is really good at playing the scared silly babysitter, and then there's MICHAEL MEYERS! Don't get me started on him!Him with his white mask and fresh butcher knife! He is one of the creepiest characters ever! (Besides BARNEY of course!). Rent this film today if all of it's gory.. uh, glory!My Rating: 9 out of 10",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," A stupid, but funny film
","'A Night AT The Roxbury' is the kind of film you don't see in the theaters. It's a waste of 8 bucks! But I did and I was surprised. It was very funny at times, and at other times it was the stupidest movie I had ever seen.Most of this movie is purely fun, and it is the story of two thick-headed, disco club lovin' brothers trying to SCORE! It is worth 2.50 to rent, so give it a try.My rating: 6 out of 10",Null,1,2,20 August 1999
Tarzan," A good movie anyone can enjoy
","'Tarzan' was a really fun movie, for adults, teens or kids. Being a teen myself, I would usually go for the 'She's All That', 'Cruel Intentions' or 'Scream' kinda movies, but the previews for 'Tarzan' didn't look THAT bad. In comparison to the horror of 'Pochahontes' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (which were both equally dreadful!) this one looked great. And I was right.The plot is really good; action, romance, comedy, adventure, tenderness, it has it all. And the characters are all funny and creative- especially Tarzan, Jane and Tarzan's funny friend elephant (I forgot his name at the moment). Minnie Driver, Rosie 'O Donnel  and Wayne Night (NEWMAN of Seinfeld!) did a great job with their voices.The animation is truly amazing too. The 3D effects and computer generized stuff makes you  say 'wow' and there is such detail in the forest.
This movie is tons of fun.. one of Disney's best. My rating: 8.5 out of 10",7,1,1,16 August 1999
