The Blair Witch Project," A waste of time (and money)
","I've been thinking a week about this picture now, and yes: it IS  the worst movie I've ever seen. Knowing it was a cheap movie, but reading it was a scary one, I thought 'please, surprise me'. But no, this was very VERY boring. At a certain moment the first more or less scary moments occur, the lights turn on and the movie is over! Hitchcock knew how to bring suspense in a picture (like 'the Birds' or 'Psycho'), a number of movies knew how to bring scary filth (like 'Evil dead' or 'Hellraiser'), both being able to scare you in some way. This movie doesn't either of them. Together with the illogical behaviour of the 3 main characters to find a way out of the woods, I had to close my eyes many times: It was a slow, boring, illogical and bad movie. The only really scary moment was the close-up where tears (or...) came out of the  girls nose: close your eyes please... Do not see this movie: a waste of your time and money.",1,2,3,17 November 1999
