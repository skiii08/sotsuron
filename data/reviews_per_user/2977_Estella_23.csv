The Rock," Rock On!
","I first saw The Rock when I rented itjust after it had come out on video, cos there was nothing else to watch on TV. I thought it was really cool at the time. It was on TV a few days back, and cos I hadn't seen it for such a long time, I'd almost totally forgotten what it was like. Seeing it again, I was reminded of what a great action film this is. Nicholas Cages' Stanley Goodspeed is a very refreshing action hero, because unlike most macho heros, he is actually terrifed of going into combat, and finds himself crying at the sight of a dead soilder. His character is totally belivable, moving and funny at the same time. Nic Cage is a great actor, and as for Sean Connery, well, he's fab too, but after all, what else can he be? The two of them have chemistry and it's great to watch how their relationship develops. Ed Harris and Micheal Biehn, who I both think are undderated, are brilliant in their roles too. It's action packed, funny and exciting, a brilliant film.",Null,2,2,17 February 2000
Memento," Fantastic
","My sister recommended this film to me after I told her how much I'd enjoyed Guy Pearces' wonderful performance in The Count Of Monte Cristo.I got the video out, and was just blown away by it. This is the most clever and original film I have ever seen, and although at first it is a bit hard to understand because of the complex way the story is told, once you've got the hang of it you'll be enthralled. Guy Pearce is just the most natural actor I've seen, and gives a mesmerising performance, you can really feel his anger and fustration. His character is also very funny at times, especially in the scene where he discovers Dodd in his cuboard, and can't remember how he got there.This film is a must see, but if you don't want to use your brain, then don't see it! All in all, a fantastic, thrilling movie. Quite why Guy wasn't nominated an Oscar for his amazing performance is beyond me.10/10",10,1,3,18 May 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirate movies are afloat again....
","I have always been a big fan of the Swashbuckler movies,and like Jonny Depp, so rushed off to see this one as soon as it opened. Basically people, if you are only going to see one film this summer, POTC has to be it. It's exciting, funny and action packed, with a wonderful cast. But the stand out performance has to be from the wonderfully unorthadox Jonny Depp. He could have played Jack Sparrow like any other dashing rouge, but in true Depp style, he adds his own unique characteristics and make Sparrow a wonderfully funny, charming (and lets face it girls,damn sexy)character.In every scene he's not in, your just waiting for him to come back on screen. He steals every scene he's in. This film is just whats needed after the overblown self important junk thats come out this summer. POTC is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It didn't even feel that long to me.....FAB!",10,0,1,13 August 2003
Finding Nemo," Another brilliant Pixar movie
","This has got to be one of the most beautifully made animations ever made. The ocean setting is stunning, the characters wonderful. What I love about Pixar is that despite the amazing graphics, they really care more about the characters and having a strong storyline. Cos of course if they didn't have these two important factors, then their wonderful films wouldn't be as fab as they are.Finding Nemo is another hit. Funny, moving and exciting, with excellent performances from the cast. 10/10",10,1,3,20 November 2003
Notting Hill," Another brilliant Curtis film!
","'Notting Hill' is one of the most uplifting anf funny films I've seen, and easily as good as 'Four Weddings'. Hugh Grant is again wonderful as William Thacker the not too successful travel bookseller falling for film star Anna Scott played to perfection by Julia Roberts. The script is witty and never short of laughs, and the supporting cast are excellent.What amazes me though is the amount of other people complaining about the 'message' in there or other bits of nit-picking. A film like this- and indeed all films- should not be nit-pcked at. Films are supposed to take you away from your own lives and let you into other peoples, they are meant to entertain you, you're not supposed to sit and pick at all the mistakes. And with 'Notting Hill' it most definitely entertains. Hugh and Julia are at their best.",Null,0,0,13 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Maidenhead, Berkshire
","I went to see Fellowship twice when it came out, because I really wasn't sure if I really liked it the first time. I'd never seen anything like it, but couldn't quite make up my mind. After the 2nd time, I'd decided it was brilliant. I hadn't read the books (I've only just started on the 1st now) so couldn't compare it, but as a film all on it's own it is just ace.
Imppecable casting (Can't imagine anyone else but the wonderful Elijah Wood as Frodo) amazing SFX and wonderful New Zealand scenery,  and plently of scary moments and hanky moments too. Brill.",Null,0,1,27 January 2004
U-571," A disgusting rewrite of history.
","I've no intention of seeing this movie. No matter how suspensful or exciting. It was the British who captured one of the Engima machines, not the Americans. The fact that this has been rewritten to suit America is absolutley disgusting. And there is to be another film made about US prisoners escaping from Coditz, when no Americans escaped. I agree the US were a great help in the war, but to change history to suit their patriotism is terrible.",Null,1,2,1 June 2000
Gone with the Wind," Fiddle-dee-dee!
","Classic. That about sums up this film, which quite rightly is still the highest grossing film of all time, and one of the most loved. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are perfectly cast as the firery couple Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, and Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard are on top form as Melenie and Ashley Wilkes. Many films are called masterpieces, but this is truly worth of it's title, and it's place in cinema history. Like The Wizard of Oz, it took 5 directors and numerous rewrites to get it right-but they got it right in the end! It other so-called masterpieces like Titanic (which I love very much, but can't compare) pale in comparison!",Null,0,0,19 September 2002
Seabiscuit," Wonderfully heartwarming
","The true story of an unorthadox race horse and his unorthadox jockey becoming famous on the race track is one of the most heartwarming feel-good movies I've ever seen.You're really in there with Red (played wonderfully by Tobey Maguire) as he races Seabuiscuits against all odds into American history. The excitment, and nerves of the races I felt myself, and there were several times when I welled up, especially at the end. It It is a real pity that this movie was up against the giant that was Return of the King at this years Oscars for Best Picture, as I think it deserved Best Picture just as much as King did. A wonderful, heart warming film. If you feel low down, this is the film to cheer you up. Magical.",Null,0,0,20 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Something worth fighting for....
","This was the film that really cemented me as a Ring fan. I loved the first film, but after this I knew I was hooked. More wonderful memorable characters, SFX, fights, hanky-moments etc etc. I loved the way nature fights back in it too. And Sams speech towards the end is just brilliantly poetical, and fitting for the times we're now living in....",Null,0,0,27 January 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Everythings going so well!!
","What can I say about this wonderful movie? It's just SPECTACULAR!!!! Good old Baz Luhrman has given us a gem of a film. It's one of the most original films I've ever seen. It's funny, moving, with cracking songs and dances (I love the Can-Can espeially) and two of the most amazing actors on screen-Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor belting out the songs like theres no tommorow. The sets are amazing, the costumes are amazing....it just blew me away. 10/10. I can't say any more then that.",10,0,1,9 August 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Trash!
","Let me just get one thing clear. I've never liked Quentin Tarantino. Ever since I saw as much as I could bear of the horrendous Resiviour Dogs (a film which for some reason is judged a masterpiece) I didn't think I'd see another film of his again. But hearing about Kill Bill I thought the man would pleasently suprise me. But no, yet again it is juts another film which consists of nothing but a blood-splatter fest verging on the pornagraphic.Now don't get me wrong. I have no problem with violent films- Die Hard, The Terminator,etc these films I have no problem with. But Dogs and Kill Bill just have scene after scene of gore which I really got utterly bored of. I stopped both films before the end as I really was tried of it. Tarantino has to be the worst director ever. Uma Thurman and the music score are the only two good things about Kill Bill.",Null,1,2,25 April 2004
Toy Story 2," A sequal thats more then equal.......
","Saw Toy 2 last night. I've only one word to say about it: FAB. Even better then the first. The film is incredibly funny, moving and exciting, with the charaters being so well acted that they are almost real. The humans in the first film got a bit of criticism for not looking real enough, but in Toy 2 they are scarily real. The voices are excellently cast, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their roles from the first film with as much talent and enthusiasm as before, and Joan Crusak is among the newcomers to voice in the film. I can't say enough to praise this film except, role on Toy Story 3!",Null,0,1,23 February 2000
From Hell," Had potential....
","This film could have been soooo good. A fascinating story, two brilliant leads- Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, and plenty of scares. Unfortunatly it wasn't like that. Johnny and Heather are great, with brilliant Cockney accents (I don't know why their accents seem to come under such critism, I know what a cockney accent should sound like, and they do the accent great) but the film is badly put together, and lacks substance, and somehow I just couldn't care for either Depps or Grahams characters. (Depps other Cockney, Jack Sparrow, knocks the stuffings out of his detective in this one)It's not even scary..... SUCH a shame, as this film looked like it could have been very good.",Null,1,2,14 September 2003
Titanic," Overrated...good, but overrated
","No way is this the greatest film of all time. Not by a long shot. To compare this to GONE WITH THE WIND and Leo and Kate's performances to that of Viven Leigh and Clark Gable is ridiculous. Though Titanic IS good, it is no film of all time. Leo and Kate, though excellent in their performances are no Gable and Leigh, and though the film may be an epic, the ludicrous amount of Oscars slapped onto it (SO predictably) makes it less enjoyable because of the tons of hype lavished on it. Gone With The Wind was made at a time when films won Oscars for being GOOD. Today it depends on what film has the most budget and hype! Titanic: GWTW of the 90's? I think not.",Null,2,3,19 April 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fantasitic!!
","I was actually rather slow as far as the Harry Potter books go. I'm an avid book reader,so I didn't get round to reading the 'Philosophers Stone' (or 'Sorcerers Stone') till a few moths before the film opened. I loved the book, and was really looking forward to the film. I wasn't disappointed. When the film started, I felt as excited as a little kid (I am in fact 22) and was grinning like a mad woman! This film bought back that kind of childish excitment I used to feel when going to see a Disney movie on the cinema. I think we need more films like this. The casting is perfect. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all brilliant. (Ron almost steals the show)and all the grown ups are brilliant too.It's funny,imaginative and exciting. No one should make a fuss about sequences cut from the book, because obviously they  coludn't keep everything. Imagine how long 'Gone With The Wind' would have been if they'd kept everything in!I've seen Harry Potter four times so far, and am thinking maybe a fifth time wouldn't hurt!",Null,0,0,16 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Beats LOTR hands down
","Having read all the HP books and seen The Philosopers Stone, I was really excited by the new film, and expected it to be good. I wasn't disappointed. It was BRILLIANT. This film is more action packed, exciting, and funnier then the first film, with the wonderful child stars giving more confident performances. Daniel Radclife, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have really settled into their roles nicely, and the adult cast are too, terrific. Kenneth Brannah almost steals the show as the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. The showdown at the end is tense and exciting, and even though I'd read the book I still gasped in several places. The flying car and Dobby are just some of the brilliant CGI effects, and the Qudditch match is fast and furious. Just beware if you don't like spiders as theres one in there that would make any one with agrophobia faint!As too all these comparions to LOTR, I liked LOTR's very much, and will be going to see The Two Towers, but the HP films are so much more fun, and magical. They really touch the child in you. OK so LOTR scooped an Oscar or two, but when it comes to public affection, it's Harry whos literally on the money. Harry Potter has smashed it's own record in Britain, and has become the third most sucessful opening in the US behind Spiderman and the original Harry Potter film. It deserves all the success it's getting. Roll on The Prisoner of Azkaban!",10,0,0,21 November 2002
Signs," 'It's just a bunch of guys who've never had a girlfriend...'
","Having always been fascinated by crop circles, and being a fan of both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, I was really looking forward to this. I was disappointed with Unbreakable, but had a feeling this would make up for it, and it more then did. It's SCARY. Thankfully scaring us with the UN-seen rather then the seen, this really makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Mel Gibson is of course fab, and Joaquin Phoenix is as usual marvellous, and providing much of the laughs inbetween the gasps of fear! Clever, thought provoking, and marsterly directed, this will no doubt keep the crop-circled fields of England a source of interest!",10,0,2,16 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of all things
","THE BEST OF THE THREE! I really became a mega fan of LOTR after seeing the third and final film. It's just awesome! Eljiah Wood (who has fast become one of my fave actors) should have been Oscar and BAFTA nominated for this. He's amazing in all the films, but in this he really surpasses himself as an actor. When his big beautiful blue eyes fill with tears you just want to give him a BIG hug. Sean Astin too should have been nominated. Some of the scenes with him and Sam are just beautiful and heart wrenching. OK, so the end is too long, but thats the only complaint. Thumbs up to all involved. Shame it's finally ended!",Null,0,1,27 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Precious!
","This is definatly the best of the three Ring films. OK,so there was no need for all the added bits on the end, (come on, we all know where it *should* have ended) but this is the only complaint. The cast are top notch. The hobbits, particulerly Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are outstanding. Eljiah's Frodo is my faveourite character, and I just couldn't imagine anyone else playing him. Elijah makes Frodo totally endearing (those beautiful big blue eyes only adds to his appeal)and Sean Astins' Sam is lovable and loyal, and several of Sam and Frodos secens made me almost blub.(one scene involving Frodo trying to escape a certain creature made the lady next to me gasp 'oh my god!' as it was so tense!)The battle scenes are brilliant and made you want to punch a fist in the air and yell.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'We will say NI again to you....'
","How can so many people dislike this wonderful film? Well, each to his own I guess. I LOVE it. One of the best comedies ever made. Extremley silly stuff- knights who say NI (my fave bit) peasents 'being repressed!'Holy Hand Granades, and sorcerers called Tim. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Micheal Palin and co are at there ridiculous, silly best.",Null,0,0,16 April 2003
Gladiator," This is no Braveheart/Titanic!!!
","Why oh why, have soooo many people compared this wonderful movie with 'Braveheart' or 'Titanic', I do not know. Stop comparing it to two films which are so completely different, and just enjoy the film!!!! Sorry, but I just had to get that off my chest. I'm going to see 'Gladiator' again next week cos I love it so much. -Yeah, yeah, I know, it's  more of 'a guy' movie, but I think it's GREAT!",Null,0,0,18 June 2000
Gladiator," Great Scott!
","After weeks of waiting and waiting to see this movie, I finally got round to seeing 'Gladiator' this afternoon. I'd read a lot of reviews praising it, and I've always liked Ridley Scotts' work. Here he proves again what a brilliant director he is. 'Gladiator' has got to be the best Roman epic since....well, 'Ben Hur'. Russell Crowe is not a name I'd heard of till seeing this film, but I expect we'll be hearing a lot more of him after this. He is simply superb. He has a good mixture of toughness and emotion in it to make you sympathise with him, and will him on. Joaquin Phoenix's bad guy emperor is a brilliantly nasty, and probably a bit mad character, who you want to see get punished. Well, everyone is brilliant, lets face it, cos it *is* a Ridley Scott movie, and he always casts well. All in all, brilliant. 9/10",Null,0,0,6 June 2000
