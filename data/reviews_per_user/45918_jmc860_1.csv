Changeling," A True Story That Is Sure To Pull Some Tears From The Audience
","Clint Eastwood has once again created a master piece that shows us the beauty of an evil world. The story of Christine Collins is one that must be told to remind us that suffering knows no limit, and even in the worst of situations, individuals have the ability to change the world for the better. The film is by far one of the best of the year, and is sure to receive a few Oscar nominations, ( Best Actress, and Best Director to name a few.) Although it is hard to connect with the story emotionally in the start of the film, as the plot gets deeper, we become attached to the characters and you are almost afraid to see what happens to them, because you are so connected to them. Altogether it is definitely a film that you should go see if you haven't already.<ul><li>Jesse McKenzie</li></ul>",8,2,5,6 November 2008
