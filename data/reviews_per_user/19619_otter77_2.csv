Who Framed Roger Rabbit," One of the best movies ever!
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is such a fun movie that It could be viewed several times and never get boring. The story is GREAT and obviously, so are the special effects. One of the great joys in this movie is seeing a lot of our favorite cartoon characters together for the first time. Like when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck have a warm up act together on stage, or when Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse go skydiving together.One of the most effective things in this movie is it's vilain. Judge Doom is one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever seen. I love it at the end when you learn what his evil plan actually is; All through the movie you think that Doom is an evil mastermind, and at the end, it turns out that his evil plan is completely idiotic. Doom is played wonderfully by Chris Lloyd, who is one of the greatest actors ever.The plot is AWESOME. It took me years to fully understand it. It is a great mystery and the surprises never stop. The whole idea of 'The Dip' is pure genius.'Roger Rabbit' has everything, and more, that a movie needs to be great. A great plot, lovable heroes (Eddie, Roger, Bennie the Cab and Jessica), great villains (Doom and his weasels) and wonderful special effects. This movie is truly one of the best accomplishments in film.",10,0,0,6 July 1999
Men in Black," A HUGE RIP-OFF OF DAN AYKROYD'S MOVIES!!!
","'Men in Black' was a pretty good flick, but nobody seemed to notice that it shamelesly ripped-off a bunch of Dan Aykroyd movies (specificly ones that he was a screenwriter for). Let me explain, below I have included a chart that will show you Men in Black plot elements, and then show you which Aykroyd movie they ripped-off.PLOT ELEMENTS:1.The heroes chase after paranormal activity.( ripps-off GHOSTBUSTERS)2.The stars dress in black suits and sunglasses.(ripps-off THE BLUES BROTHERS)3.The stars are two crime-stoppers. One is an older,serious, and by-the-book person. The other is a young,hip,and risk taking person.(ripps-off DRAGNET)4.The plot is about aliens that try to make a life on earth.(ripps-off CONEHEADS)These are just a few of the simularities I noticed( I have a whole list of them). But still, 'Men in Black' is a pretty good flick.",Null,1,4,28 April 1999
