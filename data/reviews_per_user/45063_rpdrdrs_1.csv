Blade Runner 2049," I left the theater disappointed....
","....but then something magical happened. I don't think any other movie in the past had left me with such a strong after taste. I don't know why, but the themes started jumping out at me the next day, and I couldn't keep my mind off of it. My mind just started to involuntarily unpack all the themes and motifs that this movie had to offer, and even though it has been a week since I saw the movie, it still hasn't finished unpacking.I am learning everyday; people have been posting their interpretations of the movie on Reddit, YouTube, and other social media, and I am just falling in love with this movie the more I hear other people's opinions.I don't know why, but this is one of those rare movies that don't have an immediate impact on you, but eerily grows on you. For all you Blade Runner fans that left the theater rather disappointed, thinking 'What the heck did I watch? Why are people liking this shitty, pretentious art movie?', just watch the movie at least 5 more times, like me. And watch it in a true IMAX experience, before it gets thrown out the theaters, which it probably will considering its poor box office receptions.I don't have to praise Deakins, his work in this movie speaks for itself, and he has already won an Oscar in my heart. This movie will likely sweep the technical categories. As for the 'real' categories, I do hope it at least garners a nod for each Picture, Direction, Screenplay, and maybe, just maybe, Supporting Actor for Harrison Ford, because that man has real emotions to express in this movie, that somehow involuntarily transits onto the audience's faces too. Ford has finally made a comeback, and I hope the Academy acknowledges that.I hope Hampton Fancher finally gets a nod. He had been robbed of a nod in '83. His colleagues (Ridley Scott and David Peoples) each has at least one nod under their belts, so it is perhaps time for him too. He, in my opinion, is the master of philosophical dialogue.All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is like reading a novel of high literary significance, and I LOVED this movie. It is unfortunate that not many people are seeing it. Maybe it will become something better than a box office success - a cult classic.",10,7,16,13 October 2017
