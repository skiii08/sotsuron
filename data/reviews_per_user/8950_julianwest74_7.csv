The Lobster," This Lobster Stinks
","This movie is utterly dreadful, possibly the worst film I've ever seen in more than 50 years of movie-watching. This is not a story about human beings, it's about cardboard automatons moving around a landscape, doing and saying things that actual humans never would. 'True reflections of our society'? 'An absurdist screwball comedy'? In some nightmare parallel universe, maybe. Words aren't adequate to describe how much I loathed this film. It made me want to poke my own eyes out so I would never again have to watch a movie as bad as this one. I wish I could give it a rating of zero. Run away! Run far, far away!!",1,5,6,2 April 2018
The Shining," Nicholson's Great, But So Is Duvall
","This movie has many classic quotes: 'Redrum!' 'I corrected them.' 'Give me the bat!' 'Here's Johnny!' But the best has to be when Wendy Torrance finally sees the manuscript her husband has been working on for who knows how many months, and she is forced to realize that her husband Jack is as crazy as a bedbug. And then he comes up behind her and says, 'How do you like it?' Nobody plays crazy as well as Jack Nicholson, but I think his flamboyant portrayal has overshadowed Shelley Duvall's excellent characterization of Wendy Torrance, a somewhat dull-witted mother who nonetheless is fiercely protective of her child. It's a truly great performance.",8,0,0,8 January 2020
Dunkirk," This was their finest hour
","This is one of the best war movies I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. It's very cleverly constructed, with three timelines that gradually converge. To respond to one critic, I didn't remember any character's name either, but I remembered who they WERE: The father and his two sons who went to the rescue, the pilot who kept going when he really should have turned back, and the soldier who just wanted to get the hell off the beach. It also shows the random violence and random survival that happens in war. It's an excellent movie.",9,1,3,2 April 2018
Django Unchained," A movie that shoots itself
","I have never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino, but I know that other people think he's great so I decided to give him another chance and actually paid $3 to see 'Django Unchained.' I was surprised to find that I liked the first part of the movie. It was interesting, funny, suspenseful, and actually seemed to have a point. Some of the story strained credulity (look it up), but it stayed within the bounds of believability... until the German bounty hunter shot DeCaprio. Then believability went out the window.The movie didn't even make sense within itself. The entire film built up Dr. Schultz as not only a great shot, but also an extremely cunning strategist. And yet, he shot DeCaprio and then just stupidly said, 'I couldn't help it!' and stood there waiting to be killed. (Which he was.) But his derringer had two barrels, which presumably means two bullets, so why didn't he whirl around and shoot the guy who was standing there with a gun?He could have, but then there wouldn't have been the bloodbath that follows, which I guess is Quentin Tarantino's 'signature.' The movie quickly degenerates into a stupid, pointless bloodbath. White guys come out of nowhere to be shot, blood gets spattered everywhere, and so what?Then the film gets even worse! The black guy who killed so many white people is in the hands of his oppressors, yet instead of torturing and killing him, they decide to send him off to a (allegedly horrible) mine, thus giving him the opportunity to escape and wreak his horrible vengeance. Does this seem believable to ANYONE? After that, it's completely predictable. I don't need to tell you what happens because you can figure it out for yourself. But think about this: the movie makes a big deal about how nobody in the South back then was used to seeing a black person on a horse. For most of the film, the white Dr. Schultz accompanied Django and helped smooth the way. But at the end of the movie, Django and his (black) wife ride away on horses -- in Mississippi before the Civil War! So they'll just wander through the South to freedom? Really?? What a great happy ending! I could criticize this piece of sh*t on many more levels, but I've wasted enough time on it.I actually liked the first 3/4 of this film. I absolutely HATED the last section. And ultimately, Quentin Tarantino's popularity says something troubling about the state of American culture.",1,265,510,3 March 2013
Hotel Mumbai," Intense!
","Yes, this is a Hollywood version of what happened, as another user posted -- although I don't know that it's 'totally fictionalized.' But as a movie that puts you into the middle of a horrific situation that really happened, this is as good as it gets. It's a real nailbiter, and -- just as in the real situation -- not everyone makes it. So it's not totally Hollywood. If you don't want the Hollywood version, maybe watch the documentary 'Surviving Mumbai.'",9,3,22,4 January 2020
Avatar," King of the Hurled
","This movie is cliched junk. Is there ANYONE who didn't KNOW that crippled whatsisname was NEVER going to return to his crippled body as soon as he got into his new uncrippled alien body? Was that really a surprise to anyone? And this plot was done before, by Rich Corben in Slow Death #3 (an underground comic) in 1971, and that was better than Cameron's version anyway. This movie is incredibly overrated.",2,1,6,7 August 2018
Life," Alien Lite
","This isn't a terrible film, but it's pointless. If you've seen 'Alien,' you've seen this movie already.",4,2,3,2 April 2018
