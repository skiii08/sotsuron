Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not Menacing Enough
","Like thousands of twenty-somethings who remember the excitement created over the release of 'The Return of the Jedi' (I was 10 years old), I raced to the theater ASAP to see Lucas' newest release.  However, I must say that I was a little disappointed.  Unlike the original trilogy, there were no witty lines and virtually no character development.  A couple of characters (i.e. young Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks) were downright annoying.The story is set approximately thirty years before the original trilogy began, and serves largely to introduce characters who become significant in the future.  We meet Obi Wan Kenobi (only a 'padawan' learner at this point), as well as Yoda.  We are also introduced to Senator Palpatine, and Anakin Skywalker's mother and future wife are prominently featured.The nature of the force is briefly explained (although it was explained much more elegantly in Episode IV: 'A New Hope'), as well as the circumstances surrounding Darth Vader's birth.One gets the feeling that although the film is not that long, not enough was accomplished in terms of advancing the plot to justify the length.  There are a number of extraneous scenes that seem inserted merely to entertain the children in the audience. On the positive side- the beautiful musical score was back, as well as stunning visuals, and even better costumes than the original trilogy.  In addition, a few big name actors (I love Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson!) signed on to the film, drawing in an even bigger audience.",7,0,1,2 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2 Outspins The First (tiny little spoilers, maybe one larger)
","As much as I liked the first Spiderman, it pales in comparison to the sequel. This version has more action, more emotion, and better CGI. Tobey Maguire and James Franco push the emotional envelope here, with Kirsten Dunst offering the same reliable performance that she did in the first. Alfred Molina replaces William DeFoe as Spiderman's main adversary, although DeFoe gets a short but emotionally packed cameo. The movie opens two years after the end of first film, and things have changed for the better for Mary Jane ('MJ') Watson, but not for poor Peter Parker. He is still trying to sell pictures of Spiderman to newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson with little success. His housing situation has been downgraded since the first film, now that he is no longer rooming with wealthy Harry Osborne (who has moved into his late father's mansion). Peter is failing his college classes, and has to take a job as a pizza delivery person (from which he is fired five minutes into the movie) to survive. Meanwhile, MJ has a lead in a major play (posters featuring her face are all over NYC), and soon becomes engaged to an astronaut. Conflicted and depressed by his inability to balance daily life and the world of the superhero, Peter must decide whether to continue to do good as Spiderman or leave it all behind to be with M.J. His struggle forms the heart of the movie, and Raimi deals with it nicely until the last scene of the movie, in which I feel he takes the easy way out (although the DVD commentary suggests that Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire both found the last scene powerful). I hope that I am not giving too much away when I say that the closing scene lacks the emotional courage that the closing of the first movie had. All in all, though, an outstanding effort with many memorable moments.As far as adversaries go, I liked Doc Ock more than the Green Goblin, maybe partly because Doc's legs had personalities of their own, whereas the glider was just a form of transportation, and partly because I felt sorrier for Dr. Octavius than I did for Norman Osborne. The battles between Doc Ock and Spiderman were more intense, partly because Spiderman seemed more comfortable with his powers than in Spiderman 1. The audience also got to see more of Peter Parker as Spiderman, but without the mask. I, for one, always felt the mask was somewhat inhibiting, since it was easy to forget the humanity of the character of Spiderman when Peter disappeared behind those emotionless fabric eyes. I can hardly wait until Spiderman 3.",8,0,0,2 December 2004
Alexander," March to Your Local Video Rental Place and Get This DVD
","'Alexander' is a triumph in film-making on several levels. It is visually stunning, beautifully scored, and wonderfully paced. The movie opens with a prologue by Ptolemy, the first pharaoh to rule following the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. Ptolemy was one of Alexander's closest friends. We are then introduced to Olympias, Alexander's foreign-born mother, whose fierce ambition for her son is driven by her belief that the Greek god Zeus, rather than her husband King Phillip, is the father of Alexander. She teaches her son courage at an early age, encouraging him to touch a poisonous snake without hesitation.From the first time we meet him, it is clear that Alexander is indeed courageous, as well as a sensitive and scholarly young man, who questions his great teacher Aristotle about everything. His is both resented and admired by his father, a drunken and lecherous man. Nevertheless, Alexander proves himself early in life to his father by taming a seemingly wild horse, who along with his best friend, Hephaistion, becomes his greatest love. Oliver Stone's portrayal is honest, showing those aspects of Alexander that are more controversial, such as Alexander's bisexuality, and mental decline after the death of Hephaistion.At the same time, we see a man who embraced diversity, respected women, and had a vision for a united world that modern audiences can appreciate. A brilliant military strategist who tempered his drive for power and conquest with a profound ability to love. All in all, a well rounded portrait of Alexander emerges. The musical score is haunting, and the closing credits are some of the best that I have seen. The costumes are spectacular, the scenery breathtaking. Furthermore, the movie has an authentic old-world feel in spite of its Hollywood cast, making it closer to 'The Passion of the Christ' than a big Hollywood production like 'Troy.' Indeed, listening to Stone' commentary on his film, you appreciate how hard he worked on it, and it shows.'Alexander' is a stirring timeless epic that leaves one moved and inspired.",9,0,8,5 August 2005
Crash," 'Crash' Is A Brave Look at Human Interactions
","'Crash' is one of those brave films that dares to confront issues that nobody wants to talk about. There have been other films about racism, but they have tended to point fingers or avoid taking positions that are not politically correct. But 'Crash' is too intelligent of a film to do that.Instead we are given a group of diverse individuals, some of whom fit social and ethnic stereotypes, and some whom defy them. No one is demonized, not even those who fit somewhat into negative stereotypes, although all but one of the major character have serious emotional issues that they need to work out.The interesting thing about 'Crash' is how much I found myself identifying with each of the characters in that I have both been a victim of racism, and yet have also been one of those people made to feel guilty every time I do not like someone of another race, even if my feelings about them later prove to be right. I watched it with my mother, and we both found ourselves saying 'that's right' and 'aha' many times out loud. It was uncanny how much of what the characters said was either true or has been said before.I cannot recommend this film enough!",Null,3,7,14 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An Enjoyable Movie Going Experience
","I must admit that while I saw 'Episode I: The Phantom Menace' as soon as I could, I waited until this film came out on video before making any effort to see it. The first film lacked the intellectual depth of the original trilogy and did not hold my attention as much as I hoped it would. I left the theater somewhat disappointed. This film, however, was a lot more fun to see, and had a little more substance than Episode I, although it too failed to reach the mark set by the original trilogy.The Pluses: Non-stop action and a little romance.The drawbacks:Episode II does not advance the story much. I felt that other than grow up and become more bad tempered and arrogant, Anakin does not really develop as a character. He pouts, he whines, and he uses bad pick-up lines on Padme-none of which seem to go with Vader's personality in the later films. Somehow, I cannot picture Anakin becoming Vader. Other than the fact that both can be ruthless, they do not seem to share much in common. Anakin seems the perfect candidate for juvenile hall, he lacks the class (yes, you heard me right!) of Vader. Vader may be evil, but he is not immature. Yes, I know what you are saying, Anakin is very young in Episode II. Granted, he is probably very young, but he is also old enough to be given the responsibilities of an adult, and old enough to be a jedi warrior. Even at this point in his life, you would expect to see those qualities that later made Vader such an effective leader, since many great men (and women) show greatness at a very young age, and Vader is great in his own twisted way.It may surprise you to know that I own a copy of this film on video and that I intend to be the first person in line when Episode III comes out in 2005. What can I say...I had fun watching this film, and I have faith that George Lucas will make his last film count.",8,1,2,28 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," No one could have done better than Jackson did!
","I have read 'The Hobbit' and the 'Lord of the Rings' (I read 'The Fellowship of the Ring' twice) and I think that Peter Jackson did the best that he could with the story.  The book is more than 400 pages long and very intricate.  To maintain complete accuracy and capture every charming little nook and cranny in Tolkien's novel would take far more than three hours. The spirit of Middle-earth is evident through its occupants (i.e. hobbits, dwarves, elves, and humans), who are accurately portrayed in the movie. Kudos to each of the actors for their excellent portrayals: Elijah, Ian M., Sean A., Dominic (sp?), Billy, Orlando, John, Hugo, Cate, Sean B., Viggo, Liv, Christopher, Ian H. (did I leave anyone out?).  A special kudos to the younger actors, who showed a great deal of maturity in their portrayals. I can't wait for the other two 'Lord of the Rings' movies to come out.",9,1,1,6 September 2002
Batman Begins," Batman at His Best
","'Batman Begins' joins the Superman films of the 1980s and both Spiderman movies as an example of a movie comic book adaptation at its best. This is no surprise with Chrisopher Nolan at the helm, the man who brought us 'Memento.' True to the unique take that Nolan has on Batman, this film is not a sequel to the other four, but rather a new beginning for the caped crusader (as the name suggests). Like the other films, Batman faces multiple villains at the same time, including an old-style gangster named Carmine Falcone (played remarkably convincingly by Tom Wilkinson, who would not have been my first choice), and a devious psychiatrist named Dr. Crane (who proves that looks can be deceptive). There is a third villain whose arrival on the scene comes as a shock to the audience as well as to Batman (no, it is probably not who you think it is!). Naturally, I will not give anything away, except to say that there is a history between Batman and this person that makes facing him or her a psychological challenge as well as a physical one.Of course on the down side, Nolan continues the comic book practice of giving the villains a stupid plot to attack Gotham City, but that is to be expected. I have yet to see a comic book adaptation where the bad guys came up with any truly brilliant ideas. Instead they come up with ideas like harvesting people's brain waves so that the villain can become smarter (an actual scheme from another Batman movie).Every comic book hero must have his love interest, who thankfully is usually an intelligent woman. In this movie, it is a young and idealistic assistant D.A. played by Katie Holmes, who does a fair job of it. Among the other supporting actors- Michael Caine is good as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman brings his usual professionalism to the role of Lucius Fox (who in spite of the name is not a pimp, but rather a developer of advanced technology for Wayne Enterprises). Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe are particularly good as the martial art experts who train Bruce Wayne, and the future Commissioner Gordon makes his appearance in the form of Gary Oldman, who has always been one of my favorite actors.This film is wonderful from beginning to end, although the scenes in the ice village at the beginning of the film were somewhat confusing, and required a great deal of concentration to follow. Hang in there, and it will pay off.",9,9,15,17 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Proof Lucas Still Has It!!!!
","After seeing Episodes I and II, I was beginning to wonder what had happened to Star Wars. Would the prequel ever live up to the quality of the original trilogy? I am happy to be able to say that Episode III equals or excels 'The Return of the Jedi' (which I consider the best of the original). Like many Star Wars fans, who did not understand all the whining that Anakin did in Episode II, I was not overly impressed with the acting. For that reason, I gave Episode II a mixed review (finding it fun to watch, but not worthy of the Star Wars name). I now see, having re watched Mark Hamill's performance as Luke Skywalker in Episode IV, and finding it comparable to Hayden Christiensen's in Episode II, that Lucas wanted Anakin and Luke to take similar paths of emotional development (in order to make Luke turning to the dark side plausible). And in fact, I suspect that those who had seen Christiensen's work in 'Shattered Glass' were not surprised to see him shine in Episode III.Lucas has put together a good story, and one that succeeded in moving me at times. Among the highlights were some nice scenes of Anakin and Padme together, several particularly well done dramatic scenes (i.e. the confrontation between Anakin and Count Dooku, the 'Order 66' scenes, the 'opera' scene, the 'turning' scene, the battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan, the 'immolation' scene, and the placement of Anakin in the Vader suit).True there are problems with Episode III. However, it has enough good going for it to overlook its faults. Like Episodes I and II, heroes escape from villains too easily (perhaps a throw back to the original trilogy in which not even one storm trooper could hit his target). The dialogue has improved only slightly; with C3PO and Yoda having the best lines. Although I have always had a great deal of affection for Yoda, unlike some Star Wars fans, I was never too keen on his fights, finding his resemblance to a green yo-yo on speed distracting. And, like many Star Wars fans, I was more amused than moved by Vader's 'noooooo' (you know what scene I am talking about!).",9,4,7,16 December 2005
Munich," Very Relevant to Our Times
","Steven Spielberg's latest film begins with a terrorist attack on innocent civilians that is witnessed throughout the world. Both the families of the victims and those of the terrorists are affected, and a nation is left with the question of how to respond. Sound familiar? The year is 1972, and a group of terrorists, who have come to be known as Black September, have kidnapped and killed 11 Israeli athletes and their coaches participating in the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. This prompts Golda Meir, Israel's prime minister, to call a cabinet meeting in which the decision is made to assemble a team of elite assassins headed by Meir's former bodyguard; a gentle family man 'with butcher's hands' whose wife is expecting their first child.The team includes people who are experts in different areas of espionage. Robert is an expert in bombs. Until he was given this assignment, he worked taking them apart. Hans is a forgery expert; it is his job to keep the real identities of the group members secret with falsified documents. Then there are those who do not seem to have any particular talent, but are needed to do things like clean up after hits (i.e. Carl), or look really cool in sun glasses and add a touch of glamor to undercover work (i.e. Steve, who appropriately enough is played by the newest James Bond).As the body counts start rising, Spielberg has some of his characters question whether their mission is really the best way that they can serve Israel and their own humanity. Robert questions whether killing people goes against what Judaism stands for. He reminds Avner that the Jews are a 'righteous' people, and that is what makes them 'beautiful.' Avner questions the purpose of killing one group of terrorists, only to have them replaced by a group far more dangerous to Israel.As a whole, I found this film very thought provoking. However, like 'Shindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' it is also extremely violent. Spielberg, like Mel Gibson, is not a director to give the audience much relief from painful images. A worthy film, which deserves its nomination as best picture, with a cast dominated by strong actors, with no one giving a bad performance. The only criticism that I had of the film was that it may be a little too long, or it at least felt that way. As you can imagine, when the plot involves the location and killing of several antagonists, there is a tendency for repetition, although Spielberg somewhat avoids that by making each killing unique (as morbid as that sounds!).",10,4,6,1 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic Science Fiction
","'Star Wars' became a movie classic because it was intelligent science fiction that went beyond what had been done before in the genre.  Lucas' space opera incorporated themes from world mythologies into a movie that both adults and children could appreciate.  The result was a franchise that had both popular and intellectual appeal.  I have heard college students discuss the Star Wars trilogy as if it were the 'Illiad', and it does not seem silly at all for them to do so.What was the appeal of 'Star Wars.'  The first film in what is now sometimes referred to as 'the original trilogy' (to distinguish it from the prequel trilogy) introduced the movie audience to 'the force,' which had both a dark side and a light side; as well as a 'will'.  The universe at the beginning of Star Wars is controlled by an evil Empire, which is in turn being resisted by the 'Alliance.'  The movie begins with the capture of an Alliance ship by an Imperial cruiser.  As the movie's villain, Darth Vader, boards the ship in search of secret plans stolen by the Alliance, two droids (including one who has the missing plans) jettison to the surface of the planet around which the Alliance cruiser was orbiting.  There they encounter a young farmer (Luke Skywalker), whose father (Anakin Skywalker) was a pilot in the 'Clone Wars' (an important war, as we later find out), and an aging jedi knight named Obi Wan Kenobi (the jedi's having the power to use 'the force' for combat and enlightenment).  As the movie progresses, the jedi knight teaches the young farmer the jedi skills, and they join forces with a blockade runner named Han Solo and a princess named Leia, to fight the evil Empire.This movie brilliantly sets the stage for events that occur during the next two films, but you have to see the entire trilogy to fully appreciate Lucas' contribution.**Note: While it might be tempting in light of the release of the prequel trilogy to see them first, I think that it is best to see the original first, with the prequel trilogy filling in the gaps later.",9,4,5,3 February 2004
Thirteen Days," Kennedy Finally Gets His Due on Film
","While the Kennedy administration had its share of scandal and improper behavior, movies about the Kennedys, and JFK in particular, have tended to focus too much on the details of a torrid personal life, and not enough on moments of triumph, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Then 'Thirteen Days' came along, and dared to break from the mold. This is Kennedy at his finest, and while critics charge that 'Thirteen Days' is just pro-Kennedy propaganda (JFK's nephew even has a role), historical dramas make for more intelligent movie-making than soap operas.Besides an intelligent topic, we have a well assembled cast, with particularly good performances provided by Bruce Greenwood as JFK (who manages to be convincing in spite of bearing no resemblance to any Kennedy, let alone JFK) and Steven Culp (who is making his second appearance as RFK on film, having previously played him in 'Norma Jean & Marilyn' (1997). Unfortunately, I do not have the same feeling about Kevin Costner's performance, and I cannot help but to think of Jim Garrison (his character in 'JFK' (1991)) every time his character, Kenneth O'Donnell, appears. It is as if Garrison had jumped into some time machine so as to better fulfill his obsession with Kennedy. That is the problem with using the same actor for two different roles in two different movies dealing with the same man. Nothing against Costner, he just does not seem to quite fit.Unlike many other films, this movie relies almost entirely on dialogue, with little action or romance, so it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. It is wholly about those conversations that happen behind close doors that shape human history, and much of the drama is played out sitting down.For those equipped for DVDs, that version of this film is especially desirable, for it includes archival footage and interviews which cast further light on the crisis; thirteen days in which the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. came to the brink of war over the U.S.S.R.'s placement of offensive nuclear weapons on the Cuban island. For those who know the outcome, the movie does not reduce the suspense, while those learning about the crisis for the first time receive a valuable lesson in diplomacy and military self-control.",9,1,1,30 September 2005
Coach Carter," Violence, Poverty, and Basketball
","I grew up 3 blocks from the Richmond border, and am all too familiar with the poverty, violence, and desperation that plagues its residents. In Richmond, like in many parts of this country, young men cope with the rough environment in which they grew up by playing basketball (jerseys are sported by just about any boy under 22).Having gone to high school with these kids (or rather with the Richmond kids who were bussed to my local high school), I became familiar with their subculture. What struck me most about the movie was just how well it captured the boys that I knew from Richmond. Maybe urban culture is the same around the country, but having grown up near Richmond and San Pablo (another neighboring city), they were the only urban youth with whom I was familiar.By the way, in case anyone was wondering about the party in the wealthy neighborhood to which the Richmond basketball team was invited, here in the San Francisco Bay Area, the communities are so close together that it is not uncommon for kids from poorer areas to hang out in areas that are more affluent, or to go to parties in those areas. However, I have heard that in other parts of the country, the 'borders' between urban areas and the suburbs are not as fluid.I do not remember reading about the dramatic victories of the Richmond High basketball team in the local paper, but I did take a community college class taught by an instructor who my mother told me once had Coach Carter in his class, and many of my clients have kids who were or are students at Richmond High.After seeing so many films about events that took place years ago and far away, it was refreshing to see an interesting film about a community with which I am somewhat familiar. This film is worth at least a rental, particularly if you are from the East Bay.On another note: Go, CAL Bears.....",7,1,1,2 May 2006
Gladiator," Beautiful Tale of Revenge and Power
","'Gladiator' is about revenge and the struggle between two men for Rome, one an emperor, the other a gladiator slave. The movie begins as Emperor Marcus Aurelius ends his twelve year campaign against the 'barbarians' to secure the borders of the Roman empire. Following a victory against a Germanic tribe, Aurelius tells his favorite general (who is like a son to him) that he wants him to be his successor and to be the 'protector' of Rome until the Senate is ready to rule. He wants Rome to be republic once more, but has reservations about whether his son Commodos is willing to give up power. The favored general, Maximus, turns down the emperor's offer because he does not feel that he has the political background to rule Rome, and because he wants nothing more than to go home to his wife and child.In less than a night, Maximus' hand is forced when Commodos assassinates Aurelius and declares himself his heir. When Maximus realizes what has happened, he refuses to give Commodos his loyalty. Commodos orders him and his family executed. Maximus escapes, but his family is burned and crucified (an execution method of which the Romans were particularly fond). Maximus is enslaved and turned into a gladiator when a passing caravan finds him at his burned out home unconscious. Gladiator fights have become very popular since Commodos overturned his father's ban on them, and the man who runs the gladiator school where Maximus is being trained, Proximo, if looking to profit from his new acquisition. Although he initially refuses to fight, Maximus soon gains fame throughout the empire, and respect from his fellow fighters, as 'the Spaniard,' and eventually finds himself fighting in the Coloseum in Rome.The Rome that greets Maximus is completely under the spell of Commodos, who has won the people over with spectacular gladiator matches. When Maximus become a crowd favorite, Commodos takes an interest in him (not having recognized him). As the two men meet in the middle of the arena, and 'the Spaniard''s real identify is revealed, a power shift occurs, and Commodos realizes that he can no longer kill Maximus and still keep the Roman public on his side. Maximus realizes this as well, and what follows is a beautifully orchestrated contest of powers between the two men, which culminates in a final showdown in the Coloseum, and an emotionally charged ending.Also to be commended is Hans Zimmer for his beautiful score.",9,0,2,26 January 2006
Cinderella Man," A Fighter With Heart
","Ron Howard's biographical account of the 'comeback' of James Braddock, a Depression era boxer who briefly found himself poor and out of favor with the boxing commission (and the public) after having reached the zenith of his fame in the 1920s, is a truly inspiring story. Although I am not a boxing fan, and do not generally voluntarily see boxing films (ie. I was forcibly taken to see 'Million Dollar Baby' by a family member, and still have not seen a 'Rocky' film or 'Raging Bull.'), I had heard wonderful things about 'Cinderella Man' and decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt. I am so happy that I did! This film is appealing on so many levels. At its core, it is more about love and family, and the sacrifices couples make for each other and their children than it is about boxing. Even the scenes that take place within the ring pack emotional punch (no pun intended), and are moving.The match between Max Bauer and James Braddock is particularly well shown, and I found myself enthralled in their monumental struggle, which is shown as being a kind of David and Goliath conflict. As a result, I put aside for a few minutes my social objections to boxing, and found myself cheering for the 'Cinderella Man'. Russell Crowe brings the same Oscar worthy caliber of acting that he did to his role of Maximus in 'Gladiator' and John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind', allowing the audience to identify and sympathize with James Braddock. By the end of the film, one is made to care about the character, and the plight of his family.It is a pity that this film made only $50 million in box office sales, because it deserved far more, making it perhaps the most underrated film of 2005.",9,0,1,20 January 2006
