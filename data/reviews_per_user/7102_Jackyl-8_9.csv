The Blair Witch Project," Truly Original!!
","It's too bad that some people are calling this film the scariest movie ever. I didn't find it as scary as it was thought provoking and splendidly done. The film makers succeeded abundantly at making a film that was truly brilliant. It's too bad that Stanley Krubrick died, after 'Eyes Wide Shut' he could have learned alot about film making from the makers of Blair Witch. The movie is so well done that when it was first shown the film makers had private investigators calling up and saying they wanted to re-open the case and find out what happened to the three film makers. They had to assure them that it was only fiction. I saw two films this weekend, Blair Witch and The Haunting, the former was brilliant, the latter was just another typical Hollywood formula film that depends on specail effects and computers to entertain. See the first movie but pass on the second.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Special effects the star of this film
",No question the special effects in this movie (especailly the first 30 minutes) was great. But I don't consider a movie great if special effects are all it has. This movie was not very good other than special effects. It was just like all the other war movies I have seen. But I guess when you're Steven Spielberg you can throw up in the camera and the resulting 'film' people will flock to see.,Null,0,0,25 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Tom Cruise as...Well Tom Cruise!
","This movie seemed to last forever. I can't understand how anyone with at least the intelligence of a gnat could find anything worthwhile in this 'film'. First of all the direction was so unimaginative that my grandmother could have done a better job and she's been dead for over 20 years. It's a telling sign that a director has no real skill at movie making when he has to resort to using slow motion every 10 minutes. The dialog was so mind numbing that after a while my friend and I had to start making fun of the film just to entertain ourselves. The acting was absolutely horrible and amateurish. Tom Cruise seemed as though he was just going through the motions. I know this guy can act, he did a slendid job in Magnolia and Born On The Fourth Of July, but more often than not he simply sucks. I realize sometimes action flicks are not long on dialog or plot but usually they have some good action and at least dialog that's at a second grade level, this film had neither. I wouldn't even recommend renting this when it comes out.",Null,0,0,13 June 2000
There's Something About Mary," A comedy????
","I thought this was a documentary on how to make a bad movie. The makers of this film would have been better off taking the film and cutting it into guitar picks, at least then it would have been useful. I think I may have smiled a couple times but didn't laugh once. It amazes me what passes for humor in some people's opinion. I may have found this movie funnier if I was in the sixth grade but if you're an intelligent mature person skip this film and stare at your blank TV screen for 2 hours, it will be much more entertaining.",Null,0,0,18 October 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Bad Cinema!
","On the original Saturday Night Live Dan Akroyd use to do a skit as a pretencious film critic who only reviewed the worst movies, 'Eyes Wide Shut' would have been a perfect candidate for that skit. There weren't many redeeming qualities in this movie. The acting was very flat and Nicole Kidman especaily turned in a performance that would not have gotten her a part in a high school production. The cinematography was annoying. Especially the scenes where the Tom Cruise character imagines his wife in a sexual liason with the Naval officer of her fantasy. The orgy scene was another disaster, with it's digital effects to cover sexual acts. I mean either shoot the scene with real people engaged in sexual activity and show it or find a better way to viel it without resorting to cheap technological tricks which look horrible. The sound track was marred by that truly annoying single note at a time piano part. The ending was absolutely absurd. This is not only a bad movie for a great film maker such as Stanely Krubrick, but it would be a bad film for a first year film student. Save your money.",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Blind!
","I like Stanley Krubrick as much as any Krubrick fan but I'm not so blind as to admit when he's made a bad film. I can't believe some of the people here who have said this is a materpiece, and I'm certain that it's because it was made by Krubrick. In fact I would be willing to bet everything I own that if these same people were shown this movie and didn't know who made it they would see the truth that it was a horrible film. Oh well some people like anything that a certain director does no mtter what. I'm realistic enough to say this film was horrible and it's too bad it was Krubrick's final film, a big blemish on an otherwise brilliant career.",Null,1,2,18 April 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Arrogance
","This is a message to all those people who call other people ignorant just because they don't like the same movie. Can't you just say you liked the film without insulting those of us who didn't find it so illuminating. Also I feel you can wait 10,000 years and this movie is still going to be aweful. I'm a big Krubrick fan but I thought he totally missed the mark on this one. The movie was shallow (no story to speak of). It had an idea but that idea was very undeveloped. The acting was deplorable, especailly Nicole Kidman. The sound track was just plain annoying with that single note at a time piano part. This was not only a bad movie when compared to Krubrick's other movies but it would have been a bad movie if it was made by a first year film student.",Null,0,1,12 April 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Lived up to hype!
","I did not see Shawshank Redemption in the theater and was hesitant to see it because everyone told me what a great movie it was. Usually when that happens and I see the movie it never lives up to the hype, SR not only lived up to its hype but surprassed it. Anyone who didn't like this movie either has no heart or no brain. It's a movie which forces you in a gentle way to think and to feel.",Null,0,0,18 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great Movie!
","This was a very good movie. The young actor (Haley Joel Osment) was awesome. I've been reading some reviews here from people who say this wasn't a very good horror movie, well it wasn't suppose to be a horror movie, it's a psychological thriller. Hollywood has apparently infiltrated the minds of these people to make them beileve that blood and gore and big buget specail effects are what make a good movie. People don't seem to like anything that is going to make them think because their minds are so vacuous that they sit there in the theater and wait for it to be filled by Hollywood drivel. This movie is certainly worht the price of admission and more.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
