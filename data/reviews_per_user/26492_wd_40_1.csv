The Ring," This is a horror movie
","Although, I haven't seen the original movie, I have seen this one.  I am obviously not the only person to review it and I'm sure you will take my words with a grain of salt.  Regardless, I still feel obligated to say my peace.  I will not go into the specific details as to whether you should see it or not. I don't know your tastes.  All I can say is I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It made the hair stand up on my neck in many instances, and regardless of any plot holes, that's essentially the point of horror movies. How often do horror movies have an air tight script?  Does that add to the joy and campiness of scary movies?  Perfection is a feat rarely achieved regardless of any genre.  I will not reveal anything, just don't attempt to make the movie something it isn't.  Just go to get creeped out and realize that senseless scare tactics are often thrown only to assist the plot at moving along.  This movie has an intensity and creepiness about it and it's the idea that really matters.  I also loved how this movie didn't crap itself out at the end like most new horror movies.  Yes, the middle ran drab and gave you a sense of deceiving finality, but it ripped that from our hands and redeemed itself with a genuine classic ending.  This movie was consistent straight through.  Yes, it had it's problems, but so does every movie and if you pick apart this movie; or any for that reason. I can't imagine what you deem as good.  If you like horror movies (this is a statement only for the truest fans) then you should enjoy this movie. Don't expect much and don't tear it apart and you should be pleased to relax and let the atmosphere drag you in.",9,0,0,22 October 2002
