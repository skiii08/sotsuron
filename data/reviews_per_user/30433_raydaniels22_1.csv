Casablanca," Classic Casablanca
",Casablanca is a classic American film that tells a great tale of love and drama while showing a beautiful visual. The film shows how love for a special someone can motivate A person to protect the person they care about at all cost even if it means they are risking their own life or freedom. Seeing an old flame may rekindle that old feeling you two once had but when war is snapping at your heels how far are you willing to help someone escape even if it means losing the love of your life? I highly reccomend watching this intense love tale set during world war 2 and how it exposes some of the true horrors that millions faced of people faced during that rough period.,Null,0,0,20 October 2018
