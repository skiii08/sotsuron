The Hangover," You gotta be kidding me!
","I have trusted IMDb's rating until now. How a terrible movie like this can get a rating of 8.0 is unfathomable to me. I seriously have never even smiled once during this movie. How can anyone like this infantile movie is beyond me. None of the characters are believable. The story is just plain stupid. It takes half an hour just to get the movie started. Seriously, it took them 33 minutes to get to Las Vegas. I would just like to ask the writer of this horse manure a few questions. Why is Doug sitting on a roof for a whole day on the roof by himself? It is truly one of the worst movies I have seen. I think IMDb should seriously look at their rating system. There is something fishy, when a crap like this can score over 8.0",1,10,20,9 January 2010
