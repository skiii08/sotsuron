The Mask," 10 out of 10 is my rating
","'The Mask' is my favourite Jim Carrey movie, as it has all the ingredients of a good movie: plot, continuity, editing, acting, etc.  The dog Milo, and the girlfriend Tina (Cameron Diaz), both help our hero Stanley(Jim Carrey) foil the bad guys.   Jim gets to sing, and proves he has quite a good singing voice.  The cartooning aspects blend in well, and the whole film is engrossing from start to finish. 'From zero to hero'.",10,0,0,18 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Spooky!
","I've just seen this movie,and recommend it to anyone who likes Tim Burton's films - with their Gothic character (Mars Attacks!;Batman, Batman Returns, etc).Johnny Depp is ideal as young Ichabod Crane, cast here as a police constable, with great faith in use of reason and detection; wavering with moments of terror, but brave overall.The Headless (Hessian) Horseman is played by Christopher Walken (with head)and by Ray Park (without head) to great effect.The whole movie is well-acted and has a sinister, gloomy atmosphere which is quite impressive; a blend of science and supernatural.",9,0,0,20 August 2000
Collateral," How not to be a hit-man
","About all this film has going for it, is the cinematography. The story is confusing and open ended; the dialogue mumbled; but who cares anyway. At one early stage, it seemed we were going to have a black comedy about a bumbling serial killer who had problem disposing of his corpses, but that opportunity was lost.The basic flaw in the whole saga is: no experienced contract killer (six years in the job?) would think of using a taxi to do his work; or, certainly not the same taxi, much less chat to the driver. He wouldn't leave incriminating evidence on the back seat, nor have the vehicle parked directly outside the crime scene.As to who the killer, Vincent, is killing and why, is not explained. It seems he might be hired by one gang to bump off key figures in another. The cops come into the picture, yet fade out again. They are virtually irrelevant to the supposed 'bonding' between killer Vince, and taxi-driver, Max, which seems to be the main theme.Still, professional critics will rave over this movie, and it will go on to win awards, and make a fortune. Tom Cruise sits stony-faced in the back of the cab most of the time; reminding us of Val Kilmer in Spartan, and Matt Damon in The Bourne Supremacy - the ruthless operative, hired to do a job, who gets on with it.Yes, this is the way to make a successful movie. Let everyone think it's highly sophisticated; the critics are only too willing to climb on the bandwagon (just as they did in panning Catwoman). All you need is: a couple of good actors, some extras, a few expendable vehicles, and a city. Bang, bang, you're dead, does the rest. 5/10",5,0,0,19 October 2004
Contact," First define your terms!
","This movie is good - up to a point - but the words 'god' and 'spiritual' are never defined, hence confusion.  How many people could define what they mean by 'god/God', and would they recognise 'him' if they met him? How would you know it wasn't 'the devil' in disguise?.  As to 'spiritual', this term has links to 'respire, expire,inspire' and relates to breath - when a person dies he/she 'gives up the ghost' ie. last breath. Breath is thus equated with life by primitive people.  Science certainly deals with Nature; as to Supernature, this becomes natural when it intrudes into our empirical realm of sense-perception.  The movie is well done, insofar as it goes, hence recommended viewing.",Null,0,2,9 October 2000
