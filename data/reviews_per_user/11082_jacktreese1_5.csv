Walk the Line," Quite possibly the best picture of 2005.
","Last year, us moviegoers were given a biopic about one famous music legend by the name of Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx did commendable work as Mr. Charles. A year later, Hollywood did it again, this time with country legend Johnny Cash. Were they able to pull it off? Absolutely.Joaquin Phoenix is at his pivotal acting peak as Johnny Cash. People have said it too many times, but I need to remind everyone reading this that his performance deserves the Best Actor Oscar.The film takes us from Johnny's childhood, filled with horror, to some of his finest live performances, and through his difficulty abstaining from his drug addiction along the way.Along with Reese Witherspoon's stirring portrayal of a sometimes confused and outreaching June Carter, 'Walk the Line' is just what movie goers are looking for. If you haven't seen it yet, see it now.",10,1,2,12 December 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Walked in not knowing what to expect... walked out trying to catch my breath!
","I was in town when Borat opened at the local mall's theater. I decided to go and see it, because I had a lot of free time on my hands and enough money to get a movie ticket. I walked in expecting to be pretty funny, not knowing the laugh-a-minute comedy feast, known as Borat: Cultural Learnings For Make Bnefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. As you know, the story revolves around Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his producer going to the United States to shoot a documentary about American culture. There wasn't a single moment in this film I wasn't laughing. Matter of fact, I was laughing so hard, I actually had to walk out of the theater for a couple minutes because I couldn't control my laughing. I highly recommend Borat to anyone who wants an extremely good laugh at the movies. Easily the funniest film of the year! 10 out of 10",10,2,14,25 November 2006
United 93," Looked very promising... however...
","First of all, my review for this film is NOT based on political belief. It is NOT based on these so-called 'conspiracies.' It is NOT based on the story itself. It is based on the way it was presented.We all know the story from that dark day on September 11, 2001. We all know of the story of Flight 93, that crashed in Pennsylvania instead of the intended target of Washington, DC's capital building. Or more.This film, directed and written by Paul Greengrass (Bourne Supremacy) did intensive research of Flight 93, in every detail from the stories of the flight's doomed passengers, to the black-box recordings. However, this film does have its flaws.First, this has already been done. Anyone who saw A+E's TV movie Flight 93 knows what I'm talking about.Second, I disliked the camera work. The way it was done added realism to the film, but it go to a point where it just became tiring and blinded the atmosphere of the movie itself.Third... well, that's basically it.Overall, I would only recommend this film to those who wish to see a memorable tribute to those who died on September 11, 2001. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who feels it's too soon for a 9/11 movie, even though I didn't see any shred of negativity in the film.6/10",7,2,13,29 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Unexpectedly captivating
","Brokeback Mountain finally premiered in Rochester last night. Before I continue, I just want to say that before I walked into the theater, my conscience was saying not to go, because of my past view on homosexuality. My idea was that it was wrong and immoral.However, I still cleared my mind and gave myself the strength to pay attention. And I'm glad I did.'Cause I wasn't watching another gay-biased film. I wasn't even watching a new work that Ang Lee put out just to say he did something. No, I was watching an engaging, emotional, heart-felt romantic drama. Just with homosexual characters instead of the typical male-female romance.Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar deserves not only an Oscar nod, but a win as well. Jake Gyllenhaal was also good as Jack Twist.In the end, I learned that homosexuality should be tolerated, and that it's their own choice and no one else's.ACTING: 10 WRITING: 10 DIRECTION: 10 MUSIC: 10 OVERALL: 10",6,33,41,7 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of a visionary saga (CONTAINS SPOILERS)
","After 28 long years of box office success, the Star Wars saga has finally reached its end. In 1977, George Lucas would release a film that has been considered to be the most successful film series of all time.That film was called 'Star Wars.' In recent years, buffs may recall the release of two prequels that were a little less than 'glorious.' Those prequels were Episodes I and II, titled 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones,' respectively. (Reviewer's note: My reviews for all of the Star Wars films begin tomorrow, starting with 'The Phantom Menace' and ending with 'Return of the Jedi.') The last prequel, and last film in the saga, was released last Thursday, reeling in what I could imagine to be well over $100 Million by now.Once again, I must stress this point out: This review will contain several spoilers, as I will be going in-depth with this review.The Clone Wars are ending after three years. Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), now a Jedi Master, has been sent by the Republic to bring down Separatists Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Droid General Grievous. However, Obi-Wan and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) have learned a horrid secret--Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDarmid) is corrupt and Coruscant is under attack! In the beginning dog fight, there is a wild, engaging dogfight where we learn Obi-Wan and Anakin are trying to rescue Palpatine, who has been captured by Count Dooku. When Obi-Wan is knocked out of battle by Dooku, Anakin fights him to the death until Dooku is brought down and killed by Anakin. This is where the corrupt mind of Palpatine comes into play.Anakin is growing closer and closer to the dark side of the force. Little by little, Palpatine brings the Republic to an Empirical regime, and as Obi-Wan takes off to go after Grievous, Palpatine requests to speak with Anakin several times. He becomes closer to Palpatine, but while getting closer, he has nightmares of his pregnant wife-in-secret, Senator Padme Amidala (Portman), dying during childbirth.However, as Anakin gets closer to Palpatine and his teachings, he reveals to Anakin that he knows the force--and the ways to the dark side and how to use it to advantage. Anakin reports this to the Jedi Council, and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) places Palpatine under arrest. Palpatine is captivated by the dark side, and fights Mace Windu in battle.Anakin arrives in time to see Palpatine down on the ground, wickedly old-looking because of the dark side. Anakin obeys Palpatine's order over Mace's orders--and Mace Windu dies in glory, in an attempt to save the Republic.Anakin is in a panic, knowing he has broken the Jedi code by killing another Jedi. So Palpatine offers a chance to teach and train Anakin the ways of the dark side. Anakin bows down and accepts. He is dubbed 'Lord Vader.' As a code to all of those of the dark side, the Jedi begin to drop like flies until only two good Jedi are left: Yoda (Frank Oz), and Obi-Wan. Yoda feels a strong disturbance within the Force, and sees visions of Anakin joining the dark side. Obi-Wan doesn't believe it, until he sees it on the recorded security holograms. Padme is heartbroken by hearing it as well.Kenobi has no choice at this point but to face Anakin--who has been like a brother to him--and fight him to destroy the evil inside.And through all of this, Palpatine crowns himself Emperor and gets rid of the old Republic and begins a new Galactic Empire.All I can say is this is the most intense of the Star Wars films, and the most mature. The movie blends drama, suspense, and the same IL' Galactic fighting we are used to.There's even some familiar faces from past films, including a brief screen second of Jar-Jar Binks. We also see Chewbacca, with Peter Mayhew proudly returning to the screen once more.And who could forget, Darth Vader? MOVIE NOTE: When I said this is the most intense of the Star Wars films, I meant it. This is a Star Wars film more well-suited for the 13 and older crowd. Maybe I'm just exaggerating.FINAL THOUGHT: When the film began, people stood up and cheered. It was cool! Hoever, I found myself in tears in the last half hour. Not only because of the movie, but because of the fact that this is it, there's no more new Star Wars. So thank you, George Lucas, for the excellent films, and goodbye forever, Star Wars!
