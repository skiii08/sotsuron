First Man," Slow and Shaky
","This movie was sooooo slow and for no good reason. There's so much content they could of used but decided to be 'artsy' instead. Also, you may vomit from the shaky camera work. Not good.",1,12,22,9 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Awesome movie, some nit picks
","The acting here is as good as it gets and the music of Queen is amazing. Freddy and Brian were cast perfectly which was awesome to see as well. However they spend way too much time on what happens to a young musician when he/she becomes famous (drugs, sex, money, etc.) We've seen that story too many times to count.Still, you can't help but bounce in your seat to the music and even cry at times. Overall this is a great film.",9,1,4,9 November 2018
Black Panther," Special Effects Orgy
",This movie started off really well. There are two especially good fight scenes at the beginning with practical effects but then the last 30-40 minutes are an all out orgy of CG with absolutely no story whatsoever. Totally overrated.,1,5,7,9 November 2018
