Skyfall," Reboot complete: Bring on more Bond!
","Sam Mendes's SKYFALL (2012) seeks to answer the question, 'Is there any place for James Bond in today's world?' The plot addresses this issue head-on, and in so doing the film proves that there's still room in modern cinema for the British super spy.The film is the twenty-third in the popular franchise, and third since the series was rebooted with Daniel Craig as 007. Its release in 2012 also marks the 50th anniversary of the film franchise. Today's James Bond has been updated from the character's Cold War roots, but SKYFALL pays tribute to the Bond legacy. Bondophiles will spot several references to the previous films, but it's not like the 40th anniversary (and twentieth film) extravaganza of DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002). We do get to spend time with our favorite Aston Martin.The pre-credits chase is classic James Bond excitement and sets the plot in motion. Oscar-winner Javier Bardem plays the eccentric Bond villain. A former secret agent with a mane of blond hair, he's a computer hacking genius (finding the physicality of spy work too exhausting). He seeks a sort of revenge against M (Judi Dench) and MI6. British Intelligence is crippled and 007 is off his game. But in a world where spies are deemed old-fashioned, Bond is the only one who can save the day.Naomie Harris plays a fellow agent who has a nice rapport with Craig's Bond. Ralph Fiennes joins the franchise as an authority figure at MI6. His performance hearkens back to Bernard Lee in the original Bonds. Bérénice Lim Marlohe plays an exotic woman of mystery. She makes for a beautiful Bond Girl, and it's a shame she doesn't have more screen time.As with every Bond film, SKYFALL takes viewers to exciting and exotic locations. The action takes us from busy Turkish streets to Shanghai by night to the foggy highlands of Scotland and even to the tunnels of the London Underground.The opening chase scene is great and the action also includes a cool nighttime fight in silhouette, a 'Home Alone' booby-trapping montage, and a Komodo dragon pit. Bond also finds ways to ride an elevator and catch a subway train as only a secret agent can. Bardem's character is a little quirky and his ominous arrival at the climax is accompanied by an old rock 'n' roll song, an interesting in-story choice.Mendes does things with the James Bond character we don't often see. Bond is vulnerable and, as we learn, less than bulletproof. Bond is confronted with age and the changing times. Fiennes's character considers Bond over-the-hill and washed up. We also learn a little about Bond's past. His childhood. Not too much, but more than has ever been hinted before. Albert Finney plays a character from Bond's youth.Like other Bond films, the title ('Skyfall') sounds much cooler than its actual significance. Adele's theme song, though, is an instant classic and the title sequence suitably trippy. Adele's song is catchy and perfectly sets the tone. The theme is incorporated seamlessly into the film's Bondian musical score.The James Bond franchise has been rebooting itself since CASINO ROYALE (2006), when Bond first gets the job. In SKYFALL the final pieces fall into place, including the introduction of the modern tech-savvy head of Q Branch (Ben Whishaw). With the Bond supporting cast finally coming into the picture, the updated series is ready to roll. SKYFALL feels like the end of the beginning. It clears away the clutter and sets the pieces up for the *real* adventures yet to come. The final scene is great and will leave viewers thirsty for BOND 24.With SKYFALL Sam Mendes takes James Bond, a relic of another era, and makes him relevant and new. He proves that there is a place for super spies in the modern world and the modern cinema. SKYFALL puts the new Bond universe on a firm footing and sets the table for a promising series of new adventures.",Null,2,12,5 December 2012
To Be or Not to Be," Ridiculing the Nazi regime while it was in power
","An excellent political satire that ridicules Hitler's Nazi regime. It was released in 1942, at the height of WWII.The story is something of a comedic espionage thriller, with a troupe of actors in Poland suddenly thrust into the war after the Nazi invasion. With the fate of Poland in their hands, the actors put their skills to the test and try to outsmart the Nazis. The movie is witty and manages to make light of very serious matters.Carole Lombard is breathtakingly beautiful and great in her final role. Jack Benny is good, too, as is the supporting cast.Very topical, but still amusing and deserving of a view. The Nazi colonel is hilarious.4/5 stars",Null,0,1,6 February 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Operation Kino: A WWII movie that revolves around the world of cinema
","Quentin Tarantino puts his spin on WWII escapism. Some of the violence may shock and disturb you, but the movie isn't the Nazi-killing shoot-'em-up some viewers may expect. In fact, Brad Pitt's guerrilla squad of Nazi-killers is only one ingredient in the wartime narrative tapestry, and only has a couple good scenes. This film is dialogue-driven and spoken in several natural languages, with English subtitles as needed. (In a movie where French people don't speak German and Germans don't know Italian, it wouldn't do to have every character speak English for the audience's convenience.)The movie is broken up into five chapters, each dealing with a specific aspect of the larger plot. One part is about a French girl meeting with Nazis interested in her cinema. Another part is about Brad Pitt's guys and their secret mission. In the final chapter, all of the stories meet at a movie premiere attended by high-ranking Nazi officials.Quentin Tarantino is, above all, a cinephile. His movies reflect his wide knowledge of and respect for films and filmmakers. INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS may be Tarantino's biggest tribute to all things cinema. It's filled with references to foreign films and film history. (e.g., Goebbels is compared to David O. Selznick.) The plot even leans heavily on the motion picture industry. The main character owns a theatre. A key character is a German movie star. The climax is set at a movie premiere. The Nazis' big 'scheme' in this film is to show their propaganda movie. The theatre, the projection room, and even the film reels themselves play big roles in the story.Tarantino gives WWII a spaghetti western feel, complete with epic Ennio Morricone music. He sprinkles in his signature cultural references to film and literature (dating far enough back for the 1940s setting). And although this is undoubtedly a period piece, Tarantino spices up the storytelling with stylish flashback inserts (narrated, randomly, by Samuel L. Jackson) and some super-imposed labeling. The inconsistent use of such novelty devices, however, comes across as messy in my mind.Still, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a decent film that, if you pay attention, will make you think. Nazis are always thought of as the 'bad guys', but this film shows the enemy soldiers as real people, doing their job and fighting for their country. Sure Hitler is shown as a maniacal caricature and the Nazi officers are casual racists, but the movie gives the 'bad guys' (the German soldiers) a human face. Some brutal and inhumane things are done to the Germans by the 'good guys', and the viewer can't cheer these actions on. Does each individual soldier deserve to be held accountable for the evils of his regime?The main players in this revenge-against-the-Nazis yarn are Christoph Waltz as the shrewd and well-mannered S.S. detective, Melanie Laurent as the surviving daughter of a massacred Jewish family, and Brad Pitt as the leader of the Basterds. Diane Kruger plays a German actress/spy, Michael Fassbender plays a British soldier chosen for a secret mission, and Daniel Bruhl plays a humble German war hero. As you can see, it's an ensemble piece, with several characters' destinies intertwined. (But, like other Tarantino films, don't expect many characters to survive to the end.)Again, I warn that this is not an action movie and that the Basterds don't really take center stage. Tarantino tackles period films and foreign languages for this effort, but there are hints of his signature style throughout.7.5/10",Null,1,5,8 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," An overlooked sweet & raunchy comedy
","**A WORD OF WARNING: This film features brief but full-on frontal male nudity of the star actor (Jason Segel). The scenes are short and don't spoil an otherwise good movie, but viewers should be warned up front to avoid any possible movie night embarrassment. (It is a rated-R comedy, remember.)**The movie is about a man (Jason Segel, also the writer) wallowing around in self-pity after being dumped by his girlfriend of five years, who happens to be a famous TV star. To clear his mind the man treats himself to a Hawaiian vacation, but runs into his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell) with another man (Russell Brand). Unlikely as it may seem, the film takes an uplifting turn in the second half. The man learns to stop feeling sorry for himself and move on with his life. I'd say that FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is a great film about breakups, as it shows how depressing they can be, but leaves the viewer with a sense that people can pick up the pieces of their lives and get back on track.I think this film is overlooked when it comes to recent comedy hits. Everybody loves THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, SUPERBAD, and THE HANGOVER, but SARAH MARSHALL seems to be forgotten in a sort of second-tier of also-rans. I think this movie is plenty funny (and plenty raunchy, if that's what you're looking for), with a lot of heart and soul. I think the taboo of frontal male nudity probably scared some people away, but looking past these brief sight gags the movie is a winner in my book.I also think that people don't appreciate how great this film is on a couple different levels. The character of Aldous Snow (Brand) is a world-famous singer and the film includes two of his original songs. It's really worth checking out the full music video for 'We've Got To Do Something' on the DVD. The film itself only shows snippets and they can't do the song justice. The whole thing is hilarious, both the lyrics and the accompanying video. Also, Jason Segel's character in the movie stages a Dracula-themed puppet musical. The concept for such a musical was an actual idea Segel had in his mind for years. The songs are all original, the puppets were created for the film by the Jim Henson Company, and some actors actually get to do some puppeteering. The hit TV show that stars Sarah Marshall is a over-the-top parody of shows like 'CSI' or 'Law & Order', with Billy Baldwin providing terrible and inappropriate one-liners.A lot of effort had to go into these songs/shows-within-a-show, and I feel that the creativity goes under-appreciated. The film is funny at the surface, but it's even more impressive upon further consideration.Russell Brand is great at delivering hilariously constructed bits of dialogue, and his performance here is a minor revelation to viewers unfamiliar with the British comedian. The cast also includes many Judd Apatow regulars, notably Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Bill Hader. Rudd's supporting role has some great moments. Some less-famous actors stand out in supporting roles as staff at the Hawaiian resort. The whole ensemble (which include's Mila Kunis and '30 Rock''s Jack McBrayer) is pretty solid.FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is full of depictions of and references to sexual intercourse and features quite a bit of profanity as well as brief nudity. It is rated R for a reason. But it's one of those 'raunchy comedies with a heart', produced by Judd Apatow. Much of the humor is sex-related and/or vulgar and, as one would expect, the film features trademark Apatovian improvisation.It's a lot of fun, from the endearing characters to the comedic performances to the charming Dracula puppets. Shot on location, the film really captures what I'd like to believe is the feel of a Hawaiian vacation, with the sun always shining and the blue ocean in the background.The movie didn't impress me at first, but it had grown on me by the time it ended. There's plenty of funny R-rated comedy, but the uplifting spirit of the film is what really won me over. This film makes me feel good.",Null,0,2,7 March 2010
Public Enemies," Enough to satisfy your craving for the 1930s
","This is a great period piece/crime movie. It brings a contemporary movie feel to the dusty old 1930s. The tommy gun action is just as exciting as anything in a modern-day shoot-'em-up.It's a chapter from the pages of history, when J. Edgar Hoover's FBI made an effort to wipe out America's most dangerous criminals. The parallel stories of bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and G-Man Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) show promise, but aren't entirely fleshed out. Dillinger sees himself as a romantic anti-hero and enjoys the celebrity that comes with being a notorious outlaw. But the walls are closing in, thanks to no-nonsense Purvis, Hoover's ace bloodhound.Depp's Dillinger is a sympathetic character and Hoover's G-Men (the 'good guys') are often painted as ruthless thugs. Bale's Purvis is a bit of an exception. But the feds seem to be out to spoil poor Dillinger's fun and the final confrontation seems totally unfair. That's not to say that Dillinger and his cohorts weren't dangerous troublemakers.Set in 1934, there's some interesting historical background stuff that the movie touches upon. These were the days before the Bureau Of Investigation was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation. J. Edgar Hoover was shaping the department into an elite crime-fighting organization with a new scientific approach. The film shows that Hoover still had to prove himself, and there's some tension between administrator Hoover and field man Purvis. (Purvis seems to be the one who organizes Hoover's inexperienced and initially inept agents.) The 1935 film G-MEN (starring James Cagney) supposedly did a lot to boost the FBI's standing in the public eye.There's also a little glimpse of Frank Nitti's post-Capone Chicago syndicate. (Nitti also featured in 2002's ROAD TO PERDITION.) There are other nice period touches, like the jazz songs, Will Rogers on the radio, the early Looney Tunes cartoon, and the vintage Yankees-Cubs broadcast (although several details seem to be technically anachronistic). And, for historical reasons, the 1934 MGM film MANHATTAN MELODRAMA (with Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy) features prominently in a key scene.I love classic movies from the 1930s, but I know many people stick to more modern fare. I think it's great to see the 1930s period brought to life for today's audience. It's cool to see these cops & robbers tales play out in a way that won't be dismissed as 'dated' or 'boring'. PUBLIC ENEMIES should appeal to fans both of James Cagney flicks and of modern crime/action movies.",Null,0,1,11 March 2012
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A feast for the eyes and a refreshingly offbeat blockbuster
","A VERY fun comic book/action/fantasy movie from the creative genius of Guillermo del Toro (PAN'S LABYRINTH). A movie that goes against the grain for a summer blockbuster, mixing in comedy and humanity with all of the other-worldly creatures and amazingly choreographed fight scenes. The kind of movie where a demonic monster can get into fights with his girlfriend, share a beer with his amphibious pal, AND go head-to-head with an army of indestructible warriors. Not your typical comic book flick. An enjoyable ride, all-around.This sequel adds a bit of a 'Lord of the Rings'-like mythology to the 'Hellboy' universe and del Toro's imagination runs wild with the creatures and visuals. The sets are so intricately detailed and the creatures are mainly puppets and costumes (NOT CGI!). It's pretty amazing. (Check out some of the behind-the-scenes features on the DVD to gain a further appreciation.)HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY is, in my opinion, a great improvement over the first HELLBOY movie. It takes the quirky style even further, to greater effect. Also joining the heroes from the first film is Johann Krauss, a mist-like character housed in what resembles an old deep sea diving suit and voiced by 'Family Guy''s Seth MacFarlane.Del Toro's HELLBOY II turns the idea of comic book superheroes on its head, while also providing great other-worldly action. I enjoyed this film to no end. (The Barry Manilow song?) I was pleasantly surprised, and I highly recommend it.Hilarious, action-packed, emotional, visually stunning. I love the tone of this movie. Fun for kids, adults, anyone.4/5 stars",Null,1,3,6 February 2010
Knocked Up," An Entertaining and Touching Comedy (So Don't Expect a Rip-Roarious Laugh Fest)
","Not the joke parade that 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' was, but this film's got a lot of heart. I'd say the main focus is on the serious subject matter: a young couple struggling to make the best out of an unexpected pregnancy.It seems like a more real-life, touching kind of story than in 'Virgin' (where the focus was the ridiculous situation of a man who'd never had sex). This movie is something that could happen to anyone. There's still some comedy (mostly in the form of improvised comebacks). The film also gives an entertaining look at the differences in male and female perspectives.I enjoyed 'Virgin' and read rave reviews of this movie, but I found many one-star reviews online and wasn't sure what to expect. Personally, I really liked the film. Not so much as an uproarious comedy as a heartfelt look at real-world issues, seen through a not-too-serious lens. (There are cast and crew baby photos during the end credits.) It's not too off-the-wall and it's not too melodramatic. It's just serious enough, and there's some humor to go with it.I think most of the criticisms I read were about vulgarity. This film is rated R (or above), so vulgarity shouldn't catch you off-guard. There is a lot of swearing, but not to the extent that people were complaining about. I didn't notice it as a problem. (Maybe I'm desensitized.) It's used in conversations the way I'd hear out with friends. Not for the overly sensitive and not for small children. There is also some nudity (including a few shots of authentic childbirth action), so keep that in mind if that's an issue.Seth Rogen plays Ben, who becomes the father of Alison's (Katherine Heigl) unborn child. Alison lives with her sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd), whose marriage is work. The two sisters stick by each other's side while the two men bond. The supporting cast includes many Apatow Productions alums (including Jason Segel and Martin Starr from 'Freaks and Geeks' and Jonah Hill, who'd later star in 'Superbad'). Paul Rudd has some of the best lines.'Knocked Up' has its raunchy moments, but it's not a mindless, raunchy, fratboy comedy. Don't expect comedic genius or two hours of gags, because this movie is more about heart. This is a very entertaining film if you go into it with the right mindset. I'd bet it would be a good pick to watch with your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, or husband. 7.5/10 stars.(NOTE: I've only seen the R-rated theatrical version, so I don't know what's different on the unrated DVD.)",Null,1,2,27 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Some sci-fi fun on its own; not quite 'Star Wars'
","Overall, ATTACK OF THE CLONES is okay. Full of imaginative action sequences and sci-fi environments. But the film, like all the spin-off prequels, doesn't seem to fit with the excellent original movies. It doesn't 'feel' the same. Still, this movie should be a lot of fun for kids and sci-fi buffs.This, Episode II of the saga, tries to lay the groundwork for the upcoming war and the fall of the Republic. A good amount of time is spent on a sappy romance. But there are enough battles and chases to keep viewers satisfied.As a fan of the original films, I can't quite embrace the prequels. There's just something about them...The Good:A space chase through an asteroid belt, the return of the Tatooine moisture farm, the introduction of the clone army, John Williams's score, Obi-Wan's storyline, and Natalie Portman (she's very pretty).Obi-Wan goes on an investigation into the attempted assassination of Senator Amidala. This story plays out like a Bogart detective noir. He travels around the galaxy, meeting people and gathering information, trying to piece the clues together. Dexter Jettster, an informant in a diner, is particularly cool. A good piece of voice acting. I just thought it was interesting to see the detective-mystery storyline in a Star Wars film.The Bad:The overly sentimental love story, the boring politics, some silly chase sequences, the green-screen sets, and Hayden Christensen's terrible acting. As Anakin Skywalker, the main focus of the prequel trilogy, Christensen is just awful. His performance is wooden and amateurish.. . . . .The prequels just can't live up to the original Star Wars movies. They just don't feel the same. I can't really explain it, but the original movies seemed realistic. War movies set in another galaxy. The prequels are more like sci-fi fantasy adventures.I think part of it is the overuse of CGI. The new movies are created almost entirely in a computer. Most of the sets, backgrounds, creatures, vehicles, and effects, and even some major characters, are created digitally. And as impressive as the technology is, viewers can still tell that what they are seeing is not real.The original trilogy seemed more 'real'. It used models, miniatures, puppets, practical effects, and real sets. The vehicles and equipment looked used and realistic, not polished and sleek and design-oriented.And the stories are different, too. The originals were about a band of interesting characters in a war against a powerful enemy. They were underdog stories. And they had a sort of hokey charm. The recent prequels are grand and operatic space romances. If that makes any sense...Still, ATTACK OF THE CLONES has some fun action and interesting sequences. It's an important transitional film in the series. It's not classic Star Wars, but taken as it is, the movie can be pretty enjoyable.",Null,3,6,5 August 2009
Watchmen," Great...for a comic book movie (and NOT a family-friendly action flick)
","Not a great 'film', per se, but a very good comic book movie. Not fun and exciting, but dark and bada**. WATCHMEN explores the darker side of superheroes. Who they are, why they do what they do. Their histories, their faults, their inner demons.Rated R, there's bloody violence, sexual conduct, nudity, explicit language, disturbing imagery, and everything else. Definitely not for kids.Having read the source material, I can say that this is a very faithful adaptation, as adaptations go. They took the story right out of the graphic novel and did their best to shape it into a movie. Some details were tweaked, but the big picture remains intact and some very specific details and images are preserved for the fans.The movie is a nice escape, taking viewers into a self-contained universe of costumed heroes and exotic settings. People unfamiliar with the comic may be hesitant to see a film with such 'unknown' characters, but I think it would be fun immersing oneself into this very unique universe.The action tends to be a bit too stylized and graphic for my tastes, and the soundtrack is curious. Though carefully selected from the book, the songs often seem like an odd hodgepodge of retro tunes, feeling weird on top of the gritty visuals.But WATCHMEN takes comic book action movies to a place they've never gone before. And though the film will never win any awards, it is an intriguing new take on the cape-and-cowl crowd and a great ride.EDIT:I think the overwhelming backlash to this movie stems from misplaced expectations. This is NOT a superhero action movie like SPIDER-MAN or IRON MAN or X-MEN, and it was not ever meant to be. Maybe the marketing is to blame.WATCHMEN is based on a cynical and philosophical comic series for adults. No children should see this film. It's not that kind of movie. And the brutal scenes are taken right from the comic. I can understand complaints about the length (nearly 3 hours) and I can understand the plot being confusing to people who left the theater after 1 hour, but I think there's enough in the film to make it make a certain amount of sense. Reading the book should help people who wouldn't otherwise understand the movie. Repeated viewings might also help.This type of movie might not be your cup of tea, and that's fine. But you should be aware of what kind of movie WATCHMEN is. Do not expect a fun superhero/sci-fi action flick. Don't let the costumes fool you. And don't sit down on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn for Family Movie Night. This is a film for adults only. It's rated-R, after all.Just know what you're getting into before you pop in this movie.",Null,0,2,4 August 2009
Armageddon," A guilty pleasure of mine
","I've always kinda liked this film. Sort of a guilty pleasure of mine. The script is cheesy in parts, but the film makes up for that with thrilling outer space/end-of-the-world drama.NASA has only one chance to blow up an asteroid that threatens all life on Earth. One chance to do it and do it right. We feel for the guys sent on the mission, but at the same time we know that if they can't get the job done, the entire human race will be wiped out.There are parts of the movie that will make you start to tear up. These ordinary men are sent on a dangerous mission to save humanity, and (minor *spoilers*) not all of them come home safely. One particular tragedy is especially sad. But then the film comes back with some uplifting moments as well.There's also plenty of Michael Bay explosions and grand scale destruction.I can understand the complaints people have with this film. I noticed a few myself when watching the movie for the first time in years. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, the romance (particularly the 'animal cracker scene') doesn't really work, there are too many clock-ticking-down-to-one-second scenarios, and a lot of scenes are overly sentimental (with dramatic slow-motion). I can see these flaws, but the fun and the thrills balance them out for me.(One gripe that I can't agree with is the film's lack of scientific plausibility. No sound in space? No explosions? In a film like this, scientific accuracy is not what's important to me. I don't expect to find realism. The movie is entertaining the way it is.)The cast includes several familiar faces (Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc.) and the ensemble is kind of fun. (Though I've never been much of a Liv Tyler fan.)If nothing else, the movie is worth watching for the performances of Steve Buscemi (as a borderline insane maybe-genius) and Peter Stormare (as the crazy Russian cosmonaut). Buscemi is great.While it's not perfect, there's a lot to like in Armageddon. It's a fun ride and a classic 'save the world' epic. I'd rate the movie about a 6, but I couldn't help but enjoy certain parts enough to bump my final grade to a 7/10.",Null,4,6,6 February 2010
North by Northwest," Adventure, mystery, excitement, suspense... A lot of fun from Hitchcock
","Like a James Bond movie with a twist: the hero is not the spy everyone thinks he is. He's an ordinary man thrown into extraordinary situations. The setup is full of comedic potential, but Alfred Hitchcock crafts it into a thoroughly enjoyable adventure mystery.Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken by the 'bad guys' to be George Kaplan, a government agent. Thornhill cannot convince them of the mix-up and, after narrowly escaping with his life, cannot convince anyone of what happened to him. He decides to find the REAL Kaplan and get to the bottom of things. On the run from the bad guys and the law, Thornhill becomes pretty good at the secret agent game.More action-adventure-y than other Hitchcock films I've seen, this one still has plenty of suspense and is quite a bit of fun. Cary Grant brings humor to the lead, Bernard Herrmann's score is thrilling, and Hitchcock provides some iconic movie moments (not the least of which being the climactic chase sequence set at a national landmark). The scenes between Grant and Eva Marie Saint are full of innuendos.Hitchcock's adventure thriller calls to mind the early James Bond movies, even though it predates those films by a few years. There are undercover agents, villainous henchmen, rather sophisticated antagonists, many different locations, exciting action sequences, twists and turns, and sexy romantic interests. Missing are the Bond films' flashy gadgets, over-the-top villains, grandiose world-domination schemes, and bikini-clad women.What's interesting about Roger Thornhill's adventure is that he starts out as an advertising executive out to clear his name and set things straight. But when it becomes clear that the bad guys are always one step ahead of him he takes matters into his own hands and, really, becomes a spy.",Null,0,1,2 July 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," A new Spider-Man for a new generation
","A new Spider-Man for a new generation. This Peter Parker is a much more contemporary outcast, full of angst. No longer a bookish science nerd, Pete's a skateboard-riding introvert. And like all high school kids, he's got issues he's struggling with. Growing pains, personal stuff. He's moody, he's rebellious. This Peter Parker is meant to appeal to today's youth. He could be a friend or a classmate or a neighbor. He is a stand-in for every teenager who teethed on cell phones and grew up on the Internet.Personally, I feel just a little too old for this interpretation, but the update probably keeps the character fresh for modern audiences. Sam Raimi's films are more traditional adaptations of the comics, while this is a cinematic re-imagining of the source material. The familiar ingredients are there (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, genetically-engineered spiders), it's just a matter of how they're used. Your miles may vary, but I wasn't quite in sync with director Marc Webb, although I could see what he was going for. The best thing about this movie is Emma Stone. The Lizard looks lame and some of the special effects look too fake. And the story isn't particularly gripping. But maybe I'm just too old.",Null,1,4,4 September 2013
Quantum of Solace," A twenty-first-century action thriller, featuring James Bond
","It's unfair to compare QUANTUM OF SOLACE with the old James Bond films. Daniel Craig's movies have an entirely different style and tone. They are gritty and real-ish. Serious spy thrillers set in the modern world.QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a good follow-up to CASINO ROYALE (2006), although the former is not as good as the latter. Daniel Craig is back as a brutal James Bond and the film continues the series' new deadly serious tone.In this outing, James Bond investigates a top-secret global crime organization. When MI6 isn't sure it can trust 007, Bond goes rogue. In that respect, and the underlying revenge theme, the film is similar to LICENCE TO KILL (1989). The story is pretty interesting, with betrayals, reveals, and twists and turns along the way. It rounds out the 007 origin story started in CASINO ROYALE and sets up the new Bond universe for future installments.At first glance QUANTUM OF SOLACE may not seem like a 'Bond film'. There's no gun-barrel opening. There are no fun spy gadgets. James Bond is more thuggish and less suave. There's very little humor. The action scenes are edited together with quick cuts and enhanced with digital touches.But the film does have many of the James Bond staples. Exotic locations (Italy, Haiti, Austria and Bolivia). Action. A lovely female companion. A casual fling between Bond and a woman he just met. A gray Aston Martin. There's even a gala scene where Bond gets to wear a tuxedo.Still, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is stylistically unlike any other Bond film. It doesn't even try to 'look' like a 'Bond film'. It has its own style. The quick cuts, the different typefaces, some interesting camera angles. The director seemed to want to make a more 'artistic' James Bond movie. There's a fight scene intercut with an opera performance that is totally un-Bond-like, but pretty interesting nonetheless.There's plenty of action, including a car chase, a foot chase, and a boat chase. One of my favorite sequences involves an airplane escape. This movie makes full use of 21st-century film-making techniques, enhancing the action scenes with CGI when needed (although there's still a lot of quality stuntwork). There's even a little bit of slo-mo. But the movie is edited with such quick cuts that I believe the action suffers. The viewer can't fully appreciate the sequences because of all the jumping around and close-ups.QUANTUM OF SOLACE is not one of my favorite James Bonds, but I did like it. Parts of it, at least. It may not have the familiar 'feel' of a Bond film, but it fits with the serious tone of the revamped series. It certainly has none of the campiness that brought down some of the lesser (older) Bond movies. It's an action thriller, and as such it is occasionally thrilling. However, it lacks that special something to set it apart as both a Bond film and a generic thriller. It's serious and gritty and action-packed and it has hints of 007's signature coolness, but the villain and climax were underwhelming and the editing was too choppy. It's good, but not great.* * *QUANTUM OF SOLACE is the twenty-second official James Bond film and the second to star Daniel Craig as 007. The Bond girl is Olga Kurylenko. The villain is Mathieu Amalric (THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY). The secondary Bond girl is Gemma Arterton. Judi Dench returns as M for the sixth time. Jeffrey Wright reprises his role as Felix Leiter of the CIA.",Null,3,14,14 May 2010
No Country for Old Men," Enjoyable and Suspenseful Film
","I really enjoyed this movie. Very suspenseful. You're pulling for the Vietnam vet to outsmart the heartless assassin and there are all kinds of twists and turns and whatnot. I did not find this film boring at all.You need to pay attention during this movie or it might not make sense. It might be best to watch it a couple times. I liked it the first time, but on second viewing I noticed things that I'd missed before. And I definitely think this is a good movie for repeated viewings, as long as you liked it. Engrossing suspense.As to the ending, it's controversial. I won't give it away, but some people like it and some people hate it. I guess what you might want to think of is that Tommy Lee Jones's sheriff character (the 'old man' in the title) is really the main character. The point of the story is how the world is changing, as seen by an old Texan sheriff. Everything else happens around that.I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book, but this film is supposed to be very faithful to it, ending and all.The story also seems to deal with some fairly deep philosophical ideas, which I am not prepared to delve into. You can find out more about that stuff in the discussion topics.I'm not a film scholar, but I had no problems with this one, acting, writing, directing, or otherwise. There IS violence, and that didn't bother me. If you don't like violence, this might not be for you. Definitely not for children, and that's why it's rated R.Despite the violence and the blood, this isn't an 'action' movie. But this film commands your attention and has you on the edge of your seat. Even when you know how it all ends, it's still fun to go along for the ride all over again.I could watch this film again and again and again.",Null,3,5,24 April 2008
The Incredibles," A thrilling action film that packs an emotional wallop
","THE INCREDIBLES is two hours of solid entertainment. It's got a little bit of everything, and should appeal to just about anyone. It's a kind of animated tribute to superheroes, while also being a movie about families. It's fun, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, it will make you laugh, it will make you tear up, and it's full of true-to-life moments.The movie will satisfy anyone's needs for superhero action, featuring costumed crusaders using their extraordinary powers to save the day. But the film tries not to fall into the traps of superhero clichés. It even makes light of when villains 'monologue', giving the heroes time to foil their plans. The movie keeps you on your toes. Just when you think something has happened, the tables are turned.But THE INCREDIBLES really knows how to stir up a viewer's emotions, too. You feel for the characters. The superhero children are put in very real, life-threatening danger. You hold your breath. The father thinks he's lost his family. A wife worries about her marriage. A nefarious and murderous plot is revealed. The kids triumphantly discover their own capabilities, and not a moment too soon.The movie doesn't really hold back. It gets you concerned that something awful might happen, holding the tension. Brad Bird, who directed the film, did not come up through Pixar. He was an animation director in the industry who joined up with Pixar because he admired how they did things. (His earlier work includes THE IRON GIANT.) I think that might be why THE INCREDIBLES feels a bit darker than other Pixar films. It's rated PG. Most Pixar films, great as they are, seem overly kid-friendly and G-rated. THE INCREDIBLES is safe for kids, but it has an edge to it and it is still appealing to adult viewers.And another thing the movie does so well, besides superhero action, is family matters. There are little moments that could have been taken from real life, from any of our real families. That makes the characters relatable. For instance, the bickering siblings at the dinner table. Or the mom who calls the dad to dinner while he's busy 'watching TV'. The shy teenage daughter who harbors a crush for a boy at school. The parents arguing over which exit to use on the expressway. To me, the family stuff is one of the film's strengths. It's the source for much of the emotional impact. Throughout the film, the characters are tested again and again, and we as viewers are genuinely concerned for them. Grown-up viewers (particularly parents, I'd wager) might connect more with the emotional family storyline, while the kids will enjoy the action. Different levels...THE INCREDIBLES is kind of like a James Bond film. There are heavily guarded bases, secret hideouts, missile launches, exotic locales, and a great deal of sneaking around. The score by Michael Giacchino (which is excellent, by the way) seems to evoke some 007, too.The movie is like a Bond film with a dash of 'Watchmen' (superheroes being outlawed), a hint of the Fantastic Four (some of the powers, plus the superteam concept), and a family-oriented skew.I really can't get over how great THE INCREDIBLES is, having just watched it for the first time in quite a while. It's fun and action-packed, and I love it for that. But it also really works up your emotions, getting you invested in the characters on the screen. It is enjoyable for the whole family, with something for kids as well as older, wiser adults. It's well-rounded. The opening prologue sets up the fictional world and gives a historical background to the movie. The music is great. The stylized end credits are visually awesome. It's an animated Pixar feature, but it's as exciting as any action/adventure film. It may not be as cutesy as other Pixar movies you may enjoy, but THE INCREDIBLES is an excellent film all-around. It's a blast.",Null,0,0,25 November 2009
The Illusionist," Just didn't do it for me...
","A dark fairytale about a magician of extraordinary ability and his childhood sweetheart, now a duchess set to marry an evil prince. Part story of forbidden love, part investigation into the magician's secrets.Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into this movie. Edward Norton, Jessica Biel & Co. adopt silly fake European accents. Paul Giamatti was alright, I guess. I just wasn't feeling this film from the start. (Maybe I was having an off day...) The movie gets a little more interesting as it takes an eerie turn.For an alternative magician mystery, I'd recommend Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE (oddly also released in 2006).",Null,1,1,30 June 2009
Castle in the Sky," A wonderfully imaginative and action-packed animated adventure
","This Japanese animation from the creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki is an action-packed adventure. It seems to take place in a version of the early 1900s where aviation technology is very common. Miyazaki's imagination offers us an amazing adventure, with enormous air ships, sky pirates on insectlike speeders, giant robots, courageous characters, some breathtaking scenery, and an ancient floating kingdom.A young girl is being chased by a clan of treasure-seeking pirates as well as government military forces. The girl, in possession of a mysterious stone that holds the secrets of an advanced civilization, meets a heroic young boy who risks everything to protect her. Action waits around every corner. Each sequence seems to open a new gateway of wonder.A great animated adventure. There is some violence, but it should still be a great movie for kids",Null,1,1,6 February 2010
The Holiday," A 'chick flick' for sure, with some cool movie references
","As a guy, I found THE HOLIDAY (2006) to be a little too girly, which is understandable since the film was written and directed by a woman and primarily deals with two women trying to sort out their personal troubles. It's not my cup of tea and I get that. Still, I'd say the movie's pretty good for what it is. If you're looking for a romantic 'chick flick' to watch around Christmastime, you've found it.Kate Winslet, an English journalist, and Cameron Diaz, a Hollywood movie trailer editor, decide to swap houses for two weeks during the Christmas holiday. Winslet needs to get over an unrequited love and Diaz needs time alone after a breakup. Winslet is like a kid in a candy store in sunny Los Angeles, while Diaz takes more time adjusting to the quiet country life in snowy Surrey, England.The most sympathetic character for me was Kate Winslet, who gives a winning performance. She plays the comedy well in her early 'sad sack' scenes and later becomes a beacon of positivity and joy. Cameron Diaz is Cameron Diaz, I'm just not really a fan. I liked the gimmick where Diaz sees/hears her life as if it were one of her movie trailers. Jude Law is pretty good as Winslet's brother, who meets Diaz unexpectedly in Surrey. Jack Black dials it down a bit as the lovable nice guy Winslet meets in America.What I will say is that I love old black and white films. I caught THE HOLIDAY on Turner Classic Movies, of all places, and enjoyed the various shout-outs to classic Hollywood. Eli Wallach plays Cameron Diaz's Hollywood neighbor, an ancient screenwriter who befriends Kate Winslet during her stay in L.A. He reminisces about the old days and gives Winslet a list of classic films to check out. We never see the list, but it seems to contain some great screwball comedies including HIS GIRL_FRIDAY (1940) and THE LADY EVE (1941), as well as some Irene Dunne movies (perhaps THEODORA GOES WILD (1936) or my favorite THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937)).It's great to see Eli Wallach (BABY DOLL (1956), THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966)) still doing stuff. He looks about a hundred years old in THE HOLIDAY, but was really only around ninety. His character's connection with Old Hollywood was a pleasant surprise for me and is probably part of the reason this recent film made it onto TCM's schedule.Jack Black plays a score composer and there's a cool scene in a Blockbuster store where he singles out various films with memorable music scores (CHARIOTS OF FIRE, DRIVING MISS DAISY, GONE WITH THE WIND, JAWS, THE GRADUATE, etc.). As a movie buff I always appreciate nods to the classics and hope they expose modern viewers to some oldies but goodies.",Null,0,1,19 December 2013
Kong: Skull Island," For action and excitement, KONG does not disappoint
","Merian C. Cooper and company tapped into something special with the original KING KONG (1933), captivating audiences with a fairly simple adventure fantasy (humans explore an undocumented island full of giant prehistoric monsters, and then bring one of the creatures back to modern civilization) and state-of-the-art cinematic special effects. But the story continues to resonate with moviegoers, through updates and retellings, out of a sympathy for Kong, the wild animal who fights dinosaurs at home, but is out of his depths in man's world.The 1976 remake of KING KONG set the familiar events in the (then-)modern world, with shady oil corporations and environmentalists. In 2005, LORD OF THE RINGS helmer Peter Jackson retold Kong's story using the latest special effects technology, setting the three-hour epic during the original 1930s time period (and especially emphasizing Kong's emotional connection with Naomi Watts's would-be damsel in distress).Over a decade later, KONG: SKULL ISLAND (2017) brings the giant gorilla back to the screen for a new generation, and a new blockbuster franchise. As the title suggests, the film is all about Kong's homeland of Skull Island. The film doesn't follow in the footsteps of prior iterations, as it positions Kong as a character who can appear in future sequels and spin-offs (facing off against other giant movie monsters from the Godzilla family of films).Like the 1976 film, SKULL ISLAND updates the Kong story from the old-timey 1930s, placing the events in the retro 1970s. Specifically 1973, at the close of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Exploring the unexplored island is John Goodman, a monster hunter supposedly (and secretly) working on behalf of the U.S. government's Cold War interests (find the monster before the Russians do!) and accompanied by Samuel L. Jackson's helicopter squadron, fresh off their tour in Vietnam and ready to head home. Also along for the ride are Tom Hiddleston, an expert tracker to get the team through the jungle; Brie Larson, an anti-war photojournalist; and assorted scientists and technicians.There's tension among the crew even before they encounter the skyscraper-sized gorilla. Military man Jackson and anti-war Larson don't see eye to eye, the scientists stick their noses up at the soldiers, and Goodman's urgency to find his monster puts him at odds with the better judgment of those who'd abort the expedition due to hellacious weather conditions. Once he witnesses Kong's destruction, Jackson, bitter about the outcome in Vietnam (a war that wasn't 'lost', but 'abandoned'), focuses his entire being on destroying his hairy nemesis (an unpopular agenda among survivors keen on escaping the island with lives and limbs intact).Worries of the sympathetic creature in Peter Jackson's 2005 film having been truly recast as a hellish 'monster', a terrible force of nature, may persist after the horror of Kong's first encounter with the helicopter squadron. But, new direction and all, SKULL ISLAND makes sure to hit upon the beats of the winning King Kong formula.As is tradition, a tribe of natives inhabits the island. But this time there are no ritualistic sacrifices at the altar of Kong. In this version, the natives worship Kong as their protector, for it is the great Kong who keeps the nasty 'skull-walker' reptiles at bay and fights off the other Skull Island beasties. John C. Reilly plays a marooned WWII pilot who's been living among the Skull Islanders for twenty-eight years and can explain things to the wandering survivors.In this way, Kong is softened a little. He's merely protecting his territory from invaders. And in the grand scheme of things, Kong fights on the humans' side, or at least provides necessary opposition to the man-eating terrors that await in the jungles of Skull Island. Kong is no real threat unless provoked, and the humans need Kong on their side if they hope to survive.There's even a hint of Kong's famous weakness for pretty girls, in a scene where the savage Kong is tamed, if only for a second, by the beauty and kindness of Brie Larson. SKULL ISLAND eschews the damsel-in-distress story-line, but pays homage to the connection between 'beauty' and 'the beast'.SKULL ISLAND is packed with action and terror. Besides Kong batting helicopters out of the air and stomping on fleeing personnel, there are the giant bone-chomping reptiles, vicious pterosaurs, towering spiders, and other unknown dangers threatening the scattered crew. Viewers never know what might happen. People die in a multitude of horrible ways. Survival until the final credits is certainly not assured, and the film builds on its tension with some clever match cuts.One particularly tense scene makes inventive use of a malfunctioning camera flash to track a creature through the fog, and another scene subverts an expected act of heroism. The action scenes throughout the film are exciting, and make for a fun trip to the movies.Samuel L. Jackson is scary as a slightly unhinged general hell-bent on avenging the deaths of his men. John C. Reilly steals the show as only he can, combining his signature brand of crazy with the film's moral center. Hiddleston and Larson are good, too, but despite little character moments, the main soldiers remain forgettable monster fodder.The quasi-modern update is welcome and refreshing dressing for the bones of the adventure plot, with the Vietnam conflict right in the rear-view mirror and the Cold War context. The technology is modern-ish, but pre-digital (to keep things interesting), and the period rock music played by the soldiers is still popular today.King Kong purists may miss the Empire State Building, but for the purposes of the new Kong-Godzilla shared movie franchise, SKULL ISLAND's narrower focus seems appropriate, and this latest version of Kong manages to take a new approach to the mythos while honoring its legacy. This new Kong is still Kong, and maybe audiences will soon get to see this protector of mankind step in against other famous larger-than-life creatures.",Null,2,4,22 June 2017
Sherlock Holmes," An entertaining take on the eccentric genius
","This is a new and different take on the well-known Sherlock Holmes character, and I must admit a rather entertaining one. The film emphasizes Holmes's eccentricity, and Robert Downey Jr. is great as the genius oddball.Director Guy Ritchie uses his signature quick-edits to provide glimpses into the extraordinary mind of the super-sleuth. In a fight, we see Holmes plan his next several moves the split-second before he needs to use them. We see, after the fact, all of the pieces that Holmes brings together to solve his little mysteries.The film has a wonderfully offbeat tone, which makes up for some of the shortcomings in the plot and action. Hans Zimmer's quirky music score is excellent.Jude Law plays Dr. Watson, Holmes's loyal sidekick. In fact, the brotherly love between Holmes and Watson is one of the underlying themes of the movie, as Watson plans to leave Holmes and get married. Holmes values Watson's companionship and doesn't want the duo to split up. Their differing styles complement each other so well. Rachel McAdams plays the female lead, Sherlock's old flame and a cunning thief.This movie isn't quite like earlier screen incarnations of Arthur Conan Doyle's literary hero. But that is in no way a bad thing. This film stays true to the essence of the master detective, while telling a fun and exciting story. Downey's Holmes is unquestionably a genius intellect, as well as a master of disguise and a decent fighter. He smokes a pipe, he plays a fiddle, he has odd hobbies, he's very witty, and he's a tad inept socially. Law's Watson, an army veteran, is a man of action and a capable right-hand man (a departure from the bumbling image the character sometimes conjures up). The film is fairly action- packed, with some brawls and a couple big CGI set pieces. But the focus remains on Holmes and his impressive deductive powers. The tone set by the director and actors makes this a fun Victorian Era adventure. (The whole affair has an almost 'Pirates of the Caribbean' vibe, on a smaller scale.)The main case is a complex web of murder and mysticism, but the fun is in accompanying Downey's Holmes for the ride.",Null,0,0,8 March 2011
Ben-Hur," A landmark epic powerful enough to restore one's faith in faith
","This film explains what the Christian faith is all about, through the story of a man whose life has been thrown into turmoil.The life of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), the prince of Judea, is destroyed by the Roman Empire. After years of enslavement, Judah makes an unlikely return to Judea. A man of great faith, Judah becomes increasingly bent on revenge. Life under Roman rule has changed him. But with the help of the woman he loves and the teachings of a rabbi from Nazareth, Judah may find his faith once more.You see, the story of Judah Ben-Hur coincides with the story of Jesus. Jesus isn't a full-fledged character in this movie, but he appears at different points. It was the kindness of Jesus, a stranger, that gave Judah the will to live while he was a slave. And when vengeance had gotten Judah in its grip, the hope offered by Jesus restored his goodness. Only by then Jesus was sentenced to death by the Romans.BEN-HUR is a Biblical epic that I found surprisingly entertaining. There's a love story aspect, there's Judah's journey to get back at the man who imprisoned him, there's the classic chariot race scene, and there's the Biblical stuff about the influence of Jesus in the Roman world. The 3-1/2 hour film is manageable because so much happens from beginning to end.Hugh Griffith gives an enjoyable supporting performance as an Arab sheik. Stephen Boyd plays the complete jerk who was once Judah's best friend. Jack Hawkins is the Roman commander who earns Judah's respect. And Finlay Currie shows up as Balthasar, the wise man from Alexandria.The movie is a nice dose of Christianity. In fact, the story pretty much explains what Christianity is all about. How it came to be and why people like it. But the film should still be enjoyable for the non-religious viewer.It's quite an achievement. The epic scale, the huge sets, the action, everything. It has a G rating, but there's a fair amount of blood.BEN-HUR is not one of my personal favorite films, but I did enjoy the story and I can certainly recognize the quality of this enormous production. Recommended. It's something special.",Null,0,2,31 December 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A modern-day fairy tale about love and destiny
","SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the story of a young man in India. All he cares about in the world is a girl. In an effort to find his lost love, he becomes a contestant on the popular game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'. Hoping the girl is out there watching, the boy aims to go as far as he can on the show. As destiny would have it, the questions he's asked can be answered from his experiences as an orphan on the streets of Mumbai. When the uneducated young man reaches the 20-million-rupee question, he is arrested and interrogated on suspicion of cheating.But the money never mattered to the boy. His only motive is to see the girl again. Orphaned as children, Jamal (the boy), Salim (his older brother), and Latika (the girl) were all each other had. They survived many ordeals, being separated, finding each other, and being separated again. Jamal always cared for Latika and is the only person who treats her well. Jamal never forgets about Latika and never gives up on her.I liked the film, though I've heard many criticisms of it. I see SLUMDOG as a love story. Or as another poster suggested, a fairy tale. I do not think the movie was meant to be taken at face value as an it-could-happen-to-you story of rags to riches luck. The money was never important to Jamal. He'd walk away empty-handed if it meant being with Latika.As for its predictability, I didn't have a problem knowing how the love story would end. I wasn't sure if Jamal would win the jackpot, because I knew that it didn't matter either way to him. It's not difficult to predict the ending, but getting there is half the fun.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE cleaned up at the Oscars. It's a very well-crafted film (in terms of cinematography, direction, etc.) and viewers tend to get swept up in the romantic story. Not everybody loved it. (It's not exactly a thriller, it's not action-packed or cerebral, it's not a musical, and, yes, there are factual errors regarding 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'.) But it's a good little love story, if that's what you're looking for. I liked the final 45 minutes the best.",Null,1,3,6 April 2009
Donnie Darko," My simplified take on what happened
","I saw the original version of DONNIE DARKO and enjoyed the air of mysteriousness. However, after finishing the film I still didn't quite grasp what was going on. After reading through countless explanations and discussions on the topic, this is the simplest way I can make sense of it all:***SPOILERS!***Due to some clerical error (caused by God, time-traveling aliens, who knows?) a jet engine was sent 28 days back in time, falling onto the Darko house with no explanation. This was not supposed to happen. The engine didn't belong in the past.What this did was create an unstable universe. In 28 days, when the jet made its flight, the universe would have two identical jet engines existing simultaneously. This would upset the time-space continuum and cause the universe to collapse upon itself.Donnie Darko was enlisted to save the universe. He had to make sure the jet engine in 28 days was sent back in time, thus resolving the time-space error.(Think about this: in the life-cycle of the jet engine, it was built, it flew around a few times, on Oct. 30 it broke off and landed on Oct. 2, where it was retrieved. If Donnie hadn't sent it back in time, the engine would've stayed in Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, while the same engine also existed from crashing on Oct. 2. The one engine would become two duplicate engines for no reason. To keep one engine in the 'life cycle', the Oct. 30 engine had to be sent back in time to become the Oct. 2 engine. Confusing, I know...)Once the jet engine is sent back in time, the universe re-sets from the night the engine crashes. Everything that happened in the 28 days in the unstable universe is wiped away. The universe is stable now because the jet engine has a reason for appearing out of nowhere. That reason is because someone (Donnie) sent it from an alternate timeline. (Before it was just a sloppy goof by some 4th dimensional power, manipulating time-space.)Donnie didn't have to die to save the world, but saving the world likely meant that he would die. (Since the engine crashed into his bedroom.) Donnie was willing to make that sacrifice in order to save the world and to 'save' Gretchen.Frank the bunny is kind of a time-traveling ghost. He's killed by Donnie on Oct. 29, but his ghost goes into the past to guide Donnie on his way.Why was Donnie chosen? Perhaps because he would've been killed in the accident, so he was easy to convince that the universe needed saving. If Donnie had died, maybe they'd have to find someone else to send the jet engine back in time. Or maybe there was something special about Donnie, and he needed to be saved in order for him to right the universe.But in the end, the engine crashes into Donnie's room on Oct. 2. Donnie is killed. Everything from the 28-day alternate timeline seems like déjà-vu. And an unexplainable jet engine is retrieved for further analysis. (Nobody knows what to make of it, but we know it came from another reality.)***END OF SPOILERS***It's still complicated. The Director's Cut supposedly dives much deeper (too deep?) into the sci-fi mythology behind everything. But I think I like the artistry of the original version better. The viewer isn't sure what's going on, even at the end. Is it real? Is he just crazy? What will happen in 28 days? It leaves some things open to interpretation.But I think DONNIE DARKO, in its original form, is a film with almost no answers. The ONLY way for anyone to know what director Richard Kelly was going for is to do research and read interviews, listen to commentaries, dive into the website, watch the Director's Cut, etc. I don't think you can make sense of the movie without an explanation from the filmmakers.The Director's Cut spells everything out, but the film becomes more of a crazy sci-fi flick than a dark mystery. Personally I prefer the original.Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager. He starts getting warnings about the end of the world and believes that he alone has the ability to prevent it. Influenced by an imaginary friend, Donnie's actions become destructive. Meanwhile he meets a girl, goes to therapy, and tries to unlock the mysteries of time travel.The movie is very complicated, and is clearly designed to be so. It's full of layers, from the psychological angle to the Christ-like symbolism. It's one of those movies with dozens of interpretations. A movie that allows people to see what they want to see. Often over-analyzed and possibly over-rated.I think it's a very interesting film, capturing a sense of mystery with storytelling artistry. The film might not 'make sense', but you can tell that it was crafted that way deliberately. The acting is very good and the movie sticks with you days later. I wouldn't call DONNIE DARKO the 'greatest movie ever', like some people, but it certainly is an interesting film.",Null,0,1,12 August 2009
