Ford v Ferrari," A old-fashioned and engaging racing biopic.
","I'm going to be posting the rest of my reviews for 2019 here now that the Academy Award nominations are upon us.Starting off with surprise best picture contender 'Ford v Ferrari'; this is a fascinating and entertaining examination of the real life rivalry between both companies, without resorting to simplicity or being too vague for non-automobile enthusiasts.Christian Bale, in all his British glory, knocked it out of the park as the firey Ford racer Ken Miles, and Matt Damon gives one of his finest recent performances as his sidekick Carroll Shelby. The rest of the cast are also great to see.If you haven't already seen it, definitely race out as soon as it's available to you and check it out.

Blade Runner 2049," One of the best sequels ever, and a Sci-Fi milestone.
","On October 8, 2017; my first viewing of 'Blade Runner 2049' had me at it's mercy. This hotly anticipated sequel to the 1982 classic 'Blade Runner' was met with critical acclaim despite an underwhelming box office run. However; 2049 and it's predecessor, unlike tears in the rain, shall not vanish in Cinematic history.This film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's everything I could hope for in a movie and more. Say what you will about Hollywood churning out sequels to milk off nostalgia; but not all of them are just cheap cash grabs and have stories worth telling, and 2049 is a fine example of that.This has all of the qualities that has made 'Blade Runner' such a treasure among movie buffs and Sci-Fi fans alike, and dials them up to 11. Dazzling and majestic cinematography and special effects- both computer and practically made mixed with dynamic set designs. A bruising and immersive score by one of the best composers, Hans Zimmer, will have you listening to it on repeat.It's artistically inclined storytelling will keeps you hypnotized by every frame, in spite of a slower pace. It's pacing, while some were turned off by it, is similar to films like The Godfather and even the original Blade Runner in how it allows you to soak in all of the awe and detail (not that there's anything wrong with fast paced movies either).This film works as a worthy tribute to the original, while expanding the Blade Runner universe and taking it in bold and powerful directions. It continues to explore the question of what it means to be human in a world that has lost most traces of humanity, which makes it bleak and at times tragic, yet astonishingly beautiful and hopeful. It demands every second of your attention yet rewards it to it's fullest while leaving you hungry for more.All of the performances are pitch- perfect. Ryan Gosling steals the show as Officer K, a detective with an emotional arc unique to Hollywood protagonists. His cold swagger, subtle charm and empathy keeps you rooting for him and waiting to see what he does next. Harrison Ford, in spite of whatever problems he may have had with 'Blade Runner' in the past, is on fire as Rick Deckard. Rick may be jaded and rugged, but he's still the same human character we knew from 1982.All of the key cast, from big stars to smaller characters and surprise cameos, are all a wonder to behold. Arguably the star of the show here is director Denis Villeneuve; who first earned massive recognition for his work on 2010's 'Incendies', has continued to marvel me and gets me excited for 'Dune' in 2020. He directs every scene with precision, energy and sheer passion.I could probably make a long, spoiler-filled essay describing why each scene of this makes it a work of art; but I'll leave it at this- In the year of 2017; there were many great films ('Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', 'Coco'); and arguably 2049 stands among them as champions for why Hollywood continues to do good, whether or not these films made a billion dollars or not.

Alien 3," Not as bad as I was expecting for a maligned threequel.
","I was originally hesitant to view director David Finchers' 'Alien 3' due to varying opinions, a rotten consensus on film critic website Rotten Tomatoes and it being common knowledge the deaths of Hicks and Newt, beloved supporting characters from its' predecessor 'Aliens'. Having recently watched 'Aliens', I sat down and decided to give this threequel a chance.The first five to ten minutes are haunting and are assisted by a score from Elliot Goldenthal, though this sequence is contrived by a gaping plot hole for this scene which also hurts the ending of 'Aliens' (did Ripley check the Sulaco ship for an alien egg?). I'm not usually one to gripe about plot holes, as usually the internal logic of a film or reasonable explanations can prove otherwise; but this was unexplainable.Once we get past that, this is an overall decent film. The prison planet of Fiorina 'Fury' 161 is creative and and lends a gothic atmosphere, unique to the universe of Alien. There are some great moments including a sad but well-crafted funeral scene for Hicks and Newt, some likable characters such as prison doctor Jonathan Clemens, spiritual leader Leonard Dillion (some of his ethics are questionable at best) and Robert Morse who serves Ripley in the climax. Some of the other prisoners are unlikable, but they work in feeding into the moral ambiguity and bleak atmosphere (that would be further capitalized on David's later work to great results). Some of the kills in this film are good but nothing too special, two on par with 'Alien'.The creativity and second half of the film dries up and feels familiar with the original. The ending does however pack a wallop in Ripley's sacrifice to prevent the impending birth of the new Alien Queen, and it nicely ties in with Weyland Yutani being the corporate shadow villain of the first two films.Having subdued expectations for this installment helped with my viewing experience, and I admire David Fincher for pulling through what could've been an even worse film (especially given the studio meddling and butting heads throughout production). 'Alien 3' is what I feel is the 'Batman v Superman' of the series, neither the atrocity nor underrated gem that it's been claimed to be by many. You can take it or leave it.

The Irishman," Martin Scorsese closes out the decade on a high note.
","Given Martin Scorseses' undeniable footprints in the gangster genre among others; it's a no-brainer he'd take on adapting the non-fiction (supposedly) book 'I Heard You Paint Houses' by Charles Brandt, about mafia hitman Frank Sheeran and the crimes he committed for the Bufalino crime family, also tying in with the controversial career of union labor leader Jimmy Hoffa.'The Irishman' nicely works as an encapsulation of various technical and story elements seen in Martin's past films: but also amped up due to its' epic story scope (it spans more time than Scorseses' 'Goodfellas') and de-aging technology given to our three leads Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. While not completely foolproof, it's a bold task and marks progress for this new trend that will hopefully be used wisely in future films (no guarantees though).Robert De Niro (who was unfortunately snubbed by most major awards ceremonies) gives one of his best and more understated performances as Frank Sheeran. The rest of the cast is fantastic; particularly Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa and Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino.The film doesn't quite reach the same level as Martin's other prospects like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Departed'; but it's undeniable ambition and themes will leave you thinking after it's all over, and it should be looked upon as a highlight in the genre.Grade- A",10,1,8,20 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Production issues and years of difficulties don't always lead to a disaster.
","As a Star Wars fan since I was six years old, I've been anxiously anticipating the arrival of 'Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker'. While not as hotly anticipated by others as 2015's episode 'The Force Awakens'; I was going to go in with an open mind, not ready to hate it like some others were (mentioning this is probably going to get me downvoted into oblivion).This just turned out to be decent. The massive scope of filmmaking on display from 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' (both were films that I loved) is present here, along with some incredible and dark imagery.The cast is fantastic as always, including a new supporting character played by Keri Russell. While Princess Leia's inclusion in this film was made difficult by Carrie Fisher's passing, she is done justice and is a solid supporting presence for protagonist Rey.There are some satisfactory moments throughout the movie that help give closure to beloved characters like Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, etc.Like other reviewers have said; it suffers from some too much familiarity, namely the climax. Whereas 'The Force Awakens' integrated classic Star Wars elements into a new and fresh start, there's some treading water here.'The Rise of Skywalker' is a mostly serviceable conclusion, and if it doesn't do it for you then probably 'The Mandalorian' or future projects on Disney+ might restore the hopes of certain fans.* These are mainly my initial thoughts and feelings, but I'll be seeing it again soon to see how things change for me or not. *

Justice League," After decades of comic book history, false starts, and anticipation; does the hype add up?
","I remember myself in 2012 (sometime after the release of The Dark Knight Rises and before Man of Steel) watching speculation, fan trailers, and industry insider news on what will come of what is now DC's ultimate team-up steamroller; or so the makers and Warner Bros. hope it will be.Justice League is a beautiful mess of a film. It mimics some of the best and worst of tropes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe- two after credits scenes, plenty of humor and witty banter between superheroes to satisfy fans who left feeling drained from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and a hopeful outlook for a universe that is repeatedly dipped in potential doom and destruction; much like the reputation of the DC Cinematic Universe itself.More so than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Justice League progresses the events of the DC Cinematic Universe, but more organically along with hints to a hopefully better sequel, and easter eggs that had my inner geek jumping for joy.However; it carries the burden of some set pieces being too hyperactive for most attentive viewers, awkward humor in serious moments, a mostly predictable narrative, and for this being one of the most expensive movies ever made; a villain as forgettable as Steppenwolf is poppycock on part of the writers and Warner Bros. or DC who could excuse a violation like this (especially considering this is a culmination of years of material Warner Bros. has been giddy to adapt, maybe these heroes deserve a worthwhile villain).If you're one looking for another joyride with some of the top dogs of DC Comics, or a fan seeking closure with years of anticipation; this is your excursion. But if you want something more fluid or meaningful, it's variable on how much this will fluster you (if you decide to watch it).

The Butterfly Effect," Retrospective Review- A disgusting, tasteless and pointless film.
","When watching Science-Fiction films about time travel, I can understand this can be a difficult topic to accomplish. Many have done this exceptionally well; such as the Back to the Future Trilogy, 'Source Code', 'Edge of Tomorrow', etc. Among the genre exists the divisive 'The Butterfly Effect'; the 2004 film which was panned by critics but has gained a fanbase since then. It's been hailed as 'mind-blowing' or being an underrated gem. I respect the opinions of those who enjoy films I dislike, but with that being said- for my money this film fails miserably to be either 'mind-blowing' or a masterpiece.'The Butterfly Effect' is a disgusting, tasteless and pointless fim. This 'film' (similar to other excremental movies like the 2007 remake of 'Halloween') is an exercise in dehumanization pornography. It's not as interested in telling a compelling story as it is in degrading it's protagonist, Evan Treborn, and other innocent characters to being nothing more than punching bags for some monstrous caricatures among other horrible events. Even a smaller character like Evan's college roommate turns into an unsympathetic potty mouth in just one scene (for insulting Evan because he has gone through serious childhood trauma, I'll just leave it at that).This childhood trauma and a central event motivate Evan to use his journals to time travel and repent the horrors of his past. He's a sympathetic character with a noble cause, right? Well, Evan himself can't resist joining in some contemptible acts. In one alternate reality, he and his star-crossed lover Kayleigh Miller are attacked by a deranged man from their past; but instead of subduing him and calling the police, Evan subdues then literally kills the man (*cue round of applause*). This sets up for more anguish he has to endure (some of which I can't bring myself to write about), and it goes on and on and on.Even in his past, he encourages one of his friends to set dynamite in a mailbox, resulting in the death of a mother and her baby. I know he was supposed to be a troubled teenager, but I should believe that most rational teenagers and human beings would understand that said act could result in horrible consequences, injury and maybe death. The story circles back to this scene later to give a logical yet disgusting consequence. Otherwise, he's a good character who can be inconsistent (even then, he doesn't deserve any of the pain he's subjected to).Yes, the world is a cruel place; but this is generally not a factor for why certain movies are considered great. Time travel causing world-altering consequences was not a new idea before this film either. Not that there's anything wrong with exploring these ideas, but they've been done better in other films.The absurdity of the screenplay reigns supreme as it takes us on an eye gouging journey of style and oppression over substance. Other offenses include lazy writing, some aggressive editing, ugly cinematography, gratuitous nudity, among other things.I can enjoy movies with dark and bleak themes, when done right, such as 'No Country for Old Men', 'Donnie Darko', 'Minority Report', etc; but 'The Butterfly Effect' pales in comparison to those films due to everything it has to offer, in addition to being incredibly smug and heavy handed. Even decent performances from likable actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart aren't an excuse either.I'm sure there are films that are more vulgar and contemptuous than this; but not many movies I've seen have appalled me as much as what I had to experience in the theatrical cut of this garbagefest, neither what I learned happens in the director's cut.Closing note- One of the only moments of the movie that gives me mild amusement is Evan peacefully eating a cheeseburger in a bar.Grade- F",1,1,6,23 April 2019
Batman Begins," A new beginning that delivers.
","Before the release of Batman Begins in 2005, there was a preconceived notion that comic book movies were undemanding entertainment. Few movies before challenged that (The Crow, Spiderman 2). But Christopher Nolan; fresh from Following, Memento, and Insomnia, started to break the mold with this film.Batman Begins lays the foundation for the trilogy; establishing Bruce Wayne's story, meaningful arcs for supporting characters such as Alfred Pennyworth and Sergeant James Gordon, and Batman's role in Gotham City which is further explored in the sequels. It works as an opening act and a contained story of it's own, which is where many other big budget franchises nowadays fall short.Warner Brothers and the creative team behind The Dark Knight Trilogy appear to have had a stable relationship, allowing enough creative energy while not completely alienating mainstream audiences.The whole cast of The Dark Knight Trilogy is magnificent. The highlights of Begins are Christian Bale; the best on screen Batman/Bruce Wayne, Liam Neeson; who channels his wisdom and anti-hero dark side as Henri Ducard, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox, Gary Oldman as Gordon, Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow; who is efficiently reincorporated into the two sequels. As for Katie Holmes as Rachael Dawes, she's easily replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal but is fairly solid considering her other credentials are not on par with the material here.Some of the shaky camera style can be haphazard during the climax, but the rest of the action is useful in the narrative, and is supplemented by use of miniatures and practical effects.Batman Begins grossing 374 million dollars worldwide was enough to warrant a sequel and gradually a whole monster of it's own. This is complimentary considering the superhero genre was in a farce in the early 2000s, aside from hits such as X-Men and the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films.Being somewhat overlooked compared to it's sequels; this is also the most comic book style of the trilogy, with a Gotham City as grim as Blade Runner (which inspired Nolan during the making of the film). There's also echoes of Richard Donner's 1978 Superman, as both films perfected the hero's origin story on screen.For many, Batman Begins reminds of why we care about Batman. A hero that is reinterpreted throughout history but always stays human. An ordinary man who stands up for everything he holds dearly which includes the good people and salvation of Gotham City.Grade-A+",10,1,2,21 November 2016
1917," One of the best war movies in years.
","Ever since I've watched 'American Beauty', the directorial debut/beginners luck charm of director Sam Mendes; I've trusted the craftmanship of his films to be top-notch even if the stories aren't as strong ('Jarhead', 'Spectre'). How does '1917' currently hold up?This film gives us a fly on the wall perspective of a couple of days during World War One (a war that's rarely touched upon in mainstream films). Two British soldiers Will Schofield and Tom Blake must race against a time to hand-deliver a message to a fellow bettalion in order to save them from impending doom by German enemy forces.This has been touched upon by everyone who knows about this film; but I can't help but mention how making this film look like one take is done masterfully, helping it stand out from other well known/recent war movies.Those who were disappointed by the lack of characterization in 2017's World War Two juggernaut 'Dunkirk'; no need to worry because the two main characters are upheld by their charming chemistry and bravery against all odds. Other ally soldiers, supporting characters and special cameos weave in and out of their journey for a short amount of time; but are unforgettable.Standing among my top 10 for 2019, '1917' is also one of the best of the decade.Grade- A",10,7,10,15 January 2020
The Dark Knight," The epitome of a second act.
","It's amazing that in today's Hollywood, The Dark Knight which contains brutal action violence, crash courses in law and justice logisitics, themes that joint comic book fantasy with real world darkness, authentic filmmaking, and the casting of Heath Ledger which repeled fans; it's the highest grossing juggernaut of 2008 and a classic in the Superhero genre. Does it still hold up?-In my opinion, absolutely yes.The film takes a familiar concept and twists it into something distinctive from other superhero films. The struggle between the Police and the Mob is excellently crafted and manages to never be boring. Bruce Wayne's story arc, though more subdued in comparison to the other two films in the series, is meaningful. His morals and viewpoints he channeled in Batman Begins are challenged to the Max, and he doesn't give up until the end. Maggie Gyllenhaal is fantastic as Rachel Dawes; as her character also serves the story, as she is fighting to preserve the Legal foundation of Gotham City. She's not a stereotypical damsel in distress (looking at you Mary Jane Watson). Aaron Ekhart gives his best performance as Harvey Dent. The buildup to his transformation into Two- Face is fascinating and tragic in all the right ways. James Gordon, like Batman, is driven to do dirty work in the name of virtuousness. The ending is beautifully dark and leaves the door open for more.Everything that has been said about Heath Ledger's portrayal as The Joker has been said, which is what makes him my favorite movie villain; the embodiment of pure and nihilistic Pandemonium. The score that plays in his scenes-'Why So Serious?', is chilling and petrifying. This film serves as a tribute to Heath as he proved himself as a substantial actor before the making of this film with the likes of Brokeback Mountain.I've loved this film since it came out, and all of this is why I believe this film and the rest of the Trilogy will be remembered fondly.

Snowden," One of the most important movies of the year, and rightfully so.
","In this politically heated year of 2016, the release of two films give voice to American heroes-13 Hours, Michael Bay's film about the battle of Benghazi; and Snowden, about controversial whistleblower Edward Snowden who is currently a fugitive in hiding. I am proud to say that Oliver Stone, of Platoon and JFK fame, delivers justice to the story; and it's one of the best movies of 2016.Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays Edward Snowden. In two or three scenes; Snowden is strapped to a high tech lie detector, he is asked the question 'Is America the greatest country in the world?' to which he replies yes. This is what drives Edward throughout the movie, as he transitions from Special Forces dropout to CIA computer analyst. He works on various assignments across the country and learns the means that the Government uses to intrude on the privacy of the American people. He also has a relationship with Lindsay Mills; who loves social media but is also affected and disturbed by Edward's paranoia and resentment towards the Government. She's also the most static character in the film, and she should've been given closure considering her real life counterpart is standing by Snowden today.The ending is spectacular and delivers it's message without being overly sentimental. All the important characters are relevant and brilliantly acted by the likes of Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Tom Wilkinson, Zachary Quinto, etc. The film features excellent cinematography with good use of color schemes in various scenes to make it's universe feel like our own.Snowden is a thrilling and entertaining Drama that is crucially important for people living in America today. Always questioning authority, and standing up for what's right.Grade-A.",9,20,28,3 October 2016
Joker," DC Comics based film ups their game for 2019 awards season.
","2005 saw the release of 'Batman Begins', which reintroduced Cinema to the caped crusader by going to his genesis. This year in 2019, we have received it's evil twin, 'Joker'- an origin story for the clown prince of crime that is incendiary and riveting. It only shows so much but sticks with you in the same way that other controversial films like 'Fight Club' and 'Natural Born Killers' did for the audiences who beared witness to them.Joaquin Phoenix, like previous Batman star Christian Bale in many of his roles, dedicated himself to the title role by losing 52 pounds and immersed himself mentally to bring us the best incarnation of the character since Heath Ledger back in 2008.Much has been discussed about the films' influences ('Taxi Driver', 'The King of Comedy'), but Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver manage to carve an entrancing narrative that taps into comics mythology surrounding our title character and his eventual adversary, Batman, without being too chained to it.The film does struggle in its' second half as it becomes repetitive with some overuse of montages. The story manages to overcome this and brilliantly pays off by the end.This is definitely a worthwhile and refreshing film that takes a noteworthy spot in a year of comic book escapism.

It Chapter Two," Flawed yet semi-satisfying
","I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book 'It' back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.Now our favorite Losers club are back to face Pennywise again in 'It: Chapter Two'. Adding up all of that and that this is my second most anticipated mainstream film of the year, does it live up to the hype? Well, somewhat. It's an imperfect but solid sequel.In spite of a three hour runtime it kept my attention for the entire ride. Like 'Chapter One'; it's wonderfully shot (with effective use of sepia tone colors) and the editing and scene transitions are eye popping. Many of the dialogue and scares are cleverly written (a scene at a restaurant is a highlight).In spite of an often unsettling plot, there is plenty of levity to be found here. It unfortunately suffers from inappropriate timing with many of the jokes, causing the film to play like a dark comedy. Half of the frightening and dramatic moments are finished by gags and one-liners. There is one scary sequence that really works until it's ruined by a joke straight out of a Deadpool film.The pacing is troubling at times; since some of the opening introductions are rushed, while certain flashbacks to the younger versions of the Losers Club could've been shorter. This makes the narrative not feel as fresh or as fulfilled compared to the first film.It's most accomplished at being an emotionally fulfilling journey for the Losers club. This is sharpened by the adult actors being dead ringers for the kids from the original; including the main highlight Bill Hader- an instant classic as Richie, as he combines the best of his talent from 'Saturday Night Live' with intense urgency to best serve the idea of 'What would Richie from It be like if he grew up?'If you're looking for a good cinematic start for this Halloween season, and something to bring you back all the feels from Chapter One from September 2017; Chapter Two is a somewhat messy but nicely done job.

The Dark Knight Rises," Everything Comes Together.
","I could maybe write a whole novel expressing my admiration for The Dark Knight Trilogy, and what it means to me as a lover of movies. That culminates with The Dark Knight Rises, and I'll explain why.Christopher Nolan and company are at the top of their game. The plot is engaging and intricately detailed. Another superhero third installment, Spider-Man 3, didn't work is because it's plot was scattershot and didn't juggle it's dozen story lines with any good payoff. The Dark Knight Rises is the opposite of that. All of the story arcs and characters are tied together neatly: The Dent Act that lead to the incarceration of the mob after the fallout of The Dark Knight. After the Dent Act makes Batman unnecessary; Bruce Wayne attempts to move on by starting the Fusion Reactor project, then shuts it down which creates financial burdens on Gotham City, which ties in with the lower class siding with Bane and rising up against the rich. Bane crashes the plane in the opening in order to capture nuclear physicist Dr.Pavel and use him in his plan to destroy Gotham City. John Blake finds a dead child from the Orphanage that he attended when he was younger, which leads to the discovery of Bane's Underground Army. The meaning of Batman as an icon of hope which is visually represented by the Chalk symbol drawn by an Orphan in the beginning of the film, and John Blake during the insurrection in Gotham City; and the fire that Batman lights up in his return, which inspires the Police force to fight Bane, including Peter Foley-the Police Commissioner who turns from being stubborn and ego-driven to dying honorably on the battlefield in the climax. Selina Kyle steals Bruce Wayne's fingerprints to be used for the Stock Exchange robbery that bankrupts Bruce Wayne; which triggers Batman's return in an awesome chase scene between him, Bane's men, and the GCPD. Selina Kyle steals the Pearls that belonged to Bruce Wayne's Mother, and wears them at the end when she resides in Florence with Bruce Wayne. Batman learns that vigilantism is still necessary even when the GCPD had conquered organized crime, which is why he gives the USB drive from the Stock Exchange Robbery to Lucius Fox instead of the Police (he didn't trust them out of fear of Bane's infiltration). So there must always be a Batman to fight threats more than the police can handle. This ties in with him choosing John Blake to be his successor at the end (Source-IMDB FAQ).When Bane breaks Batman's back, it's not just fan-service; it's meant to bring Batman down to ground zero and emphasize on how broken he is physically. This is why we cheer for Bruce Wayne when he escapes the Pit, because this is a film that's not just about heroes in cheesy costumes punching out bad guys. The genre thrills and the themes all coincide together. All of the cast is sensational including Christian Bale in his best performance as Batman. The film is visually supreme, tightly paced, well edited, and Hans Zimmer's incredible and magnetic soundtrack is the best of the Trilogy. The Dark Knight Rises was named one of the best films of 2012 by the American Film Institute. It's considered by many to be one of the best superhero films of all time. In today's Hollywood where endless sequels, reboots, and derivative cash-grabs are being churned out; Christopher Nolan makes films that bring in the old and new. His unique vision has appealed to over hundreds of film lovers. This film to me is The Godfather Part 2 of the series. Even if it's not as famous as it's predecessor; it's bigger and broader in the vein of a Historical Epic, and makes the story all the more complete. It's the best conclusion to a Film Trilogy I've ever seen.Grade-A+",10,0,1,17 December 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A flawed but bittersweet and worthy tribute to Comic Book monuments.
","Controversy is Zack Snyder's middle name. He's stayed in his comfort zone for most of his career, but is one of the most visually enticing directors of this generation. Bringing Batman and Superman together on the big screen was no easy task, so backlash was inevitable. Does it deserve the hate?-Not exactly.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is deeper than what the average comic book fan and moviegoer would be lead to believe by the marketing. The question surrounding Superman's relevance is conveyed through a series of scenes ranging from media and news interviews with famous figures like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Nancy Grace, and Superman saving people from natural disasters. Natural disasters take another form in this film. Jonathan Kent speaks to Clark Kent from the grave about how actions have unintended consequences dating back to his childhood farm life, which humanizes Jonathan and motivates Clark to return as Superman and sacrifice himself in defeating Doomsday. Jonathan's prediction about the world's love and hate dynamic with Clark is brought to the forefront; which makes him one of the most relevant characters in the film despite only being visible for one scene. On the other hand, Martha Kent is morally blind as she tells Clark- 'You don't owe this world a thing, you never did.' Many criticize Zack Snyder's treatment of women in his films, but for me this is the worst you can give to a character that is Superman's mother, a role model if you will. Ben Affleck for me is the third best cinematic incarnation of Batman behind Kevin Conroy and Christian Bale. Riffing traces from Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Christian Bale's older and jaded Bruce Wayne from The Dark Knight Rises (among other story elements), he takes it further. He's a nihilistic, prescription pill addicted, nightmare haunted muscle compound detective who leaves behind a trail of guilt free murder in nearly every action set piece. When you also consider he's been fighting crime in Gotham City for 20 years, he gives The Punisher and Daniel Craig's James Bond a run for their money. It's Superman though who brings out the light in him after he nearly becomes a shadow of his parents nameless killer by trying to annihilate Superman with a Kryptonite spear. In not killing Superman, saving Martha, and avoiding the temptation to brand Lex Luthor in prison; he makes himself a more human character. Lex Luthor has one of the most intricate evil plans in recent history; from obtaining Kryptonite from the Indian Ocean and transporting it on the ship labeled The White Portuguese, using anti-Superman activist Wallace Keefe as a Trojan Horse to frame Superman for bombing the capitol, using General Zod's body to obtain access to a Kryptonian ship and Frankenstein Doomsday into existence to kill his beloved arch-nemesis. On top of all that; he's one of the biggest puppet masters in the DC Cinematic Universe thus far-taking lives of criminals to drive Batman and Superman to quarrel and discovering Steppenwolf, the villain of Justice League coming in November. It's bizarre when his cartoonish quirks/personality and somewhat vague motivations don't match the evil deeds he's accomplished; but bring some self awareness and humor to this grim and monstrous film. Lex loosing his hair at the end in prison may hopefully be a step towards him becoming more scary; or more obnoxious down the road.As for the ending, Superman death makes sense in the overall context of this first phase of DCCU films. However the iconic Doomsday storyline from the comics is disposed of callously and robs any further suspense for Superman's fate in future installments unless Lois Lane dies.Is DC rushing their cinematic universe? Not exactly. The idea of a tug of war between Batman and Superman bringing out other metahumans makes complete sense in paving way for more adventures, while not resorting to complete Marvel formula. Could it have been more self contained?- More than likely. My only real issue may seem like a nitpick but Lex Luthor designing logos for Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman is completely BS. The filmmakers of the future DCCU if they prevail must remember to treat their audiences with respect. I also embrace the idea of DCCU flicks using different tones and styles; even if not executed perfectly, will help give contrast to Marvel's fun but formulaic railroad track.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will be remembered for many things. Thousands of Fanboy dreams of two titans coming together for the first time on the silver screen, being recognized as either a pile of rubbish that resembles the worst of comic book films like Catwoman, or a daring and misunderstood masterpiece with something to say about it's genre. I lean somewhere closer towards the latter. Only time and the outcome of 2017's DC dropoffs will tell. Until then, I stand in defense of this film as a flawed masterpiece while not quite ranking it in my top 10 Superhero films of all time.Grade-B+",7,0,1,10 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New Hope-New standards for Cinema.
","Before the release of A New Hope, Science Fiction films were in a strange position. After the box office bombing of 2001 A Space Odyssey, George Lucas worked tooth and nail to ensure the original Star Wars reached theaters-to biblical proportions. Ushering Sci-Fi into the mainstream, Star Wars is ingrained into almost every detail of pop culture. But it's always important to evaluate the films on their own merits. I ask that question as someone who's been a fan since childhood.Even today, this is an impressive film that can inspire awe in young children and film fans even today. The characters- Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2; all blend together brilliantly with their chemistry, dialogue, and backstories. The epic final confrontation between Obi-Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader leaves the audience wanting more. This all segways into a triumphant ending.The action and effects are a wonder to behold. Perhaps the most challenging production of George Lucas's career, the effort pays off and is transparent on screen. The space battles, location sets, sound, and production designs were awarded with 6 Oscars as a cherry on top.Overall, Star Wars has pretty much changed the world forever (for better and worse); a Sci-Fi magnum opus at the highest order.

Spectre," Traditional Bond at it's best.
","As a fan of James Bond since childhood, I recognize that a majority of the films are fun escapism; but various tones with different actors and themes that reflect their respective time periods help to give an interesting variety. The 21st Century has seen layered storytelling in blockbuster franchises receive critical acclaim and box office rewards, which I've gone into some detail about in my other reviews. With two hits and one film that's been dragged through the mud under Daniel Craig's sleeve; Spectre while positively received by some fans has received backlash by others.Putting aside all of this and glaring comparisons to Mission: Impossible- Rogue Nation; Spectre is a strong chapter in the Bond series. Sam Mendes is one of many directors who has gone from thought provoking Dramas, to translating action scenes with near perfection and being able to handle increasing budgets. Skyfall and Spectre are neck and neck with the scope of their set pieces but are just as entertaining.Almost every scene in Spectre is brewing with energy, whether it's the gunfights, chase scenes or the witty banter between characters including Bond and Q; the film is almost never dull.Spectre makes a controversial yet bold attempt to tie in Daniel Craig's previous adventures into this installment, and for me it mostly works. Allusions to the Patriot Act and the Illuminati are present with Blofeld's master scheme to impose drone surveillance on all of Great Britain, and possibly the world. Secondary villain C's motivations are clear as he yearns for security for the world and believes secret agents are outdated which allows him to be manipulated by Spectre, and his arrogance to get the best of him along with his rivalry with M.Lea Seydoux, fresh off Blue Is The Warmest Colour, is charming and whip-smart as Madeleine Swann, a love interest that surprisingly works. Growing up with an assassin for a Father, she truly understands Bond; which results in her confessing her love for him as he's strapped into a classic torture chair routine by Blofeld.Mr. White is one of the most meaningful characters in the series. He also comes full circle in Spectre; he's not a cheap plot device. His disenchantment with Spectre being involved in sex trafficking pushes him to have Bond protect Madeline; somewhat redeeming both Bond and White.The only deficiency I wish was corrected regards Blofeld's backstory. How did he come to be the overlord of Spectre? How did it tie in with his grievance towards Bond for stealing his father's love? A few flashbacks could've fixed this.So while not everyone agrees with Sam Mendes voyage into more traditional Bond formula; it's surely one of the most entertaining and substance filled Bond adventures yet, that farewells Daniel Craig who is one of a kind in the actors who've gotten a turn at one of Pop Culture's most iconic characters.Grade- B+",8,2,4,5 February 2017
The Breakfast Club," One of the best coming-of age films ever made.
","Truly great films about youth, and especially high school, are a commodity. It's rare that I'm deeply impressed by one nowadays ('Lady Bird' and 'Eighth Grade' being notable exceptions for the 2010's), so I decided to go back to Generation Z's favorite decade and finally see 'The Breakfast Club' for myself. What a truly remarkable time capsule this is.Hilarious and deeply moving, but also naturally acted and plotted without giving into overbearing sentimentality or too many of the silly trappings of the genre. For my money my viewing of this was definitely the opposite of the saying 'Don't believe the hype.'
