Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holme as the Victorian Iron Man 3
","Jeez! The repeating of the violent scenes where Holmes would envision what he would do and then the actual fight, was very confusing. Deleting the duplicate scenes would have made the film have been shorter. Then the munitions factory, what was that all about? Slow motion to distraction, what did this add to the film? Not much. The weapons, such as the gas piston type of weapon used by Watson during this part of the film was not in type of successful production till 1910 or so. The pistols where not in production till later as well. I only mention this because the pistol in production looked much more interesting and showed the general laziness about the writers then anything else. If the film was about a consulting detective then how did Holmes get the job? In any Holmes story he has to meet with the client, it is a basic rule of the Sherlock Holmes style. Consultants don't just jump into the job they have to think and review. Good pieces and actors where the wife of Watson and Mycroft, the movie was worth just for them. Professor Moriatory was well played and one wished for more of him. Downey acted well, just not as Sherlock Holmes and was fun to hang with. Jude was a good Watson, but without a Holmes. Mrs. Hudson, why not just have Paltnow take the part. Then it would have been truly Victorian Iron Man. The movie was enjoyable but it was not a Sherlock Holmes movie in any sense. It was fun to see the question mark at the end, but really did we need it? No. The deviation from the historical accuracy made the film more expensive to make and took away from the detective component. I am glad to have watched this on pay per view and not paid 15 us dollars to see it. Best I can say is that it too long for no reason but not a waste of time.",5,1,2,7 July 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," On long flight, it was more fun to watch back of seat in front of me instead of watching this movie
","Seriously, this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen. The dialog was disconnected, the characters were just poor.Why was this movie made? Why didn't Stevie boy do more work on War Horse? Why was this green lighted? Who knows, but if you watch this movie you will wish that you did something else. Seriously, I simply blew off my 6 bucks on this movie and switched to Law and Order that I had already seen with commercials over this movie.Bottom line: Appolo 18 was a much better film, but a long shot. Casino Joack much better.However, this movie may help you if you are in the hospital, as it can act as a pain killer and help you with your pain.Don't watch this film. Watch Wild, Wild, West before you watch this one.",2,3,6,25 March 2012
Watchmen," Watchmen: Don't watch
","The graphic novel was awesome. The movie sucked. Like the awful movie 'The Spirit' this movie was a shock to the system. Using the graphic novel about 98% of the time means you miss an important part of the novelization. Instead of wasting time showing a meat cleaver in a bad guys head, the time could have been better used creating a livable fantasy world. More focus on the love story between the Night Owl and Spectra would have made the movie somewhat more likable.Having a cadence of: Depressing environment, depressing conversation, depressing murder or mayhem in a movie gets depressing. If you are going to use the graphic novel, then make sure to use the elements of the novel. This means ALL elements, don't leave out the seemingly minor characters that make the novel work. In a movie death is not a transition, it is a period of a sentence. If you use death as a transition, then the normal flow of a movie is broken. This is the case with Watchmen.If you want to see the movie fine, get it on Netflix. It rivals Batman and Robin for lack of character. In the same way that the Psycho Movie was redone, using Hitchcock's story board and the remake didn't work, neither did Watchmen the movie.Save your money, buy the graphic novel, which really is a great book.",2,4,8,25 July 2009
21," 21 = zero
","OK, it's MIT and there are really hot looking girls? The girls of MIT might be good looking, but generally they aren't able to dress up like models. One down for 21.Then, the real story was much more interesting then this one.Kevin Spacey as a professor, not bad.Casino's security folks? Bad choice, the actors chosen were a little too nice and pretty. They seemed to play at only a few casio's, well there a lot of casinos in Las Vegas, they could have switched casinos for 17 times 3 different ones every weekend and not run out.Hotel scenes? OK, so they are worried about the money and then blow it on really expensive suites? Why bother, you are only going to sleep there.The movie could have cut out 30 minutes easily and told the story better. Next movie like this, you might want to use USC students to do the production, they would do a better job.Oh well, I watched it all, sure glad I didn't pay for it.",4,1,1,28 December 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," It is either horror movie or a horrible movie
","OK, film violates the 3 rule, that is: do something 3 things and no more. The battle of witches versus Hansel and Gretel, seemed to follow exactly the same process. One would think that H & G would have a little debrief before the next fight and figure out that they would get beat up if they do... whatever they did against the witches in the individual fight.This is a beautifully shot film and the editing is tight with good make-up, special effects and costume. But...the story was poorly thought out and the speaking parts were confusing.Key mistakes: Old guy helping out the H&G pair is forced to shoot himself by a witch. This added nothing to the overall story, except it added about a minute of runtime. H&G get absolutely flogged by the bad guys, and then are all fixed up in only a few hours. Really? And where did the insulin come from? Did Hansel have be shown giving himself a shot through his clothes (a great infection vector)? Really, again didn't add anything to the movie.If you watch this movie, catch on Netflix when it hits there, you might want to be doing a jigsaw puzzle or something while watching so it doesn't seem like a total waste of time.Finally, the weapons were really confusing. Why a multiple shot cross bow with a weird shotgun, then cartridge shotgun, then a machine gun. Then the final scene is just mess.But it is better then 'Ted'. You won't throw up or die watching it.",5,2,6,6 February 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Hulk was smart to stay out of this movie
","Go ahead you will want to see this movie, then you will regret it.
There are three movies going on in this one movie. Trying to tie together threads, Thor here, Guardians there, Captain America over here, Ironman over there. Rerun bad guy type from last Guardian movie. 
Go ahead waste your money on this, likely you have looked forward to this movie. 
**SPOILER SPOILER**
The main battle scene: Horrible. The battle scene looked like it was left over from the 'Phantom Menace'. Frankly, if you are in Africa, and you are a rich country, why not call South Africa to send some of their close support aircraft. Pretty sure the South African Gripen's would have dealt with the interstellar scum pretty quickly. The superheros and the Africans all seemed to be using military tactics without noticing that WW1 and WW2 had produced the concept of aircraft that deliver large bullets and bombs. 
Other items about the battle scenes just pulled me out of the picture time and time again.
There is little room anymore in this franchise to recover. 
End of spoiler about battle scene.Better than Birdman, about the same as Batman VS. Superman
To long by 40 minutes at least, many of the scenes simply were not needed. Dialog was generally limited to a few words, mildly realistic but annoying 
Moody and excessive CGI. 
Frankly Robot Chicken would do a better job. 
On the other hand Disney has done a great job of marketing. 
And yes you will watch it on your home system feeling mild boredom with the whole thing.",1,9,18,4 August 2018
2012," Emotional, but unsatisfying
","I liked Independence Day, and expected some of the same kind of fun out of this movie. Didn't get it. Lot's of special effects and emotional playing around, but it didn't tie down the idea. After spending a lot of time on developing an interesting idea, the movie fails to generate the archetypical ending of 'Worlds in Collision' that is: People get left behind and the Captain of the ship is the guy in charge, not civilians.Spoiler here: An absolute deadline is coming, and you are the captain of a ship that has to make sure that the people on board are safe. An emotional passenger suddenly decides that you, as the captain, have to do something that can threaten the entire ship. You as a captain violate your checklist and do what the emotional passenger says to do. Umm, no you don't. It is the ship first, boarded souls second and forget about thirds. By failing to accept the natural momentum of events, the movie fails to show what humanity is all about: Survival.If the writers hadn't tried to load the movie with phony emotional decisions, decisions that in real life would have ended in failure. As a result the movie lost it's center, that is: Hard Decisions that have to be made at the end of civilization.Instead the movie becomes: Let's all play nice and it will all work out.Sorry, physics, gravity and command decisions don't work that way during times of duress. With 15 minutes before an event that isn't well modeled is going to occur, is not a time to have to deal with unruly mobs.So basically 2012 becomes a myth that demonstrates what is wrong with California and the United States: The inability to make hard decisions.The movie run time could have been trimmed by 30 minutes if this concept had been followed, and it would have been more satisfying to listen to the conversations after the mob was destroyed.Confusing discussions via video links with leaders also lead to confusion, and the emotional President scenes could have been cut with no harm to the confused story in the film.Lot's of good flight scenes, really fun family, and good emotional roller coaster.Finally, if it is the end of the world, I would take higher ratio of women to men then that which the film chose. Waaay to many males...",3,1,2,25 November 2009
Sherlock Holmes," The Plot beats the special effects in Sherlock Holmes
","Wow, the plot for Sherlock Holmes could have been used in a movie without the special effects and the almost annoying fight sequences.This movie was a fun house of plotting, special effects, and Downey channeling various actors. Jude Law as well as the supporting cast did their job quite well, I have never seen Jude Law act in anything that I liked, so this was surprise.The plot could have gotten out of hand, ala Wild, Wild, West, but it didn't. I won't spoil the secret, but I thought that Sherlock was going to go off the track of being a realist.Robert Downey channels Charlie Chaplin in few scenes, watch for the quiet moments and in one of the fight scenes. He also needs to send a check to Dustin Hoffman for stealing his persona in the scene where Sherlock states he is a professional while handcuffed to the bed. Other scenes shows that Downey understands the physical science of Hollywood and flows with it. Jude Law and the two female roles struggle with the physics in their movements, Jude often forgets he has a bad leg and it shows in some of the scenes, nothing major.Speaking of physics, the movie does use 'Hollywood' physics in a few scenes, not in the annoying way that most movies lately do, but they are there. For instance, a massive object like a ship that is propped up by poles isn't going to slide down a 'way', it is going to fall on it's side. But the scene works, and no one except mechanical engineers will likely notice the physic problems.Spoiler: There is one scene where the 'Hollywood' science breaks down, Holmes holds up a rat tail that indicates that a gas will contain arsenic (arsine). Arsine, according to the plot, will flow into a chamber with good guys and bad guys in it. Then a little later he states that the bad guys have received an immunity to arsenic. Good luck on that one, there isn't an antidote to arsenic, if you are poisoned with arsenic, you will likely die. However, the concentration would have to be very high to kill instantly, in reality, it would take up to 3 days for arsine to kill the people in the chamber. But it isn't noticeable and certainly the plot wouldn't work without the bad science, I didn't think about it till I left the theater.Villain's machinery: Poorly designed, lot's of failure points, but fits into the plot and flow of the movie nicely, unlike the awful ending in a movie like Wild, Wild, West.Also, in a world that isn't used to what happens when you close the flue on a coal fire place, which Holmes does in one scene, the smoke accumulation seems OK. But the fact is that smoke goes up and doesn't lay along the floor. In the movie, the smoke is clearly made up of either a software particle cloud, water or dry ice which lays on the floor and then moves up. If it was a software particle cloud, hopefully the special effects people will fix that in future productions.The special effects and background had the feeling that it was similar to the 'Secret Adventures of Jules Verne', not a bad thing. The problem with that type of 'blue screen' is that the actors have to be darkly lite, even in scenes that they should have angle lights. This seems to be lazy work on the part of post production.Sound was well done, but loud, I'll be wearing ear protection to any movies that I go to the theater this year. The subsonic sounds were intense in the early part of the movie, so make sure you go before you go, if you get my meaning.Overall, you need to see this movie in the theater, it is worth it!",9,6,12,27 December 2009
Flight," Good performance by all, enjoyable film.
","So you are a pilot and 51 flying a regional jet, sort of the last in the hierarchy of pilots, what is your life like? This is one view of the pilot's life. Sadly, if you flying a Regional Jet, your stay-over hotel isn't usually this nice.Couple of items that could have been better: Why the Cessna 172 and not a Cessna 152 Aerobat, that would explain why Whip knew how to fly inverted. Not all pilots know how to fly inverted, in fact very few do. The hotels were a little high price for a regional pilot and crew.Things that the film got right: Horizontal Stabilizer causes the exact situation portrayed! Very good job.Things the film got wrong: If one of the pilots smells of Gin, the other officer is honor bound to report him at the time of recognizing the issue. That's OK though. Also, there are no co-pilots they are first officers for cockpit control situation. But so what, minor detail.Overall, the technical detail was close enough to reality that it didn't move into 'Airplane' situations. Do not see this movie if drug use bothers you, there is a lot of drug use with needles, cocaine and so forth. So beware. Also Christians are shown respect and made fun of at the same time, but if you are a Christian you are use to the poor portrayals by Hollywood. So shake off the poor representation of Christians and view the film as a whole.In the end it is a well done Hollywood film with death at the beginning of the film and redemption at the end. Nicely done.",8,3,6,2 November 2012
The Great Gatsby," Great Gatsby: Good movie to watch
","Wow, I was ready to hate this movie and spoiler alert: It was good. Initially I caught it on a flight from D.C. and napped through parts but was impressed. And that is important as I was on an American Airline 737 with the little tiny screens a few rows up. So when I got home I watched it that night on my big screen and was WOW'd! OK, McGuire was a little off as Nick Carraway, and Daisy was not quite the girl I would have selected, Mia Farrow was so good in the last one. But no one asked me to produce, direct or cast the film and it worked as an integrated unit.I usually do not give anyone a break (see my other reviews), and I am not giving the production a break here. There were definite issues with the rendering into 2D, the background looked more unreal than the unreal look the production was attempting. The first 20 minutes was my favorite with the character animation and speed. The party scenes were my favorite. And the road racing scenes not so good. Finally, I came to the end of the film thinking that maybe it was just a story written by a drunk. And guess what, it was.",10,0,2,22 September 2013
