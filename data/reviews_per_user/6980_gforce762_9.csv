Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A complete waste of time.
","This is my second comment (First one was deleted by an IMDb administrator for reason(s) I have yet to ascertain.) Anyway. This movie is funny if: a. You think that degrading women is funny. b. You think that the sight of 2 naked men romping around a hotel room and lobby is funny. c. You think that comparing Jews to cockroaches is funny. d. You think that changing the words to the National Anthem to represent a country that does not even exist is funny. e. You think that defecating in a plastic bag and bringing it to the dinner table is funny. If you think that any of acts/scenes are funny, give you a chuckle or have you rolling on the floor laughing, then this is the movie for you. I was repulsed by this movie. In fact, it has replaced Napoleon Dynamite as the 'worst movie that I have had the displeasure of sitting through'. I give Borat a 1 only because I cannot give it a lower rating.",1,6,11,16 July 2007
United 93," Powerful
","Just about everyone on earth knows of the events of September 11, 2001.Flight 93 - Powerful? Yes Topical? Yes Emotional? Very Controvesial? Definitely! As I sat in the theater waiting for the movie to start, I was wondering if I was going to be able to sit through this. The events depicted are still relatively fresh in my memory and the collective memory of the world. I was wondering if the American public, and the world was ready to see such an event unfold. Remember that it was 20 to 30 years after the end of World War II that the first batch of 'graphic' movies about it (The Longest Day, Battle of the Bulge, Patton, Midway) started appearing on the screen. And it was much longer before the likes of Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Band of Brothers really hit home. While the Vietnam War films (Appocalype Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket etc) took less time from the end of the war to hit the screen, the impact of those events for the people who were there was no less powerful.The film makers have taken very few known facts (no one will ever be 100% certain of what happened on the plane before the crash), aided by real people who were in the Air Traffic Control Centers, the family members of the crash victims and various news reports to make a very powerful, very real version of what MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. Since, as I stated that no one will ever be 100% certain of what EXACTLY happened, this is probably the closest thing that we will ever get to witness.The screenwriters and director have taken real people, with real emotions and feelings and turned them into real people. The fear and horror on the plane is real and raw, yet not overdone in any manner.You see that some people in shock, some in anger and some in fear as they do not know exactly what is going on.They hear (through the use of air to ground telephones) of the other planes hitting the towers.On ground, you see the disbelief, confusion and shock by the air traffic controllers, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the military liaison officers.By attempting to overpower the hijackers and land the plane, the passengers of Flight 93 are not trying to be heroes, but are trying to save their own lives.The questions remains - can a hero someone who tries something and fails? Is trying to save yourself and others heroic or simple human nature? Those are questions that I do not have the answer for. Maybe none of us do...............",9,0,2,2 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Rousing fun
","A Disney ride and now a movie. Alright, alright, alright - rode it, seen it, done it, big deal. Not quite with this movie. Set right out the attraction at Walt Disney World, this movie has the 'feel' of the ride done to a tee. The sets are wonderfully brought to life and if you look carefully, you will see several aspects of the ride in the movie, most notably the scene where the dog has the key to jail cell and the prisoners just can't get the dog to bring them the key. Best quote in the movie - 'Jack Sparrow, you are the worst pirate I've ever heard of.' 'Ah, but you have heard of me.' Makes the movie, shows what kind of character Jack Sparrow is and what kind of actor Johnny Depp is to pull it off. Go rent it, go buy it. Just go see it.",9,0,2,23 December 2004
Batman Begins," A movie worthy of the series
","Let the debate begin. First off, I consider myself a 'semi-serious' Batman fan. I loved 2 out of the first 4 movies in the cycle that began with 'BATMAN'. I have to admit that George Clooney is the worst Batman ever and that my impression of 'Batman & Robin' was that he has done what no villain could do - he killed Batman!! Now back to the present and Batman Begins - and what a beginning it is! Everyone knows the story, Bruce Wayne's parents are killed before his eyes, he grows up to become Batman, etc, etc, etc. This movie shows the beginning: the anger (at himself and the world as a whole, so it seems); the training (hey you just don't fall off a building and hope that you land right); the costume (not exactly something you can buy at Walmart or Target); and the weapons (mostly hand made or modified from their original intent). This movie fills in a lot of the 'early years' and shows not just how but WHY Bruce Wayne became (becomes?) Batman. The movie is more character driven that any other Batman movie, but that is what makes it so special. A winner.",9,0,1,5 July 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting
","First off, one must remember that this is FICTION, MADE-UP STUFF, NOT BASED IN FACT!!! Rant over. I think that the best way to describe this movie, and the book for that matter, is for the creation of a new category called SPECTION, short for Speculative Fiction. Hey, we already have Science Fiction, Historical Fiction, Romantic Fiction, etc, etc, etc, so why not SPECTION? I have read the book, and had my own ideas of what each character should be. The casting was almost perfect in every way, although I don't think that Tom Hanks would have been my first choice for the Robert Langdon role. What you take out of this movie has a lot to do with your personality going into it. Are you going to change your mind about Faith, The Church, or History because you saw this movie, I highly doubt it. The book, and this movie caused quite a stir amongst Catholic Church officials, and readers/moviegoers around the country and the world. I, for one, do not see what all the fuss is about. Could it be possible that Jesus Christ was a mortal man and not the Son of God? Sure it is. It is just as likely that He was the Son of God and is/was(?) immortal and all-powerful. No one can ever be sure. You have your beliefs, I have mine. It is impossible for me to understand your beliefs, you to understand mine. I will not attempt to change your beliefs, and I do not want you to try to change mine. Anyway,back to the movie. The sets were spectacular. I do not know if they were filmed at the Louvre, I think that they were, but I now feel like I have been there. The Paris scenes were some of the most breathtaking I have had the pleasure of seeing in a movie in quite some time. The movie was a well made adaptation of the book, true to form in almost every aspect. I highly recommend this movie, not because of the 'controversial' content, but because it is an 'intelligent' movie, a welcome change from the mindless 'popcorn' fare that usually inhabits the theater at this time of year.",9,0,1,26 June 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun
","OK, check your brain at the door. That is the best advice I can give on this movie. Yes it has action, humor, intrigue and is plenty of fun to watch - eye candy for all types of people, men (Miss Jolie), women (Mister Pitt) action types (plenty of fights, gun play and car chases), humor types (Vince Vaughn, although I wish he had a bigger role) and just about everyone else. Let's face it though, some of this stuff is WAY OVER THE TOP!!! The believability factor is about a 1, starting with the whole premise. A killer is married to another killer and neither one knows about it, come on!! Mr Smith (Pitt) has more arms and ammunition is his shed than some military units - and Mrs Smith (Jolie) has a complete set of arms and weapons in the stove - talk about being a killer in the kitchen!!! If you can get past that, well, the rest is up to you.",8,1,3,2 August 2005
Joker," What did I just watch??
","I don't get all the 10 scores for this movie. I found it to be a confusing, convoluted mess, not worth the money I paid to see it, oh wait I did not pay to see it so that is a plus. Slow, boring and full of plot holes that you could drive a truck through. If you go into this movie thinking it is an extension of the Christopher Nolan trilogy, you are in for a rude awakening. If you think that this is the Joker of the 1960s Batman, you are in for shock. Hard pass.",2,2,7,16 March 2020
Fantastic Four," Better than the reviews
","OK, first things first. I am not a movie critic and don't play one on television. I really don't like them and, on more than one occasion, have strongly disagreed with what they have to say. I regularly read the reviews of all the movies (Thank you Entertainment Weekly), that peak my interest. However, I have NEVER gone to see a movie strictly on the opinion of a MOVIE CRITIC; friend, relative, coworker maybe, movie critic, never. OK, rant over - on to the movie. The most important thing that you the reader of this message (thank you in advance for reading this, by the way) must understand is that I am not a big Fantastic Four fan. Sure I know of them, mostly through the appearances that they made in Spiderman comics (which was one of my favorites - loved both movies also) but I never really got 'into' them as much as some people. I do not own, nor never have owned, a Mister Fantastic Sippie Cup, or Human Torch Underwear or any other merchandise available. I had my own opinion of what each character is and how he/she should act. I went into this movie (having read/seen 3 different reviews - Entertain Weekly, People Magazine (I think), and Ebert and Roper) with very low expectations. It was a better movie than I expected, a fun filled, high energy, popcorn movie. While the movie will not win any Oscars (I seriously doubt that it will even be nominated for any), it was fun to watch. Somewhere along the way, we the movie going public have forgotten something - movies are supposed to fun and entertaining. This is that movie!! Don't let the movie critics take over the world by saying that a movie is 'too silly' 'too unbelievable' 'poorly scripted' or whatever they use for the catchphrase of the week. Go see a movie to have fun and be entertained.",7,0,0,16 July 2005
The Great Escape," Quite Possibly the best World War II Movie Ever!!!
","Based on actual events (the History Channel just ran a special on it, interviewing people who were there) the movie is gripping, exciting and thoroughly breathtaking.  Although some artistic license was taken, this is how life (and death) was for the thousands of Allied POWs captured during the war.  If you want to see a 'lighthearted' view of being a POW during World War II was, go watch 'Hogan's Heroes' reruns - if you want to see how World War II really was, then this is the movie for you.",10,2,4,22 February 2002
