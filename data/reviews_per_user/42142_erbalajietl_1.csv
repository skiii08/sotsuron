Skyfall," The worst ever bond movie..
","Movie starts with an action block,where 007 tries to retrieve a disk.While fighting,shot by the baddies and falls into the waterfall.Not only this,a lift stunt,exploding a house in the climax are the few things seems to be good.Other than that,its a very ordinary,sorry not even ordinary to mention the plot...I don't know what they had in their mind,while going for shoot. Its completely ridiculous,to bring down such a brand name...Bond..James bond..Its a plot of Disappointment to the viewers,not much action or story can be expected....",2,28,55,2 November 2012
