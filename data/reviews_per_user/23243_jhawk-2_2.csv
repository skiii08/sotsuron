Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Movie lives up to Star Wars reputation
","The Phantom Menace delivers. This movie is good, maybe not quite as good as the originals, but I would say its 90% of the way there, which makes it much better than most of the crap Hollywood puts out. Episode 1 moves along at a fast and entertaining pace and is never boring. The special effects are great but they are not the best reason to see the movie. It's the story and action that is really good. The critics are way off base calling this a 'major disappointment'.I will definitely go see it again.",8,0,0,24 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Silly philosophical narration detracts from otherwise powerful war movie
","This movie had some excellent battle scenes that take place about an hour and a half into the movie. These scenes, plus the overall mood of sadness makes this a powerful movie that I would recommend. However, the doctoral philosophical narration by average soldiers doesn't ring true and gets to be downright silly and annoying as the movie goes on. I think this was a bit of self-indulgence by the director.Despite that, I was never at any time bored with this picture. It definitely holds your attention.",6,0,0,22 January 1999
