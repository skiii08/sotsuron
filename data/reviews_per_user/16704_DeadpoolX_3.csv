The Ring," Cheap scare tactics
","Having been told by everyone I know that The Ring is the SCARIEST MOVIE EVER and MADE ME LOSE SLEEP FOR WEEKS, my expectations were fairly high.  I honestly don't understand why this film has everyone pulling the covers over their heads.  It's average, nothing more, and it's cheap.  Most of its supposed horror is of the 'jarring musical chord as a door is opened to reveal a mutilated corpse' variety.  It wasn't effective in Friday the 13th Pt. VII, and it's not particularly effective here.  Once in a while something will disturb you or make you jump - the girl lurching out of the television, or the disgusting makeup job on the victims of the killer videotape - but on the whole The Ring is inconsistent and annoying.  The two main characters were so irritating, inept and aggressively stupid I not only didn't care what happened to them, I wanted them to die BEFORE their seven-day countdown reached zero.  There's simply no reason we should care what happens to them.  The son is nothing but another incarnation of the 'preternaturally intelligent or intuitive child' archetype we see in too many movies these days.  His connection with Samara is never explained. The ending is smug and self-satisfied and makes no sense; I could almost see Gore Verbinski (who also directed Mouse Hunt) standing up in his chair, yelling '1 4M CL3V4R!!!1'If you want to watch a movie that's as creepy and atmospheric as The Ring tried to be, watch the vastly underrated The Mothman Prophecies.6/10",6,0,1,17 April 2003
Blade," Lifeless
","The problem with Blade is that its star and director take the film far too seriously for its own good.  What should have been a fun action movie ends up unpleasant, meanspirited, humorless and unexciting.  Norrington's most recent effort, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, suffers the same lack of spirit.  Blade II is a better film from a better director (the talented Guillermo del Toro, who knows when to play a movie straight and when to make it simply a fun ride).4/10",4,1,2,13 July 2003
Signs," Almost excellent
","For all the newspaper critics' bluster about M. Night Shyamalan filling Hitchcock's shoes, this director has made quite an interesting niche all his own.  His movies are unconventional, with humor, suspense, well-crafted dialogue and minimal violence.  Signs may well be his best work to date - I'll admit it had me jumping at shadows for quite a while after watching it - but the ending is simply unforgivable, particularly in an otherwise excellent thriller.SPOILERS AHEAD.Signs is a unique film - all its flaws come into play during the last five minutes.  Shyamalan makes the inevitable mistake of showing the alien clearly.  He should have left it at the blurred newsreel footage, which was effectively disturbing.  I was willing to forgive and forget - until Graham is seen donning his priest's collar.  If we're to accept the film's assertion that everything somehow adheres to a plan set in motion by some higher power - let's call it God - does Shyamalan seriously expect us to believe that Graham would return to the priesthood when God saves his son from the terminal asthma inflicted upon him by God in the first place? God doesn't have the best track record in this movie.  He apparently cut Graham's wife in half with a truck, traumatized a mild-mannered veterinarian for life, made Graham's daughter neurotic about her drinking water and, oh, ARRANGED AN ALIEN INVASION OF EARTH AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HALF ITS POPULATION - all to bring a single jaded priest back to the fold.  If anything, shouldn't Graham be more adamant than ever in his hatred of this particular deity? Please.8/10",8,0,1,17 April 2003
