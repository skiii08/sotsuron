Lucky Number Slevin," No spoilers needed, this is the most predictable movie in recent years
","First off, let me announce that even fans of this film agree that it contains the worst interior decoration/wallpaper in the history of the cinema.Now, after the first 15 minutes of the film (entirely pointless because Bruce Willis tells a man a story for 15 minutes and then kills him (WTF?!!!)), it becomes evident as to the tone and direction of the film. But after half of it goes by it becomes morbid and overly violent; a polar of it's first half. That's a no-no.The acting makes this to be a kitschy dark comedy but it eventually transpires into a bloody mess that was evident from the start (literally, I knew where it was going to end 20 minutes into it). No sympathy for any of the characters is acquired because they do not ask for any. Also, the lack of a linear storytelling style destroys all hope of a 'proper' catharsis. Or even a remotely satisfying ending.I hated almost every minute of this film and if you want to see a 'real' revenge film watch South Korea's 'Oldboy' or even QT's 'Kill Bill Vol. 2'.D.",1,12,30,7 January 2007
Oldboy," Oldboy is a contemporary masterpiece
","Similar to the ideal behind 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2', 'Oldboy' is not your typical revenge drama. As a matter of fact, until one views the film in its entirety one will not know of the fact that the revenge does not belong to the protagonist but rather to the antagonist.A statement mentioned in the review before mine claims that 'Oldboy' does not have a 'meaning', that its ending is not satisfactory (when comparing to 'Seven', 'Memento', and 'The Sixth Sense'). Those two films are not 'revenge flicks', they are trend setters that work entirely on atmosphere and that their endings do not necessarily need to be important.'Memento''s ending is flawed because you don't know whether Lenny is a faker, himself, or not and whether what Joe Pantoliano says is true. 'Seven' had a message brought forth by a lunatic monster and after his surrender, the ending was not 'important', but rather a balancing act between insanity and brilliance. 'The Sixth Sense''s ending hits you like a punch and cheats the audience because who Bruce Willis' character REALLY is is inconsequential to the story of the boy who speaks to ghosts.Also aforementioned is a quote by Morgan Freeman; but to honest, 'The world is a beautiful place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part.' is a quote from Ernest Hemmingway.Oldboy is visceral and brutal but is also bold and insightful as to the fact that although you have had harm done unto you do not try and seek revenge by murder or vigilance. Try your best to understand WHY the terrible occurrence had happened to you and what you can NOW do to fix it.That is the ideal, the 'point' of 'Oldboy' and it has been exercised wonderfully.It is one of 2005's best films (in North America), although it is copyright 2004.D.",10,12,85,20 August 2005
The Prestige," The Prestige doesn't work due to acute predictability
","Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is a very good looking movie and is very well acted. That having been said Chris Nolan plants so many winks toward the audience and little hints everywhere so that the 'not so average' movie goer could see where it is leading one hour into the film. I did and so I am greatly disappointed.If 'The Prestige' carries such an elaborate plot, with many twists and turns and a touch of sci-fi to it (no spoiler warning needed, it is mentioned in the commercial) then why make it simple for audiences to follow it? Movies like this carry great weight with terrific work and craftsmanship but for the second hour I sat in the theater knowing the end.This is not really a review, seeing that I don't need to review this film after hundreds have already done, but it is simply that if you follow the film properly (by listening to what the characters say without taking everything literally and by seeing everything that you are indeed seeing) its payoff will be quite sub-par.I compare this to 'The Illusionist' because both films attempt to pull off a con on the audience. 'The Illusionist' carries more grace, in its almost 1920's film-making style, and the plot is harder to figure out but overall it carries realism, which 'The Prestige' does not (by a long shot).5/10 due to a terribly predictable story that is purposely woven in that fashion by Chris Nolan. If you want to see film that is airtight and what ill awe you, watch his film 'Following'.D.",3,39,96,28 October 2006
