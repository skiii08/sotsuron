E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Please don't get the Special edition.
","My review is for the theatrical release. The special edition gets -800,000,000,000,000 in my scorebook. From the way ET gallops away from the UFO investigators at the beginning instead of gliding, from the cartoony-fake CGI facial expressions, to the infamous walky talkies scene, its inferior in a million ways. If I'm not mistaken if you want HD you're stuck with that crap edition. If you're showing it to your kids please just use the theatrical release which can be found on DVD. Not as good picture quality obviously but then you don't have to see a favorite of your childhood get maimed before your eyes. As for the new 'special' effect, they look cartoony and faker than the old stuff which is funny because they're supposed to be in there because Spielberg thought the old stuff looked fake. Avatar these 'special' effects ain't.",10,1,2,9 May 2010
Citizen Kane," Overrated..
","Completely. Who thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about a newspaper editor? How boring of an idea is that? If this weren't a 'Great Movie' I would have already forgotten about it by now. Some of the techniques used to make the film may have been revolutionary but that is irrelevant in terms of how good the film actually is. That is significant but should go down in some cinematography textbook, just because someone discovered some revolutionary method of film-making doesn't mean it makes his/her story interesting, quite the contrary. If you want to see a classic see Mrs. Miniver, The Best Years of Our Lives, or His Girl Friday. Anything but this snoozer.",2,7,18,12 December 2006
