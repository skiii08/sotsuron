The Blair Witch Project," The memory remains...
","...and finally, we get to see the blair witch in Italy! Thanks to the unrelenting hype the movie is doing GREAT at the box office, but almost everyone hates it. Why? They were expecting a conventional horror movie with its quick fix of gore and shivers. BWP is a different thing:at first it left me completely cold. I liked the idea behind the project,but found it over-hyped. Then, a few hours later the full force of the film hit me like a bullet train. I was at a gig when I finally understood the final moments of the film:man, i felt goosebumps all over my body! And then, and then:other scenes,other moments jostle in my mind for attention since the day I saw this movie... watching the BWP is a very disturbing experience. Go see it not expecting your run-of-the-mill movie,but something different, something special... Rating:8",10,1,2,24 February 2000
The Beach," The first half's great. The rest isn't
","I read the novel a year or so ago. The story seemed intriguing enough, but, while an entertaining read, it was nothing special, sorry. I saw the movie today. The story seemed intriguing enough,but, while an entertaining flick, it was nothing special, sorry. Just exactly what is wrong and what isn't with this film? The first hour is almost great,right from the very first shot. It's all very stylish, colourful,with an excellent cinematography.The  Carlyle cameo is very good, the female lead is pretty wonderful, Tilda Swinton plays Sal in exactly the way I expected the character to be, and DiCaprio is not everywhere. There are flaws here and there, of course:the screenplay doesn't follows the original story too much,Leo almost gets the girl-or should I say girls?-but all in all everything's shaping up quite nicely. Then everything goes wrong,and the last 30-40 minutes are almost embarrassing, from a gung-ho Leo to the confrontation with the drug dealers-completely different to what happens in the movie-to the final escape. Here,the movie loses its balance, It's Leo,Leo,Leo everywhere, and it all goes downhill. Too bad. Still, there are some beautiful moments, the cast is pretty nice, the soundtrack is fabulous,but it could have been much much better. Rating:6 Oh, and DiCaprio is not THAT great an actor, ok?",7,0,0,2 March 2000
American Beauty," Almost Perfect
",2 things that will haunt me for a while about this movie:a whirling plastic bag and the look in a girl's eyes as seen from a digital camera. This movie is high class.That it comes from a major is quite astonishing. Almost perfect.Great acting.Great script.Great direction. Rating:9,9,0,0,2 February 2000
Toy Story 2," A nice, entertaining cartoon who does wonders with technology
","Pixar's on the rise. I must admit, there was a time once where I was skeptical about digital animation feature films: being a cartoon nut, i thought that digital animation was a threat to good old toons, representing the triumph of form over substance. Boy, did they prove me wrong... Over these past years we've seen some astounding examples of digital animation movies,balancing the right mixture of technology with a good story and cast, and TS2 is no exception. The film has everything. It's a sight to see(never has DA reached such great heights)a great cast,with some fine additions, Joan Cusack and the Newman guy,for example,and a nice story. It's entertaining for the kids and for the young at heart. Good work! Rating:7",7,0,1,21 March 2000
The Green Mile," Sometimes the mile is so long..
","That's the last line you hear in the movie, and, well, it sums up the entire film pretty nicely. TGM never ends. It's definitely too long,and a better editing would have made the movie a favour. As it is , it's an accurate adaption of a King novel that wasn't much cop in the first time. I understand sticking to the original source,but was it all so necessary?? The supporting cast is very good,especially Percy and Brutal,and there are 2 or 3 moments that remain with you - the 1st electrocution scene, for example. But all in all, TGM is too little coming from the director of a marvellous movie such as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Rating:5",5,1,2,21 March 2000
