The Avengers," Most overrated movie
",This is the most overrated movie of this year. There is nothing special in the movie except few humour. The story is pretty old and and we can bow for the special effect.But the special effect has been wasted for such a movie with no story. Movie such as Darknight has rating of 8.9 which is worth but this movie is not worth for such ratings.Its a childish story. Please give good ratings for good movies. Movie is worth watching once but surely this is not special movie for such hyper rating.Hollywood movies of recent days does not have good story but gives more importance to special effect.,1,47,149,29 April 2012
