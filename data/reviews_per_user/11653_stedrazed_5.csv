The Blair Witch Project," Say what you will, it's very innovative and honestly frightening.
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is all about effect. It's the kind of movie best enjoyed on the first viewing, like THE RING or MEMENTO; analyze it to heavily and you ruin some of the thrills. The concept of a completely staged documentary is, of course, not new. The best example, and the one that BLAIR WITCH most resembles, is an excellent French film called MAN BITES DOG; the latter is a much better film, but BLAIR WITCH pulls off its premise more realistically than any other 'mockumentary' I've ever seen. Talented but completely unknown actors man the cameras and much of the sound effects throughout the film, while simultaneously remaining in character enough to improvise as each new terror is presented to them. Of course, they knew it was all staged, but the verisimilitude achieved in the film cannot be denied. Shooting in 'real time' and actually depriving the actors of food and rest, as well as scripted lines and any cognizance of plot direction, it is easy to see how writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez managed to perpetrate this ingenious hoax to the point where audiences were actually terrified. This is a very realistic, ominous and visceral film.",8,0,1,25 April 2003
Elf," Not for the overly cynical.
","Jon Favreau's ELF is one of those movies that the cynic in us wants to hate, but the child in us has the good sense to love. When it was over I wanted to clap, despite the fact that no one involved in the film would hear the applause, and I literally couldn't stop smiling throughout the entirety of the end credits. Yes, of course it's corny; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves. And, yes, it is rather predictable in that every character and plot nuance comes to its logical conclusion. Far-fetched? Obviously; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves! But ELF never pretends to be anything more or less than what it is: that most dreaded of cliches, a 'feel-good' movie. Now, usually I am the first one to scorn corny, oversentimental art of any kind, and I have been known to (as Stephen King once phrased it) 'blow my nose' on happy endings. Well, I went into ELF with a healthy dose of my usual cynicism, knowing only that anything involving Jon Favreau was, at least, sure to make me laugh once or twice. What can I say? ELF is funny, touching, and basically just fun in every possible way. Will Ferrel as Buddy: the perfect way for this great comic actor to become a star. In his first leading role, he carries this film like a plate of Christmas cookies. The ease with which he assumes the role makes you wonder if he really was raised by elves. James Caan is quite good as Buddy's human father, Ed Asner is the best Santa Claus ever put on film, and Bob Newhart is ... well, Bob Newhart, but the icing on the gingerbread cookie is Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the cute-as-an-elf human with whom Buddy falls in love. There is a youthful, exuberant beauty about her that makes you forget how painful love can actually be, and this beauty extends to her excellent voice, a key factor in the film's third act. Her acting, of course, is not put to the most rigorous of tests in this film, but is certainly strong enough for the role she plays. ELF is one of the best Christmas movie to come out since TRAPPED IN PARADISE. Avoid THE HAUNTED MANSION, THE CAT IN THE HAT, and probably any of the other big 'Kid's movies' this season (except maybe the new HARRY POTTER), and see this with your family instead. Or see it alone; I did, and enjoyed every minute.",8,0,1,28 November 2003
Lost in Translation," A quietly beautiful film.
","What would you do if you met your soulmate after 25 years of marriage to someone else? What could you do? After a quarter of a century of commitment, including children, to one person, how do you even admit to yourself that you've just found your ideal companion, especially when that person is married as well? This is the dilemma with which Bob Harris (Bill Murray) finds himself faced in Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION. Oh, did I also mention he's stuck in a country whose language and culture he doesn't begin to understand? Murray's performance is excellent, his best work in years. The lines of age in his face and his subtle, toned-down gestures and expressions erase the Bill Murray we all thought we knew, leaving only Bob Harris. This is not to say that the role is humorless ---- far from it. But it is a deadpan, morose kind of humor, the humor of a man who makes another person smile to keep from crying himself. When Bob and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansen) meet and begin getting to know each other, they speak often of Bob's 'mid-life crisis', but this is in no way the story of a middle-aged man's desperate, self-destructive infatuation with a much younger woman. This is the tender, unspoken romance of two beautiful misfits kept apart by self-defeating fidelities and the prejudices of time. What would have happened had Bob and Charlotte been the same age and unmarried when they met? Certainly something wonderful to experience but, in terms of the film, much less poignant and interesting to watch. It is the looks of longing between Bob and Charlotte, the aforementioned subtle gestures of Bob, that make this film such a sad and beautiful experience. It is the performances that immediately capture the viewer of this film, but never doubt that Sofia Coppola is a fine and wonderful filmmaker. She doesn't rely on any flashy camerawork or clever plot devices to tell her story, but don't be fooled by the film's minimalism; Coppola has written a profoundly beautiful script. The dialogue is sparse at times, but this only lends greater power to the words that are spoken. Murray has a line in this film that I may never forget: 'The more you know who you are and what you want, the less you let things upset you.' Simply put, but just ringing with universal truth and importance. LOST IN TRANSLATION is funny, sad, warm, irritating, fulfilling, thought-provoking, simple, tedious, surprising and beautiful, just like real life. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever felt alive or, more importantly, wanted to.",10,0,0,18 November 2003
The Last Samurai," Meh.
","I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this film, at a midnight screening of THE MATRIX RELOADED (which, I must admit was far more disappointing). I happily took in the beautiful Japanese landscapes and Samurai action in the beginning of the trailer, then became disappointed, and even mildly outraged, at the appearance of Tom Cruise onscreen. Seeing the film tonight was much the same experience. I found myself really enjoying the first act of the film, then my enthusiasm kind of dropped off steadily from there on in. I guess it was because I already knew from the trailer where this portion of the film was leading, so predictability was no complaint. The sequence in which Cruise remorsefully ponders his so-called heroism is honestly moving. Also, I really liked Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader. But the dialogue and denouement are too typically cliched and predictable, much like John Logan's most well-known screenplay, GLADIATOR, and the score is awful. The main problem with the film, though, is its triteness, trading heavy orchestral chords by Hans Zimmer for real emotional moments of magnitude, and nicely choreographed battle scenes for an original story. I mean, come on, this is basically just DANCES WITH WOLVES in Japan, complete with voice-over diary entries. Oh, and also not as good. Sure does look pretty though.",6,1,2,15 December 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Quite possibly the greatest film of all time.
","Words cannot describe the genius that is Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; it must be seen. In fact, it must be seen over and over again, and compared to Anthony Burgess's equally brilliant novel, and then seen a few more times for good measure. Malcolm McDowell is utterly impeccable as Alexander DeLarge (get it?), a name in keeping with the sly pun names of Kubrick's DOCTOR STRANGELOVE. For those of you who haven't seen it (shame on you), I will briefly explain the title, and no more; YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!!!!!! A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, in the novel, is actually the title of a book being written by an old man whom Alex and his 'droogies' ('that is Pete, Georgie and Dim') attack, beat and rob one night. The idea is that when a man loses his free will to the justice system, through punishment and so-called 'rehabilitation', he becomes as a clockwork orange: flesh and the semblance of life on the outside, but all mechanical gears on the inside. That should give you some indication of what happens to Alex, but not too much. Remember, you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; the greatest who ever lived, in my opinion. The complexity of the symbolism, the beauty of the decor, the intricate three-act structure, the uniquely dark humor and comedically melodramatic pathos ---- there's simply no other film like it. Nor will there ever be. I consider 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to be the greatest achievement ever made in the cinema, but for sheer viewing pleasure, this is my favorite film. See it at all costs; then see it again.",10,0,0,6 May 2003
