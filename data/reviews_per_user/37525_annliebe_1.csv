Moneyball," Good Movie
","'MoneyBall' is drama/comedy directed by Bennett Miller. True story based on Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The director has done a good job combining a smart script with humor. Brad Pitt was a perfect pick for the roleÂ… his dry humor adds a lot to the movie. I'm not a baseball fan and you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy this film.Bennett Miller kept his docudrama style adding comedy to keep it fun and interesting for all the different types of audiences. he's a great director, has shot numerous documentaries. He's best known for his biographical film 'Capote' about Truman Capote released in 2005.I wasn't very excited about this movie after watching the trailers; it seemed to be like any other sports drama where everybody wins and has a happy ending, but ended up been better than what I expected. I gave this film its fair chance to impress me and it definitely did. I recommend it.",9,3,10,19 September 2011
