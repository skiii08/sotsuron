It," Bog standard... Not scary
","I'll start out by saying, the worst thing about this film is Pennywise The Clown. And seeing as he's an integral part of the film it doesn't for me bode well.As soon as he appears and talks I couldn't help but think he sounded like Scooby Doo... Anybody else notice that?I didn't like the casting of him - he looked baby-faced and childish. The kids were great. The town looks superb. But the film was very very average. Standard CGI to create nightmarish images that in this day and age you can pretty much see on a TV show, give or take.To be fair though, I was never a fan of the original, I'm not a fan of this and care less there's a sequel.'Clown' by Jon Watts is an infinitely better and creepier film and made at a fraction of the price.Over-hyped, overcooked, run of the mill 'horror'.",4,1,2,28 October 2017
Rise of the Guardians," Great film **NO SPOILERS KIDS**
","The main thing you need for a good animated film is story. Quite often that's missing. Rise Of The Guardians succeeds massively here.Brilliant story idea really well executed.The other essentials parts were spot on too: cute characters were cute, funny bits were funny, the baddie was very creepy and the dark scary scenes added great contrast.Will definitely watch again.A satisfying 9 out of 10 for me",9,0,0,20 November 2017
Mudbound," Heavy, but food for thought **NO SPOILERS**
","This is in no way an easy watch. It's a stark reminder of just how tough life can be. But how tough it must've been for blacks at this time in this part of America is impossible for me to comprehend.What I can understand is a good film and good acting. This is indeed a very good film about hardship and it's one that is finely acted.Definitely worth a watch, but the subject matter will leave an imprint on you. Not easy, not pretty, but life isn't always those things either.8 out of 10 for me",8,3,8,26 November 2017
Life," LOVED IT!!! **Absolutely No spoilers**
","So many reviews criticizing the lack of logical actions by the characters I think are being way too critical. IMO, watch the film, cut it some slack and enjoy for what it aims to do. I'm sure it doesn't claim in any way to be scientifically plausible. But then neither is acid for blood....For me, this has restored my faith in sci-fi / horror films - this week I watched Alien Covenant and thoroughly hated it.'Life' on the other hand I found to be top notch.Jake Gyllenhaal, great again in that slightly dislocated way he's perfected. Quality performance. Also, Rebecca Ferguson, stand-out performance too. Very strong acting and convincing in every scene.The film for me never went too far for the thrills. The ending worked for me personally. A brilliant 'film night' film in my humble opinion. Make your choice as to whether to try it out and just go with it. Or not.I really enjoyed it",7,0,1,9 November 2017
Alien: Covenant," Disgusted
","NO SPOILERS HERE.I wondered why the score for this was pretty low. Now I think anything above my score is generous.... Giving this 3 out of 10:one mark for how the film looks, a mark for Fassbender, a mark for Katherine Waterston.That's it for me with Ridley Scott. He's shot credibility of judgement out of the water. If it is possible to call a film disgraceful, this is it.Carbon copy of original Alien with an ending that just staggers belief. The most unsatisfying and weakest ending I can recall.I can say with sincerity, I hated this film",3,2,3,1 November 2017
Draft Day," Great film - very exciting **NO SPOILERS**
","I've now watched this film three times and have enjoyed it just as much as the first.I must admit I'm a sucker for American sports films even though I'm English. I'm also a Kev Costner fan - in spite of a fairly large consensus of people who find him cheesy. His performance in this is pretty spot on.The film is fast paced and exciting in the kind of way that The Social Network is. It's non-stop movement and there isn't really any time given to reflection or contemplation. The clock is ticking on Draft Day and that's represented well in how the film's made.Admittedly, it's not quite up there with Moneyball - but it's highly exciting none the less. Kev's great, Jennifer Garner is really really good, this is very watchable even if you aren't into sport.A racey 8 out of 10 for me",8,0,1,5 December 2017
