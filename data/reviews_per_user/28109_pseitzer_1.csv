Requiem for a Dream," an intoxicating plunge into the minds and lives of four addicts
","This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. A combination of a penetrating story, powerful visual imagery, and superb acting contribute to the overwhelming power of this film. Before seeing this movie, I asked a few friends of mine what they thought of it. One friend told me that he was unable to eat for a day after seeing the movie, another said the movie made him seriously depressed. I did not believe that a movie could have such power, but after seeing it, I feel similarly shaken. I would not recommend this movie to the faint of heart, or as a means of 'entertainment'. The movie deals with four addictive personalities and explores the mind of the addict, focusing on their feelings of frustration, terror, and strong conflicting emotions about their addictions. the four main characters start their lives from relative peace and security and plunge into an unfathomable well of loss and unimaginable horror. This movie will grab hold of you and never let go.",10,1,2,9 May 2006
