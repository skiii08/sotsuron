Hereditary," Totally overrated
","Every cliche American horror film must have a husband who never believes his wife. So does Hereditary. Why is it so difficult for Steve just to throw the book in the stove!? The beggining of the film is extremely slow that people fell asleep during the screening. Throughout the whole film, nobody has even been surprised by any shot or plot. The mom overacted too much. The 'screaming acting' style. The build up of the little girl didn't lead to anything deeper rather than a few drawing on the stretch book and the sound. I went to watch because of the 7.6 rating but extremely disappointed. It lacks strength, development, deeper love (now floating on the surface), structure. I wish they played conjuring and I would enjoy watching it for a third time.",1,38,82,7 August 2018
