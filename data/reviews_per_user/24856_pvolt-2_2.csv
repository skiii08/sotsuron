Requiem for a Dream," sickening
","There are clearly some people here who didn't get this film at all.  I'm not sure if they are the people who were distracted by their mates during the movie, or just people who have no idea what addiction is about.I've had quite a bit of experience with various drugs over the past ten years, and this film gave me a pretty nasty flashback.  I'm with Heavenly Creature above, and I will not be watching this again, it's just too disturbing.Despite this, this movie is NOT about drugs, it's about addiction.  'What's my mom's fix?  Television!'  says Harry Goldfarb.  Burstyn's character is also addicted to her chocolate and other sweet food, the craving patterns that non-drug users are the same as those of the junkie.  This wasn't just another drug film, it was a lesson in addiction, but it seems it just went over some people's heads.",10,0,0,5 September 2001
Save the Last Dance," Nondescript, but lacked major flaws.
","Although as a 30 year old male I am clearly not the target audience for this chick flick, it did have a couple of redeeming qualities.  While the plot held very little of interest, it was great to see a film which looked like it had been planned in advance rather than shot spontaneously.  The dialogue may have been mostly cliched and the acting robotic, but pronunciation was good.  Some critics have already pointed out that the dancing was lack-lustre, but at least noone fell over.Overall, the film makers did manage to get the basics of this film down, and I think there may be some potential for crew who were not directly involved with the weak directing, lousy acting, poor script-writing and disappointing choreography.  Lighting and costuming, for example, were totally adequate.",5,0,1,18 June 2001
