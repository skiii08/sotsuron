The New World," Boring
","The movie is much too boring, and the 'DEJAVU' feeling comes to my head too often while watching. Films like 'The last of the Mohicans' and the narrative remembering 'Apocalipse Now' seemed to be a starting point for the director. The story is too weak and pointless, i'm sick too see movies that have a lot of potential turn into romances. I fell asleep while watching this movie, and in my opinion Farrel does not have the right feeling to transpose to is lead character. The film goes around and around in circles without any mean less or purpose, the Hollywood industry as came to a point that what matters is earning money to the opposite of making good movies....
