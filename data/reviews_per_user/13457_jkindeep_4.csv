Marie Antoinette," Much ado about nothing.. The soft porn of french history
","I happened to be in Paris, and I was in Versilles on the same day I saw the movie. It was full of French poured into my mind. Also a friend I was in the cinema together was a french intellectual who very much in love with his own cultural majestic standards. So I went to see the movie with full of enthusiasm.I never seen any of Sofia's film before, I haven't seen the 'Lost in translation' as I was little skeptical about her portrayal of Japanese culture from European oriented view. no objection, also I assume that she is very much into the crash between two culture, so the theme is a continuum from her previous movies.It has the same elements, Marie is came from Austria to France, her provocative characters are crashed into the very cold and cynical French tradition, the isolated being as shown in the 'Lost in translation'. She was hatred and chewed by public in a very wrongful matter. So here comes justice from Sofia, she set Marie as an eccentric, artistic frontier who as an obviously misunderstood individual.The movie follow the style of Baz Luhmna's Romio and Juliette, modern adaptation of old history, there were modern soundtrack rather than classics, also the dialogs are quite modern,humorous, cheeky and fierce.It is soft porn, nothing really a new in the movie, colors are vibrant, music is funky, camera rolls fast but what's new in the movie is what's lack in the movie. More like a teenage movie version of French history. Remember, how 'Queen Margot' was a magnificent movie with full of emotional and inter-wined turmoil of the history and individual? The film might be 'enjoyable' as pop song, but you won't be listening again in years later. Its not a must see movie, but if you are light-hearted, and sick of watching serious history channel, then go for it. Also a bonus, they not speak French, they speak English. If That's what you after, go for the French porn with a touch of American soda pop.",4,1,4,29 October 2006
Big Fish," A real 'Big-fish' can
","If the movie is an art form that deliver the personal interpretation of the world what the artist see and feel. Tim Burton's world is exaggerated in darkness and sadness of a boy who is rejected from the world, so he creates his own world in darkest colors from a crayon box he has. Thus the movie is full of those wonderful dark colors such as charcoal black, dark blue and purplish Grey. All the characters are rejected from the society or rather intentionally ejected themselves and lives in an alienated world of their own, full of mysterious characters with those tortured dreams.This movie isn't too far away from his previous creations but it shift little. The movie is full of colors, warmer and brighter. The camera moves faster. I assume that that's how the director's view is heading, almost dreaming and also forgiving.The movie is totally a 'make-believe' itself, by the end of movie, you are starting to wish, to see if the 'big-fish' is real, still swimming around in the pool. Even if you know you are deceiving, you left in charm. If the cinema is fake as same as the 'big-fish', this is real cinema that makes the cinema 'real'. Make the movie as a genuine 'Big-Fish', so you feel like criticizing nothing at all when finally the ending credits rolls.Helena-Bornham Carter's almost perfect New Jersey accent, also, Ewan Mcgregor's not-so-perfect New Jersey accent is also another 2 'Big-Fish' in the movie, we are all here to believe (so we forgive).Albert Finney was always great, as I see him as an American answer to Britain's Sir Anthony Hopkins.How wonderful to see a movie is so different from others that are full of 'Freud-sque' oppression of sexual desires,tortured dreams and weighed pressure (name the Kubrick). A one's life could be dark and also full of sinful mistakes from a viewpoint of psycho analysis's. This movie will open your hardest heart and will leave you to dream, once more. The Tim Burton's best movie yet, where the real people with a 'big-fish' in a same can.",10,3,4,4 November 2006
The Descent," intensified original horror movie in ages, worth seeing
","I had no expectation before watch this movie, but impressive enough to kept me guessing the end. Horror genres got so 'not-so-scary', since horror genre became b-grade Tarantino' style - just epitome of visual virtuosity but no suspenses. However, this movie makes you creep and lives on your mind as the subtext in the movie is so cleverly wrapped in a box. Like opening Pandora's box, the movie is keep surprising to the end. The script was original as 'cube'. If you are a horror movie fan, you wouldn't be disappointed. Assume that human fear most is physical vulnerability than psychological as mind can be stronger in situation but there is certain limitation in physics.The sublime in the plot is cleverly done as you might guess in the end that she is in living hell, also the message in the movie 'love each day' is a clever paradoxical use of metaphor in the movie. So watched twice and still made me shiver at the second repeat. So enjoy the cleavage of the movie, and 'love your each day' in life. Hell or heaven, you choose.",8,0,1,20 April 2007
300," Worst movie ever made in grand scale
","This is absolute waste of talent(Only in Visual Effect) and budget. No plot, no storyline, pure violence and selling this under the name of 'Justice'? How 'clever' it can get? The actors didn't needed much of their acting skills than wearing the 6 pack charged 'probably' rubber uniform. The subtext is clearly political and racial. How this movie was possibly made and gone into no.1 in the box office? Patriotism gone so dumb that could forgive this political suicide? Is that makes one race superior if they got 6-packed muscle, sword and leather underwear? What was the justice they were fighting for when their people never agreed in war, isn't that what dictator only could do? Also what a portrait to describe queen as somehow mindless whore, and what was the necessary of sex scene with politician? Is there a necessity? I have wondered if this movie is some kind of gay porn with head-chopping very unfunny humor embedded. Also what on earth David Wenman's accent came from? Did he tried to speak Greek in English? This is shocking from Warner Bros, provoking and selling the message of war, justifying violence, is so unflattering. Justice has been served, in the end. As all the 299 got butchered by their own sword, called 'stupidity'. I am hoping that there is no 301 or 299.",1,9,18,20 April 2007
