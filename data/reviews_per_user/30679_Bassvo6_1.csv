Sucker Punch," Wow
",I went into this movie hearing all the negative critic reviews. DO NOT buy into what critics and haters are saying. This movie literately has everything I want in it. I rarely listened to critics before but I have completely lost any faith I had in them. If I would have listened to them I would have ended up seeing Johnny Depp is Rango which can not be good but still has a higher rating. Sucker Punch is a solid movie all around. The only knock I'll give it is Mr. Synder needs to calm down with the slow motion. If your looking to spend $10 dollars and be entertained you will not be disappointed. Trust me this movie is cult classic in the making. Just look at the fan ratings.,10,5,13,28 March 2011
