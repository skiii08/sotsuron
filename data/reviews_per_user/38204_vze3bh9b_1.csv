","I'm not one to get scared at movies, but this movie was amazing.  I didn't get scared at this movie, but ohh god the chills.  I must have got chills 15 times the first time I saw the movie, I went back, and they were still there.  This is a great horror movie, simply for the chill factor.  I was impressed as hell, and creeped out at the same time.  If you haven't seen it. GO RENT IT.  If you've seen it. you probably agree.",10,1,1,7 March 2003
