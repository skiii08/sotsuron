Walk the Line," Take a bow Mr Phoenix
","I am a big Johnny Cash fan and was worried that The spineless Caesar in Gladiator could pull off the role of My music icon. Nevertheless he took on the role as he was made for it, obviously he did is homework as he adopts some of the mannerisms of Johnny Cash whilst singing. Reese Witherspoon's role of June carter is also grade A. The story is of the struggle that Johnny Cash faces over addiction to drugs and alcohol. With the death of his brother who he idolised, through a horrific accident, with the neglect of his father J.R. is set for a difficult road ahead. If you to are a Cash fan, don't worry you wont be disappointed.",9,1,2,8 January 2006
