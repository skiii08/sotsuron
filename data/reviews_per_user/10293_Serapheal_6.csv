Deja Vu," Tight Screenplay, Excellent Acting. Quality entertainment.
","If it wasn't for Denzel Washington, I would've gave this movie a 6, coz this movie, even though it deals with a semi-new concept for Movies, it explains it from a very familiar SCI-FI perspective. And, thus this movie reminded me too much of Minority Report. I like the concept of real-time viewing using satellites and software that will recreate 3d imagery in real-time, that was very cool, and maybe even possible! The only problem is it's similarity with the format of many other movies, thus making every moment predictable and thus boring. It's like we have these Successful Hollywood writers that didn't know how to invest their money for previous successes and therefore are rehashing new concepts with old formula's in order to pay their Rent. LOL LMAO Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and the concepts thereof. Did that make sense ? Oh well, I think I'm still recovering from the Columbian Gold I enjoyed prior to viewing the movie. It was awesome. Or like Paris Hilton says about everything she can't truly understand, ' It was HOT!' I'd like to see a movie with Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohann and some other Beotch. They can call it, Apocolips: and the 4 horsewomen. The go about destroying the world and in fact they're the the daughters of Satan, sent by him to corrupt the world with their Seduction Debauchery and man raping. Something like that.Okay, that should be 10 lines of finely parsed text. I'm outta here.",10,1,3,29 November 2006
Children of Men," Excellent Movie, but the ending makes you want more...
","I would've gave this a 10 however, I was hoping for a more climatic ending. Thus, the ending was a bit predictable in my opinion. Yet, I liked this it. The cinema photography is top Rate ! Excellent ! I was totally immersed in the environment and nothing looked fake. Truly amazing SCI FI ! Also, I was hoping for a bit more SCI FI elements that'd explain why women were no longer having babies. Something relevant. Hint hint ! Come on you Screenwriters, even I could think up something better. Well, actually I think I will do that !! Ha ha. Anyway, this movie is a must-see for any SCI FI enthusiast or casual movie goer. It definitely makes you ponder the question whether Genetic tampering could actually lead to such a predicament.",9,3,5,18 January 2007
The Descent," One of the stupidest movies I've ever had to witness.
","Senseless, stupid, idiotic, insignificant, balderdash, a complete waste of time. Not even worth renting on DVD. This movie is pure garbage. Who is funding this crap. Nothing of value can be obtained from watching this movie. 6 women go on a cave hunt, get lost, and end up being attacked by cave dwelling half bat humanoid blind creatures. Oh, and then there's the person that always ends up breaking their leg. Then the schizoid character and all the stereotypical characters that are poorly developed in this film. There is nothing new in this film. What a waste. Whoever funded this crap is an idiot. Okay, so I wasted my time viewing this movie... there is one redeemable factor however, and that I must forewarn others not to watch this crap. Please, don't see this movie, you'll be wasting your time. download it if you should be compelled to watch a cave movie, then fast forward through all it's stupidity, which is the entire movie. Okay I think I reached over 10 lines now. If your a cave climber then perhaps you'll want to watch this stupid movie. If not, then don't waste your time.",1,22,43,2 December 2006
The Fountain," Yo dude pass the joint this way.
","That's what I needed to get through this movie. Talk about philosophically pretentious. haha. well the graphics were new, the sound was cool, the structure was inter mangled and the storyline had too many plot holes. I mean there was nothing significant enough to stick in memory long enough to make sense out of. Most the time I sat there wondering 'What the F?' Like what's it all mean dude. Oh Wow. Now 'The Departed' was a solid Movie. But, Fountain is all a mish mash of half-baked ideas.Darron did you seriously write this or steal someones treatment and tried to make sense out of someones rough draft then called it your work. ? Hmmmm, come on, be honest with yourself ! I don't think this even falls in the realm of Arrons thought processes. Compared to his other 2 movies which had similarities, Fountain was a total departure. Now, I know we all don't live in a vacuum, so Darron you must've gotten these ideas somewhere else. Did you like,.. download a few of those amateur screenplays, found a gem, and called it your own ? Is that it. Cause I really doubt this is your work at all. Serious. and I'll say this to your face. I'd like to put you to a lie detector machine to find out. Cause, this film, though very badly structured and executed, had so much potential. But, somehow, you just couldn't figure out someone else's work. You couldn't make it different enough without butchering it all to hell. Seriously. How could such a potentially brilliant concept get screwed up unless you truly knew what you were doing ? I gave this film a 1, for being a stolen idea. that's right I said it. This doesn't seem like a Darron Aronfsky Job. It's too different, also I read on Variety online that it was once called, 'The Axis' but you changed the name to avoid infringing on another movie. But in fact that movie isn't developed yet. Hmmmmmm... this is mighty peculiar. Rapheal H.",1,10,29,23 November 2006
The Matrix," Greatest SCI - FI of All time. !
","This movie is better than Star Wars, matter of fact it's better than any other SCI FI film that's ever come before it. Most cause of the use of new technologies and how they matched the storyline so well. This is a definite Must See for any serious movie buff. Heck they even have Philosophy courses that use the movie for examples. It's that good. And, of course the Bullet-Time is awesome. Thanks to Sxean Lee-David for helping creating the Idea of using 3 dimensional rotating cameras, the Wachowski's merely had the money and talent to do it, and called it 'Bullet-time'. So there you have it. I must've watched the movie dozens of times. Presently, I heard that Sxean and the Wachowski's are conjuring up a new movie, code named, 'The Axis'. I can't wait to see this. and it's nice that the Wachowski's are still working with Sxean to see his ideas and dreams materialize. What great guys those Wachowski brothers are !",10,0,1,4 December 2006
300," Messages of RACE HATRED...
","Terrible film. It caters to the most primitive of our emotions, sex and violence. Pathetic. Zack Snyder is an Idiot, if he don't know what he's causing within the minds of our youth. Either an idiot or a racist. Yeah, the Spartans didn't last long against the Romans.There's only one visual effect that I liked, but it's not original by any means. This is the wrong message to have circulating within the minds of Americans when we are at war with Iraq. A losing War. So if you like this film then I suggest you go to Iraq and see what real war is like you pathetic losers. This war mongering encouraging film is TRASH. Pure Nazi infected Trash. This would've been a great film if it wasn't for the racist undertones. too bad. Zack Snyder is a racist. So, I gave this a 1.",6,16,34,11 March 2007
