The Benchwarmers," Very funny.
","I had the pleasure of winning free tickets to a screening of this movie. As far as normal comedies go, I didn't give it a high rating. Some of it was just plain disgusting. Mostly it was funny. The actors did well, and in my opinion they all changed from their normal type characters. It's definitely worth the time to watch it. The audience in the theater got all involved and connected to the movie. We laughed, we gasped and at least 3 times, we all clapped for the characters and applauded at the end of the movie. It was a great atmosphere! You leave the movie feeling good and proud. When we walked out, a lady asked what my favorite part was, but I couldn't pick, it was all good, I liked the whole thing! The thing I really like about this movie is that despite it being a comedy, it teaches a lesson and makes you want to be a better person. I would definitely recommend this to friends and would see it again in a heartbeat.",7,12,30,6 April 2006
