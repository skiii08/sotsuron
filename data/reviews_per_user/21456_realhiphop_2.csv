Mission: Impossible III," Awesome Sequel.. What, I'm a plant - cause i liked it??
","I find it hilarious that when a 'Cruise hater' or any other hater of any film sees a positive review - its automatically 'a plant' or fake review..well its been out for 2 days in Australia now - and i can tell you from the cinema i attended and the winding queues outside 'in the cold' for the late session - that this movie will be HUGE and do extremely well at the box office - and it deserves too..i wont rehash the story, plenty of reviews up there now for that... but if you just want my thoughts here they are..1. great action - big budget with excellent stunts 2. Unoriginal story - but made fresh with great actors & exciting locations... 3. Excellent bad guy in Phillip Seymour Hoffman - bit more screen time would have been nice though - so much more character could have been fleshed out 4. Awesome gadgets this time round 5. Much darker in tone & content than the first 2... 6. Its irrelevant as to what the 'rabbit's foot' was - it could have been a bomb, a disease, a poison - it didn't need to be told. 7. Well paced..it never got boring in 2 hours/ 8. Nice twists & unexpected turns.. i liked it, and never saw a few things coming..Excellent - easily the best of the 3 - not without faults, but still great summer entertainmentenjoy & bring on the next one..Dan",8,2,3,5 May 2006
Ocean's Twelve," NOT BAD, BUT NOT GREAT. Another sequel too rushed! Style over substance.
","Its just opened here in Australia. Here are my thoughts.1. Not a bad caper movie, and although the first was excellent, a sequel was not really necessary or asked for by audiences. 2. Julia Roberts is in the first 2 minutes of the film, then shows up for the last 10 minutes or so. She really is just thrown in there to add to box office & pick up a big paycheck for very little work. Did anyone else think she looked very skinny and unattractive in much of her scenes? She has definitely lost a lot of Hollywood clout i feel. The whole storyline of her playing *******SPOILERS**************Julia Roberts! was funny at first, but tired quickly, and the whole Bruce Willis thing seemed to drag out. 3. The storyline in general was very weak, and many of the jokes fell flat and just were not funny. I think they loved hanging out, George wanted to have parties in his waterfront mansion in italy, so it seemed like a good idea to film in europe, all cast hang out cause they are best mates, then make a fortune on a poorly thought out script & story.4.Bernie Mac was completely wasted. Why is Hollywood putting a great comedian in such a minimal role & non-funny scenes such as this (and mr 3000). listen up movie exec's BERNIE MAC IS A COMEDIAN - let him shine & do what he does best - WHICH IS MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH !5. The bad guy wasn't really 'bad' and the whole heist caper was about ego's about whose the best thief. You NEVER felt they actually felt like they were scared or were worried about Andy Garcia's threats.6. Hadn't we already seen someone Dance through the laser lights in slow motion? Oh yeah, it was CATHERINE ZETA JONES in Entrapment !7. Definitely one of Soderbergh's weakest film. Anyone agree?There were some great things about the movie though1. The Cast 2. The locations 3. The comedy that did work ( which was mostly unwritten & unsaid)..more like reactions to scenes & impressions etc.4. Catherine Zeta- jones. Damn she looks great & beautiful. She DESERVED the main female billing. Out acting & out starring Roberts.5. Some of the action 6. Matt Damon was great 7. Brad pitt looked awesome in the suits- my girlfriend was happythat's allanyone else's thoughts?Dan",6,0,0,10 December 2004
