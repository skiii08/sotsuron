50 First Dates," Good Movie
","This film is okay..It has a few good jokes and a story which is at the one side funny, at the other side unbelievable..In my opinion after a few sequences the film gets a bit 'boring' for me... the jokes get unfunny for my humor..But Adam Sandler is an actor for such movies and he makes them as funny as they are or can be.. That Drew barrymore has made such a movie, it's not understandable for me..i thought she wouldn't actor for such 'stupid' rolesp.s. sorry for may bad English, i'm German greets Chris",6,1,2,17 November 2007
