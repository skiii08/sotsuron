First Man," First Man no man
",This must be a case of the kings new clothes because I found the film First Man dull and very boring. The moon landing was probably the single most important event of the 20th century and they go and crucify it by focusing on Neil Armstrong and his personal life. which if you believe it was perthitic. He had very few social skills was a bit of a loner and had no time for his family. I suspect a lot of the portrayal of his life was down to poetic licence by the script writers Some of the actors in this film are among my favourite's and that's a pity. They should of steered clear I give the film 4 star's because of them. The quality of the filming could of been done in the 1960's it was all very depressing Apollo 13 was a hundred times better.,4,1,2,24 October 2018
Aquaman," great job
",After doing such a good job in making Aquaman I hope James Wan addresses the mess that's been made of Superman we need to bring back Superman in all his glory including a new costume the one Cavil wears is a joke.,Null,9,16,19 December 2018
