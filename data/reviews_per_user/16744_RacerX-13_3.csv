Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite The Movie
","I will admit, I am something of a Star Wars fan and that may bias my review slightly. First off, the movie is visually astonishing. The quality of the FX shots is absolutely amazing and the best I have seen so far (once again, kudos to ILM for pushing the envelope). The movie was not perfect, however, as I found the acting and dialog to be a bit too stiff. Hats off to Lucasfilm for creating a new benchmark in movies!",9,0,0,5 July 1999
The Matrix," Amazing
","The arguments for and against this film are many. Most people say it glamorizes violence, and while I certainly don't dispute that, I can say that this isn't the most violent film out there, or even the most violent one that I've seen. Personally, I loved the film. I could go on and on about what I like but I'm sure a hundred other comments have already covered it. So I'm just going to urge you to see it, if you haven't already. Go see it. My Personal Rating: 9/10",9,0,0,10 August 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," An excellent movie.
","This one's definitely worth the watch. A good balance was found between action and comedy, making this one of the best adventure movies of all time. I especially loved the cave at the end!",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
