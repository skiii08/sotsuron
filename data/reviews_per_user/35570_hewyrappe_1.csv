United 93," Good movie but has minor points
","When reading previous comments about this movie I see a lot of praise. It is supposed to show the true tragedy and courage of 9/11.Well, it does show the courage of all the people on flight United 93, and it is certainly not just a Hollywood money maker. It kept me wondering for hours after the movie, how it could have happened and who in the world would do such a thing.I guess this is especially the case for all American viewers, as I am from The Netherlands.One very big minor to this film for me was the camera work. It is extremely shaky and seems unprofessional (done in order to create a chaotic feel to the movie?). Because of the camera I became nauseous when watching the film and I seriously had to close my eyes for a couple of minutes because I couldn't stand the way the camera view was shaking heavily.. I don't know how many people will have the same as I did but I will certainly not watch the movie again, just because of the poor camera.If it would've contained steady footage etc it would have gotten an 8, but since I believe the camera is sh*t, I'm giving the movie a 6.Hope you find this useful.",4,1,2,29 July 2006
