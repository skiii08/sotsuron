Casablanca," The Lighting Effects
","Casablanca (1942) was directed by Michael Curtiz and started being filmed right after the Pearl Harbor bombing on December 7, 1941. The movie is about two Germans who were killed in the very beginning in Morocco (Then occupied by France). The main character (Humphrey Bogart) obtained Letters of Transit that he was going to use to escape Morocco before the German invasion. This movie came out in the midst of the U.S. arrival in World War II, and the way it showed how the Nazi's would lose and the American's would win in the movie. At the time, people had no idea who would win the war.In the very beginning of the film when they first showed Rick's Cafe, they showed police spotlights that flashed by the main door in a very distinct way. Lighting was specifically used later in the film they had Rick behind a curtain and you could see his shadow and all of the motions that he was making too with inverse lighting effects.",Null,0,1,19 April 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The Graduate (1967) directed by Mike Nichols was one of the first films that became known as a New-Age Hollywood film. Many scenes made this film a New-Age Hollywood film. The whole scene where Benjamin took Mrs. Robinson home and she tried to seduce him. That scene would have broken a rule in the Hayes Code. In a later scene they showed the man and woman in the same bed, and they also slept together. Also a line that was said where Benjmin said 'God damn it' was not allowed had this movie been made 3 or 4 years previous. This whole movie was really about an affair. This movie makes me want to be 20 years old in the late 1960's...",10,1,2,13 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Summary & Opinion
","Singin' in the Rain (1952) is a comedy and musical film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Gene Kelly also stars in this film along with Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen.This film is about a silent film star (Gene Kelly) who is very well known to everyone in the town. He was always partnered with the same female star (Jean Hagen) who had great looks, but had a terrible voice. During the film Kelly meets a dancer (Debbie Reynolds) and he criticizes her because she wasn't in films. Later in the film, the studio tries to transform into a musical studio, and Kelly uses Reynolds' beautiful voice over Jean Hagen's character voice. Hagen does not like her and she tries to take over the film studio.I liked the opening flashback in the beginning of this film that showed how Kelly met Donald O'Connor's character and how Kelly's character got partnered up with Hagen's character.",9,0,1,6 April 2011
