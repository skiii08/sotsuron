Gremlins," There are just three rules...
","1) Buy GREMLINS. 2) Watch GREMLINS 3) Repeat #2 several times Every time I surf the t.v. and I come across GREMLINS, I will put down the remote and watch it til the end. GREMLINS, for its time, was truly groundbreaking. It was E.T., except with really rotten friends and relatives. Well-paced and directed Joe Dante, with unique performances by Zach Galligan and the gorgeous Phoebe Cates, GREMLINS deftly treads in and out of suspense/horror and comedy. (Phoebe Cates' explication of how her father died is still outrageous.) And there are plenty of pitched battles between the good guys and the unruly gremlins to keep the plot moving. Just don't show this movie to young kids around Christmastime. This special edition has a lot of goodies that true GREMLINS fans will enjoy, and the quality is top-notch. Just don't get it wet. I've loved Gremlins since I was a wee girl of only about 5 or 6, and previously my only copy of the film was a tattered VHS, worn out and almost grainy from repeated viewings. I purchased Gremlins on DVD and was astonished at how beautiful the transfer from film to DVD was. The details are crystal clear and the sound is impeccable. Certain small visual details of the movie were totally lost on my old VHS, but stand out gorgeously on this DVD. The movie itself doesn't need further praise from me - it's fun and funny, gory and touching at the same time. My personal favorite scene is when all of the Gremlins are in the movie theater, singing 'Hi Ho' right along with the dwarfs in Snow White. The special effects are amazing for the time, the score was perfect, and Gizmo never ceases to be adorable. A must-buy.",9,0,2,5 October 2008
Shakespeare in Love," A Terrific Film
","Don't be afraid of the word Shakespeare in the title! This movie is not a junior-high history lesson. It's light, funny, romantic, and a totally irreverent look at Elizabethan England. The idea is that Shakespeare is not some grave, great poet, but a young guy trying to make his way in the theatre. He's written good plays, but nothing truly transcendent. The conceit is that an ill-fated romance--the one great true love of this life--with a beautiful, smart woman is what inspires him to write his first immortal play: Romeo and Juliet. The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action. The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown.",6,0,0,2 October 2009
X-Men," Great adaptation of classic heroes.
","While it'd be impossible for any films to do justice to Marvel's legendary team of super-powered mutants, I really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for. The casting was strong, the action was solid, most of the characters were portrayed memorably, and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the X-men. The first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced, but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and old-school X-fans. Hugh Jackman was spot-on as Wolverine, the most iconic X-man and arguably the hardest to cast and Famke Jansen was a fantastic Jean Grey for at least the first two films. Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellan (Magneto), and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique) also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons. The story was a nice update of the comics and followed Rogue's induction into Professor X's school for mutants and Magneto's first big terrorist attack on mankind. All-in-all, a satisfying start to the series. The second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite X-men, including Nightcrawler (whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film), Pyro, and Iceman. The story involves Wolverine's past and the government's attempts to control the ever-growing mutant population. The result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch. For some ridiculous reason, at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last. This was a bad choice that made no kind of sense, upset the films' fans, and severely hurt the quality of the third film. Ah, the third film; a mixed bag to say the least. The plot deals with two classic story lines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary Dark Phoenix. My personal list of complaints is a long one, but I'll just hit a few in this review. 'X-men: The Last Stand' tries to cram two movies' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with. The introduction of the Phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the all-time classics in comic history, and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic, like why an all-powerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist's side and just look menacing for most of the story. The series' former darling, Rogue, is reduced to a brooding plot-nuisance, has no real influence on the story, plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine. On the other hand, more classic characters are given parts such as fan-favorite Kitty Pride and Collossus (both of which had cameos in X2), Angel, Multiple Man, Beast (played nicely by Kelsey Grammar), and the almighty Juggernaut (whose battle with Kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected). But as many characters as there were that made it into the three films, there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny, unnamed cameos in the series, or forgotten altogether. No Gambit, Emma Frost, Sinister, Apocalypse, Scarlet Witch, or Havok to name just a few. Furthermore, the final film's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead, though they do leave us a glimmer of hope. There are talks of Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs and possibly a New Mutants project; promising ideas, but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love. Still, in the end, I really did enjoy X3 as a film as it did have several great stand-up-and-cheer moments; it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series. In the end, whether you're a fan of the comics, the cartoons, or just a fan of sci-fi or fun movies in general, you really shouldn't miss out on these three movies. The series is full of memorable characters, fantastic battles, sly humor, references for hard-core fans, and, of course, the classic X-men social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness. There doesn't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition; but for about $10 a flick, I'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain. Highly recommended set.",8,0,1,5 October 2008
Meet the Fockers," An Inferior Sequel to Meet the Parents
","Given the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Ben Stiller's parents, along with Robert DeNiro back as the hot-tempered Jack Byrnes, you'd think that 'Meet the Fockers' would be a tremendously funny movie. Alas, I was very disappointed. The gags and dialogue don't work nearly as well as in the first film. What kind of screenwriter would think that attaching a fake breast to Robert DeNiro, or having a toddler utter profanities, or giving Greg Focker an illegitimate son, would be funny to watch? The running joke about Greg's last name ran pretty thin in the first film, and in this one, they run it into the ground. It's a shame so many talented actors had to work with such a lame script.",4,1,2,18 September 2008
War of the Worlds," Fun if not entirely true to the book ...
","I have the unabridged audio CD for War of the Worlds from Blackstone Audio and it's very enjoyable. While this isn't true to the book, it is quite fun. The technology was state-of-the-art back then and, while you can see the strings for the martian machines, I still think it provides an enjoyable, if not nostalgic romp. Frankly, I enjoyed this more than Spielberg's newest retelling. Though, that could be from what he did to the main characters. While the special effects of the newer version are lightyears ahead of the original, I found Spielberg's recasting of the aliens as having planned this millions of years ago and putting the machines deep within the earth just plain dumb and removing one of the spookier elements of the book (and original movie). The Orson Well's radio broadcast is also provided and is a hoot.",8,4,7,23 September 2008
Dodgeball," Simple plot, slapstick laughs, good characters
","Really..that's it..VERY basic, no need for thought if you're watching this movie..seriously...You have a great cast of comedic actors portraying funny characters...some good physical comedy as well..Stephen Root's character of Gordon is great! Plus Steve the Pirate..Steve the Pirate? Yea..Steve the Pirate!! cmon..Just the name of that character alone rules!!(and the character himself is pretty damn good) Throw in Rip Torn as Patches O Hoolahan, and Hank Azaria playing a younger Patches (in a wonderful B&W instructinoal video from the 1950's telling Timmy to take a break from that fine lead based paint to learn the wonderful game of Dodgeball) and you got soem serious laughs....and remember..this movie IS stupid and that's the whole point..go with it. To be honest, I resisted watching DODGEBALL because I didn't care much for recent comedies. I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs. He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out 'The Ben Stiller Show' to see that). But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else. I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn. I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball. After OLD SCHOOL and this movie, Vince Vaughn is becoming the Bill Murray of his generation. Most of this movie is predictable and derivative but it keeps the laughs coming. Funny, funny stuff. Check it out.",9,1,2,10 September 2009
