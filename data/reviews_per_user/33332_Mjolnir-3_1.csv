Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars...what else needs to be said
","This film is so good it hurts.The Star Wars atmosphere stands out from the very start when the music is played and the 'Episode I' screen scrolls by to set the scene. This film is so amazing that I find it hard to believe that people can find so many faults with it. The acting is superb from all of the actors and the script fits so well with each person that you could actually believe that Ewan McGregor could be the young Alec Guinness.There are so many things that deserve to be mentioned about this film that they should be listed:1. The plot is so complex that there is always something important or interesting happening. there are so many different plot lines in the film. The main plot is that of the trade federation and their blockade that brings the Jedi in to rectify the problem but the discovery of Anakin Skywalker and the emergence of the Sith also play a great part throughout the film.2. The special effects are unbelievable and help to create worlds that seem completely real and also the characters that are entirely computer generated appear to blend seamlessly in with the real actors. The Pod race is one of the most advertised features of the film and it doesn't disappoint, it was worth the entrance fee just to see the 700mph crashes and the aliens screaming past the stand on the computer generated planet. The battle between the droids and the Gungans was really impressive and the shields mounted on the creatures backs was a nice touch.3. The lightsaber battles between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul has to be the best fight scene in any film ever. These battles were even greater than any between Luke and Darth Vader in the other films as the pace was so intense and the the movement was so fluid. Darth Maul's double bladed lightsabre looked really class in the fightMy only complaints are that Jar Jar Binks added too much of a slapstick element to the film and Anakin shouldn't have had so many lines.Everyone should go to see this film whether they are fans of the other three or not. There are so many differences between the style of this film and that of the trilogy but you can still feel the Star Wars Atmosphere.",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
