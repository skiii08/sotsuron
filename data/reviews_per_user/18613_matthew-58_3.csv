Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best of the trilogy.
","This film will certainly be remembered as one of Spielberg's best because it is filled with the exhilarating fun at which the man has proved himself to be a master.  A previous reviewer seemed to state that it doesn't have much appeal in England.  I don't see why that should be, because BBC1 have just shown the trilogy on Thursday nights and many of the main roles in Raiders are played by British actors.  The character Indiana Jones performs a transformation quite akin to Superman - from quietly spoken college lecturer to tough adventurer.  The music by John Williams is fantastic and exciting action sequences are never far away.  The role of Jones fit Harrison Ford like a glove and Ronald Lacey was perfectly cast to play the Gestapo villain.  My favourite character, though, was Belloq, a big break for Paul Freeman.  A suave and utterly selfish rival archaeologist who would appear to be an intellectual match for Jones.  Part of the success of the Indiana Jones movies can probably be explained by the diminishing quality of the James Bond films around this time and the desire by audiences to see other escapist entertainment.",Null,0,0,28 January 2002
The Terminator," Frightening thriller that defines a genre for a new era.
","I don't care much for Schwarzenegger and actors of his kind.  His attempts at light comedy, for example, have been little short of embarrassing.  This genre is his forte.  His lines are thankfully kept to a minimum and even I have to admit that the sight of the Austrian with his gun and shades is one of the most striking images of modern cinema.We gather right from the start that Schwarzenegger, newly arrived in LA from thin air, is a dangerous proposition when he rips the heart from a punk who dares to challenge him.  However, elsewhere in the same city, another figure arrives in exactly the same way and proceeds to steal the clothes from a tramp and then gets chased by the police.  If the first man is the Terminator, who is the second?  And what will follow?What does follow is one of the most exhilarating rides a cinema audience could ever wish to be taken on.  A pleasantly attractive girl's very ordinary life is turned upside down.  Schwarzenegger is right for the role of emotionless killer and Linda Hamilton is brilliant.  A criticism that might be levelled at the film is that it is slightly sexist, but it could have been worse.  Cameron could easily have fallen into the trap of casting a Bruce Willis type to play her guardian, but instead went for the little known Biehn, who hardly fits the tough guy image and in fact portrays a very human and bruised hero, armed with a police rifle only, who clearly contrasts with the enormous Terminator.  A great dramatic device. 
The Terminator is not the first screen cyborg but he overshadows his predecessors.  His superhuman strength, mechanical advance against everything and complete lack of restraint is horrifying.  He is just a programmed computer with a clear motive and does not kill everybody he encounters.  There are many times in the film when he ignores people, brushes them aside or causes them damage but lets them live.  Kyle and Sarah have to cope with the fact that he can turn up at any time.  Perhaps the most frightening scene in a very scary movie is when they are in police custody, with Kyle in isolation because he is believed to be schizophrenic, and the Terminator turns up, systematically kills every cop in the station and it is simply a case, for the second time, of who will get to Sarah first.The film does have a plot, which is simple and effective for a thriller, but also has a human message which it does not let you forget.  The film has one of the most meaningful sex scenes in a film (how often do you see a sex scene in a film that actually, shock horror, turns out to be the conception of a child, and one that is wanted) and a great twist is that we find Kyle is the father of the man who will become such a threat to the Terminator and the machines that are set to take over the world.A scary movie with hardly any cheap shock moments, a fantastic theme tune and soundtrack and a story less about a murderer and more about a couple of good people.  A film that must really frighten Americans, who seem to think (and this movie confirms it) that bullets are the answer to problems.  Well, not this one.  The Terminator is not a boo-hiss pantomime villain, just a machine that has a task.  He doesn't dwell on anything and when he kills does it quickly and efficiently.  Just what will stop this creature?  There is a little comic relief, provided mostly by Winfield, Henriksen and Boen, but it isn't the annoying comedy its sequel often is.Viewing the film is certainly a disturbing experience, but it is difficult to tear away from.  A film which must be seen by fans of the thriller or sci-fi genres.",Null,0,0,28 February 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A different variation on Raiders.
","The Temple of Doom was not received favourably so the Spielberg/Lucas partnership decided, understandably, to return to the formula of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  As a result, we see the return of two of Jones' friends from the first film, another race against the Nazis for a religious treasure and more action in the desert.  For some reason, an English actor was cast to play American villain Walter Donovan.  We also find that Indiana's father was a Scotsman.  Both father and son are deceived by the allure of an attractive woman, which is a great power women can have over men (so Indiana Jones is only human after all).  I though Michael Byrne was rather good as an ageing Nazi henchman and Marcus Brody becomes the butt of most of the humour (expertly played by Denholm Elliott).  Probably the most powerful scene in any of the Indiana Jones movies comes towards the end, when the callous Donovan shoots Indiana's father (when you watch it you'll see what I mean).  For me, the inclusion of the big star (i.e. Connery) does not lift the film above Raiders (as some people seem to think) because it would take more than a gimmick to achieve that.  This film is too much of a rehash and many of the effects are actually poorer.",Null,0,0,28 January 2002
