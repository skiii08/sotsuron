E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Idiotic and annoying
","This movie relies on touchy-feelie moments from little children and a good-hearted alien to make up for lack of a smart, involving plot. It's disgusting. The alien does lots of idiotic things, the kids do lots of idiotic things, but because everyone is cute, we're supposed to love the movie. Why did a band of idiots have to find this idiotic alien? Why not smart kids finding a smart alien? Completely formulaic: You have the 'bad' adults, and the 'good but misunderstood' children and alien, with no real reasons for anyone to be who they are.",1,31,74,8 March 1999
The Replacements," Surprisingly funny movie with lots of heart.
","This is a surprisingly good movie, with lots of laughs and lots of heart. The ads make this seem like a very dumb jock movie, but there is actually lots of humor, and the core of the story is about these replacement players trying to redeem themselves, gain respect, and attain personal glory. The story is of course predictable, but it's a very enjoyable ride nonetheless.",8,0,1,30 July 2000
