Mission: Impossible III," Horrible; absolutely horrible
","This movie was senseless action. It's not like I enjoyed the original two movies, but I paid the 10 bucks to see this one just to see the precise point at which Tom Cruise's career go down the toilet. The original two had a semi-plot. The plot of this movie was 'Save my wife'.Here are some nuggets which I found especially disgusting.This movie portrays Tom Cruise as an educated man. At one point he does some serious calculations on the window to determine the angle and velocity he would need to 'Sling shot' himself off a building with a random piece of chalk or something that he had handy.In this movie Tom Cruise breaks the 1 minute mile in his sprint through Shanghai.And teaches his wife how to fire a beretta by advising 'Point and shoot'. Pure brilliance.",2,4,7,17 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Best thriller in 3 years
","This movie is the best thriller in three years. The dialogs is fast paced, and I could see that not everyone in the theater could keep up, but those who did had hearty laughs, and could truly appreciate the film. The picture is graphic, violent, but not distasteful. Bruce Willis proves that he is truly a great actor, and this film begins to show that despite his aging, you can see signs of his Pulp Fiction days. Harttnet demonstrates his range as the movie progresses. Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and witty. Everything is tied up at the end, there is not one stone unturned. The story is complete and perfect. The previews gave nothing away, and on a whim I agreed to pay to see the movie. Then after encouraging friends, I paid to see it again. And I will pay to see it again if more people want to see it. It's that good.",10,1,8,23 April 2006
Click," Not the best Sandler, but still funny
","Maybe it's just me. I'm having a hard time adjusting to the paternal role Sandler has taken on in his last few movies. I'm more used to his slapstick immature humor which I soaked up in younger years, and still quote, but like I said, he's still funny.The premise for Click, is the real reason I hold back for my vote. A remote control for life. The theme is putting your family before your job. Good theme, but it's such a strange way to exploit this. The movie touched a soft spot in me though. In its saddest moment, Sander goes from an aged dying old man, but then awakes from a dream, and POOF! It's a happy and Wonderful-Life-esquire, save Stewart, ending.It was OK, funny, and the old school Sander shone through, in some spots.",5,2,13,5 July 2006
