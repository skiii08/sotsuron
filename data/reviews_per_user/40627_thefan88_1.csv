Ghost," The best and saddest movie!!!
","I love this movie to pieces. I can't get enough of it like Dirty Dancing. Two of my oldy all time favorites! This is movie was fun with the comedy (Applause to Whoopie) and the dramatic change the movie comes to. The love scene between Sam and Molly was the best. So sweet and sensual, really declaring their love for each other. Poor Molly though, her heart is ripped from her chest when Sam dies. She had no idea it was a setup, but that's when Whoopie comes in and talks to Molly through Sam. It is really a wonderful cast and such great characters. I thought at the end of the movie that heaven was going to allow Sam to come back to life, but I guess not. With them thinking Sam had no idea that he was going to die. But the ending was really a tear jerker and when he got shot at the beginning. I give this movie a FULL 10! I'm also a huge fan of Tony Goldwyn. Amazing actor! This movie was the BEST and still is the BEST. It deserves all the awards and praise it got. And bravo to the director and producer!",10,12,17,28 November 2002
