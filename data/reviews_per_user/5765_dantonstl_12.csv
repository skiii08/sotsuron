10 Cloverfield Lane," Agent Starbury
",There weren't a lot of black people in this movie.you could only imagine the captives imagination.to me its about a person who cries wolf and does whatever she wants.all the talk about 007 and braids is a key component. Its a little inexplicable while deciding whether the caretaker is doin a good job with his angst for intmacy...while playin the warden and warning the female about which side shell decide to be attracted to most. A woman outside of the house who desperately wants to come in shocks everyone.its like an allegory of vegetating and coexisting with just about anybody...which definitely is what the whole cast is capable of.rooting for anyone in particular probably had to have had me thinking about the guy captive and though he seemed to be following the rules and had had stuff down to the point where he could use the jukebox..play trivia pursuit..and watch movies like pretty in pink...the angst riddled woman had panic and more to come during the epiphany and outcome of this same film.whereas the hallucination and extreme visual intoxications that wrapped the film up noted starting out young and playing the fence for whatever sakes is the profit offered to those who wish to accept...and usually anyone with a vehicle plus some money would be the person of choice for as the beginning showed a person on the rebound,8,0,2,21 May 2016
Child 44," some Daniel Craig film somewhat
","I was surprised how long this film seemed. I like how everyone interacted, and how their was and is a power struggle between officials all during the era of 1940's.... seeing Joel kinnamen again was wild...I was like, um, I just accidentally saw him in st.George, not in person, but on the big screen...in run all night I like him. I was surprised by the way Tom hardy appears on screen...I guess I might have him confused with one of the boys from the x men films...and analyzing him and others I was thinking that I had seen sean Patrick flannerry but moreso the dude starring opposite Andrew the diceman clay in woody Allen's latest movie who played OGGIE. so in regards to watching Daniel Craig films and gary oldman movies..i haven't done that too much lately...and it isn't fun identifying why top billed entertainment hitting the theatre coincidently resembles other previously released films...like in a preview where I see Channing tatum being replayed by James marsden in a VINCE VAUGHN film...",5,2,13,13 May 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Surprised
","Begrudgingly I stalled while going to see this.I was certain it was going to be like a tutorial on working relationships, it was a tutorial on great directing. This film was awesome. John malkovich was great...Ethan suplee was great.. Everyone did great. I can't believe the facts though.87 days of issues out there off the coast of Louisiana...damn.when the movie opened I was waiting to hear if this deployment was off the shores of Sarasota Florida or Galveston Texas... Then boom.Louisiana. the coast guard and satellite location and visuals were super entertaining...I even caught a cameo glimpse of director Mr.Berg dressed up in a business suit. I totally recommend anybody to check this out.",8,0,0,6 January 2017
Passengers," Way better than gravity
","This is an awesome film.i avoided it earlier but to tell the truth it is one of the better films I've seen in awhile.I've seen Jackie,Snowden,Collide and quite a few more and i like this one the best.First i like how after Jim preston is awake he leaves all as is.Even after even three of the passengers are together no one goes to awaken or disturb other people still hibernating. The guy Jim manages to look like a few employees in Provo utah which is neat i thought the same thing about Nicolas hoult in Collide but it was not local and centralized specifically.So where i'm at almost two hours into the movie the generator in the theatre went down. There are moments when Aurora Lane the character played by Jennifer lawrence resembles both joey laurent adams as well as Renee zellwegger.Her name is super because its also a name of a main street almost highway out in Seattle: aurora.So the ship is really kind of screwed up.Everyones life is at stake. The passengers have already had every access available to every part of the ship..there is a critical point of reference going on right now during the blackout...and its life or death. In the meantime a lot is going on with so few characters hence the Gravity reference..plus,well you know how George Clooney ended up.This seems to be almost like that except the two main characters Jim and aurora have already dated and been intimate unlike the professional business relationship Sandra Bullock had had in her film...well its back on hope you like it as much as i did But Don't Get Your Hopes Up.",8,0,3,27 February 2017
American Sniper," prequel to A few Good Men
","hello everybody. well, I was shocked. I did not recognize a lot of these people, which is cool. I think that one marine was like from the newer film Away from the maddening crowd, and this guys script isn't that big, I think he says Congratulations a few times. Then, while I din't believe that I saw Sienna Miller I did see this film in a Eugene discount theatre. There were parts of the movie where when the guns go off it looked as if Negatives were scratched and blotted out to make a Sin City effect as towards Gunfire. Then, an hour and a half into this movie after I ID this cat with a prostetic leg as a dude who works in PROVO, UT and Chris Kyles little brother in Falling apart visually and like really tired, I was ready to leave, so I do...BUT then I remember, oh man, wasn't this Guy killed by someone? DAMN...well, I kind of think that after Christian bale had taken on that big body in American Hustle...this was Bradley Coopers' moment...(in that body).",5,0,8,10 June 2015
Tropic Thunder," would have been the same movie without Robert Downey JR. in it
","This movie got a lot of attention due to Robert Downey Jrs. involvement. I feel the film would have been fine without him in it.It turns out that there will be a Vietnam era film being made. some of the visuals are hilarious. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Matthew Macconoughy are in this film too. I'm not trying to be mean to Robert Downey Jr. because the same could be said of Jack Black also...he wasn't that funny and his participation wasn't that memorable.except for the fact that he had blonde hair. and so, some funny things happen that really aren't supposed to be funny.like when we see the special effects of the dead director being beheaded.BOOM. maybe there aren't too many more shocking and funny moments from there, kinda like the head of the dead parrot in the dumb and dumber movie....",6,0,4,19 January 2016
Prisoners," do i understand this movie
","lets see....pretty plain and awesome performance by Jake gyllenhall on a night that had Ryan goslin on Saturday night live also... I didn't watch this film from beginning to end,and had a lot going on. so it was dark, there were graphic scenes sounds and noises, portions of cruelty and confusion...where in the ending the guys in white suits LOOKIN ROUND, that was Paul dano? right who did that to him? and HUGH he went too far, Jake found a foot in the kitchen sink of a half Hispanic typical native American Jewish brunette and that wasn't it the black family THE BIRCHES....they saw the beat up face that Paul dano had after being KIDNAPPED by HUGH jackman! he freaked out, turnt into a slasher, like could he see a thing? he was so close to escaping? now without being able to explain realistically what this was supposed to be about and what I saw...piece mealing this film had been fine but too far maybe, I had already seen that AWESOME movie that Morgan Freeman had been the kidnapper as well as a sheriff...gone baby gone...and the one with stanly tucci or elias koteas in the cold winters bone? is that it I always forget I give this a six",6,0,2,6 December 2015
Woman in Gold," oh no, from what is this, to oh thats katie holmes
","and then when I just saw away from the maddening crowd I thought That That was Katie Holmes too also? OMG. so voting for this film, man its better than paul blart the mall cop part one and two. its better than pitch perfect one and two. but it was useless. it was uneventful. so like when tom hardy quits his job, and when ryan Reynolds quits his... when I say tom hardy I mean in the child 44 film, here, he quits, and its to get that money, find it, there he needs to find the baby killers...there's no way they interact or are sequels, Unless you opt for PINHEAD somehow someway, because like, whats up with that goldschlager crap flakin out on some painting which isn't awesome, but insured? go on.",1,7,41,1 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," just waiting for yall to find Luke?
","I guess its interesting that Hans solo had a baby that was the leader played by Adam driver...and his mom was princess Leigha? I was trippin. I was annoyed. I was like in one of the awesomest theatres I've ever been to.... the Arlington theatre in Santa Barbara. It was funny cuz they were having all these specials on the menu regarding characters names like jj abrams nachos and Hans solo popcorn.... and the movie happens...I took my first cigarrete break like...when the woman almost was tempted to give away the 88 baby model of r2 d2 for food rations, because she was getting jipped selling mechanical parts . but it blows the most because I don't know what happened...I left. I knew that there was some big headed alien giving direction to Adam drivers character, and that Finn was liberated from his storm trooper existence thus joining the resistance...which is what everyone is called who doesn't exist within the dark lords control....I guess",4,8,9,25 February 2016
Spectre," sucks that it got so many bad things attached towards defining it
","So I haven't ever watched a Daniel Craig james Bond movie before. When I walked into see this, I was like probably a half hour late.Every time hes ever on television, like TNT or SY FY, its not the same, and the mood is so boring that Ide rather be asleep anyway. So I get into the theatre, and like some people were saying, dumb. Daniel Craig got with some chick in a hotel room that was certain that she was going to get killed and even with him there, it would only be temporary like she said: maybe shede stay alive a day or two more....and though I lost track of that storyline....somehow he ends up in a place where he tells the doorman hes Mickey Mouse and bad stuff happens there...kind of like a government Parliament meeting or something. But then some gapped tooth woman dressed up like a geisha becomes the next woman involved in this storyline, and James has to teach her and give her a gun. that about sums up the fun...and though its not a two, I'll go with most other reviewres opinion and rate it a seven",7,4,8,28 January 2016
The Nice Guys," boring....
",Right. I was hoping to avoid the loud larry curly and moe noises I've heard from Mister Gosling ever since seeing him in a place between the Pines....that was the last theatrical release that ide seen him in. I skipped Blue Valentine and forced myself to watch Mobsters INC...or gang squad...something like that..which I liked better. reading other peoples reviews hi lighted what I think they liked about the film....shrugging things off like water down a ducks back...but seriously...money was the main motivation for the guys to be involved in their coexistence. One of the bigger things to upset me were for example the two hit men...Russel Crowe runs into them again and immediately they fight...Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have a fight and there isn't an urgency to reciprocate the painful process of that outcome. Using my imagination and seeing the streets and neighborhoods and cocktail parties were the best part of this film. Things that people thought were funny I didn't...I actually didn't think that I laughed at any point of this movie. Even when the little girl feels bad for one of the hit men that got hit by a van and goes to get Help.....Maybe that was the funniest scene to me? But I don't recommend this movie and it does do its best to give you a vision of that old FREAKY DEAKY and Royal TeneBaum era in your face.,4,7,19,1 August 2016
Warcraft," theatre
","there were so many things wrong with this movie, that I told my buddy how embarrassed I was to be watching it without any of my own children. It turns out that this was a date movie for some and that quite a few people were interested in seeing this. I wonder if they saw what I saw. I didn't know that there would be some somewhat entertaining actors in this film, and good thing for IMDb for being able to search other work that they have done as well... but from what I saw...it wasn't too different from a dinosaur movie that came out not too long ago where the triceratops bros....fight. This does happen to be a little more mature and is even better than the Jungle book...which I know that I definitely should not take any children to see. The generic film is obvious...the theatre and quality of FILM changes multiple times...scenes with JUST THREE people on screen, one dude with a blue towel wrapped around him...etcetera. there's this scene where the KING intimately tells a woman ork to do something...and THOUGH she does it, no one else had had the opportunity to KNOW that that conversation happened amongst them....THEREFORE and ultimately creating a scenario of THEM against YOU with out any explanations...",4,1,4,18 July 2016
