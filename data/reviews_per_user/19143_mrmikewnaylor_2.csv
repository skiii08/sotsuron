Lucky Number Slevin," Was the greatest surprise in films I have had in years.
",This film was very well written and the acting was superb. Without question the best movie I have seen this year and is now in my top 25 movies of all time. I loved all of the acting not heavy on special effects and truly a unique and fresh script. Excellent film! One of my favorite film icons and yes I say icon because he is changing Hollywood Mr. Mark Cuban who would have had this released on PPV and the DVD for sale on the release date. If the DVD had been for sale in the lobby as I left the theater I would have bought it and watched it again over the next few days. That's how good it was. Look for this film to do really well with consumers. STUPID RULE TO HAVE TO WRITE TEN LINES TO BE POSTED! COME ON IMDb GET A LIFE. HOW ABOUT FIVE LINES?,10,0,5,10 April 2006
The Island," Great Film
","This is one Michael Bay's best films. Scarlette and Ewan and a great performance from Ethan Phillips as well as other great actors.You, your friends and family will love this thought provoking film. Scarlette looks beautiful as ever and for those bashers grow up! She is the most beautiful girl in Hollywood today if not the world! Without question. Michael Bay bashers.........well you too are out of our minds. This guy is a great Director and his films are entertaining to 99% of the public. This is who he makes films for. Not the few bashers or critics. His box office performance speaks for itself. No me ........I love to be entertained when I go to the movies. Michael Bay does this every time! Great film go see, in fact go see it twice and the DVD is going to be out of this world.P.S. SJ your number 1!",10,2,5,23 July 2005
