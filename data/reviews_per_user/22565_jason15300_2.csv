Monsters University," amazing and very funny
",very funny movie every family will enjoy! has a lot of reference to monsters inc and before Sully or even Randal was even a scarer. This is set when Sully and mike just met in uni and shows how Sully was trying to be cool and how mike became friends after being enemies. This movie has good surprises i still think monsters inc is better this movie also fits in some puzzles pieces from monsters inc. There are places for improvement of this film but i think pixar has done a good job in making this film there are some sad bit like mike gets expelled from the uni but i like the ending and how its done when mike and Sully get a job as a monster inc mail monsters then to scarers plus you also find out why Randal hates Sully and mike!! This is a good film and it is worth watching with friends and family!,9,0,0,26 July 2013
