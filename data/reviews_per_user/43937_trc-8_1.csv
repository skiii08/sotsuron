Mission: Impossible III," Review of the film IMO
","This is only my opinion but I knew this film was going to be a monstrosity of awfulness as soon as Abrams was put in as director, having seen the film I have been proved right, here I will back up my comments.Firstly from the very start the camera is shaking about and moving like a flimsy tree in the middle of a hurricane what the hell is the point of this it only distracts you from the film, the story - what story??, and ruins the atmosphere, aldo Hoffman is so average in this film, however I would have really liked it if he was cast as a different type of villain say similar to the joker in batman and with a Droopy Dog voice! lol that would have been worth watching, bottom line this movie sucks, the acting sucks there's no passion and it's just not believable another triathlon of a dull-fest brought to you by reality man Abrams, I say Boooooooooooo!!!!",1,6,13,18 May 2006
