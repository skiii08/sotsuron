United 93," Harrowing, Distressing, Brilliant!
","We all know what happened on September 11th, so i wont delve into details. I for one still get upset when hearing about it. Needless to say the world will never be the same again. but is it too soon to make a film about 9/11? I think the answer is both yes AND no. On the YES side, whilst watching the film i couldn't help but think it was still a little too fresh in my memory. But on the NO side, i think we NEED this film, as a way of answering some questions and also create hope. Not everybody on 9/11 died in vain, some of them died trying. they didn't just sit there and wait to die, they fought back, not for their country, but so they could see their loved ones again, so they can carry on with their lives, so things can be normal again.the thing that struck me most about this film was the fact that it took a completely neutral stance on what happened. It didn't demonise the terrorists, it didn't portray the passengers as American heroes. It was as if there was someone there, documenting the whole thing.This film is gut-wrenchingly realistic. Although you know the outcome you can't help but wish it all ended happily. Every emotion, every heartbreaking moment is felt by all, not just on screen but in the audience too.i cannot praise this film enough. Although old wounds about the day may still be fresh, i couldn't think of a more important, more Nessesary film. Not one for a goodnight out on a Friday but it is a MUST SEE. Watch it, be shocked, yet be glad that a film like this exists.5/5",10,0,1,7 June 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Surprising!
","Im not a massive fan of remakes (The Blob and Psycho anyone?). I avoided The Texas Chainsaw Masacre like the plague because the original is one of my favourite horror movies and dont even get me started on The Italian Job. Dont ask me why i went to see this one. The original Dawn of The Dead, even though it was overly long, was still a damn good film! I guess i was curious and i had heard good things about it (unlike Chainsaw).After watching it i can conclude that other than the fact that it's set in a shopping mall this is a very different beast to the original. There's more characters, more action and the Zombies are a hellovalot more scary! This is a cross between the original and 28 Days Later (which was also a damn good film). The fact that the Zombies can now run makes it more believable that they can take over the planet. They're just so relentless.The opening ten minutes of this film are possibly the most disturbing i have ever seen. i cant explain why just see the movie and find out.
Like the original though this movie starts to drag in the middle. Although there are the odd moments that are disturbing or disgusting (or both, the Zombie baby is not a pleasent experience) that keep your attention until the final act, which ditches the horror aspect for all out action.This is where the movies major flaw lies as the end half hour is a mission to make you feel sick and its not because of the gore. Every shot is handheld and after the first five minutes you'll be craving for a break or attempting to keep you pop-corn in. It is very dissorientating and is only for people that dont suffer from motion sickness.The end of this movie does leave it open for a Day of The Dead remake to follow but how it will be done i dont know. As with every remake these days this is the very definition of the term 're-imagining' and if you're expecting the original walk away coz this is a totally different film and a damn good one at that.4/5",7,0,0,28 March 2004
Finding Nemo," Fun!
","You should never be worried about going to see a pixar film because not only do they not make bad movies, they dont even make average movies. Everyone of their films have been both a stunning techniqual achivement but great family entertainment as well.When it comes to the battle between Pixar and Dreamworks, Pixar is the overall winner. Both Shrek and Ice Age were blissfully over-rated as the jokes tried to be too adult and in the end failed misserably.This newest effort tells the tale of Marlin and Nemo, a father and son that have a great relationship yet Nemo cant help feeling his dad is too overprotective (watch the film and find out why). It is when Nemo is taken away by a group of divers that Marlin searches the ocean for him, with the help of the wonderfully stupid Dory (She suffers from short term memory lose).Visually this film is great as it looks as if it is actually taking place under the sea. Unlike the rest of their films, this one is ridicuously cute and it works. The animation also helps in the comical value of the movie. Dory is by far the funniest character as she constantly looks confused and blissfully unaware. The surfer sea turtles are a major plus point too 'DUDE!'The only major downside to this film is that the ending feels rushed. With all of the Pixar films before this there was always a gripping chase that not only showed the hero status of the main characters but the bonding between them. This had the bonding element but a school of fish trying to escape from a net is, frankly, not as exciting as a showdown at an airport (Toy Story 2) or a chase in the rain (A Bugs Life). There are also no outakes to make us chuckle which is missed.But at the end of the day this is family entertainment at the higher end of the spectrum. Forget trash like The Little Mermaid or Pochontas and watch a film that shows the comical side of family values.4/5",8,0,1,10 March 2004
Zodiac," Fincher goes 70's
","Now I would like to take the Mark Kermode route of reviewing. He always states: 'you should go into every movie with an open mind'. Now I frankly find that impossible. I'll always have bias towards certain movies. Despite generally negative reviews, I still insisted the Spider-Man 3 would kick ass. It sucked. I avoided Dreamgirls and the Devil Wears Prada due to the fact that they were chick-flicks. Both turned out to pretty damn good.Now there is a point here. I am a MASSIVE fan of David Fincher, I even think Alien 3, a movie which Fincher himself has disowned, isn't that bad. Se7en is one of the greatest serial killer movies ever and Fight Club, his masterpiece, is just a great great Great film. The Game and Panic Room, although fitting neatly into the constraints of their chosen genres, are damn fine movies. So to say I could go into Zodiac, one of my most eagerly awaited movies of this year, with an open mind, was gonna be a feat more mammoth than Tony Blair's spin Doctor's keeping him popular. I sat down with my girlfriend, turned on the T.V. sat back and watched.But as I was watching, I noticed something. Now it does fit all the Fincher trademarks: every single detail is in frame, each frame is beautifully shot, etcÂ…but, after such a long wait for a new Fincher movie (Panic Room was WAY back in 2002), it almost didn't seem like a Fincher movie almost as much as it did. It was much more. It was a very Mature picture (note the capital M). There's no Tyler Durden spewing his anti-corporate bilge, no Jodie Foster looking shocked and menaced, what there is, is a meticulously planned and expertly executed police drama. Some American critics criticised it for it's lack of action and lack of focus on the murder scenes. This really isn't that kind of movie. If anything it's a character study in the guise of a detective story. By the end of the movie we know each character in and out, their flaws, their motivation, what makes them tick and what scares them. It all just so happens to culminate during the time the Zodiac was active.But it is also a detective story and a terrific one at that! It's so compelling, going from the actual investigation itself to Graysmith's obsession towards the end. As is Fincher's style, he studied each character and every inch of the case for years prior to filming. And it shows. The investigative scenes have never been this good since the days of Serpico and Dirty Harry. It may be 40years passed but this looks every bit as 60's/70's as the movies of that era. It echoes Dirty Harry, The French Connection and all those in between.In so many words, this is up there with the great films of this decade let alone the year. Along with the likes of United 93, Million Dollar Baby and City of God, this is a modern classic. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed but I was in awe of this picture. They should only allow a few select directors make movies and if Fincher churns out movies like this from now on I would be a very happy film-goer. This is sheer brilliance, a masterpiece, a crowning achievement of film making that can rarely duplicated.5/5",9,1,2,2 October 2007
Cloverfield," Fresh
","Well the hype and rumours have stopped now as Clovefield is officially out everywhere. It had an impressive advertising campaign to say the least, creating media speculation as to what the hell it was, (with it's teaser trailer being released before Transformers in the US, giving away very little of the movie, not even a title). Was it about HP Lovecraft's Cthullu? Or Voltron, or another Godzilla movie, a spin off of Lost. Well it's funny that after all this, after all this teasing and hype and everything else surrounding the buzz of this movie, it turns out that all it is, is a monster movie. Good thing it's a bloody good one then.The big question is has this daring and frankly brilliant advertising campaign worked? Does the movie live up to the hype (let's remember that hype is the number 1 killer of any big movie)? The answer is a resounding yes! It's bizarre in the fact that it takes the already used premise of the 'found footage' (used most famously with the Blair Witch Project) yet manages to make it seem fresh and clever all over again.The film opens with a black screen with the words 'Property of the US Government' slapped on it. We are then told, that what we are watching is footage that has been found from 'Area site 447' (Or something) 'Formally known as central park' and regards the 'Multiple sighting of case designated Cloverfield'. What we then watch for the next hour and twenty (also like Blair Witch, this film is very brief) is camcorder footage intended as a document of a going away party for our protagonist Rob. The party is rudely (and shocking) interrupted by a monster the size of a skyscraper. From then on in, all hell breaks loose as Rob and his friends attempt to survive whilst the party's camera man (Hud) documents the ensuing events.It's quite a ride! The last time I felt to tense watching a movie was when I saw United 93 at the cinema! The reason this film works is because we know very little about what's going on. Any bits of valuable information (of which there is hardly any) is found out as the characters do. We are just being taken along with them, experience the frenetic horror as they try to survive and when some of the group die (as the inevitably do in these movies) we really feel for them. These are human characters, not action archetypes. The best move this film made, along with Blair witch and united 93 was to use unknowns. We empathise with them more than a star coz, well, they could be you and me.The monster itself is odd to describe as we only see it in small bits with the only full body shot being saved for the final moments of the film. It ain't pretty and it's nasty. There's always some element in big monster movies where the creature has a sympathetic streak. Not in this movie. This creature is spooked and is taking it's anger out on the city. We see footage of the thing taking down helicopters, pushing over buildings, little parasite like beasties jumping off it and attacking people. It's quite disturbing sometimes too as the group watch their best friends die (one particularly nasty moment sees one of them exploding).This is just a great, visceral experience and not for those who suffer easily from motion sickness. The beauty of this film is that we know very little and I find the idea that there's a sequel in the works a bit depressing. It should be left as a stand alone film and go down in history as landmark in film. If you don't feel physically and emotionally drained by the end of the film (trust me, emotions run high all through this) then you are a cold person. This is a brilliant film and, whilst it has it's minor flaws (as do all great films) it needs to be remembered as one of the best monster movies of all time. Original, fresh, heartbreaking and relentless are just a few words to describe this film but only one need be used: Brilliant! .5/5",9,0,2,4 February 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," Not bad
","MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS!For years to come after the hype surrounding these movies has died down i think people will look at this trilogy and realise that it is good....but not great. From this movie i believe that what people will remember is the ending. Does it leave it open for a 4th instalment? that's for you to decide but the Ending itself is one of the worst i have seen in a film EVER and it ruins what was a very entertaining saga.In short this is the worst of the three movies. That's not to say that it is bad but it is a very agverage film. It does have its moments. The attack on Zion is fantastic but it is the high point of what is an alright movie.
Everything leading up to the attack is great. But the Wachowski brothers seemed to have forgotten what made the first film so great and, instead, turned a brilliantly original concept into your typical sci-fi adventure. This film is also far more cliche ridden than the other two, delving into mushy lovey-dubby territory when you least want it.After the main attack on Zion the movie goes seriously downhill. The final showdown between Agent Smith and Neo is the least impressive fight scene in the whole trilogy, which is a huge anti-climax as it is what many people have been looking forward to. Trinty's death scene was so over the top that most of the cinema started laughing and who can blame them? This movie also proves that Mr Reeves cannot act to save himself. Just look at his pittiful attempt to be upset when the love of his life is lying there dying.A major downside to this saga is that it leaves alot of questions still open. This can be good for people who want to make up their own minds but for a mainstream and mostly passive audience that this is made for it only acts as a anomoly. There are also many questions answered in Enter The Matrix and the Animatrix but for those who have never seen these it acts as another downside. Many people i know could not understand why they were looking for Niobe's ship at the beginning of this movie. Play the game and find out.It is too long too dramatic and an almighty anti-climax to an otherwise great trilogy. But that said the first half is very entertaining and the battle for Zion is awesome. It does not, however, detract from the fact that the last half hour of this movie is overly long and drawn out.3/5",4,0,0,8 December 2003
The Thing," Scared the hell out of me.
","Over the years it seems that my tollerance to horror has lowered and i've noticed that i get scared a whole lot easier than i used to. I blame the excessive amount of splatter movies that i've seen as it has de-sensatised me from that particular genre but has increased my fear at the less noticable horror, namely psychological. The Thing is a splatter movie but it is also more than that. The splatter elements themselves only happen infrequently which leaves the rest of the film to build on the relentless tension and shear terror that the group of men feel as they don't know who the thing has infected. Setting the film in the Antarctic was a masterstroke as it creates a sense that there is no escape. I mean where are the men supposed to run to? This film also shows how computer animation has taken over from the great puppet work that used to be the norm. The effects in this are absolutely fantastic as everything looks so real. Also using the old rubber and latex technique makes the splatter look that more grotesque and gut wrenching (as opposed the CG gore that you find in films like Starship Troopers). This is also one of those films where you feel the terror that the characters feel also. As the decapitated head grows legs and runs across the floor you hear the line 'You've gotta be f*****g kidding' from the character and the audience as a whole. John Capenter is a bizzare man as he has lost touch with his audience over recent years. Some of my favourite movies are his earlier works (this and Assult On Presinct 13 being nearer the top) but his newer stuff really is the lowest of the low (just look at Ghosts Of Mars). When watching his movies you either pitty him or remember that he used to be one of the greatest directors of all time. The latter thought is enough for me to still give him respect and repsect is what the man deserves as without him we wouldn't have Halloween or this masterpiece of cinematic horror. John Carpenter, i salute you. 5/5",10,0,1,8 October 2003
The Exorcist," All time great
","Many people have critised this movie for the fact that it isn't scary. This was due to the hype and, like The Blair Witch Project, didn't deliver to the people that were expecting to s*** themselves. This film is a matter of taste. I'm still waiting for a horror movie to scare everyone but until that day i will tell my own opinion of this film.Contrary to what most people think i believe this is one of the scariest films i have ever seen. And i was watching it with company. The hype had the oposite effect on my. With my friends telling me that it wasn't scary caused me not to expect much but BOY was i wrong.But the sheer disturbing and terrifying nature of this film is not what makes it great. This is proof that William Friedkin used to know how to make a good movie. The acting is superb (Linda Blair giving a genuinly horrific performance), the script is very well written and the whole look of the film gives shivers down your spine.I have only seen the uncut version and i think in seeing the cut version i would have been a little dissapointed. Everything works in this film and the build up racks on the tension as the deamon slowly takes over Ragan (Also see my review of The Thing). The crucifix masterbation scene is gut wrenching whilst the actual exorcism itself is brilliantly done, with both priests oozing exhaustion from every pour.I still can't watch the 'infamous' Spider Walk sequence. This is because of how purely unnatural Ragan looks crawling down the stairs upside down. If you have the DVD version then pause frame for frame whenever the deamon's face appears and see how hidious and scary it looks. Just thinking about it still makes me judder.This is a movie that plays on the audience's fears and it works all the better for it. This is one of the few horror movies that knows how to scare people and it does so with an uneasy effect. I'm sure people have had many sleepless nights over this film and that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.It is a film that can be watched over and over again without getting tired of it. The scare factor does eventually die down after repeated viewing but no matter who you are, you can't deny that after the umpteenth time of watching it still gives an uneasy feeling inside.5/5",10,0,1,8 December 2003
Batman Begins," What a gem!
","For all fans of Batman 1997 was a desperate and depressing year. Not only was it to be George Clooney donning the bat suit (a woeful choice of casting) but Batamn and Robin was to become one of the most universally hated films ever made. It was a crying shame really, as a fairly decent series (the Burton films were works of pure genius) came to cataclysmic end with such a diabolical piece of s**t.Thank god, then, for Bataman Begins, which not only re-invents the tale of the dark night but gives the character the moody edge that the Schumacher instalments sorely lacked. Written by Blade scribe, David S. Goyer, this film puts a fresh new spin on things, showing us events leading up to the creation of the Dark Knight.As the title suggests this is the beginning of the story. We start with Bruce Wayne as a young boy, playing hide and seek. after falling down a well he is confronted by a swarm of bats, that terrify him. We then cut forward 20 years or so to see him in a Korean prison where he is met by a man that calls himself Ducard. He takes Bruce under his wing and teaches him the ways of the Ninja. Once Bruce find out that this group (known as the league of shadows) plans to destroy Gotham, he takes them out. Desiding that he must return to him home town, he gathers all the equipment he can in order to become the fearless vigilante that we all know and love.This film is essentially a two act film. the first half focuses more on the drama, on the desperation of Bruce Wayne. In fact we don't see him in the Batsuit until an hour in. But once he become the Dark Knight, the drama takes a sidestep for some breathtaking action sequences. There's a car chase around the streets of Gotham, a scene of mass pandemonium around Arkham Asylam and the end monorail set piece that is a non stop ride of hard pumping action.This film is a fan boy's dream. It has non of the campy god awful one-liners that made Batman and Robin such a failure. This is a much darker Edgy film and works all the better for it. This could be the start of another beautiful franchise. With Marvel stealing the limelight in recent years, it's good to see that D.C. Comics is making a grand return. Lets just hope Superman Returns will b this good.5/5",10,3,6,20 June 2005
JFK," Creepy
",I saw this movie when i was about 11 and i have to say i didn't understand a word of it. As i am now approaching 19 i can say that this is one of the most nessersary film i have seen although it is blatantly biased.This is one of these films that feels it is a lot shorter than 3 hours in length because it has everything to keep you gripped. It appeals to the cinema goers that demand intelect and the 3 second memorys of the popcorn junkies (as the editing is as fast paced as a Michael Bay movie). And it works.This is a deeply complex movie and you feel as dissapointed as Jim Garrison himself (Kevin Costner) when the final verdict comes in. This film is creepy in a way that makes the Blair Witch Project look like kid's stuff. This is by no means a horror movie but the lengths at which the government will go through to keep the JFK assasination under wraps is as blatantly obvious as it is startling.Oliver Stone's hatred for vietnam shows again in this film (the most noticable portrayals are Platton and Born On The Forth Of July) as it plays a fundimental part in the assasination.There are so many memorable scenes in this film. The most gripping ones being the conversation with Donald Sutherland and the final hour long sumery that Costner gives the the jury. Every performance is top notch and it adds to my feeling of Joe Pesi being one of the greatest actors of our time.If you can get your head around the communist/mob driven/government conspirisy plot then you will find an absolutely amazing and gripping film. The only thing i find sad is that this marks one of the last great performances by Kevin Costner (apart from Thirtenn Days) in what has been a very mixed carrier (The Postman anyone?).5/5,9,0,10,6 October 2003
I Am Legend," Shame
","So we come to the yearly boxing day movie. Last year, bizarrely, it was Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (or what ever the hell it was) and next year it'll be the reboot of Star Trek. This year it was I Am Legend. Firstly, I want to say that this is in no way a bad film and I have certainly seen much worse this year (Hitman anyone?) but it isn't great either. It kinda fits nicely in the middle as one of these interesting non-entities that could've been so much more.Let's get one thing straight, the book is much better. Robert Nevill is, in fact the last person on the planet that is now inhabited by Vampires. They taunt him every evening into leaving his home which, at times, he seriously struggles to resist. But it's the scientific take on the vampire legend that I found most interesting. It attempted to find I logical reason for the extreme allergies to sunlight, garlic and holy water.The movie ditches the vampires and changes the creatures into 'Dark Seekers', mutated humans that are still allergic to sunlight but are far from the intelligent monsters from the novel. They scream and squeak and are, frankly, a bit rubbish. Director Francis (Constantine) Lawrence opted to ditch the men in make-up for entirely CGI creations. His reasons were that he felt they were not believable. Bit mistake. The CGI on these things is truly terrible. In a year when we've had Transformers and Pirates 3, it shows that special effects can now look REAL. These beasts look less than convincing and, thus, fail to scare. How can you be frightened when they look like they're sculpted from play-doh? Will Smith, however, is terrific. Any lesser actor would've failed at the task ahead of him. He spends the majority of the film talking to his dog. Think Cast Away on a worldwide scale. Smith's Nevill is man about ready to break. One particularly moving scene shows him begging a department store mannequin to say hello.The opening scenes are excellent too, with Smith wondering around a deserted New York. Visually, the bigger budget has allowed for more impressive deserted city sequences than the 28 Days/Weeks Later films allowed. Take a look at the cheeky nods to other Warner Bros titles that have been in the pipeline over the years (most noticeably, the poster in Time Square for a Batman Vs. Superman film).Essencially, this is a film of two halves. The first being an excellent post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, the second being your bog standard zombie b-movie. It's a shame as the first half really is very good but all falls apart towards the end. Matherson's book had a very pessimistic view of humanity and his ending really is truly ironic and deeply unnerving. The movie couldn't help being Hollywood. It sh*ts all over the idea as to why it is called I Am Legend, twisting it for a more uplifting finale. It's a shame that Hollywood rarely goes so dark. Had it kept it's ending, the film would've worked much better. Oh well, at least it was better than Constantine.3/5",5,7,10,31 December 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Oh dear!
","PLOT SPOILERS!Does anyone else here think that Paul Anderson should be handing in his P45 right about now? With the exception of AVP and Event Horizon this man should be hung for war crimes against the film industry. OK so he may not have been in the director's chair for this one (not that it would have made much of a difference anyway) but his screenplay is anything but inspired or original.But he isn't the one who should be taking all the blame for this piss poor travesty. First time director Alexander Witt, although having a better knowledge of what it takes to make a better movie, has barely improved on the original, and considering what a mess the first one was you would have thought it'd be quite simple to make a superior sequel. Well apparently it ain't as easy as it looks.As with every bad movie the acting is appalling so i wont even bother wasting my breathe givin it an earful although Sienna Guillory looks stunning as Jill Valantine. The main flaw in this film is the pacing and the god awful clichÃ©s that just come at you again and again and again. Mr Anderson claims, so passionately, that he is a huge fan of the games. so why, in all you mystical wisdom, did you choose to have the Nemesis have a sympathetic streak? Why did you take one of the most terrifying characters from the game and turn him into a hero at the end of the movie? He'd better have a damn good reason to justify that.The timing and the overall pacing of this movie is terrible. rather than use the psychological fear that the games thrived on this movie opts for full on jump tactics every single time. OHH scary. Watch me quiver in my shoes.The movie starts off well enough. Sights of the town being over run were pretty cool, echoing moments of the far superior 'Dawn of the Dead' (2004). But after the movie builds the middle just lags. And then when the climax comes in, Witt chooses to unleash a string of dumb assed action scenes that never once get the adrenaline going. Add to the mix the turning of the Nemesis and you have yourselves a terrible movie.The fact that it leaves it open for a third film is just upsetting. Leave where it is now. This franchise has done enough damage already.1/5",1,2,5,26 October 2004
Mulholland Drive," Lynch at his very best!
","We all love to have our minds toyed with but sitting through a David Lynch film is like having your brain removed entirely. This film is no different as it proves that Lynch (Next to Bunuel) is a master surealist film maker.The film sees a young girl known only as Rita trying to remember who she is. The whole 'girl with amnesia' plot make a lot of sense until about 3/5 of the way through the film when something that can only be described as a Lynchian Pandora's Box is opened. We are then tormented with a demonic homeless man, a mysterious Spanish play house and shrunken people before it all finishes in very dramatic, surreal David Lynch fashion.This film is perfect. There is no other way to describe such a great piece of work. It is flawless because it is helmed by a man that knows everything about his craft and is not afraid to show it off. This sort of film has been sorely missed since his last outing, Lost Highway, in 1996. It's good to see Lynch at his old game and lets just hope in future that he produces more gems just like this.5/5",9,144,260,1 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A welcome Change
","As everyone knows, Tarantino is known for his crime movies, quirky dialogue and foul language. Which is why, with his forth movie, a radical change to what his usual work is is a welcome sight.I never had my doubts that this would be a good movie. I'm am a huge fan of Quentin and i will remain so for many years to come. More so with this movie as he has proved that he is a director that can work on a bigger canvas.This is not his best movie. I still think that Jackie Brown is his best and proves that he can mature with the right material. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were both fantastic films but with it's twisting plot and fantastic style and grace Jackie Brown takes the crown.
Plot was the only major downside to Kill Bill. But what it lacks in structure it makes up for in style and acting. I never seen an actor be so good in this film as when Kevin Spacey played Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects. Uma Thurman i salute you. Her breathtaking performance was enough to make me pitty her despite the fact that mercy does not exist when she's around.Despite it's sheer greatness this will definately not appeal to a large percentage of the audience. If you are squeemish then this is not the film for you. The end half hour is a relentless battle between Thurman and 100 of Lucy Lui's henchmen. So relentless in fact that the majority of it is in black and white to tone down the violence.This is very true to the genre though. If there wasn't that amount of blood when being hacked apart with a samurai sword then it would look unrealistic. It is true to the genre but it has a very Tarantino feel to it. Stylisticly the man has matured in the six years he's been away. We have one fight in black and white, one done in sillohette and one flashback scene told entirely in Japanese anime. This is done by a man who knows what he is doing and is not afraid to show it off.It may not be his best but it is certainly one of the best films of the year. It has emotion, style, blood (by the bucket load), and a tremendous cast that bring the entire thing to life. In the hands of a lesser director this movie would have fallen at the first hurdle but with the driving force of Quentin Tarantino behind the wheel, we have been presented with an awe inspiring masterpiece.5/5",8,0,0,19 October 2003
The Insider," A great Great Movie
","After watching all of Michael Mann's movies i can say that he has never made a bad film. Although i have to dissagree with the bulk of his fans and say that this film is his best NOT Heat (it was still an awesome movie).I think my opinion of this film is slightly bias as i am a Huge fan of Al Pacino but even if they got an equally great actor for the same roll, it wouldn't cause this masterpiece to falter in any way.On the outset this does not look like an amazingly gripping film. The true story of a tabaco executive turned whistle blower doesn't make it sound as if it'll be ripe with action or suspence (which the average popcorn junkie craves). That said it's not action you go to see in a Michael Mann film. Even with Heat he brilliantly put characterisation first before the relentlessly violent action set pieces and he keeps the theme going here.There is no action to speak of in this film, just the agonising tension that builds from the moment Wigand (Russel Crowe on top form) is fired from his job and it doesn't let up.Pacino is his usual shouty self but that is what makes him so great. His role as 60 minutes producer Lowel Burhman is brilliantly played out as a man who can't take no for an answer. Watch his noticable dispair as he realises that they will NOT broadcast the show.There is nothing bad about this movie. Mann's direction is his best since the brilliant and gripping Manhunter. His use of slow motion is enough to make the Wachowski brothers quiver in their boots. Many of my friends complained about the length (over 2 1/2 hours) but these are the pop corn junkies i spoke of before. I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the cinema where the full glory of the cinematography was amazingly apparent.All in all this is a true masterpiece. Interlectual (which is rare in a film today), gripping, and truely truely fantastic in every sense of the word. This is by far Mann's best work to date and if he churns more gems out like this i will be a fan for many years to come.5/5",9,2,3,6 October 2003
The Dark Knight," Wow!
","There's been a huge amount of hyperbole in terms of this movie. While some of the OTT geekyness just needs to be seen to be believed (it's at Number 1 on IMDb's top 250, i mean c'mon), a lot of it is entirely justified. The Dark Knight isn't just a great movies, it's a super-hero masterpiece and quite possibly one of the best films of the decade let alone the year. OK, so i've fallen into the same hyperbole trap but a movie that is gathering THIS much praise (i've counted only two negative reviews so far) must have something going for it.Now there has been much praise over Heath Ledger's performance so let's get that out of the way first. Calls for Oscar nominations are totally justified. He is utterly terrifying as the Joker. The catalyst for many of the major events of the film, he is the soul purpose for the escalation of the downfall of Gotham City and stands to make Batman question everything he has fought for. As Alfred says 'some men just wanna watch the world burn'. That's Ledger's Joker: a clown with a mass murdering, remorseless, pychopathic side who will most likely kill your mother just to laugh at the horrified expression on your face (watch his magic trick with a pencil, funny yet pretty nasty too).But that's not to say he steals the show. While most will remember this film for Ledger, this is primarily a film about the rise and fall of Harvey Dent. A far more engaging character (and villain) than the Joker, Dent's fall from grace is actually pretty tragic. I liked Harvey, whilst a little up his own ass he is, at heart, a man with very similar morals to Batman. He's not afraid to take down the mob and it ain't for the publicity either. But, essencially, this eagerness to be Gotham's 'White Knight' is ultimately his undoing, his actions (and Batman's, and Gordon's for that matter) cause the Joker to push things further until everything descends into utter chaos.The main theme of the movie is that of escalation, as mentioned at the end of the still excellent Batman Begins. My only beef with this movie is that it takes a little while to hit its stride. Whilst the first half hour is certainly still very good, there is nothing (bar the genius heist that kicks off the film) that can justify outstanding reviews across the board. But after the Joker make a surprise appearance at a top notch party ('Goooood evening ladiiiees and gentllllemen!') does the movie really kick off. There is little in the way of full on action sequences (but when there are, they are HUGE) but literally every scene from here on in builds to something bigger, with the climaxes only kick starting something else that's even bigger and infinitely more frightening, and all the time, Hans Zimmer's score pounds in the background. In terms of narrative structure, it really is flawless. Even at 2 1/2 hours long, there is very little, if anything that can be cut from this movie, the plot is THAT tight.Now let's talk about the length. One of the chief complaints of this movie is that it goes on for too long. I call bullshit on that! personally, i could've quite happily sat there for a good while longer i was THAT into the movie. If you notice that the movie is running a little too long for your taste then you're obviously not enjoying the movie as much as you should be. There is never a dull moment in this movie and it's certainly the fastest 2 1/2 hours i've ever spent at the cinema.And speaking of cinemas, this movie really needs to be experienced in IMAX. I'm glad i spent the extra cash to get to London because the experience was just staggering. Not just because the screen was so damn big but the scenes filmed in the IMAX format just looked perfect, filling the entire screen (and that's 20m of screen to fill) the pictures are crystal clear. A screen that size certainly helps to get you into things. No matter where you look, there's just the movie. There's definitely a tinge of disappointment in knowing that when i see this movie again it wont be in IMAX. It just wont seem, well, emersive.But this really is a powerhouse of a movie. I've never shaken so bad leaving a movie before, the adrenalin was pumping that much. I was also glad to see i wasn't the only one. It is a stagering achievement in film-making and also begs the question: do we really want a third one? Nothing can ever top this in terms of sheer bravado and excitement. It expertly manages to make a superhero movie that feels more like and epic crime saga without losing any of the spectacle that makes a superhero movie what it is. Comparisons to Heat are not far off the mark. Further proof that Chris Nolan is one of the best filmmakers working today. As for me, i'm off to book tickets for my second viewing on the biggest damn screen i can find. I feel a trip to Basingstoke coming on.5/5",10,1,3,27 July 2008
Grindhouse," Mixed bag
","The disappointment of the spilt of Grindhouse has now died down and, to be honest, I almost feel fortunate to have seen these movies separately. I am still disappointed that the only trailer to survive was Machete but seeing that on the big screen is still a whole heap of fun. Now this review isn't so much for Grindhouse but my comparison between the two movies and, in the end, which one a think is better.Tarantino has gotten to the stage in his career where he's now become something of a joke. I will be quick to defend him as I am a huge fan but, unfortunately, Death Proof represents the first major dud in his cannon and can be used as a weapon for those who hate him so.I read the scripts for both movies way back in March and from the beginning I thought that Planet Terror would be more fun but when I started reading Death Proof I found myself in my haven: witty, sharp and punchy Tarantino dialogue intertwined with a slow brooding horror that builds to a gory and really quite scary climax that you've seen coming for ages but are powerless to stop. I was reading this first half in awe. But once I moved onto the second half, it was the same old stuff, just set during the day with a different set of women. I then found myself getting bored which was horrifying considering how much I enjoyed the first half.The movie has no plot, just scene after scene of women talking with one or two scenes of horror. This is supposed to be a slasher movie but there is minimal slashing. This makes for an uninteresting and boring film. We don't care about any of these women, in fact, you kinda hope that they'll get butchered because they're just that annoying.The main difference between these two movies is the way they're presented. Both are aiming for tongue in cheek rubbishness that was the staple of grindhouse movies but only Planet Terror succeeds. Robert Rodriguez really nails the tone. Tarantino, however, fails with aplomb. There's a difference between fun/bad and bad/bad. Both movies are deliberately rubbish but only Planet Terror makes it fun. The girls of Death Proof (actually it's pretty much the entire cast) spew out Tarantino's dialogue like cardboard cut-outs of Ben Affleck. Their delivery is not fun/bad but just plain bad. It's over the top and boring with the cast really looking uncomfortable spewing out this dialogue. In fact, it's gotten to the stage now where I'm fed up of people sounding like every Tarantino character ever written. It's gotten old.I still maintain that Jackie Brown is Quentin's best directorial effort because it's the only proper movie he's every done. It has a plot for one thing and quite a complex one at that. But it didn't do so well as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs so what did Quentin do? He made more of the same, with a vengeance in the form of Kill Bill. Now I actually really liked Kill Bill but I was stunned when it went from a 90 minute revenge flick to a four hour epic.It just seems that, recently, Tarantino is getting too in touch with his inner fan boy and seeing as Jackie Brown was made in 1996 it's been 11 years since he's really made a proper film. Maybe Inglorious Bastards will be a return to form. And maybe the failure of Grindhouse will be the kick he so desperately needs.Now with Planet Terror, I wasn't expecting anything less. Robert Rodriguez has made a living off of making films for boys in the vein of a comic book. To date, his only truly great film is Sin City but even then, it still bares all the hall marks of a Rodriguez film. Planet Terror is a brilliant movie for many reasons: 1) it nails the tongue-in-cheek aspect better than Death Proof could ever dream, 2) it has a plot and 3) it was just so much fun.Death Proof was trying so hard with the fact that it was supposed to be rubbish that it actually ended up being genuinely rubbish. Rodriguez has made a living off of making movies that a stupid yet unbelievable fun and is obviously in his element where as Tarantino is actually a respected film maker and seems to fumble with the material. Planet Terror is like a bizarre mix between From Dusk Till Dawn and Desperado. Basically it was just better at being rubbish.It is also unbelievably gruesome. Being a zombie movie you have to expect a level of gore but if this wasn't so over the top I'm sure the American censors would've had a problem with it. Heads are broken open and brains eaten, a hospital orderly has the front of his torso ripped off to gain access to the offal inside, and we also see Quentin Tarantino (who cameo's in the movie) have his penis melt off. You don't know whether to laugh or squirm are the gory bounty that unfolds through every minute of this movie. But it's all so blissfully over the top. When someone if shot, blood spills at impossible volumes and looks more like baked bean sauce than actual blood.It is also very funny, in a sick kinda way. Gags like sausages being mistaken for innards or a dog being accidentally splatted by a truck and spraying two unsuspecting survivors bring out cringe worthy giggles that were never to be found in Death Proof.Who knows, I may watch Death Proof again and find that it actually is a pretty good film but until that day I will be recommending Planet Terror to those who like their horror in the same vein as Braindead: Splat-Stick Planet Terror Â– 4/5 Death Proof Â– 2/5",8,0,0,12 November 2007
Saw," The most disturbing film for years
","As an avid horror fan i can safely say that the majority of horror movies released today are average at best. they are either crap yet fun or just plain crap. Even films such as Cabin Fever, although trying to go back to the original 1970's style of horror, fail to hit the mark. Which is why i was stunned by this little beauty. If you thought serial killer flicks could only ever b as good as the next Ashley Judd thriller then you were gravely mistaken.It tells the story of two men (one a photographer, Adam, and the other a doctor) who wake up to find themselves chained up in an old abandoned warehouse, With no knowledge of how they got there or why. Then a mysterious killer by the name of Jigsaw informs them the the doctor must kill Adam by 6 o'clock or his wife and daughter will be killed. Although the premise is very basic, after the opening the majority of film is played out in flashback informing the audience of how the characters got there and looking back at past killings Jigsaw has committed (the barbed wire murder will make you sick to your stomach).Shot on a budget of only $1,000,000 this film looks as professional as Silence of the Lambs and as grim as Se7en. Although at many points the director seems to delve into MTV syndrome (look at anything by Michael Bay and you'll know what i mean), the overall tone of the film is probably the bleakest in film history. There is nothing pleasant in this film. No comic relief, no assurance that everything will be OK, just twist after twist the keeps you guessing till the very end and even then things look pretty bad. If your movie preference is that of soppy rom-coms or chick-flicks this is definitely not for you. I have a fairly high tolerance for this kind of stuff but even this tested me.This is a truly great and utterly disturbing film that deserves to be up there with the great horror films of our time. This is pure nightmare inducing material. If they were as well made as this gem then i would openly welcome many more movies like it. Apparently there is now a sequel in the works set for the end of this year. Lets hope it works as well as this.4/5",9,1,3,12 February 2005
The Descent," Kicks 28 days later's ASS!!!!!
","I have found it hard to find anyone that hasn't enjoyed the joy that is Dog Soldiers. It's grim, gory, action packed and very very funny. But for all it's wonders, it is (forgive me for saying this) very flawed in places. Thank god for The Descent, a film that takes all the good points of Dog Soldiers and amplifies them ten-fold.If Dog Soldiers is Six guys, one house and a whole lot of guns then The Descent is Six girl, one cave and a whole lot of pain. Despencing with the pitch black humour of Dogs, The Descent plays it completely straight, working more on the sheer terror of the situation rather than the quirky one liners.Although this is most definitely a creature-feature, the first half of the film focuses very much on, not only the characters but the aspects of primal fear that are inherit in all of us: claustrophobia, paranoia, and most importantly, the fear of the dark. We are with the characters every step of the way and, as such, we empathise with them, sharing their dread, as the situation worsens and their relationships begin to crumble.Director Neil Marshall adds to this tension in the first hour by only showing us fleeting glimpses of the 'crawlers'. Marshall is a man the truly knows how to scare the living sh*t out of us and does so with expert precision. Only minutes into The Descent, he has audiences throwing popcorn in every direction. But this is just a mere taste as to the pain that'll unfold.And there is a lot of pain in this movie. Once the 'crawlers' finally make their grand entrance (and what an effective entrance it is) the movie takes an unsettling turn for the worse, turning an already dire situation into a truly epic nightmare. And there is gore...lots of it! Although we see the monsters in full for the second half (often a HUGE mistake for this kind of movie) the film still has the audience in its clutches, ripping away every aspect of comfort, leaving the viewer feeling bare and vulnerable, very much like our characters.If feeling deeply uncomfortable for an hour and a half isn't your sort of thing, then avoid this movie at all costs because this is not for the faint hearted (or the squeamish). But if being scared beyond all belief IS you thing then this is a must see! Like Saw, The Descent has no saving grace, no Dog Soldiers style humour to ease us, just pure, relentless, unadulterated terror, complete with it's very own downbeat ending.Hurry up Neil and makes us another! 5/5",9,2,5,7 November 2005
Inside Man," Boring
","I don't have much to say about this film so i will keep it brief. Needless to say i found this film dull, boring and thoroughly tedious. It's kinda frustrating too due to the fact that so many people liked it. Am i missing something? Did i see the same film? I'm not saying its a terrible film, just...well painfully average.The only thing that stopped this from being a total waste of time was Denzel and Clive. Both performances were good and in effect saved the film from being a waste of money. And Jodie Foster? Well, lets just say she doesn't play the hard nosed b*tch very well.All in all, a disappointment. Sorry for the shortness of this review but id rather spend my time gouging my eyes out with a rusty spoon.2/5",3,3,7,18 April 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Enjoyable But Not a Masterpiece
","There was no doubt in my mind that Reloaded would be a patch on the original. As an avid fan of the first film i felt it nessesary to see this film.As a film on it's own it is fantastic but, as everyone will no doubt do, it is only average compared to the first film.The fact that the original had already set up the story line there was never going to be a plot good or compelling enough to equal the first film's grand nature. That said the actions scene in this lesser sequal are far more impressive than anything the first film had to offer (although it is blatantly obvious when the SFX take over from the amazing wire work).The only downside i feel with this film is that it takes far too long to get going. The major fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths doesn't take place until an hour into the film. before this point there is a god awful rave scene in which scantally clad rebels delve into dirty dancing territory and a confusing if not mind boggling chat with the oracle (can't explain, too tedious and time consuming). But after putting yourself through the cumbersome exposition you get some the greatest fights in film history. including one of the best car chases i have ever scene (next to Bullet and Ronin).But again after the midle hour the film starts to lack again in what appears to be the anticlimax of the year. And then were are treated to Neo's chat with the Architect (which sounds like the actor has swallowed a thesaurus, SPEAK ENGLISH).But what i have come to realise is that this movie and The Matrix Relolutions can be classed as one film and i believe that splitting it into two sittings was the best way forward.It is easy to say that Relolutions will be one of the best films of the year. Sadly Reloaded isn't. I can't blame it on the lack of philosophical value as the first film mangaed that to the max but the rushed ending makes you feel as though the directors are just wanting you to get to Revlolutions and forget about this one as soon as possible. Which is a shame because this could have been a great film had they spent more time and thought on it.Gripping experience but deffinately lacking, and it shows. That said it is still one hell of a good ride.4/5",7,0,0,29 September 2003
The Fountain," A unique experience
","I am a fan of surreal. Yes i am guilty of enjoying things that make little sense and are open to interpretation. I find it a pleasant release from some of the formulaic drivel that comes out of Hollywood from time to time, spoon feeding the audience with endless scenes of exposition just to let them know where they are in the story. But with surrealism, the movie is very much a different experience to those that enjoy watching it. Look at pretty much everything by David Lynch.I am also a huge fan of Darren Aronofski with Requiem For a Dream being the greatest anti drug movie since Trainspotting. Surrealism was a key influence on his debut Pi, so we already know the man i capable of tackling such weirdness.The Fountain is no exception. yes, it is weird, yes, a lot of the time is appears to make little sense and yes, in aims to confront the audience rather than comfort. But this is a totally different surrealism that we witnessed in Pi. This is a different Aronofski all together. And, quite simply, it is one of the finest films of the decade.There have been few cinematic experiences that have made me want to weep with joy but this is one of. The last time i felt so elated was when i watched Magnolia for the first time at 17. I felt so...involved, beside myself with emotion. Sounds cheesy, i know but i couldn't help but be so moved by it. As a friend of mine put it: 'you don;t watch the film, you FEEL it'. And he couldn't be anymore right.This is a collage of images rather than a concrete narrative structure. Like Dali, Aronofski tells a simple story, that of love and loss, using unconventional means. The result is awe inspiring and made me ask (as i did at the end of Magnolia) why movies are very rarely this good.With a movie of this calibre the performances are incredible yet it's the direction that's the biggest surprise. Gone is the frantic cutting and hectic pace or Aronofski's previous efforts. This movie takes its time, effortlessly so, looking more akin to Kubrick. Patience is required yet the result is all the more rewarding. And it looks beautiful.I understand wholeheartedly why there are those that hate this film but they can't seem to appreciate the majesty of it. I loved it and as soon as i finished watching it i wanted to watch it five times more. I believe each repeated viewing will bring further rewards. It ain't for everyone but then again, it wasn't made for everyone.5/5",10,1,3,15 January 2008
American Gangster," Ridley Scott's Goodfellas
","I'd been looking at the reviews for this film recently and I was quite surprised. It was touted to be one of the biggest films of this month, if not the biggest. I mean it has Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in it and it's directed by Ridley 'Alien' Scott. What's not to like? Well quite a bit apparently. There have been many good reviews but none have been what I was expecting with a creative team of this calibre. I was expecting greatness, comparing it favourably to recent gangster movies like The Departed. But it was met averagely, many critics saying it is good but it brings little to an already established genre.I disagree. This is better than The Departed. It was only after looking at it's average reviews that I found that the general public seemed to love it. It seems as though the critics were out of touch with the public. This is a masterful film that keeps the viewer enthralled. It is 156 minutes long but it never seems boring, always keeping you on your toes as we move from the mob to the police to the corrupt cops and innocent bystanders that get caught (literally) in the cross fire.It tells the true story of Frank Lucas, an African American mobster during the late 60's/early 70's who tries to take over the New York drug trade. He travels to Vietnam and finds a way to transport pure heroin via the American Military as they fly back from the war. The result brings him a stronger product that he sells for a discount price. He makes millions and slowly but surely, he takes of the streets of the city.Hot on his tail is Narcotics Officer Ricky Roberts , dead set on bringing down organised crime and police corruption. He is a failure as a husband and a father and has links to mob members who give him the occasional snippet of info when he needs it. Then he stumbles across the path of Frank Lucas and from there on in, things get messyÂ… This is a fairly graphic film. There is violence from the start and very hard drug use. I was personally astounded at the detail they were allowed to show with the shooting up scenes and not in a good way. Graphic depictions of drug use have always made me feel more uncomfortable than violence and here is no exception. We see needles enter infected wounds as the users lean their heads back and gasp, loving the sensation it gives them. It's a sad sight of a sad time, where evil prays on the desperate without any feelings or remorse. In one particularly harrowing moment we see scenes of Lucas celebrating Thanksgiving with his family inter cut with images of his users lying dead, OD'd off his 'product'.One thing we learn about Frank Lucas is that he was smart, calculated, very charming and totally evil. At one point we see him chatting casually with his brothers in a local diner before walking out and shooting a rival gang member in the head, in broad daylight, in the middle of the street. He walks back to where he was sitting before casually asking 'what was I saying?'. His brothers, much like the audience, are in shock.In terms of what makes this film good, the main thing is the different direction Ridley 'Alien' Scott has taken. He is a director renowned his focus on visuals, creating a perfect pallet of depth and meaning from a single image. In this film though he decides to ditch his trade mark style for something, ultimately, more gritty, down and dirty. Traces of his trademark still exist, for example: the Thanksgiving montage. When we see Lucas and his family the colours are light and vibrant, reminiscent of their mood. When we cut to the dead junkies, however, everything is dark and saturated of colour, with blues, blacks and greys being prominent. But this is not the primary aspect of the image and become more of a background detail. Very unlike Ridley Scott.But this is only there for those who have either studied film or are out looking for it. For the rest of us, there is just a hard hitting and powerful gangster film. The visuals lay back and let the story and performances take over. And what a pair of actors they have in the lead roles.As Lucas, Washington creates a man you both admire and loath. In many ways, his rise to power is reminiscent of the typical American dream, albeit a twisted version of it. He is smart and calculated and his charisma will make any woman swoon. He is also brutal and psychotic. You loath a man like him because he is the most charming amoral character you are ever likely to meet, and he kills people as easily as he makes money.As Roberts, Crowe is a totally different beast. He's messy and disorganised. He has a wife who's left him, a child he hardly sees and, being one of the only honest cops on the beat, is hated by his colleagues. Crowe's ruggedness, designer stubble and awful haircut almost make you believe that we're not watching Russell Crowe but a real cop who's lost everything but still has his pride. The great thing about both these actors is their ability to get lost in their characters. You believe they are who they're portraying.In short this is just a great movie. Accessible to anyone and written and directed with true gusto. This is essentially a cops and robbers movie but with Washington, Crowe and Scott on bored they have crafted a movie that certainly deserves some attention when the Oscars come calling.5/5",10,0,2,20 November 2007
Inception," Nolan's Masterpiece
","Where do I start with Inception? To delve into the plot would actually take away the film's effectiveness but say too little and it begs the purpose of this review at all. So, on that note, there will be certain, but non-major, plot points spoken about. Some very minor spoilers (again, not plot ruining) but if you wish to go in knowing as little as possible (which is the best way, trust me), then it might be worth skipping the review.DiCaprio is a gent called Dom Cobb, the best extractor in the business of subconscious espionage. Extraction is easy, however when Dom is asked to attempt Inception, the tricky practice of planting an idea into their target's mind (it is explained why it's more difficult but I can't explain it here), the stakes are raised much higher: there's the promise of finally getting home to his family, of whom he has been in hiding for an undisclosed but lengthy period of time.One thing to say about Inception, apart from how truly, utterly brilliant it is, is that it is probably the most original film since The Matrix back in 1999. I think one of the key components that will either invigorate audiences or turn them off is the fact that it's not based on an already established name, be it an adaptation or a sequel. That in itself is refreshing enough but the genius conceit of Inception is that it believes so much in the world it's created that it leaves very little catching up time for the audience. The rules for Extraction and Inception are laid down thick and fast and woe betide the fellow that insists on a pee break. Miss even two minutes of this film and you're lost.But in laying down the rules, the second half of the film (in which DiCaprio's team implement the Inception heist) acts them out with aplomb. We have dreams within dreams within dreams and things that happen in one plain of reality directly effect that in the next, for example: whilst the team is unconscious in freefall in one, in the subsequent dream they're all weightless, and whilst a van in which the team is asleep tumbles down a hill, the gravity in the next starts to shift (giving us that awesome corridor fight from the trailer).Christopher Nolan really has taken everything he's learned from making mature adult blockbusters and utilised it here with maximum effect. To say it's thinking man's blockbuster is understating things but, unlike the Michael Bay's of this world, he does not feel the need to treat his audience like kids. Whilst Inception may hold a 12A certificate, that's not to say it's for children of that age, not because of any of its content I must add, just that the plot, which is perfectly written and executed, will just be too much for those that crave robots hitting each other.But, that said, there is a lot here that will appeal to that demographic. The visuals, whether it is during much of the trippy dream imagery or the outstanding action sequences, are spectacular. Whilst grounding much of the dream world in reality, that's not to stop Paris from folding in on itself or have gravity shifting from wall to wall.But, as stated, what makes Inception work is it stubbornness to stick to it's established rules. So ten hours in real time equates to a week in the dream world but a dream within that dream equates to six months and a dream within that dream equates to ten years and so on, so whilst moments that are instantaneous in one dream, the team knows that they'll have around twenty minutes to get things done in the next, etc. Once you get your head around it, you have to marvel at how well the filmmakers have been able to juggle the different time frames within the dream world. It pays off in spade and once everything comes together in the end (of which it does in outstanding fashion) the satisfaction of staying with Nolan and his convoluted but never confusing mind is like nothing I've experienced in the cinema for years.Inception is literally like nothing you've ever seen before. A heist movie with some serious balls, this is, hands down, Christopher Nolan's finest accomplishment. There will be those that wont like it (it has already garnered some vehemently hostile criticism) and I can understand why but I was enthralled by not only the spectacle but also the sheer bravura at its ideas.This is Nolan's masterpiece.",10,7,14,18 July 2010
The Island," Typical Michael Bay
","I feel somewhat disappointed in the circumstances in which i saw this film. There were two choices as i stood in the Que of my local cinema, one being Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and one being the new Michael Bay movie. Alas i was overruled by my fellow friends and i am still yet to see the new Delight from the unquestionable Depp/Burton collaborative team.That's not to say i didn't want to see this. For all his flaws, Mr. Bay can produce some entertaining popcorn fodder. Both Bad Boys and The Rock had their moments and Armageddon is still watchable (albeit only on the odd, rare occasion). I'd rather not mention Pearl Harbour (notice the 'U' is intact) or Bad Boys II although they, too, had some pretty impressive moments.The Island, on the outset, looks like a break from the regular Bay/Bruckheimer mold (The fact that old Jerry ain't involved in this one is a huge step in the right direction). It deals with some very interesting themes (Cloning. Should we/Shouldn't we?) and features what i call 'guenuine' actors rather than the next pretty face to appear on MTV.And it works...well almost.For all it's promises, this is, at the end of the day, a Michael Bay Movie, and however high my hopes were, they all came crashing down on that basis. What is it with this guy and cutting every 30 seconds? I may not be in the business Michael but i know that cutting on this magnitude is only a hindrance. There is no need for it so, in future DON'T DO IT! It is also apparent that he feels more at home when the carnage starts. The first act of the film feels..not rushed but haphazard. The only truly engaging scene, i felt, was McGreggor's 1st encounter with bad-guy of the year Sean Bean. His constant questioning of the environment around him provides a brief glimpse of the turmoil that's about to unfold. But this is not enough i'm afraid (the scene happens some 10minutes into the film). Until things start going tits up, the film buckles on it's own premise, unsure of how to achieve what it set out to do.Once the pace picks up however, Bay is in his element. In a bizarre twist, the major saving grace of this film is Bay's precise knowledge of how to blow sh*t up. An boy does he put this knowledge to good use. Explosions, car chases, more explosions, more car chases. Once our Protagonists are on the run it seems that nothing is safe from bay and his pyrotechnic team. And although you can't help but titter and the extreme amount of collateral damage caused, you can't help but stare in awe at the raw intensity of the middle act.And one can't accuse Bay of lacking in style. This film is full of it. Even when the film lags or feels uncomfortable (and with the excessive cutting you bound to feel uneasy) it is still stunning to look at. The noir drenched look of the real world as a dark, dinjy, dirty place. The calm, paradise-esquire feel of the cloning facility. All these aspect enhance the emotions of our characters, and many a camera technique shows this too.It is the third and final act however that causes the audience to crave something more. The man on a mission side of things seems tired and used, as McGreggor sets out to save his fellow clones. The clichÃ©s are as transparent as they are obvious and, in all honesty, a bore to watch. By the time the final cringe-worthy moments arrive i had had enough.It is as if it is 3 films as opposed to 1 as it comes off as a Sci-Fi-cum-fugitive-on-the-run-cum-man-on-a-mission mish-mash. You can't blame Bay for trying, but what he has here is something that could've been so much more. Not a complete failure, but still a disappointment. A truly promising concept has been turned into your generic action yarn.3/5",5,0,0,18 August 2005
