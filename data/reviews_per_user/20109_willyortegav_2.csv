Ford v Ferrari," Absolutely brilliant. Top 5 of the year.
","Honestly, I went to watch this movie with no expectations, and I regret nothing. It was totally worth it. Brilliant storytelling, beautifully shot, masterfully acted, and surprisingly emotional. Christian Bale and Matt Damon delivered an outstanding performance. Although I don't know anything about cars or didn't know much about the real story, I absolutely enjoyed this movie.",10,1,3,23 November 2019
