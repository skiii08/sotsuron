Black Swan," A psychological thriller blockbuster dressed in an art-house tutu.
","A modern blockbuster art-house thriller, completely compelling whilst also being alienating and purposefully distant. One of the most accurate and frightening depiction of insanity, obsession, and commitment to art in modern cinema. All set to the double-backed story of Swan Lake, with masterful performances by actress Natalie Portman and director Darren Aronofsky. You will be hard-pushed to find a better modern psychological thriller.The pacing in Black Swan is impeccable, you cannot help but be swept up in the madness of the 3rd act. Natalie Portman's acting is certainly 'best actress' worthy, which is surprising considering Black Swan is a rather racy and dark film compared to the normalI say that it is dressed in an art-house tutu because while the themes and allegory at play and the subject matter is more akin to art-house, the way in which it is presented is certainly not. It is an accessible, entertaining, crowd-pleasing film. This isn't a flaw, I wish more blockbusters did the same. In fact Black Swan works excellently as a portkey for art-house cinema virgins - Persona is an obvious recommendation for anyone who liked the Black Swan's themes of identity and the dissolution of identity.Oh yeah by the way too, I wouldn't watch this with anyone else. Do yourself a favour and watch it alone.",9,2,4,26 May 2014
Sucker Punch," Zach Synder's visually inventive but utterly stupid exploration of fantasy.
","Sucker Punch is a film that seems to precisely targeted at teenage boys who like video games and want superficial action and lots of cleavage. You cannot fault Zach Synder's unique but increasingly drilling visual style, and never more so than here in Sucker Punch; the colours are simultaneously lulled and saturated, the blacks are blackest, the slow motion in abundant, and camera work is inventive and kinetic. However not to make a film visually dazzling is near impossible for a film with a big enough budget to spend on CGI, which Sucker Punch certainly has, all £82 million of it (and that certainly went all on visuals because the writing must of cost nothing and the acting must have cost even less than that). This worked well in Watchmen, because the visuals are meant to be comic and dark, the story is already written so you cannot go too far wrong, and the film works as actual satire on comics so the acting can be excusably bad.The fantasy sections play like increasingly ridiculous video games, and are written like Zach Synder just combined random words together - for example, clockwork stamping WW1 German zombies - and don't even play as coherently as the dream levels in Inception. The ending seems to subvert the traditions of cinema (or at least action films), this is likely intentional, but soon reprimands any surprises with quick and lazy 'look this film is actually written' scenes which work up to nothing without the necessary build up.I can also not tell if Sucker Punch is blatantly sexist or a feminist statement - which is never a good thing for a film to be. Overall if you like the poster for Sucker Punch, with all its breasts, bums, crotchless pants, robots, guns, and dragons, then you will likely enjoy the film - if not forget it even before the credits have even begun.Those who love the film will likely call any critics or skeptics pretentious, which is fine, they can.",5,1,7,1 June 2014
Gravity," A Newtonian ballet of epic thematic proportions.
","Believable characters with an effective but minimal plot allows tone, pacing, and atmosphere to rule over. Sandra Bullock's performance ties Gravity to earth, making - what could have been Avatar - surprisingly emotional. An all but technically perfect film - Gravity shows the glory of cinema's future, whilst paying homage to the greatness of the past - a truly transcendent experience. Visual metaphors, symbolism and allegory are present throughout, giving a rich thematic and even philosophical depth to Gravity for those with open enough eyes to see. Many people complain about the few sparse scientific inaccuracies and forgotten that they aren't watching a NASA IMAX movie - which is itself a testament to the visual wonderment that Gravity is. Also in case no one knows yet, superheroes aren't real and cars don't change into robots in real life.Alfonso Cuaron's signature sustained shots force the viewer to not break away; no film has ever done immersion quite like Gravity before. You hear the word 'awesome' thrown around a lot nowadays, but Gravity was the first ever film which truly struck awe into my spine. Yet at the heart of Gravity is a deeply human story about accepting, not only death, but life.",10,1,4,27 May 2014
Midnight in Paris," Little more than an inventive romcom - even Owen Wilson is in it.
","An enchanting Parisian ode to the artisans of past. The ensemble cast is expertly used, making the audience simultaneously recognise the on-screen talent and the talent on-screen. Unfortunately Woody Allen's direction is utterly stagnant and unevocative - I would have much preferred an 'In the Mood for Love' approach to the film. But instead, a celebrous romp. Owen Wilson, I find placid and stolid (again), maybe good for the role, but maybe the wrong role for the film.Also, for a film about a man deeply entranced and influenced, Woody Allen's script is utterly uninspired and unevocative and only truly reminiscent. Dissolving into a half-assed abstract love triangle. Great for any lover of art (references), Paris and the 1920s though.",6,1,1,26 May 2014
Moulin Rouge!," Mad. Mad. Mad. Dazzlingly Mad.
","Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is one of the most divisive films of recent memory, thought visionary by some and stupid by others - and both by me. One thing is for sure though, Moulin Rouge is one of the maddest movies I have ever seen. The music, production design, and costumes make it ravishing if not ironically uneasy on the eyes. The direction could do with a bit of polishing, I would have liked much longer and more fluid takes for example, to take in the wonder that the film was visually for example.The film was pacey enough for me not to worry about the time while I was watching it and entertaining enough for me to smile and chuckle along.But overall, Moulin Rouge is definitely only one for those aficionados in everything Luhrmann.Lavish. Raunchy. Ridiculous. Oddball. Melodramatic.",7,0,1,26 May 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the greatest, an unparalleled vision of science, evolution and man's place in the universe.
","Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus; philosophically powerful, technically breathtaking, narratively thrilling, and artistically unparalleled. The visuals are timeless in their organic construction and the audio is Kubrickian baroque. The score. The score. The score. 2001 changed the way music was done in cinema, it was now a necessity. And music has never been used better than in 2001.The film's clearest message is about the underlying human nature that pushes us from using bone tools to interplanetary spaceships - the progress of man – but that is just the surface. 2001: A Space Odyssey came at a time when man was on the precipice between the greatest achievement in the history of humanity and total predetermined nuclear apocalypse. Both are the gifts of science and progress, hence both are the result of man doing or undoing – 2001 offers nothing more than step back and view us for what we are, what we have become, and what we might become. Certainly the film I feel most comfortable saying in is one the greatest.",10,1,2,26 May 2014
The Artist," A less-than-fitting tribute to a great age of innovation and artistry.
","A unfitting tribute to the age of silent cinema and the rise of the 'talkies'. The Artist is a surprisingly funny and dynamic film considering its limitations, although it is surprisingly thematically one-dimensional considering it is ultimately a meta-commentary on the film industry. And, of course, it isn't nearly as good as the real masterpieces of silent film. It's score is obviously designed to be cliché and dated, but I would have liked it to be less so. The cinematography doesn't feel as powerful and beautiful as some of the great innovators of cinema, like Joan of Arc, Sunrise, Nosferatu, or Man with a Movie Camera. Overall, The Artist is an okay if stilted tribute to a bygone age - but don't expect the greatness of the real thing; in the end it is basically like an good Elvis Tribute act. But then again, it is the only film trying, so...",7,1,2,26 May 2014
The Fountain," A spectacular and powerful film, if not unfocused.
","Darren Aronofsky does well to create a visually stunning film, along with Clint Mansell's potent and effectual score. I would see unfocused as a fair criticism of The Fountain, but it is also ambitious, poetic, effecting, interpretive, and spurs debate. A second viewing after watching supplementary 'explanation' videos helps enhance and focus the experience, allowing the viewer to pick up on repeating visual nuances and construct an interpretation themselves. I would like to have seen many themes and ideas explored other than mortality and coming to terms with your transience. While it is often compared with Cloud Atlas, its only similarity is in premise; the execution is of a very different style, the thematics are similarly 'deep' to those new to experimental cinema but are vastly different in detail, and the method with which interpretations can be drawn are much more literal. Both seem to be hated by critics, but both are powerful epics.To call The Fountain a failure is understandable, in essence it is, but only because its ambitions are so infinite that if it did meet expectations it could quite easily be one of the best films of the 21st century.It was likely cut and played with hugely from Aronofsky's initial plans. It does feel like a 3 hour epic that was cut into a 1.5 hour risk due to reasonable worries about box office. Maybe one day the film will be revisited and a very extended cut will be released, that will be the film Aronofsky wanted, intended and wasn't allowed to make.It is also one of the few films that I do truly believe are underrated by critics - for which I give it a 9 rating, out of sympathy, over a 7 or 8 star review.",9,1,3,26 May 2014
Mary and Max," A distinct, eclectic, charming and poignant animation.
","Mary and Max bring you into their world's with detail and character. The writing is inviting, sweet and very funny, but also allows for deep insight and raw poignancy. It truly is one of the best written animated films I of recent memory.Essentially Mary and Max is a film about detailed troubled people searching for friendship. It takes a refreshing stance on life that I have certainly not seen in other films before. The animation is beautifully characterive, and the soundtrack is stunning. But what I really like about Mary and Max is that it explores the lifelong questions of friendship, loneliness, anxiety and even suicide in a way that is as accessible to young teens as it is ground shaking for adults - it is rare that you find a film that is so honest and good natured..",9,1,3,26 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," A powerful and labyrinthine totem to humanity.
","Engaging in every sense of the word and on all spectrums - intellectually, emotionally, visually and imaginatively. Cloud Atlas is so thematically dense that it is surely an enigma that will and should be debated about for the foreseeable future. From a technical front, the original score is surely one of the greatest and finest compositions created solely for a film in the last 10 years, intrinsic to the film yet sweeping with awe-inducing grandeur - the re-envisioning of which only adds to the thematic accessibility and complexity of this epic tone poem of a film. The cinematography is stunning, saturated, and kinetic; distinct to each of the 6 sections without the shifts being jarring. The production design and costumes are intricate and lavish despite the need for each of the 6 different time-lines required their own different style.But it is not without fault, the tone shifts don't always work, the acting swings from Donna Bae incredible to Halle Berry poor, and the much talked about makeup is an odd hit-and-miss process. Cloud Atlas is likely a contender for the most divisive film since at least Moulin Rouge, also a barmy but dazzling experience, but not equal in my view - you simply have to be on for the ride or not, there is no in between. With all this said, it is still a great film, one of the best of the last 10 years even only for its sheer ambition, accessibility and thematic power; not to mention the visionary and surreal narrative techniques expanding the possibilities of cinema, or at least what is accepted (or not accepted) in cinema. To not be bowled over by this film you must be a cynic (or just a critic).",10,1,2,31 May 2014
The Thin Red Line," Terrence Malick's beautiful poetic meditation of war.
","The Thin Red Line is an artful and epic anti-war film that differs from others, highlighting not the evil from war, but the nature of war itself .The ensemble cast give powerful and contemplative performances throughout, making this one of the only war films to resonant emotionally. The cinematography and score is incredible, poignant and perfectly captures the dissonance of brutal, shaking war with the beauty and stillness of nature - which itself is the statement of the film. The score from Hans Zimmer is sweeping and graceful, exquisitely juxtaposing the bombastic scores we have come to expect. Roger Ebert said that The Thin Red Line was 'schizophrenic' as it seemed that the cast was driving for realism as the director was striving for transcendence; I actually believe that this ennobles the film and makes it so unlike and above the standard - surely one to rival Apocalypse Now.",10,14,20,26 May 2014
Gangs of New York," A well-paced, entertaining-enough historical blockbuster that lacks the narrative and thematic maturity set by other films.
","Martin Scorsese's grim and elaborate depiction of civil war New York. Gangs of New York sculpts an intriguing detailing of society and a compelling narrative driven around the evolving nature of Leonardo DiCaprio's Amsterdam Vallon and Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting relationship with each other. The huge, and I mean gigantic, ensemble cast are all consistently good enough to grant adequate immersion, even Cameron Diaz isn't terrible, and of course Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely flawless; every time he acts he creates one of the defining, most detailed and utterly memorable characters of its decade. The production is extensive and impressive in scope; featuring numerous detailed sets, countless costumes, and a seemingly infinite number of extras. It is in fact in Martin Scorsese's direction of Gangs of New York that the film falls from greatness, being amateurish at times even; the cinematography and score are unnoteworthy; the voice-over and flashbacks are expository and stops the film from transcending into narrative and thematic maturity (even with the adult content). But nevertheless, Gangs of New York is a well-paced, accessible, entertaining and even thrilling historical blockbuster, featuring a wonderfully indulgent production and a glorious and astoundingly good Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'The Butcher'.",7,0,0,26 May 2014
The Social Network," An ostensibly perfect but unaffecting biopic that is both timely and possibly immoral.
","David Fincher's completely 21st century biopic turned investigation into society turned crime thriller. Everything about The Social Network is seemingly, or at least, ostensibly perfect; Jesse Eisenberg is an astounding piece of casting, the acting is consistently believable, the direction and editing is solid bordering on great, the cinematography is grungy and dynamic, the score is tense, racing and sombre, the sound is precise, and the writing is witty, rapid and dense. Yet, even with all this, it is not enjoyable or even impactful. All the characters are frustrating; Mark Zuckerberg is self-entitled and pretentious, the Winklevoss twins are elitist and enviable, all women are played to be less capable than the men and completely objectified and Sean Parker is opportunistic and manipulative. Even Eduardo Saverin, the only character the audience is capable of rooting for, is incapable of seeing the forthcoming chaos. David Fincher possibly did this on purpose, but that makes The Social Network successful rather than enjoyable or wondrous - resulting in a film that is little more than a particularly well constructed drama. The overriding feeling when watching The Social Network is not wonderment, inspiration or awe, but instead resentment, anger and even jealousy. The society presented in The Social Network goes from an elitist and torturous fraternity, full of sexism and hierarchy, to a big-business talk filled silicon valley, to a cringe-worthy British rowing society, to a back-stabbing, hoody-wearing 'too cool for school' pretentious world-playing international corporation - all of which perfectly eloquate an America that stands for everything I find deplorable. Overall, if you are a member of the 'young hip' society portrayed, or at least don't find it immoral, then you should find that The Social Network is a near-perfectly constructed astute drama. But for me, I find the film merely respectable in craft, even if I physically hate watching it - few-to-no films have ever gotten under my skin and angered me so much. It's social pertinence and timely delivery has lead some to compare it wrongly to Citizen Kane, when truly the only similarity is in premise. As with Martin Scorsese, I find David Fincher to be more of a 'film-maker' than an artist, and The Social Network is no greater example of that perfect in craft, unaffecting in execution.",8,0,1,16 June 2014
