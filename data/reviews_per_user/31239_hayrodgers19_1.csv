Deja Vu," Wonderful Movie with a Great Ending
","This moving was not one I had been jumping to see, but after renting it I wish I could have seen it on the big screen. It is exciting and messes with your head just enough to make you think. Now, as a bit of a disclaimer if you like to analyze the possibility of the science in movies, you wont like it. The time travel methods are well explained, but I have no idea if they are really possible. But the plot is well thought, the actors are some of the best Hollywood has ever seen. As usual Denzel Washington steals the show, but even with that Jim Cavezal surprised and pleased me as a great 'villian'. Overall it is a great movie with fun twists and turns that holds on until the last moment!",10,1,2,4 May 2007
