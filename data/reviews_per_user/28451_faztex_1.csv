Resident Evil: Afterlife," Great fun for what it is, even in 2D
","Lots of action, Milla and Ali are as always most pleasing to watch. I admit the storyline may not be all that strong, and can be a bit ridiculous at times (such as at the start the way all Alice's clones are dealt with), but this is a movie about zombies, end of the world, mysterious bad company which somehow always has another base and resources available, but none of that matters here.The story flowed, included gore, (plenty of gore and plenty of entertaining gore), and I never felt it slowed down for long. I unfortunately have only seen this on the small screen, which was not even 3D. I imagine this is one movie that does benefit from 3D so will be looking to see it again when the chance arises.If you are looking for highly intellectual stuff, cunning twists and misdirection, this is not the film for you. If you're looking for action, stunning visuals, an escape, then this is great. While I enjoy movies that require focus to follow the story line and leave me thinking it over once done, I also enjoy movies which need nothing but to sit back and let it take you along for the journey, like a roller-coaster. That is how I watched this movie and the score I've given reflect how much I enjoyed the ride. I feel it holds very well with the first 3 Resident Evil movies, somehow the flavour seems consistent.This may not be the best movie of its genre but I don't feel I have to have watched the best to be satisfied. Besides, they don't all have Milla and Ali in there. For the more easy-going and non-critical of you out there I would recommend this piece of fun.",Null,2,3,22 July 2011
