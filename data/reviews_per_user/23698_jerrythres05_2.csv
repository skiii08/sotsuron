Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible : Failed to impress
","The few reason why this movie would be a hit is because it has Tom Cruise and Rhames, for the fact its released in the summer, and the publicity started from around March or February making it look like the best sequel ever. The movie is very disappointing. I have to admit there are a few action sequences and cool gadgets used in the movie. Other than that the story was not impressive and 70 - 80 percent of the scenes are predictable. The soundtrack (aka Background score) was horrible. They did not even use the proper theme from Limp Bizkit or Moby. Cruise has acting is impressive to some point. In the previous Mission Impossibles there was a cool fight scene in the end between the villain and Cruise, but in this one, the fight scene is very very disappointing. This movie contains few small comedy bits. I would rather watch the first Mission Impossible than to go to the theatres for this one. There must have been a lot of effort put into this movie, but there are soo many mistakes and some scenes don't concur with reality. There are a lot of mistakes in the scenes shot in Vatican City. I went to watch the movie with high hopes but came out disappointed. Most of the best scenes and shots of the movie are in the trailers.",5,3,9,6 May 2006
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," A SHAME FOR BOLLYWOOD or is it a coincidental hit
","This movies was one of the most predictable piece of work I have ever seen. There was absolutely nothing natural about this movie. From the first 10 minutes to the last everything happened as a coincidence and the actors keep saying it God's reason that they were together, given straight form the title RAB NE BANA DI JODI. Shah Rukh has given one of his worst performances ever. He over acted as Suri, the geek who worked for Punjab Power, and even worse while playing Raj, a cool hip guys that comes out of no where. Although the heroine in this movie, Anushka Sharma, did put a lot of effort into her debut role, but sad to say her character was not well built. I mean seriously, you wont recognize you husband if he took of his glasses and shaved his mustache? Where did she think she was going to end up with being friends with Raj? From the first time Raj and Taani met, he was flirting with her and kept talking about love and just kept overacting to be the coolest person in the planet. Everything happens coincidentally, from Day 1 of where Suri and Taani met, at her wedding, there just happened to be a bus accident where the whole family of the groom , and the groom himself, dies. Hearing this news her father has a heart attack, and then they are married shortly after all this tragedy. How realistic does this sound to you? Even a kid in Pre-school can figure out that there's something not right with this picture. I don't understand how some one can say this is a good movie in any way: the music including the background score was mediocre, the photography was below par, the art direction was bad, everything in the movie from the streets to the garage looked like a set, the only realistic looking location was the Golden Temple, the actor has give out a performance with the same crap he has been giving out for his past 100s of movie, and most importantly the dialogs and the story were absolutely ridiculous. With the movie rating to be below par in all these categories how can one say this was a great movie. We are in 2009, and Bollywood has been making the same kind of crap since the dawn of Indian cinema. One can argue with me by saying if this movie was crap why did it do so well in the Box Office. Well I have 3 letters for you SRK. People will spend money to see SRK's appearance on screen not matter how crappy the story or the director is. Well getting back to the movie, I gave this a 1 out of 10 because of its impracticality and the redundant storyline over the years of Bollywood cinema.",1,27,61,17 April 2009
