Skyfall," I was afraid...
","...very afraid that all the hype would be just that. From the opening scene in Turkey, to the wonderful theme song, sung and written by Adele, to the vulnerability of both Bond and M, (and the incredible acting by Daniel Craig and Judi Dench), to the many nods and references to past Bonds (which had me laughing aloud, or squealing like a giddy schoolgirl), to the deliciously creepy and insane villain played brilliantly by Xavier Bardem, this is probably going to end up being my favourite Bond film of all, and I have seen every one of them at least once.If you want OTT gadgets, exotic locations, and a parody of a 007, then go stick on a DVD of Moore or Brosnan and leave the good stuff to us who love the gritty realism.Oh, and I can't have been the only person of an age with Bond who was thinking exactly the same thing when he met Q - lol!",9,10,29,27 October 2012
Star Trek," Fan-bloomin'-tastic!
","***There are SPOILERS in this review***I have spent most of the afternoon trying to formulate a review that is a little calmer than how I felt when I left the cinema after seeing Star Trek... to say I left the theatre bouncing off the walls and with an inane grin should give you some clue as to how this film blew me away – it was FANTASTIC!I am 44 years old and grew up with these characters from the age of about 5 or 6, and let me tell you, the casting was top notch! Zachary Quinto as Spock was brilliant, Chris Pine as Kirk was brilliant, although I felt his character was a little too arrogant to start with, but by the end of the film I saw that he had to be cocky in order for his character to grow into the role, and boy, did he ever?! Simon Pegg as Scotty was hilariously brilliant – what a way to enter a star ship! LOL! But the stand out for me was Karl Urban as Leonard McCoy. He had his dry, sometime pithy sarcastic humour down to a T, and I was not watching someone playing the younger version of Bones – I was watching Bones himself.Another mention must go to Eric Bana who is fantastic and totally unrecognisable as the Romulan, Nero. Whatever you do, do not get into this film late, otherwise you will miss the awesome spectacle of his ship appearing on screen for the first time. It was also wonderful to see Leonard Nimoy as old Spock, and not just in a bit part, either. However, one thing that did bother me a little, I'm a child of the time/space continuum theory, and I didn't altogether agree with the two Spocks having a heart to heart, but that is a minor point.The opening scenes had me welling up and thankful that I had gone to see it alone – how embarrassing, crying at a film within the first 5 minutes, and a Star Trek movie at that! *rolleyes* The original series started in the 60's, and I loved how Earth, although is was in the future, was reminiscent of this era.To summarise, if you can only afford to see one film this summer, make sure it's this one.",7,4,12,7 May 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Two days on...
","... and I still have tears in my eyes. It is quite simply the most stunningly emotional, raw love story I have ever seen in my life, and probably ever will. My initial thought was how incredible Heath Ledger was in his role (and he was, completely), but the more I have thought about the film, the more I have come to appreciate Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as well, they complimented each other so well, and have my total admiration for giving it their all.Who would have thought that three little words, 'Jack, I swear...' could contain so much emotion, pain and despair, not just for Ennis, but for the viewer, too.I want to watch it again, but I'm not sure I have the emotional strength to. Heart wrenching.",10,15,17,5 September 2008
Juno," Serious social statement?
","Reading through some of the reviews here, I wonder if we watched the same movie. Some of you seemed to think it was trying to convey a serious social statement on teenage pregnancy - it wasn't! It was a gentle comedy with some great performances from all the cast, in particular J K Simmons, Allison Janney, but especially Michael Cera as Bleek. So Juno wasn't a typical teenager - what is a *typical* teenager? I was into 40's and 50's music when I was in my teens, so for a girl to be into the 70's scene and classic horror films is not so unusual.If you're reading the reviews to this film before watching it, don't be put off by all the negativity here - take it for what it is, a gentle, heart-warming comedy with some great performances.",7,1,6,9 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Better - phew!
","I went to see this film with some trepidation as the second one disappointed hugely, and although it was a bit confusing in parts, it brought the franchise back on form with a bang! I loved how the various characters were fleshed out, and the continuing explanatory dialogue between Pintell and Rageti was very funny. I thought the scene between Elizabeth and her father incredibly touching, as was the final scene at the end of the credits.*****SPOILER***** It is also the best marriage ceremony I have seen in any film to date! :D",8,3,4,5 June 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Good, but...
","I had high expectations of this film, and while it was good in parts, it was a jumbled, contrived mess with dubious morals in others. For example the hero, Patrick (Casey Affleck) kills a man in cold blood but because the man in question is a known paedophile with a dead boy in his bathroom, he is not arrested or questioned, and his girlfriend even tells him she is proud of him. But the biggest problem for me was the ending. Not only are we expected to believe that it was a conspiracy involving high ranking police officers, we are expected to swallow that Patrick truly believes that the child would be better off with her natural mother, when she clearly would not be. It could have been very good; it wasn't.",5,1,2,16 August 2009
Clash of the Titans," Not great but not THAT bad either
","I honestly do not know how people can compare this to the original 1981 film as if that were a classic - neither film is, and so the updated version should be taken for what it is: an enjoyable romp with monsters and mythical beings.Sam Worthington I felt was miscast as Perseus, Ralph Fiennes was great as Hades, Liam Neeson surprisingly disappointed as Zeus - for me he lacked gravitas, and he is one of my favourite actors of all time. But the man I could not take my eyes off was Mads Mikkelsen as Draco, who stole every scene he was in. Gemma Arterton was also great as Io.Some of the fight scenes were too quick and it was hard to follow the action at times, but all in all, if you want to leave your brain at the door and be entertained, this does a pretty good job of it.",6,0,1,26 April 2010
Toy Story 3," Brilliant, just brilliant!
","I thought Toy Story couldn't be topped, then they made number two, which is on an equal par to the original. When I heard that after a few years, they were going to make a third film, I was worried that it would be disappointing and nowhere near as good as the other two. I couldn't have been more wrong. It is not on a par, it is better, to the point of being on a different level altogether. It is already in mine, and my 22 year old son's list of top five all time favourite films, after just one viewing. Even if your children have grown up (like mine), you will still love this film as much as you had when they were young.",10,0,1,15 January 2011
RED," Fun, fun, fun!
","I can't believe that there are people who actually take this film seriously - it's obvious from the off that it's a parody of all the action flicks ever made, and such tremendous fun it is to watch, too. I love it when you can see the actors actually having a hard time keeping a straight face - they obviously enjoyed filming it as much as the audience enjoyed watching it. My one complaint is that Morgan Freeman was woefully underused, but John Malkovich totally stole the show - he tends to play crazy characters anyway, but Marvin was marvellous! And it was great to see Ernest Borgnine in a role - it was like a who's who of the Hollywood bible! I recommend Red for anyone who is in the mood for a laugh, coupled with some great, OTT action sequences.",Null,1,1,7 October 2011
