Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You'll laugh hysterically
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, is becoming one of the most talked about movies of the year. Borat, one of the three characters from Cohen's Da Ali G Show, is a completely naive and moronic character that Cohen plays with so much conviction that it's actually scary. One even wonders whether Cohen is a genius or a madman.Borat is directed by Larry Charles, whose previous efforts were the disappointing Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous, and several episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. All these projects had major creative input by their respective stars, Bob Dylan, and Larry David, as does his new film.Shot in a mockumentary-style, the film chronicles Kazakh reporter Borat and his overweight producer (Ken Davitian) in their adventures in the 'U.S. and A.' They are sent to create a documentary about our globalizing culture. However, Borat quickly falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on a rerun of Baywatch, and the plot ultimately turns into Borat's quest to California to marry Anderson. What's interesting is that Cohen, a Jew, is actually speaking a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish with a Polish accent in his subtitled mumblings. The film's plot is very weak. However, it's extremely doubtful that anyone in the audience would actually care, as they would be too busy laughing hysterically.Cohen finds humor in the reactions of everyday people in response to Borat's antics and candid inquiries. Cohen seems to never stop, as the movie is basically funny the whole way through. Cohen and Charles even accomplish the unthinkable in this film by creating sympathy for such a repulsive and clueless character. Completely broke, lonely and out of gas, Borat creates a fire for himself outside a building, and one actually feels sorry for him. Though Borat appears like such a despicable character, in reality, he is far too moronic to hate.Cohen might actually be making a statement concerning racism with this film, because beyond his tongue-in-cheek shtick, Borat unknowingly reveals what kinds of people are actually out there, the nice, along with the bigots and sexists.Even Borat himself proclaims he hates gays and Jews, but it becomes apparent that he has never even met either until his voyage into America. The bottom line is, no matter how stupid the plot is, and how politically incorrect it may be, this movie is completely hilarious all the way through.",7,0,6,18 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," Marie's gorgeous to behold
","Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette takes a vivid look into the lavish life of the controversial queen. Shot on location in Versailles, the film, along with The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation is stated to be part of a trilogy of the director's movies concerning women feeling alone.Plot has never been Coppola's strong suit, but should a minimalist approach work in a biopic? To an extent, it does. The film does not cover Marie Antoinette's entire life, but just the years she spent in Versailles. The film's main conflict resides in the necessity of Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst) to produce an heir with Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). This is a meager plot to sustain a two-hour long movie, but Marie Antoinette really isn't about the trials and tribulations of France and extraneous character arcs, but about Marie's own personal feelings of being an outsider while living in Versailles.The film successfully conveys her yearning for excitement beyond the confines of the royal court. Dunst gives an honest, respectable performance while Schwartzman gives a surprisingly excellent turn playing against type as the bloated, shy Louis XVI. However, the style and visual beauty of the film outweigh any of the performances. Costume designer, Milena Canonero, who has been producing magnificent work since the '70s in films such as Barry Lyndon and Chariots of Fire, creates a visual feast.Coppola's direction is spot on. Her style shines through with the usage of pink, blue tints and modern music. The music, including songs by New Order, The Cure, Bow Wow Wow and The Strokes, helps a historical film connect with a contemporary audience. By using modern music, one could actually feel the rush Marie felt when sneaking out to a masquerade party. Another device utilized by Coppola was having the actors speak in their own accents, instead of struggling to sound French or Austrian. Where Coppola missed the mark, however, was in the writing. Her decision to sidestep the ultimate fate of Marie Antoinette could have been a great idea, but the ending of the film felt abrupt and incomplete. Coming straight off an Oscar win for her brilliant previous script, Lost in Translation, Coppola's screenplay for Marie Antoinette is disappointing.Even without a perfect script, Coppola finds ways to create character and story without an utterance of dialogue. The simple switch of a portrait shows the death of a child, and the queen becomes aware of her fall in popularity when she applauds at an opera, but no one else joins in. Marie Antoinette had the possibility of being an outstanding film if it had been a reel shorter, but it was still a pleasure to watch.",7,2,4,6 November 2006
Hot Fuzz," Best comedy of 2007
","Edgar Wright, whose previous efforts include the beloved Shaun of the Dead, and the amazing Grindhouse trailer called Don't, manages to impress yet again in his latest film, Hot Fuzz. Also returning from Shaun of the Dead are Simon Pegg as co-writer and star and Nick Frost as the co-star in a loving, British homage to American action and buddy cop films. Nick Angel (Pegg) is the best police officer in London. Yet he's so great, that he makes everyone else (including his higher authorities) look inferior in comparison. He is then 'promoted' to work in the small town of Sandford, where the crime rate is miniscule but the 'accident' rate is soaring. As he realizes that the town is much more dangerous than it seems (intentional action cliché), he ends up befriending the Chief's son, Danny (Nick Frost), an inept police officer who wishes his life was more like the cops in Bad Boys II.For the most part, after British directors have a hit, they head straight off to Hollywood to make their next movie. However, after the cult success that was Shaun of the Dead, Wright stayed in England, and Hot Fuzz is as British a film as they come. The humor is truly more universal than anything like Monty Python or Alan Partridge, which some may love and others simply do not get.What makes Hot Fuzz so enjoyable is how much fun the filmmakers and actors are having on screen. Countless name drops and references to other movies are present, be it in the dialogue, the lighting or just a particular memorable shot. Action films that the main characters are shown viewing are intentionally spoofed later on in the film. In addition , there are dozens of references to movies that are presumably favorites of the writers. Young audiences might not catch such references to films like Chinatown, The Shining, and Lethal Weapon, and many more, yet the filmmakers implemented these allusions so that if these devices are unnoticed, the plot will not be affected.The amusing bit parts and cameos range from Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan, to Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett. Yet the man who reigns supreme over all of them is ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton, in more of a decently sized supporting role than a bit part. Dalton is the mustached Simon Skinner, an absurdly over the top villain who seems to be at the scene of every crime Pegg's character inspects.Hot Fuzz is a great film compared to recent 'parody films' like Epic Movie and to a lesser extent Scary Movie, because Hot Fuzz openly embraces the films it imitates, and the characters in the film play it completely straight, rather than acting as if they're in a comedy. Also, Wright actually has a strong visual and directorial style that accentuates the humor and over the top action. The opening of Hot Fuzz is a bit slow for some, but every single plot point covered from beginning of the film comes together in the erratic, explosive, ridiculously entertaining end.",10,4,8,30 April 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not bad
","Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique.",7,257,414,30 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," bad moments, and great moments
","Opening the 2007 summer movie season is Spider-Man 3, the ridiculously anticipated follow-up to its acclaimed 2002 and 2004 predecessors. What results is a film that finally shows the goofy, corny, yet extremely enjoyable style of director Sam Raimi. Still, the rumors are true, Spider-Man 3 does have too much going on, with about five different story lines tossed around. Raimi does a fairly competent job stringing them all together, but there isn't enough time to actually give some of the characters enough development. However, for all of the film's flaws, there are plenty of strengths.First of all, the film is extremely entertaining to watch, with its nearly two and a half hour running time breezing by. Toby Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, who struggles with issues involving his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Now becoming more of a threat to his life than a personal problem is Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his eagerness to avenge his father's death by donning the Green Goblin mask. Yet another storyline concerns a desolate criminal named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who may have been the actual killer of Peter's uncle. Spider-Man also scuffles with a rival photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) who eventually transforms into a creature known as Venom, and wrestles with his own impending dark side. With so much to keep track of in such a loaded film, characters like Venom and Flint Marko (The Sandman) don't receive enough screen time to really make an impact. Perhaps some story lines could have been saved for future films, in order to develop the more crucial characters. On the other hand, many segments are thoroughly cultivated, with Harry Osborn's relationship with Peter being one of the best handled elements of the film. One sequence of the film causing much polarity amongst audiences is when Spider-Man fully embraces his dark side and his new black spidey suit. Instead of Peter being ruthless and dark, Raimi makes him absurdly pompous. Rather than getting what was advertised as the darkest of the Spider-Man movies, we receive a very fun superhero film with great action sequences and many hysterical moments, including a cameo by the legendary Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead trilogy) as a French maitre'd. While definitely far from great, Spider-Man 3 has a notable distinction being that in spite of much of the clichéd dialogue and over the top moments, the film still succeeds in what it intends to do, which is to entertain. Raimi was certainly aware of what he was making, packing enough action, comedy, and strong performances to obscure the cringe inducing moments.",8,2,4,7 May 2007
Zodiac," 10/10
","Director David Fincher finally ends his five year hiatus with a new masterwork in his take on the Zodiac murder case. In Zodiac, Fincher still clings to his dark, thrilling roots, yet expands his horizons in presenting the majority of the film from the perspective of a newspaper room. Unlike his previous notable works, (Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room) Fincher is not trying to be overly flaunting with the camera. Instead, he focuses on the details. From the opening vintage Universal and Warner Brothers logos to the pens Jake Gyllenhaal's character uses, we are completely thrown into the '60s-'70s time period that Zodiac predominantly encompasses.Zodiac's main theme seems to be precision. The camera is always in the right place and the performances by every actor is pitch perfect, without anyone being overly showy. There are a few artistic moments where Fincher departs from subtlety and awes us, such as showing a time lapse sequence of the creation of the Transamerica Tower. It's safe to say that Zodiac is the best looking film shot with digital technology thus far . The film is shot on the same High Definition camera as Collateral and Miami Vice, and unlike those films, the look is not unsettling or distracting at all.The film's meticulous obsession with detail also mirrors the characters and the story of the film itself. Throughout the film, we are introduced to four major characters who become obsessed with the Zodiac killer, one of whom ends up devoting all of his time to the case, neglecting his family in the process and potentially risking his life to identify the murderer. This character, Robert Graysmith, the writer of the book the film is based on, is played neurotically by Gyllenhaal. Robert Downey Jr. shows that he's still one of Hollywood's top actors in his dry, witty, self-destructive portrayal of reporter Paul Avery. Anthony Edwards plays William Armstrong, a detective partnered to Mark Ruffalo's David Toschi. Ruffalo fearlessly changed his voice and mannerisms to play Toschi, surprising many who have only seen him in romantic comedies.One complaint about Zodiac is that the film is too long. Yes, it is long, but it isn't boring at all. Every scene is packed with so much information and detail that it isn't surprising to hear that a previous cut of the film ran a half an hour longer. Some scenes are expository and somewhat slow, but these are necessary in order for the faster, edgier scenes to shine. The film's length is necessary to introduce the vast ensemble of characters, with performances by Brian Cox, Chloe Sevigny, and John Carroll Lynch being the most memorable. What is also remarkable is the epic feel of the film that trailers failed to show. We ultimately span from the late sixties to the mid eighties, as well as an additional scene in the nineties, closing out with an contemporary epilogue over Donovan's ominous Hurdy Gurdy Man.In Zodiac, Fincher did what so few have done. Under the cramped confines of a major studio, he ambitiously created a film both artistically satisfying and utterly entertaining.",10,2,7,4 March 2007
Disturbia," Solid and Entertaining
","Disturbia star Shia LaBeouf appears to have a great future ahead of him. In the past few years, amidst forgettable roles in I, Robot, and Constantine, he contributed strong performances in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and now in the thriller Disturbia. Although it is basically a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, Disturbia is unique in that it mixes elements of teen comedy, romance, drama, and gripping suspense in an entertaining way. Not to say the film is perfect, as it definitely isn't, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and then some. All of the acting is decent and believable, with standout performances by the aforementioned LaBeouf as Kale, and David Morse, as the suspected villain, Mr. Turner. Serving as great comic relief is Kale's friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) while the new girl next door, Ashley (Sarah Roemer), provides a romantic interest. Also notable is The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss as Kale's mother who is great as always, yet underused.Kale gets put on house arrest after punching his Spanish teacher in class. It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier. Under house arrest, he begins to learn the secrets of everyone surrounding him through the use of binoculars and video cameras. His most important realization in his voyeurism is that his somewhat reclusive neighbor shares many suspicious similarities to a wanted serial killer whom the police have not yet identified.It's generally difficult to create such suspense under the restrictions of a PG-13 rating (do not watch this at the theater between 7-9 PM to avoid the loud middle school crowd), but instead of just trying to shock, the film conveys paranoia and fright through the use of mood and mere suggestions of menace. The script could have used another rewrite to further develop the cast of characters, as the only one who is fleshed out at all is LaBeouf's. LaBeouf, who turns twenty-one in June, is looking to join Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Gosling as one of the few great actors under the age of thirty if he keeps turning in strong performances in interesting projects. His star is certainly rising with Transformers due this summer and the fourth Indiana Jones film in the summer of 2008. We have to realize that even though there is so much that makes Disturbia unique, at heart it is a very commercial effort. The twists are quite obvious, many characters are underdeveloped, and there's product placement everywhere (which is realistic nonetheless). However, at a brisk 104 minutes, it would be a lie to say the movie wasn't extremely satisfying, and an undeniably entertaining film.",8,142,201,16 April 2007
Children of Men," Excellent
","Children of Men, loosely based on the novel 'The Children of Men' by P.D. James, combines an intense depiction of a dystopian future with an avant-garde visual style. The director, Alfonso Caurón, who helmed such diverse films such as Great Expectations, Y Tu Mama Tambien, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, shows yet again that he can tackle any genre.The film stars Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City) as Theo, a bureaucrat in 2027 London., who has refrained from human contact with everyone except for his hippy friend named Jasper, played by Michael Caine. We enter the film with news of the youngest person on earth dying, who is a little more than eighteen years old. It is understood that women are now infertile, but the reason for this disturbing phenomenon is not really explained. The characters in the film don't know either, creating the prevalent chaos. The plot gets moving when it is discovered that a young refugee, Kee is pregnant, and she needs Theo's help to get her to a group of scientists called The Human Project, in order to keep her baby safe.Overpowering this compelling story is the amazingly impressive technical achievement, aided by Caurón's long time director of photography, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the art direction team. Like Cauron's Y Tu Mama Tambien, Children of Men is shot almost entirely in hand-held, a technique movie-goers have a love it or hate it attitude towards. Caurón and Lubezki manage to pull off entire scenes in what appears to be a single shot, as well as a battle scene that runs over seven minutes long. This scene contains realistically decayed, massive buildings, as well as flawless staging of actors and extras. The result is that rather than looking like science fiction, the film feels as if it was shot on an actual warfront in the future with a hand-held camera.It's astonishing that a film so interested in its technical merits really held its own acting-wise. Clive Owen is wonderfully dry, yet caring as the cynical Theo, and Caine is at perfection in a surprisingly comical, scene stealing role unlike we've ever seen him before. Yet it is Caurón that reveals himself as the real star of the film, with a virtuoso directing effort.Children of Men will definitely find some viewers who feel it is simply incredible, as well as many detractors, consisting of those who feel the film left too many questions unanswered, especially with its abrupt ending. However, most will appreciate the flawless technical accomplishments (apart from a fake looking CGI baby) of the film regardless of ones opinion about how fulfilling the story was. Nevertheless, Children of Men is a gritty, compelling, and occasionally funny film that is imperative for any serious movie-goer to see.",9,2,5,10 January 2007
The Fountain," hmm
","It's been six years since acclaimed writer-director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) released his last film. Those six years have been a whirlwind of youthful ambition and overwhelming disappointment. The Fountain's early incarnation in 2002 was a big budget epic starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, then after Pitt dropped out for 'creative differences', Aronofsky had to start over, creating what he calls the no budget version of his early script. Pitt was replaced with Hugh Jackman, and Blanchett was replaced with his fiancé Rachel Weisz. The end result is an intimate love story, that just so happens to span three different time periods.Fans of Aronofsky's previous work will be surprised by his latest film. Gone are the hip hop montages, Snorricam shots (a camera attached to the actor), and nauseating visual tricks. However, Aronofsky keeps his trademark center framing, fades to whites, and ambiguous endings. This is Aronofsky's most original, artistic, and ambitious work to date, and every single shot appears to be profusely thought out. It can even be said this is a thirty-five million dollar art film.All audiences can appreciate The Fountain's remarkably original photography and astonishing visual effects, guided by Aronofsky's long time cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, as well as the gorgeous score by Clint Mansell, also a previous Aronofsky collaborator. However, will audiences be able to appreciate the film itself? Viewer's reactions from the film have ranged from 'beautiful,' 'gripping,' and 'transcendent' to 'muddled,' 'unfocused,' and even 'pretentious.' This polarizing effect might have something to do with the odd, interweaving structure of the three time periods the film covers: past, present, and the future in space. In addition, Hugh Jackman plays the same character throughout each time period, which can further confuse audiences.Darren Aronofsky stated in an interview on Joblo.com that before a prescreening of his film, he told the audience: 'Don't think too much.' Also, Jackman and Weisz have claimed numerous times that although the film might seem confusing, it's really just a love story at heart. If a viewer takes this advice before watching The Fountain, the film will make perfect sense, and the viewer can appreciate how much Aronofsky did with such a simple idea.Essentially, The Fountain is about a man, Tom (undoubtedly a reference to David Bowie's Major Tom songs) trying to save his wife, Izzy, who is dying from brain cancer. Tom can't come to terms with her death, yet Izzy openly awaits it. Hugh Jackman is at his undisputed finest as Tom, showing a complete range of emotions, while the beautiful Rachel Weisz gives another solid performance as Izzy, even though it is Jackman, who undoubtedly carries the film. Other critics have proclaimed that Tom and Izzy have little to no character development, but the story Aronofsky is trying to tell is so simple and organic that the characters themselves are just symbols for Man and Woman.The Fountain is a staggeringly ambitious film that does contain some ridiculous moments and a slow start, but nevertheless, the story of a man's quest for immortality is something we can all relate to.",5,1,3,26 November 2006
The Departed," Four Stars
","Jack Nicholson is widely known for playing characters like himself. The question for the audience of his latest film, The Departed, is, will you be watching his character or the grinning Nicholson we know and love? Veteran Director Martin Scorsese opens the film in a way that any speculation of whether Nicholson can pull off his nastiest role to date (his turn as The Joker in Batman comes close) vanishes on the spot. Scorsese shows Nicholson in shadows during the opening sequence, aided by The Rolling Stone's Gimme Shelter. Not until the audience has been truly sold that this is the brutal, malevolent, and immoral Frank Costello, does Nicholson's face reveal itself from under the shadows.The Departed, based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, carries some large star power. The director, Scorsese, is arguably one of the best working directors to date. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, the aforementioned Nicholson as Frank Costello, with supporting roles by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone. Catch any wind of that list of names and any expectations of this film go sky high. Yet despite gargantuan expectations for a film that was rumored to have so much tension on its set, the movie succeeds on almost every level.First off, the screenplay by William Monohan is brilliant. The fast, often surprisingly hilarious dialogue is coupled with the gripping story of two informers, one infiltrating the Boston State Police (Damon) and the other the Irish Mafia (DiCaprio). Scorsese's stylistic direction and old film school techniques assisted by Michael Ballhaus's slick cinematography make the story flow smoothly yet surprisingly fast-paced for a two and a half hour movie.The acting is phenomenal all around. DiCaprio proves his skill to everyone who denied his talent, even after his award worthy role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (his second pairing with Scorsese, the first being Gangs of New York). He truly gives a layered, emotional performance, and arguably his best. Matt Damon reminds us that he is still an extremely capable actor, yet his role feels overshadowed by DiCaprio's. Nicholson gives one of his best performances with his wild turn as Frank Costello. However, the very underrated Mark Wahlberg gives a scene stealing performance as Dignam, giving his best work to date. Just about every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely hilarious. Sheen also gives a surprisingly great supporting performance, as do Farmiga and Baldwin.The film is nearly perfect until a scene during its climax, where the action might appear over the top to some. But not to worry, the film's ultimate ending provides all the satisfaction one could hope for. The Departed is a remarkable film, proving that Martin Scorsese still has it after all these years, churning out what is possibly the best movie of the year.",10,2,4,18 November 2006
Psycho," Works because of the performances
","Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a clichÃ© in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and 'skeletons.'",7,2,4,29 October 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Last King a riveting look at despotic demon
","Whether playing a tough high school football player in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, legendary jazz musician Charlie Parker in Bird or a mafia hit-man in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Forest Whitaker has always given solid, occasionally great performances.Yet, only with his role in The Last King of Scotland will Whitaker finally receive the respect he deserves. In his first non-documentary feature, director Kevin Macdonald gives a highly ambitious look at Ugandan dictator Idi Amin (Whitaker) through the eyes of Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy) in the 1970s.Macdonald definitely shows his documentary roots through the use of extensive location shooting in Uganda, giving a guerrilla, authentic approach to the film. He also uses a fair amount of hand-held camera-work, grain and noticeable zooms to give this political thriller a documentary feel. The cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, utilizes high-contrast, deeply saturated images of Uganda with a prevalent light brown hue.The pacing is fast, and the style, technique, costumes and music accurately illustrate the '70s feel. When we first meet Idi Amin, he's portrayed as a humorous but intense politician who has just become Uganda's president.However, by the end of the film, the humor is gone. We finally get to see Amin's true colors.Whitaker brilliantly captures the intensity and brutality of Amin, while maintaining his charismatic qualities. He is so convincing, that the footage of the real Idi Amin, spliced into the end of the film, completely flows.The screenplay, written by Jeremy Brock, Peter Morgan, and Joe Penhall, based on the novel by Giles Foden, actually focuses more on the naive Dr. Garrigan than on Amin. Garrigan would be too unlikable to care about in any other film, with his arrogance, selfishness, and ignorance. His naiveté seems appealing at first, then idiotic, and eventually completely loathsome. But what saves his character flaws is the on screen chemistry between him and Whitaker, and a strong performance by McAvoy. However, what is entirely misleading is the statement 'This film is inspired by true events,' as the McAvoy character is fictional.The last half hour of the film ultimately becomes a thriller, coupled with a few scenes of absolute horror. Audiences will cringe in disgust at the violence attributed to Amin, who reportedly killed more than 300,000 Ugandans, while staying on the edge of their seats when not covering their eyes in terror.The suspenseful final scene at the Entebbe airport provides a painful, though emotionally satisfying ending to a heavy handed film.The Last King of Scotland is an extremely powerful film, with a commanding performance by Whitaker.",8,1,2,22 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," 8 out of 10
","Stranger Than Fiction has had endless comparisons to the films written by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), while the performance of the film's lead actor, Will Ferrell, has been compared to the dramatic turns of comedic actors, such as Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, and Robin Williams. While Stranger Than Fiction is definitely more mainstream than a film written by Charlie Kaufman, comparisons of Will Ferrell's performance to Jim Carrey in The Truman Show do have merit. Will Ferrell successfully gives a dramatic performance in this comedic film.Director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) reinvents his directing style by creating a film that is very reliant on its screenplay. He refrains from an overly visual look by composing a flat, minimally toned image, and carefully directs Ferrell to a performance where not once does he overact. The screenplay, written by Zach Helm, apparently was much buzzed about when it was initially pitched. It sparked a bidding war throughout many studios and was eventually won by Sony Pictures. Helm's first produced script provides an extremely creative premise, but in parts, seems like the characters were too self aware of the direction of the storyline.Will Ferrell gives his best performance to date as the IRS agent Harold Crick, and Emma Thompson is equally great as the writer's block suffering author Karen Eiffel. Crick starts to hear Eiffel's voice narrating his actions, and we come to realize that Crick is the main character of Eiffel's new book. Out of desperation, Crick seeks out literary professor Jules Hilbert, quirkily played by Dustin Hoffman, for guidance on where his own narrative is going. Hoffman's performance is reminiscent to his role in 2004's similarly toned, I Heart Huckabees. Maggie Gyllenhaal is also great as Ana Pascal, a tattooed baker who refuses to pay her taxes, while Queen Latifah reminds us that she's still funny as the underdeveloped character of Eiffel's assistant..The film weaves comedy, romance, and fantasy all together in a similar fashion to Adaptation. Also like in Adaptation, the character of the author will create an ending that parallels the ending of the actual movie. Stranger Than Fiction's ending is incredibly fascinating, and will be either loved or hated. While others might see the ending as an unsatisfying copout, it is a truly complex conclusion that gives the audience closure on whether the film is a comedy or a tragedy. Stranger Than Fiction is not your typical Will Ferrell comedy. It isn't loud, and it doesn't contain Ferrell running around nude. However, it is an intelligent, clever film, that has its moments of contempt, fantasy, and romance.",8,0,1,18 November 2006
Casino Royale," A Bond for a new generation
","After a series of campy films and a four-year hiatus, James Bond is back. In Casino Royale, the 21st official Bond film, Daniel Craig steps up as the sixth Bond, giving the best portrayal of 007 to date. Craig makes the role his own. His believable interpretation is gritty, down to earth, and vulnerable, while maintaining Bond's classic sharp wit and arrogance.After a black-and-white introduction where Bond earns his first two kills and reaches double-0 status, the classic gun barrel opening sequence begins, and the audience is sold. However, this Bond is neither suave nor polished. He does not wink, and when he fights, he bleeds. He is young, raw, quick and muscular.Casino Royale was the first Bond book written by Ian Fleming. However, the film is not a prequel, like Batman Begins. It's set in contemporary times, and is not meant to connect with the previous 20 films. During the suspenseful casino sequences, the popular Texas Hold 'Em is played instead of the novel's baccarat.Director Martin Campbell, who also helmed GoldenEye, arguably the best Bond film starring Pierce Brosnan, proves his talent of inspiring strong performances, even without a distinctive style. The screenplay credit is given to three individuals: Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and Paul Haggis.Wade and Purvis co-wrote the last two Bond scripts, which were quite inferior in comparison to Casino Royale's wonderful script. Therefore, it's safe to say that the talents of Oscar-winner Haggis added the right element.Eva Green is unlike any other Bond girl. She doesn't dress elegantly unless she has to. She doesn't show any inclination to seduce Bond. She even displays a layered personality. And he actually gets to know her. Also in the cast is Judi Dench, reprising her role as M, and Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, a very peculiar bond villain who has a dead eye that weeps blood.The only complaint one could have for Casino Royale is the length. After a fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of a movie, the films film's conclusion feels bloated, and will confuse most viewers.Nonetheless, Casino Royale should maintain Bond's old audience, and grasp a new one. The film is exactly the fresh start that the James Bond franchise needed. It shows us Bond's early mistakes and immaturity, so as the series goes on we'll understand how and why he becomes the wise, suave, womanizing and deadly Bond we all know.",9,1,3,24 November 2006
