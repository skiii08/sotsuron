The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Nice,but expected more
","Honestly I'm not a fan of hunger games,i have never read any of the books,but i really really liked catching fire,and i was expecting a lot from the sequel and wanted to know what happened and all that,but the movie was so slow paced and there was a lot of violence unnecessarily,and a lot of parts bored me.I was disappointed that there wasn't any games in this film,but still i liked it because of a few things:Jennifer Lawrence's acting,some things were new in the hunger game series,some parts were funny,and emotional.These things make it watchable.I liked the movie,but not as much as catching fire.Seriously it could have been much much better,i hope part 2 would be better than this.For those who haven't watch this movie,don't watch it if you are bored,don't watch it after working,and when you are tired.Watch it only if you like Jennifer Lawrence,or if you are a fan of hunger games.",6,14,32,8 December 2014
Interstellar," This is the type of movie i have been waiting for
","I had always wanted a movie about going out of the solar system to see whats out there,but i have never seen a movie with that kind of story.And here comes Interstellar.Exactly what i wanted to see.Going far away,visiting other planets out of the solar system.Perfect space movie,beautiful story about a beautiful relationship of father and daughter,with mind blowing images of space and the other planets.It just feels so nice when watching it.Some parts are confusing,and i cant seem to understand some words they say and the actions they do.But i really loved how the film shows space and planets,and I'm amazed with the climax scene.How does someone think like that?Its just so amazing,i didn't even realize 3 hours had passed.Plus this movie is much more realistic than other space movies,and it makes the viewing experience more enjoyable.Interstellar is worth a watch,everyone should watch it.",8,1,5,8 December 2014
