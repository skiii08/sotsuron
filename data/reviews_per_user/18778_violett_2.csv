Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Huge let down
","Unfortunately, I was extremely excited to see this movie.  I love the first 3 movies so I was really anticipating the coming of this one.  What a let down.  I thought I was going to see a Star Wars movie not a Muppet movie!If the others are like this I feel that Mr. Lucas will ruin his great reputation.",1,12,23,19 June 1999
The Matrix," Speechless...
",This movie is the best I've seen since Star Trek: Insurrection.  I actually had no desire to see it but went anyway.  I was shocked at the stunning special effects that were put into this movie.  Definitely an award winner! I was left speechless afterwards.  There wasn't one thing I didn't like about the movie.  Even the soundtrack is the best I've ever owned.  As of now it's my all time favorite (the movie and the CD).  It'll take A LOT to move this movie out of the #1 spot in my top 10 list!,10,0,0,2 May 1999
