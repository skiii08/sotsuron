Scarface," Sosa is just awesome
",One of the best things about this film is the care that has been taken to build the secondary characters. This is especially true of the Bolivian drug overlord Alejandro Sosa (the great Paul Shenar). This aristocratic gentleman is one of the most incredible characters I have ever seen. The contrast between the horrific activity he is involved with and the class of his manners is fantastic. This duality is summarized in a memorable quote (a true gem): 'Alberto is an expert in the disposal business'. Have you ever heard of a more refined way to name to a murderer?,9,0,0,19 January 2001
