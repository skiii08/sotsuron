Sucker Punch," Confused about the plot of Zack Snyder's masterpiece Sucker Punch? Read this theory which will answer all the questions you lay have about this movie.
","When you have read other reviews like I have, you will have noticed that a few theories are very widely spread. One is about the dancing sequences of Babydoll being her escape from being raped. The other one is of Sweet Pea being the lead character and it's all her imagination we see and not Babydoll's. I will try and explain why these two theories are wrong.The imaginative part of the movie starts and ends with the doctor hammering the lobotomy tool through Babydoll's brain. This is the first and most direct evidence of it all actually being Babydoll's imagination and no one else's. The other, more confusing evidence for this is the wise man/bus driver. This has a lot of people confused. The fact that we see the wise man appear as the bus driver can be explained as follows: When Babydoll and Sweet Pea escaped the asylum we think we see the real world events, not the fantasy. Yet, they are still wearing their brothel outfits. So this must still be the fantasy part. The switch between real life and the fantasy world in this part of the movie is why we get thrown off. Rewatch these scenes to understand what I'm talking about. In the extended version of the movie, we can see Sweet Pea taking down a dress from someones clothing line. It is this dress she wares at the bus station in the movies final scene. In the final shot of the movie we can see a billboard that has 'Paradise Diner' written on it. Remember Sweet Pea telling Babydoll to 'write her a postcard from Paradise'? This is yet another hint to the fact that we are actually seeing Babydoll's fantasy of Sweet Peas escape. Babydoll is taken away by the security guards just as Sweet Pea passes the main gate of the asylum. What happens after that is not known by Babydoll. Unfortunately, Dr. Grovsky fails to mention what happened too. She mentions that Babydoll helps Sweet Pea escape, but she doesn't say if she stayed out of the hands of the guards. She may have been caught later on. We don't know.Now for the dancing sequences. It is being made very clear in the complete story that the only time that girls are being assaulted (if at all) is after they have been lobotomized. Since these are Babydoll's fantasies from before her lobotomizing, we can assume that she is not being raped by that fact alone. Not by Blue anyway. The only scene where she may have been assaulted is when she dances for the cook. I believe what happened in the real world at that time is that the cook (being defeated earlier by Babydoll when she rescues Rocket from him) now tries to rape Babydoll. The cook once again fails in his attempts, because Rocket, returning the favor, rescues Babydoll from the hands of the cook. They other dancing sequences may be group sessions, led by Dr. Grovsky. They are generally not something she is suppressing even in her fantasy substitute of the occurrences at the asylum. They are merely a transfer to the second level of fantasy. Whenever she dances, one of the other girls is stealing one of the required items. Anothert hing we have to remember is that it is being made very clear that her virginity is being saved by Blue for the High Roller. And in the brothel's final scenes Babydoll says to Blue, right after stabbing him in the left shoulder that 'he will never have her, EVER'. This statement directly implies that he has also never had her before that time.",Null,2,3,10 September 2011
Deadpool," Painfully awful
","The highly anticipated Deadpool movie is finally here and everyone seems to want to be amongst the first people to see it. If the number of people who went to see a movie was any indication of how good it is, Deadpool would be awesome. Unfortunately, most of the times those number only indicate how well a product was advertised and Deadpool may be an example of just that.Because it is certainly not a very good movie and it certainly doesn't live up to it's expectations. Instead, Deadpool is basically 108 minutes of toilet humour mixed with not particularly well choreographed fighting scenes and an occasional breaking the 4th wall.Maybe most disappointing are these 4th wall breakings. Nowhere does the movie make clear that the titular character is effectively aware of the fact that he's a movie character, which would be the case for a movie adaptation of a comicbook character who is 'comic aware'. Throughout the movie it merely feels like the lead character is just narrating the story about himself, rather than a movie about a character that is aware of the fact that he is a movie character. Even the mandatory Stan Lee cameo wasn't used and the wisecracking (allthough at times funny, particularly the joke about the lack of superhero's at the X- mansion) at the camera nowhere surpasses Ferris Bueller.Deadpool could have been an awesome movie and a completely different kind of superhero movie. The trailer had us expacting no less, but instead it even falls short to that other superhero movie Ryan Reynolds starred in. That movie never got a green light for a sequel. If it were up to me Deadpool would also receive a red light.",4,38,87,18 February 2016
