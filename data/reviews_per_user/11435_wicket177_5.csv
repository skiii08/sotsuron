Alien 3," Ummmm... It sucked
","Alien was such a good movie... Aliens ALMOST topped it... but this?  What is this movie?  Where is the suspense?  The terror?  The awesome feeling you get from watching Alien for the first time?  It seems to me like this movie was targeted at 14 year olds (or immature adults for that matter) who like to see blood and people getting hacked up.  The beginning alone was awful. Everybody died!  Producer: 'Hmm... since nobody wanted to remake a classic and they all hated the script, they refused to be in it... well, lets just MURDER THEM ALL AT THE BEGINNING'Anyways... This is a sad movie... and Alien Resurrection isn't a whole lot better.  The only value that this movie has is if you have a girlfriend who doesnt like blood... maybe she'll get closer to you... eh, but then she would break up with you cause you showed her such a stupid movie... what am I talking about... Dont see it, thats all.***3 stars***",5,398,418,4 March 2002
Snatch," Hilarious and smart
","Entertainment weekly gave this movie an awful review.  Why?  I dunno... oh well, I thought it was great.  It's so funny and almost as good as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Benicio is the man and everybody else did awesome too (even Brad Pitt!).  The music is great and fits perfectly with the movie.  HA the milk part is the best... Guy Richie is awesome... but... who would marry Madonna?********8********",8,0,1,4 March 2002
Mulholland Drive," A little help.
","SPOILERSSomebody commented here that nobody is supposed to understand this movie.  It's just David Lynch's weird mind and it'snot supposed to make any sense.  That's bull.  This movie has avery particular (and very very good) story line that is 100%understandable if you can do one thing; you have to understandthe sequence of events that Lynch twisted around so much.  Forthe convenience of everyone reading this (and anyone dying tounderstand this movie) I have set up the sequence of events as Iunderstand them.  Watch the movie again, and pay attention to the10 keys that Lynch provides.  Print this out if you need to : )Sequence of Events in Mulholland Dr. (according to wicket_saic@hotmail.com)  1.  Diane wins the Jitterbug contest.  Her family (the old man andold woman) is there and cheers for her.  (this is much earlier thanany of the rest of the movie.  years possibly)  2.  Camilla and Diane fool around on the couch (notice theashtray).  Camilla says that they shouldn't do that anymore.  3.  Camilla and the director talk and kiss in the car for the movie. 4.  Diane gets a phone call and is told to get in the limo.  She isdropped of at the bottom of the directors house.  The dinner sceneoccurs in which she finds out that her lover Camilla and thedirector are getting married.  5.  Diane sits in a restaurant with the hit-man and tells him to killCamilla.  6.  Diane returns home and feels guilty.  7.  She falls asleep on the pillow.   8.  Diane has a long dream.  What happens in this dream iscoming from guilt and the people surrounding her life.  Thedirector who is getting married to her x-lover has a terrible life.  Herx-lover loves her again.  Diane is an amazing actress and does agreat job.  The part with the men in the restaurant and the monsteris all just a part of the dream.  The cowboy has nothing to do withthe movie for the most part.  He was just seen by Diane at onepoint and he stuck with her so he's in her dream.  Her dead auntshows up.  She mixes up names just like everybody often does indreams.  None of this is real.  There are many things her dreamfeeds off of... to many things to try to explain.  The dream beginswith Camilla (Rita) in the car and ends with the cowboy waking herup.  That is all within her dream.  9.  A knocking wakes Diane up.  It is her neighbor looking for therest of her belongings.  She picks up her ashtray (notice the bluekey) and says that there are detectives looking for Diane.10.  While making coffee, Diane thinks she sees Camilla (whoshe just had killed).  Its just a daydream.11.  Diane goes and sits on the couch and stares at the blue key. Someone is knocking (I think that this could be the detectiveslooking for Diane).  The little people are her family representingher conscience.  She gets scarred of the knocking and thehaunting visions of her loved ones and she runs into her roomand shoots herself.THE ENDThis is the order in which the movie plays out.  See why it's soconfusing?1, 7, credits, 8, 9, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 end creditsHope this helps everyone and please stop saying that this moviehas no point and its just a bunch of thrown together scenes.  It hasa very definitive purpose and meaning.  You just have to do somethinking to figure it all out.  ********* 9 stars *********",10,29,40,7 September 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," One of my few 10s
","may contain some spoilersI saw this movie when I was 16 and I loved it.  It still amazes me how good acting can get... There are very few movies where there are two actors this good.  Anthony Hopkins is absolutely fabulous as Hannibal Lecter and Jodi Foster is perfect for her role as Starling.  The way they interact is so bitter-sweet it's incredible.  However, as good as the acting is, the feeling of their scenes together could not be achieved without the wonderful cinematography.  When Lecter touches Clarices' hand when he gives her the notes back is almost emotional.  That is the only time they make physical contact in the movie, yet it feels like they've loved each other forever. The pervertedness and gore is used very well.  I am so glad that Silence of the Lambs didn't turn into some kind of a Scream slasher and it remained a true suspense thriller until the very end.Oh, and Senator, just one more thing: love your suit!**********10 stars**********",9,0,0,5 March 2002
Signs," A story about faith, not aliens.
","Contrary to many beliefs about this film, I truly feel that it is a filmabout faith with a surrounding of an alien invasion; not a film aboutan alien invasion with faith thrown in.  Signs is an extremly wellwritten story and very wonderfully shot.   M. Night Shyamalan is notthe most amazing director, but he is by far the most amazing storyteller of our time.  Watching one of his movies is like listening toyour grandmother slowly reading a bedtime fairy-tale to you andletting your imagination run away with the concepts.  It mightsound corny, but it's true.  None of his films are big on gloriousspecial effects or awesome action sequences... they are all basedupon a genuine flow of story.  The ambiance Shyamalan createsis so perfectly eerie that it reinforces my strong belief that its whatyou DONT see that's scary.  Also, I think that the young actresswho played Bo stole the show... I have no idea where they foundsuch a perfect little girl for the part, but she did amazing comparedto other child actors in movies today.  Joaquin Phoenix also did anoutstanding job and almost made Gibson look like an amature(almost...).POTENTIAL SPOILER: The best and most frightening part for mewas the birthday party on the news... VERY well done...
