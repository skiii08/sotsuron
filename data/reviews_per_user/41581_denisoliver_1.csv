Requiem for a Dream," Incredible.
","Absolutely stunning. Nothing compares. And Ellen Burstyns acting is one of the most impressive and touching i ever saw in a movie.In the beginning i expected it to be close to e.g. 'Trainspotting' or some Guy Ritchie films, but soon it turns out to be a nightmarish spiral of sadness, grief and personal surrender.A breathtaking must.",10,0,1,30 January 2004
