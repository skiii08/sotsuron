The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype!!!!
","I went with some friends to go see the Blair Witch Project on Sunday and my hopes of a scary thriller were set high. The online and just the all around buzz was good and it seemed like everyone was talking about it. I didn't know anyone who saw it because of the limited release of the film. Some friends who went to see it before were turned away due to sold out shows. When the movie started you are introduced to the characters as they pack for their trip. Right away I will warn you that this WHOLE movie is filmed with an 8mm camera and even if you don't get motion sickness you just might start when you watch this documentary. There was never a scary moment and there was only a scene or two that even hinted at suspense. I would recommend waiting for this to come out on video, but if you must see it then bring some Dramamene and be prepared to look away from the screen several times before you get nauseous from watching the camera bounce around the whole time. The only thing that scared my friends and I was the thought of throwing up in the theater from being so dizzy and light headed. I can't see how anyone could say this was scary. To even compare this to The Exorcist is idiotic. I have seen Twilight Zone episodes that were scarier than this. Please don't believe the faulse hype that was buzzed by the actual film makers of this movie.",4,0,2,26 July 1999
