Despicable Me 2," Good animated fun!
","I went to see this film this morning and found it very enjoyable. I can't really remember the 1st so I can't really compare. Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, funny, feel good film that keeps you entertained from the 1st minute to the last. The pace of the film moves along nicely and keeps the audience attention very well. It has many laugh out loud moments, a decent mix of children humour and adult humour. The main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell)is likable and funny. The minions however are the main stars, they had me laughing on multiple occasions during the film. The language created for the minions is very well done as they speak in a fictional language but you can always gather what they are saying.I found the visuals very impressive, it was very colourful and very imaginative. The action scenes we also very well done.Would definitely recommend seeing this, no matter what your age. I am 22 and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not just for kids!",8,87,121,23 June 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Brilliant movie until the final 15 minutes where it takes a massive nose dive.
","Now, I knew going into this that it wasn't in the same ball park as the 2008 movie Cloverfield. I was aware of the basic plot but I had stayed clear of trailers and reviews before viewing it as I didn't want to ruin my viewing experience. It was painfully obvious that before I watched the movie it was going to have an alien/monster aspect. The fact that is is named Cloverfield and that I saw a movie poster of the house glowing like a spaceship pretty much confirmed to me, before viewing that there was to be some form of sci-fi element outside of the bunker. And when a movie spends most of its energy keeping you guessing to whether the outside world is infected, when its glaringly obvious (off my two previous points alone) that it actually will be, is a whopping plot hole in my personal opinion.The lead character Michelle is in a car crash, she awakes in a cell, chained to the wall by a mysterious man, Howard (played perfectly by John Goodman). He tells her that he found her and rescued her by taking her down into a bunker under his farmhouse as the outside world above ground level is toxic and it could take years to become safe for them to leave. It is obvious now that the vat majority of this movie is to be played out in the confined space of the underground bunker, filmed over 4 or 5 rooms, it has a dark, claustrophobic, tense feel to it. Bottled-up environments require good acting to make them work, if you are restricted to 3 characters for 90 minutes in a dialogue driven movie then the acting has to be top notch and convincing. And in 10 Cloverfield Lane, it was just that. The acting was very, very good, especially from John Goodman. He portrayed his character effortlessly, portraying a man who wasn't black or white, he was mysterious, compelling and awkward. He could take you from thinking he was an honest man, to thinking he is a psycho murderer within a matter of seconds. Without his presence, 10 Cloverfield Lane wouldn't have been half as effective.Throughout the movie we are kept guessing if Howard is a good guy or a bad guy. The plot shifts several times, one minute making you think that he is a genuine, honest man to then making you feel as if he is a psychopath, hiding a haunting past. This was interesting and I was very emerged into this aspect of the movie. He swore by the theory that the outside air was contaminated and he kept his prisoners there for their own safety and you were guessing whether this was genuine or if he was simply brainwashing them with fear tactics.In the end we aren't given the full backstory to Howards life, but enough evidence is there to point to the fact he was deranged. My theory is that his Wife/Daughter left him, he kidnapped the missing school girl and likely resulted in killing her through his depressed psychotic personality. He killed the other main character in the show, having a barrel of acid already prepared to dispose of the body and he had spent years building a bunker below his house for the possibility of an 'alien invasion' (or was it just a chamber where he kept and tortured people?). Either way, all the facts point at Howard being a unhinged, murdering mad man.Making a safety suit out of a shower curtain, half a Coca Cola bottle and some duct tape, in order to try and escape is simply ridiculous. Surely attack Howard first, then proceed to make your homemade suit would have been a more conventional way of doing things? Rather than trying to hide it from him? Bizarre storytelling to say the least.Ultimately, 10 Cloverfield Lane was a claustrophobic, well-acted, dialogue driven thriller which was played out very well until the final 15 minutes or so.Now, where to begin, trying to summarise this abomination of an ending?1 – The film was well paced and constructed perfectly, offering a really tense viewing with some scenes having an uneasy feel. This was ruined the second she was out of the bunker as it took a complete U-Turn going from 0 - Hollywood in a matter of seconds. 2- As I said earlier, I was expecting some Alien element outside of the bunker, with it being something I was expecting, I wouldn't have been completely against it, however the way in which it was executed was so poor that it just ruined the entire movie. If the aliens had been subtle and attacked with some better directing it could have been saved slightly.3 – Killing the 'alien' with a conveniently accessible cocktail Molotov, made of a magazine and a wine bottle, by being perfectly able to throw it into its open mouth whilst being dragged up towards it whilst in the seat of a car is just too much for me, I'm sorry. 4 – To finally escape and hear on the radio that survivors must head to Chicago, conveniently as she is driving past a road sign (in the middle of nowhere) that points towards Chicago, is again downright laughable and lazy.Ultimately it is a shame that the movie fell apart so quickly in the last 15 minutes, prior to the end scene I would have given it an 8/10 or even a 9/10 for the great scenes, acting and storytelling in the bunker. However due to the horrifically poor ending I will give it a 7/10 and I think that may be a little generous.",7,9,14,13 September 2016
The Equalizer," A film with many faults but having Denzel as the lead saved it from failure.
","Denzel Washington is one of my favourite actors of all time, if he's in a film that will one of the deciding factors to whether I go and see it or not. I think the Equalizer was made with this in mind, it is far from great, it feels lazy and lacks any real depth but they know that a film with Denzel as the lead will draw in the audiences.The script, pacing, storyline & character development all let this movie down in my opinion and when you add all of those to clichéd, predictable scenarios; it really doesn't make for a very good movie. The story is so over done that there is no way it can offer the viewer any surprises, we have seen this so many times before, from the plot to the characters to the scenarios, it all feels very repetitive. Denzel gives a good solid performance but he is hindered by the awful, basic, mind numbing script. He really wasn't given much to work with and the scenes where he was given large amounts of dialogue it just felt clichéd and predictable. I think it was trying to be one of those thinly plotted, action movies where you can switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is. I think it does a good job at being this apart from one major fault: The pacing. The poor script and lack of depth to the plot make it drag somewhat. It is simply too long for what it is; with a run time of over 2 hours it really drags in the middle. The first 30-40 minutes are good and intriguing and the final 30 minutes offer good action and some good scenes, the middle 45-50 minutes simply doesn't have enough about it to keep your attention.The Equalizer isn't without its positives though; Denzel Washington shows us another great, convincing performance, he really is a joy to watch. He plays a very likable character with ease; you always feel like you can connect with him as an actor, that is probably one of his greatest traits. The film looks brilliant; the settings are all faultless and expose a real gritty, atmosphere. Some of the scenes are very well done; the scenes at the start and the end scene in particular are well made and tense. The cinematography was given a lot of attention, the action scenes are very immersing, different approaches are used with slow motion shots and great music.Overall, The Equalizer has plenty of issues but also has many things which I like. It is easy watching, but that is about all. It isn't going to be remembered as a classic and it certainly isn't one of Denzel Washington's better films but it is entertaining enough. Just don't expect too much.6/10",6,8,11,3 March 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie.
","Tarantino takes on Hitler, no wonder so many people chose to hate this movie. Baffling however, why they chose to watch it in the first place as it's likely very certain that they knew they were not going to enjoy it.A quick scan through user reviews here on IMDb will show you an unbeieveble amount of reviews with 1/10 ratings claiming it's 'one of the worst films I have ever seen' or 'complete waste of time and money'. Why watch a movie from a director you don't like, complain about violence, long drawn out dialogue scenes and unorthodox story- telling of a controversial historical topic? Why complain about plot holes and rate is as 1/10 because of this? People don't like Tarantino yet they still pay their hard earned money and spend their precious time watching his movies at the cinema simply to go home and give their two cents worth of how awful it was and how unintelligent you have to be to be entertained by such garbage. Inglorious Basterds may not be perfect but it is exactly what I expected from a Tarantino film. It's violent yet not as violent as some of his other works, some of the scenes are graphic but nothing that I would class as morbidly excessive. The dialogue is impressive in stops and starts with a couple of the scenes in the movie being among his best work in terms of dialogue, the opening scene in particular was so tense and perfectly constructed that it truly did showcase Tarantino's skill at creating such great film. Setting the bar so high in the opening scene had a slight negative impact on the rest of the movie though as the remainder of the film couldn't live up to that first scene on the milk farm. Split into 5 chapters which is essentially 5 long scenes, Tarantino tells the story of a Nazi-occupied France during World War 2, following the harrowing journey of 'The Jew Killer', the backlash of the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the story of a Jew with cold revenge on her mind. There is no sole focus on any one character as the story isn't told through anyone's perspective, the story simply moves through the different characters scene by scene.We are lead to believe from the movie title and trailer that the movie will focus completely around The Inglorious Basterds. This isn't the case and they act as a cog in a big wheel of different characters, they never really feel like the main people, we are given little back story to them and develop no emotional attachment to them. Brad Pitt was the poster boy for this movie yet he didn't feature half as much as I thought he would and sadly the screen time he did get was quite disappointing. His character wasn't very interesting and contained far too many clichés, often looking out of place and struggling to adapt completely to his role. Some of his script did however add some humor to the movie but the better scenes in the movie were ones which he wasn't a part of. Christoph Waltz was fascinating as 'The Jew Hunter', his calm and somewhat friendly persona makes him so edgy giving you the feeling that he could do anything at any moment. His performance was completely faultless which was by far the strongest aspect of Inglorious Basterds and the best scenes of this movie are ones which he was in. There are some big plot holes in this movie, which i will not go into as they would contain big spoilers. The plot holes didn't stop me enjoying this movie though as it isn't a movie of realism, you would be a fool to believe that Inglorious Basterds was trying to even attempt that. I don't necessarily think it is down to lazy writing either, I personally think that some of the plot conveniences were purely to move the movie along. Tarantino may have stuggled to fit all of the story he wanted to tell into the two and a half hour run-time and in doing so, possibly in the trimming down process to keep it a respectable length, some of the the plot lines got a little choppy and dysfunctional. Overall, Inglorious Basterds is a movie made for my tastes so my rating will be high. I can see it isn't a perfect movie and I can acknowledge these flaws however I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said that I didn't enjoy it. The time flew by and i found myself completely captivated in the story, the tense scenes made me tense, the humor hit the spot, the violence was graphic and uncut and the climax to the movie felt fitting and powerful. Tarantino creates a unique movie experience on a topic which was never going to please anyone. He made complete fiction out of one of the most notoriously disgusting people in the history of the world and did it completely on his terms. I have no issues with that whatsoever.8/10",8,2,6,26 January 2017
The Others," The perfect example of how to create a ghost story.
","The Others is one of my favourite horror films of all time. It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched. If horror movies are your scene then I would recommend this very highly.9/10",9,4,5,3 February 2015
Chicken Run," A pen of chickens, desperate for escape and running out of options are given a new hope when a flying American rooster lands in their coup.
","Filmed entirely using Claymation technology (the same style used for the Wallace and Gromit animations), gave Chicken Run a different feel to your usual animated movie. The animation certainly isn't to everybody's taste, it doesn't look as impressive or as polished as standard animation but for me it wasn't a problem, within a few minutes I was completely used to it and barely noticed it to be different from then on.An almost all English cast worked well for the movie with the only American being Mel Gibson, playing Rocky the Rooster. This created the opportunity for the chickens to look up to the Rooster as some sort of celebrity, a foreigner who was like something they had never seen before.There are many references to great British movies through the film, some of which I picked up on and others which I have read of since watching it. Chicken Run does have a strong British feel to it, however I can't help but feel that just the inclusion of one American character made it feel a little too American. Mel Gibson stood out like a sore thumb, now I'm not saying he didn't fit the part and play a vital role, I just think that some of the jokes and amateur dramatics would have been better suited to the movie if they were a little less Americanized.On the most part the comedy is fresh and I found myself laughing on several occasions. It's a feel good flick; it's as simple as that. Its relatively predictable and plays out containing all the clichés you would expect from a movie of this genre. Overall, It isn't a perfect movie and I don't feel it contains any real wow factor and it misses the mark on any real emotion in my opinion. However the casting is done well enough, the jokes hit the mark on the most part, the animation is impressive when you consider the effort it must have taken to produce it and it is a decent way to pass the time on a rainy Sunday Afternoon, as I did.8/10",8,0,0,12 September 2016
Home Alone," A Christmas Classic
","It's that time of year again, the time of year when it is acceptable to binge on Christmas films. The first one I watched this year was Home Alone. It is a classic for me, certainly a child hood favourite!The story is a very simple one; Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is accidentally left at Home over the Christmas as his whole family fly to Paris. They board the plane without realising that they have left one of their Children home alone! Two small time robbers are also in the area, looking to break into houses, they target the McCallister household as they believe they are all away for the Christmas holidays. It is now up to Kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks, some of which are absolutely brilliant! The two Robbers; Marv & Harry, played by Daniel Stern & Joe Pesci, give fantastic performances. They portray the classic dumb & dumber routine. Harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader & Marv plays the really stupid, gullible one who falls for much more simple traps. The on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic, it comes across very realistic and hilarious.Macaulay Culkin was 9 or 10 when Home Alone was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance. The Home Alone films are pretty much all he has been known for, which is a shame really, he had a few other films but none are as well-known and successful as these. Of course this isn't the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios, but who cares. It's fun! It's Christmassy & It's got great characters with some truly hilarious moments.Overall, Home Alone is a very fun movie; I have the relation to it as it was always on at Christmas when I was a child. But even if this isn't the case, I'm sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child!8/10",9,6,7,8 December 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," Visually stunning, perfectly done & thoroughly entertaining
","I never saw the original Tintin cartoons and before this film new nothing about it.I watched this film this evening, two years after its release .. and i'm left thinking, why did I not watch this film before now?! This was such an enjoyable film, it was much, much better than i thought it was going to be, there are so many great things about this movie:THE VISUALS: Easily one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen, i wish i had watched this at the cinema - especially in 3d. The animation is perfect. it's bright, colourful and scarily lifelike. The characters, scenery and landscapes all look incredible and so creative. Even the opening credits look fantastic! I can't stress how good the visuals are in this film.THE DIRECTION: Spielberg has done an incredible job here, nothing could have been improved in this aspect. The way the movie flows and the way the scenes intertwine and change is beautiful. There are scenes where it switches from past to present and back again in such a way that you just get lost in it.. you will understand what i mean when you see the movie. There are scenes of fights and chases which are so creative and so imaginative, the way he uses angles and the way everything links on is a real joy to watch. Its hard to explain, watch the film and you will know exactly what I mean.However, the film is not just a visual feast like many films are. It has a good solid story with likable, interesting characters - I found the story line kept my attention throughout. A very original adventure/quest film, searching for hidden treasure and defeating the bad guys along the way!I cannot recommend this film enough, i was so surprised by just how good it was. As i said earlier I am sorry I didn't go and see this in the cinema as it really would have been a fantastic experience. Watch it!",9,36,39,24 June 2013
Snatch," Perfection
","Everything about Snatch is perfect. The casting, script, storyline, creativity, editing, soundtrack and direction are all outstanding. I literally do not have a single fault with this movie, to me; it is one of the greatest examples of how a film should be made.The casting is brilliant, every actor transforms themselves into their character superbly, and there isn't a single actor who doesn't give a convincing performance. Snatch is so successful thanks to its flawless script, every scene is perfect with countless memorable one liners such as: 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?', 'Protection from what? 'Zee Germans'?', 'I'm sorry, I couldn't get the bin-noc-u-lars out in time' & 'You'll raise Hell. Never mind pulses'. It is hilarious one moment & tense the next.There are two plot points in the movie, the chase of an extremely valuable diamond and the organisation of an illegal underground boxing fight. It is a story that involves a boxing promoter, a fat getaway driver, a wheeler dealer who pretends to be a Jew, a diamond dealer, a gangster who feeds his victims to his pig farm, an aggressive Gypsie, a hit-man and a sneaky f****** Russian!The pace of this movie is spot on; it doesn't slow down from the first second to the last. There are so many different characters and the story switches between them often but not once do you get confused, which is usually very hard to achieve. It is so well made and the characters are that convincing and have so much depth that you feel for every single character. They are all likable in their own way. You can tell this is a Guy Ritchie movie straight away, his directors style is shown off to its fullest here. The camera angles, the edits, the sound effects & the soundtrack are all done to perfection. The Soundtrack is fantastic, so many brilliant tunes are included and they are picked carefully so nothing feels out of place.When you mix great actors, with fantastic characters, give them a faultless script and let Guy Ritchie direct the whole thing, you are bound to create something special. I cannot stress to you how good this movie is. Go and watch it, now!10/10",10,0,3,12 January 2015
Elf," A Festive Favourite
","A festive favourite.Every year as Christmas approaches I look forward to watching my usual Christmas movies. Elf is always one that I watch, every single year without fail, it is everything a Christmas film should be and much more! Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls in to Santa's sack when a baby one Christmas Eve & is accidentally taken back to the North Pole. Santa and his Elves realise that he must have crawled in as Santa visited an orphanage & as he has no parents, one of the elves steps forward and raises him. The story then fast forwards 20 years or so and Buddy leaves the North Pole and travels to New York to find his real Dad (who happens to be on the naughty list!!).Will Ferrell does an incredibly good job at playing his part and the supporting cast are equally as good. There are no rude or edgy bits (which is unusual for a Will Ferrell movie) and it is very much a family film, suitable for all ages! Elf is a real festive, feel good, classic Christmas film with a great cast, fantastic story and many hilarious moments.9/10",8,0,0,23 December 2014
American Sniper," Very tough to review, I have very mixed feelings about this movie.
","American Sniper was one of those films that carried a massive hype, everybody was talking about it upon its release and it seemed that everybody, other than myself had seen it. Because of this hype I was expecting an experience that was vastly above average, sadly I was a disappointed. American Sniper is a well-made movie and I did enjoy it but it was nowhere near as good as I was expecting/ hoping that it would be. Since watching this movie I have seen many negative reviews online from people who were genuinely offended by this movie. They believed it to be an insult to American Citizens and a generalization of the Iraq population, portraying them (men women and children) to be all bad and evil. Having read reviews and re-thought on American Sniper, I can now appreciate these people opinions and sadly this movie has huge questionable issues.American Sniper shows a blindly biased account of war from an American Citizen, with no real motive or intention apart from a flashback or him killing a deer as a child, getting cheated on by his girlfriend and most importantly; seeing 9/11 unfold on the TV. American Story is another Hollywood blockbuster which tries to convince the audience that glorifies war and gives another ignorant biased view of life on the frontline. War movies are always a touchy genre, they can often glamorise war and make it seem that everything is acceptable in the name of 'fighting for your country'. The plot of American Sniper states that It follows the story of his struggle to deal with real life and how returning home from war is such a difficult task. We hardly see any of this though; we don't get much story of his time with his family. There is little, if any, character development, Chris Kyle is portrayed as a killing machine, no conscience murderer, then on the other hand they give a half-hearted attempt of showing him as a family man, riddled with guilt over the war. It all feels very confused and lacks identity. The biggest positive of this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He has really developed a name for himself over recent years with some great performances and American Sniper is another great example of his acting ability. The supporting cast all do a respectable job and the direction of the movie is also satisfactory. The action War scenes are very well done and choreographed well, they don't contain endless shots of 'shaky cam' which makes for much easier viewing. When I initially watched this I didn't pick up on the negative points so much, I enjoyed the movie on first viewing, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it was still a good movie. However I now cannot help but realise the huge negatives that this film contains. I knew nothing of Chris Kyle but having researched him after viewing this movie I can now agree with many of the negative reviews on here. He was portrayed as a war hero, his real life personality and actions are displayed as black and white in this movie which is simply not the case in real life.Overall as a movie: It was a decent paced war film with solid acting but lacked any depth, identity and powerful scenes. Rating this movie on the movie alone I would give it a 7/10. However having researched the back story and real life events I find it hard to view this movie in a positive light and I can completely appreciate the bad reviews and controversy that surround American Sniper.",7,0,4,25 June 2015
21 Jump Street," 1st time I watched it I hated it, 2nd time round I loved it!
","I watched this not long after its release and I found it incredibly tedious and didn't enjoy it at all. Now, after the release and hype of 22 Jump Street I felt like I was missing out so I re-watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend and loved it! It is a very, very funny!Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's on screen chemistry is fantastic. The film starts with them at school and from the start it highlights how completely opposite they are. They have many opposing personalities and attributes but they fit together perfectly. Jonah is the clever, sensible unpopular kid at school and Tatum is the cool, sporty popular kid at school. The film zooms forward 7 years to them both graduating Police Academy and from then, their chemistry really comes to life. Not long after they are sent back to School undercover as students. The whole cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Ice Cube are the stand outs for me. Ice Cube plays the role that he plays best: the angry, no nonsense & outspoken boss. It is certainly refreshing to see Tatum move away from his rom-com style films he is usually associated with and put in an equally impressive performance. Jonah however plays his usual role with crude jokes and unprovoked use of bad language; this isn't necessarily a bad thing though as it compliments Tatum's character very well.The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It makes many references throughout which mimic action movies and their clichés. The car bonnet slides, the delayed explosions and the use of firearms are a few examples of this. It is a great mix of subtle one liners and slap stick action comedy scenes. I would certainly recommend this film and I am still struggling to remember why I dismissed this movie as awful upon first watch a couple of years ago!8/10",8,0,1,11 August 2014
Predator," If it bleeds, we can kill it..
","Predator is regarded as one of the most well-known action movies of the 80's & certainly one of Arnie's best performances. It has everything you would expect from a classic 80's action flick, explosions, guns, blood, suspense & classic one-liners from Arnie! Arnie and his team of commandos are called in to assist with a rescue mission in a Central American Jungle, a helicopter has gone down and they are sent in to locate any survivors. Before long they become targeted themselves by an alien hunter which starts killing them off one by one.The scenes before we see the Predator are very iconic and it is at that moment that you realise it is not your standard action flick. The first time we are introduced to the Predator is from its point of view. The crew of commandos will be down on the floor of the jungle and then it will switch to an infrared point of view from a birds eye location, watching them from the trees. You are shown the predator watching the humans, whilst making quite disturbing noises and breathing sounds. They are very effective scenes that add suspense and a nervous feeling to this movie. One thing which is done very well is that the Predator is not revealed too early, it is not fully seen until around half way into the movie. This does a great job of adding suspense and a 'we are more scared of what we can't see' effect.The gore is just about right also, there is enough gore to show you how vicious the Predator is but it is not over the top. There are no real stomach turning scenes. Arnie does a good job, as does Bill Duke, other members of the cast can be quite annoying or simply drift into the back ground and aren't really cared about once they start getting picked off by Predator.The story line is Interesting and it adds something different to a standard Arnie action flick. If you like this genre then you have probably already seen it as it is regarded as a classic. It's not really a genre that I have a large interest in and this is why I haven't seen it until now! 7/10",7,0,1,30 October 2014
Grease," One of the most iconic musicals of all time
","Let me start by saying that I do not normally like musicals, in fact with Grease being a musical it put me off watching it until i was well into my 20's. Having watched it last night I can only say that I am disappointed that I didn't see it sooner. Plenty of iconic songs, superb dancing & choreography and an incredible cast.The story is simple and has the classic high school love story vibe, Boy and Girl like each other & boy doesn't want to admit to his friends that he is in love. 1) The music Everybody knows the main Grease songs such as Summer Lovin', Grease lightning and The one that I want. But believe me, there are many more fantastic songs that just those 3, there are maybe 10-12 songs over the duration of the movie and every single one fits perfect to the picture.2)Dancing & Choreography What can I say about John Travolta, it really surprised me how much of a great dancer he was. The whole cast put in great performances and the stages/scenes are created perfectly offering really interesting and sometimes outrageous dance scenes. 3) The Cast John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are fantastic as leads in this movie, I couldn't fault them one bit. There on screen chemistry, especially when dancing is perfect. The supporting cast do their job and bring depth and excitement to the scenes.Overall i was thoroughly impressed with Grease, I went into it not expecting much as I said before, I don't usually like musicals. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for an easy watching, feel good film with a great soundtrack!",7,1,2,17 July 2014
American Beauty," Great Film
","American Beauty is widely considered as one of the best films of the 90's and by some, one of the best films of all time. It has a great cast, great characters and superb acting. The story follows a year in the life of two families, living next door to each other, who appear to be different on the outside but extremely similar behind closed doors. One family appears as a classic appearing American, suburban family, a well off Mum and Dad and a spoilt moody teenager who seems to hate the world. Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who is suffering from depression and falls into a midlife crisis as he became infatuated in his teenage daughters new best friend (played by Mena Suvari). The family next door consists of an Ex-Marine father, his wife and their withdrawn, anti-social teenage son, who films his entire life on his video camera.American Beauty is an emotional film that really makes you think about life and the day to day struggles that so many people in this world face. If you scratch slightly below the surface you see what families like this can be like. Kevin Spacey plays a fantastic role as Lester, his is able to get the message across that Depression is serious and that it is ruining his life but he also adds just enough humour, and he is a really likable character. The script is brilliant and makes telling this story very convincing and believable. Kevin Spacey also narrates the movie, I found this to be a nice touch and very effective as you hear what is going on inside the mind of a man suffering from depression.Overall I would recommend this film to anybody looking for a movie with a strong storyline and convincing acting, if you are in a low mood and looking for a pick-me-up movie, then I would avoid this!9/10",9,0,1,22 January 2015
Ratatouille," Ratatouille is another movie, within a long, long list of very successful and consistently brilliant Pixar films.
","Ratatouille follows the story of a rat named Remy, with big dreams, ambition and courage. A rat who is bored of eating scraps out of the garbage and dreams of mixing flavours of fresh food to create better tastes! In Paris he discovers a world famous restaurant where he can't help but improve an awful pot of soup by adding his own flavours! The garbage/cleaner boy is accused of interfering with the soup which everybody now loves and is forced to repeat his recipe. This is where Remy the rat comes into play, sitting within the boys hat and instructing him on how to be a good chef!Personally I wouldn't say that Ratatouille is one of Pixar's t most impressive films, this is due to the constant high standard of content they produce, but it is significantly better than your average animated movie. It contains all the ingredients that a Pixar movie should; it's funny, cute, heart-warming, creative and contains all the appropriate values and messages you would expect. It contains all the clichÃ©s that we have come to expect from animated movies but this isn't something that I can mark this movie down on, it certainly didn't discourage my opinion of the movie.The settings created are beautiful, the landscapes, alleyways and canals of France, plus the accents of the characters are realistic and believable. The choreography is also very impressive, especially the kitchen scenes; they are very well created and flow perfectly.Overall I would recommend Ratatouille if you haven't already seen it, like the vast majority of Pixar movies, it is a film for all ages!8/10",8,0,1,15 September 2015
The Lego Movie," A refreshing animation which does practically everything right. An instant classic.
","I wasn't sure what to expect as I sat down to watch this movie, was it to be too childish, or will it be geared towards impressing adults also? Too heavy on the Lego promotion? Was it to have a solid story or be a weak mish-mash of brainless money spinning tripe? As the credits rolled at the end of the movie I can honestly say I have not been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in a long, long time. Hands down, it is fantastic.The Lego Movie has heart, it has substance and great energy. It's clever, really clever and I appreciate the level of effort and thinking that has gone into making this movie. It is laugh out loud funny, not only in a slapstick way but also through witty dialogue and intelligent, sharp humour. The universe created for The Lego Movie is one of the greatest aspects, the attention to detail is fantastic and nothing ever looks out of place with some brilliantly witty props and surroundings. With spot on casting the Lego characters are brought to life, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all play their part especially well in their supporting roles.  The story is a simple one, easy to follow but is told in an imaginative and well paced with a good array of characters, clichéd but pleasant. It's the classic unassuming hero story, good vs potential evil with friendship and loyalty the driving points being the mission. There are plenty of funny moments, some surprisingly downbeat scenes and some well choreographed action sequences.My only real negative is that I feel it was geared a little too heavily towards 3d viewing and when viewing in standard 2d it can feel a little over the top and choppy at times. It's clear which parts would look great in 3d but when viewed standard some scenes can look like quite poor animation.Towards the end, the movie makes a bold move, a move which could quite easily have backfired and undone all the greatness. Thankfully it was pulled off extremely well, delivering just how they wanted it to and didn't feel remotely wrong in any way.The creators got it spot on. Promote Lego to the hills, kids will love so many aspects of it, adults will love it too and the money will come rolling in for sequels, this is a new Universe for the animation genre and I can see it continuing for many years to come. The Batman Lego Movie was released this year and with such an array of characters at their disposal, I expect to see plenty more movies in the future.A very solid 9/10",9,0,1,11 June 2017
Now You See Me," Different than I thought .. Although that's not a bad thing
","This film had a bit of everything... Action, comedy, suspense and even romance.The story was interesting enough, basic but interesting. The visuals were good and the cinematography was well done.I felt the cast were very well picked and came across together very well. Woody Harrelson was brilliant in this film, very quirky and interesting.The movie is very well paced, from the 1st minute to the last I found myself very entertained and didn't once feel my attention slipping. The main scenes in the movie come and go very well and it never feels as if they are dragging out a scene/situation.The only gripes I have of this movie is the character development. I found it near non existent. I didn't feel as if i cared much for any of the characters, be it the magicians or the FBI. The film is so fast paced and it didn't seem to slow to build any characters stories.The magic scenes are good, the cat and mouse chase scenes are good but I still can't help feel disappointed about the weak character development, especially with it being such a strong cast.I would recommend this film to anyone, plenty of twists and turns, laughs and suspense to keep you thoroughly entertained.8/10",8,1,4,4 July 2013
Inside Out," Very intelligent and beautifully created. Another masterpiece from Pixar.
","I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews for this movie, I have seen almost every Pixar movie and this is up there with the best of them and is beyond doubt one of the most intelligent films they have created. Now, I can understand how people with young children were disappointed as I do believe that the message and themes in the movie are too mature for toddlers, but to mark a film as 1 out of 10 because of this isn't fair at all.. Inside Out should be appreciated for what it is and rated accordingly.Inside Out is the story of a young girl called Riley, she is 11 and her family have left their suburban life and relocated to San Francisco, leaving behind all of Riley's friends and hobbies. In her new town she Is forced to fit in at school, keep a brave face for her Parents and adapt to the everyday changes of living in a busy city. The majority of the movie is based inside Riley's brain with her emotions playing the roles of physical characters - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust. When Riley's 'buttons are pushed' by others, the characters physically push buttons in her brain, determining what emotions she is feeling and what expressions she comes out with in real life.I don't want to give anything away in terms of the story as the trailers have done an unusually good job of not revealing any of the plot points. All I will say is that Inside Out is an incredibly creative movie which transports its viewers into a breath- taking environment with some fantastic aspects. The characters used are all executed very well and fit together perfectly creating some very good on screen chemistry and touching relationships.I would say that Inside Out will be enjoyed by teens and adults much more than young children as the story and values are quite complex. I imagine it would still hold the attention of young children as it is extremely colourful with plenty of different characters. However the slap-stick humour is toned down and I found that much of the comedy came from witty one-liners and the metaphors that are used, many of which would be missed by young children.Personally I didn't find Inside Out to be a 'perfect' movie and I do have a couple of negatives. The scene we see in the trailer where we are shown into other human's brains and seeing how their emotions are stereotyped and interact with each other, was hilarious. I would have loved to have seen more of this to break up the main story which was unfolding in Riley's brain. We see some more shots during the end credits of this but I certainly feel that this concept was underused. The only other negative I have is that around the midpoint of the movie, some aspects started to feel a little repetitive, I won't explain what these are as I don't want to ruin any of the plot but when you watch it I am sure you will understand what I am referring to. I was left with a very positive message after viewing Inside Out but I won't tell you what it was as it would, again, ruin the movie! I will however say that it was a positive one and in Pixar's usual way, it ended on an emotional note which I imagine would have made many people shed a tear! Overall Inside Out is funny, intelligent, emotional and has a creative, artistic feel to it which was relatable on so many levels. It contained strong metaphors which left me appreciating how clever this movie really was, I would certainly welcome a sequel, the ending certainly gave me the impression that a sequel was on the cards but I have since read that there isn't any plans to create one.9/10",9,7,41,12 August 2015
Die Hard 2," Entertaining Sequel
","Firstly I will start by getting the comparisons with the first Die Hard out of the way. For me, Die Hard 2 lacks the same tension that its predecessor has; it doesn't have many scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. It seems a lot more over the top and predictable. Bruce Willis is just the same but he does have quite a few more cheesy one liners and some of them felt a little forced and awkward. The story is very similar to the first (terrorists, hostages, his wife etc.) but that didn't bother me to be honest.It's Christmas again and John McClane is in Washington waiting at the airport for the plane to land with his wife on board. He notices some suspicious looking activity and shortly after things escalate out of the control. A terrorist group has taken control of the air traffic control and leaves several planes circling the skies (one of which has McClanes wife on board), running low on fuel and unable to land until their demands are met. The police force and security there don't want to talk orders from McClane so he again, takes matters into his own hands. McClane uses everything and anything he can get his hands on to stop the terrorists in time, including machine guns, knives, snow mobiles, helicopters and even suitcases!Die Hard 2 is an entertaining action flick with everything you would expect from a film of this genre from this time period. Its main problem is it just isn't as good as the first Die Hard and you cannot help but compare whilst watching it. Die Hard 2 just feels a lot slower and creates much less tension, it seems to take quite a while to get going and the action scenes seem to come in stages, it feels like you will have a decent action scene and then nothing for 20-30 minutes or so. It is only 120 minutes long but it does feel like it is dragging its heels at times. Die Hard 2 does push the boat out in the action scenes though, it can be quite violent at times and there are plenty of explosions! The Villain, played by William Atherton isn't doesn't have the same presence as the villain in the first movie.Overall, if you compare it to the first Die Hard it isn't great, but if you view it as a standalone film; which I think you should, it is an enjoyable action flick! Personally I found it more entertaining than I was expecting and as far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is a pretty good one!7/10",7,1,2,26 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Quirky, witty and a lot of fun!
","I'm not going to go into much detail on the storyline as I don't want to ruin anything; I will simply state the reasons why I enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel.Gustave H is an eccentric, colourful, well established hotel concierge who runs the Grand Budapest Hotel using his own quirky style and approach. He has a lobby boy named Zero Mustafa who he works alongside. Before long the two of them are swept into a series of events that bring them closer, turning them from concierge and lobby boy into loyal friends.The Grand Budapest Hotel is directed by Wes Anderson, meaning that it is going to have a Wes Anderson style quirky twist. People have criticised this movie for this, stating that it is trying too hard to be different, I don't agree with this at all. Yes it is different, yes it is quirky and eccentric but it is magical in its own deserved right. It sucked me into the setting and made me feel much immersed in the movie. The Cinematography is faultless, many scenes are filmed on a back drop that is designed to look like a painting, there are scenes that look gimmicky and there are scenes that feel as if you are watching it in a live play! But these are the reasons that The Grand Budapest Hotel is so enjoyable to watch! The humour is fantastic, it is incredibly witty, and the timing of the punch lines and the use of foul language is done splendidly. Ralph Fiennes who plays Gustave H, the hotel concierge is an incredibly likable and well-presented character. His lobby boy, Zero Mustafa is equally as pleasant and their on screen chemistry grows from nothing in the beginning into a real on screen treat. The supporting cast are also very well picked and they all play their character roles equally well, many of which are well- known faces such as Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, Bill Murray and Jude Law.If you were the split the film into three sections of beginning, middle and end, and were to compare the pace of the film I would say that it dips in the middle section. It starts off fantastically, you are introduced to the characters in a staggered routine and this keeps you hooked, waiting for who is to come next and what role they are to play. The middle does slow down a little and some of the scenes don't live up to the beginning section. It is still entertaining and kept me hooked, but because the beginning was so strong I think the middle seemed deflated because of this. In my opinion It felt slower paced, the two main characters were shown less screen time during this period and I think the film suffered a little because of this. It did however pick up in the final third and the pace was similar to that of the opening part. It ended strongly and left me very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.The Grand Budapest Hotel succeeds due to great direction, cinematography, script and humour. Its characters are fantastic and some of my favourite characters that I have seen in recent films are on display here. The film is only 90 minutes long but this doesn't stop some impressive character development. I can appreciate that this movie isn't for everyone and it has suffered some poor reviews because of this, but in my opinion it was much better than I was expecting and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has since been nominated for Best Picture and I wouldn't argue with that one bit.8/10",9,4,7,29 January 2015
The Imitation Game," Benedict Cumberbatch with another faultless performance
","Admittedly, I knew nothing of this story prior to viewing The Imitation Game. Having now watched the movie I feel a little embarrassed that I had no knowledge of this true and quite remarkable story. The story follows Alan Turing, a mathematician during WW2. He approaches the government applying for a 'top secret' job which is to help England de-code a German communications system known as Enigma. Each day the communications system is reset and scrambled, this gives Turing and his team only 18 hours every day before the code is changed and all their hard work is worthless. There are 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible codes each day which would of course be impossible; this is when Turing sets out to create a machine, a machine to beat the German machine. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a truly incredible performance; he is rapidly becoming one of the best actors of today's movie scene and certainly one of my favourite actors to date. He opens up beautifully is this movie and lets you in, he allows you to connect with his character and puts in a flawlessly emotion driven performance. He is playing a character based on a real person but doesn't allow this is stop him making the role his own. His character is socially awkward, arrogant to people around him and very witty. The supporting cast are all impressive and fit believably into the settings and story lines.Based in the South of England during the Second World War is a setting that is not new to cinema, it has been done plenty of times before. The Imitation Game stays true to the times and produces fantastic sets and perfect costumes. The language used, mannerisms of the characters and the image of the working class v the upper class is portrayed as you would expect.The story is of course a well-known one but it does branch off several times and takes the viewer into a different period. The Imitation Game flicks between three different time periods: The man story is in the 1940's but it jumps back ten years to when Alan was a child and also forwards ten years to a time after the WW2 events. This is done superbly and it made in such a way that it flows well and doesn't once leave you confused. The feature is also complemented with real life news snippets of the war, television recording and radio samples; this is not overdone and is used quite subtlety - a fantastic addition in my eyes.Unlike me, many of you will more than likely know this touching story but I will not say too much in case there are a few of you who do not! The Imitation Game is a story of courage, dedication and cruelty. It makes you laugh one minute and cry the next but overall it gave me a very emotional experience. It really does open your eyes to a world with respect and views which seem a million years in the past but shamefully existed less than a century ago.8/10",8,1,4,27 May 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Artistic
","It certainly isn't for all audiences; it does not try to cater for everyone, if you know this is not your scene then why watch it and why review it negatively? Kill Bill: Volume 1 is classic Tarantino, it is extreme, it is graphic and it certainly does not hold back. The direction is perfect, the fight scenes are beautiful, this is film making, this is art. Visually this film is nothing short of Stunning. There is one scene where the lights go out and a fight commences against a light back drop and all we see is the shadows of the fighters, no gore, no CGI, just raw martial arts. Beautiful. The scene where Uma Thurman faces the '88' is perfect, it is a long martial arts scene, probably over 15 minutes long and not at one point does it get boring. Tarantino somehow manages to film that and keep it looking uncluttered and not clumsy, it is very stylish. Some of the sword fights are filmed majestically – the camera shots used and the way the fights are created is truly breath-taking. The settings/environments are great and so much detail goes into every single scene. The fight scenes of course aren't realistic & the blood looks fake – this is what everybody forgets – it is supposed to look like that. This is Tarantino; he made it to be over the top Kung Fu action flick, a tribute to these films, with of course, a Tarantino twist. Tarantino has got to be the only director who could add this soundtrack to scenes of copious amounts of gore and martial arts yet make it feel normal. Straight from the opening scene it has an atmosphere; it bursts straight into life and rarely slows down for the duration of the movie. Uma Thurman is fantastic, she really shows off her abilities in this, there may not be a strong script for her to work with but she is extremely convincing during her 'revenge' mission – especially in the action scenes. Tarantino is often known for his script and dialogue writing abilities, this is what often sets his films apart from its competitors. In Kill Bill this is not necessarily the case, the film does not focus on this as such, this time he goes for violence, and lots of it!One thing I didn't like about Kill Bill was the short animated feature about a third of the way through the movie. Personally, I didn't feel it was necessary but I can appreciate that it would appeal to some audiences. All in all I don't see the hate for his movie, sure if it is not your genre then you will clearly not enjoy it. If you like Tarantino, you like Martial Arts, you like gore & you like well-acted, well-choreographed movies then I don't see how this won't be a hit with you! The ending is great, and certainly keeps me interested whilst I wait for Volume 2 to arrive.9/10",9,1,4,12 August 2014
Toy Story," A childhood favourite
","Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness. The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do! Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults. The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.A timeless classic. 10/10",10,1,2,24 October 2014
Elysium," Nice Visuals, below par story.
","Like many modern Hollywood Blockbuster flicks, Elysium had spectacular visuals and a below par, uninteresting, lazy plot and script.Earth is an apocalyptic waste land which is home to the poor and Elysium is a halo in space which is where all the wealthy people live. On Elysium there is no sickness or disease, no poverty and no conflict. They have the technology to cure terminal illness; the air is pure with no pollution and the wealthy live long, healthy lives. Nobody leaves Elysium and nobody enters.I will start with the positives; the visuals are stunning. The contrasting settings between Earth and Elysium are breath- taking. The apocalyptic esc Earth wasteland is something that has been done many times before and in Elysium it looks extra gritty and rundown. Elysium is bright, colourful and magnificent; the living spaces are open and grand: It looks like perfection.Elysium simply contains too many moments which are far too convenient or stupid. Characters do daft things with no explanation because the directors couldn't be bothered to think of plausible ways for story lines to unfold. There is one instance where somebody breaks into Elysium and immediately finds the machine which can cure her daughter and then immediately knows how to use it, very convenient to say the least..The Storyline is predictable, clichéd and shallow. The early childhood romance flashbacks are forced and convenient. Matt Damon does an OK job with what he has been given, but ultimately the script Iets him down massively. The 'bad' characters are not interesting in the slightest, they are forcing the intimidating routine but fail miserably. Jodie Foster is horrific. Two dimensional with no character depth or explanation as to why her actions are as they are.Matt Damon becomes terminally ill in the most ludicrous way and mopes around for a few days dying. Then he put on some sort of tech suit which gives him strength, shortly following this he heads to Elysium to Save Earth.This review is boring me now, almost as much as Elysium did.. 3/10 – for the visuals alone.",3,0,1,23 July 2015
Beauty and the Beast," It's not the worst movie but when compared to the original its not even in the same league
","As a fan of the original Walt Disney Beauty and the Beast I was quite looking forward to seeing the live action adaption of the story. The trailers looked interesting and following on from Jungle Book last year, I was hoping for a similarly impressive remake.Beauty and the Beast is a story many of us will know, A poor farm girl gets taken hostage by a Beast, who is under a spell to stop him from returning the his human form as a Prince. The only way the Beast can return to his previous form is if he learns to love another and is loved in return. 'Only true love can break the spell', as it were. One of my biggest gripes about this movie was that the auto tune is simply horrific. If an actress cannot sing then an actress cannot sing, simple as that. You could try singing and editing it slightly to make do, or you could simply recast the actress and get someone in who can actually sing, to star in a musical, a Disney musical. What you shouldn't do it auto tune the life out of someone's voice to the point that it sounds as far away from lifelike as possible. However, saying that, all the original songs are there, and even if they are sang badly, they still gave me some nice nostalgia. Following on from the recent Jungle Book adaptation which delivered some of the most impressive CGI that I have ever seen so I was expecting much of the same here. Some of the shots and sequences looked very sharp and beautiful with vibrant colour. Some of the scenes with the live household goods looked impressive and the shots of the castle generally looked very good - especially the library scene and the dancing scenes. However some of the backdrops and landscapes looked quite poor at times, the scene in which Belle runs to the top of the hill near the start of the movie singing and we get a panoramic shot, it simply screams 'green-screen'. The Beast looks cheap at times and not what he should look like, his movements are often not too lifelike and rather wooden. They used motion capture for The Beast to make him as lifelike as possible but when you compare that to movies such as The Planet of the Apes franchise and how they move, you can really see the difference in quality. The scenes in the villages look like something out of a stage play, with lots of close up shots and choppy camera work.My motto is 'if it isn't broke, don't fix it'. Beauty and the Beast stayed true to the original story with only a couple of subplots and changes, but even with that in mind, it really was missing the magic of the original. The great thing about the animation Beauty and the Beast was the way it connected with us on an emotional, really heartfelt level. A cartoon story between a girl and a Beast, crammed into a runtime of under 90 minutes could still deliver heart and emotion, something which the new adaptation completely missed. The scenes between Belle and The Beast feel awkward. The characters were all very bland and not once did I feel invested or rooting for any of them. Something was definitely missing here. In the original the Beast was a beast for much more of his life and was more out of touch of human interaction however in this version he was transformed into a beast much later on in his life and subsequently is more intellectual, meaning that the relationship he has with Belle is more on a human level.   The movie felt 30 minutes too long, at just over a 2 hour runtime I felt it dragging around the middle period. The pacing was a little off and I did find it boring as time went on.Overall, I have very mixed opinions on Beauty and the Beast. Part of me liked it and part of me didn't. It seemed to do an OK job of retelling the story but ultimately felt flat and emotionless. It's a beautiful story which is completely driven on emotion however we really didn't see much emotion and that was disappointing. It isn't as impressive as Jungle Book and it is leagues behind the original Beauty and the Beast animated movie.5/10",5,5,8,27 June 2017
Pulp Fiction," A Masterpiece.
","There is not much that can be said about Pulp Fiction that hasn't been said countless times before, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and is never far away from the number one spot on many peoples lists. Acting – Spot on. Characters – Spot on.Script – Spot on. Storyline – almost non-existent but isn't that the point? Spot on. Soundtrack – Spot on. Editing – Spot on. Quentin Tarantino – Genius.Pulp Fiction is a complete joy to watch. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson give the performances of their careers. Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames & 'The Wolf' all give great supporting performances also.Pulp Fiction is an utterly pointless film; it is a movie that relies heavily on its characters and their scripts. The storyline is basic and feels unfinished but that is the entire point! It is a movie about nothing, it's simply a snippet into the lives of the characters and the timeline is all over the place, jumping backwards and forwards throughout the film. It follows two hit-men, a gangster, an underground boxer, drug dealers & a man who is contracted to get people out of the stickiest of situations, with complete calm!As 'perfect' as it is, I do have a problem with it. It's a controversial problem no doubt, and that is Bruce Willis and his hour long scene in the centre of this movie. I wouldn't say I dislike Bruce Willis as such but I do find him somewhat irritating and when I watch Pulp Fiction I do skip his scenes. In my opinion he isn't relevant and I don't feel the film would have missed his presence if he wasn't involved. This however doesn't affect my feelings for the film as a whole as the scenes with Jackson & Travolta are faultless and some of my favourite scenes in cinema. I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece.10/10",10,1,4,22 January 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A great film, for children and adults alike
","Right, this review is a review of the film. Not the book. Not how true the film is to the book. Just a review, of the film. I have read the book but it was a very long time ago and I have seen this movie so many times I have forgotten what was in the book and what wasn't. This movie, for me, is fantastic. Let me start by saying that this film, or any of the Harry Potter films, is not a children's film. Of course they appeal to children and are marketed as such but they are certainly appreciated & enjoyed by adults.The story is well known and probably doesn't need overviewing again but I will do so anyway! As a toddler, Harry Potter is left on the doorstep of his Aunties & Uncles by Dumbledore. The story then skips forward 9 years or so and Harry is being treated as a Slave almost, an outcast by his family. He sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs, is bullied by his cousin & waits on his Auntie & Uncle hand and foot. As Harry nears his 11th Birthday, post with Harrys name on it starts arriving day after day until one day it arrives in its thousands. Scared by this his Auntie & Uncle take them away to a secluded cabin for a 'holiday'. Here, Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid meets them & informs Harry that he is a wizard and is to enrol at Hogwarts School. The rest of the story pans out with Harry at School, growing up fast, making friends & even enemies.This film is pure magic. It transports to viewer to a land which is in every way possible, very believable. The sets, the acting & the effects are all first rate. The Acting in particular (on the most part) is absolutely spot on. Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Robbie Coltrane (Hargrid) & Maggie Smith (McGonagall) are all outstanding. The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) & the late Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon) also put in fantastic performances as well. My favourite character has to be Severus Snape, played by Alan Rickman. His performance as that character is faultless. My only gripe, is Harry Potter himself, played by Daniel Radcliffe. As far as acting is concerned, he is leagues behind the majority of other main actors. His acting may appear worse than it is as he is alongside some of the greatest British actors at this present time. Finding the lead actor poor should really bring the film down but with its fantastic array of other actors make up for it somewhat.Harry Potter & The Philosophers Stone is a fantastic film that appeals to all ages. The storyline is fantastic, the pace is just right & the character building is certainly a large aspect of this film and sets it up perfectly for the following movies.With the run time at just fewer than 2 and half hours it does not, for one second, feel like it is dragging its heels. The whole feature transports you to literally, another world and keeps you lost in it until the credits role. This is not my favourite of the Harry Potter franchise, it isn't even in my top 3 and that speaks volumes about my very high rating.9/10",8,0,1,16 October 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Year 2 at Hogwarts and things start to unravel at quite a pace!
","Continuing with my annual Harry Potter binge watch, it was time to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets over the weekend; one of the personal favourites out of the whole franchise. The second instalment picks up a couple of months after the first ends: it's the summer holidays prior to Harrys second year at Hogwarts and he is miserably living back at his Aunt and Uncles house. Harry is visited by a house elf named Dobby who tries to warn him that for his own safety he shouldn't return to school for the following year. The start of this movie also shows us our first glimpse of the Weasley household, Ron's Parents and Draco Malfoys father. Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts, the movie has a very similar feel to the first one; We are taken through the school year at a nice pace with plenty of things happening and several instances where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves in the wrong place at wrong time. The chemistry and on screen friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione grows during this movie and makes for a much better experience as you start to see their personalities much more. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets contains all the values you expect from a Harry Potter movie. Friendship, loyalty and courage are the base of the movies messages and it does a fantastic job of appealing to children and adults alike. Near enough all the cast return from the previous movie and we also get to see several extra characters who slot right into the movie effortlessly. The final scene of this movie is more effective and better made than the first movie and for the first time we get a glimpse of what's to come from Lord Voldermort. We also get some back story through a series of flashbacks which help us gain a better understanding of Lord voldermort and leave us with questions which will be answered in the later movies! I find it hard to write reviews for movies which are in a series as I don't like to give anything away, I won't say anymore now other than, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very well made movie with a long run time which doesn't drag at all. I personally prefer this one to the first and out of all 8 movies its certainly one of my favourites. 9/10",8,0,1,1 December 2015
Die Hard," Now this is an action flick!
","I have no reasonable explanation as to how I got to the age of 24 without seeing Die Hard. I finally watched Die Hard last Christmas and I have to say that I found it incredibly entertaining! 80's action films are usually corny and cheesy, Die Hard did have its one liners and many cliché moments but it had so much more than that. It has depth, it has characters that you care about, characters that you can connect to and genuinely tense moments that don't feel forced. Die Hard is set in a multi storey office tower, it's Christmas Eve and an office party is in full swing. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife there as the office is held hostage by terrorists looking to get rich and get out. John McClane is out of the terrorists sights as they gather the hostages and takes it upon himself to bring them down one by one, on his own. Die Hard is essentially an 80's style, adrenaline fuelled game of cat and mouse. A dozen terrorists against an off duty cop, 30 floors up in a half renovated tower block!I am not the biggest fan of Bruce Willis but I must say I did like him in Die Hard, it is by far his strongest performance and he certainly plays to his strengths. Alan Rickman gives a fantastic performance as Hans Gruber, the leader of the terrorist group. He is intense and intimidating and has a real presence when he is on screen. He isn't your stereotypical villain and I think this is what makes his performance so special.You must remember that this is an 80's action flick so expect the cliché scenarios, the one liners, the explosions and the 'as if you could do that' moments. This is probably one of my favourite 80's action films and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre (but to be honest you have probably seen it countless times already)9/10",8,2,3,22 January 2015
The Witch," This won't be to everyone's taste.
","The Witch is an indie flick, it will be enjoyed by lots of people who are aware of this and were expecting this. It's a film for lovers of real horror, not Hollywood horror, people who have a passion for art films filled with great cinematography will appreciate this movie. The stereotypical, mainstream movie goer who is hoping for jump scares and cliché horror plots will ultimately be disappointed.There is a scene within the first 15 minutes or so which is uncharacteristically brutal and gory. The rest of the movie doesn't resemble this level of horror and this scene will last in your memory long after the credits have rolled. This is a horror, there is no doubt about that, it just isn't a horror in the conventional way of the mainstream Hollywood movies.A devout Christian Family are banished from their plantation and set up home on farm on the edge of a woods, in the middle of nowhere. Before long, strange things start happening, their new-born seemingly vanishes into mid-air and their crops start to die out. We see the stress and strain take its toll as they slowly begin to turn on each other and become more and more emotionally unstable. Paranoia, hopelessness and resentment are all strong emotional factors and we truly get to see how these traumas can shake a family to the core. Their distress leaves them as a collection of individuals rather than a compact family, vulnerable to the evils within the forest.The Witch is a slow burner, a very slow burner. There were parts which I found boring and seemed to drag for no particular purpose. It is a very heavy dialogue driven movie with very little action; it focuses on the family and their relationships with each other much more than what is lurking in the forest.The acting has been praised very highly but I honestly didn't see it as that strong. I can appreciate that speaking in Old English was a challenge, especially for the child actors and this showed quite glaringly. The father of the family and the eldest daughter gave the strongest displays, both showcasing their emotions very well.The Witch has a fantastic score, the music used is perfect, capturing the old era and adding very strong tension. The music used with the breath-taking cinematography made for one very special looking movie. It is full of panoramic camera work, slow and drawn out shots which create tension and atmosphere perfectly. You never felt like there was going to be a jump scare as it is very obvious that it isn't that type of movie, but the tension is there nonetheless – it is essentially a very uneasy watch. Another strong aspect for me was the ending. I was watching the movie unravel, with underlying thoughts of how they would end this movie. I won't say too much as it's a spoiler free review but I was very, very impressed with how they did it. The very final scene was powerful and graphic, it ended in a way that felt very concluding way and ended in a climax of drama.I felt like I had an idea of what this movie was going to be like and I was completely wrong, leaving me at the time, slightly disappointed. I have since been able to appreciate The Witch for what it is and when I look back on it I can see how very impressive this movie actually is. I will be watching this again as I feel I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have upon my initial watch at the cinema.7/10",7,1,7,4 April 2016
Ice Age," A film I watched countless times, which I then re-watched years later only to find it less enjoyable than I remembered.
","Ice Age is a good movie, there is no doubt about that. As with most popular animation flicks, it appeals to all ages and has a decent enough mix of humour to keep all the family entertained. I loved Ice Age growing up and have memories of it being one of the favourite animated movies of all time. Having re-watched it at weekend, 7 or 8 years after previously viewing it, I felt a little flat. Sid seriously carries the film, many of the jokes and the majority of the dialogue comes through him. The supporting cast all do a pleasant job, Manny is entertaining and they do share some good chemistry but the film relies heavily on Sid's presence.I couldn't help but compare Ice Age to two very famous animated movies. The relationship between Sid and Manny and the unlikely relationship that they develop is reminiscent of Shrek and Donkey. The way they take care of the baby, taking him into their tribe, naming him Pinky and looking after him and getting emotionally attached as they search for his parents, reminded me too much of Monsters Inc. I don't know how I didn't see these comparisons in the past but upon recent viewing they were far too blindly obvious.With a run time of less than 1 hour 20 minutes, Ice Age really struggles with the pacing. It takes 20 or so minutes to introduce all the characters and get the plot in order then it flies through the next hour! We see scenes which could have added a little more depth - the drawings of Mammoths on the cave wall for example, this was brushed aside very quickly which I thought was a shame. I personally think Ice Age could have benefited with being 15-20 minutes longer.With the negatives that I have mentioned above being considered, I still think Ice Age is a very good film! It is funny, feel good, caring and creative. An aspect that I especially liked was that the animals didn't have a home, they weren't based anywhere, it was essentially a road trip. They moved from place to place, out of their comfort zone with only each other for support and guidance. I appreciated the message behind the story and enjoyed how the movie panned out as it progressed. The on screen relationship between Sid and Manny is very well done and Diego is a decent enough addition to the group. The story is pleasant if not a little clichéd and the comedy is a decent mix of slapstick and subtle humour. This is certainly the strongest film in the Ice Age franchise and certainly worth a watch!8/10",8,2,2,21 July 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," A Sci-Fi film with fantastic pacing and breathtaking CGI
","Tom Cruise plays Cage, a military officer who is forced to be a solider and thrown into the front line to help the human race end the alien invasion of earth. Some of the rare, more powerful aliens have abilities to reverse time and reset the day when they die, Cage develops this same power when he kills one of those aliens in battle and is burnt alive with the extra-terrestrial being. Cage now has the ability to return to the moment he awoke prior to the battle and restart the day again, offering him countless attempts to try and end the war.On paper it doesn't sound like anything ground-breaking and sounds like it would have many unoriginal Sci-Fi elements we have seen many times before. While it does have its faults it certainly excels in other aspects and delivers an extremely effective Sci-Fi/action flick.Visually this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of the CGI is perfect and you really feel immersed into the environment. The action scenes are sometimes a little shaky and up-close but the camera work is very well done that it blends in different angles to ensure you see the majority of the action clearly. There is a scene with a car and a caravan which stands out to me, look out for it! The Alien creatures also look good with really impressive movement and features. The weapons and battle gear that the soldiers wear are created with a futuristic look but not too far-fetched, they look quite realistic and believable.The pace of the movie is perfect. A problem with plenty of Sci-Fi films is when they delve into the scientific jargon, taking 30 minutes to tell the viewer irrelevant bits of information, over complicating matters. This is what usually puts me off Sci-Fi movies and the fact that Edge of Tomorrow decided to keep the science talk to a minimum was very much welcomed by myself! It keeps it to a minimum and only reveals key info, keeping the pacing of the film very well. Tom Cruise dies dozens of times in this movie and has to relive his previous hours many times. The directors did a great job in editing this so the viewer doesn't get bored, the fact Cage dies many times and relives the same hours 20+ times but doesn't feel repetitive is a brilliant achievement. The movie is just under 2 hours and I didn't get bored once.I do however have a couple of negatives with Edge of Tomorrow. There are a few plot holes which I won't go into as to not ruin any of the story. The plot holes aren't major but do seem very simple and a little baffling as to why they weren't explained. Emily Blunts gives a great performance but her character appears clichéd with cheesy one liners and predictable actions. The love element is also something that I wouldn't welcome but it is something I have come to expect and accept from Hollywood blockbusters so I can't criticise the movie for this! I feel the start has a few too many cheesy one liners and poorly delivered jokes which takes away from the seriousness of the story.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a very fun, well-choreographed, well-acted Sci Fi action flick which exceeded my expectations by quite some way. The action scenes are very well created with fantastic CGI, the action is broken up by impressive dialogue scenes that keep the viewer interested by keeping to the story and not getting carried away with unnecessary script. Great pacing, great action and a good entertaining story.8/10",8,2,6,19 February 2015
Prometheus," A mess of a movie which started strongly but quickly turned sour.
","The movie experience for me was split into two parts, beginning and end. I was entertained throughout the first half, it kept my attention and I felt immersed into the film. A sense of mystery was kept; when they arrived onto the island clues were discovered and questions were unanswered, it felt like the movie was heading into a direction that I liked. At around half way through Prometheus, the film took a massive nose dive. It spiralled out of control into a complete mess, question after question was asked and no answers were forthcoming. The action scenes were acceptable however the long, dull and confusing dialogue scenes were too often.Characters acted with complete stupidity, performing actions which left you laughing at how senseless they were. I found myself not caring for a single character in this movie which is a shame because for me that is a bare minimum that I expect from a film that delves into emotional based dialogue and characters feelings.The only positive which remained throughout was the faultless visuals. The shots on the island, along the desert landscape and deep into the dark caves were very impressive. There was a certain scene with a sandstorm, where the crew were fleeing from it and it looked especially remarkable. I was unaware that Prometheus was related to The Alien franchise when viewing this and having not seen those movies I can't comment on its resemblance to those, but from reading other people reviews I believe that it is quite insulting.Overall, I enjoyed the first half of Prometheus; It started strongly and maintained some tension. Sadly the tension lead to nothing and all the questions which are asked in the first half were far from answered in the second half. Very disappointing.4/10",4,2,6,23 July 2015
Straight Outta Compton," A beautifully crafted movie, with clear storytelling, solid acting and an unmatchable soundtrack.
","There are a ridiculous amount of 1/10 reviews for this movie. To rate a movie 1 star it must be completely horrific, with almost all aspects of the movie being poor, no redeeming positive features and an insult to the viewers. How this movie has received ratings that low, is mind- boggling. It is not a bad movie, it may not be to everyone's taste, people may have expected more, they may be disappointed with many aspects, but it simply isn't a 1/10 rated movie. I cannot comprehend how so many reviewers gave it this score.I'm a hip hop fan, the 90's – Early 2000's are the golden years for me. N.W.A were just before my time and I have never really had a solid interest in them – I knew of the members and was aware of their troubles with society and the American Government, but not to any real extent. Dr Dre and Ice Cube had huge hands on involvement in the production of Straight Outta Compton and their fingerprints show quite clearly. Much of the focus and heroism is focused around their two characters, which was to be expected in my opinion. Controversial story lines regarding Dr Dre were kept out which isn't surprising. It could have been seen as brave for it to have been included but you can hardly have any real shock that these scenarios weren't added into to the movie. Straight Outta Compton has a real epic movie feel about it, it's a huge production. It's vibrant and beautifully shot, the use of the music scenes is done to perfection, whether it's the studio sessions or the portrayal of the concerts. No expense is spared and this aspect of the movie cannot be faulted in the slightest. Casting was solid, with a good balance of 'lookalikes' and acting quality. Ice Cubes son, who played his father in this movie did a very good job; especially when you consider it was his acting debut. It was a risk to use him in a film of this size but it definitely paid off which was nice to see. All other lead actors did a solid job, although sometimes the emotional scenes felt uncomfortable and unconvincing which was disappointing. As you would expect the soundtrack was incredible! It's a shame that I didn't view this movie in the cinema to get the full experience. The concert scenes are especially great with many of their best known tracks being redone. Some other tracks from that era get cameos, such as Tupac plus Dre & Snoop tracks – offering some more nostalgic affection.The portrayal of Eazy-E has been met with a lot of criticism from fans; people believe they exposed him as being too soft and the only band member who was ever in the wrong. As I previously said, my prior knowledge of N.W.A was minimal so I couldn't make any comparisons off of my own opinion of him as I didn't really have one! Eazy-E obviously wasn't around to tell his side of the story and we are forced to hear it from Dre and Ice Cube, whether that is extremely biased or fair, I have no idea.It's a long film with a run time of over 2 and a half hours but the pacing is spot on and I didn't find it dragging whatsoever. It starts off at a blistering pace; it then slows down to introduce the band members one by one. There are parts which I felt were rushed and didn't get the attention/screen time they deserved but since watching this movie I have read that it had an initial run time of 3 and a half hours. It was required to be cut down significantly, over an hour of footage was removed which could explain why some scenes felt rushed and cut short. It has a real hood feel to it, set over the late 80's – early 90's, sets and styles are perfect to this time and you feel transported to this era effortlessly.Also, people overly complaining about the final scenes when the credits role are embarrassing themselves. Criticising Dre for advertising his Beats headphones and describing the whole movie as 'an advertising campaign'? The credit scene was expertly done in my opinion, it shows a time reel of old clips and photos, followed by up to date clips showing us what the band members do in the current day. This includes Ice Cubes acting, Dr Dre's production and business ventures and it is ended with a fitting tribute to Eazy E. People simply love to complain about absolutely everything, picking holes in whatever they can.Straight Outta Compton is a powerful movie, a biopic of 5 young black males rising up in an era of racism, police brutality and society's general unacceptance of aggressive, gangster hip-hop music. It's of course glorified, and negative aspects are left out of the movie in order to create a more rags to riches, underdog story, making the viewer see these men more positively. But it is a very, very well made movie which is getting far too much stick from 100's of reviewers on the internet. The marketing campaign was huge and it was lapped up in the masses by a worldwide fan base. For example, my girlfriend watched this movie with me, she has next to no interest in 'old school hip-hop', yet she thoroughly enjoyed Straight Outta Compton appreciating the film for its fantastic features.9/10",9,2,26,8 March 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the greatest thrillers of all time
","I read somewhere that Anthony Hopkins has little more than 15 minutes actual screen time in a feature that runs just under two hours. For me, whenever Silence of the Lambs is brought up I instantly think of Dr Hannibal Lecter. This speaks volumes for how much of a powerful and memorable performance he gives as one of the best villains of all time, despite only featuring for around an eighth of the movie. His performance/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest. But on the other hand he is also intriguing, disturbing and very uneasy to watch. The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!Jodie Foster gives an incredible performance and this is easily my favourite out of all the roles she has played. She plays a young, trainee detective who is extremely vulnerable and is struggling to deal with the demons of her childhood. Buffalo Bill is a serial killer on the loose and the FBI are running out of time to catch him, Jodie Foster's character is sent to visit Hannibal Lecter to do research into the mind of a serial killer. She visits him in his confined mental institute where he is serving his life sentence. Hannibal Lecter starts to mentor Jodie Foster and the few scenes we get of these two, either on opposite side of reinforced glass are some of the most intense but somehow touching scenes I have experienced.The plot is perfect and stays very grounded, it knows what it wants to be and it stays true to itself throughout. It doesn't get over complicated or take any unnecessary risks, it simply does what it needs to and the actors do the rest with their fantastic characters and script. There is one scene in particular that stays in my mind when thinking of this movie and It is very tense and disturbing but shows us just what we need to see, it isn't overly gory for the sake of it. This is what Silence of the Lambs does so well, it is very graphic yet it doesn't make you want to look away in disgust, instead it connects with you very well.Silence of the Lambs has it all, it has a solid plot, characters with depth and development, incredible acting, tension and a great script. All it needs in my opinion is some more screen time for Hannibal Lector as he really is a faultless villain but then on the other hand the way he is used is subtle and could well be more effective because of this. Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers I have seen and it deserves all the awards and accolades it has received over the past 24 years.9/10",9,1,1,9 February 2015
Toy Story 3," A fitting end to an incredible trilogy, certainly worth the wait!
","Toy Story 3 starts as Andy is packing up his things, cleaning out his bedroom as he prepares to leave home for College. He is separating his belongings into piles of store in the loft, send to local play centre and take to college with him. Toys are fed up and feeling unloved as they aren't played with anymore and are becoming increasingly worried that they are going to be donated. Andy can't bring himself to throw away his childhood toys and opts to put them into the loft for safe keeping. The bag of toys get mixed up with some other bags and they end up being re-homed at the local child day centre. The toys are unaware of the mix up and they are under the impression that Andy doesn't care for them anymore. The vast majority of the story is set in the Sunny Side day centre with many news toys being introduced.The pressure to create Toy Story 3 and ensure that it lives up to its incredibly high reputation and previous two films is massive but Pixar do not let us down. The imagination that the creators have is second to none; the work that they have created is nothing short of pure genius. The message behind the animation is spot on, this is what makes many Pixar stories appeal to adults as well as children. It has humour, heart, depth, fantastic effects and of course the message of friendship and loyalty. Toy Story 3 is the biggest one yet; it boasts fantastic effects and takes the toys adventures onto a massive scale. It does push its limits but it doesn't for one second forget the basics, it keeps true to the previous two movies and that is what makes Toy Story 3 a massive success.If I was to be very picky and try and fault Toy Story 3 it would be the Ken and Barbie storyline, I don't think it is necessary. I understand why they did it and I don't fault them for it but in my eyes I didn't enjoy that so much. The last fifteen minutes are faultless, it is a movie making masterpiece and I wouldn't change a single aspect of it, it's the most fitting end to any movie trilogy I have ever seen. Nothing else needs to be said, it is as magic, touching and fun as the previous movies and is on par with the best animated movies ever made.9/10",9,0,1,3 February 2015
Lucy," Not a bad idea but poorly executed with hollow characters
","What would happen if we were able to use 100% of our full brains capacity? Well according to the movie Lucy we would turn into some sort of Jedi Master who can read minds, control objects and human bodies with the mind, suffer bullet wounds with no pain or weakness and eventually turn ourselves into some sort of spiritual being. We would lose all emotion and empathy; we would walk around aimlessly in a robotic, mindless manner and only be able to communicate using awful punchlines and mundane one word answers.Lucy is a student living in Taiwan, she meets a man in a nightclub, dates for a week and is then tricked into delivering a mystery briefcase to a man named Mr Jang. Inside the briefcase is a new illegal drug that they want to get into the big European countries, the drug is designed to enhance the users brain capacity in order to develop mental and physical strength. Lucy and several others are then knocked out and operated on, a pouch of this new drug is then inserted into their lower stomach in order for them to transport it via aeroplane. Then came the point in which the story took a massive nose dive into a complete train wreck of a movie. When Lucy awakes she is informed of what is happening and is transported somewhere unnamed where she is beat up and repeatedly kicked in the stomach. This results in the pouch splitting and the drug being released into Lucy's bloodstream. What follows can only be described as one of the most ridiculous concepts and poorly executed stories I have seen. Lucy begins crawling on the walls and ceiling, has inhuman strengths and can read minds. As her brain capacity grows so do her powers.Lucy isn't a superhero movie and it isn't trying to be but it feels like one but without a hero, its scientific side which it drums down the viewer's throat seems laughable and embarrassingly corny. It is impossible to connect with any of the characters, Scarlett Johansson starts well but then once the drugs kick in she turns into a robotic, dull, mundane shell of a human that merely walks around giving one word answers and really cheesy poorly delivered one liners. Morgan Freeman has wasted his time and effort on this movie, he has a backseat role and does his usual Morgan role of talking slowly and intelligently, which suits me fine if the movie is even half decent. The whole movie just feels completely pointless, there is no character depth or development, you care for neither and have no back story to any of them. There are some huge plot holes which it seems the creators literally could not be bothered to fill and the meaning behind the story which they are trying to deliver is pointless and pretentious. The movie has no aim, the ending is awful and even as you are approaching the end of the movie nothing is building, there is no suspense or interest in what is going to happen.To summarise, Lucy starts quite well, it's mysterious and looks very good visually. But the more you watch the worse it gets, things keep happening and when they do you question it all. It all feels pointless and half finished. I don't think the idea is actually that bad and I think they really could have created something decent with it but it was far too poorly executed.First Half = OK. Second Half = Appalling.The only credible factor about the second half of this movie is the special effects. Some of the effects look fantastic, a lot of time and effort went into them and it shows. That is honestly the only positive I have for this movie, well that and the short run time of 80 minutes.3/10",3,2,6,11 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I enjoyed it!
","I am not what you would call 'the biggest Star Wars fan', the original trilogy certainly holds some nostalgia for me as I do remember watching them countless times as a child, the second trilogy I had little time for and only recently watched them all for the first time. I was however very excited to watch Star Wars – The Force Awakens, I bought into the hype and went to view it within a couple of days of it being released. Overall I really enjoyed the latest instalment, I can see and appreciate where the negative reviews are coming from and I believe that if I was a hard-core Star Wars fan then I may be inclined to agree with them. But for me and for my expectations going into this, and also from what I was hoping for from this movie I was very pleasantly surprised!When the titles rolled I was thrown back to being a child, the same excitement I remember getting back then was very much replicated 20+ years later. The opening scenes start at blistering pace, throwing many characters together in one scene. From then on other characters old and new, are introduced very well and after that the pace picks up again and doesn't slow until the final scene! One of things I liked most was the pacing – some scenes did feel a little rushed but overall the movie progressed well and kept my attention from the start to end. The two new main characters Finn and Rey are presented very early on in the movie and their development and chemistry is worked on very closely, making you feel a connection to them. Kylo Ren is an interesting character, offering something different to the original trilogy, I thought the role that was given to him was perfect for the latest movies although I have seen many reviews from people who would disagree with this.The CGI, sets, costumes, respect shown to the old Star Wars world some 30 years ago and acting styles are all true and represent the Star Wars legacy correctly. It is refreshing to see in modern cinema, directors using make up and suits to portray their characters rather than copious amounts of CGI, this is something that was well documented on the lead up to this film's release and it was nice to see that they had stuck to their word.Star Wars – The Force Awakens has been described by many as a money spinner, a simple remake of the old movies with a similar plot, too many similarities and rip offs, no originality and a borderline carbon copy of characters, scenarios and plot points. I honestly cannot argue with these points but that honestly didn't stop me enjoying this movie, I went into the cinema and was thoroughly entertained for over two hours, fully immersed into the environment reliving moments from one of my most loved movies as a child. The similarities may stop this movie being seen as a classic by hardcore Star Wars fans but to me I can see past that and if I was to hold the movie as a standalone film then I would find it very hard to criticise. These negatives are glaringly obvious and while I can't argue with them, I still thoroughly enjoyed Star Wars – The Force Awakens.The comedy oneliners are over used and often feel forced and unnecessary. I was expecting some comic lines but not to the extent that they were used here, it seems that at any opportunity possible they were thrown in there, often resulting it the seriousness of situations being deflated due to this. While Finn (John Boyega) gave an incredibly convincing performance I did feel that Rey (Daisy Ridley) was far from this. Her acting was awkward and wooden but was saved on several occasions by the strength of her co-actors, I hope she can improve for the next instalment as watching her was laughable at times. The movie ended, setting up the plot nicely for the next instalment, I won't give away how and what happened to do this but I do feel they ended it well. The final scene did feel a little rushed and almost had an anti-climax but I feel it was necessary for the second film to flow and to pick up with some pace, having the plot of the first movie spill over into the second film would have ruined the franchises perfect pacing. Overall I cannot argue with many of the critics and I can see a lot of their points as valid but I left the cinema feeling very entertained and satisfied with the latest Star Wars film. Could this be down to my low expectations following the horrific experiences of Episodes 1 2 and 3 or was it simply due to this movie staying true to its nostalgic roots? View this movie on its own merits and get lost in the Star Wars universe, it is one hell of a ride!9/10 - As a stand alone movie it was very impressive.",9,5,27,31 December 2015
The Purge," Bad.
","The Purge has an original concept & had a good marketing campaign (everywhere you looked you saw posters & advertisements). Horror/Thriller films are one of my preferred movie genres, even when horror films have big plot-holes, stupid characters & sometimes wobbly story lines, I still, more often than not, find something to enjoy and take something away from the movie experience. The Purge however was bad from start to finish; I am genuinely struggling to think of one single positive. 1) I was expecting a horror. A horror is designed to scare you, to give you an anxious/nervous feeling when watching or at the very least, make you jump. Did the Purge do any of those 3? No.2) The characters. More often than not in horror films, there are shallow, idiotic characters that do silly things and make you wonder why they did things they did. In the Purge is this the case? Absolutely. The most irritating, annoying, dumbest characters, acted horrifically by the actors (bar one or two). The son is one of the dumbest characters I have ever had the displeasure of watching. He shuts down the security system to let a homeless man into his home, without telling or asking his parents and without a respectable motive to do so. I do like Ethan Hawke and I do believe that he is not all that bad an actor, but in the Purge he offers very little.3) The storyline. Initially it was an interesting concept, original and never been done before, 20 minutes in, plot-holes were humongous. The story was boring, incredibly predictable and overly annoying. The Purge may have an interested concept but they should have at least built a decent story to go with it.4) The 'Bad Guys'. Scary, mysterious, downright twisted, a psychopath with a motive. Does the purge have any of these as its villains? No. The masks of the villains are removed within 30 seconds of them being introduced which killed all suspense and mystery (see 'The Strangers' for how to do it right). 5) Ending. Many horror flicks have controversial endings, opinions are often divided and I can appreciate the difficulty in choosing a way to end a film of this genre. The ending of the Purge, in my opinion, is abysmal. Some people live, some people die, you don't care at all for the people who live and you certainly don't care for those who die. It feels as if they never had any ending thought out and just gave up. It is different than many other endings, but that is not a good thing. Not in the slightest.The Purge is not suspenseful, it is not creepy, it is not jumpy and it is certainly not Scary. The characters are awful, acting is suspect, ending is dire & the story line is boring & unrealistic. The only thing stopping me giving this a 1/10 is the 85 minute run time. If that is the only positive you can give a movie then it has serious problems.Avoid. 2/10",2,1,1,10 September 2014
Deadpool," Deadpool is a violent comic-book flick with bad language, nudity and plenty of gore to boot.
","Comic-book/Superhero movies are not my ideal genre, I rarely watch them and baring the odd exception I find them relatively uninteresting. I had heard positive things about Deadpool, I was told it wasn't your average superhero movie and despite my reservations I decided to give it a go. Starting with a beautifully constructed intro scene, it was clear from the get-go that this wasn't what I have come to expect from previous superhero movies. It was violent with graphic gore, had bad language and had a unique spoof comic-book style; from the first few minutes I was laughing at the one-liners and enjoying the violence, I was hooked.I was expecting the humour to be forced and awkward, the trailers made it look this way and I honestly didn't expect to find it all that funny. At the start it did feel slightly off to me but once I adjusted to the style everything clicked and it worked, completely. From the timing of the one-liners to the witty narrative, it's simply a well humoured movie which had me laughing to myself on many occasions. Some jokes did miss the target with me but this is to be expected and isn't something which I can put the movie down for. The choreography in the action scenes along with the graphic violence was very refreshing and when it was mixed with a little dry humour it made for some impressive sequences. There's some slapstick in the action scenes with immature humour which isn't really to my taste. Thankfully this was relatively minimal and was balanced out enough to not bog the movie down. Whilst the movie is violent and graphic, it's not quite at Game of Thrones levels of gore so don't let this put you off too much if you're one of the squeamish types.The run-time is perfect, at 105 minutes the movie doesn't drag for a single second, and other directors should take note that not all anticipated, big screen movies need to be 2+ hours just for the sake of it. We are thrown into the action straight away before being shown detailed backstory through the use of flashbacks. This happens throughout the movie as the story unravels revealing how Deadpool was created. It's very well done and although a little predictable it doesn't give everything away too early and I was kept intrigued, wanting to know what was going to happen next.Despite being completely ridiculous and not taking itself seriously, Deadpool manages to achieve a sense of emotion; the love relationship is kept sharp and works with the plot. Love stories are a given in practically every single genre of movie nowadays, even more so in superhero flicks and Deadpool does a good enough job of not making it too overpowering or distracting. Paying homage to other comic books and other movies is a nice touch and although some I could appreciate I feel that many went over my head due to my lack of superhero/comic book knowledge or interest. The score was fantastic with a fantastic soundtrack, this is another thing which worked perfectly with the movie and was one of the things I really appreciated. Getting the music right is a tough ask for movies and an even tougher one for a movie like this. It has a great mix of music which all compliments the movie well.Overall my expectations for Deadpool were very low due to my own personal movie taste and also the trailers which didn't look overly appealing. As the credits rolled to yet another strangely perfect song from the fantastic soundtrack, I was filled with a huge sense of enjoyment. I had just watched a movie which I thoroughly enjoyed even though all the signs were pointing towards it being a film I was going to dislike. Its witty, violent, cool, excellently choreographed and downright adrenaline pumped. Go see it as soon as you can and don't forget the popcorn.8/10",9,5,13,17 October 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.
","It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. First off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.It is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!Kingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!8/10P.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.",8,12,21,11 February 2016
Minions," Strictly for Kids.
","Minions is without a doubt a money spinner which didn't consider the depth and options that would be available when making a full length feature movie with such a limited script. The Minions were my favourite aspect of Despicable Me, they were funny and fresh, bringing fantastic support to the lead character Gru. This is where they are best, being offered in small portions, supporting other characters. Introducing them to the big screen, alone, without a leader was always going to be difficult to pull off and personally I feel like they failed. They benefited so much as supporting characters that putting them centre stage simply didn't work.The greatest characteristic of animated movies is how they appeal to all audiences equally. Minions is very much a kid orientated film. It has little appeal to adults and it simply doesn't try to target that market. It is extremely more childish than the Despicable Me films which is to be expected I suppose but I will still disappointed nevertheless.All the funny bits are in the trailers, which was massively disappointing. Gone are the days when you can watch a trailer to give you a sneak peak of a movie, still leaving you with some surprises when you view the movie. 3-4 minute trailers are ruining the film experience and I tend to stay clear of viewing them.Overall Minions lacked any real depth and having 90% of the movie script-less hurt it badly. The story follows the minions on their search to find a leader but ironically, not having a leader is what made this movie fall short.A generous 3/10.",3,3,10,21 August 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max: Fury Road is an adrenaline fuelled, nonstop action packed, visual masterpiece.
","This film should certainly be viewed on the big screen; this is where you will received the ultimate experience. I viewed it in 2D but it was very obvious that many scenes were made with 3D in mind and I feel alittle disappointed that I didn't get that experience.The storyline is minimal and everything you need to know is explained briefly during the opening scenes. There are too many Hollywood films these days which try and cram back stories, subplots, character development and unnecessary dialogue into action movies, making them feel cramped and boring with three hour run times. Mad Max knows what it is, it's an Action Movie and it's as simple as that. It doesn't feel the need to complicate things and kept to a reasonable run time of under two hours, which is what I liked about it. The only thing worth talking about here is the action. It is so well done and so refreshing to see. You get to see full panoramic shots of the action and the use of 'shaky cam' is kept to a minimum. The camera work is breath-taking and it is used in such a way that you feel emerged in the action without having the 'headache/nausea feeling that so many action heavy films give you. I truly enjoyed the creativity of the entire movie, the costumes, vehicles and weapons were all very well done. The action was frantic and felt panicky at certain times, some scenes felt very anxious and the edgy feeling was quite alarming as I didn't expect it.The movie is split into parts making it easily digestible and keeps it flowing smoothly. It will have 15-20 minutes of intense, breath-taking action then slow it down for 10 minutes with some dialogue. This suits the movie well, especially considering that the scenes breaking up the action are kept basic and do not delve into back stories etc.I do have a few negatives but they are hard to comment on without giving anything away. All I will say is that some of the non-action scenes feel a little forced and clichÃ©d and what should have been one of the most important scenes in the movie was cut out and left to the imagination as to what happened!Overall Mad Max is an adrenaline ride from start to finish and needs to be taken for what it is. It doesn't try to have depth and I respect that. Viewing it in the cinema will certainly enhance your experience more so that other films. Go and watch it!8/10",9,2,15,8 June 2015
Furious 7," Adrenaline fuelled roller-coaster of a movie with an emotional element, which needs to be viewed without any logical thinking or hopes of realistic storytelling.
","Furious 7, the seventh instalment in the Fast and Furious franchise is bigger than ever; The action scenes are longer, more spectacular, more ridiculous and more adrenaline pumped! It's best for you if you just ignore the plot of the movie and enjoy it for what it is; a fun popcorn flick with some brilliant throwbacks to 90's action movies with its cheesy dialogue and clichÃ© moments.The action: No matter how you look at it or what overall opinion you have of this movie or indeed the franchise as a whole; the action is breathtakingly good. Of course many scenes are clichÃ© Hollywood with choppy editing and shaky cam, especially is the one on one combat scenes but that is something you should expect when it's a cast of Hollywood actors and not martial arts experts. The car scenes are superb, it has a real heist movie theme and the scene in the base when they drive out of the plane and the tower block scene is ludicrous, practically hilarious but very well made all the same. Instalment upon instalment these movies get bigger and bigger and if you were to rate Furious 7 on the execution and creativity of the action sequences alone, It would be a very strong movie.The Plot: The plot really is very week and all over the place, it lacks any real cohesion by being far too jumbled, contradicting and fails to maintain basic common sense. Jason Statham plays Shaw, brother to the villain who is defeated in the previous movie, who is after revenge against Vin Diesel and his crew. However Vin Diesel, in order to try and get to Statham first, works with the government to try and obtain a worldwide super tracker which is a very intelligent item which hacks into CCTV all around the world and can locate somebody in a matter of minutes. So while they are chasing the people who have stolen this piece of kit, Statham is also chasing them. No matter where Vin Diesel & co go in the world, Statham crops up trying to kill them while they run away again. Essentially they are chasing a team which have this tracking kit, in order to use the tracker to locate the man who is constantly following them. Yeah, as I said, the plot is stupid and offensive to anybody who has an IQ of 25 and upwards, so it is much better if you simply switch off from that and enjoy the action. It's almost as if they created the action scenes they wanted to use and then struggled to link them together so they came up with pointless reasons for the actors to go to completely different locations for the action sequence to play out, and then for them to move on completely from that location to somewhere new for another blockbuster action scene. Now, I'm not naÃ¯ve, I didn't go into Furious 7 expecting the Shawshank Redemption in terms of story-telling, but at least try and come up with a cohesive , interconnected storyline that we can get immersed into in-between all the action.Paul Walker: Having watched all 6 previous movies, I was sad to hear of the sudden death of Paul Walker part way through the filming of Furious 7. I was intrigued to know how they would complete the filming of the movie after they announced, against a lot of speculation, that they wouldn't scrap what they had already filmed and they would be completing it. I take my hat off to the whole team and director for what they did, it must have been such a hard task to do it so convincingly but they worked with what they had and pulled it off as best as they could. They apparently used body doubles, CGI and Paul Walkers brother for the scenes filmed after his death. I noticed the body double scenes during the fighting scenes, a couple of one on one scenes we don't see Paul Walkers face, just strategically timed shots of the back/side of his head and lots of body shots. The CGI is a little awkward to see and I can imagine it was upsetting for his family and friends, it isn't used too heavily and looks like a video game character but for certain scenes we really needed to see his face. You can tell the storyline is a little jumbled up due to his death but the final moments were emotional and gave a fitting, heartfelt goodbye to Paul Walker, it wasn't too sloppy and kept within the feel of the franchise. It was in context of the movie but was also felt on a personal level from Vin Diesel.A big gripe for me was the lack of involvement from the Rock. Whether it was his choice to have a small part due to other commitments or the creators deciding to give him less screen time, whichever it was I thought it was a shame that he didn't have a bigger part. Some of the best scenes come from his presence being in them and to not have him for the majority of this movie was a negative move.Overall, Fast 7 is a decent action movie with some simply incredible scenes. It's a popcorn flick, and that's it. The plot is a mess and the storytelling is probably the worst of the lot (beside Tokyo Drift, obviously). The send-off to Paul Walker was emotional and fitting, adding something special to the seventh instalment of this franchise. There will be an eight movie, which has been confirmed, I also wouldn't be surprised if there was a ninth, tenth and so on. It's a cash cow, it's not everybody's cup of tea and it's far from perfect but it did entertain me, and that's what it tries to do.7/10",7,1,18,7 June 2016
