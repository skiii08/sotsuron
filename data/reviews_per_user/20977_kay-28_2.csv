Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Loved it!
","I always know if a critic doesn't like something I most likely will completely enjoy it. I've seen the originals dozens of times and to me the acting is bad and I, in one way shape or form, get a strong 'human element' from them, so when I saw this new one(two times) and found the acting okay and the human element just how I like it, I loved it! These are great far-from-anything-earthlike sci-fi movies, that's all I want from them. I think these new three will stand by themselves as great movies judging from this wonderful start!",9,0,0,23 May 1999
The Matrix," Beautiful movie
","This was a really good movie, altogether I found it very interesting. We need more high budget, fancy, yet thought provoking movies,like this one. If you liked this try to find Dark City, also great.",10,0,1,5 May 1999
