The King's Speech," how life is affected by the little things
","In the film that never got the credit it deserved, and Colin
Firth's absolute best performance, King George Vl of England battles speech impediment with the help of the stubborn but understanding speech therapist Lionel Logue.
In perfect symbiosis, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush manage to tell the eye watering story of how life is affected by the little things. One of the best movies I have ever seen.",8,0,0,17 April 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning

Come and See," the most brutal movie in the world's film history

The Great Dictator," great movie

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.
","Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Both a comedy and a war drama, it manages to be compelling, but funny. Tense, but witty. And above all, it relentlessly parodies human's most disgusting and vile qualities. It's much more than just a war movie - it's a both hilarious and extremely depressing character study of mankind.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe
","Easily one of the best entries in the Marvel cinematic universe, The Winter Soldier is as much of a top-notch action thriller as it is a superhero blockbuster. It has a compelling premise, engaging story, and exciting action set pieces. If there are any real complaints, it's with the climax, where the action begins to go a little too over-the-top.
However, even at its most bombastic, the Russo's always manage to keep the action in service to the story.",8,1,1,28 April 2020

The lines are great. They explain a lot of philosophical ideas behind the scenes without humor. I come to bargain !!!",8,1,1,18 March 2020

Batman Begins," love this movie
","Nolan's film taps into the psychological and scientific aspects of Batman and the world that surrounds him. The film gives us a realistic understanding of why a billionaire dresses up as a bat and fights criminals. Bale's performance as both Bruce and Batman is probably one of the best, while the performances by
Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are perfect for the world Nolan has created. The film makes you see comic book characters and films in a different way and makes it seem like all this can actually exist in our world.",8,0,0,23 April 2020

The appearance of many characters is dazzling, but they are still distinct. Jarvis and Vison are amazingly fit, and there are not many twins.
