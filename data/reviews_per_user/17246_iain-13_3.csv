Come and See," A Movie About Germans In Russia
","I saw 'Come And See' when I was very sick in London. It made me feel somewhat worse. Few films have the power to do this. Come And See does. Simply put, if you want to see what it was like when the Germans invaded Russia in WW Two then see this film. All the barbarism you would imagine in such a conflict is calmly and objectively portrayed. Most importantly the film itself makes no judgment, it is merely the teller of a sad story. If all films had such control and strength it would be worthwhile going to the cinema. One of the best films I have ever seen.",Null,3,6,29 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People dont understand the pleasure.
","Choose good films, drama with right angle turns, comedy with tears at the end, war that shows war. Choose acting that burns a character into your memory, lighting that hypnotises, camera work that puts you in the driver seat. Choose plots that a writer can be proud of. I didn't, I chose not too, and the reason? Who needs reasons when you've got STAR WARS.",Null,0,0,29 July 1999
Platoon," A Terrible Episode In US History.
","Looking back on 'Platoon' Americans feel a collective darkness. Despite mass protests across the nation against films as dire and unoriginal as this, those in control went ahead and subjected countless thousands of young men (and a few unfortunate woman who were dragged along) to an inhumane experience of almost two hours excruciating tedium. All moral obligations were abandoned in the lust for cinematic recognition, any concern for the 'post terrible film stress disorder' was dismissed as quackery. Many of the young actors involved still suffer appalling casting to this day.After 'Platoon' America was never the same again. In the realms of plagerized, phony, xenophobic screenwriting the first, second and last casualty is always the paying cinema goer.",Null,0,0,29 July 1999
