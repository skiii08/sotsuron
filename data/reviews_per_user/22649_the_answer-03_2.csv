Conquest 1453," Nicely executed film considering it's budget.
","First of all, thanks for making such efforts and producing a film like this. Considering and comparing with some other historical war movies such as Troy, Braveheart etc. this movie has been nicely executed taking into account it's budget. And I barely can understand how some people commented 'I'm ashamed of being Turk, etc..' Sometimes people get lost by the fame of a few things like there are no famous actors, there is not a 150 mil. budget, this is not a Hollywood production. If people don't support these kind of productions, then unfortunately we will never see 150 mil. budget films either. Please make your critics in a constructive way. However, film was missing a few small details which would make it prettier and higher quality in my opinion such as: - Italians and Greeks should have spoken their native languages with Turkish subtitles. You don't need actors to be able to speak if you don't have such budget but you could have a translator in both languages and write the script that way. - Film is about the conquest, key part of this was walking ships from land and bringing them to the weakest point of Constantine. It should have been given more detailed way how Faith came to this solution and instead of just showing middle part of walking ships, they should have made a speech that Faith brings out his thoughts of doing it. In addition to that, the inscription(tablet) which was written by Hz.Eyup should have been shown with it's glyphs on it. For an ordinary person, it only looked like a stone that they dug out. - Finally, Faith was pretty obvious in his pictures that he had a 'big' nose, main actor was OK as acting but in my opinion he should have been a more suitable look to the real one. Moreover, in history Faith was also at war fighting with his soldiers but in movie he was only at background watching and thinking.All in all, once again I hope that we will have more and better films like this one. War scenes were very real, at least production did a good job on that action scenes.",9,15,42,25 February 2012
Man of Steel," Big time fail
","Another action-money spreading big time failure film. Total waste of time, worse superman film ever. Moreover I think it would be a way much better film with those actors if they went to Las Vegas for a geek weekend. To have all those good actors and make such bad scenario is unacceptable in my opinion. Film was boring from the the beginning till the end. I just waited for something to happen, to thrill etc. Nothing. With all due respect, it was one of those films that made me feel guilty for not leaving instead watching till the end. I relied on high votes on IMDb.com and wished that I stopped watching at first 10 minutes. Long and boring action scenes, boring scenario and all..",1,7,14,21 July 2013
