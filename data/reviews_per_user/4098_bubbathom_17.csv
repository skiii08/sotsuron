The Blair Witch Project," It was OK, kind of boring.
","This movie was OK, but the thing that bugs me is it's all about anticipation. Everybody's anticipating the moment where the witch reveals itself or something like that. Not that I have a problem with that, it's just that it's really anticipating the very ending, or when the witch takes Josh. The thing is, that stuff doesn't happen 'til about the very end of the film. This kind of bothers me, because the rest of the movie is kind of boring. Besides when they find the weird signs and stuff, there isn't much to this film besides the end. And by the way, please don't say this is actually 'real footage', because it's not. If it were, they wouldn't present it to America in movie fashion. It was OK, 6/10",6,0,1,5 July 2008
The Longest Yard," Very good. Not as good as the original, but still funny
","I thought this movie was hilarious. When I first heard of it, I was kind of skeptical with all of the weird actors. With Sandler being Crewe, and Nelly, Chris Rock, Goldberg, and Steve Austin were all big characters. But, they all did a great job and I thought this film succeeded expectations. It's a good movie to watch every once in a while. They took a few ideas from the original, but then improvised the rest of the movie. Even though it had some odd actors, they did good. Not many remakes are like this. But then again, most remakes are more like the originalVery good. 7/10.",7,0,2,5 July 2008
Fight Club," This movie is amazing!
","Fight Club is just a great movie. It is a mix of a lot of different thing: it's dark and disturbing, but also funny, clever, and cunning. It is thought provoking and makes you really think about what you consume and how much of it you actually need. It challenges the viewer to think throughout the whole movie, and it sends a great message.Edward Norton plays role as a corporate-working average guy who really needs someone to change his life. Then along comes Marla and Tyler Durden. It really is amazing to see how much Norton changes throughout the movie. The end will leave you stoked and maybe even confused, it also left me wanting to watch it over and over and over again. It is truly a great ending. The actor's all do a wonderful job, especially Norton and Pitt.What else is there to write that all the other viewers haven't already? If you haven't seen Fight Club yet, go see it for god's sake! Amazing, Classic-10/10.",10,1,3,16 December 2008
Superbad," Wild, uproarious, yet true comedy
","I expected Superbad to be a movie like Date Movie, so going into it, the only thing I looked forward to was Jonah Hill. Wow, it was soo much better than I expected. The actors all did a wonderful job outlining what a teen guy/girl acts like-Wanting sex,drugs,alcohol,etc. This is one of those films thats basically for high schoolers and their dreams of wild parties with drunk girls. This was undoubtedly the funniest film of 2007, nothing comes close. There were not many good films in 2007, but this was one of the very few that was wonderful. I give it a 9/10, just missed the last one because there wasn't much of a good plot.",9,0,2,2 January 2008
Cloverfield," Awesome.
","Most people will tell you Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan. However, it's so much more than that. I would describe Cloverfield as a drama rather than a monster movie, but it really combines all these elements: Drama, romance, action, mystery, horror, and sci-fi.When first hearing that Cloverfield is about a monster that attacks Manhattan, it would be likely to think of the movie as unoriginal, but it is the exact opposite of that. Cloverfield is directed using the hand-held(shaky camera) technique, which is a gutsy move, as not everyone likes the technique. The film is portrayed as if it's raw footage of the monster attacking Manhattan, found by the US government after the attack. Many people complain about the filming, and say that it's like an amateur filmed it, but I personally loved the cinematography. The hand-held technique also gives the movie a really mysterious vibe, because you only know as much as an average person would. There's no scientist there to explain the monsters origins and how to destroy it, which is really annoying to me in most monster movies.Another original thing about Cloverfield is the viral marketing. Viral marketing is advertising a product through some form of media(in Cloverfield's case, the internet) indirectly and relies on word of mouth. Some of the Cloverfield viral websites: Slusho, Tagruato, 1-18- 08, and many others. Following the viral campaign was lots of fun, and added a lot to the experience of the movie.People complain about the camera technique, the mystery, the plot, basically everything I like about the movie. I guess it's just a difference in opinion, and it can't be proved one way or another.Overall, I thought Cloverfield was great. It's one of my favorite movies of all time. 10/10.",10,2,4,7 March 2010
Watchmen," Purely Amazing
","I went into Watchmen with seemingly unreachable expectations, but miraculously they were met. Snyder somehow basically transformed, nearly word for word, the book into a movie.The visual effects were spectacular. To those who said the violence was over-the-top, I agree, but I think it just added to the incredible effect of the movie. One thing I didn't like was the sound effects during the fight scenes. It sounded like martial arts, but that's just quibbling, so I'll just stop right there.The actors were awesome, Especially Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffery Dean Morgan. The atmosphere was very well done, giving an excellent 80's feel with the music and such. The tone set in the first sequence was held throughout the entire movie, which is great.One thing though that scares me is that those who haven't read the book may be very confused. I went with my friend who had not read the book besides like 10 pages before we left, and he said he was pretty confused for some of the time. But this is better than having it made mostly for those who haven't read the book. I just hope the people who haven't read the book won't dislike it because they were confused most the time.Many people complained about the ending, and personally I like the ending in the book better, but it was a good move to change it because the audience that hadn't read the book would've been totally confused if the original ending were chosen. I showed my friend the ending and he said he would have been laughing if the original ending were in there instead. Plus, the effect is basically the same, so it doesn't REALLY matter.So, this has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen, especially being adapted from such a great and complex book. I respect Zack Snyder much more now, he has proved that he can direct great movies. Watchmen earns a perfect 10 for me, a wonderful movie!",10,2,6,6 March 2009
City of God," Amazing and terrifyingly realistic movie.
","I was going through the top 250 seeing which movies looked good and I came upon City of God. I was kind of skeptical at first because of the subtitles, but I got it anyways. The movie is very unique, taking the whole gangster concept to a different level, using young men who basically feel they have no choice but to become hoodlums and deal drugs. Rocket, the main character, is very likable and funny at times. I felt for the characters and thought the actors were very, very good. As I said, it seems so real, because if I'm not mistaken, it's based on a true story. It's kind of disturbing sometimes to see young kids dealing drugs, smoking, and shooting other people(or getting shot at), but it makes it very intense. I thought the subtitles were going to get really annoying, but I got used to them fast and they only bothered me a few times when they were talking pretty fast. Overall, I feel this movie is unique, awesome, and great. Very deserving of the high rating it has right now, 10/10.",10,0,3,9 August 2008
I Am Legend," A very irregular, unique movie
","I went into this movie expecting it to be OK. Boy was I wrong! This was a very moving,sad,gripping movie. If it weren't for some plot holes, this would be a great movie. It was also much shorter than it should have been. Sometimes you wouldn't know what was going on, which was a bit annoying. But it also makes you want to watch more. However, it was a bit more sad than I expected. There also wasn't as much action as I thought there would be. There were some boring parts that the film could have been without. Also I haven't read the book so I wouldn't be able to compare this to it. I would give it a 8/10, and warning:this movie may give kids nightmares, pretty disturbing for a PG 13.",8,0,2,2 January 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This movie really got me turned onto Tarantino.
","This movie was really entertaining. The fighting scenes weren't greatly realistic, but they weren't really meant to be. There is a lot of blood, and it isn't for the faint-hearted. But, if you can stand bloody violence, then this movie is very, very good. The actors are surprisingly very good. Uma Thurman fit in the role of The Bride perfectly. All of the main villains do good,(but some of the minors are funny) but they made you kind of like them usually. Anyways, it may not have all been action-packed, but it gave you much anticipation of those parts. When the fighting scenes did come around, they were very entertaining to watch, and made me exclaim,'Whoah!'. The ending left you wanting more, a great bit of a cliffhanger for volume 2. 9/10, great movie.This movie really got me to start watching a lot of Tarantino movies, and he's become my favorite director now.",10,0,2,16 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Excellent movie. But not quite #1!
","First off, I gave this movie a 10 because my standards for movies aren't high, and this one definitely exceeds. I know it sounds like I'm contradicting myself,(Giving it a 10 and saying it shouldn't be number 1) but in my book, this movie deserves a 10. Anyways, I loved the dark feel of the movie, as many other people have said. Christopher Nolan made Gotham perfectly. Heath Ledger did do an awesome job as the joker, and I feel he actually does deserve an Oscar for his performance. It was gripping, thrilling, and even pretty scary/intense at moments. Christian Bale also did very well as Batman, much better than everyone else who's done Batman in the past. The ending is great, one of the best ending's I've seen in a while. Overall, this movie was written great, and executed perfectly. Movies like this don't come around too often. Excellent, 10/10.",10,9,19,4 August 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Brilliant movie.
","The plot of this movie just blew me away...It was just awesome. Then the acting was great for a non-all star cast, and Tarantino executed it very well. My impression on the movie changed, because I heard it had banned in other countries for violence, but there wasn't that much. I thought it was going to have a ton of action and stuff, but it was really just a cool movie with some pretty awesome scenes in it. I thought some parts were funny, some parts were smart, some parts were sad, and some parts were just cool. That's why I like Tarantino, most of his films blend so much stuff into them, this is one of those. Also, the ending of Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen. Overall, great movie.9/10.",9,2,3,27 August 2008
The Descent," Not very good
","I didn't like The Descent very much. First of all, the story is very good. It just wasn't executed very well. Half of the time, I couldn't see what was happening very well, so I didn't really know what was going on. It seemed like I had to rely on my hearing to figure out what was going on. There were a few intense battling scenes that were interesting, but that's really the only thing that caught my attention besides the story. The monsters are very weird, and I kind of wanted to know where they came from and what they were, but that didn't bother me too much. It just seemed kind of boring, as in the parts where the monster would be looking for them just weren't very scary. I also didn't like the ending very much, but it wasn't too bad. 4/10, not very good",4,0,1,5 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," Hard to describe. Great anyhow.
","Pulp Fiction is one of the few timeless movies that I have ever seen. Many people argue about the main message, I think you should just enjoy the movie how it is.Pulp Fiction's about two gangster partners who are retrieving an extremely special suitcase for their boss. In the process, a man shoots 3 bullets at them, but they all miss. One of the gangsters recalls this as a miracle, or work of god, which later makes him decide to retire and simply 'Walk the Earth'. His partner, however, thinks this is a bit dumb and later gets killed by a boxer.This boxer had been payed by the gangster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to lose his fight the night before. He has a dream about the day he received a watch that had been passed down in his family for a long time, and accidentally killed the other boxer. His girlfriend forgot to get his watch from his old apartment, which he knew Wallace was going to inspect, but he knew his watch was important enough to die for. So he got it back, killing one of Wallace's gangsters in the process. He soon meets Wallace himself as they are trapped by a pawn shop owner. The pawn shop owner and his friend start to rape Wallace, and the boxer escapes, but before he does, he kills the rapists with a sword, freeing Wallace, who forgives him a little bit.Two robbers are robbing a restaurant that the two gangsters are eating at. One of the gangsters gives them $1500 and talks to one of them for a long time about a section of the bible. They then proceed to deliver the case to Wallace.The plot weaves together(as the page says) these unrelated people in 4 stories of violence, humor, and guidance.All in all, a wonderful movie never to be forgotten.",10,0,1,31 July 2008
Bruce Almighty," Very funny!
","This movie was one of those comedies where there's a lot of hilarious parts, but a lot of boring parts. Usually those movies kind of get on my nerve, but this one had a pretty good storyline behind it. That made most of the boring parts have a bit of a point. So, it was a bit unbelievable, but funny. Also, unlike most comedies, the main character goes through a change. Bruce starts out as a bit of a jerk who likes to blame God for most of his misfortunes. Then, God notices this and meets Bruce, giving him his powers for a while. At first, Bruce uses the powers to only his advantage. He then notices how he can help so many other people and be a good person. So by the end of the movie, Bruce has gone through a massive change, now praising God for his good fortunes.Overall, a very entertaining and funny movie. 8/10",8,1,1,11 July 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the best horror movies of all time.
","Nightmare On Elm Street was a wonderful movie! A catchy, creative script executed great with a good director and good actors, it succeeded expectations. I tried watching it with my friends, but they hated it because of the 'magic' used by Freddy. But I didn't mind it, it was a bit corny, but it made him more scary. Freddy is a chilling character. He's probably one of the most creative and scary characters ever, and I thought they used him perfectly. They didn't show him too much, but just enough to make you wide-eyed every time he appears. The actors aren't wonderful, but they do an exceptional job. The only acting that bothered me was Heather Langenkamp's work on Nancy. I don't know why, she just kind of bothered me. The ending was kind of dumb and corny. But it kind of worked as a cliffhanger, although they didn't use that cliffhanger at all ever again.Anyways, one of the best horror movies of all time in my opinion. 9/10.",9,0,0,13 July 2008
Jackie Brown," Very unique movie.
","Recently I've become a huge fan of Tarantino, and this was one of the 2 movies of his I hadn't seen(can't find the other one) so I rented it. I loved Samuel L Jackson in his role and De Niro was funny. The plot was unique, sometimes confusing, and barely ever boring. Samuel L Jackson does a great job as a gun merchant who will stop at nothing to reach $1,000,000, and this movie just shows why he is one of my favorite actors. De Niro is quiet, but for some reason I found him really funny. No, this movie is no Pulp Fiction, but to me that's kind of a dumb remark, it means nothing besides this movie is not one of the greatest movies of all time(which you should not expect out of it), which is perfectly fine. Anyways, a very good movie.8/10.",8,1,1,26 August 2008
V for Vendetta," Great!
","V for Vendetta was a very interesting movie. Let me start by saying that Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving did an excellent job, they really captured their characters well. I thought the Wachowski's really gave a good feel of how bad of a situation the world was in by frequently showing news clips of how terrible America was functioning.I liked the pace of the movie, too, though I must admit that I did get lost a couple times, but got right back into it. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, the story is complex and makes you think. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it's harder to follow than average films are. Do not go into this movie expecting it to be action-packed or full of violence, because it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. Also, I loved the ending, I thought it played out very well. Overall, great film, 9/10.",9,3,12,21 March 2009
