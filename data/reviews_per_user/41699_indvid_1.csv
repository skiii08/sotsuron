Requiem for a Dream," A Home Run
","The story of 4 individuals each dealing with addiction, this will definetly not be everyone's cup of tea, but this is one of the finest independent films I've seen. In the hands of a less talented Director this would have been a plodding depressing story of self destruction. In the hands of Hubert Selby, this is a thoughtful, disturbing and well crafted tale. The repetitive 'eye dilatation' scene representing the drug rush...the haunting refridgerator...the careful use of POV camera shots both from in front and behind the subject and extreme camera angles... these are all skillfully used effects that help to bring the audience into the off balance world of the addict. The finale, where all 4 stories come to a climax, is masterfully edited sequence. Compliments to Jay Rabinowitz. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a well thought out story, skillfully shot & masterfully edited.",10,0,1,20 December 2003
