The Ring," My favorite horror movie...
","Unique, creepy, horrifying and well-crafted. One of the few movies that has ever given me nightmares! A true 'must see' for any horror fan.",10,1,1,15 January 2019
It," A scary movie that isn't scary!
","What a disappointment! Not scary or frightening in the least. As a matter of fact, I was tempted to laugh during the so-called scary clown scenes. Seemed almost like a parody of a horror movie. What a waste!",2,2,4,18 October 2018
Hereditary," Don't waste your time!
","I could write a dissertation on how bad this movie was. Bad story, slow agonizing pace, and no pay off. I am now convinced that some of the reviews on IMDB are fake. I can't believe anyone that watched this movie could think it was worth the time. Don't waste yours!",2,2,6,18 September 2018
Rocketman," If you like musicals...
","If you like musicals, you might like it. I don't like musicals.I was hoping for something like 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. This is nothing like that. It's a musical fantasy, with emphasis on fantasy. Yes, we gain some good insight into the background of the musical genius that is Elton John, but as a biography, it left me flat.",4,8,13,14 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Much better than previous versions...
",Best film I've seen all year! Lady Gaga was phenomenal and Bradley Cooper masterful in his role and as a director. The original songs were gripping and powerful. This is an instant classic!,10,1,2,10 October 2018
Cold Mountain," One of the greatest movies, ever!
","Great tale of a confederate deserter during the Civil War. All-Star cast with great performances all around. If you haven't seen it, you're missing something special.",10,1,1,29 March 2020
Midsommar," Do not watch under any circumstance!
",Bizarre. Slow.. Meritless. A waste of 2.5 hours. Don't do it!,2,6,12,22 April 2020
Creed II," Formulaic and predictable...
","The latest Rocky movie, Creed II, is OK but I was expecting more. Typical fairytale, feel good stuff. Not as good as the first Creed, but more character depth. Honestly, this film series has run its course. I hope they don't make another one!",6,1,2,4 December 2018
