The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Book readers vs Non-book Readers
","First of all, i've watched all of the Hunger Games movies, and i haven't read the books. The first 2 was really good because of the action, and that there was actually happening something in the movie, that kind of gave a plot to that specific movie. This movie tho, is just a big foreplay for the second part. Don't get me wrong, i couldn't be more excited for the second part, but there isn't really happening something in this movie like the last ones. Ofcource is there some action scenes here and there, but it has nothing compared to the last books. I would like to say, that the actors are doing a REALLY good job. Their acting is really good, and you can clearly feel the emotional part going on their lives, and the directors did a good job making the audience feel the same way. I would like to say tho, that if you have read the books, and you know whats coming and what its like, you will properly like the movie (not giving any guarantees. I've heard that it matched the book pretty well. In my opinion isn't should there be more action, or there should be more excitement. There is a lot of talking and a lot of emotional going on, and for a person who hasn't read the books, that not what you wont to see, not after the 2 before that.",5,8,10,28 December 2014
