Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is a great film but...
","I thought this movie was great but one thing that bothered me throughout the time it came out and while I was watching this movie. The original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi had great technology and Episode 1 is before in time so why does Episode 1 have a lot better technology. I mean most of the soldiers in Episode 1 were droids or robots, and in the original Star Wars they were men in white costumes. Anyway besides all that this movie was great. Now all I have to do is sit back and wait for the next 2.",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious
","When I saw this movie, I was like I am finally seeing it, and well, I got what I wanted. I expected a real funny movie(knowing that since I watch the show every week)and I got a real funny movie. Yes bad, and not for kids, since there is alot of vulgarity and nudity, this movie made me crack up. They sing songs that make you laugh, the commom sense knowledge that we have that of course they don't have is funny. I have nothing against Canadians either, but the way that they made fun of them in the movie was also hilarious, the accents and the way they make their heads move. So if you watch the show, or if you like cartoons, or if you love comedy, go see South Park.",Null,0,0,8 July 1999
Jurassic Park," My favorite movie of all time.
","Jurassic Park, directed by one of the greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. I watched this movie and I was hooked, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It has everything a movie is suppose to have, action, suspense, I guess you could say there is some comedy in the movie.But best of all, its graphics. The dinosaurs looked so real, and even though you know that they are fake(or are they)Steven kept you on the edge of your seat, especially in the kitchen scene with Tim and Lex Murphy.So basically if you haven't seen this Blockbuster yet, you better go see or otherwise you are missing out on a great movie expierience.(Note:This is an O-K family movie, just don't expect a pure family movie)If you have seen Jurassic Park, you should check out The Lost World, the sequel. Or you can check out some other great Spielberg films, Schindler's List, ET, and The Indiana Jones Story with Harrison Ford.",Null,1,2,8 July 1999
