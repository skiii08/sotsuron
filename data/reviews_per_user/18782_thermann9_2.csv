Kill Bill: Vol. 2," oh-ver-ra-ted
","What are you people thinking? The first movie was exceptional (though ultra-violent) weaving action and storyline while simultaneously paying homage to Tarantino's influences of the 60's and 70's. II is just hot air and bravado. Big let down after the build up of the first movie. Sadly lacking in action with the worst dialogue I've heard in years. It was like watching a bad 70's B movie, which was a big disappointment after the promise of I. Turns out this would have made a good one part movie. II is just filler and hokey dialogue. Carradine holds his own in the first movie, but is sadly lacking in screen presence in II. I actually busted out laughing when the explanation comes out as to why Bill attacked the bride in the first place. I was in tears laughing during the build up for the final fight, which never materializes. Save yourself the time and if you've only seen part I, just leave it at that. If I missed something, please don't make a post that I'm an idiot, just explain it to me. I just didn't get it.",Null,5,10,5 September 2004
The Departed," The Departed, go ahead and depart..please!
","Not a terrible movie, but WAY overrated. Ridiculous dialog, predictable, and scenes that run on forever. Jack Nicholson overacts to such a degree that I laughed at several scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. And if I were the Boston State Police, I'd be furious at the depiction of unprofessional, irrational behavior exhibited by the central characters. Damon is a terrific actor, but seemed oddly miscast as a corrupt cop. I actually think Wahlberg would have been better as the morally bankrupt cop and Damon would have been better as the good cop with the anger management problem. So, not a bad movie, but I was terribly disappointed based upon the reviews and ratings listed here.",6,2,4,26 February 2007
