Changeling," too richly filmed for telling of terrible, real events
","i am about a 50-50 fan of C. Eastwood's directorial style, and The Changeling fell on the not-so-much side. it was ambitious, had great material to work w/, but i blv it succumbed to the temptation of overly-drenched cinematography and way too pretty costuming and set, especially for such a dark and real subject. it does the actual events a disservice by emphasizing so overtly stylish costuming, veiled eyes, bright-red lipstick, sepia-toned police rooms and craggy-faced character actors. just too obvious and heavy-handed. i root for Eastwood as a director, but he can rely too heavily on stylistic conventions, which detracts from getting involved in a story. A. Jolie's acting did not help, either. This can point to weak direction, but in any case, i just don't feel that she delivered on a true, raw level. it was all rather clichéd and superficial. frankly, she has never lived up to the potential she showed in 'Girl, Interrupted' (in which she was the only good thing, and deserved the Oscar), and has excelled only as the cartoony, action-figure Lara Croft since then. maybe she should just leave it at that. and maybe Eastwood should stick to fiction.",5,1,7,21 February 2009
The Notebook," Gosling and serene setting save otherwise drab outing
","Doesn't Rachel McAdams's acting make anyone else gag as much as me?? Ugh. Granted, Nicholas Sparks is a dismally poor writer... he relies on cliché after cliché after cliché, w/out fleshing out any of his characters or plots beyond two-dimensional predictability, but McAdams ALmost ruins the entire affair for me. Wanting to act well doesn't mean actually acting well. She is cute, perky and tries very hard, but she simply adds no depth to the bland character written by Sparks. The stunning cast surrounding her (R. Gosling, G. Rowlands, J. Garner, S. Shepard) demonstrates how flatly-written roles can be imbued w/ depth, whereas she plays it exactly as it is written: 'high-spirited Southern girl torn between Southern gentry and working-class stud'. Every time I hear her fake laugh, I cringe and have to either look away or mimic her flailings. I definitely blame Cassavetes' direction, as well; I suspect he was so taken w/ her cuteness, that he didn't recognize the vapidity of her performance. It wouldn't be the first time!! Ha ha. The remarkable acting of R. Gosling, however (have you seen Half Nelson?? Dude.), plus the stunning N. Carolina scenery, i.e., the righteous cinematography of Robert Fraisse, are what keep me coming back, time after time, even though it involves a lot or eye-rolling and heavy sighs. I do think that, given the crappy aspects of the film, the only way you will enjoy watching this one is if you're a hard-up girl :)",4,5,7,25 July 2009
The Dark Knight," waste of Ledger's abilities
","oh, what a travesty! i was pretty jacked up to see this, but it failed on a number of fronts. definitely, Ledger's work was admirable, as was all the work of the estimable cast, but nothing could save the poor, poor directorship/editing of this abysmal cookie-cutter, video-game, i-don't-know-what of a movie... what a disappointment! i can't blv what an appalling lack of understanding of story-telling the director (C. Nolan) showed, after such brilliant work as 'Memento', etc.; i can't blv it's the same guy! honestly, i fwd'd through the last 1/3 of the movie... was it really just 2 1/2 hours? and i LOVE long movies, as long as they use the time to develop character/plot/etc... but this was just such a mish-mash of images, effects, bla-bla-bla, that i couldn't care less, as much as i wanted to respect Ledger's last work. what a shame. 9 out of 10 stars, on average?!? ugh. i think we've got a generation raised on video-games, unable to distinguish between flashy scenes of fire and throatily-delivered dialogue and true, developed story. sigh..... :(",3,3,7,30 January 2009
There Will Be Blood," oil man goes bad amidst very good acting
","this movie will leave some moviegoers mistaking dramatic sienna-hued cinematography, powerful acting and startling music for a film with deeper meaning. (the film doesn't merit a longer comment, but in order to get my 3 stars posted, 10 lines of comments are required, so... Lewis' acting is superb, no surprise; there is no real point to the movie, however, other than to show bad people being bad, petty people being petty, etc.; cinematography is enjoyable; went to the theater with high hopes, looking forward to a film i could really 'sink my teeth into', but this just left me wanting to spit in the dirt. disappointing one for Anderson.)",3,8,17,17 February 2008
