Insidious: Chapter 2," Has big problems, but is still a positive experience.
","I liked 'Insidious' a lot. I liked the story, the visuals, and the otherworldly touches. It is one of my favorite modern horror films along with 'The Ring', '1408', 'Sinister' and 'Conjuring'. All of those movies have their share of unwarranted problems, which is a testament to how modern horror pales completely in comparison to the good old days, but I still liked those ones. I mentioned them just to give an idea of my taste, letting people know if my opinion helps them or not.Since I didn't get a chance to see 'Insidious: chapter 2' at a theater, I bought it as soon as it was released. Just finished watching it. Although it isn't nearly as solid as the first one and does disappoint in some areas, it's still a pretty good movie. Certainly nothing more, and 'pretty good' might be stretching it a bit, but it's on the positive side of the scale nonetheless.Chapter 2 takes place almost right after where 'Insidious' ended. One might argue that seeing the first one isn't absolutely necessary to understand this movie, but I still recommend seeing it before watching this one.The story surprised me a little, because at its core it's quite good. There's a new mystery, but also some history about our main characters and clever links to tie it all together, including these two films themselves. Thumbs up for the concept, because Chapter 2 feels like a part of a bigger story, not just a forced sequel - even though this sequel is most likely very, very forced and I think James Wan didn't even try to give it his best. Anyway, I liked the concept and many things are handled quite well.Soon, it becomes clear that the strong impression doesn't last. This movie takes turns with hits and misses, and it struggles to find its comfort zone. Was this production rushed? Was James Wan too busy with 'Conjuring' to really give a damn? Was the writer/actor Leigh Whannell too busy playing a funny ghost hunter to finish some parts of the script? I don't know. What I do know is that at times Chapter 2 is shoddy. For every great moment there is a stupid moment. For every interesting and fresh breath there is a cheap scare from the museum of creepy things, sounds and dolls. The film is just not tight as a whole. Some really basic things are handled in a half-assed manner, straight from the pages of some lazy fanfiction. 'We need that to happen, doesn't matter how much sense it makes' - moments made me shake my head, especially one (you'll know it when you see it). Horribly spoon-fed exposition and some parts of the dialogue made me cringe too. It seems like they had good material for 50 minutes, and then started adding stuff to it to justify the project.Those were the problems for me. I'm not even complaining about the often-disliked comic relief, I actually welcomed that element even though it worked better in the first movie. But, even with the problems I mentioned there is some serious quality to this movie. It struggles to keep itself intact, but it's got something going for it. Perhaps it's more of a testament to the lousy state of modern horror than a compliment for this film, but this is still clearly better than your average horror movie. The cast is the same with a few additions. Everyone does a pretty good job as usual. Danielle Bisutti was the surprising standout for me. Visually everything looks good. The colors, the sets, the mood/scare effects, makeup, everything looks good. I preferred the slightly more macabre tone from the first one, and the designs aren't all top notch here, but nevertheless this department is a strength of this film and doesn't disappoint.It's a little sad when a sequel with an actually good concept isn't handled carefully, because usually the substance isn't there. In this case it is, but it's an of/off-relationship. When it works it's great, then it's forgotten again. This could've been a little modern horror classic for me. It isn't even close. That said, James Wan's 'Insidious: chapter 2' is still a positive experience. I usually give horror movies some slack, so take my 7/10 with a grain of salt. If you're normally not into these flicks, don't take this as a recommendation.I hope (a motivated) James Wan returns for Chapter 3 (edit: he didn't), because otherwise we just might get a series of crappy movies with no resemblance to what originally made them good.",7,0,0,5 March 2014
The Avengers," Joss Whedon, thank you sir.
","The Avengers is a movie that could've gone wrong in a billion ways. I didn't believe this could actually work, even with Whedon on charge. I thought the balance between showing enough of every character, handling our heroes with the credibility they deserve, the whole story concept...I thought it was almost impossible to handle.And it probably is almost impossible to handle. Guess what? Joss Whedon and the cast handled it. They nailed it. The Avengers is an excellent movie.We've seen plenty of Marvel movies that do something well, something OK and something bad. Usually, there's something lacking. X2, for me, was nearly the best Marvel movie to date and I can't find significant flaws from it. Many Marvel movies are mediocre and some of them downright suck (Fantastic Four) beyond belief, so the Avengers could've gone wrong or been just 'OK'. I grew up with those comics, imagining these characters in action. It wasn't just action, you really got into the personal drama as well. It was part of my life.Now, I'm a grown man. And never before has my inner child cried this many happy tears. Let me tell you why Avengers in simply a great movie.1) Acting. Downey jr. is very good, sticking to his Iron man role, and yet having scenes that don't involve just cracking jokes. Mark Ruffalo - I simply loved him as Banner/Hulk. I've grown to like Ruffalo more and more, and he just nailed Hulk. What about the actors of Thor and Loki? In the movie Thor, I didn't...quite like them. Somehow, they do well. No one's a liability, I'm even satisfied with Chris Evans. Scarlett Johansson is as beautiful as ever, doesn't really do her best but she isn't your useless Megan Fox either. Everyone, every actor did at least OK, most of them good.2) Contrast and structure. In Avengers, there is plenty of humor, and it isn't too forced. Even though you know the jokes aren't THAT great, you still laugh. You buy it. There are also a few sentimental scenes and they mostly succeed. Remember Wolverine crying 'NOOOO' in X3 and Origins? Yes, that sucked. None of that crap here with Avengers. When it's serious, it's serious and you take it seriously. When it's funny, it's funny and just for the right reasons. Also, the plot. I'm not giving out any spoilers, but...you know it isn't THAT great of a plot, and you know it would be hard to make it work due to it's 'scale'. You know what? It works just fine. Somehow, Whedon is able to take something that seems stupid, cliché'd, out of place...and make it work. It's never that intelligent nor ingenious but it gives enough reasons for what's happening. 3) Handling the characters, our heroes. Every single one of them gets plenty of screen time. Every single one of them has at least a couple of amazing action scenes and a bunch of excellent ones as well. I can't stress this enough - you can see every one of them actually ENOUGH. Not kidding. Another thing - the characters are treated with respect. Whedon is a fanboy himself. He wanted to do these characters justice. He wanted to show and portray these heroes RIGHT. He succeeded. Oh yes, Hulk too. Especially him. You'll love him. Justice is served. None of the characters is an idiot, everyone gets treated with respect.4) Action. Visuals. My mouth was open for the last 30 minutes. It literally was. I was cheering, I was pumped. I was a child again. The incredible action scenes, visuals, characters, everything. Absolutely everything clicked when it mattered the most. This is what happens, when you give a capable fanboy a crapload of Hollywood money. You don't get sucky transformers sequels, no. You get quality. You get your inner child the satisfaction he/she never got before from these movies. You get the Avengers.This is almost a perfect Marvel movie. I seriously doubt there are many filmmakers who could've nailed this so well. X2 is still my favorite superhero movie, but man...this is right up there with the best.Excuse me while I watch my Avengers blu-ray again. And again.",9,3,7,12 September 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Villeneuve did it. He actually did it.
","Imagine a bunch of corporate hacks making a sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner'. Imagine the horrible dialogue, lack of expression, pointless action, telegraphed plot, soulless acting, generic score with mind-numbing pop songs, quick cuts, forced political messages, setting things up for another sequel...imagine those boxes being ticked in a boardroom, in order to make something truly meaningless and offensive to any sentient being. This is not it.'Blade Runner 2049' is fantastic. In a time where every movie franchise is butchered in the name of lowest common denominator in an effort to turn them into brands only, this is almost too good to be true.I'll describe this movie without spoilers. It's not an action movie. It's slow and takes its time. It isn't trying to cynically impress you. It's not interested in making the same movie again but it's still very familiar. It's not about grand happenings, it's surprisingly confined. It honors the original, works very well with it and also without it. It respects its audience enough. It's a thematic, long ride full of atmosphere, making you feel like you're in a trance. It downplays blunt-force emotional drama almost to the point of disconnect, but it really does have a heart. For a sequel that never should have been made, there's something genuine about this film.I noticed something great in almost every scene: they're really intimate and tight. Most of the time we have only one or two people sharing a scene, and they're shot in a very personal way, elevating the themes. The dystopian world is just the background for the story, not the whole point of it. When a movie makes you think about humanity, individuality and soul, you want to have those moments without distractions and feel the scenes no matter what. '2049' absolutely nails this and the actors can really focus on their job and immerse the audience. The amount of restraint shown throughout this movie is remarkable. Less is indeed more. Technically, '2049' is a triumph. Roger Deakins is a master of his craft. Yes, you get plenty of 'Blade Runner shots' where light, shadows and reflections dance beautifully, but this movie isn't content in only mimicking the original. You'll see so much wonderful stuff here that film school students will have plenty of material for years to come. Cinematography, sets, designs, editing and effects are all superb and most of all elevate the story and its themes. It's an absolute treat to the eyes, it's majestic. Hats off to the entire production crew.It's easy on the ears too. Vangelis composed a superior score before, and while I prefer a more melodic approach in general, the music here is a vital part of the experience. That powerful Zimmer noise gives us some 'oomph' while the dreamy synths create an atmosphere. I'm not sure if it works outside the imagery, but it does capture some of the Vangelis mood without losing all personality. It's not afraid to stop either; silence is used effectively, and it has an impact every time. Let's not forget about the sound department - they deserve a round of applause. Whatever you hear is carefully thought out, mixed and produced. And once again it's not there to show off, it's there for a reason. The cast was great. Gosling was a perfect fit and so much better than I hoped, Ana de Armas was a beautiful revelation (as was her character), and Harrison Ford clearly cared about his role. Jared Leto was a bit of a distraction for me, but I fully acknowledge that's my own fault: I have a habit of seeing Leto instead of a character. I snapped out of it soon though, and he did a good job. I liked Sylvia Hoeks, and even though Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis and Carla Juri also distracted me at first for whatever reason, they were great too. Everyone (including Dave Bautista) delivered, even those with small parts. I left out some names because I consider them spoilers.Director Villeneuve, writers Fancher (welcome back sir!) + Scott + Green, cinematographer Deakins, the cast and the production crew pulled it off. 'Blade Runner 2049' is a product of love and far better than it has any right to be. It works so well as a sequel and somehow still stands on its own legs. It made me appreciate the original 'Blade Runner' even more in the process, and helped me to make peace with some of my old gripes about it. If '2049' handled some of the exposition (and narrative flow) a little better and had a few more happy accidents here and there, I'd give this a 10 in a heartbeat. Perhaps - in time - I will.'Blade Runner 2049' is expertly crafted and a wonderful film. I can't believe it exists, because just like the original, it's not a product of its time and it will be shunned by many. It's not quite art-house, but has a huge artistic quality to it. It allows you to ponder, sink deep into a mood and soak in every bit of the atmosphere. It's amazing how many things it got right, considering it's a sequel to one of the most loved movies of all time. It could've gone wrong in so many ways. It's got some rough edges and it isn't wholly original (and at times doesn't even want to be), but it's still true cinema and definitely worth seeing in a theater. My theater experience was great: charmingly small room, not too crowded, everyone was quiet, volume was up high. And when it ended, most of us just sat there quietly, still feeling that wonderful trance.Is it better than the original? Doesn't matter, it's not even interested in such vain goals. If you're new to these movies, I envy you. You get to experience these masterful films for the first time.",10,6,19,6 October 2017
Alien 3," Tried to love it but can only like it at times.
","I've seen Alien 3 many, many times now. The extended version too.When it came to theaters, I was sooo waiting for it, being an alien-fan. Well, I liked it, but some things always bothered me. My urge to love this film was so huge that only now I can try to review this film clearly.First of all, there isn't much thrilling suspense in this one. The environment is OK, and the jail complex just looks great. It's dark and it's huge - and very well done. The characters are OK, I like the British guys. Some of them are even remotely interesting. But then again, many of the interesting convicts seem to be just statists, as they run for 4 seconds and die. The film reaches a point where you're not sure that who died and who is still alive, and what's that guys name - pretty much all of the characters just lose their points.The story, it isn't bad you know. It's OK, and the overall 'feel' of the film is kinda depressing. That's OK too, though it has an effect on you. The effect is that you're feeling kinda low all the time and reacting to the depressing environment, and the alien encounters or characters' deaths have little or no impact on you. Then again, I was always fascinated about the looks of the alien. How it's done, how it moves, and how it's just so damn cool. So the lack of suspense didn't bother me so much. In this film, alien does look great. The close-up shots, where only the upper torso of the alien is seen, are great, just great. It looks great and moves great. ....and now I'm getting to the biggest let-down. I'm not a guy who loves special effects over everything else, but the computer graphics are just UGLY. Sometimes the alien looks like a paper doll glued on a photograph. It looks so bad, and the movement is horrible. These are the scenes where the immersion totally goes away. In the directors' cut there are few scenes which would have been great, but the CG is just so bad it makes me sad. Pretty ironic...you have the best close-ups of the beast in Alien 3, and also the worst computer graphics. Wish the damn thing was done old-fashioned, like Alien or Aliens.Then again, bad CG doesn't change the fact that I have seen this film like 20 times. And that is a lot. There is a lot to enjoy, and the film is very serious. It is a worthy addition to the Alien series, but I hoped it could've been better.Fincher is one of my favorite directors. He was not given enough room or resources with this one, it's clear. My rating is 7 out of 10. A good movie.",7,2,5,2 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," RedLetterMedia already closed the case
","...but I still wanted to express my own feelings about this movie. Phantom Menace is like a cancerous tissue you just have to keep studying, because every time you do, you find a new cancer. I didn't even understand, at first, that Phantom Menace has cancer all over it. I just thought it was a somewhat disappointing movie about space politics, cartoon kangaroos, a nice end battle with lightsabers and a great score. Now I'm sure that not only does it have cancer, but it also IS cancer.The denial was strong at first. There's a guy called Obi-Wan, there's a kid called Anakin, there are lightsabers, there is the music of John Williams, George Lucas made it...this is Star Wars! And if it's Star Wars, it can't be that bad, right? Then, after the years went by, I had watched the original trilogy many more times and started to make comparisons. Granted, Lucas spread his cancer all over the original trilogy too, but he couldn't kill the greatness of those movies. The greatness is still there, even if it is covered by digital feces, horrible changes and all sorts of nonsensical crap. The original trilogy had heart. I actually cared about those people! They had real emotions! I cared about what was happening! I could tell you a reason for almost everything that happened in those movies. I cannot tell you a single reason why anything happened in Phantom Menace.Phantom Menace is written by a child pretending to be a writer. If you manage to get your head out of the cloudy box of apathy and boredom this movie tries to keep you in, you'll notice that absolutely nothing about Phantom Menace's space politics make sense. Try it, I dare you. Try to think about the space politics. If you manage to do it without bleeding from your face and skull, you are truly a hero. And since the space politics are the reason for everything that is happening, the movie has already lost. It lost before it even tried.Phantom Menace tries to set things up that eventually lead to episode IV: A New Hope, so everything is crammed in there, and none of it works individually or together. The force is explained by midi-chlorians (a form of space cancer caused by shitty screen writing), which in turn are the reason Anakin even gets noticed. We even got C-3PO and R2D2. Why? Probably just that you wouldn't notice how bad the movie is, when it throws familiar faces and names at you. Or to sell toys. Probably the toys.Jar-Jar Binks, the unfunny space kangaroo, is a red herring. He is a horrible character and deserving of all hate and several mutilations, but if you take him out of the movie, the movie doesn't get any better. At least he made me feel something, even if it was rage and disappointment. Like so many other things in this movie, Jar-Jar Binks is there to distract you so you wouldn't notice the structure of the movie itself. Jar-Jar Binks is Podracing in a character form: absolutely meaningless crap with rabbit ears.I feel bad for several people. I feel bad for the kid who plays Anakin. He is horrible, but someone should've stopped him. He is not to blame for the mess he was in. I feel bad for the main actors too, who had nothing to work with but miles of green screen and disinterested directing from George Lucas. It's telling of Liam Neeson's charisma, that I managed to like him, even though he was given horrible lines, horrible directing and horrible script. Pretty much everyone else came out flat.But most of all: I feel bad for the people who saw this. I feel bad for the people who are too young to never have seen the original trilogy in its theatrical glory without the crappy changes Lucas made when this movie was released. I feel bad for the people who got a passionless piece of glimmering digital crap instead of a real movie from a franchise they loved. George Lucas, once a rogue filmmaker, had turned into a bored businessman. This is the result.Is there anything good in Phantom Menace? Well, yes. I did like the end battle. Too much choreography and too little feeling, but it's still cool. Darth Maul has potential as a bad guy, even though eventually he is wasted. The music is excellent, as well as much of the sound department. I liked Liam Neeson, but just because he's Liam Neeson. His character though, in the end, was as useless and contrived as everything else in these prequels.Check out RedLetterMedia's Plinkett Reviews of the prequel trilogy if you already haven't. They're gold. Also, check out the Despecialized Edition of the original trilogy. Some people made their own HD cuts of the original movies, taking out the changes Lucas forced on us in 1997. It's worth it. Get it, if not for yourself, then at least for your kids. Let them see the movie magic from 1977 to 1983.George, you can't win. You once made a movie we all love. Stop trying to kill it. Please get help. I'm glad you don't hold the rights to the franchise anymore. Disney and Fox, please do the right thing and release the theaterical versions for the public. I don't question that you are companies full of bored businessmen and/or aliens too, but just for once, do something human to make us think otherwise. Please.",3,0,7,17 December 2015
The Equalizer," If you're ready to forgive some stupidities, you're good to go.
","First things first: 'The Equalizer' has nothing to do with the TV series. The main character's name (McCall) is the same, but that's it. If you're looking for some nostalgia, you won't find it here.This is a simple action thriller along the lines of most revenge movies, with very traditional strengths and weaknesses. I'll keep it short this time.Strengths: Denzel Washington has presence. He doesn't even have to act, it's enough that he's just there. The movie is R-rated, which is always a plus. The main bad guy (Marton Csokas) has plenty of charisma. This film as well as the action is well shot, there is a lot of 'cool factor' and director Antoine Fuqua knows the beats of this genre. This movie is straightforward, well enough paced and easy to follow.Weaknesses: While there are plenty of cool shots, effects and sound, it's often used just for the hell of it. Even the music seems to serve the coolness and individual scene composition, not the movie itself. All of this takes you out of the movie a couple of times. 'Equalizer' has more style than substance, and while the script does what it's supposed to do, a lot of subtleties are wasted in the execution. Much of some well-created suspense (as well as any impact of Csokas' character) is gone when it becomes clear that Denzel Washington's McCall can handle any situation with ease. Sometimes when McCall is fighting one enemy out of ten, the whole world stops around him until enemy number one is dealt with. These are the kinds of clichés you will have to deal with.Summary: This is not an intelligent movie, I'd say even Taken is more believable. Much of the buildup is eventually wasted, as the promising thriller-aspect of the movie decides to just go away and make room for consequence-free action. Suspension of disbelief is a must, but for the fans of some oldschool, simple action movies that aren't PG13-pussified, I'd give a recommendation. I enjoyed it for what it was to some extent. I listed far more negatives than positives, but the good moments were good enough to tip the scale more to my liking. I was never bored, and Denzel Washington killing bad guys can be a nice form of movie therapy. In the sequel, I hope they manage to make a tighter movie that knows what it is, and hold the suspense to the very end. At least make McCall less of a superman.",6,1,1,14 August 2015
Iron Man 3," Love/hate relationship.
","Finally watched it.I'm not a great fan of Marvel/Disney collaboration. Let's get some of my main gripes out first. Hear me out, Disney/Marvel:Don't force child characters into these movies. It's exactly that, forcing and it feels like it too (although it didn't bother me as much as I originally thought). Don't make it seem like a punch from an IM suit does nothing to a regular person, it would break their necks. Don't force this many jokes into a movie series that already, at the very lowest level, has enough humor that works. Don't include some trite gunfights with absolutely no sense of danger into these movies. Don't think that including Bill Maher and Joan Rivers isn't ridiculous. Don't think a mediocre (or bad) plot isn't mediocre (or bad) because tons of crap is happening all the time as a smokescreen. Overall, some things do not make sense and not only that, but some of the scenes negate some established 'facts' from the first two films. Disney, I hate you. Go away. Go ruin some teen female actors, you ridiculous, despicable shadow of a company you once were. There, now I got those out of the way. There were annoyances, yes. They could've toned down the silliness, some useless scenes and characters and make things a little more mean, more serious business. Sad that they didn't, because simply by removing stuff and not adding to those I mentioned, they would've made this a better Iron Man movie. If my complaints have nothing to do with Disney and everything to do the director and writer, then...nah, I still hate Disney.Now, to the good and neutral things. It is very, very entertaining. There's a lot of stuff happening almost all the time. Some of the action is inventive and all of it looks good. Some of the jokes that don't suck are pretty good. Iron Man 3 is never boring - not once - and almost every scene has a couple of layers. Not deep layers, but 'not boring'-layers. IM3 is very rewatchable. On my blu-ray version the picture quality is great as well as the sound, and I liked the 'Agent Carter' - featurette.This is more of a Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man movie, which is...interesting. On the downside, Tony isn't wearing his suit much. We see them a lot, he just isn't in them most of the time. That's pretty disappointing, but there's an upside: more Robert Downey Jr. When RDJ is not telling a forced joke, he makes a good one, and he owns this character right now as well as Harrison Ford owns Indy/Solo and Hugh Jackman owns Wolverine. He is a joy to watch and additionally handles more serious and emotional scenes very well too. Jarvis has a slightly bigger role in this, which I really do like. He's really a character here and Paul Bettany's voicework is excellent. And yes, I do like Gwyneth Paltrow. She's adorable. Don't agree with what they do with her character, but that aside, it's all good. Guy Pearce is at times just OK, but there are glimpses of him being pretty good too. Ben Kingsley...well, interesting to the very least and he delivers exactly what the filmmakers intended. Don Cheadle got some stuff to do in this film, which is nice. Shame that I don't care about half of it.This really is a weird one. Plenty of good, fun stuff and plenty of bad, forced stuff and negating some rules of Iron Man - universe. You can tell it's directed by a man who has made his living with action comedies. And I don't say that just as a lame insult: there are some pretty nice ideas, little tonal shifts to keep things 'fun' and the movie always keeps going forward with quite a pace. There's lot to like about Shane Black, after all I love 80's action movies far more than generic and shallow PG13-nonsense we get nowadays, and Shane Black has earned his credentials with good movies we still love today. So while he doesn't cater to the fanboys as much as I'd personally like, he does deliver a fun ride and overall a very nice movie experience.For me this could've been the best of all three IM movies, but it isn't. That said, it's easy to understand those who like this one the most. I don't regret buying it, and for me it's much, much more entertaining than Iron Man 2. The first one wasn't topped of course. I gave the first film a 9, IM2 got a very generous 6, so this one gets a 7.I'd advise approaching 'Iron man 3' not as a serious comic book adaptation, but just as an entertaining movie. As such, it does not disappoint. IM3 is certainly more enjoyable than the final movies in Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, the original X-men trilogy and Nolan's Batman trilogy. IM3 feels like a film you can watch a few times if you don't come to hate its shortcomings and questionable handling of source material too much. (edit: rewatchable indeed, watched it three times already)",7,1,2,30 August 2013
Gravity," Not so much a story as it is a ride.
","...and it's an impressive ride, I must say, but not much else.Be warned: In terms of story, there isn't much to this movie. Themes of sacrifice, loss, loneliness and belonging with even a couple hints at religion are certainly there, but if this same story happened in any other environment, you would see how average and dull it is. If you manage to suspend your hatred for shoehorned emotional elements and dialogue, they might spice up the experience and give enough emotional weight to what this movie really is - a simple survival film. A ride.Sandra Bullock is decent. Some people bring up the word 'Oscar' concerning her performance, but that's nonsense. She's just okay. It's hard to portray loneliness in space with little or no communication. I would've wanted the movie to totally nail this element. It didn't. Sometimes the script takes the easy route and makes our heroine talk to herself, spouting somewhat mediocre lines. Bullock is certainly decent, but doesn't deliver like Sam Rockwell did in 'Moon'. That's my gripe, and although not a small one, it's my only gripe. Luckily, Bullock didn't have to carry the movie alone. I'm not even talking about George Clooney (who is decent as well), but the environment. The view.Earth. I didn't even watch this in 3D at a theater (regular 2D blu-ray), but the view was stunning. It was immensely beautiful in a way that you can't help but to respect and admire. I almost felt like I was there myself. It didn't matter if it was an impressive camera drive in the middle of a hectic scene or just a calm, more still shot - our majestic planet and the surrounding vastness of space took my breath away. 'Gravity' uses this setting so well that it becomes its own character. I'm running out of compliments about the visual goods.The sound department. One thing I liked about '2001: A Space Odyssey' was how it managed to deliver powerful scenes without adding ridiculous sound effects to scenes that happen in space. There are no pew-pews, booms or bangs here either. The things we hear the most are silence, a character talking through a radio and music. There is quite a lot of music in this film. I feared it might take away from the atmosphere, but I found myself enjoying the powerful score.Special effects, as everyone probably already knows, are top-notch. From technical standpoint, everything is pure quality. This might be the best-looking movie I own, and it might be that for a long time to come.One more thing that I liked: 'Gravity' ends exactly like it starts. No unnecessary setting up nor aftermath, nothing to distract from the ride itself. The movie starts when the ride starts, and it ends when the ride ends. Just the essentials, nothing more. We don't get that enough nowadays.If you get bored very easily or if you have to have engaging or clever story lines, this movie might not be for you. Granted, I wanted a little more story, more natural characters and possibly some sci-fi elements myself too, but I have to judge this movie as it is - a simple but visually exhilarating survival flick. If you feel like watching an impressive ride in a majestic environment, then I can whole-heartedly recommend 'Gravity' for you.Not a masterpiece, but for a film with such a simple core, It's more than enough.",7,0,1,11 March 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Disney, you're losing me fast.
","I'll start on a positive note: 'Rogue One' is far better than it should be. There is no need for it to exist other than box office revenue, and the cynical corporate machinery behind it is quite obvious. This one should flat out suck. It doesn't. There are a few moments in it, it's very competently made, there is real talent involved and entertainment to be had. If you're not too critical about these movies, you'll have fun with it....But after just seeing it, I suspect that Gareth Edwards didn't get to make the movie he wanted or then he was just a yes man all along. 'Rogue One' could have been a really good standalone movie, but Disney had to interfere. They had to make everything feel 'more connected', so they sacrificed plenty to the altar of Cinematic Universe For Dummies. Many references and familiar elements/characters are shoehorned in just for brand recognition and everything suffered from it. This feels exactly like the Marvel superhero franchise is starting to feel: A product that exists only to remind you of their other similar products.The trailers had me worrying that the lead character/actress would be just a lifeless blank state. I was wrong, partially. The actress (Felicity Jones) is good. I know this, because at times she made me feel something, even when her character itself was paper thin. That would be alright if they didn't pretend she had a real arc or transformation as a person, but they did. That's the problem with forcing depth and moments where there are none: it feels undeserved, manipulative and cheap. I felt nothing for the character, but I felt something for Jones' screen presence - and that's a compliment, because when the mind-numbing laser show at the end begun, I just wanted to see more of her instead, along with Diego Luna.The same can be said for many of the characters: there are good actors involved that sometimes rise above their empty, toothless and pandering material. Ben Mendelsohn is great, even when his character has nothing going for him. Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera is pointless too - just a name, funny voice and a costume. A gimmick doesn't make a character. The more they tried to make someone appealing, the less appealing they became. Less is more, studio people. K-2S0 would have been fine without the forced quips too, but at least I felt something about them. This is not a spoiler, it's in the trailers: a certain famous character makes an appearance in the movie. And I must say that there was no point to it. The few last shots were alright, but there was a scene in the middle that served absolutely no purpose and felt extremely off. For the first time it felt like this iconic character was there just to deliver lines. It felt like product placement. Replacing Peter Cushing (deceased, RIP) with CGI was even worse. It was not only embarrassing, it was tasteless and disrespectful. There was no reason for it either, he too was in there for brand recognition only, and added nothing to the movie which makes it that much worse. It left a shitty taste in my mouth, just like the last shot of the movie in all its perverted CGI glory concerning a beloved character. Who the hell made these decisions?I noticed much of the cynical studio machinery behind 'The Force Awakens' as well, but I really liked that movie because it had genuine scenes. Real scenes with flow, deserved emotional stakes and purpose. 'Rogue One' doesn't flow at all. At the beginning we jump from one place to another, explaining various things to the point of boredom and disconnect, probably because they don't trust the audience to pick up the clues or understand hints to the past. Remember when the Jedis, clone wars and such are quickly mentioned in 'Star Wars' when Luke meets Obi-Wan? We picked up the clues then and let our imagination fly. None of that here, no room for imagination, no room for movie to shine. Shine it does, but in a wrong way: The last 30 minutes has plenty of space and land battles. Lights, lasers and explosions. No excitement, no natural flow, no reason to care. The ending also has three different scenarios happening at once, so we get plenty of transitions, plenty of unfocused fury and plenty of emotional disconnect. 'Rogue One' can't find a tone. It tries to be dark, and it kind of is, but it also pretends to have real emotion and humor in it - and only some of it works. It doesn't have a real heart, and in the end most of it just slips through your fingers.It tries to imitate the original trilogy. It succeeds only superficially. It captures the look, some (not needed) characters, references and such, but it doesn't dare to just be a movie. It's not comparable to the prequel trilogy either. While I think the prequels to be dumb, clumsy and emotionless, this one seems just cynical, manipulative and wrong in a whole other way. After all this complaining, do I hate it? Almost, but no. It is well made, the actors are mostly good, and technically it's fine. It just doesn't feel like a movie. It has no identity. It feels almost like a product forced on you by some condescending, pandering marketing people. It holds your hand at every turn in an uncomfortable way, and it has no real creative reason to exist. If you're already cynical about this movie, don't see it - it's exactly what you think. If you're excited, you'll probably like it. As for myself, I will skip all these 'cinematic filler universe' movies from now on.Oh, and Disney: It's okay for the boy and girl to kiss in the end. Especially when you have a movie that already lacks human emotion.",4,14,29,18 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Oh boy.
","This is a hard film to review. I still don't know exactly how I feel about it. I understand how this is a film so many have problems with and yet so many love it.I was never a die hard Trekkie, but I did enjoy much of the series (original and NG) and some of the movies. I kind of liked the 2009 Star Trek reboot movie. I gave it an 8, mostly because I liked the casting and it was good to see a Trek movie again. This, however, seems to be harder to swallow. The same things that make it good for some, make it worse for others. Two sides of the coin.These are the things I like: 1) The cast is still very solid, and adding the characters of Benedict Cumberbatch along with Peter Weller just screams casting quality.2) It's not boring, not for a second. It's paced like many films nowadays: plenty of action, humor and grand happenings.3) It looks really good.4) The overall story is good enough if you don't stop to think about it too much.--------------- These are the things I didn't like (the other side of the coin): 1) Casting aside, the main characters are written as simplified versions of the originals and to act a little out of character at times. This wouldn't bother me so much, if much of it wouldn't be cliché-ridden filler. It is true that the 2009 movie had simplified characters as well, but it's harder to forgive second time around.2) Even though the film isn't boring, it feels like it just pushes forward with haste, not giving the story/characters enough room to breathe and taking away from the dramatic potential the story had. Sometimes I felt I was watching a modern action-packed computer game. All of this takes away from the deeper layers of the story and there's really some stupid stuff crammed into the movie - 'just because'.3) While the movie looks good, I couldn't get over the lens flares. They're everywhere. Almost in every scene, tons of them. I don't even feel like I'm nitpicking, since this was clearly deliberate. Enough is enough.4) While the story is decent, there's a lot of stuff that's ripping off 'Wrath of Khan'. We already knew that, and it probably wouldn't be a problem if the rest of the story wouldn't feel lazy and cheap, much of which is recycled from the 2009 movie too. When you really think about the main plot and motivations/actions of certain characters, it stops making much sense. Lazy writing for a SciFi movie, decent writing for an action movie.That's it. I did somewhat enjoy the experience and I'll rate this a 6/10, but I also feel the waste of potential. The first movie surprised me 4 years ago. This on the other hand...while it's not bad, it feels disappointing, recycled, unintelligent and more of an action film where details do not matter than a movie worthy of the title 'Star Trek'. This is an action movie that happens to take place in space, not a SciFi movie at its heart. I don't consider myself to be a fanboy and I can often forgive many flaws in a movie (I gave 'Prometheus' an 8), but when the 'flaws' are products of deliberate choices from the production team and a side effect of modernizing every franchise into the same kind of pretty, expensive and easy mess, I'm certainly going to cry about it on the internet like a fanboy. Just like now!",6,2,4,13 November 2013
Spider-Man 2," Great sequel to the good first one
","*only minor spoilers ahead* This was basically a very well made flick. The first one built much for this one, and now we could see Spider-man controlling his powers better. From the start, you can see that the camera drives, the action, just about everything is great to watch.The spider-man humor is still there, as are Peter Parker's problems with school, life and girls. It all works well, though I can understand if someone doesn't like these aspects of the movie. But, it's pretty faithful to the comics and delivers some fun scenes, some relaxed scenes, and also pretty serious stuff, as Peter is still fighting with his conscience. It builds up the character nicely, and raises some real-life questions for everyone.OK, that's it. What about the action? Perfect! Spidey flies like he's never flown before, and the camera drives, acrobatics and stunts are just huge. Almost every little action scene has something truly innovative. I love some of the scenes when spider-man uses his web in many different ways, and he does that a lot - and that provides us some very good looking action. There are tons of different aspects of the action that can be praised. The scenes are just nothing short of impressive.The bad guy, starring Ralph Molina, does great. Dr. Octopus was always my favourite bad guy. As many things, he was not exactly like in the comics - and why should he be? It works for the movie very well.My only complaint is, that I would have loved to see more action. I'm not saying that there was too little of it, I'm just saying it was so good that I can't get enough of it.Also, the movie gets a little darker that the first one. And that's not bad.Sam Raimi has done to Spider-man what Bryan Singer to the X-men.Can't wait for the third one...if there is going to be things like Venom or the Sandman, it's going to be hard for Raimi to pull it off. Green Goblin and Doc Ock were at least scientifically explained, at least to a point. But as long as it's Raimi, we should not doubt much.",9,0,0,1 June 2006
Deadpool 2," Expected horrible, was OK instead.
","It's hard to follow a movie like Deadpool. The first movie wasn't a franchise film, it was clearly made with enthusiasm, and they had to fight the studio in order to make it. Deadpool 2 however is a big-budget sequel, a studio movie trying to follow the surprise success of the first one. The original director left the project, there were rumors of reshoots, and it felt like Deadpool 2 was becoming a parody of what the main character used to joke about.Not quite. This sequel is very entertaining. It's uneven, not on par with the first one, but it doesn't feel as calculated and soulless as I thought it would be. I'm as grumpy and cynical as they come, and even I giggled here and there. The main elements are there: Ryan Reynolds does his thing well, some jokes land, plenty of action, plenty of silliness and decent amount of blood too. There are some repeat gags from the first one, I don't know how I feel about them. The main issue with Deadpool 2 is that it struggles to hold on to what it is, and it often comes off as pretentious, especially when it was fiddling with some more serious themes or trying to tug our heart-strings. I witnessed some absolutely horrible lines from Ryan Reynolds, talking to a child character, about how much he cares about him. It happened two times. It was not a joke. The movie was trying to sell me the idea that Deadpool would care about some annoying kid. It was played straight, and it was like some horrible soap opera. The writing and execution was just horribly off for a movie like this. If anything, these kind of scenes with cheap, tacky emotional manipulation - especially concerning child characters - are what Deadpool should joke about, because we've seen it so many times, and it's almost always horrible and dishonest. In these scenes, Deadpool became a soulless movie for test audiences and focus groups, nothing else.Luckily, most of the time the movie works. It's not very smart, but it's coherent enough if you're willing to go along with the pace, and it's full of entertaining moments. Moments are what keeps this movie alive: it's never what the movie is focusing on, that alone will never do, but there are so many little touches here and there, in the foreground or in the background that kept me entertained. It seems like there were plenty of reshoots, or then they just didn't know how to use money, because some of the CGI shots looked unfinished. The action itself was alright, not anything great like in John Wick (same director, or one of them) which is a damn shame, but at least serviceable and well enough shot/framed. I consider most action movies with a lot of CGI to have boring action, so take from that what you will.To summarize, Deadpool 2, at times, feels like a mandatory focus-tested studio movie without much heart. The forced drama between Deadpool and the kid is absolutely horrible in how tone-deaf and pretentious it is, and the structure holds together just barely, but in the end it was a lot more enjoyable than it had any right to be. I cannot fathom how they'll do another one without the 'series' really becoming a parody of what Deadpool should be parodying. If more sequels come, I really hope that there is more serious inspiration and drive from the creators' part, and less about trying to please every damn focus group in the universe. This time though, the experience was still positive.",6,3,6,25 May 2018
X-Men," An example of casting and adaptation.
","X-men was the first Superhero-movie that made me go nuts. I mean, characters...Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, Mystique, Cyclops, sometimes even Storm (sorry Berry-haters) were just right. Just right! Just as right as Harrison Ford as Indy.That said, it doesn't take a lot more to love the film. But the plot is quite OK, and there are some truly innovative scenes. Xavier taking control of Sabretooth, Wolverine at the start and at the end with Mystique, Cyclops getting his glasses taken off...great stuff. Great. Also plenty of those little things that show how seriously Singer takes the original material.What this movie lacked, was given to us by X2. This was mainly a build-up - movie, and my god it worked well. Gotta love it.Singer is my idol.",9,2,4,31 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," A hard one.
","Spider-man has been my favorite hero since I learned to read (or even look at the pictures). Loved the first two, but this is something else.Like almost everyone says - too crowded. Too many things, plots and villains in one movie.It seems that I belong into some kind of minority, but I still think that Venom is a villain that should not be included in these movies. Maybe I got older at some point, I don't know, but I never liked the damn thing. Also I think that Venom is too out-of-this-world (even if it's supposed to be) and adds to the contrast in a wrong way.Anyway, Venom was handled in a manner that I can live with. Yes, it was rushed like everything else, but Raimi did his best. Hell, he didn't even want to include Venom into the movie. Sandman looks great, and you gotta love the shirt.With Venom, you get a few more sub-plots and nuances, and they all pretty much suck. You get a disco-dancing Peter wearing make-up and having to live through yet another identity crisis. You get the Sandman joining Venom in a (great-looking) final fight, thus losing every bit of character development he had so far. This was a shame, because Sandman was a good character, and he kept me interested to a point where his intentions and motivations are thrown to the trash, just because 'EPIC END BATTLE GUISE'.Now studios, if you have a franchise that does great, trust the director, listen to him. Raimi had a vision what he wanted this film to be, but NOOO, you just have to ignore him with some stupid ideas and make him deal with wrong and too many things in one movie. If I am wrong and this was the absolute best that Raimi could do and wasn't forced into any of the crap involved, then...well, at least the new Amazing Spider-man reboot succeeded.Raimi doesn't get 10 points for the effort though. Every laughable (in a bad way) part from the previous movies are nothing compared to the evil make-up-Peter. Come on Sam! So yes, there is a lot of nitpicking. But when the action kicks in, your jaws drop open and fall to the floor. You have never seen anything like this. The action, and how it's done, made me watch this movie several times. I don't do that a lot, especially with movies that make me complain this much. Maybe it's the kid inside me being happy, seeing his favorite hero in breath-taking movement and action, and being able to forgive many flaws.Worst of the three, but I think I'll be watching this many more times that the previous ones. Strange.",6,0,1,8 December 2007
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino might need a little restraint.
","...not on the violence and 'offensive' department necessarily, but structure-wise. It turns out that 'The Hateful Eight' doesn't really know how it wants to present itself. I saw the shorter version, the one that's 'only' 2hrs and 40min. I don't know how much tighter the longer version is, but I'll review what I saw.I do like the idea. People who seemingly have unexpected connections are trapped somewhere, and everyone seems to have an agenda. It's more like a classic murder mystery than a western, even if the tonal (or even genre) changes do come to play eventually.I know nothing about the cameras or film they used, but people seem to be making a big deal about it. Perhaps it is, and perhaps those wide interior shots were made possible with that stuff. But if you're looking for visual brilliance like 'The Revenant', you won't get it. Even though some scenery (especially at the beginning) looks nice, most of this movie happens in a cottage. That's not a flaw in itself, and this movie surely isn't poorly shot (quite the opposite) but I guess I was hyped up to see something else. Granted, my experience is based on the DVD I watched, which is probably the worst way to watch this one. I had no chance to see this in a theater with the setup this was meant to be seen.The structure is baffling. This movie is divided into chapters. Some chapters drag on and on. I like the dialogue, and the actors are fine, but it felt like I was binge-watching a short series. That alone isn't a big deal, but suddenly around chapter 3 or 4 (I forgot), you get a narrator. Suddenly the movie is narrated to you, and the storytelling methods change for a bit. At some point during the latter half, the movie skips in time and shows you the beginning before the end. While there is a charm to it, this type of stuff got me out of the experience. You're slowly lulled into thinking you're watching X, and then it changes into Y. Granted, it made things interesting in a different way, but I felt it happened at the expense of the atmosphere and tension.With great editing, this could have been a tight, engaging 2-hour movie. Instead it's wrapped in a long and choppy, sometimes even seemingly directionless form. That mess isn't horrible in itself, and I think that each different tonal or story segment is at least decent on its own, but without the straightforward ending I would have felt cheated. So what about the engaging end parts? Perhaps I'm just an idiot who can't appreciate fine details or narrative diversity, but the simple, brutal and engaging last segment heightened everything else that happened before it as well. Without the overblown bloody rampage the long, disjointed build-up would just be an experiment in story-telling and not much else. Yes, it gets violent and exaggerated. You know it's coming, and while I can see how Tarantino tried to make this movie into something else than just a violent, gruesome action piece, that same violent action was by far the most satisfying thing this movie had to offer.Almost the entire cast is very damn good, and the rest are 'just' good. Samuel L. Jackson is once again very captivating, even though I'm for some reason waiting for him to fail in these movies, as if all his good work was just an accident. Nope, he's very good. And while Walton Goggins seemed to be forcing his accent and mannerisms at first, he became one of my favorite actors/characters of this movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh was great from the start. Every time she was on screen she got me, and I think she gave the best performance of them all. Tim Roth is always a pleasure to watch, as is Bruce Dern. Kurt Russell was good enough, which is fitting. Everyone else was fine.In a long Tarantino movie, you're going to get tons of dialogue. Most of the dialogue is captivating. It seems to be mundane, but there always seems to be something happening between the characters, they're not just words for words' sake. There are many instances of the word 'nigger' in this movie. If you can't handle words like that, you can stay away. Then again, if you enjoy white men getting the short end of the stick, you could probably enjoy the scene where Samuel L. Jackson's character tells a story (in flashbacks) about thoroughly humiliating a white man. I don't know if it was some kind of political commentary, which I'd rather not have in a Tarantino movie of all things, but those kind of scenes managed to give the title 'Hateful eight' more weight. Everyone is a hateful, bad person in one way of another.The soundtrack did nothing for me. This is weird in a Tarantino movie. At times it even irritated me a little. I know Morricone is a master of his craft, and if I ever watch this film again, I will pay more attention to the score.In the end, I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie. It seemed to go nowhere at times, it couldn't (or didn't want to) hold its narrative on a tight rope, it's certainly very long, but the last 30-40 minutes made 'Hateful Eight' a positive experience for me. I don't know if I'll be seeing it again. I hope that Tarantino can get people in his crew to challenge him more, or a master editor at least. Recommended for tonal shift aficionados, narrative structure critics, 'people trapped in a house' - enthusiasts, story detail hunters and of course those who just like to watch people getting murdered like no tomorrow (but skip to the end for that).",7,2,6,6 August 2016
Alien," Possibly my favourite movie of all time.
","I decided to write a review for 'Alien', just for kicks. Perhaps some young people haven't seen it yet and might use some encouragement, but also because whenever I see this film, I can't stop talking about it. So here we go.This movie changed my life in the way it made me think about cinema. The experience I had as a 10-year old when I saw this, was something I can't put into words. I started to appreciate movies in a very different way. It was love, curiosity, admiration and fear at first sight.'Alien' is basically a monster/killer movie in space, but all the layers and phenomenal execution add so much to it. It seizes to be just a genre flick, and reaches toward something else. It is equally intriguing as it is scary. The sci-fi mystery elements are so powerful that even if it's not a thinking man's sci-fi movie, it makes your imagination soar in a way that only a handful of movies can achieve.Today, it has tons of sequels and as I'm typing this, it'll soon have its second prequel. The monster itself is almost a celebrity, and there is no escape from an overly commercialized franchise that has desperately been trying to capture what made the original film so great. However, they never managed to do that. Not even with James Cameron's 'Aliens', which has become almost a cartoon over time. It's still a very good action movie, but time catches up to every film. Except the original.Some movies stand the test of time. 'Alien' is one of them. It's just as amazing today as it was back in the day. This is not just nostalgia talking. Every set, every matte painting, all the props, all the robotics/animatronics and effects are absolutely beautiful (except for one and just one shot). Not only do they hold up today, but they have originality to them. When you add beautiful cinematography by Derek Vanlint and the visual direction of Ridley Scott, you get a ridiculously gorgeous film. You get real imagination, real craft. Something that makes you wonder. No mass-produced CGI, no executive-driven soulless copycat designs, no cookie-cutter execution, none of it. Even the atmospheric music stands out. It's all so great, and so very real. Talking about real, the actors are fantastic. 'Alien' does what almost no movies can't seem to do anymore (and what none of its sequels did after it): the characters feel like real people. These are not celebrities reading lines, these feel like real working-class people, basically truckers in space. Every single one of them is amazing, no need to mention specific names. The whole cast is spectacular, and nobody had an ego. If someone did, it certainly doesn't show. The natural performances keep you invested in every scene. All of it is held together by the well-written dialogue.Today, we're well aware how beautiful and disturbing H.R. Giger's Alien design is. In this movie, it's the best it has ever been. It's mysterious, it's ominous, it's strangely beautiful. It's not a video game monster running at you, because at times it just...seems to mind its own business, doing whatever it does. It feels real too, not just the people. When you add the magnificent sets, props and lighting/camera tricks, you can't help but immerse yourself.The amount of memorable scenes is absurd. You don't remember them because someone said a funny one-liner, but because they genuinely impressed you, whether you noticed it at the time or not. Not only all the pieces work, they elevate each other. I can't help but think that some happy accidents had to take place, since nobody knew they were making a masterpiece for a genre that was considered mostly trash. Lightning in a bottle? Perhaps.This is Ridley Scott's best film. 'Blade Runner' takes the second place. After that, he hasn't directed a masterpiece. Even 'The Martian', although critically acclaimed, is just a formulaic popcorn movie with very little cinematic value when compared to these two. Perhaps he won't direct any more masterpieces in his life, but even if he didn't, he directed this. For which I'm thankful. 'Alien' made me really love movies. And after just watching it for the 30th (estimate) time, I'm still in love with it.If you're young and generally suspicious of old movies, but still interested in this, it's time to step down from that fence. It's time to watch this classic. If you're old and somehow missed 'Alien', return to the past with this masterpiece, and you'll remember why things indeed were better then.",10,1,2,26 April 2017
Suicide Squad," Almost like a 2-hour long music video collection.
","I know nothing about Suicide Squad as a property, so I can only compare it to other movies in the genre and of course movies in general. Zero emotional investment beforehand can sometimes reward you.'Suicide Squad' feels like a movie that could've been many things, but ended up being almost nothing. There are many glimpses of engaging and good ideas or moments, but they all seem to drown under meaningless noise, montages, flashbacks and a playlist consisting of some classic rock songs along with some more modern stuff. I thought I would like the soundtrack and the score based on the trailers and some songs choices, but I ended up hating it. It's used in all the wrong ways and it took me out of the movie more than anything else. One song ends, another starts, and it's not organic or skillfully woven to the story. It feels like a cynical effort to be a part of some trend instead of serving any real creative purpose.Tones can shift and that's alright, it keeps things interesting. But here, almost everything is forced. You can be in the middle of a scene, and out of the blue you get a cheap, emotionally manipulative tonal shift that breaks the focus. It doesn't feel natural. Every time this movie tries to make you care, it tries really hard. You can ever hear it: If it tries to make you sad, the music goes to ULTIMATE SAD. If it tries to make you excited over a boring action scene where faceless demon cronies get bullets and fists to their face, the music goes to ULTIMATE HEAVENLY BATTLE MUSIC. Absolute overkill. Sometimes the score doesn't even seem to know what the movie is showing. The composed score in itself would be alright, possibly even very good if used differently or in a whole other movie.Technically, for a PG-13 action fantasy movie, 'Suicide Squad' is decent. It's shot well enough, and it's fluid in its own way. It's mostly dark, shot at night or in dark locations, which is fitting but executed in an almost dull way. At some points the cinematography looks nice. Many stylized 'cool shots' are there. Special effects are good at some parts, and the camera held its own in action scenes. Still, I felt nothing watching the action. It was competent and visually not horrible, but there was an emotional disconnect like in a music video; something technically good might be happening, but it feels vacuous and empty. It didn't have weight to it, no matter how many shots were fired. I liked watching the other stuff more. It's hard to say anything about the writing. They had tons of material, some good ideas and a few interesting character moments but nothing connected into an exciting, tight story. A few times when there was a flashback, I wanted to see those stories instead of the one I got. It wasn't that hard to follow, but it was scattered. I failed to see the beating heart of the story. The villain didn't get me excited, and many lines were just 'lines' instead of real dialogue. It's hard to say anything about Ayer's directing either, because I don't know how much control he had over this movie. I'll give him this though: the movie was very fast-paced and economical in the way all of the information was dumped on the audience. It's bound to be that way with so many montages and snippets, but at least it didn't all fall apart. I can only imagine what the result would have been with little to no intervention from studio execs who just have to have their slimy hands all over these movies. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are the leads. Will Smith is charismatic enough that he didn't even need to act, he was just casually throwing lines around, and that was enough. Robbie is the one who put up a performance, becoming Harley Quinn. She is just the right kind of mixture of sexy, cute, crazy, quirky, dangerous and vulnerable. She even sold me on one of those emotionally manipulative scenes, when everything around her didn't. She had plenty of horrible lines, but managed to rise over her material. Her outfit is the most colourful of the entire cast too, so naturally the camera loves her in a movie where everything is dark. Take Robbie out of the movie, and you got nothing. Kinnaman, Davis and Hernandez were decent, I guess. The 'Killer Croc' made me cringe a couple of times. They wasted a really charismatic actor for that?About performances, I didn't like Jared Leto's Joker. Almost every moment felt pretentious, forced and the wrong kind of insane. As if he was playing a drug addict doing crazy villain impressions. I like Jared Leto, but if this was his idea, then someone should have said something. I doubt Leto was in control though. I know that the Joker was supposed to be just a side character, and he was. Nevertheless, it felt like a poker game where they didn't have much of a hand, but they still wanted to overplay their hand each time he was on screen. To summarize, 'Suicide Squad' tried too hard. If it ever had a voice of its own, it was butchered by studio executives and a scattered structure. It felt like a collection of music videos. Not only because of its soundtrack, but also how the story was handled. You get glimpses of something, then it's over, and another tune begins. In the end, almost nothing stuck with me and I felt quite numb, bored and exhausted. That said, this can still work as a popcorn movie, especially if you care about this property and characters. It's technically sound, fast-paced, packing some good short moments and Margot Robbie is good in it. That much you'll get, but not anything beyond that.",4,3,6,6 August 2016
Shutter Island," Excellent. See it more than once.
","Before I go any further, I have to say that I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. I'm one of those people who love books and movies concerning mental disorders, ghosts, mysteries, one's personal demons and of course jails. So of course this movie seemed like a dream come true for me. My friends recommended this one, although I still would've watched 'Shutter Island' even if they hadn't. I thought Shutter Island could be like a combination of Jacob's Ladder, the Ring, Shawshank Redemption and...bunch of other movies. I think I was only 15% right, so don't be alarmed if you don't like the movies I mentioned.We all know who's the director and which actors play the major roles. They deserve all the praise they get, and hopefully even the last DiCaprio-hater will look him-/herself in the mirror after this. The whole crew working on this film pulled through. Everything is in place and handled with care. The location is beautiful and cinematography is excellent. Script is tight, every actor does a good job. Sound and music are masterfully done, and I admit shedding a tear or two listening to the end credits-song. I could write a thousand lines about this, so I'll keep it short: simply great work by great professionals, great work indeed. If you haven't seen this movie yet, try to avoid any spoilers if possible. The movie lasts well over 2 hours, but I found myself wanting more after the end. I could easily watch a 4 hour version of Shutter Island, and it would still feel like an hour or two. That being said - even if the film is relatively long, it doesn't have a boring or useless moment. Not one, not even for a second, and I'm hoping for an extended DVD-cut to be released. One can always hope.The story has layers, and of course some twists. The twists are never stupid, forced or too over-the-top to destroy the first 120 minutes you have seen. You may, like I did, guess what eventually is going to happen and what everything means. That is not a bad thing and I think it's intentional. I even watched it again soon after finishing it and then I really noticed the amount of detail this film had in it. This film is not all about 'the twist'. The story was interesting to the very end, and hopefully makes you see it again like I did. I felt really rewarded the second time around.There aren't much cheap scares, this film doesn't treat its viewer as an idiot. Scorsese doesn't work that way. He doesn't need to throw monsters behind your back to create this kind of gripping atmosphere. That little eerie feeling of suspense, it's always present. Main focus, of course, is on DiCaprio's character, whenever he's interacting with others or just following the trail of the mystery...or just dealing with his demons. We see everything through his character, and this approach works beautifully.Luckily for us, there are still people that, when brought together, simply cannot make a bad movie. This is an instant classic for me.",10,0,2,2 September 2010
Pacific Rim," Sit back and let 'Pacific Rim' punch your inner critic to sleep.
","I have finally seen this. Got this on blu-ray after the long wait (took some time to be released in the nordics). At first, I thought that there were so many clichés that it would bother me. And it did to some extent. At first, I thought I've seen all these characters before. And I had. At first, I thought the CGI looked silly (hadn't seen the good parts yet) at times. I thought the soundtrack was vapid. I don't know where in the movie exactly I lost all my gripes and negativity. Possibly when I saw A GIANT ROBOT BEATING A GIANT SEA MONSTER IN THE HEAD WITH A GIANT THING (won't spoil it for you). Even the soundtrack got me excited after everything 'clicked'.Throw your inner critic and inner hipster away to a fiery pit, and embrace this movie as what it is: 'Pacific Rim' is a pure B-movie and an epitome of power fantasy with phenomenal execution. Remember the old monster/mech movies of the good old times? The ones you'd catch on TV or find from some VHS video store? At its heart 'Pacific Rim' is exactly like that, only with a huge budget.Now when I think of the characters, I love how many stereotypes they managed to fit in. We got a Jaeger pilot with a painful history and a personal loss, a dickhead hotshot pilot, a wise older pilot, an excited wannabe pilot, a commander, two funny scientists...it's hilarious. And in a good way. We see overused characters and relationships and for some magical reason, it isn't a bad thing. There's enough story and characters to give a reason for what is happening with some fitting humor as well. I thought Charlie Hunnam was just OK, never been a huge fan although I do enjoy 'Sons of Anarchy'. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was decent as well. For me the best performances came from Idris Elba who has a magical presence as well as Ron Perlman who is always a joy to watch. Whatever tired lines they may spout, I'm all in and I buy it every time. Max Martini was also one of the more charismatic actors here.But the real characters...we know who they are, don't we? The Jaegers and the Kaiju(s). In laymen terms: GIANT ROBOTS AND GIANT SEA MONSTERS. And they are truly gigantic. Call me childish, but when I saw these 'main characters' fighting each other, I was giggling, cheering and pumping my fists with my mouth open. The designs are wonderful, full of personality. Every Jaeger and Kaiju is beautiful and exciting to look at.And the action itself...I don't know what to say. I mean, I've seen every 'big' movie there is. I've seen some special effects in my life. But this was phenomenal. I'm at a loss for words. Everything was big and badass, got more big and badass, and even more big and badass than I could've hoped. And the fact that most of the huge battles happen in water just makes everything look that much cooler. The water effects are amazing and the setting really adds a wonderful touch to everything that happens. The sea, the rain, the lights of Jaegers and helicopters...it's like a beautiful, fantastic and violent dance. There is so much attention to detail, so much expression with angles, colors and light that I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it in huge-scaled fantasy action movie before. The more I watch it, the more I'm impressed. Visually, eleven out of ten. Let's get some tired comparisons out of the way. This is not Transformers, even though both have giant robots. That's where the similarities end. Also on the huge-scaled action department, what 'Transformers' didn't do right for me, this film really did. Same with the horrible 'Battleship', it annoyed me as a whole more than it did anything else. This movie on the other hand got me. Guillermo Del Toro does love this genre, and it really shows. There is a heart in this film. It's a childish heart, but it's also an honest heart. Without that certain love and respect for the old pioneers, 'Pacific Rim' wouldn't have been this impressive. Luckily it is.No false pretences here, no shoe-horned subplots that serve no purpose, no political messages either. Only giant creatures punching each other to death in a war of two worlds, and a satisfying ending on top of it. 'Pacific Rim' is possibly the most expensive B-movie ever made. And for me it is worth it. Thank you for this, mister Del Toro. My inner child is still giggling like an idiot. He certainly got his fix.",8,5,7,5 December 2013
American Sniper," Review of the movie, not of any realities or politics surrounding it.
","This is a movie about Chris Kyle, a sniper and a navy SEAL, famous for ridiculous amounts of confirmed kills. 'American Sniper' is based on Kyle's own autobiography. And that is all this movie is. Some things are bound to be more dramatized for the movie for narrative's sake, some things probably left out for the same reason, and it certainly isn't preaching about politics. It's the first war movie for a long time where ham-fisted political commentary is not present. So I take it for what it is, instead of whining about what it isn't.'American Sniper' is a thoroughly well-executed movie. It's confidently directed, well-shot, well-paced and well-acted. It works. It never fully reaches its potential, but then again it's never bad.This story isn't told in 'acts', but 'tours' instead. Build-up at the beginning doesn't waste any time, and after that we get so see the four tours in order. After every tour, the main character Kyle (Bradley Cooper) spends time at home, finding it difficult. Every tour gets easier for Kyle in the battle with his brothers in arms, but harder at home with his wife and children. This flow or the narrative works surprisingly well.There is a simplistic 'rivalry' going on throughout the film. It feels like some old-fashioned revenge-based action movie at times, where the main character just has to beat the 'final boss'. I can't say I hate it, since it tightens the movie at some level, but I can't say I love it either. Anyway it's there, it works, but I can't help but feel the artificial nature of it. I wasn't there (in Iraq) though, so I can't complain about it any more than that, nor can I pretend to know what really happened.There is a sense of PTSD awareness in this film, and I applaud 'American Sniper' for that. But herein lies the biggest disappointment: it's not examined nearly enough. For the movie to strike that really powerful chord, PTSD in all its ugly glory should've been more of a focus and dramatized. We get plenty of hints and good, subtle moments, but never the scene that really pays off. Then again, this might have been the case with the book too, I don't know.Cooper is very good, and gives a somewhat subdued performance. Everyone else is at least okay, even though sometimes the other characters might come across as cardboard cutouts. Sienna Miller is good as Kyle's wife, even though her role is just that and not much else, and Keir O'Donnell equally good as Kyle's brother with his limited screen time.And even though Cooper is good, I would've wanted to know the character better. There is a certain disconnect, I'm not entirely sure what he's about. Perhaps the book didn't paint that picture either - and autobiographies can't always be trusted if that was or wasn't the case - but I would've liked to care more. When the movie isn't about the war itself, it's important to fully flesh out the character. I understood the character, that wasn't the problem, but I wanted the movie to go so much deeper. It didn't.It's a Clint Eastwood movie, so don't be surprised if you're not being preached to. Many people seem to take this movie as jingoistic preaching though, simply because it refuses to put down the troops and also because it doesn't shove a political message in your face like every other war movie nowadays. Perhaps it's not politically correct, and perhaps it only deals with the book, not with all realities and events that might have taken place. There is some patriotism involved, which in itself should not be a bad thing. I do not hold these things against this movie, and I certainly don't expect movies to educate me or pander to me. I expect them to tell a story from whatever viewpoints they choose, and if something gets me interested, then I will find out more and do my own research.To summarize, 'American Sniper' is a good movie. It doesn't reach the heights of a great movie because there is a certain disconnect concerning the lead character, and the PTSD elements aren't dramatized enough to my liking. But as it stands, it is good. If you are a person who pukes at the sight of patriotism, then you might not like it. If you are a person who demands sensitive subjects handled from all viewpoints and politically dissected whenever possible, this might not be for you. For everyone else, I recommend this movie. Take it as it is: as an adaptation of an autobiography, adapted by people who know their craft.",7,0,11,1 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More entertaining than Phantom Menace, but worse as a film.
","Yes, this is going to be another prequel-bashing review and yes, almost everyone has already seen this. I can't blame the people who like these films though. I did too, at first. The power of denial was so strong. And who am I to judge, because I actually like plenty of movies that are flawed to the bone marrow. But let's get into this.Episode II showed me that Lucas really doesn't know what is great about Star Wars. It's baffling, and I can't get my head around it. It almost makes it seem like the original Star Wars in 1977 was mostly an accident, and that it was miraculously saved by convenient troubles in production and the power of editing.'Attack of the clones' is not only a misleading title (because the movie is about a horribly forced love story and convoluted space politics), it's a space opera that doesn't know how to be a space opera. Excitement is replaced by shiny CGI lights, story is replaced by a bunch of contradictions and forced pathways to make A happen before we get to B, and characters are replaced by confused actors reading lines in front of a green screen.Many people have said that Hayden Christensen is bad. Well, he is, but I can't blame him. A better actor could have made something better out of the material he had, but the stink of feces would still be all over said material and it would translate to the audience. Natalie Portman doesn't do well either, and these two 'main characters' have zero chemistry together. Every scene they share is an abomination, and should be studied by everyone who is getting into film-making, writing or acting - as a preemptive measure.Ewan McGregor and Christoper Lee on the other hand are alright, mainly because they can't make any movie worse. Whenever Christopher Lee is on the screen or these two share a scene, it's actually enjoyable to watch.This movie has more action than Phantom Menace, which makes it slightly less boring. It's also even less coherent, but we weren't paying attention to the needlessly complicated and badly written space politics anyways (because thinking about it is highly dangerous to one's health). Yes, several questions are raised that are never ever answered, but at least we get tons of lightsabers. Weee! Sadly, the excitement is often butchered by the weightless nature of the scenes, but at least we can look at bright lights once in a while before we start to bleed out of our noses. Even if the wise, old and lovable master Yoda gets reduced to a lightsaber action man, which is a horrible thing, there were two short action pieces I actually liked and McGregor was involved in both of them. You know which ones I'm talking about.John Williams' music is always great, no debate there. Props to the sound department too, this is a movie that caresses your ears, when people aren't reading their lines out loud. I have no more compliments.This movie is about telling, not showing. What it tries so hard to tell us, it can't deliver. The love story doesn't work, at all. The politics are bad, convoluted fanfiction. Most of the action is weightless, and the story has no focus, no real natural dynamics. If there was a gold heart inside of this mess, I would forgive many of its shortcomings. I see no such heart.I know I'm a bitter bastard. It's hard for me to see this movie as just its own thing, to let go of my grievances and try to enjoy the little good things it has to offer. It's hard, because I see all of it as one mess: not only the prequels themselves, but Lucas' brain farts concerning all the changes he made into the original trilogy to suit the prequels and his supposed 'original vision' that keeps changing time and time again, and always for the worse. The shadow of this machinery is tainting so much of what I love. Gladly there are some HD fan edits of the original trilogy around, so they can still live in their former glory - at least for those of us who don't have the VHS tapes.I don't know how to feel for the younger people who had their first Star Wars experiences from the prequels. On one hand I'm sad for them, because these movies could have been so much more, they could have been full of that movie magic I witnessed in the early '80s. On the other hand, they will not be bothered by the special editions of the original trilogy, because it will be all be new for them, and they won't have to turn into cynical bastards who complain about space movies on the internet. If you are one of those younger people, and you can enjoy even these prequels with a pure, childish heart, I envy you.Oh, and The Force Awakens is out. It's simple, exciting and enjoyable as these movies should be, so the kids - as well as us old farts - can still see a Star Wars movie in a theater that actually has a heart and bits of that movie magic.",3,1,7,1 January 2016
Predator," 'It was an echo'
","Another title that everyone's seen which I just had to review. But why not? This will always be a new movie for someone. First time I saw it - in VHS format - I was about 12. Now I watched it on blu-ray, so here goes.One of the best action movies of the 80's and it doesn't even feel like an 80's movie too much. A true pioneer, introducing us a fantastic, all new alien species and quite a few memorable scenes, characters and of course some one-liners from Arnold.The jungle is an excellent environment, and it's used well. Cinematography and camera-work is usually very impressive. The story is clever enough and moves forward at an enjoyable pace. There is action, suspense, comic relief and of course sci-fi all mashed into one unforgettable movie in a manner that is hard to surpass. This movie starts just 'okay' but gets better with each passing minute, climaxing wonderfully in the end. There are no significant flaws for me.Before I get to the 'little disappointing' things, I'll list some things I love about 'Predator':<ul><li>Location. The jungle isn't only 'cool', it also serves the movie well in a way that still feels fresh and ageless. Imagine if this film was set in a city in the 80's. </li></ul><ul><li>The Predator itself. Not only how it looks (good), but its behavior, background, the whole concept. It is a real character, not just an enemy in an action film.</li></ul><ul><li>Arnold. I can't help it. He's the most entertaining action hero ever.</li></ul><ul><li>Muscles and guns everywhere! The whole commando squad is a well-cast, enjoyable group of different personalities.</li></ul><ul><li>Satisfying violence. PG-13 just wouldn't cut it. </li></ul><ul><li>Jesse Ventura with the 'Old Painless'. Yes, this had to be mentioned separately.</li></ul><ul><li>The awfully hilarious female genitalia-related jokes. </li></ul><ul><li>1st, 2nd and 3rd act are all wonderfully different from each other, yet somehow still fit together as a whole.</li></ul>Now, to the nitpicking. Sometimes the editing is a little off to me. Only a few scenes where it's noticeable, but it sticks out a little. Sometimes during intense action the 'big picture' gets lost and it feels like people are just running wherever and explosions just happen without much established geography, and that takes just a little out of the experience for me. The effects, well...most of them have survived the test of time. Quite an accomplishment. Some effects still look very cool. Some of them sadly don't and I was taken out of the movie at times, but after 26 years that's more than understandable. But if someone's reading this and hasn't seen this movie, don't be discouraged. You'll love it, and you'll find plenty of stuff here that you won't find from the majority of action films today.The blu-ray picture quality is surprisingly good (I got the 'Ultimate hunter edition'), considering how much they had to do. There are a couple of shots that are not re-mastered for some reason, but they're only 2-3 seconds long each and didn't bother me that much.I was about to give this a score of 8/10, because I might've just seen this movie too many times to fully appreciate it anymore. Then I slapped myself in the face immediately. If I had a Top10 list of action movies, 'Predator' would be in it. For the originality, overall quality, certain agelessness, pure entertainment value and also nostalgic value it gets a respectable 9/10. Truly a classic. If you ever meet someone who says 'Predator' is his/her favorite movie, do not think you're dealing with an idiot. You just might be dealing with a genius of the highest caliber. Not bad for John McTiernan's first big studio film! McTiernan's next movie after this was 'Die Hard', not a bad combo.",9,1,2,20 September 2013
Oblivion," Sometimes I like my sci-fi exactly like this.
","I read some bad reviews about Oblivion, but decided to have a go with blu-ray anyway. Just watched it.Very positively surprised. I like how the movie takes its time. I didn't think it dragged at all, I like to have some room to think and immerse myself. And immerse myself I did. I thought I'd get an average movie experience, but this is one of the best big SciFi movies I've seen in years. 'Moon' and 'Prometheus' are the other ones, though one could argue that 'Moon' isn't a big film in itself and 'Prometheus' is weakest as a whole.Yes, Oblivion has elements and themes that we've already seen before. It doesn't invent anything perfectly fresh. It reminds me of 2-3 other movies very much. I'm not naming those movies though, this is best to be seen without any spoilers beforehand if at all possible. Even though the themes are not original, they work well and the movie feels it's set in its own world. Not only do the themes work well, but they are important and ageless. I managed to suspend my disbelief and dive into the movie, and I was rewarded. This isn't to say that the movie is sloppy or nonsensical, although many people will have problems with some things. What I mean is that there's much detail to every scene. I don't only mean props, continuity or stuff like that, but that every scene is crafted carefully and and has a purpose. I will compliment the ending too. Not necessarily in a 'it's brilliant!' manner, but the movie made me feel there was a real payoff. It builds itself up well, holds itself together and ends in a powerful way. The ending was intense, emotional and absolutely satisfying. So I liked the general plot, themes and pacing. How does it look? It looks brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Those of you who have Prometheus on blu-ray: yes, this is equally stunning. I admit some designs lack imagination and many things are too 'clean' as if futuristic surroundings would always be white, clean-cut and sterile, but you forgive that. This is eye-candy, this is eye-steak. Also, if you have a symmetry-related OCD, you'll appreciate Oblivion. For some reason I noticed symmetry everywhere.Everything seems to have its rightful place. And here I will also compliment the wonderful music: when everything works and flows well on the screen, you can easily concentrate your focus on the beautiful score too.Tom Cruise is a strange man. I would love to hate him for his scientology crap, but almost every time he entertains me with his movies. Many times he's just so solid. He's solid again. Not anything Oscar-worthy, but he does deliver as well as we've grown to expect. Beautiful Olga Kurylenko's character is one I would've liked to have developed a little more, but she gives a pretty good performance. Andrea Riseborough is excellent and in my mind delivers the best acting in this movie, establishing that certain important contrast with the main character. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman. That is enough.Except for a couple of short scenes, there are usually only 2-3 people interacting with each other at once - often with just communication devices - and I like it. It creates that weird feeling of intimacy in a vast, open world. For some reason I'm reminded of 'Collateral', where Cruise and Jamie Foxx kind of have a huge city just to themselves.In some ways, this movie is like Prometheus for me, Oblivion being a little better as a whole. Both are a little flawed in their own ways, but still fascinating and captivating in a way that's very hard to accomplish. Add brilliant visuals and an effective soundtrack into the mix and you got yourself an interesting ride. I think I had the perfect state of mind for this movie, I'm still surprised how much I liked it.I do believe that in time, 'Oblivion' will be a cult classic. There was so much wonderful talent involved in almost every possible aspect that I could almost sense their love for filmmaking as an art form.Joseph Kosinski did a really wonderful job and established himself for me. Really looking forward to his work from now on.",8,13,17,20 August 2013
The Bourne Identity," Still one of the best action thrillers.
","'Bourne identity' is not only a good movie, but it's easily the best Bourne movie I've ever seen. Granted, I don't recall much of the Chamberlain Bourne from 1980's, but out of all these new ones (including 'Bourne legacy') I clearly like this one the most. Here are the reasons why:1) This is easily the most emotionally appealing Jason Bourne out of all three of this trilogy. There is more depth and sincerity in his struggles, and he isn't yet too seasoned and determined as he is in the sequels. Matt Damon gives a very good performance.2) This movie focuses on the essential. It isn't trying to be smarter than it is. This isn't a movie about CIA spy programs and conspiracies as much as it is about Jason Bourne. This approach makes the movie more relatable, more exciting and more effective in every way.3) Wonderful cast. Casting was never a problem in the sequels either, but I like the actors in this one the most. Clive Owen, Chris Cooper, Franka Potente. Good job from each and every one of them.4) Execution. I love most of the scenes in this movie for two reasons: they are just long enough to tell you that certain part of the story and maintain the suspense - never longer. When there's action, it's not only exciting but you actually see what's happening. Example one: confrontation with Clive Owen's character. It doesn't really take that long, but it's effective and suspenseful from start to finish. It doesn't get tedious or repetitive and it tells you every bit of the story you need to know. Maximum effectiveness. Example two: the fight scene in the apartment. It's inventive and exciting, but not only that: you see what's going on. While the sequels went a little crazy with the shaky-cam, this one includes enough shots from steady, different angles to a) keep you in the middle of the action and b) let you see the big picture as well. This is easily one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even if the sound effects are a little overblown. 5) Violence. I'm not a gore fan, but these are not (nor should they be) kids' movies. Some of the action really has an impact on you. When someone gets hurt, you feel it.That's pretty much it. This is simply an effective movie: it's paced perfectly, the cast is wonderful, action is thrilling and the more personal focus on the main character seals the deal. The sequels never came even close. They're not as bad as their hideous visual style (Greengrass hates my eyes), but they chose the path of messier and less appealing storytelling, tedious action and general shallowness. Soundtrack-wise the sequels got the upper hand in my mind, but that's it. I'm not exactly a fan of director Doug Liman, but he did such a fine job with this film and I would've wanted him to direct the sequels too.I'm writing this review now, because I just got this movie in a blu-ray format (universal 100th anniversary something edition) and I thought I might as well write a review, even though I've had this film on DVD for many years. I'd like to compliment the product itself: this is how blu-rays should be made. Straight from the menus you know that there's been some effort. Plenty of stuff, bonuses and extras too.",9,0,1,13 September 2013
Man of Steel," Looks good, but lazy and messy as a whole.
","Going without spoilers here, just because there might be a couple people left who haven't seen this.I'm not a fan of Superman myself, and although he's more of a concept than a character, I can appreciate what Superman stands for. I remember liking Richard Donner's Superman movie quite a bit, and I think it hasn't been topped.From the beginning, it's clear that this isn't a fun movie. It tries to be as serious as it possibly can. I don't like the choice, but I can go with it. If you're going to make a super-serious Superman film, you're going to have to do it right.Instead, as a film, 'Man of Steel' is clunky. Things happen because the script demands it, and much sense goes out of the window. Many characters and the actions they take are just plot/exposition devices and only some of it felt natural to me. That takes me out of a movie, and usually gets me angry at the overall laziness of the story. I won't blame the actors, because even Amy Adams (not fond of her that much) manages at times to bring even a little life to her badly handled character, and Shannon/Crowe/Costner I like in almost everything, in this one too, but mainly because they're Shannon/Crowe/Costner. Cavill is probably good enough, because playing a concept is hard and even though the film tries, he isn't given much to work with.The story is a bit of a shoddy mess, but the pacing in some areas is handled well. We get a lot of Krypton in the beginning which is a nice idea, and Superman's childhood is only referenced in several flashbacks, without forcing us to go that route again. This is funny though, because I wanted the movie to get the childhood-part over fast without dwelling in it, but those moments were the best this movie had to offer.So you don't get a naturally engaging story or natural characters as much as clunky script and exposition, but you do get a lot of action and power displays. If you're a fan of Superman's powers more than the character, you'll get a lot of good-looking destruction porn. If you think movies don't have enough action nowadays, you'll appreciate this one. You get tons and tons of action, destruction and chaos. And I admit, it's very cool to watch at first and the thumping soundtrack is all over the place....but because I'm getting old, the never-ending action gets boring quickly and the otherwise competent soundtrack felt like it was beating my head with 'BE EXCITED! CARE! CARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING! THIS IS WAR!' - emotion it tried to convey. First I had excitement, then I had just fatigue. Ultimately, I didn't care.What good did I get out of this movie? I got some good intentions. Focusing on Krypton at the beginning was a nice idea, handling the childhood in flashbacks worked for me too. Some moments, especially with Costner, I found to be good. Visuals - although with a too gloomy, 'serious' blue color palette - were outstanding. That's about it.Otherwise I got a mess full of convenient stupidities, unnatural characters I don't care about and another proof that a Superman-movie is hard to make. This one tried to go with a serious tone and tons of action, but when that's all you really got, you're just a notch over a Transformers movie. Those at least don't pretend to be deep.Richard Donner is still the boss. 'Man of Steel' is a completely joyless action movie that left me disconnected and tired. I can easily understand those that like this movie, but I couldn't bare to watch it again.",5,2,4,24 April 2014
The Revenant," Tries a little too hard, but it's damn impressive nonetheless.
","Revenant is a movie that almost everyone interested in it has already seen. So here's a useless review. I'll try to summarize my impressions in short, compact sentences.There's an eerie feeling of 'being there' when watching Revenant. The cinematography is majestic, and I would recommend seeing this movie for its visual excellence alone, because you don't have to be a film snob to appreciate the craft of cinema being displayed in a masterful manner like this. The setting - ruthless nature - is made to be hauntingly wide and cramped at the same time. It feels so impressive, so huge that it's about to swallow you. This is a good thing, and I loved the unnerving respect I felt towards it all.Leonardo Dicaprio won the Oscar for his performance. It's certainly not a bad performance, but Tom Hardy delivers the best acting of the bunch. Hardy is so good that I developed a newfound respect for the guy. I already liked him, but I didn't know he was capable of something like this. It's a shame he didn't get the academy award. He stole the show performance-wise, and it was most likely my favorite performance of the whole year. If you have seen this film, you know what I'm talking about.Dicaprio acts with his face and his groans. Throughout the movie, his character is suffering and surviving. I like how he's used here, because when he tries to do the accent (in the beginning of the movie), it's noticeable. I'm looking at the actor, not the character, and it takes me away from the movie. Because of that, it's a good thing to have Leo in a physical role for that reason alone. He does a fine job, and nobody can blame him for the lack of effort. However, it feels a bit forced at times. I shouldn't feel bored when I watch a character suffering, but at times I was. I know the movie is about suffering and overcoming extremely hopeless situations, but I could see the 'Oscar push' at times. Parts of this movie that included Dicaprio's character overstayed their welcome. That said, his performance is memorable.This isn't a deep movie story-wise. It's about surviving against all odds. It's about willpower and vengeance. We have seen this story many times in many forms, and while that's not a bad thing in itself, the story doesn't really grip you. If someone complains about a hollow story, I can't really disagree. Of course there are some cool things to spice things up: an interesting time period along with some (not really subtle) racial politics.There are a few artsy dream sequences which try to inform us about our main character and also give us some breathing room, because there's only so much we can handle constant suffering. They succeed in what they try to do - and they are also gorgeous to look at - but they don't fit seamlessly to the rest of the film. Revenant is a long movie, and it also feels like a long movie. I would have removed the dream sequences along with 10+ minutes of groaning, but then again, there is something impressive in every minute of it.This is a very violent movie. It's inherently brutal. It dances the fine line of being disturbingly violent without shocking the audience too much or throwing in gore just for the sake of gore. But If you are very sensitive to realistic violence, be warned. There is a scene involving a bear which is as stunning as it is horrifying. Yes, it's the scene you have probably heard about. I heard about it beforehand too, but nothing could prepare me for it. It was so well done, and I can't remember the last time I was genuinely shocked and awed in a movie theater like this.In the end, Revenant is impressive. It's a little hollow, it can be boring at times and it tries a bit too hard, but this is a movie about the details. It's about the craft of cinema, the art of film-making and what people still can do with it. Hauntingly beautiful cinematography, quality acting (especially from Tom Hardy), great camera-work and a few memorable, stunning scenes. When the details of a movie are handled like this, it's easy to forgive its faults.Recommended for everyone, except for small children and people with bear-related, traumatic psychological issues.",9,0,1,15 April 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," Romantic comedies suck. This does not.
","This film is much more than a romantic comedy (which is a genre generally consisting of steaming pile of crap), although it is that too. It's a wonderful mess of drama, comedy, romance, dialogue and a certain warm sense of honesty that at times seems to fall apart, yet never does.Mental health problems and a certain dark and brutal sense of honesty that can arise from such things are well represented here. It's never too hard on you (although I wish that it was), but it doesn't lose its honest touch either. Even if things are portrayed in a funny way and some corners are cut short, it keeps everything just realistic enough. I'm a nutjob myself, many hospitals, treatments and drugs behind me, and I appreciated the way these issues were handled. I heartily laughed at the scene where the main characters had a humorous discussion about the drugs they've taken.This film manages to avoid preaching. Even though mental health problems are dealt with, it isn't a documentary or solely a representation of mental illnesses and how to treat them, no. After all, it is still just a movie with a story to tell. And the story is a hilarious mess. We got a reconciliation theme, therapy sessions, sports, gambling, dancing contests and you name it. This should not make any sense at all, but it does. I managed to be surprised by about half the turns the movie made. However, if you're looking for a thrilling storyline or an engaging plot, you might be disappointed. It feels like a bunch of somewhat random scenes and events. These scenes are well tied together and the red line is constantly present, but if you judge it only as a linear story, it isn't that great.Bradley Cooper steals the show. He's fantastic, and by now it's certain that he's not just a pretty boy. Although 'stealing the show' might be the wrong term, since everyone else is good too. Jennifer Lawrence is very good, as is Robert DeNiro, and even Chris Tucker is alright. Imagine that.The screenplay is good and well directed. David O. Russell has a reputation of being an ass at times, but he sure knows his stuff. Now I'm curious about the original book too, I hope I can find it from my local library.It's not perfect though. After about one hour, the film seems to lose some of its magic and touch. It comes back eventually for awhile, but it still leaves a little stain on this otherwise great movie. I felt that some dramatic potential was lost during those moments.That said, I would recommend this movie for everyone. If you got mental health problems, marital problems, or ANY problems, you might enjoy the positivity this movie squeezes from serious subjects. The positivity is surprising and also rewarding, which is quite rare. You will also probably see something in these characters that you recognize. I recognized myself and many people in my life, many times.Hey, I feel good after seeing this. I missed this feeling.",9,1,3,30 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," McQuarrie and Cruise are a great pair.
","If I got it right, this was the fourth time when writer/director McQuarrie and Tom Cruise worked together on a film. While not all of them are great, none of them has been a disappointment. This one doesn't disappoint either.Christopher McQuarrie is probably my favorite Hollywood-type screenwriter. He's got a knack for telling a story very efficiently and surprising the audience without getting pretentious or using forced unnatural twists. To put it simply: he can convey a ton of information and forward several plotpoints in one minute without exhausting the viewer, while making all of it genuinely interesting and adding just enough unexpected humor. I was worried about McQuarrie's capabilities as a director though, as well as the fact that this series has seen too many sequels already. Those worries were put to rest. I still think McQuarrie is more of a writer, but it's certain he can handle directing as well. He knows the beats, has plenty of experience and for him the story comes first.While this series has seen so many twists, 'Rogue Nation' somehow manages to stay fresh. Cruise and McQuarrie are always reliable, but it certainly helps if they're not alone. Turns out that they aren't. I didn't like Simon Pegg that much in the previous movie, but I guess he grew on me, since he felt pretty natural this time. Jeremy Renner is always a very likable presence, and even Alec Baldwin managed to entertain me in a role I've seen him play so many times before. That said, Rebecca Ferguson is very entertaining as the female spy counterpart for Cruise and certainly stands out. She's not just a pretty doll for us to look at - even though she is pretty - but she fits the movie like a glove. Special mentions to Sean Harris and Simon McBurney, both were excellent casting decisions.So the cast works, as well as the script and directing. How about everything else? The movie is shot well. Many locations and sets (not only the grand ones) are interesting, well framed and lit. Cameras are used in an interesting manner, and the color choices were mostly pleasing to my eye. As far as the action goes, there are plenty of jump cuts as well as some hand-held cameras, but they knew what they were doing. All of it complements the movie instead of being a bunch of forced stylistic choices. This movie wasn't an assault on my senses (like the Bourne sequels were), and I could follow the action quite well. The action scenes are well designed and often wonderfully layered. I didn't love the music though. I know there isn't much room to differentiate from the classic score, so it did the only thing what it could do for me - not make me bored or annoyed. There was some use of opera I liked, and the pacing/editing of music was handled carefully.This isn't a perfect movie in every other way either. To keep up with the pace, many of deeper breathing moments for the audience and certain story clarifications are sacrificed. Not that I need to lose myself emotionally in a movie like this, nor do I need to have an explanation for every gadget or transition I see, but these things are sacrificed nonetheless. We don't get a thrilling masterpiece, we get an entertaining ride instead. It's a compromise I can live with, and most likely the only way these movies can work right now.Tom Cruise is a pro. It's hard to think of something to say that hasn't been said a thousand times already. He's committed, he's entertaining and he makes any movie better for being in it. Such is the case with 'Rogue Nation' as well. I just hope he remembers that he doesn't have to out-do himself with every movie on the stunt department, because he also has the ability to make the more quiet scenes work. Oh, and the blu-ray version has a good Cruise/McQuarrie commentary track. I always love it when the star and the director talk about their movie together with such enthusiasm.To summarize: 'Rogue Nation' is not a classic, but it is a fun, smart ride where everyone involved seems to give their very best. It's fast-paced, well-acted, well-written, well-shot and does what many summer action movies can't; it manages to be interesting even when people aren't running, punching and exploding - which in turn makes running, punching and exploding that much more fun.",8,1,3,6 December 2015
Spider-Man," Childhood hero in the screen does well
","*just a little of spoilers, if any* When I saw this, I had to see it 3 times in a row. That's a lot. I was just so excited about this. Spider-man (as well as X-men) was such a character, I spent years reading the comics and loving it.I must say this was done well. Spider-man wasn't so dark as Batman or X-men, and it shouldn't be, it has always been more relaxed-kind of thing with him. Peter Parker, basically a low-esteemed kid, problems with his civilian life, crushes on girls....you name it. Casting is good. Tobey Maquire is the perfect 'nerd' for the role, and he delivers it well. The humor was OK. Spider-mans humor, in the comics too, was really different from the other comics, and it was adapted to the movie pretty faithfully.Kirsten Dunst, well, M.J. was given a pretty different role here than in the comics, but hey, it works. J.Jonah Jameson - perfect! Aunt May - perfect! Green Goblin - perfect casting.There were taken some things that were changed from the comics, for example the web slings. Peter could sling web by himself in this movie, he did not need the wrist-machines. Which was OK, didn't bother.And well, the immersion of Spider-man flying around the city? Was done well. And I just loved the thing that Peter was still getting used to his new powers and not controlling them so much. Action scenes were good. Acrobatics, web slinging, camera rides - oh man.However, the Green goblin was a bit lame. It's just me, cause I don't like bad guys with ugly green costumes. That ain't the fault of the movie, just my own personal view about the several bad guys spider-man faced in the comics. Willem Dafoe was great though, I liked him.This movie was good, and did some building for the 2nd Spider-man movie. Sam Raimi really is a fan himself.",8,1,2,1 June 2006
Jarhead," A war movie with no plot - and yet good
","At first, it seemed that this movie was trying to be Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line and Platoon all at once. I was wrong, it wasn't simply trying to be anything else but an adaptation of Anthony Swofford's book. And it was fine. Never read the book, so I can't do comparisons.First of all, there is no plot, and probably even no agenda. It's simply a story. The scenes are powerful at best and generally well done, and they hold some space for the viewer to think about them, it's not just things happening with haste. As said above, It's not like the movie is trying to tell you something, it just tries make you feel and think. You can really put yourself into several characters' position at times - even though the characters never come close, and they feel a bit distant.You may think that when a movie has no strong plot, it may be just a confusing bunch of scenes, which have nothing to do with each other. This isn't the case - you get a clear grip on what's happening all the time and 'Jarhead' doesn't confuse its viewer.Visually 'Jarhead' is an impressive film. It looks somewhat like Black Hawk Down all the way - which is not a bad thing. There are some beautiful and stunning scenes. The burning oil wells making the sky black while the sun is trying to get through the thick smoke - beautiful and ugly at the same time. There are some dream-like scenes too and they serve their purpose.This is not a movie where everything explodes and everyone dies, quite the opposite. If you expect constant shooting and intense battles, you may not like this film. But hey, we've seen enough of those, haven't we? The strong parts of this movie are also the weakest - there is no plot, or no message at all. It gives the viewer a chance to replace him-/herself with the character(s) and experience everything in a certain personal way, but on the other hand it's not that rewarding in the end. Recommended. Not a war movie in a sense that we only get little or no battles at all, but...I'm just repeating myself here, aren't I? Try it yourself, you might appreciate it. I think this is one of those films for which you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy yourself.",8,1,2,12 June 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man," There's a lot of love in this.
","When I heard The Amazing Spider-Man is on the works, my first thought was 'why?'. After all, it hadn't been that long since Raimi's trilogy, and apart from the last one they weren't bad.Was this needed? Probably not. Which is funny, because it's still very, very good. I just watched it for the 2nd time on blu-ray and there's so much good in this film.The casting is excellent. Andrew Garfield is not just a good actor, he's far better Peter Parker/Spider-Man than I would've thought. He nails it. I really was surprised by it. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is equally good. I love it, that for once, Peter's love interest isn't a useless, idiotic damsel in distress with some trivial occupational/emotional problems nobody cares about. For once there's a female counterpart who isn't just an idiot, but neither a forced, overly strong woman with a bitchy character trying to portray some cynical girl power fantasy. No. Gwen Stacy is smart, funny and naturally likable character. Which can also be said of Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field). Warm, good characters, and the dialogue is usually good and/or well delivered. For once, I'm happy that characters aren't a) stupid or b) repulsive. It's clear that with this reboot, Marc Webb not only wanted to tell the origin story again, but he wanted to do it right. Although basic aspects are the same as in previous trilogy, there are differences here and there. I complimented the dialogue. I'll also compliment the pacing. Sometimes corners are cut a little short, and the character of Connors/Lizard could've used a little more character development, but the movie just rolls forward in a satisfying manner. We do not need more forced 'Peter hiding his identity'-based tension, and I'm thrilled how it's handled in this movie. That's how I felt, I felt I wasn't forced to care about things I don't really care, especially in a reboot. The action looks wonderful and I do like the suit - and of course I like the fact that Spider-Man's web doesn't come from his body anymore.As I said, some corners are cut short and of course there are some stupidities. For me, these are all forgivable. Webb's crew is serious about this character and the movie. There is a lot of love put into this film. It shows, it really does. I'm saying this even if I thought the main villain wasn't handled the way I liked. The overall quality is that strong. Some genuine moments, like when Sally Field delivers an explosion of emotion without a single spoken word in the end, have such an impact that it's easy to forgive plenty.Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is still the best one, but I enjoyed this almost to the same extent. It can be dumb and sometimes doesn't respect the intelligence of its audience, but it's simply an enjoyable ride nevertheless. Too bad the sequel was horrible. Let's just pretend that it didn't happen.",8,32,50,5 August 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This shouldn't work, but it does.
","Before I begin, I'll say this: It's recommended that you're familiar with other X-men movies (I'd say X2, the disappointing X3, First Class and The Wolverine or at least its mid-credits stinger) to fully appreciate this one. It's not necessary in order to understand the movie, but it certainly helps.'Days of future past' is packed with story and characters. It moves quickly from one scenario to another without giving us much breathing time. You don't get to 'dwell' in certain situations/revelations enough and about 15 more minutes to its runtime would've been welcome. Some things weren't explained that I hoped, and some elements seemed too much like cheapish plot devices in contrast to everything else that worked so well.Those were my only gripes, and almost all of them don't matter that much in the end, because the movie convinced me that 'It's OK, we got this'. This movie took my hand and steadily led me through the story. Even when something didn't please me or disappointed me a little, something else quickly came along and hid the annoyances under a rug, allowing me to stay in the movie. The time travel aspect is easy to grasp. You won't (and shouldn't) think about it too much to pick it apart. It works in its simplicity, and while it is a major piece of the story plot-wise, the main focus is on the 1970's characters and the drama. Don't get me wrong, this IS an action film, but the characters are a little deeper than what we usually get from movies of this genre.All the main actors do a great job. Jackman is in his best form, McAvoy steals the central character arc, Fassbender is always enjoyable and Stewart/McKellen of course are full of charisma. Jennifer Lawrence (whose role is pivotal) didn't impress me in First Class, but now I'm a little more convinced. Nicholas Hoult is a likable presence. Trask's character is one we don't get to study deeply, but Dinklage is solid as usual. Some characters don't get much screen time (Ellen Page and BingBing Fan were really good, both for different reasons) and that's surely a problem for many, but in terms of the story every character worked. The surprise here is Evan Peters, in a positive sense.For a fast-paced movie with much to show and tell, the pacing was as good as it could've been. Action, humor, wit, dialogue, some character arcs and drama were handled very well, and in a manner we don't usually see. The narrative is present at all times, even during most action sequences. The structure of this film feels refreshing. It's not something you've seen a hundred times before, and it's almost as if they went with their own pattern instead of following some other established formulas.Normally shoving things that are meant to evoke every emotional response possible into one movie just doesn't work and makes it hard to define a tone. 'Days of future past' handles it with ease. When things are serious, you're convinced. Whenever there's a conflict or a fight, you're excited. When it's funny, it's naturally funny instead of forcing a joke on you. Every little tonal shift feels natural. This film shouldn't work, but it works amazingly well. It reminded me of 'Silver linings playbook' which also was a film that is quite messy as a concept, but the execution made it into something rare and memorable. Directing is great and Singer's touches are there to be seen. Even with some epic action stuff, Singer keeps things 'contained' in an intimate manner that's inventive, intense and works in favor of the movie. No blowing up half the city for no reason here, no unnecessary assaults on your senses. There's enough of intense conversational drama to make you care about said action, not to mention the characters themselves. This movie feels like X2+First Class combined and on steroids. Technically 'Days of future past' is pure quality. Cinematography is beautiful, as are all the special effects. The art and craft of cinema is well represented in many ways. Ottman's music is as good as it's ever been. Absolutely fantastic.With a little longer runtime and a little more focus, 'X-men: days of future past' would've been a 10/10 for me. That said, this movie doesn't feel broke, sloppy or unfinished. It's surprisingly solid for a movie this packed, and in the end I was thoroughly rewarded. How many times after seeing a movie you felt like you were cheated, that you didn't get a fitting ending? This one manages to reward you and tease you at the same time.I loved this movie and was genuinely impressed and moved. DOFP rises alongside X2 as the most satisfactory X-men movie for me. While X2 is a little tighter purely as a construct, DOFP just might be the most enjoyable one. As a story with plenty of emotional weight, nice touches, love for its own characters and plenty of fan service, DOFP is a really wonderful achievement. So thank you, Bryan Singer. You finally got your 'X3'. Also thank you, Simon Kinberg. You proved something with this movie. Hopefully you keep it up, don't let this be just a happy accident.",9,1,2,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Quite solid, if you don't think about the details too much.
","I'm quite surprised how much I liked this one. After the disappointing, hollow performance that was the last Avengers movie, I thought they wouldn't get back on track again. I was feeling a bit cynical when I started watching Captain America: Civil War, but it won me over. Just finished watching the blu-ray.This film could be called Avengers 3. It looks a lot like The Winter Soldier, captivating much of same the tone superficially, but it's more action-oriented and almost everyone is in it. If The Winter Soldier was almost a spy movie, this one is less smart and less intact, but arguably more fun. Being an ensemble flick works in favor of the movie. There's always an interesting character/actor/moment to distract from some of the worse moments, be it unnecessary action, some clichés or some unimaginative short cuts taken by the writers/directors.I'll get some gripes out first, and then I'll get to the things I liked. Studios, please, stop reminding us of the real world and its politics too much. We want to get as far away from them as possible when we are watching a superhero movie. These plots regarding UN meetings and regulations are starting to go a bit too far. I also don't want to see superheroes watching MSNBC any more than Fox News. Why did you insist having real-world corporate news in your movie, when you make up names for whole countries? This kind of stuff always takes me out of these films, and it leaves a taste of vomit in my mouth. Most major news corporations always come with political affiliations, and you know it. Characters reacting to TV news is bad writing in itself already.The big fight in the middle of the film seemed quite forced. I know, the movie was having fun with the concept (and succeeded) but it stood out like a sore thumb from the rest of the film. In fact, without it the movie would have been better, if a bit less fun. It did show us the new Spider-Man and plenty of otherwise nice action, but it was just so out of place. I can imagine the executive meetings and people saying 'but we have to have it in there!' There are also some poorly handled romantic elements involving Captain America. Out of the blue, without any natural progression or real moments. Straight up bad. Some of the dialogue in general isn't that great either, but there's nothing too embarrassing and for the most part it works.Also, if I buy a blu-ray, I don't want to watch car commercials as 'previews'. Come on.Those were my gripes. Now, onto the good stuff. Most of the actors are fine. Not sure about Mackie in these movies though, but I can let it slide. Robert Downey Jr. steals the show and outperforms everyone else easily. He alone made this movie worth watching. He's actually quite intense. Scarlett Johansson was nice to see again, Tom Holland was interesting and Paul Bettany was better than the last time, probably because he was in a better movie now. Chadwick Boseman left me interested, would like to see him more. Evans is alright, but he's the least charismatic actor in these movies. Not a fan.The action is handled well enough, even if some of it seems out of place. It's got that certain 'punch' to it. Unfortunately the shaky-cam makes a return along with too many quick cuts, but mostly it's used to enhance the shot, not to make the shot. When the opposite happens (a few times), it's horrible. The best thing about the action (not counting the dumb, fun battle scene in the middle of the movie) is how confined and tight it is. There are intense fights in cramped corridors, apartments and small spaces. No exploding planets - which is greatly appreciated. Cinematography is decent, and while I don't like the sharp, 'realistic' colors and presentation of this movie, it's just my preference, not a fault. I like to admire some movie magic-like cinematography, and there isn't much of that here.It's a well-paced movie. Not wholly intact tonally or story-wise, but it almost fools you into thinking that it is. It's also well-written in a certain way. There is a short segment that kind of sets up Tony Stark's motivations and the introduction of Spider-Man at the same time. Simple multi-layered setup and payoff that works. Everything is also written in a way that keeps you interested. Even if something stupid is happening, there is always something else interesting to concentrate on. Come to think of it, it's a far dumber movie than what it feels like. This is a compliment for the steady direction of the Russo brothers.And finally: I felt something. I was watching a dumb action movie where people in ridiculous costumes punch each other, and it managed to make me care a little. This was mostly because of Robert Downey Junior, and some of the intense action actually supporting the story and carrying some emotional weight. I usually feel this stuff in the X-men movies, but it was good to see the same thing here too, especially after Avengers: Age of Ultron.In short: a solid movie. Plenty of weak and/or questionable stuff to pick apart, but it's very entertaining and generally well-made. It wants you to think it's a serious story, but I'd advice approaching it as what it really is - a superhero action movie. As such, it does its job well. It was a good year for these kind of movies for me: I really liked Deadpool, I also liked the campy and inconsistent X-men Apocalypse, and I liked this one. Suicide Squad doesn't count, that was the most cynical 2-hour music video I've ever watched. But yeah, all in all a good year for these flicks. This one is recommended.",7,1,3,5 October 2016
Die Hard 2," Worst of the four.
","I got the DVD-box which contains all four Die Hard-movies. I watched them all again, leaving this one for the last. There aren't many successful franchises around with 3rd and 4th movie being better than the second. Die Hard has made the exception.I was entertained by the three other movies, being able to forgive some silliness and just enjoy the action and the characters. Die Hard 2 just made me uncomfortable several times.The whole idea is good enough, and the settings aren't that bad. Some plot twists are decent. Some action scenes don't suck. That's it.Main character McClane is handled poorly. He's too serious when he should crack some jokes, and tries to be funny at wrong times. It feels cheap after the first movie. At least the third one, 'Die Hard with a Vengeance', took McClane back on track with a sense of self-irony. Dennis Franz probably hated his role, being a cliché-filled anti-McClane officer.The plot holes and other stupid scenes don't help much. I'm not expecting a reality-fest from a Die Hard-movie, but come on. I didn't know crap about radio communication or grenades when I was twelve when I first saw this movie, but even then I managed to hang my head against a wall in shame for my fellow countryman Renny Harlin.But who cares when you got action, right? Umm, yeah. You get explosions, frequent slo-mo deaths, bad fist-fights, dull chase scenes and McClane shooting as bad as the bad guys, just to break some lamps and decorate the walls. I didn't get the 'evil grin' on my face, not once. In the first movie, that grin was on my face all the time.But, when you got a character like McClane, you can't totally screw it up. I watched this one from the beginning to the end without getting drunk and R-rated violence is always better than PG13-pudding. I would still like to pretend that this sequel never existed (like the following sequels do), but I can't. It is part of the beloved Die Hard-franchise, and that alone makes this film better than it deserves to be. And I'm glad that I watched this movie again, now I'm sure that I won't have to do it again. edit: Die Hard 5 doesn't count. That's not a Die Hard-movie.",5,13,22,9 December 2007
It Follows," Once you get over the horrible premise, it's quite good.
","Small non-gore, non-Hollywood horror films are something I like to take a chance with every now and then, since Hollywood can only spout out crap when it comes to this genre; jumpscares and uninventive PG-13 formula movies galore - all of things that I despise with a passion. So I bought the blu-ray after having heard good things about 'It Follows'.'It Follows' is definitely not a masterpiece like so many claim. Let's not call everything 'a masterpiece' just because it isn't crap like so many other seemingly similar movies. It offers something fresh and real, but still fails to differentiate itself enough from the clichÃ©-ridden horror tropes that bore and anger me to tears. It's easily better than average Hollywood mainstream horror though, that much is certain.So let's get into it. The plot, or premise, for this movie is horrible. I do like the simple idea of being followed, but I can't take the reason for it seriously. 'The Ring' came to mind. Not because of similarity in story elements (well, perhaps some) but because both movies give you something very stupid and ask you to believe it in order to enjoy the rest of the movie. I won't spoil it, but I had a hard time with it. Eventually, just like with 'The Ring', I managed. Luckily this time even the movie itself didn't want to dwell on the reasons or origins of the phenomena it presented us, and instead just went with it. Props for that.After we have been informed about the laughable main plot, and once we have gotten over it, 'It Follows' shows its claws. Things happen in somewhat believable manner (if you excuse the 'no parents' or 'where did they change their clothes' kind of stuff and a few other stupidities for the sake of a tighter story) or at least the actors/director make it seem like it. When something seems off, another thing comes along to pull us back to the movie. If you're not easily immersed, this might not be the movie for you. It's a simple movie that doesn't hold up in scrutiny. It's all about being in the present and trying to keep you in the moment - and this is handled well.We get no one-liners, no awful expository dialogue just for the sake of it, no senseless side events to distract us from what's happening, no teen slang attempts to make you rage. Because of how tight and straight everything was handled, I actually got scared every now and then. Some nice tricks are used well and creatively, and the pressing atmosphere is there almost all the time. That atmosphere and several well-handled creepy bits are indeed something that I've been waiting and missing from horror movies lately....But just when you think you're watching a real gem, you count your third jumpscare or witness some of the messy writing, especially during the bigger ending scene. It's almost a shame that a movie like this uses jumpscares, when there is plenty of atmosphere already. It's not all over the place and this movie certainly isn't built around them, but the fact they used them - often for no purpose and without earning them beforehand - grinds my gears. The main story has a final act that seems forced, especially the last 'action' scene. It seems to be there just because so many other movies and stories did it. At this point, we realize we are watching a movie that couldn't ride all the way with its fresh approach. Perhaps the approach and the gimmicks came first, and the script came last.'It follows' is pretty well shot. Shots are framed and lit nicely, and while sometimes the quality of equipment (or the quality of blu-ray, not sure) shows, the movie looks good in general. I might have noticed some CGI in couple of shots, but those were probably the only shots with CGI in the whole film. This is a good thing, and I must say that many practical 'tricks' were handled with style.The music was hit or miss, most of the time miss. There were a few bits when it managed to complement the scene or the movie itself, other times it made my ears bleed. I want to be immersed, not annoyed. I like the idea of using synths in general though, and at least they tried something different. Many have mentioned getting a John Carpenter-vibe out of it, even if I didn't.Actors did a fine job. Maika Monroe, Geir Gilchrist and Jake Weary were good. There were other characters with no real purpose, I guess the actors were alright for those parts too, but the characters themselves stood out as glorified extras. Not that you can't have them, but you could see where a few 'let's have something happen to that one, or let's give that one something to do' thoughts got the best of writer/director David Robert Mitchell. The results were clunky, annoying or pretentious (one side character gets to read a 'deep' quote from a book). Anyway, the actors were fine. Thumbs up for some of the 'creatures' and the actors portraying them too. At their best, they were excellent. They had small roles but very important ones.I will now compare this movie to many Stephen King books; Good, atmospheric and gripping piece of entertainment that falls flat at some points along the way, not knowing or daring what it wanted to do. I do recommend it though. I bickered a lot about this movie, but only because it could have been so much better. The potential was there.'It Follows' is better than most horror movies nowadays, and I don't regret purchasing the blu-ray. Just don't expect a masterpiece and you might be rewarded.

Django Unchained," 'D'artagnan, motherf....'
","I'm going to try to make this a short review. I watched this on blu-ray, and while I did enjoy the film, at least my blu-ray version was very short on special features, not even a commentary track. Anyway, here goes: From the very first note of the 'Django' theme and the very first scene, I knew this was going to be a really fun ride. And so it was.The film is paced very differently from what we usually get nowadays. The first hour or so seems almost like a montage, in which Django along with Dr. King are set up to point X. From point X, the movie slows down a lot. Everything happens very slowly like in a conversational drama, we see every moment in detail and the movie just takes its time. The last 30 minutes just explodes in your face with action, silliness and buckets of blood. Normally this wouldn't work well and here lies the biggest weakness of 'Django unchained': the film can feel a little out of focus with these tonal and pacing shifts at times. When it grips you one moment, it can let you loose at another. It doesn't feel as tight and solid as you'd expect and it can be a dealbreaker for some people. That said and recognized, I rate this movie purely on how much I enjoyed it, and luckily I did enjoy it a lot despite the aforementioned issues.Even if I could describe and dissect this movie perfectly (which I can't), it's ultimately just damn entertaining to watch. You get it all: drama, humor, costumes, great soundtrack, nice scenery, awesome characters and performances, good dialogue and two kinds of action: one that is brutal and almost shocking to watch, and other that is just over the top and funny as hell.The performances are great. And I even think that Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for this movie too, shouldn't have got the award. I'm not saying he's not good, he certainly is good and his character ties many things together. What I'm saying is there were so many great performances that Waltz was just one of the highlights and possibly not even the best one.Samuel L. Jackson was amazing and he would've been my pick for the award. I knew he is a good actor, but I was a little bit surprised. Leonardo DiCaprio was a blast to watch. At first it seemed like it's 'just Leo having fun', but after awhile he really became something else than 'just Leo giving a performance'. It was powerful and I enjoyed the hell out of his work. It became hard to root against the guy, no matter how evil of a bastard he was! Jamie Foxx in my mind was at his best in the first act, and after that 'just fine', which is definitely enough but character-wise I was expecting a little more. Don Johnson was fun. This is definitely a movie in which even the guys with not a lot of screen time (Walton Goggins, Michael Parks, the great Bruce Dern) have an impact on you. Kerry Washington had the least impact on me. I don't think she was bad, I just didn't think she stood out enough, which is perfectly understandable with all the wonderful performances around her. Tarantino himself was also pretty useless, but hey, I can take a cameo.The soundtrack is great. Pure western (the great Ennio Morricone) along with some...rap? I don't know how it works. It shouldn't, but every piece of music I heard made me nod in acceptance or mosh violently with the beat.Costumes, sets and scenery are all very beautiful to watch. Thumbs up to production department.This is a long movie. One time I even thought it ended, and there was still almost 30 minutes to go. Nevertheless, we get a rewarding ending and I really couldn't see any of the longer scenes being cut. They are all either important or just too fun to be cut. 'Django unchained' justifies its length.This movie has so much in it. It is absolutely more emotional and fun than it's intelligent, so watch this movie for what it is and in the right state of mind. One of my favorite westerns, only topped by a couple of Clint Eastwood films and possibly Mangold's '3:10 to Yuma'. Recommended for everyone, except of course children and hipsters.",8,0,2,10 December 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," My second take on X3.
","I saw it at a theater when it was released. I remember making up excuses for it, anything to make it more appealing. After all, X2 was my favorite superhero film (and still is) at the time and I really wanted X3 to be great for me. I did review it earlier, but only now can I see the whole picture after all these years (and repeat viewings. yes, I own the film).It never bothered me that characters don't appear or act exactly like in the comics. The most important thing was the 'feel'. You know, like 'go cyclops!', anything that made me root for those guys and make them seem as they were real. That said, I enjoyed both X-men and X2. After X2, I was so hooked I was waiting for this one so much that I think I haven't waited for any other movie.It was...It was alright. I did notice all the things people are complaining about. A lot of wasted potential, some bad dialogue (yet some good too), the film was too short and felt a bit rushed, a few irritating scenes...but it was OK as a popcorn flick. For me, that's bad. I don't want my X-men movies to be rushed popcorn flicks that render themselves useless, cheap and even damaging to the franchise itself over time.The movie tries to be emotional, and at times succeeds. Yes, I felt something for Cyclops and Professor X. On the other hand, Cyclops was treated like a nobody in this movie and his fate didn't actually have any impact on anything. Same with Professor X. And when you try to force the emotional impact with Wolverine crying, I might have a problem. Certainly a fanboy problem only, but still a problem. Many characters and things are just put there (Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Callisto) without establishing anything that well, forced and crammed, treated cheaply, and this is what you get. An OK popcorn flick.I wanted to see how Phoenix would be handled. It was my favorite storyline when I grew up with the comics. It was very disappointing. I don't have a problem with the 'origins' of Phoenix in this story. It's just like many things: she's just put there, waiting for her big scene and that's it. Janssen isn't a bad actor and certainly portrays a confused all-powerful woman well, but oh my, such a waste. A huge waste.How about the action? Eye candy, mostly well done. FX are very good, and although the action scenes lack certain character (for example: compare Wolverine's bland claw fighting to anything in X2) they are well made. The humor is there and one-liners too, although sometimes the movie is tacky and tries too hard. There are ways to dispense some comic relief in an otherwise dark-mooded film, but again - it isn't as funny when it really tries to be nor as dark as it pretends to be.The movie is too short, things are rushed (though the pacing manages to work adequately) and it has an effect on many things. The characters aren't allowed to react or breathe, same with the story. It just rolls along and stuff happens, and you feel the waste of potential drama and certain depth. Even if the stuff that happens isn't boring - I'll give it that - that's pretty much all this movie really succeeds at. It's not boring. That's it. All the other aspects and possibilities are a bit wasted.It may sound like I really hate this movie. I don't. As I said, It's OK. Which is very disappointing for me. Time for me to list some good stuff. McKellen and Stewart are joy to watch as always. I liked Angel's very small role and the certain symbolism in it. I liked that the movie tried to be dramatic. I certainly loved 'Frasier' (as this stupid form won't let me spell his last name correctly for whatever reason) as Beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. There are good things in this movie, even though most of them are casting choices and just some particular scenes. So I give it a 6. My nerdrage would demand a 3 or 4, but I'm trying to be sensible. Sadly, X3 is the movie that had the most at stake, basically finishing a trilogy. It is the movie that wasted the potential of Phoenix and killed off beloved characters. I'm certainly not saying that killing characters is bad and shouldn't happen, but in a disappointing movie like this, much of the impact is wasted. Even now, when 'Days of future Past' is around the corner, Bryan Singer is 'fixing' some things X3 gave us with the help of a story that includes time travel. X3 suffers from its disappointing aftermath just as much as it suffers from its flaws. It's seen as something that has to be fixed, forgotten or ignored. This is of course a problem for the fans and those creating sequels/prequels and not a problem in the movie itself, but you get the point.Singer, thanks for the first films and for building up this one, love the great work. Ratner, you didn't totally suck, but don't ever do this again, no matter what the franchise. Stop it. Don't do it.",6,0,0,30 May 2006
The Bourne Legacy," Actors, especially Renner, make this decent enough to see once.
","Just watched it. What to say? It's a bit of a mess. Perhaps I'm just dumber than your average person, but the script was more complicated than the plot itself was. The storytelling, editing, everything should've been simplified. The movie would've been more effective that way. I always liked the first Bourne movie of the previous trilogy the most. It didn't try to be smarter than it was, it already had a solid foundation. Pacing was great and the lack of shaky-cam was a blessing. This one feels like the last two films of said trilogy.Here, we have Jeremy Renner giving a great performance in a mediocre movie. Every time he's on the screen he steals it scene by scene. Rachel Weisz is decent, and one of my favorites Edward Norton is seriously underused and eventually wasted in this movie. Nobody gives a bad performance. Actors make this one worth your while.The basic plot isn't bad. It's good enough. Gilroy took a lot out of it with his pacing, which doesn't work for me. I didn't get too invested emotionally - which was exactly the case in the last two Bourne movies too. This story is not as complicated as it's made out to be, so why choose this approach? Gilroy just repeated the pacing and storytelling methods of the last two Bournes (which he also wrote but didn't direct). Using the same style makes sense since the happenings of those movies occur in 'real time' parallel to this story all the time. I appreciate the effort, but it just doesn't work. If anything, this story should've been presented in a more simple and personal manner. Gilroy not only copied the style from the previous Bourne movies, but REPEATED almost all of the 3rd act from those last two Bourne films. That was unnecessary, tedious and didn't work well. You get running on the roofs, eye-raping chase scenes with a thousand quick cuts that hurt your brain while you try to comprehend the big picture visually, a token counter-assassin, shaking cameras and narrow urban streets. The 3rd act was where I gave up on this movie. They did not have to repeat the two previous Bourne movies, especially like this. Tiring, useless and very disappointing. Especially when this had all the potential to be a very solid movie. The basic plot was there, characters were there, excellent actors were there.That said, there are some good scenes in this movie. Especially one taking place in Weisz's character's workplace and another in her house. Every scene that makes Renner's characters deeper is also good and exciting. Some fights are not that bad for a PG13-film. I hate shaky-cam action more often than not, but not counting the 3rd act, it didn't bother me that much. Definitely not as much as in 'Bourne supremacy' which is a very, very hard film to watch. I have a huge problem with Paul Greengrass' directing and camera work in that one. About that PG13..these are not kids' movies. These need to be R-rated, seriously, even though it wouldn't have made this film a masterpiece.I hate it when I see a movie that's decent, but could've been so much better. Like with 'Looper', this movie had all the elements to be a really exciting film, but someone (Gilroy) lost the ball. Renner's character should've been the abslolute centerpiece of this movie, now he's just...another piece. A big piece, but still just a piece. He carried this movie, and more emotional investment to him would've been a good idea.But hey, if you haven't watched it, and you like Jeremy Renner, at least he will not disappoint you even if the movie does.",6,1,3,3 September 2013
X-Men: Apocalypse," Neat collage of the whole series, despite structural flaws.
","I quite liked it. It's not a very good movie in itself, but there's definitely a certain quality to it. I'll go through the things I liked, the things I didn't and try to end this with a summary. No spoilers here.'X-men: Apocalypse' could easily be called 'X-men: Everything'. It crams so much in one movie that it's almost like a collage or celebration of the whole series. All the themes/elements we are familiar with are there. When you add gritty violence for a PG13-movie, plenty of '80s nostalgia plus nods and tie-ins (some of them quite smart) to the other movies, we have a lot to soak in. Plenty of fan-service to be had, including the very last shots of the movie. This installment resembles a comic book or the cartoon series more than any other X-men movie before. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience too, despite the graphic violence. Strong individual moments keep the ship afloat, and it's quite entertaining overall.The sheer amount of material demands a slow build, and it takes quite a while for 'X-men: Apocalypse' to hit its groove. For me, it kept getting better and better towards the end. The last 40 minutes are devoted to action, but unlike what I heard, it isn't just idiotic carnage (even though it almost crosses the line). The battles have some narrative and emotional elements to them. This is what I always loved about Singer's X-men movies: the action is part of the story, never full-blown noise and fury without any purpose or weight. It's all charmingly confined, and the scale is only huge on the surface. Politics and military are left out, which is a plus.The main newcomers to the cast were good! Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee were immediately likable and convincing. Considering that they play some of the most beloved characters in the universe, the happier I am for them. If these three continue making these movies, I'll continue to see them. Oscar Isaac was good too, although the heavy prosthetics and some clumsy writing weren't helping. He had to be better than what he was given. Fassbender, McAvoy and Peters are solid professionals, even though the writing for their characters fluctuated throughout the movie as well. All three, especially Peters and Fassbender, got to steal some scenes. Nicholas Hoult is his likable self. I'm still not sold on Jennifer Lawrence, but thankfully the movie isn't centered around her as much as I feared. Overall the cast was more than fine. I've always liked Tom Sigel's cinematography, and this one is no exception. The colors, the lighting, shot composition and camera-work overall are handled well. I liked many of the sets, and generally the film pleased my eye, looking like a movie should. John Ottman composed his best score yet. The familiar theme music is there, but I recognized an entirely new theme too, and it worked beautifully in its simplicity. The craft of cinema is well represented, although (just a) few of the visual effects seemed rushed.On to the criticisms. The pacing feels clunky and the narrative disjointed. 'X-men: Apocalypse' struggles to find its tone and focus. It doesn't have a tight core to it. The quality within a scene can be inconsistent. It does what it's supposed to do and gets significantly better towards the end, but some of the impact is lost. There are so many transitions that sometimes otherwise good and emotional moments do not pay off in the grand scheme of things. In short: It seems like a collection of scenes. The movie isn't nonsensical, it just doesn't always know how to present itself best. I get the feeling that this one was a bit rushed, or that the writers and director Singer didn't bring their A-game like they often did before. The writing. There are luckily some really smart moments in this film, but when the writing is bad, it's noticeably bad. The dialogue as well as the narrative scene composition can and will feel tacky, blunt or forced at times. These moments feel like they used the first draft of a script accompanied with the first take of a scene. Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse is good at best, but sometimes he's reduced to a bunch of clichés. While I like the endless conflict between Xavier and Magneto, they had forced moments too. The movie didn't always earn them, and I was reminded of the embarrassing JFK scene from 'Days of Future Past' a few times. Familiarity. If you are hoping for X-men to tackle all new themes and plotpoints, prepare to be disappointed. It's all very familiar. I didn't mind it, and I'm impressed how they still managed to make these old themes and tie-ins feel worthwhile at all, but be warned.Characters. Some characters are just henchmen or appearances without depth. It's hard to avoid in an ensemble movie like this, and it's not a problem in an already long movie, but fans of many characters will be left wanting. To summarize: 'X-men: Apocalypse' is a compilation of all familiar X-men themes in one movie that somehow manages to stay intact, despite almost tearing apart in many ways. It's not tight narrative- or pacing-wise, it's very inconsistent and it's got some dumb bluntness to it. It's still an ambitious effort and a quality ensemble piece. Some individual, powerful moments, elements and performances carry the movie when needed. Not nearly as good as 'X2' or 'Days of Future Past', but nowhere near a failure. I was entertained. Recommended for fans of the series and especially the cartoon. Very re-watchable, will buy on blu-ray. I hope Bryan Singer will return to this franchise. If not, at least he tied all the movies together, one last time. Fox, you know what you set up with this one. Don't screw it up.",6,1,6,23 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Genuinely Enjoyable Movie
","This isn't about brands for me. I don't care about Marvel universe that much, and I don't read comics anymore. I loathe studio wars, and 'expanding cinematic universe' is a phrase that nowadays makes me almost puke. I don't care about that stuff. But I do care about good movies, and after just seeing Guardians of the Galaxy for the fourth time, I wanted to share my thoughts on this film, because there might still be a few people on the fence.First off: you don't have to read any comics to get this movie. You don't have to watch 400 other movies in order to enjoy it. You can jump right in, just like I did. Guardians of the Galaxy is the closest thing to Star Wars (the originals and Force Awakens) without actually being Star Wars. Space is merely a setting, as the core of this story lies in the characters, surprisingly fresh sense of humor and good old-fashioned adventure. All of the characters are great fun. Not just average movie-fun, but genuinely fun. It's amazing how enjoyable the core group is to watch. It does remind you of the old adventure movies which knew exactly how seriously they should take themselves. How seriously does this film take itself? There is a talking raccoon. There is a walking tree. It's crazy, but just the right kind of crazy. It's not like the movie is cynically trying to get your attention with 'look at me! aren't I random?' crap, because it actually seems like the people involved really cared about what they were doing. This was proved true when I got a little choked up in the end, when Dave Bautista was petting the head of a CGI raccoon (voiced well by Bradley Cooper). When you see it, you know what I'm talking about. It's a really hard balance and tone to strike here. We have these crazy characters that make you smile and laugh - and the few more dramatic moments manage to strike you hard. The best thing about all this is that they're not hammering these emotions to your head. It feels natural. It feels natural in this world which is just a weird fantasy land with no real weight to it. That's an accomplishment.All the actors are clearly having fun. Chris Pratt is good, Zoe Saldana as well, and Michael Rooker is a real treat. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lend their voices to some of the best CGI characters to date, and it works. The story itself is just...just a reason to make our heroes go from point A to B. It's not great. I didn't care about it, and thankfully I didn't even have to. There's a McGuffin, a bad guy and your usual formulaic crap. The story itself is the weakest point of this movie, and I must say that the ending was rather bad. Luckily, the focus is very closely on our heroes almost the whole time, and you can easily forgive the poor story. Even some little bits that were obviously setting up other movies didn't bother me, because director James Gunn managed to blend it all in nicely.Talking about James Gunn, he was the right man for this job. I'm tempted to check out other movies he has done, because Guardians of the Galaxy feels almost like a B-movie in just the right way. There are plenty of scenes and gags which are so stupid that they become good. He even manages to make some of the clichés fun, letting the audience know that he knows how they feel. It's like the director is playing with you, but not on the opposing team. He is clearly having fun, and the soundtrack is just another proof of it. Plenty of oldies, David Bowie's Moonage Daydream being my favorite. Oh, and the blu-ray has Gunn's commentary track on it, and it's a pretty good one.To summarize: It's a fun movie with a childish heart that manages to wake up that kid inside you. And if you are indeed a kid, the happier you'll be when you see this weird flick. It's not tangled by the strings of Marvel's 'cinematic universe' at all, it manages to be its own movie. Some movies just please people and manage to make them happy, and this is one of them. Not a cinematic masterpiece, and somewhat formulaic under the surface, but certainly a genuine crowd-pleaser with some of that movie magic that's hard to come by anymore.",8,1,5,20 January 2016
Prisoners," I love this movie.
","Just watched it on blu-ray, had it lying around for some time. There is a reason I didn't see it right away - I was worried. I was aware of the many disappointments these kinds of films have often given me in various ways. I was also worried that it might be one of those kidnap-related thrillers that gives away too much and makes the horrible mistake of putting the viewer (me) ahead of the main characters in terms of plot.Thankfully, this was not the case. 'Prisoners' evades so many clichés and tropes that it's worthy of some serious applause. It teases you, but mostly lets you off the hook soon after. Most of the time you're trying to unravel the mystery with the main characters at their pace, and if you at some point get ahead of them it's actually a transition that serves a purpose.This movie is the best thriller of its sub-genre I have seen in a long, long time.In terms of directing, writing, acting, cinematography and subtle music, thumbs up to the roof. The atmosphere is amazing and everything works so well together. For aspiring cinematographers and character writers this movie should be a must watch.I like Hugh Jackman a lot. He is very good and brings that rough edge to his character. But to my surprise Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely amazing and doubled my appreciation for him. You see, he didn't have a huge range to work with and the character was simple in a sense. It could've easily fallen into something monotone and uninteresting, but he was the most intense character in the film. Add the always excellent Melissa Leo and surprisingly effective Paul Dano, and you got a stellar cast. Not a single bad performance.As much as I like the story, this is as much a character film as a mystery. Our two protagonists are trying their best to handle an impossibly difficult situation. At some point, humanity and instinct will take over at the cost of everything else. I believe we all have that breaking point. If you have children, you will ask yourself some serious questions after watching this movie. I do not have kids, but I still questioned myself.Nothing is handled cheaply. In 'Prisoners', characters aren't idiots. You understand the motivations. You understand the humanity and connect with it. When it comes to the antagonists, it's not (luckily) too clear and serves the story perfectly the way it's handled on their part. The ending is fitting and you don't feel cheated when it's all over. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for not treating us like idiots hungry for filler we've seen a thousand times.There are religious themes present in this film. It's nothing too simplified and I believe this movie isn't making a statement about these things. Doomsday-preppers may get a laugh or a frown about some things, but I found it all interesting.'Prisoners' isn't an easy watch. It's not a shock/gore movie by any means, but it doesn't water itself down either. It treats its material with honesty, without pandering to PG13-audiences. This might be a little modern masterpiece for me. It's possible that I was just positively surprised after my initial worries or that it just seems so good in comparison to the usual crap Hollywood produces, but nevertheless my experience was fantastic.",10,1,2,13 June 2014
Silence," Does the spark die?
","I didn't read the book, nor am I an expert in history, so I will not nitpick about any of that. I will only focus on the story, which the movie does too - thankfully.'Silence' got under my skin. I'm a believer in God, specifically in Jesus Christ, so naturally I was invested because of that alone, but I believe this movie isn't specifically targeted towards me. It's not manipulative nor does it preach to its audience. Quite the opposite, in fact - it put me in a hard place. It puts you in a place where you really have to think about how you deal with your faith and what that faith ultimately is. I also believe anyone can find something about this movie, it doesn't tell you what to believe or what's wrong and right.'Silence' is a movie about two Jesuit priests who embark on a mission to find their former catholic mentor, who has allegedly renowned his faith in Japan where he was a missionary. They find some Japanese people clinging to Christianity, and those persecuting it. Sounds like a simple, manipulative shock movie? It's not. While it is grim and there are some shocking scenes, this movie gets you in a different way. There is a constant, underlying story about nature of faith in an environment where that faith isn't welcome, and it's pushed to its limits.I don't recall seeing a movie where a man struggles to keep his faith that moved me this much. It's not about some pretentious, meaningless problems: it's about harrowing situations, forces and things beyond one's control - and also about the inner struggle between pride, despair and doubt. It's inescapable. This movie is uncompromisingly brutal in what it wants you to ask yourself, and it doesn't let you off easy. I saw myself in many of the characters, and it was always about their weaknesses and shortcomings. I don't want to look at those dark parts of my soul, but sometimes I have to, and this movie pushed me there.Every part of the movie has a purpose and it always seems to have something to say. The journey might be long at times, and uncomfortable at others, but the journey is just as important as the destination. In the end we get a glimpse of something. For some it can be defeat, for some it can be hope. Perhaps it's about what the nature of faith really is, when it's stripped out of everything else but its own essence, and that's something I find myself thinking about as I'm writing this review. I find the the ending beautiful in its own way.Everyone is great in 'Silence'. Garfield, Neeson and Driver are very good, and they all bring in that 'something' they possess. Their performances are without ego. I didn't see famous people acting, I just saw people. But the Japanese cast must be applauded. All of them. Every single one of them, even those with only 10 seconds of screen time, nail their parts. This is not some cynical Hollywood diversity meeting, no, these are real actors doing a real damn good job. I don't want to single anyone out, but Oida, Tsukamoto, Kubozuka, Ogata and Azano were very good. But once again, even the 'villager' and 'wife' actors/actresses were amazing and their parts should not be forgotten.Cinematography is great, if you don't count just a few shots that weren't as good as everything else. It's not just about breathtaking scenery - although you get that as well - but the cinematic language is present in the visuals. Same with the music, it works in favor of the film. You almost never hear it, but when you do it's mostly just harrowing noise. It's still not meaningless noise without effort or meaning, because it finds a way to communicate something that visuals alone will not.Scorsese wanted to get this movie made for a long time. Now he did it. It's easy to see why the man who directed 'The Last Temptation of Christ' would be interested in this story. It's clearly personal to him, but it's personal to me too. It's a sign of a truly powerful movie to feel a little broken after seeing it, only to find out it's slowly putting you back together again the more you think about it.'Silence' is like any passion project of an artist, it's not going to be loved (or even seen) by an enormous amount of people. It's also slow, probably offensive to different people for myriad of reasons, it's about religion and faith. But it's also about hope and that little mysterious and persistent spark inside us. It's not 'them' who can kill the spark, it's always us. And even if we feel like we killed that spark and all is lost, perhaps we can take a lesson from Kichijiro...and try again.",10,14,25,24 June 2017
Logan," Almost great, but falters in the end.
","I like James Mangold as a director. He's made some very fine movies. I even liked 2/3 of the last Wolverine movie he directed. I liked this one too, but I'm sad to say that just like 'The Wolverine', this movie lost me in the end. I was a little disappointed when it was over, which is a shame, because otherwise 'Logan' is just great. Mangold made a movie for adults, so I will judge it as such.'Logan' feels driven. The script seems solid, direction as well, and the actors are doing a great job. Cinematography is excellent. This feels and looks like a real movie, not a calculated studio product. Humor isn't forced, themes are handled with taste, the serious vibe of this movie feels natural. Marco Beltrami's music is beautiful and atmospheric. Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Dafne Keen are all excellent. I can't say enough about these three, they were so good. Hugh gave it his all, Sir Patrick Stewart brought tons of heart into the movie and Dafne Keen, despite being a child actor, was excellent in what she did. Acting-wise, admirable.'Logan' is almost like a road movie. It's very confined, nothing is too much of a spectacle. Even when some really brutal violence kicks in every now and then, it seems to fit. Everything supports the narrative and the tone. It trusts the audience to understand the language of grown-up movies, and there's even real heart to it. It's like the Wolverine movie that I always wanted. For the first 90+ minutes, that is.And then...then something happens. I don't know what. Did the writers just not know how to end the movie, or did they not have time? Did Mangold drop the ball? Because the narrative starts to stutter. Out of nowhere, we get some amateur-level storytelling, bad plot devices and clunky transitions. Themes that were handled so well until now, are now almost hammered to your head. This movie stopped being smart and surprising, and started to be a little more clichéd, obvious and pandering.At the same time we're introduced to a bunch of new characters that I could not care less about. It wasn't an intimate movie anymore. The tone and pacing seemed to suffer, and the last battle became a schlock-fest, along with a few campy shots of Hugh Jackman running like an ape and roaring like it's a B-movie. What was first a great and impressive Wolverine movie, was now a mediocre X-men movie, unsure of itself and desperate to impress. The whole situation is suddenly cartoony, almost turning our main characters into cartoons as well. What happened? It went so well for so long, it was perfect. I was so invested, but suddenly I couldn't feel anything anymore - even when the seemingly emotional (and admittedly good) ending hit the screen. That's when I should have cared the most. That's the worst of this movie's sins: Many things that made this movie great were pushed to the side in the end. It didn't stick to its guns all the way, which is a bit of a shame. It didn't trust itself (or the audience) enough. Did the last 30 minutes ruin this movie? No. The last part of the film isn't inexcusable crap in itself. It makes sense story-wise, and most of my problems with it come from strictly comparing it to the amazing first 90 minutes. It's just so disheartening for me to not be able to love 'Logan' until the very end. I wanted to have that great ending, I wanted to be invested all the way. I didn't and I couldn't, but I'm hoping that after seeing this movie again I can be more at peace with it.That said, this is still a quality movie. 'Logan' is a charmingly simple film. It's focused on characters instead of complicated stories. It's beautifully made, violent, often heartfelt, even naturally funny at times. It's a genuinely good Wolverine movie with elements that we haven't seen before. It's not interested in setting up other movies, and as much as I disliked the change of tone and quality in the end, this one actually has an ending - which is a plus. It is a movie of its own, not a cynical advertisement for other movies.To summarize: 'Logan' is a great, well-crafted movie full of character, structure and intimacy until it decides to be something else just when it's supposed to count. What it does right, it does absolutely right and what it does wrong, feels worse than it is because of the things that it got right. It's well worth seeing and arguably a lot better than the last Wolverine movie, but it could have been a great movie through and through. In the end, it's 'just' a good movie, which is nothing to scoff at. It's not 'the best superhero movie out there', which is what some critics are saying. Not even the best X-men movie - that title still belongs to the amazingly solid X2. 'Logan' came very close, but Mangold and his writers (who all did a really good job otherwise) just couldn't pull off that last mile. Worthy effort in any case, easily succeeding in many things that are quite hard to accomplish. For those of you looking to be more invested in characters and confined little stories rather than ensemble pieces with world-ending threats, 'Logan' will be a very special treat. I will add this one to my blu-ray collection.Thank you, Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart, it was nice having you in these movies. You both went out on a high note. I have a feeling that I'll be seeing plenty of Dafne Keen after this, so no need for goodbyes on her part yet.",6,1,4,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 1000 reviews? Here's one more then!
","There's plenty of pressure when making a highly anticipated sequel to one of the most profitable movies of our time, and there most certainly will be studio executives involved in the creative process - which can sometimes be good, but often bad. I'm not sure what happened here. You can see plenty of 'playing it safe', sticking to the first movie's structure and at the same time trying to be bigger and bolder. You can't do both, and as if that weren't enough, this movie is desperately trying to set up 800 another movies. In the end we got just a serviceable action movie.I had read about too much being cut out of the film, about its messy construct and out of place and/or too frequent humorous quips, and of course about some ridiculous feminist 'controversies' regarding Black Widow and director Whedon himself. I'm glad to say that even if the film was needlessly complicated, it's still understandable enough and it didn't feel like there was supposed to be that much more to it. The humor mostly works and Black Widow - contrary to what screaming hysterical people who can't handle a movie might claim - had the best character moments along with Bruce Banner/Hulk, and they seemed the most human and relatable of the whole cast.The movie itself, if you think about the construct, is very much like the first one. The team gets demoralized, only to team up again and fight thousands of faceless enemies in the end while some sort of McGuffin is around to do something. Short tech-babble and exposition tries to make sense to things in between scenes and acts, just like in the last movie. It feels lazy and forced when you think about it - and it is - but the familiarity wasn't the biggest letdown.The biggest fault in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is that at times it feels more like a product than a movie. Even if I don't count the awkward moments where they're trying to set up other movies, there's still a disconnection between the movie and me. I want to focus on the show, but I feel like the backstage is making too much noise. The story itself is serviceable but never engaging or focused. It's a simple story that is pretending to be something else. Because of that we can see through it and we're noticing many shortcomings we wouldn't care about otherwise. This film doesn't quite overburden itself to a point where everything stops making sense, but the overall tension is lost. Less is more, studio people. Less is more. There is plenty of action. Things are getting punched, things are getting destroyed and energy beams fly all over the place. There are some inventive things and neat choreography. Generally it all looks very good, but I wasn't invested. Like I said, this movie failed to connect with me. I see all these grand things happening, and I can't feel anything. It all felt so emotionally weightless. It's not as bad as in Man of Steel, but it's there. It didn't help the experience when the very first scene in the movie has our heroes fighting faceless enemies we know or care nothing about. It didn't help that the enemy hordes are basically stormtroopers, only to be wiped out easily but unlike stormtroopers, they are completely void of any personality, as they're just faceless things that our heroes need to punch, once again. It didn't help that the main villain has a weird, silly design that makes him absolutely non-threatening (why didn't they go with the original design, which they do use in certain shots in the movie?), and that the events around him are needlessly complicated and forced. It didn't help that the ending of Iron Man 3 means nothing anymore, especially when Marvel is all about this 'big picture' and continuity. It didn't help that two shoe-horned characters with fake Russian-ish accents feel out of place.While the pretty action is lacking in weight and/or heart, there are some cool little character moments here and there. Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo get the best ones and they handle their parts very well. The dialogue in general is easily above average. The (little too numerous) quips mostly work, allowing us to feel something. Robert Downey Junior and Jeremy Renner were enjoyable too, but mostly because they're Robert Downey Junior and Jeremy Renner, not because of the material they had. James Spader's voice did fit the main villain, and I liked that they tried to give him this weird personality, but like I said, the main villain is somewhat wasted with silly design, needlessly complicated plot elements around him and hordes of faceless henchmen. Anyway, these character moments are easily the best parts of the whole movie. Imagine that: In an Avengers movie the fights and story elements make me want to sleep, but the conversations and little subtleties manage to keep me awake.In short: a somewhat decent movie, where the most of the (plentiful and pretty) action and several beats of the story feel like filler. Actors do a pretty good job though, there are smart character moments and unexpected nuances that most movies like this don't have. On a surface level it's entertaining, stuff happens all the time, but it's painfully empty on the inside and nothing like its predecessor. Did Whedon fail to bring his A-game or did the studio force the unbearable stench of cynical corporate mediocrity into this movie? I don't know. Last year was far better for superhero movies, because Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past are leagues above this one. Let's hope that the next big Marvel superhero movie is 'just' a movie, not a product or a brand vehicle to set up other brand vehicles. Because 'just' a movie makes for a better movie than anything else.",5,6,13,11 October 2015
The Dark Knight," Less intact but more powerful than its predecessor
","First of all, pardon my language. I'm finnish, so my writing may seem funny at times. There may be some spoilers, but I try not give the whole movie away (edit: I edited in some thoughts I have now when the whole trilogy is finished).I managed to avoid most of the hype before seeing this film. I just knew that people were very excited about this film and everyone was talking about Heath Ledger and his death. Just before I went to a theater, I found out that 'the Dark Knight' had topped Godfather in ratings. Glad I didn't read any comments about this movie though, so I just turned off my computer and went to see this one with my cousin, knowing little of what to expect.After about 2,5 hours, I was confused. I knew I liked what I saw, and there were many great scenes, 1-on-1 conversations, good performances, great action, and almost anything you'd expect from Nolan's second Batman-flick. But still, I felt like I needed to think about what I just saw, because it didn't just click the way I wanted it to. It was never boring, and the film has so much stuff in it, so it's hard to handle it all if you just see it once. So I thought about it, discussed about it, and it just made me want to see this movie again, which I will do - and probably many, many times. I'm getting there, to the part where it all 'clicks'.Now, I'm not going to compare this one to Spider-Man 3, but I gotta say one thing. Both films have numerous sub-plots, more than one villain, and scenes that could've been just taken away. Spider-man 3 basically sucked because of that, it was too much of a mess. Now, 'The Dark Knight' did much better and succeeded in bringing many little things together, without taking away the dark mood of the film. I was not happy with everything, so let's get it over with (some minor spoilers ahead): What I didn't like: <ul><li>Did the movie really need another villain? I think not. Maybe it could've worked better if the transformation from a good guy to a bad guy hadn't been rushed. I just didn't believe it. I liked how he looked and all, but I didn't believe the total transformation process at all. It seemed it was crammed into a movie that had already too much going on.</li></ul><ul><li>The 'batman' voice. I can somehow deal with it, no problem there, but why must Batman use his alter ego-voice when he's speaking to someone who knows who he is? It takes me out of the movie every time.</li></ul><ul><li>Scarecrow in the beginning, he was just another punk. Why handle a notable villain like that? What was the point? (same thing in TDKR) </li></ul><ul><li>Nolan is not an action director, and it shows at times. Some fights don't have the impact they should, be it from camera work or quick cuts or the overall design.</li></ul>-----------What I liked: <ul><li>The Cast. The performances. Of course I got to say what everyone else has already said a thousand times: Heath Ledger was...he was so great. Every little move he made, every stare, every time he quickly licked his lips, every tone in his voice....greeeat. And I didn't even mention the freaky make-up. I try to see his performance without any death-bonus here, and I think I can safely say that Heath stole the show. Bale was OK and fits well to both roles, he did a decent job, but of course there was no chance for him to throw a million different facial expressions in this role. And because Bale was 'just' OK, it left plenty of room for Caine(especially), Freeman and Oldman to be great as supporting characters for our hero. Gyllenhaal was more believable than Holmes, too. </li></ul><ul><li>The lighting, cameras, sounds, action, effects, whew. Technically, 'The Dark Knight' is top-notch. No question about it. </li></ul><ul><li>The plot, or plots, had many surprising elements to them (funny, how the same thing didn't work for me in TDKR). </li></ul><ul><li>It made you think about morals from many different points of view.</li></ul><ul><li>It has several memorable scenes and powerful lines you can quote for the rest of your life. In many ways, the movie as a whole is worse than the scenes it delivers. 'Batman Begins' is more intact as a film for me, but lacks these powerful scenes.</li></ul>To put it shortly: arguably the best Batman-movie to date. 'Batman Begins' is certainly more whole as a story, but this one has more memorable scenes. TDKR disappointed me, but at least I have these two to choose from. Ledger, rest in peace.",9,5,11,3 August 2008
Elysium," Well worth seeing.
","First things first: This is not the most intelligent Scifi movie some people were expecting it to be. Storytelling is not masterful here, many characters are just plot devices and shallow, there is little subtlety. It is very black and white and at times (you'll know when you see it) requires a little more suspension of disbelief than I originally thought.That said, It's not a dumb movie at its core - it just keeps things simple. There is some obvious exposition, there is a message that's shoved in your face, and Elysium doesn't pretend to be anything else. Give it to me blunt anytime rather than Avatar-like pretentiousness. When you see it, expect a simple story with a simple message. Some actors weren't doing their jobs as well as they could have, but Matt Damon surprised me. I'm not his biggest fan, but I've always liked him. He really surprised me. He carried this movie when it needed to be carried. The movie doesn't have time to develop his character to the fullest, but does it enough. Also, be prepared to watch your inner hipster cry, when child actor Emma Tremblay delivers a scene which you know is just cheap emotional manipulation, but she does it so well that you'll be moved nonetheless. I love when that happens.The action is amazing. As we could tell from District 9, Blomkamp likes to make his action inventive. In Elysium, it's just that. Not only inventive but visually wonderful and often surprising too. Some people have said there's too much non-stop action. I failed to see that, I think there was just enough of it, and never non-stop. Elysium has also some very graphic violence which of course gets my thumbs up.The music is playing with two simple emotions. Melancholy and Aggression. Sometimes the ambient-style howling might be too much, but still does its job. What we have here is a simple story. Simple story, simple characters and simple emotions. Simple does not equal stupid or bad, just simple. People who are into hard SciFi will find plenty of things hard to swallow, and even though I'm not one, I had to suspend my disbelief a little too much at times. Anyway, effective story, very good performance from Damon, great-looking film with inventive action scenes. I'm glad I saw it. I was expecting a bad movie, but instead got a nice little effective film that has a heart.",7,1,4,13 August 2013
Sinister," Not perfect, but very good for a modern horror film
","The Ring (both original and the remake), The Conjuring and Insidious are one of the best modern horror movies for me. Most of them with plenty of flaws and tired clichés, but the good outweighed the bad in such a fashion that I was impressed. It was probably natural that I enjoyed this one too.There are enough jump-scares for people who see horror films for that kind of material, but luckily Sinister doesn't rely solely on them. The atmosphere just gets more and more tense as the movie goes by. There are just enough lighter moments to keep you from getting overly nervous but also not too much to let you lose that sense of horror. The 'real crime author in a house of murder' - type plot is executed surprisingly well, and besides supernatural horror there's a little detective side to the story as well. Most people probably guess what the ending will be like, as I did too. It falls a little flat. Some things are handled a little poorly and the bar is lowered a little. If you're like me and usually give horror movies some slack, you probably won't be bothered too much.There is an element to this movie that is absolutely handled with utmost skill and care. 'Sinister' is built around a certain gimmick. Our main character (played by Ethan Hawke) finds mysterious film reels, which are basically snuff films. We get to see them, and they are disturbing in a way that is rare for horror movies today. It's almost like taking the best out of the whole found-footage genre, and putting bits of it inside a 'real' movie. It doesn't feel like a gimmick, even though it probably is, and it works amazingly well. Not only is it genuinely creepy, but it sets up the mystery plot nicely as well.At times the filmmakers stop relying on the atmosphere and shove a few really idiotic jumpscares or senseless tropes in the film. I like scares, but I also like it when they compliment the story itself and not take you out of it. It's certainly clear that with 'Sinister', less would've been more. Either the script wasn't that great or the filmmakers wanted to please the dumber ones in the general audience or the production company demanded more stupidity in the name of lowest common denominator. We may never know. That is a shame, because for me this could've been a modern classic. There, I got my gripes out of the way. Cinematography, use of sound and lighting all work very well and compliment each other. Technically, very well made. Ethan Hawke delivers, no worries there. I'm really glad they cast him, he just fits. I've always found him enjoyable to watch, even if he doesn't always choose the best movies to work on. His character has that certain edge that doesn't make him bland or too perfect. 8 out of 10 might be too much because there are some things that bother me, but then again I was truly scared and really immersed - the film just worked for me. Watched it on blu-ray at night, and I even had to take breaks because of the tension. Modern horror movies can be really bad but when there are exceptions like this one, I rejoice (and soil myself in the process). If I had to compare this to ie. 'The Conjuring', I'd say that both are very well made, and while 'Sinister' didn't have the tightest script or the balls to rely on its wonderful atmosphere enough, it still scared me more. Both are recommended.",8,1,3,5 August 2013
Sicario," Intense, even when nothing is seemingly happening.
","Just watched it on blu-ray (a really stripped release, at least here in the nordics, no extras at all which is a shame). Trying to gather my thoughts here. 'Sicario' isn't a tight story in the traditional sense. It's not focused on a single central character or point from the beginning to the end, but it's not a mosaic either. It's not like 'Traffic' or 'Crash' where stories of certain characters overlap. It's just a movie that shifts its focus at times without losing the big picture. And I must say that even if I'm not the biggest fan of movies that do this - because I want to focus on one thing only and let the story happen around that one thing - they really made it work.In some ways, this is a disturbing movie. It doesn't run on shock value and the point isn't to burn horrifying images into the viewer's brain, but it's tense. Even when nothing is happening, I feel the tension. And when something happens, I feel the impact. This wouldn't happen if everyone didn't handle their parts well. Director Villeneuve, all the actors, cinematographer Deakins, the sound department - great job. Flawless execution. Writer Taylor Sheridan got on my 'watch this guy's movies if you can' - list as well.'Sicario' doesn't force-feed you anything. It prefers showing rather than telling, and Villeneuve knows how movie language works. Scenes are powerful in a way that few movies nowadays are, and every beat seems to have a purpose. It's a great movie to look at, too. Effective visuals all around.This movie had a few nice surprises to it. So many times when I watch a thriller, I know what's going to happen five minutes before the fact. This isn't the case here, because the audience isn't treated like a bunch of idiots. And even when there are a few familiar moments, they're executed so well that I felt rewarded. Another surprise is how well the action was handled. It had real weight, real impact to it. Every moment mattered. I rarely see this kind of execution that puts many good action movies to shame. And this isn't even an action movie. I'm genuinely impressed.About the actors. They nailed it, and the funny part is that they didn't really get to show their range as actors. They don't have much wiggling room. No Oscar bait performances here. It's almost monotone, but the little nuances are there, and they are powerful. Emily Blunt is at her best, as is Benicio Del Toro (who shows how intimidating he can be). Even Josh Brolin was very good. Blunt and Del Toro had amazing chemistry. There's a scene in the end between these two, and it's amazing in its almost stressing simplicity. We don't get to know much about the characters because the nature of this film - which is a little unfortunate - but we get enough. We get something to latch on to.My only real gripe is this: 'Sicario' is not about a tight or a personally compelling story, it's more about a series of events. Not a mess of events by any means, and it does paint exactly the kind of picture it aims for, but I guess it's just my preference to have it some other way. So while I wasn't personally as invested to the characters I would've wanted to, I do realize what they were going for and I think they succeeded.This is a movie for movie lovers. It can be a little slow at times, so it's not a popcorn flick nor an action movie, but a really well executed film where even the little moments matter. Everyone involved brought their best. Definitely recommended.",9,0,1,8 April 2016
Jack Reacher," Jack Reacher and the art of borrowing cars
","I know nothing about the books, so this review is based on the movie alone.I liked it more than I thought I would. This is not so much an action film as it is a thriller and a detective story. There certainly is action, but it's not the core of this movie. There's a little conspiracy, some character development when needed, and of course the inevitable 'good vs. bad' - confrontation in an expected manner. All of the main elements work quite well. Not exceptionally well, but well enough to keep the film interesting, intact and effective.I felt like I was watching a mixture of Dirty Harry, Bourne and Taken, possibly with a little Lethal Weapon thrown into the mix. And again, I'm not talking about the amount of action, just the overall feeling of resemblance I got. So it didn't feel too original, but three things worked so well that 'Jack Reacher' isn't just a mediocre movie: 1) Christopher McQuarrie knows how to put a story on the screen (as we know from 'Usual suspects'). He knows when to further the storyline, he knows when to give us a little breather. The story is coherent and moves along nicely. Just when you think you need an action scene, you get it. You get some unexpected humor and nice details every once in a while, and everything just seems to have its rightful place. This movie isn't deep and the script is not overly brilliant, but it's handled very effectively and that is something I've grown to like, because the opposite happens way too often in movies. Thumbs up to McQuarrie.2) This movie is wonderfully shot. Cinematography is very good and pleasing to the eye at all times, and on top of that the action is shot very, very well. It wasn't long ago when I watched 'Bourne supremacy' again, and I absolutely hated the unnecessarily shaky camera. 'Jack Reacher' handles action perfectly. You can feel the chaos and the urgency in some scenes, yet you're always aware of what's happening. This is the way I wan't to see action scenes shot, be it a fight scene or a car chase (we get both, and they're very good). I would also like to compliment the satisfying violence. It does what it's supposed to do and looks/feels mean enough in a movie that warrants it. Of course I would've wanted an R-rated cut, but I'm fairly pleased how things were handled.3) Tom Cruise. I can't help it. I absolutely love his work. He's just got that certain presence. When he stares, when he talks, when he throws a punch, delivers some comic relief or pulls off some nice stuntwork - I'm usually sold. He's not especially impressive in this movie, but him just being a professional himself is enough, he carries this film when it needs it. I can nowadays keep my opinions of his 'religion' at bay when I'm watching a movie. I even tried hating him at some point for some juvenile reason, but every time I saw one of his better films (Last Samurai, Oblivion), I was just thoroughly sold and entertained.Acting isn't crap otherwise either. Werner Herzog is always a fun guy to watch, and Jai Courtney is decent (still not seeing Die Hard 5 though). David Oyelowo is interesting, Alexia Fast not too bad at all. Joseph Sikora has only a minor role but delivers a strong performance, especially in the end. Robert Duvall, nice seeing you too! I liked how almost every character was simplistic, in a good way. No overly complicated motivations, just the good old basics. Honorary mention goes to James Martin Kelly who plays a grieving father. Rosamund Pike's character left something to be desired. She is an important piece of the movie, and sometimes I got the feeling that either the director wasn't really sure what to do with her or she just couldn't nail it. Sometimes she's smart, sometimes a little clueless, sometimes emotional and sometimes professional. I didn't get a good grip on her. I enjoyed her though, especially in scenes shared by her and Cruise. Also, it might be that she was the least simplistic character in this film and stood out in a weird way because of that.I really enjoyed watching this movie. It felt like it took a lot of good things (while leaving bad things alone) from 70's, 80's and 90's action thrillers and made them modern again. There's also some fooling around with certain movie clichés in a funny way. Not a masterpiece (with an R-rating, a little more gripping story and a little more developed characters, this could've been a modern classic for me) but certainly a welcome, good old-fashioned thriller with some action and humor on the side. Now, excuse me while I put on my leather jacket, borrow somebody's car and go tell some woman how to do her job.",8,14,20,16 September 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Thank God for Michael Rooker
","I really liked the first Guardians, and while I am getting tired of Marvel/Disney blockbusters, I wanted to give this one a shot because the first one actually felt like a movie instead of a spoke in some corporate wheel. I'm glad I did, because it's quite good. It's basically 'just' a popcorn movie, but it's not without heart. I have gripes, but more about those later. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2' is pretty much the sequel most people probably expected. Likable characters, amusingly weird tone, effective themes and a brisk pace. You get another soundtrack full of good songs and they're used well, which isn't an easy thing to do. Most movies fail trying, because the intent behind it is cynical and based solely on cashing in on a trend. It works here though, and that's a good thing considering how bland the composed soundtracks in Marvel movies are, so at least we get something meaningful to listen to.I don't know if I want to say much about the story. It's not engaging as a sequence of events, and the 'lore' really doesn't matter to me. It's not great in that way. What matters here is the emotional resonance. Yes, we've seen and heard thousands of stories about family, friendship, finding one's place in the world and such. More often than not those stories feel forced, insincere and hollow. Here, they pretty much nail whatever they tried to accomplish. We get some nice, warm and even romantic moments along with sad reminders of loss, loneliness and other things we're all familiar with. When a popcorn movie manages to take you through that ride and end it just right so that you don't feel cheated, it's an accomplishment. The cast is fine, and whenever the movie focuses on the characters it's so much better for it. That's where it shines - although sometimes the performances (or more likely the writing/directing concerning those characters and/or scenes) seem a little disingenuous as if they're just repeating certain antics. But fear not, because Michael Rooker takes over and steals the show. He is blessed with unstoppable charisma and he keeps this movie together. Even when he's spouting bad lines, he's entirely convincing and lovable all the way. Only Zoe Saldana can match him at times, but Michael Rooker is the best actor in Guardians 2, and at the same time his character Yondu is the best thing in the whole movie. Turns out we need him to be just that, because there are times when he has to carry the film.There are two things holding Guardians 2 back. First one is some of the fantastical space action and parts of the plot involving it. At times it's fine and character-driven, and there are inventive little fun things weaved into the mix, but sometimes I felt like I was watching a video game with a very mediocre narrative. I wasn't invested and I was desperate to feel something. Here comes the second problem, which is far worse: the movie understands the first problem, and tries to cover for it with 'funny' lines and wacky moments in order for us to feel something about the characters again. When it works, it's a nice distraction. When it doesn't, it's something straight out of bad sitcoms but just without the laugh track. Yes, I know this movie is supposed to be silly, but when it's trying too hard it loses its charm and it takes me out of the movie. If something is not funny or emotionally meaningful, don't try to force it or it becomes even worse than it was. And if the movie is having a moment, don't destroy that moment with a horribly-timed bad joke or a gag. Some of that stuff really took me out of the experience.In the last act, this movie dives deep into mediocrity, but soon after finds its groove again and rises with astounding confidence. Just when I was about to give up, I was thinking of 'Logan', where the last act totally lost me and I couldn't believe how disappointed I was - I couldn't even enjoy the few good last shots of that movie. Here, it was the opposite. When it was over, I felt rewarded. It hit me emotionally in a way that good directors know how to do. I gave James Gunn some crap about a few questionable character moments (if he's responsible for them that is, who knows with these billion-dollar franchises), but he seems to be a really good director, and I must respect him for writing the movie too. Characters aren't just cheap plot devices for him, most of them have real arcs. He knew when and how to dive deep into them when it was necessary and deliver sincere drama with blunt force. In the end, it was the ride I wanted it to be, even if I had my problems with it along the way. It feels like a movie made by someone who loved what he was doing, which is rare.I guess that's it. Guardians 2 is not as surprising as the first one, but it's not a soulless sequel either. It's not the corporate product I feared it would be. While the story isn't that great and the characters don't always feel as genuine as I'd like, it still packs some emotional punch, a heart if you will. Some jokes and moments didn't work for me at all, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't amused, moved and entertained. Add Michael Rooker's exciting performance, and we have a movie that's easy to recommend for most people. Some grumpy, cynical people like me will have to adjust their expectations, but kids will love this. They'll eat this up like no tomorrow, and for once it's a good thing because Guardians 2 isn't cynical, exploitative or politically preachy as too many movies seem to be.",7,0,1,6 November 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Stupid? yes. Fun? Depends.
","It took an a**load of money to make this movie, probably enough to save a small country from economical disaster and starvation. This is the stupidest movie I've seen in months, but yet I watched it to the end.The story...they didn't need one and they didn't care about one, so it is what it is - poor. I mean 'Masters of the Universe' - poor. If someone expected this to be more mature than the first one, he is in for a disappointment. 'Funny' characters and parts in the movie are very much comparable to Jar Jar Binks. I didn't see any ewoks, but I got a couple of jokes concerning testicles and robot farts. Plenty of needless explosions, Megan Fox-is-so-hot - moments, constant 'we're gonna die' - false drama, it's all there.But the action. It looks great. I know I was watching a stupid movie, but I had some fun with it. More stuff gets blown to bits than my brain could process. Sometimes there is too much action, and you get numb from it. Because of the bad story and cynical approach you don't really care who's fighting who, but that's not all, because from all the shaking, zooming and quick-cutting you can't even tell who's fighting who. Last third of the film is purely non-stop action, and it can get a little boring, but still...those effects are impressive. And I didn't even watch it in a theatre.In the end, this is a stupid, needless, cynically bad but in a certain mindset also a fun movie. Perhaps a guilty pleasure for some. I'd say this would count as garbage entertainment for kids, if not for the shots of Megan Fox's ass, because that's a whole other demographic. That's not exactly material for 7-year old kids interested in Transformers toys. Because in the end, all of this is about toys.",3,0,7,28 August 2010
The Witch," Moody, raw and disturbing.
","I don't quite know what to say about 'The Witch', but I'll certainly try. To sum it up in a stupid way, it's about a family of settlers coming to New England from England. They're extremely religious, to the point where they are driven off from an already religious community. So they live alone in the crude wilderness. Life is hard. They live in poverty, under all kinds of stress and tragic events soon follow. There might or might not be a witch involved. That is all, no spoilers.'The Witch' is a horror movie that is actually a movie. It's not a soulless studio product, it's not about jumpscares or about dumb and uninteresting characters you won't care about. It doesn't dance around hard subjects, and if it wants to show you something, it doesn't shy away. It has that '70s movie feeling to it, so the quality is there. The craft of cinema is continuously on display. It's very well shot, very well paced, filled with exceptional acting and it takes a minimalist approach to almost everything. The locations and clothing feel so real, because they are. You feel like you are in the dirt with these people. Religion is a big part of the movie. I think many people might avoid it for that, religious and non-religious alike, but hear me out. The religion of these people certainly is of a strict kind. Many might find it offensive, as if the movie is making a statement against religion or Christianity in general. Maybe it is, maybe not so much, but I, as a Christian, didn't take offense to it. In fact the movie might have worked on me better because of it. I did recognize parts of myself in some of these characters. Many people back then treated their religion with utmost importance to the point of raw harshness, and I like how this movie shows it. What I like about the religious aspect (which is always present in the film) is that the characters aren't made to be 'evil'. You certainly question them a lot and some of their words or actions do seem outright crazy, but ultimately the movie shows them as real people under unimaginable stress, not so much as villains - which is vital for the movie to work. And the movie works. I was always questioning the main characters, their mental stability, but I was also sensing that perhaps there really is something dangerous and evil out there. It's not a Shyamalan movie that just takes a sudden turn in the end, but there are turns. And when they come, they are deserved, and they do not destroy the earlier parts of the movie leading to those revelations. There is ambiguity to this film though, and I think it's not about the writer/director Robert Eggers being lazy. It certainly doesn't feel like a 'just bring your interpretation to it' - hack job, but instead it leaves you thinking about it. Not out of frustration on your part or pretentiousness from the writer's part, but out of curiosity.The actors are top-notch. Veterans Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson are outstanding which is a given. The two older children are played by Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy. Scrimshaw and Taylor-Joy are excellent, and Taylor-Joy really steals some low-key moments. She has a good career in front of her, it's easy to see. It was these two people that stole the show, and I haven't seen them anywhere before this. I'm glad I did now. However I want to make a special mention about the little kids. You know this isn't a soulless Hollywood movie when the child actors don't make you cringe. In fact, some of the most harrowing scenes in this movie involve pretty good child acting. So well done, Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger. I already complimented Robert Eggers. He did a very good job, and I'm looking forward to his future movies. I must also compliment the DP, because this is a beautifully shot movie. The shots are well framed and lit, and they linger on for quite some time at the right moments. I got some 'Shining' vibes from some of the visual aspects. It's not that great, but there are some similarities. Same with the music - it's not really 'just' music, but noise to make you uncomfortable along with the visuals you're seeing. Just add the hard life of wilderness, and the disturbing mood is set. 'The Witch' is a hard watch. It's not a popcorn movie, but it's not a shock film either. It's just so raw and real, and the tension is always present. The tension eats you a little and gets under your skin. There are some really disturbing scenes, and the minimalist approach works wonderfully with them, because the movie doesn't make a big deal about any of it. It just shows them to you, and they're so much more powerful because of it. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who hates what the horror movie industry has become and yearns for the good old days. I'd recommend it even for those who normally don't like to watch anything to do with religion or occult. It's a slow burner, but it's full of real, raw quality. If you want a fast-paced spookfest or a clear-cut story with every question answered, then this movie might not be for you. For me it's a gem. A gem that I won't be seeing again soon, because I think it got a bit too far under my skin and like I said, it's not an easy watch. Whatever the case, it's an excellent movie. Not just a horror movie, but a movie.",9,3,5,5 January 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," This movie doesn't think you're an idiot.
","When I saw that Doug Liman was directing and McQuarrie penning, I was interested. I liked Liman's first Bourne film over Greengrass-directed nauseating shaky-cam sequels. McQuarrie is a wonderful screenwriter, and these two seemed like a perfect pair.I got what I hoped: a movie that doesn't treat me like a 10-year old. 'Edge of tomorrow' is smart, entertaining, exciting and fun. It's an original movie as well, not a sequel or a remake (although I hear it might be inspired by a novel or graphic novel).Tom Cruise - who plays a slightly different character than usually - is good, he always brings his best. He cares about his projects and demands to do as much stunts as possible. His passion can be seen here too and he is again a joy to watch, but this isn't a movie for Cruise to carry. Liman and McQuarrie carry this movie with smart pacing, transitions and that certain magic good filmmakers seem to be able to harness at will.Emily Blunt isn't a useless sidekick, but a strong and likable character. Not annoyingly strong on the surface like some feminist ball-busting fantasy, but a real character and deserves every minute of her screen time. Bill Paxton was fun to see as a hard-ass sergeant, and Brendan Gleeson was good as well - even though his screen time is limited. All the main actors work well together, if a scene is shared.The movie flows in an interesting way and it likes to surprise you. I'm not talking about forced twists, I'm talking about that special situation where you don't know what happens next. I've missed that feeling. I didn't have to pretend to care about the movie, I was interested in every minute of it. This happens rarely. And when it ends, you're satisfied. No setting up sequels, no ambiguous crap, just a solid, fitting ending.Unlike Cruise's last sci-fi film 'Oblivion', this is definitely an action movie. At first glance it may look like a generic sci-fi action film - and granted, sometimes (suits, aliens) it does - but there's enough personality of its own. Action looks good and the camera doesn't shake around senselessly. Also, the action never goes into that overblown mode where your senses get tired and you just don't care anymore. Well done.'Edge of tomorrow' is a thoroughly entertaining film. It's 'just' a summer movie, but it's a smart, fun and exciting summer movie. You don't have to make excuses for its shortcomings to enjoy it. It's quality filmmaking and certainly a positive surprise.9/10, will buy on blu-ray. I recommend this to everyone. Avoid as much spoilers as you can.",9,576,672,4 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," So, the prequel trilogy is over.
","This movie basically did what is was supposed to do - end the latest trilogy with some serious action. Pretty much everything I wanted to see in this movie was implanted. Not with passion, not with surprises, not with movie magic but nevertheless it was there. I wanted it to be something more, but it is what it is.This was a movie I would have loved to love, as well as the two first ones. The Star Wars - saga is so huge and means so much for me that at times I felt I truly loved this film. But that's just my love over the whole saga and the story, not the movie itself. It's the power of denial at work.Many things were just wrong. I can't imagine how some of the dialoque got through. And the acting, well...I really can't blame the actors, because George Lucas is not a good director when it comes to acting. Ewan McGregor is a good actor, and he pretty much does what he can to keep things, if not great, then at least OK. Samuel L. Jackson also delivered what he could. Palpatine hammed it up, I enjoyed that. Many others, including Portman - ugh.Also, many times it seemed that special FX were brought to the screen at the cost of the story. It didn't matter what happened and how it happened, as long as it looked cool and expensive. Again, many non-necessary and stupid scenes have found their way to the final version. It looks like a video game too often, and much of the potential and intensity is lost. It's a thing that happens without much effect on the viewer.The last fight in the end was great at times, and not-so great at times. Although I really liked how it ended, the lava-stream scene where they jumped on floating things and tried to fight and 'talk' at the same time, was pointless. It also didn't help how the final fight got interrupted about 15 times to show us something uninteresting. This should've been the most intense fight of the whole saga, but instead it felt like several scattered cutscenes of a video game.Hey, this is Star Wars, at least on the surface. I fell in love with Star Wars as a kid, and I can't say that I'm angry. Disappointed with the prequels? Yes, but...I guess at this point I let the apathy in and I just took whatever Lucas threw at me. If I didn't have any feelings towards the whole original trilogy, I would say this is a useless movie. Somehow the greatness of the originals manages to lift this up from a well of feces into mediocrity. For others it's the opposite, and I understand them well.Even if I hope that many things were done differently, I can still somewhat enjoy this. The child within me was at times satisfied, the adult version of me was bored and disillusioned. But hey, I got to see Obi-Wan fight Anakin, Yoda fight the clones and the Emperor, Mace Windu fight the Emperor too. That's something. Much of it is emotionless digital glimmer with a horribly written plot around it, but it's still something. I must have lowered the bar after episodes one and two.I got what I expected. This is what the movie is. You will see what you expect. It is stale, it is passionless, but it delivers the scenes it needs to.George Lucas, don't direct or directly influence any movie ever again - but thank you for what you did early in your career. Whatever fresh passion you had, you surely lost it. But without you we wouldn't have Star Wars. I would like to live in a world without these prequels, but I wouldn't want to live in a world without the 1977 film. Even if you tried to butcher that one too with the new 'additions'. Come on, man.",5,1,3,9 June 2006
Inception," Where's the imagination?
","There's a lot to like about this film, and even more about the potential. The concept is so good. The cast is fine, writer/director is capable and there's also a big budget. You get to think, you get to feel and you get a little mystery too....but in the end I was somewhat disappointed. After all, this is a movie about dreams. In dreams, everything can happen. What a perfect opportunity to give us a wondrous world full of different, exciting implications. So why did we get tired gunfights? Did 'Inception' really warrant a snowmobile action scene? No, it didn't. And considering that Nolan isn't exactly the best director for action scenes, it's not that engaging. Often I felt like I was watching a video game. And in movies like this, videogames are the last things I want to be reminded of. When imagination is used, I'm all in. I like those few scenes, I like all the possibilities and that certain wondrous element this movie sometimes presents us. There were some good ideas, others were just quickly touched and that was it. When imagination is not used, much of the potential goes down the drain and old bastards like me get tired. When imagination is not used, there's a lot of things happening at once to distract the viewer (me) from how shallow the movie often is.It's not all just about imagination (or lack of it) though, there's also drama. DiCaprio and Cotillard serve as a very qualified backbone to the drama arc. I loved their moments together and their little mystery, and I hoped there would've been more of it. It's not all wasted, but there was potential for more. Especially when the main plot or the main objective of the group is about corporations, and you can't get more non-personal, distanced and less emotionally involved than that. Nolan's focus was on things I didn't care about instead of other way around. Hardy, Page and Gordon-Levitt are...they're just there either for exposition or some action scenes. I won't say they're wasted on this film, but they just weren't interesting as characters. They could've easily been replaced with less known actors and the movie would've been just the same.This isn't a bad movie. As I said, there's lot to like. But I can't help but feel disappointed over the potential this movie had. Even the ambiguous ending felt forced and lazy. Sometimes it works (check out 'Kill list'), in this case I just felt cheated. It certainly feels like this movie is highly overrated, but 'everything Nolan does must be genius' is the popular opinion nowadays. Inception is far from genius and far from a masterpiece, but a worthy movie nevertheless.",6,1,1,26 November 2013
Arrival," It's beautiful.
","I don't mean just the cinematography when I say that 'Arrival' is a beautiful movie, even though the movie surely looks good and visually portrays everything exactly as it intends to, but it's beautiful at its core - the story and the emotions it evokes in the process. I don't want to spoil anything and I'd advise you to refrain from watching any trailers to avoid spoilers. 'Arrival' is both sci-fi and drama, very well shot and mostly well paced. It is not an action movie. Director Denis Villeneuve does not disappoint, and he's becoming my favorite working film director very fast. There's one thing that he excels at - building the tension and emotional stakes in a way that's admirable. He doesn't need to use obvious exposition or action set pieces to make a point. Nothing has to be spelled out for the audience (although some things in this movie are), and he can just let the moments speak for themselves. It's really subtle and effective at the same time without going full art-house. 'Arrival' is sometimes subtle, sometimes not, but it absolutely nails the story it's trying to tell. The original story (called 'Story of Your Life') is written by Ted Chiang and Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay. I haven't read either, but based on this movie, the material might be very good.Amy Adams plays the main role as a linguistics expert. She is very good, and there is that certain kind of confused melancholy she needs to convey through her expressions alone, and she nails it. All other roles could have been played by anyone. I'm not saying that everyone else is bad (I do like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker), I'm saying that there was no room for anyone else to shine - and in this case, it's a positive. It's essential for the focus and the narrative, and the movie works partly because of it. Amy Adams is at the forefront and center and she's very good. With lesser talent, the story would have lost much of its impact.The story is great. It's simple, both emotional and intellectual, and it has layers. It's told well, it's not overly ambiguous, it's not too grand and it's certainly not pretentious. Some people are saying that this movie is hard to understand, but I don't think that's the case. Some people will be disappointed about the lack of explosions and action, and will find 'Arrival' boring. At times it can be kind of boring, but in the right way. There's intensity to it even when nothing is seemingly happening and the story is dished out to you in ways you don't even understand right away, which again goes to show how good Denis Villeneuve is at what he does.The intellectual sci-fi part of the story is about communication, our concept of language and even the restraints that language can instill into our capability to imagine foreign concepts when we're dealing with something very difficult to interpret, something very alien. The emotional part is something very humane and also about having difficulties about understanding something: understanding life, love and death and the meanings we try to assign to those things because we just can't be at peace with them.After leaving the theater, I've been in a melancholic, ponderous state of mind, thinking about the very basic human emotions and questions. Mostly love, death, and the simple things in between. I probably sound like a hipster now, but don't worry, this is not a pretentious hipster movie. It just strikes through that certain psychological barricade many of us have built for ourselves, and makes us really feel something pure again, like children. Even if those pure things can be quite sad.If I have to complain about something, It'd be for just a few things: at some point of the movie, we get narration from a character we'd never expect. I don't like narration in movies, and I don't like narrative changes from one character to another. It's not a big deal, it doesn't last long and it also works in favor of the movie (info dump for the audience), but it felt a little off and made the pacing feel weird for a while. There was also a short subplot to create excitement, and it felt unnaturally rushed and simple when compared to the rest of the movie. That's it, no more gripes. Visually, this movie is great. It's not trying to impress you, it's not about some forced 'look at what we can do' imagery, but simple, beautiful and effective as means to tell a story and set up a mood. Cinematography is great, the effects are good and everything works together.Prepare your ears for beautiful, haunting sounds and music. Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' can very well make some of you cry (and some of you will also recognize it from 'Shutter Island'), and otherwise the score is full of atmosphere and ambiance when it needs that punch. Sound engineers deserve some credit too, because there are some very interesting sound effects in this movie. Saying anything about them could be considered a spoiler, so I won't.I thought 'Hacksaw Ridge' would be my favorite movie of this year, but after seeing 'Arrival' I'm not so sure anymore. Both are great in very different ways. This one is certainly more subdued and artistic, but both have lots of beauty and impact to them. The impact of 'Arrival' isn't a punch to the face, immediately felt, while 'Arrival' will grow on you. I've been thinking about it for a few hours now after seeing it, and it just feels better and better. Recommended for anyone who wants their sci-fi to be about human emotions and drama, not about flashing lights. I can take both, but I'm glad how this one turned out. It's a beautiful, touching story with interesting sci-fi elements.",9,4,10,4 December 2016
The Conjuring," Not quite what I hoped, but nevertheless a damn solid horror movie
","Just finished watching 'The Conjuring', only now did I get the blu-ray.Since I wasn't among the first people to see this in the theaters, my expectations were a little skewed. I was hearing and reading about this film being an instant classic and how terrifying this movie is. Naturally I let myself to expect the most horrifying (in a good way) thing anyone's ever put on screen. That wasn't the case, and I would advise to adjust any expectations accordingly. Looks like this film created a hype that became its own worst enemy. That said, I was still pretty tense the whole time, enjoyed the ride and not once did my attention or interest falter.Think of 'The Conjuring' as a mosaic. It has many elements of all the classic demonic/poltergeist/paranormal/witchcraft movies. It is not original at all, but it is so well made that it deserves some serious compliments. These are my compliments: <ul><li>The movie takes its time. The first hour is basically just setting up the last part of the movie. But it's never boring. Fans of more slow-paced storytelling will like the first hour and the way that the mood is built, and fans of 'crapload of stuff happening all at once' can enjoy the hectic 3rd act. I think the film lost a little of its magic in the end, but you may think otherwise.</li></ul><ul><li>Absence of many annoying clichés. There really aren't that many jumpscares. And when they do happen, it's not the old 'camera turning with a person it follows while zooming into a scary face' - trick. We don't get stupid characters doing stupid things or overly skeptic people that need to be constantly convinced that something out of this world is really happening. We don't get a forced twist to the mystery in the end, the whole mystery is pretty much clear a little over halfway into the movie. Also, the ending rewards the viewer. Wow, never thought that would happen.</li></ul><ul><li>Visuals and sound. The movie is set in 1970's, and it's a wonderful choice. The house, the clothes, the equipment, everything is as it should be so the setting itself is great. Add some nice camera work, good lighting, some freaky make-up and we're good to go. The overall 'style' is just right and handled well. When you watch this movie, be sure to have the volume up. The sound department did a fantastic job, and I can't stress this enough: turn the volume up.</li></ul><ul><li>I did like the cast. Even Ron Livingston. But Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and the ever beautiful Vera Farmiga get the biggest thumbs up. Surprisingly, the child actors didn't suck. Some of them were pretty good. They don't steal the show, but they manage well. From the older 'children', Hayley McFarland again plays a younger person that she really is, but she fooled me.</li></ul>The characters add a nice contrast to each other. We have the troubled owners of the house and the couple investigating the phenomenon, which gives us a channel to change perspectives as viewers. Nothing in it seems out of place even though we've seen this before. I don't buy the 'based on true events' - claim though. I won't laugh at people who do, but it had no effect on my experience or this review.The script is tight enough, and James Wan's directing is worthy of a couple pats on the back. This movie doesn't treat you like an idiot, and it isn't cheap on what it does. This is pure old-school, both in horror and filmmaking department.This movie has pretty much everything in it except gore, and it doesn't feel like a crammed-together mosaic even though that's probably what it is. I don't really know what to call this film myself, but I know that it works. It didn't shock me like no other movie, it didn't make me want to weep in the corner, but I was still captured the whole time. I guess I was just waiting for something phenomenally scary to happen and blow my mind, but in the end all I got was a 'very good, solid horror movie'. It felt like 'The Conjuring' climbed effortlessly pretty high on a mountain, but never reached the top. I've seen tons of horror films and I recognize I might be desensitized at this point, but still that magical cherry on top of the cake was missing for me.'Sinister' and 'Insidious' are some of my favorite modern horror movies, and 'The Conjuring' is right up there with them. None of them are perfect nor terrifying beyond belief, but I would recommend them all to fans of possession/haunted house genre. 'The Conjuring' is probably the most down-to-earth horror film of them all, and thus easier to accept. Even if I didn't get the magical masterpiece I was hoping for, I got a really good one. I have a habit of being easy on horror movies I like, so if you're not exactly a fan of the genre, feel free to take a couple points off.",9,1,1,19 December 2013
Prometheus," Good outweighs the bad, one of the best big sci-fi movies in years
","I've seen this about six times on blu-ray now. I was originally so anxious to see 'Prometheus', considering how much I love 'Alien'. It wasn't the masterpiece I hoped. It has noticeable flaws. Nonetheless, there's also so much good in it that I can't help but approve despite of some gripes.I'll go through the gripes that I have. 1) Yes, some characters are idiots in certain situations. It's also true that the expedition in 'Prometheus' was supposed to be a disaster, and a bad decision does not make a bad character, but I still would've hoped a little more. Sometimes some characters, while they're at times fun and interesting, are handled like cheap plot devices. A couple of things still make me want to facepalm (Theron's last scene). Another thing, some lines in the dialogue are just...I don't know should I say bad or weird, because sometimes there is a line that doesn't make much sense other than for dramatization purposes, as if to make a conversation seem deeper than it really is. Again, it does feel cheap how some characters are handled sometimes. This is not to say that the main characters don't have any depth or intelligence, they do to some extent, and that's a contrast which is hard to get used to. It helps when you keep in mind their main characteristics, for example the lead scientists are young and very naive in their enthusiasm. 2) There are some problems with the narrative and pacing. While the film rolls along rather effectively, and I do like the storyline, some corners are cut short. The 'science' in this movie is often very questionable. Some things are too simplified (heavy suspension of disbelief warranted) while others are the exact opposite - and again this can make it hard for people to invest themselves. I would've preferred the movie to be a little longer and the narrative to be deeper and more detailed with more room to breathe. That certain gripping focus on the essential seems to me missing at times.--------That's it. Those are my problems. There probably are more questions in the end than there was in the beginning, but I like that. Sequel is in the works, and it's such a compelling, fascinating universe that 'Prometheus' has built that it's impossible to explore themes this huge properly and wrap it all up at once without screwing it up. About the main themes, I love them. Creators and the created. Shaw (Noomi Rapace) goes searching for her makers, but still holds on to her religion. Android David-9 (Michael Fassbender) knows his creators, but he's still missing something. It's a theme that's explored in many levels. Hubris is another theme. It's everywhere. Not going to say more about that, better to let everyone see and ponder it themselves. Some characters have motivations that are not spoon-fed, and it makes the movie (along with impressive visuals and setting up a fascinating world) very re-watchable. I started writing this review at the middle of my 7th viewing.I love the world Prometheus gives us. It's dark, fascinating to no end, and that certain H.R. Giger - like design is still there to some extent. The interiors, the creatures, the designs, the sets...they're amazing. I like the storyline too. It all gives a boost to your imagination and you start to wonder, to really wonder like a child. You want to know everything, you want to understand as much as possible, it's all so well done and so captivating. This leads many to disappointment, because certain questions will linger. I felt that too, but at the same time I've grown to like the mystery and to craft my own theories. We'll see where the sequel leads us.I don't exactly love CGI above anything else, but this is possibly the most stunning blu-ray movie I have seen. It looks that good, just brilliant execution. Ridley Scott always handles these things well. I still haven't seen anything this impressive visually after I saw this for the first time. Ten out of ten.Michael Fassbender steals the show, great job. He's becoming one of my favorite actors. Noomi Rapace is...OK in my mind. Certainly not bad, delivers a nice performance, but the impact could've been bigger. Then again it's easy to get overshadowed by Fassbender's character and the script didn't give Rapace that much to impress people. Theron's supporting role is somewhat limited, as is Pearce's, and they neither bother me nor impress me. Idris Elba on the other hand, he nails his small role and he's got that magical presence that makes any movie better.This movie captivates me. Ridley Scott didn't direct a masterpiece and there surely are annoyances, but what he managed to deliver he delivered well. Sometimes I snap out of the immersion due to some weak character handling, dialogue or cutting some corners shot, but the movie always wins me back. The engineers and their world, all the weird surroundings and their mysteries are so well crafted that even though I notice the flaws as clearly as I'd notice one of my legs missing, I want to dive back into that world. I know I will have to forgive some things along the way, but that's the price I'm willing to pay. As much as some criticism is warranted, so is praise. The film's capability of being thoroughly thought-provoking is an achievement as is the exciting world it presents us. Am I making excuses for this movie, and is it just my inner child who wants 'Prometheus' to be something more than it really is? It's certainly possible. Only time will tell.",8,2,8,21 August 2013
The Wolverine," The better Wolverine adventure
","I liked this, a lot. After the letdown of X3 and Origins movies, this was called for. I wanted this. It's not everything it could have been, but I'll take it gladly. I saw in the theatre, and now I saw the extended cut on blu-ray.This movie tries to examine Logan's soul and basically his reasons to live. Why would he want to live (almost) forever? He's basically a drifter now, without purpose. Who/what is he and what does it take to find himself? Sadly, it's not as deep as I'm making it seem, but the core of the idea is put out there and also handled in a satisfactory manner. He lost his love (Famke Janssen's Jean Grey) in X3, and it haunts him. He has constant nightmares. At this point, many readers will get cautious. Don't worry, it's nothing cheesy as in X3 or Origins. The dreams deepen the story and Logan's motivations while fitting perfectly into the narrative. Oh yes, the narrative. I like it. It's always present, be it a dream sequence, an action scene, a conversation scene or just plain exposition in various methods, it always furthers the story and most of the time (excluding the last act) it feels like a 'real movie' instead of 'just' a comic book movie. At times, s*** hits the fan and action starts, then it cools down again and lets us breathe, but it never feels rushed or prolonged. Everything in the pacing just seems to fit. I would also like to compliment the score, I even got a certain melody playing in my head after seeing the movie. Marco Beltrami, well done.The action. Sometimes, there was a little too much shaky cam. Otherwise, love it. For a PG-13 film, there's a lovely amount of blood and that certain nasty grit (extended, unrated version has more blood and longer battles). Wolverine gets hurt a lot, and he hurts others a lot. There's one train scene that is impressive and memorable, but I liked the plain good old man-to-man fights the best.The setting is different, and it's beautiful. Japan. You get some nice scenery, along with some old- and newschool Japanese architecture. Yes, you get samurai/ninja fights (one of them is clearly cut short, but included in the unrated cut). Not only just scenery and fights, but characters too. What I like about this movie is that it takes not only Logan, but the closest characters to him seriously. Yukio and Mariko (Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto, both starring in their first feature film) were two characters I really liked, and both are handled well, not just as props in a Wolverine movie. I became fond of them, especially Yukio who gets to have some nice action too. I would've liked Mariko to be more memorable, but at least she feels like a real person. The whole Japanese cast is good. Well done, thumbs up.This movie is not perfect though, although I absolutely feel the need to see it again. Even though this is not a X-men movie but a Wolverine movie, he won't be the only mutant. One especially just...feels like doesn't fit in well, and most people who have seen the movie know who I'm talking about. I'm not sure if it's the character itself or the actor, but I didn't care much for it. Don't worry though, it doesn't ruin the movie and this isn't a mutant fest, this is Wolverine's movie. Also, at the end things go a little crazy. Certainly nothing compared to what can happen in movies of this genre, but doesn't fit in well with the more realistic, more mature nature of the first 3/4 of this movie. Some may like it though, and even I can't say that I hate the final act, it just felt like a little stretch concerning the tone shift.Another thing that can be a problem for some: It's not a mind-bending spectacle and certainly nothing of grand epic proportions happens (except for the very nice opening scene). In a way it's smallish in scale and just does what it sets out to do: gives us a pretty good Wolverine movie. It doesn't try to impress you that much, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're looking for. Anyway, I came out of the theater a little underwhelmed, but still very satisfied. Wolverine's character was handled well. The story took its time and was paced nicely, cinematography was good, most characters were treated with respect, action was thrilling at times. In addition to that, the Jean Grey - love interest (which I wasn't a big fan of in the first place) gets finally wrapped up in a satisfying manner and perhaps I can now watch the dreaded X3 again without so many grievances.I'll be honest: I'd probably give this a 6, if I could be neutral enough. If you take Wolverine out of the movie and replace him with John Doe, It would only be decent, even though it has the 'real movie' feel to it. However, I'm just glad I got to see a Wolverine movie I can honestly like and respect - thus the rating of 8. The overall quality is certainly there. James Mangold is a good director, he knows how to construct a story and put it on the screen. This is the work of a good filmmaker.The extended cut is worth it, though it doesn't improve the movie in itself but adds some nice touches here and there.Reminder: don't miss the mid-credits scene at the end. Days of Future Past is around the corner.",7,4,9,12 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Basically a decent movie, but something's off.
","(only minor spoilers ahead) First of all: yes, it has good moments, and it's at least a mediocre Batman film. There's easily three movies' worth of material here. It looks (mostly) good. The characters are (mostly) good...and yet I can't love it. I liked Batman Begins a lot, and loved The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight rises is something I do like at times, but would've wanted to like more.These are my main problems: <ul><li>There's just too much going on. It's hard for me to emotionally invest myself into something particular, when there's 300 subplots (some of which I didn't care about too) going on. I don't mean it's too hard for me to grasp, but there's just too much stuff for this film to have a bigger impact on me. Thus some big scenes and plot twists just...they just go by, often rendering each other useless and I feel nothing. This has an effect to everything. This movie tries too damn much, and it certainly shows.</li></ul><ul><li>Alfred's character. Caine is a remarkable actor and once again delivers, but something is off with the writing. It's a full 180 from TDK's 'Be the Batman, Gotham needs Batman, Endure good sir!' to 'You're done, I can't stand to lose you, let the people handle themselves'. I can't get over this, especially considering how important character Alfred is and how he's usually involved in setting up the certain mood/theme for every Nolan's Batman movie. Funny, because this movie, much like Alfred, can't really handle things.</li></ul><ul><li>This is a minor thing, I know. Shames me to even say this, but...some visual concerns. Not the CGI, more like artistic choices. Batman looks more silly than ever in his costume, especially in daylight. Less shadows, less cape, more funny-looking plates and armor. Another minor gripe: yes, the voice. Especially when talking to people who know his identity.</li></ul>Often this movie just didn't reach that 'Batman feel', even if I wanted it to. It's also sad that the more I watch it, the less I like it. The positives? Exactly what people tell you. Bane was sometimes at least a very interesting character, some elements of the basic running story is adequate (though plenty of stupidities), some settings are impressive, some dialogue is good, technically this movie is well done. Absolutely not a shitty movie, but disappointing to say the least. I just can't throw superlatives on this one. It's not The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises is my least favorite of the three (which can be translated to 'It's still a good trilogy').",6,1,3,31 July 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," I had to forgive a lot with this one.
","The best action movies were made in the 80's. Die Hard was among them. While the sequels (especially Die Hard 2) didn't improve on the first one - which isn't exactly a flaw, since the first one is a classic and almost impossible to top - they did have that certain grit and 80's feel to them.With Die Hard 4.0 (sigh, that's what it's called here in the nordics), I had to forgive a lot of things in the movie to enjoy it. I still haven't found the non-PG13 blu-ray with finnish subtitles, so currently I'm stuck with the theatrical release.These are my gripes: <ul><li>PG13 is useless. The trend to release everything in PG13 is insulting to action movie lovers. I don't even know what bothers me the most, the awkward and awful almost-cursing ('jerkoff!') or the lack of brutal, impactful violence. The way the movie is cut somehow does seem to make up for the lack of blood without totally losing the impact, but anyway these are significant shortcomings for me.</li></ul><ul><li>John McClane is not a superhero nor should be treated as such. When I think about my favorite scenes from the three previous movies, I never (not even once) thought that 'hey, this scene would be better if that guy fought a jet'. It's not the SCALE of things that made the first film a genre classic, it was a very confined environment with a lot of simple battles.</li></ul>-------------Those are my gripes with Die Hard 4, and I'm not alone with them. Anyway, onto the good stuff. The story is decent enough. Willis is still (mostly) okay, and there's something about Timothy Olyphant that I can't quite grasp. I love watching the guy, yet his character doesn't seem really menacing. I don't fear him, I don't even hate him that much, but I want to watch him. It's weird in a positive way for me. Justin long manages fine as a stuttering sidekick/exposition device. Kevin Smith was a nice surprise.The action is (minus the ridiculous jet scene) passable for a PG13 flick. Lots of cool moves and stunts, won't complain. I thought the movie got gradually a little bit worse as it progressed, but the surprisingly good start (apartment shootout scene) somehow carried the rest of the movie.I still probably like this more than Die Hard 2, but then again the PG13-rating can, in time, make me change my mind. Naturally the first and third are superior to both Die Hard 2 and this one.This could've been a pretty awesome action film if treated properly. A solid R-rating from the beginning, tighter script with more tense action without certain ridiculous 'big' scenes, a more interested Bruce Willis...but the ship sailed. Die Hard 4 is OK, if you're willing to forgive some of its shortcomings.I skipped Die Hard 5. Everything that people say (read a lot of reviews here on IMDb, had some friends even warn me not to see it) makes me not want to see it. And I won't, I don't hate myself that much.If the producers/filmmakers/Bruce remember or care about what's good in this franchise to begin with and deliver a good sixth entry, I will give that one a chance. I'm not holding my breath.",7,2,3,26 November 2013
X2: X-Men United," Best of the franchise to date, and best of any superhero movies.
","This was the one, that made me wait for X3 like something I never waited before. X3 proved to be a disappointment, but this was excellent. Marvellous.The overall 'feel' of the film is just great. It's a little dark, dark enough to exploit the drama, leaving room for lighter moments instead of going on full depression mode. Everything has its place and I really felt we weren't being force-fed anything. The balance was just right and the pacing was spot on. The plot, the locations, the characters, the action - couldn't have asked for more. Emotional too, very emotional. At the end I think I cried a bit like a little mindless fanboy. The characters are really alive in this one. We get a lot of really cool scenes from Wolverine, Magneto, Xavier, Lady 'not really deathstrike' Deathstrike, Mystique, Pyro and Nightcrawler. The Phoenix storyline was set up well - even if X3 eventually did what it did. Some characters, even few of my favorites, didn't get much screen time, but even the short scenes they had were handled with care.Singer is one hell of a guy creating suspense and developing characters especially when he's working on an X-men movie. Yes, I liked 'Usual suspects' and even 'Valkyrie', but you got to admit that superhero movies are very challenging to make in a lot of different ways. And while I don't consider him as an action director, the action scenes have that much more of an impact when we really care about what's happening. Acting is mostly top-notch. From the new cast members Brian Cox especially stood out and continued the tradition of (mostly) excellent casting in X-men movies. The first film was also good and I liked it, but this one was just pure greatness. To this day, X2 remains as the best superhero movie I have ever seen. I can not find such flaws or shortcomings from it that I can find from other superhero movies. And yes, I have seen The Dark Knight, First Class and The Avengers.I'm not going to say it's a perfect movie, but as an X-men movie it comes very, very close. Considering it was made 10 years ago and still holds up today...definitely an achievement. I can only hope that upcoming 'Days of Future Past' comes even close to this. If that happens, I'll be more than happy.(If it didn't translate well - yes, I like X-men a lot. If you, the reader, aren't so much into these films, take a couple points off my review. Still, I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone who's even a little bit interested in this kind of fantasy)",10,0,0,31 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I'm happy for the younger generation.
","I was a kid in the early '80s when I first saw Star Wars. I remember how it felt. I got to see the unaltered theatrical versions, the original movie magic. When Lucas introduced the prequel trilogy as well as the altered versions of the original ones almost 20 years ago, suddenly the magic was gone. Everything was not only digital, but shallow, dull and passionless. I felt for the kids. And for myself, because when it comes to Star Wars, I always want to be a kid. With the prequels, I became a critical adult. There was no magic. There was no wonder, no joy, no heartfelt moments.I have just seen Episode VII: The Force Awakens, and let me tell you: I feel like that kid again. This movie has sense of adventure, likable heroes, genuinely funny moments, excitement and heart. Yes, heart. I got choked up and teary. I feel happy, but not only for myself. I feel happy for the kids who get to see a real, good Star Wars movie in a theater. It's been over 30 years since the last time that happened.That said, I can criticize this movie like an adult. I love it, but I can also see the machinery behind it. The structure is very familiar. If you know episodes IV-VI by heart, you will recognize almost every scene being a rehash of some of the old ones. I'm not only talking about throwbacks and winks (of which there are plenty), but the general scene composition and acts themselves. Our new heroine is pretty much a female Luke Skywalker too, so things are extremely familiar. It can be said that there is very little new to this movie, and it will bother some people.I could easily take the overabundance of familiarity without getting bothered. It didn't feel as though director Abrams was out of ideas or ambition. It didn't feel like a cynical cash-grab. It felt like the movie was making me comfortable and setting my worries aside. The movie was saying: 'This is what you love. Here it is. Welcome back'.I really liked the actors. I had concerns before seeing the movie, but they were soon put to rest. Daisy Ridley as Rey was excellent. Even though she is basically a female version of Luke Skywalker, she feels natural. She is extremely likable and nails her part. She had a few exciting and heartfelt moments too. John Boyega was just right, and even surprisingly funny. Adam Driver was great as Kylo Ren, and Oscar Isaac was fine as the hotshot pilot. The torches have been passed, and the torchbearers are chosen well.But what about the old cast? Was Harrison Ford tired? Harrison Ford was one of the highlights. He wasn't phoning it in, and I just loved how Han Solo felt like Han Solo, instead of Harrison Ford playing Han Solo against his will. The least recognizable was Carrie Fisher's Leia, but she was good as well, delivering a warm performance. I won't say anything about Mark Hamill to avoid spoilers, but I loved what I saw.The characters played off of each other. Many quips and fast exchanges. It felt, at times, like an old Indiana Jones movie where characters would have lots of back-and-forth. This movie knows when to relax with the dialogue and when to take it more slowly and carefully. Everything feels natural and fitting to an adventure movie like this.We get to see Chewie, C-3PO and R2D2 again. All of it feels natural, none of it is crammed in just for the sake of cramming it in. Chewie was excellent and he got to see some nice action, but guess who was simply great? BB-8, the small cutesy droid. There is plenty of humor involved with BB-8, but it doesn't annoy you. I thought of Wall-E at some point, because it felt like BB-8 had that same kind of innocent charm. No Jar-Jar Binks material here, don't be afraid. All of the cute moments are genuinely cute.The pacing is fast. It's not too fast so that you will understand what is happening, and it does give the most important scenes a little breathing room, but when it starts it never stops. It's an adventure movie and it feels like it. It will not bore you with some space politics, and it takes itself just seriously enough hitting that sweet spot that is very easy to miss.Williams' music is excellent as always. There were probably some new tunes, but they didn't stick with me like the old themes - which are naturally used here too. I will see this movie many more times, so we'll see if I missed some gems.Is this movie a masterpiece? As much as I like it, it is not. It is a masterpiece of winning the audience back and pleasing a crowd, but not as a construct of art. In these kinds of movies, many things will breeze by since the focus is on the adventure and simple character moments. The story isn't very intelligent or even that elaborate. The nostalgia factor - even though I loved it - can be considered as playing things too safe. I like this movie, but I don't have to lie about it. How to summarize? The movie is extremely familiar. It's the first of a new trilogy, so not all questions will be answered. Still, it managed to feel like a whole movie of its own, and won be back from the cynical dark side where the prequels had driven me. I felt excitement, I felt joy, and as I left the theater I was both satisfied and eager to see the next installment as soon as possible. That is a great accomplishment. The next episode will have to tell a new story and be a little bolder, but right now...I feel like I'm home.",8,3,18,17 December 2015
Godzilla," Just got back from the theater.
","Well, well. I'll say this first: I haven't seen the Japanese original nor the sequels. I've only seen the horrible abomination from 1998. This one is naturally better, but I want you (the reader) to know that I'm not familiar with everything Godzilla.Monster movies seem to have a pattern. There is always a family, some military involvement and the works. 'Godzilla' is not an exception. What is exceptional though, is the way these things were handled. Yes, sometimes I cringed at some family matters, but other times (especially when Cranston was on screen) I was almost moved.Bryan Cranston naturally does fine, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the lead. He is the character that is everywhere at almost all times. He's sometimes more of a plot vehicle than a character, and this movie isn't surely worth watching because of him, but at least he didn't annoy me as much as I feared and the movie managed to get to the point I was waiting for without making me hate the wait. Ken Watanabe, too, is handled mainly as an exposition machine or is tasked with setting up the mood, but he's always enjoyable to watch and when he's on screen everything feels a lot better.The monsters, what they are and what they do, are set up well enough. We get some impressive visuals and decent build-up even before the first full-on action scene. The creatures are introduced nicely, and when they get to business, it's all nice to watch.Godzilla is of course the main character, and many people complain that he isn't shown much in this film. That is not a moot criticism, and I understand that. However I enjoyed our hero of a monster more this way. When he WAS on screen, it was more special and worth the wait.While this is (at least on the human side) a fairly serious movie, I found something uplifting in the monster action itself. Little boy inside this grown man cheered, and even though a lot of buildings and property got smashed, I didn't get tired or annoyed about it like in, say, Man of Steel. There is childish excitement to be found in this movie, even though you'd have to wait for it some time.My only criticisms are these: the tired family/military-portion of the monster movie formula (while not nearly as bad as I feared), and sometimes the pounding score didn't know when to stop and let our ears take a breather. Because when it did stop in the middle of chaos, the silence was eerily beautiful. I wish we would've had more of that important contrast.I'd recommend this as a theater experience, not sure if I'll eventually buy the blu-ray because I don't feel like seeing this again. Anyway, some gripes aside, 'Godzilla' provides a fun movie experience and washes away some of the bad taste you got in your mouth (brain) from the 1998 version.",7,31,61,19 May 2014
Looper," So much potential. So much.
","There will be some spoilers. I assume the reader already knows what the movie is about.That one scene. In the diner, where present and future Joe are talking to each other. Great scene, and I felt the amazing potential right there. Older Joe who has changed his ways, mourning a love that changed his life. Younger Joe, not caring about anything. The importance and fragility of memories, and what it means in their situation. That alone would make an amazing story, and it is the best scene in the movie. Imagine the possibilities.Instead, the older Joe suddenly loses his charm and 'warmth', turns out to be an almost sociopathic asshole who really doesn't care about anything else than getting his woman back. This development is too sudden, weak and does not follow the themes so strongly present in the diner scene, and I have to blame the writing. At some point, they decided that meaningful themes have now been taken care of, so let's get to some crime lord/X-men stuff - all things I didn't care about AT ALL at that point, and not much more even later on. Big mistake. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, but I weep for the lost potential. 'Looper' sets itself up to be a little gem and then...hngh.Younger Joe becomes the 'good guy', not at all from his older self's influence, but just because. In the end, the 'memories can be altered'-thing doesn't apparently even matter (younger Joe loving Emily Blunt's character, realizing the situation they are in is screwed) because hey, there has to be a sacrifice so that viewers can get emotional and pretend to cry. It was cutting the corners short, and forced. So forced. I can even forgive some of the Phoenix-kid plot straight from the X-men universe. Mainly because the child actor is pretty good.There's one significant thing about the characters. Both Joes, Emily Blunt's character, the kid...I didn't care about them. I thought both Joes were ultimately shallow and very, very unlikable. I didn't root for either one of them. Blunt was of course pretty and doesn't suck, but again suffers from bad character development and writing. There's some forced dialogue that tries to get you feel for her and deepen the character, but it's done in a very 'let's get this out of the way' - manner. It is possible to do much with very little, but this is not the right attitude. Still, I had more sympathy for her than the main characters. Funny, right? No.How about the 'bad guys'? They're treated the same way, maybe even worse. Charismatic Jeff Daniels along with Noah Segan are set up - much like this movie itself - pretty well. You get interested. Then, nothing. Writer/director Rian Johnson throws them out like garbage without any kind of payoff or satisfaction.The deep, wonderful themes where real emotions, interest and curiosity lie are wasted and instead the movie gives us something much cheaper. Not terrible or awful, but cheap and unambitious. It's as if the writer/director Johnson took someone's half-finished story and then wrote the rest himself. This isn't a bad movie, but it could've been very good. '12 Monkeys' - good if done right. It was on the right track for about 30 minutes. That's why I'm frustrated and right now it makes the bad things and shortcomings seem so unbearable, although in reality I've forgiven a lot worse things with other movies. I probably won't watch this again any time soon. Nevertheless, 'Looper' at least tries to be original and takes itself seriously enough to a point. In a time of remakes, movies like 'Grown ups' and...whatever stinking pile of crap you might run into, that's something to like and for that I give it a 7 instead of 6.",7,0,2,7 August 2013
What We Do in the Shadows," Actually funny, not Hollywood-ish pretend-funny.
","I watched this for the second time last night. I remembered it being alright, but on my second viewing I caught a lot of funny jokes I missed before....and that's what I love about 'What We Do in the Shadows'. It isn't forcing a joke on you. It doesn't rub it in your face. The way the humor is presented is almost natural, and it's ultimately what Hollywood comedies aren't - genuinely funny. So while you may miss some funny things when you watch it the first time, you're still entertained in a way that's rare for comedy movies nowadays. There is a charm to it. I usually dread these kind of fake documentaries, and I don't care for vampires (especially modern takes of them), but my cynicism was soon put to rest. Yes, there's a film crew following and documenting the lives of vampires, and it sounds horrible when simply stated like that, but it's much better than I thought it could be.Jermaine Clement was great, and the main reason I got this film in the first place. But Taika Waititi (co-director, along with Clement), Jonny Brugh and Cori Gonzales-Macuer were very good too. From the side characters Stu Rutherford hilariously seems to play himself, Jackie van Beek is a frustrated slave and Ben Fransham plays a really old vampire, straight from a horror story. Rhys Darby is a likable presence as the werewolf pack leader. All the actors are good, and they mostly play it straight, bordering on deadpan. It was the right decision as far as comedic style goes.What I didn't expect from a movie like this was special effects. This isn't a CGI-fest or effect-heavy like a blockbuster nowadays is, but most of the effects are really good and seamless. There were couple of scenes where I actually started laughing at the effects, because their quality caught me off-guard.If you like funny and weird soundtracks, there's plenty to like in this one. Most of the music is somewhat traditional, almost from another age we have forgot, and it fits perfectly to the tone of the movie. There's also a short, clumsy band act that's complimenting the same weird tone. It's not treated as a joke, on the contrary it's played very straight - but the humor comes in context with everything else.I have something negative to say as well, though it's just nitpicking at this point. The latter half of the film isn't quite as funny, and the narrative took a direction I didn't care that much about. It's still good, but some of the magic is gone. And while I complimented the natural flow of comedy, some of the jokes - especially during the latter half - come off as forced. They stick out like sore thumb, but thankfully they're the exception instead of the rule. That's it, I don't think I have more complaints. 'What We Do in the Shadows' is great. And the more you compare it to modern mainstream comedies, the better it gets. If you're tired of lazy, forced corporate products like the Ghostbusters reboot, Adam Sandler&Kevin James productions, Seth McFarlane flicks or your average frat boy comedies and chick flicks, you'll probably like this one. There wasn't a committee of suits and marketing people behind this one, and it shows. Hollywood, take note before you drown under your own feces.",9,1,3,30 July 2016
Deadpool," It is its own thing.
","I don't read comics. I did when I was a kid, and that was so long ago that I don't want to even think about it. But I've always watched movies, and 'Deadpool' hit a certain nerve in me. In a positive way.Comic book movies seem to be all about franchises nowadays. 'Building a universe'. Setting up sequels, setting up spinoffs, setting up everything - and often forgetting to be a movie on their own, like what arguably happened with 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'.I'm not surprised if Deadpool is heading straight into that circus of brands and formulaic nothingness, because at this point it's clear how successful this movie was. But I can hope for something better, because this movie was actually fun to watch.This film is almost like a parody. It is not only self-aware, but painfully aware of the whole superhero movie business too. Expect some jokes about that. In Deadpool, our main characters often say what the audience is thinking. The fourth wall gets broken, and sometimes the movie feels like it's more of a weird mind game than a movie. The humor doesn't land all of the time, and sometimes it's a bit forced, but I got over it quickly.While 'Deadpool' doesn't take many things seriously, and it sure enough is not a serious movie, it still seems to take itself seriously in what it's trying to do. And somehow it works. R-rated violence, strong language, weird sense of humor and this lack of restraint of course helps, but there is a real heart to this movie that isn't defined by any of these things. Perhaps it's the source material and the respect director Miller, writers Reese+Wernick and actor/producer Reynolds pay to it. Perhaps it's the fact they wanted to make a fun movie, not just something for brand recognition. All I can say is that in a crazy movie like this, I don't expect to see any heartfelt, naturally emotional moments. But I did. This movie has a heart somewhere in it.Reynolds is very entertaining as the main character, and right now I can't see anyone else pulling it off. Well done. Morena Baccarin is good, and the special mention goes to Brianna Hildebrand, I had fun with her playing her role straight in a movie like this. Actors do a fine job, and even the CGI Colossus didn't bother me too much.One hour and a half went by quickly, and I got my money's worth. A simple, tight (albeit a little shallow and stupid) story that has fun with itself and the current state of superhero movies. Not once did I feel like there was a 'message' being pounded to my head, and not once did I feel like I have to suffer formulaic boredom in the name of cinematic universes. Fun fact: No cities get demolished in this movie. I have missed this kind of simplicity, where stories don't revolve around the whole world ending. Not all comic book movies need to have the same threats, same boring and grey 200 million dollar visuals of cities crumbling, and luckily Deadpool steers clear from all that stuff. The ending felt very fitting too, and overall I had a very good time in the theater.'Deadpool' is a weird example of how less is more, and how at the same time daring to cross formulaic boundaries can be rewarding. So I hope that they don't try to 'tame' Deadpool, or try to recreate a formula out of it. Let it be what it is. I don't even know what it is, but I like it this way.",8,5,14,24 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," James Bond doesn't know crazy
","Kingsman, on the other hand, does.Action comedies are hard to make right. Although 'action comedy' doesn't do justice for this movie, nor does the equally vague 'action adventure', but these kinds of movies rarely nail it. They can be easily failures: either they're unfunny or the action doesn't cut it, or they just simply have no heart in whatever they're trying to do. That is not the case here.Kingsman: The Secret Service is unexpectedly fresh for a movie that borrows from just about everything. It's outright ridiculous, and you still manage to care about what's happening. No punches are pulled. It's very violent, very funny in refreshing ways and manages to surprise and entertain you in ways that I thought couldn't be possible anymore. I watched some scenes with my mouth open. I couldn't believe what was happening.How would I describe this movie? Think about James Bond with a fresh sense of fun, silly amounts of amazingly-shot violence, the most ridiculous villain of all time who has a Kill Bill-esque henchwoman, and where you somehow manage to care about some of the characters. It never crosses the line where it becomes either a parody or a serious thriller, it just maximizes the entertainment factor in - it seems - every single scene.Matthew Vaughn is one of the best action movie directors around, because he finds many smart little ways to elevate his movies. Jane Goldman is the co-writer, as usual. These two seem to work amazingly well together. They nailed the tone perfectly and almost every moment seems fitting.Colin Firth is the absolute star of this film. He's every bit as elegant as Bond, even more so. He steals every scene he's in, and to my surprise he delivered the best action scenes of the whole movie too. Amazing job, Colin. Mark Strong and Michael Caine as veteran agents are fine and they elevate any movie they participate in. I can't say a bad thing about anyone else either. Some characters are best left unspoiled - especially Samuel L. Jackson's one. Samantha Womack was very good in a small role, I had to look her up immediately after the movie ended. Overall, the cast was good, and Colin Firth leads the movie like a pro.I can only imagine how much a PG-13 rating would have hindered this gem. Luckily nothing is watered down and we get the full experience.If you like action adventure movies, and especially if you think that action movies have become too formulaic, passionless and dull, I will highly recommend Kingsman for you. This movie seems to find fun and excitement in whatever it does. Get some friends to watch it with you, even. I did.Today, I know what it means to be a true gentleman.",9,5,10,1 September 2015
Fantastic Four," Just crap. People giving 10's? Do they pay you?
","The worst superhero-movie I have ever seen. Definitely. Ever. Daredevil is 10 times better than this. What is with people giving 10's? Feels like cheating or something. Normally I would understand different opinions, but this piece of crap can and will not satisfy anyone who is over 10 years of age and whose brain functions even a little.The plot. I wouldn't care about the plot in this kind of movie so much, but it just stinks. The characters? Well, they suck. Every one of them, the writing and the acting is not B-class, it's F-class. You don't believe the characters. That would be OK, cause this film isn't a serious one, but when the characters make you want to shoot the guys who did this piece of crap, that's another thing.The comics were OK, I used to like them when I was a kid. Now I like them even more, because the fantasy value of the original stories just skyrocketed after seeing this turd. I could list all the illogical holes in the movie, but I got no time for it. There are so many absolutely stupid things and scenes, that it seems impossible. It's just....I can't believe they made this. I didn't expect anything, and still I was angry.The fire effect seemed cool at first. And the thing threw a car. That's it, you could make a video clip out of those things (approx. 8 seconds) and watch it. But don't rent this movie, ever.After the disappointment and confusion I thought about watching it again, just for laughs. If you're watching this during a bad movie - weekend with friends, it will make you laugh.Then again, this movie deserves not even laughter. Just hate. I hate this. Glad X-men and Spiderman did the job right. This one surely didn't.Granted, this rant is more about my disappointment and childish anger than about the movie itself. If I could be totally neutral, I'd probably give this a couple more points.",3,11,20,31 May 2006
Moon," You really do need to see this.
","I try not to give anything away, so no real spoilers here.Remember the great genre classics '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'? Sure you do, as do I, so I was right at home with this film. This is not a straight rip-off by any means of any of those films, but there are certain borrowed elements which you will recognize right away. I like to think that the makers of this movie wanted to tell a story, and at the same time pay their respects for the great classics, and it worked. Duncan Jones has created/directed/co-written a very good story, and I am hoping to see more of his work in the future. The story is simple and engaging. There are a couple of twists, but only to add to the story, not to destroy the last 120 minutes you've seen. 'Moon' is a character-driven movie with a great, simple and nice atmosphere and it's just as much a drama as it is a sci-fi movie. This isn't an action movie, but I believe even people with short attention spans can enjoy 'Moon'. I didn't experience even one boring second, I couldn't even pause the movie and go for a smoke which is a thing I often do. Those looking for hard sci-fi may be disappointed though, because this is a rather simple movie at its heart.Visually 'Moon' does just fine, and there is not a lot of CGI here but more like believable sets, miniature models and the good old stuff. 'Moon' does not look cheap or bad, and everything feels 'right'. You can feel the moon base is the main character's home and you feel the isolation that comes with it. That's something you don't get with money, but with talent and passion. Also, music is very, very good. The themes have a nice feeling to them and the timing is always right. Clint Mansell became one of my favorite composers because of this film - although he's done some really nice work before and after this too.But enough about that, let's get on to what's the movie about. Meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who has been on the moon for almost three years, monitoring the mining of Helium-3 - which has basically solved most of the energy problems back on earth. He has been alone for the entire time, except for GERTY, his loyal robot assistant. Sometimes he would get a video message from the company he works for or from his wife on earth, but that's it. He can't have live conversations with anyone on earth, since a satellite has broken. The guy is alone, and it's starting to show in him. He's counting the days of the last remaining two weeks on the job. At this point I will stop so I don't spoil anything. This is just the setting for this film.Since the movie is pretty much about a guy who is alone in the moon, the main actor would have to really deliver. And I knew it - Sam Rockwell not only delivered, but delivered in style. It would be easy to overact in such a demanding role as this one, but Rockwell handles it like the pro he is. I have been impressed with him a couple of times before, but with 'Moon' he made it to my A-list of actors whose movies I will surely see in the future. Let's not forget about GERTY the robot/AI here. He is a character as well. His calm voice (Kevin Spacey, I didn't even realize it was him before I saw the credits) will definitely make you feel something, and the character is well handled - he seems just enough human to provoke feelings but at the same time enough of a machine to make him...well, just a machine. I absolutely loved GERTY in this film. This film is paced wonderfully. Cinematography is great to watch, props look good, sound department deserves a pat on the back, the script is solid. It's all quality. I really felt 100% satisfied after seeing 'Moon'. This might be remembered as a cult classic later. It's not wholly revolutionary in the sense that it isn't too intellectual or challenging, and it does borrow some elements from other classics, but when you do it like this, I'm all in. 'Moon' is one of my all-time sci-fi favorites.",10,4,12,6 October 2010
Her," Almost got a little teary-eyed there.
","What Spike Jonze does to the concept of 'Her' is something that so many other filmmakers would do differently. This is a good thing.Nothing in 'Her' is in your face. Nothing is overstated. Zero forced exposition. Everything flows in a natural way, and even if you think you have seen this story before, you haven't. The movie treats you as a person, not as a dumb object. You believe everything, and what you aren't told, you get to chew on it yourself in your own mind without any of it getting in the way of the story.'Her' is a movie about...well, it would be easy to say relationships, but it's so much more than that. It could also be about the essence of love, connection and soul. It is an honest, heartfelt movie. I couldn't believe how much I was thinking about myself, people I have loved and...everything.For me the film was just long enough, because I enjoyed having that space for my own perceptions and feelings without missing a thing from the story. My friend on the other hand thought that it was a bit too long. Anyway, I feel the movie was paced perfectly.Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful and he is the heart of this movie. I believed every word and move he said or made. He's the everyman in this not too distant future that is entirely believable - and that got me. I believed he was a real person, not an actor pretending to be a real person.Scarlett Johansson's voice is another important character. You don't see her character, because her character is an operating system, an artificial intelligence that feels like a real sentient being. I have to say that it was an extremely smart move to make her sound natural, like a person. No forced robotic voice filters or expressions - she sounds exactly like a natural human being, which makes it easy to believe the romantic connection.I have to give props to Johansson, because she too made her character feel real. Often I see her being just a pretty face in a movie, but here - boom! The face is gone, the body is gone and all we have is the voice, Phoenix's counteracting and of course our own imagination with the (sub)conscious notion that this voice belongs to an attractive woman. If you are a man or attracted to women - wouldn't you feel something for this 'operating system' or at least your perception of it? Ask yourself this during the movie. I did.Amy Adams is the everywoman, a friend of Phoenix's character. They don't have many scenes together, but they are meaningful. She does well enough to bring that human contrast into the mix.As mentioned, 'Her' doesn't shove messages in your face. But you can't help but feel something along this little story and mirror those feelings into your own life and the world around you. It is not a chick-flick although it has an intense romantic core to it. It is not a sci-fi movie even though those kind of elements do certainly play an important part in everything. It is definitely not a comedy despite some humorous moments. It is a sincere human movie first and foremost.I will recommend 'Her' to everyone. I'm still surprised about the amount of honesty and smart choices about where the story was going. I will go shed that tear right now, it's been hanging from my eye for quite some time.",10,0,1,22 December 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," If only we had Mel Gibson in this one!
","Seems like whenever we get a Mad Max movie with the word 'road' in the title, it's going to be great and also full of impressive action. I just finished watching the blu-ray version, along with a couple cool special features.There is a kind of purity to this film. While it is a big-budget movie for large audiences, it doesn't make any compromises. It is not your typical Hollywood action movie. George Miller, in a way, took all the advantages of mainstream production capabilities but unlike so many others, he didn't fall into that stream himself. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' knows exactly what kind of a movie it is, and doesn't apologize for it one bit.'Mad Max: Fury Road' isn't deep. There is a simple story and a few somewhat emotional moments, but at its heart it's just pure chaos. Everything is crazy. Characters, vehicles, violence, stunts, camera drives, everything is absolutely crazy. It's not only chaos but controlled chaos, and it's magnificent. If this was an Indiana Jones movie, it would be a 2-hour version of the truck chase scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', pumped up with steroids and acid.This movie looks beautiful. I'm not only talking about the wonderful design of all the crazy vehicles, weapons and clothes, but also the cinematography in general. Cameras are used exceptionally well, and the scenery is gorgeous. And just when you're getting tired of the orange color palette swallowing everything, you get half an hour of deep, calm blue. After seeing so many movies that try to attack my senses with excessive jump cuts, shaking cameras or horrifying color filters, all in the name of 'visual storytelling', George Miller shows how it's really done. CGI is used just the way it should be - not to make the film, just complement it.I have one gripe. Tom Hardy's Max. I usually like him, Tom Hardy is a very good actor, but I didn't buy him as Max at all. Either because it's hard for me to imagine anyone else playing him besides Mel Gibson, or because every time he spoke it sounded and felt weirdly fake. His facial expressions and mannerisms were alright at times, and I enjoyed him to some extent, but he took me out of the movie a couple times. I do realize that Max is always less of a character than the environment, crazy baddies and action itself, but I guess I was hoping for more.While Max remains a little distant, Furiosa (Theron) and Nux (Hoult) are given more to work with. Charlize Theron is good, and she is the emotional heart of the film. She's not here to look pretty, but to play her part, and she nails it. Nicholas Hoult is clearly having a blast in his role, he is full of energy and adds that certain precious spark to the cast. I have always liked Hoult, now I like him even more.What else could I say? Crazy characters in crazy vehicles chasing each other, someone playing electric guitar that spews fire and a few grannies with shotguns and rifles. If that didn't make you want to watch it, go see a doctor.",9,1,4,15 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," I'd say they don't make them like this anymore, but they just did.
","When 'Hacksaw Ridge' was over, me and my friends left the theater impressed. We all felt that it was a product of good, old-fashioned film-making. You get that certain sense of melodrama, emotional pathos and familiarity with it - and none of it feels cynical, forced or meaningless. It's not a subtle movie, but it's a very effective one. I still have 'Arrival' to watch, but so far 'Hacksaw Ridge' is probably the best movie I've seen in 2016.This movie is very familiar in what it shows, but unique in what it's telling you with these things. First and foremost it's the story Desmond Doss, his faith, his beliefs and eventually his heroics. I don't remember seeing a protagonist this likable in quite some time. Desmond Doss is almost naive and childish in what he thinks and how he acts. He's like that symbolic, well-meaning, innocent child inside us that most of us have buried somewhere in our hearts, making room for bitterness, hate and all kinds of crap that brings us down. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) was a man of faith, and you'll be hearing about his faith a lot. Mel Gibson will not downplay it at all, quite the opposite. Downplaying it would be doing a disservice to the now deceased Doss. If you normally get annoyed by such things, don't fret. This movie isn't judging anyone or pushing religion to anyone, it's just showing you one man's faith, and how it can possibly affect people around him too.The structure of the movie is clearly divided in three parts, but you still feel like you're watching the same one story instead of three separate ones. The first part of the movie is setting up his character, and you get all the beautiful meadows, like if this was a Lassie-movie or something else totally innocent and pure. You get to see him grow up and fall in love. The middle part is about his struggles at the boot camp, and while you'd think you've seen it all in 'Full Metal Jacket', here you'll find they're pushing for a different story with it, making it all worthwhile in this scenario. The last part is full-out war. While we saw shocking battles in 'Saving Private Ryan' too, again the story of Doss (and what it means) requires the movie to shock us. And shock it does, because the violence is brutal and unforgiving. The first and last part are so different from each other, that when all the ugly violence of war kicks in, you feel like you're punched to the face. None of this is cynical, conflicting with the story or even exploitative. It works amazingly well with the story it's telling us. Mel Gibson is a great director, he hasn't lost his touch. Everything on the screen has a purpose, and while his movies aren't the most subtle think-pieces, they are extremely effective and often heartfelt. With a lesser storyteller many of the events and characters would feel like placeholders or cardboard cutouts, and while some of them might be superficially just that, all of it is elevated. Andrew Garfield in the lead role is excellent. He truly gives a heartfelt performance. So no worries, he is really good in it, as is Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn (surprise!) and just about everybody else. Even Sam Worthington is alright. Special mentions go to Teresa Palmer and Rachel Griffiths, who don't have much screen time, but their small roles are important and they do a good job. The cinematography and visual expression of 'Hacksaw Ridge' is awesome. Expert camera-work, steady understanding of how a story can be told through visuals as well, not only through words. Many shots are so impressive that they will linger with me for a while, I'm sure of it. We also get a few beautiful shots with clear symbolic meanings to them, and most of them are very, very blunt - but somehow 'Hacksaw Ridge' makes them work. They don't feel pretentious, and everything works so well together. Music is very good, often used, and extremely powerful when it needs to be (the string-heavy theme in the latter part of the movie still sticks with me). There are elements in this film that can feel tacky and corny. There are the meadows when our protagonist is a child, there is the blunt symbolism, there are monologues/dialogues that are just a little bit too poetic and heavy. All of it tends to stick out at first, but for some reason none of it brings the movie down. In fact, the movie seems better because of them. It's like they took a lot of simple and heavy-handed things we've seen and heard before in movies to the point where they're clichÃ©s, but they made them work for the story. I guess all of it just adds to the charm of old-fashioned film-making that is very noticeable in this movie. To summarize: 'Hacksaw Ridge' is great. It's old-fashioned, very sentimental and doesn't hold itself back whenever it wants to tell or show you something. All of it works in favor of the movie. Powerful story told in a powerful way. I would recommend this to anyone, especially for those who have been yearning a more personal touch to their war movies, or for people who normally don't enjoy war movies at all. And unlike many other war movies, you leave this film satisfied and inspired. It's weird but it's true. You don't feel beaten down, but instead you're feeling quite hopeful. That's how powerful it is.",9,5,11,19 November 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," Why Greengrass why? What's wrong with you?
","I just watched and reviewed 'Bourne identity' after updating my DVDs to blu-ray format, and I started watching this right after that. I'm on my second break and I'm not even halfway through with the film. Not to worry, I still remember the movie from my previous viewings.Almost everything that made 'Bourne identity' good is now...worse or just plain awful. No character-centric plot. Not enough breathers. Somewhat shallow. Terrible camera work. Cast is still good and the story itself is decent, and as a story alone this isn't that bad - but as a movie this is awful to watch. So let's get into the major letdown that is the camera work, editing and the overall visual style and quality Paul Greengrass brought into this movie.The camera is always a) shaking b) too close c) zooming in the middle of shaking and being already too close to begin with. No, this doesn't just happen when there's an action scene - which would still be annoying - but it happens all the time. Needless zooming, panning, closeups one after another, endless amount of quick cuts and all of this happens through that certain filter that makes everything look green. My eyes are strained. My eyes hurt. I don't want movies to assault my body. This isn't a 10-hour long movie. I shouldn't have to take several breaks to survive this film..Not only that, but because this movie isn't focused on Jason Bourne as much as it's focused on its CIA conspiracy plot, the viewer (me) has to concentrate more. Especially when there are no breathers like in the first one, you need to keep your focus up. That's very, VERY hard to do when the camera is raping your eyes. In a way, the movie is saying 'pay attention!' and kicking you in the face at the same time. Good job, idiots.One could argue that there is more personality, more expression and immersion in this kind of approach to shooting a movie. In this case, I call bullshit. I'm not saying you can't shoot a movie well with hand-held cameras, strange editing and weird colors. I'm only saying that Greengrass shot these movies with an overly aggressive 'style over substance' mentality, when even the substance couldn't live up to the previous movie. I'm very disappointed he was the one who directed these Bourne sequels. It's not lazy film-making, it's just plain annoying film-making. What an awful decision to shoot a movie like this. I could deal with the fact that I can't see what's happening when there's an action scene (which would still be annoying) if it didn't strain my eyes to the point where I can't concentrate on the next non-action scene (which itself is shot in a same manner). I gave this a very generous 6/10 because of the cast and overall story (Gilroy's script, as usual). Greengrass can handle drama and put the script on the screen, but he shouldn't be let near a camera. As a story, this would've deserved much more than this insufferable execution. No, it's not a particularly engaging story and probably has nothing to do with the books, but it makes a decent film in itself. In short: this movie is better than how it's made. I understand there are people who can handle Greengrass' style, and I'm glad for them. They achieved something my eyes could not physically do. I couldn't help it, it wasn't in my power. I also understand people who can't watch this and give it a 1/10. It's just pure frustration. Who wouldn't get frustrated when a movie is trying anything in its power to make you not watch it? If you compare this to Kubrick's camera-work, you will explode.",6,0,1,13 September 2013
Alien: Covenant," A lot worse than I hoped, only a little better than I feared.
","I'm going to nitpick a lot, since 'Alien' is probably my favorite movie of all time. Bear with me.'Prometheus' was tough for me. I still liked it despite its numerous flaws, because of its premise, resonating themes and technical prowess. After seeing the trailer for 'Alien Covenant', I expected to fully hate this film. In a way, it's a fitting sequel for Prometheus - both are very flawed. What I found lacking in Prometheus, I partially got from this one, but what I didn't want Prometheus to be in the first place, this was. What I didn't want Prometheus to be was a straight-up Alien movie where people I don't care about run away from (or fight) a celebrity monster. Sadly, that's the main attraction for this movie, and the least interesting thing about it. Aliens have become video game creatures. I couldn't care less about the old melon-head, not to mention its brutally slaughtered victims. Its amazing life cycle is also held hostage by plot convenience: things happen rapidly because you just have to cram it all in there, and most things just breeze by. All of it just feels like toothless, gratuitous fan-service. This is what many people wanted Prometheus to be, and now they got it. Doesn't feel like a good idea now, does it? Remember the monster in 'Alien'? They didn't show it much. It was clumsy, mysterious and horrifying...but the sequels turned these disturbing creatures into meaningless drones that run around fast, shriek all they can and swarm you. 'Aliens' was still a good action movie, but the monster itself was demystified and it became something that would eventually leave me disengaged and bothered, which happened with this movie.Covenant has another problem: shallow characters. They were shallow in all of them, but in the first movie they felt real, and in the second they were at least entertaining caricatures. But now? I just saw this film and I can't even remember most of their names. There were too many of them, and when someone died (which was gory and good in itself), I didn't care. The dialogue was mostly just movie talk without real depth (except for Fassbender's David and Walter, more about those two in a second). Most of the character development is forced and rarely leads to anything. The actors themselves were good; McBride and Waterston have screen presence, and Carmen Ejogo had good moments, but I wanted to care. I can't get invested to people who are basically plot devices, destined to be idiots controlled by the script (which was allegedly re-written many times and it shows). I like Ridley Scott, I do, but characters have always been his weakness, especially this time. Then again I must also question the script, and not just for the dialogue. One obvious plot twist in particular left a bitter taste in my mouth, because I hate waiting for the protagonists to catch up to speed with what I already know. It hindered the remainder of the movie, because it was only there to ensure a link to other installments of the franchise. There was no satisfying resolution. The writing seemed to suffer from 'connect the dots' syndrome.There are good things in this movie. Most of them revolve around Michael Fassbender. He plays his characters well, overcoming his material, making it more powerful than it would've been with a lesser actor. The mythology and themes, which I liked in Prometheus, are explored a little further here (although just a little) and Fassbender is at the core of it. I loved that stuff. It's not too vague, in fact it's very simple and effective. We get some 'mad scientist' - elements too. The themes of the creator and the created, the grotesque body horror - they all work in favor of the film. I gave the writers crap, but I must give them some credit too, because thematically the movie kind of works and has some nice individual touches.The middle hour is good entertainment, and I'd recommend Covenant for that alone. It's still clumsy, but that's where the heart of the movie is. After 30 minutes of almost nothing (not counting the sequence at the very beginning), and before the final 30 minutes of weightless action and tired tropes we actually get a decent movie in between. That's where Covenant reaches high. It can't get there, but it's so confident in itself that you almost believe it.Technically, Alien: Covenant is quite good, which was expected. At times great cinematography and camera-work (at other times just bland). The art direction/designs are haunting and the creature effects are great when they're practical. When it's CGI (which is most of the time) it's still good, but it's weightless and without impact. The sets and props are great, and the sound department handled their job well too. Nice display of production and craft. In the end, 'Alien: Covenant' is full of annoyances but also has some genuinely good touches. It's a stronger film when it's not trying to be a franchise movie, and it's a frustratingly hollow mess when it's trying to be one. Yes, the characters (except for Fassbender) are used like cheap toys and the monster is just a circus attraction that has become a parody of itself. If you forgive that, there is plenty to like somewhere in the middle of it all. It's technically impressive enough and it's got that certain foreboding atmosphere. If you enjoy pompous, larger-than-life themes or if you just enjoy mindless alien stuff, you'll get what you pay for either way - to an extent. You won't love it, I didn't either, but despite that nagging disconnect I felt throughout the film, it's still at least entertaining and sometimes rises above itself. That's why I liked this one more than I probably should. As a movie, it's a mess. As entertainment, it's alright.",6,3,11,17 May 2017
The Martian," It's alright. Nowhere close to great.
","'The Martian' is a crowd-pleaser. It's a feel-good movie. It's adequately put together, and it's aesthetically pleasing most of the time. It's not a tight, gripping story at all, it's more like a 2+ hour montage. It's perfectly fine as what it is, but it's certainly nothing more than what it is.There are plenty of transitions between Mars and Earth. Problems are presented, and one after another they are solved, often without tension or deeper investigation. Things just happen. Science - as opposed to what I heard about it before seeing this film - is treated like it often is in these films. You don't get to really dive into the world of scientific wonders. Science is just a plaything to further the story along. And that of course is fine, as long as you know what kind of movie you're going into. If you don't count the nice visuals, 'The Martian' feels like a movie that could've existed in the 1980s. It's not deep, it's not highly intelligent, but it's a nice popcorn movie instead.Characters are somewhat shallow. They all have roles in the story, and that's it. I never got to really 'know' any single character well. They do have characteristics to them, but it ends there. I hoped for something more for a movie that was nominated for an Oscar. I can't tell you how that happened, because this is not an Oscar-worthy movie. It's a pretty good one, and pretty good movies shouldn't count.Matt Damon is well-cast and entertaining in the lead role. He's not great, and I certainly didn't learn anything about his character, but he's entertaining. The whole cast works well enough, and Sean Bean is always a plus.I'm still waiting for that last great movie from Ridley Scott. Prometheus suffered from much of the same problems than this movie does. I like them both just fine, but whenever there's a chance to really dive in to the story or to the characters, to really deepen the tension, the moment is gone almost as soon as it began.But, in the end, I felt pretty good once 'The Martian' was over. Indeed, it's a feel-good movie, and does have its moments. A few laughs here and there, sometimes even unexpected ones. I wasn't bored once, and even though the science was just a quick pawn for the story, some of it was undoubtedly cool.Not a masterpiece. Not an Oscar-worthy movie. Not even close to Ridley Scott's best films. Structure and pacing is a little off. It's also not a failure, and certainly not boring. I would recommend this one for those evenings when you don't have much else to do and even if you think you don't want to pay too much attention to what's happening, because this film doesn't get stuck into the details. It's an easy watch, and these movies have their place too.",7,1,2,28 March 2016
