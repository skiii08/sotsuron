Raiders of the Lost Ark," A must see film!
","Choosing one word that best defines Steven Spielberg's The Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first film in the Indiana Jones trilogy, would be an incredibly difficult task. Exciting, entertaining, action-packed, and humorous are all good words to describe the movie; however, the best definition for the film can only be made by combining all those words into one. The film possesses all the qualities that make watching action-adventure movies so entertaining, while adding a new and humorous twist into the mix. The Raiders of the Lost Ark set new standards in the genre at the time of its release. That is to say, it has changed the silver screen forever, defining the action-comedy motion pictures of today. New movies, like The Mummy for example, have characters cast and portrayed in the same stereotypical and likeable roll because of the discovery made by Steven Spielberg. Overall, The Raiders of the Lost Ark created the groundwork for many popular movies of today that may have never existed without it. To further prove this point, the best aspects of the movie, specifically the characters and actors, the innovative story, and the blending of action-comedy must all be examined and appreciated.To begin with, the attention to the characters and casting had a great effect on boosting the movies popularity. Defining and depicting memorable characters that were humorous, strong, and easy to relate to is definitely one of the most positive aspects of the film. For instance, the archeologist and professor Indiana Jones, the hero, chooses to use a whip rather than a pistol or more deadly sidearm. This makes him appealing to the audience due to both his unique and memorable qualities as well as his nonviolent nature. Furthermore, by casting actors who are believable and realistic representations of their roles, the audience is better able to connect with the picture. While the characters were typically stereotypical and fairly impersonal, they were made this way on purpose for two reasons. First, it allowed the movie to poke fun at the way in which other action-adventure movies' characters were all so similar and predictable. Second, it allowed the viewers to enjoy this film's rapid pace without getting lost in the complexities of each character. For example, Indiana Jones begins a chase scene by jumping off his horse onto the back of a truck. By having Indiana use a horse instead of modern transportation, the audience associates him with the standard action-adventure hero of the past, giving his image greater depth without having to provide much background explanation. At the same time, these staples of the genre are marked as humorous when observed in retrospect, with the past contrasted against the present. All things considered, the characters and actors are rarely so well done in a motion picture as in The Raiders of the Lost Ark.Furthermore, the casting of this picture is also one of its strongest points. It difficult to imagine the film having even a slightly different cast since each actor and actress relayed their roles so perfectly in the movie. For instance, Harrison Ford, the ideal choice for Indiana Jones, instantly projected the image of a strong and witty character so well that it would take an entire page in a novel to accomplish the same task. His previous role as Han Solo in Star Wars made him identifiable and likeable to the audience, and the fact that his role in both movies was very similar made him an excellent choice. In addition, Karen Allen, who plays Marion Ravenwood, is able to create the perfect counterpart to Indiana Jones. When paired together, Marion's strong and feisty attitude compliments Indiana's character without detracting from his image. Finally, the villains, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) and Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) both manage to portray their evil actions convincingly. Specifically, Belloq, a French archeologist, uses hit wits to play both sides for his own benefits, and Dietrich has a flair for villainy and a nefarious image that is exactly what one would expect from a Nazi secret agent. On the whole, the actors were chosen with a great deal of forethought, and the film proves that investing time to pick proper talent to do a movie can make it great just by their presence.In addition to the characters and actors, the story of The Raiders of the Lost Ark was a perfect fit for the action-comedy genre. To be precise, Steven Spielberg was able to create a film that traveled to a variety of locales all around the world, introduced the heroes to harrowing and exciting action sequences, and created a plot that kept you on the edge of your seat. To begin with, the movie had a grand scope, constantly moving the action to new places around the globe. For example, just a few of the places visited include the mountains of Tibet, the Tunisian desert, and a German U-Boat near the French coast. By introducing the viewers to so many new settings, it is less like watching a movie and more like traveling with the heroes to follow the story. Furthermore, the story allowed for many new action sequences that have never been done before in other films. Since the hero is always in search of an artifact that must be discovered, it sets up for a great variety of dangerous situations. For instance, the scale of these sequences goes from escapes from natural dangers like giant boulders, spiders, and snakes to technological threats such as gunfights, and car chases, as well as the supernatural. The diversity and sheer quantity of the challenges, traps, and dangers that the hero faces are commendable, seeing as most films cannot manage to fit in even half as much in the time given. While the plot may be considered simple at its roots, the scale and variety of events that occur keep the audience from knowing what is going to happen next.  Consequently, The Raiders of the Lost Ark was successful in creating an imaginative and enjoyable story that was easy to follow and also an electrifying experience for the viewers.Finally, the perfect melding of action and comedy in The Raiders of the Lost Ark is its most compelling quality. A balance was struck between poking fun at other films and television shows in the action-adventure drama, while creating great effects and new experiences of its own. In turn, the movie defined the action-comedy genre by setting the standards that future movies emulate and will be judged upon. On the one hand, the audience is treated with heavy doses of satire and comedy. For instance, one scene has a monkey hail an undercover German agent, making a statement against one of the many vices the Nazis practiced in a humorous fashion. On the other hand, the escape from the giant boulder and the dangerous snake pit provide a strong sense of action and danger. While most of the sequences are taken from the clichÃ©s in action-adventure genre, they are presented using either a humored twist or with added thrills, making the experience fresh and enjoyable for any audience. Additionally, the movie featured some of the best fight sequences on the silver screen. For example, one particular sequence takes place underneath the slashing propellers of a Nazi Flying Wing. By taking the fight to such a creative and original setting, the film is able to provide a whole new level of thrills for the audience. On the whole, one of the greatest qualities of this film is that it never takes itself seriously, providing action as well as comedy into a two-hour thrill ride.
All in all, The Raiders of the Lost Ark has managed to single handedly define and lay the foundations for the action-comedy genre. Without this film, fans of both the action-adventure and comedy genres would be missing out not only on the trilogy itself, but also some of the great films that came after it. Modern day movies like The Mummy, its sequel, The Mummy Returns, and The Mask of Zorro can be entertaining, but anyone who has experienced the Indiana Jones films, especially The Raiders of the Lost Ark, will have a better appreciation of the feeling that movie-makers are trying to recreate today. Seeing this classic movie for the first time is a treat that no one should miss. Whether you are looking for action, adventure, thrills, comedy, or just good, old-fashioned nostalgia, Indiana Jones in The Raiders of the Lost Ark is your ticket.",Null,0,0,3 March 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Uneven is the best word to describe the film.
","Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't exactly what I expected and in a way it did not meet my expectations. Instead it turned out to be a diluted version of the trailers I had previously downloaded from the internet a month before the theatrical release.The first thirty minutes of the movie are quite boring and contrived, and are designed to add some semblance of plot to the film. There is some use of computer animation early on and it fails miserably, easily souring your expectations for the movie early on (fortunately this is redeemed later on however, if you have not yet chosen to leave the theatre). For example, they attempt to show you what Zion (the last sanctuary for the human species) would look like, but instead it comes of looking cheap and cartoon-like. The large turning cog wheels that controlled the main door to Zion were reminiscent of the CG work in 'The Lord of the Rings' which is definitely not a positive aspect considering this is meant to be futuristic rather than medieval.Uneven is the best word to describe the film. I would classify the various scenes into two categories. One third of the entire movie features no action, and instead contains long expositions about uninteresting, nonsensical topics. Unfortunately many childish attributes litter these scenes, such as the 'key maker' who is integral to the quest, but is actually a small Chinese man who quite literally looks like a 'Home Depot' employee who would duplicate keys for you. This third of the movie is quite a turnoff and could possibly cause an impatient person to leave the theatre during the film.However, the actions scenes, which seemingly make up the other two-thirds of the film (although in retrospect it is likely that these scenes are just more memorable and seem to last longer) are usually very good, with two that I would consider brilliant, seeing as they improved upon the first film. These scenes feature a motorcycle chase, in reverse traffic no less, and a fight vs. nearly a hundred cloned 'Smith' agents in the park. If you enjoy motorcycling or car-chases, the thrills achieved here would probably be worth the price of admission alone. However, I must note that I was watching the film on an IMAX size screen, so this may have helped in making the experience more immersive and engrossing. Overall the action-oriented portion of the film successfully offset the boring parts as discussed in the previous paragraph.I would recommend seeing this film only if you can accept its numerous faults such as the embarrassingly contrived plot and dialogue, and also give it a fair chance to redeem itself. If you do enjoy actions scenes and computer graphics, then I suggest you see this film at a matinee and preferably on a big screen.7.5/10",8,0,0,8 June 2003
