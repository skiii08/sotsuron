Blade Runner 2049," A completely worthy sequel, but let's hope the director's cut redoes the score.
","This is one of very few spoiler-free reviews I've written for IMDb. This movie deserves it. It's definitely one of the best sequels ever made, especially considering how many years have passed since the original. Aliens is still my favorite sequel of all time, but this one is a close second for entertainment value, and as a continuation/expansion of the story started by its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 is arguably equal or superior. If you're mad at Ridley Scott for what he did to the Alien universe with two rather abysmal prequels, go see Blade Runner 2049 and hopefully all will be forgiven.Blade Runner 2049 is filled with nods to the original, but they are seamlessly integrated because this really does feel like the same world 30 years later. At first, the movie seems to be presenting us with a new and different, more lonely, and more isolated future than Deckard's rainy, crowded streets of LA. But, in time, it reveals the Blade Runner world we expect, expanded in a way that does justice to 35 years of real- world cinematic advances, while introducing some new and very memorable settings.The movie has a very deliberate pace - obviously too slow for some reviewers on IMDb - but even that feels like a stylistic homage to the original (or at least an homage to complaints about the original). I detected some scenes here and there that felt a bit too dragged out, but they were few and far between, and I imagine they fit the director's vision, so hopefully there won't need to be too many different versions of this film.In a way, the story line is simpler than that of the original, but in another more practical way, it is much deeper. From the start, I was expecting a chase for newer or more (or more interesting) replicants, but all I can say is, the movie goes in a direction I wasn't expecting. If it feels at all predictable (and to me it really didn't - there were some plot twists that surprised), it is only because it fits naturally within the Blade Runner world so familiar to fans of the original film.Harrison Ford plays a very important part in this film, but it is Ryan Gosling's movie for sure, and he does a fine job with the role.I saw it in 3D and, while the movie wasn't ruined by gimmicky 'obviously just done for the 3D effect' scenes, there were times when I felt like the scenes were a bit too washed-out and bleak, and I wasn't sure whether that was the intent or just the effect of the 3D glasses. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater but haven't decided whether to go with 2D next time. The only aspect of the movie that I really disliked was the score. At times Vangelis-like (which is to say, almost angelic-sounding), it was more often than not ominously oppressive, drowning out my ability to concentrate on the on-screen action instead of creating the powerful effect Hans Zimmer usually achieves. I feel like his contribution does not elevate Blade Runner 2049 the way it did Interstellar (where it was also way too loud, but at least created powerful emotions). My dislike for the score notwithstanding, the few nods to the original score are done extremely well, with the most important one arriving not a moment too soon (and that's as close to a spoiler as I'll get).The entire movie continues and expands the discussion about the complex interactions between humans and the technology they create, while introducing some surprisingly original ideas (at least for cinema) about the interactions among various different technologies.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Is Deckard a replicant? All I can say is that Blade Runner 2049 addresses this question. Well, maybe 'acknowledges' would be a more appropriate word...",8,2,9,9 October 2017
First Man," IMDb closed its boards, but Gosling's on the moon.
","Alternate review title: It's a good thing Neil Armstrong happened to land on the moon, otherwise a biopic about him would apparently be really, really boring.Motivated by its theatrical trailer (and some of the positive reviews here on IMDb), I saw First Man the weekend it opened, and I enjoyed it overall. Until I went back and read some of the more negative reviews and realized I agreed with those too!Where to start? Well, first things first. This movie is nowhere near as entertaining or uplifting (or even informative) as either The Right Stuff or Apollo 13.On the other hand, First Man does a serviceable job of filling the gap between those two films, neither one of which addresses the zenith (so far) of the space program, which was of course the first moon landing. So, an inferior movie about a superior topic can still be emotionally powerful and thought-provoking.The moon landing sequence is very well done, as is the opening sequence featuring Neil's foray into the stratosphere. In between, there are a lot of unnecessarily shaky home-movie-style family micro-dramas of slight interest (except for one very touching story arc that links the opening and closing of the film).Apart from the segment on the Gemini program (I not only learned its purpose but also its correct pronunciation: GEM-ih-nee, not GEM-ih-nye!), First Man gives very short shrift to the space program and the other astronauts. It even goes so far as to make Buzz Aldrin seem like a jerk. At least Monty Python respected Buzz.That's why you have to keep reminding yourself - apparently this is a movie primarily about Neil Armstrong and his familial relationships (or lack thereof); it is not a movie about the moon landing.The trouble is, if Ryan Gosling's performance is accurate, then Neil is a rather introverted, stoic, and emotionally detached person.As for the in-capsule sequences, we get it Mr. Chazelle - it was claustrophic, loud, and shaky, with poor visibility. But some of the blastoff scenes felt as if we were getting a first-person view not from the mission commander through his space helmet, but from a passenger looking through the viewfinder of a first-generation Sony HandyCam. Was it really that bad? If so, then kudos for the realism, I guess...OK, what about the flag flap? You know, the manufactured outrage about the lack of a scene showing the planting of the United States flag on the moon.Although the U.S. flag was barely shown at all on the moon (i.e., the complainers are technically correct), this flap still seems like much ado about nothing, for several reasons:1. As noted, many aspects of the space program were rushed or completely ignored in this movie, so what's one more?2. There were numerous other scenes in the film clearly intended to evoke pro-U.S., patriotic feelings - many of them featuring the U.S. flag. These worked on me, and if they were added in post-production due to the controversy, then I guess it was useful after all. There is also a social commentary scene (alluded to by my review title), apparently included as a reasonable counterpoint to all the space-hype.3. It's not too surprising that a U.S. flag planting would be cut/omitted to increase the international appeal of this film. After all, the only thing more distinctly American than the right to disrespect the flag is the right to maximize one's profit.4. Last, and most importantly, the movie was about Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon and - with one major dramatic exception - not at all about what he did after he got there. That dramatic exception is a powerful scene (no spoiler) that kind of makes the whole movie, especially since the focus is on Neil's relationship with his family.Focusing on anything else that Armstrong did on the moon - even planting the flag - would have completely robbed that scene of its emotional impact. I hope this scene depicts an actual event; if added only for dramatic effect, it would ruin my impression of the film and filmmaker.All in all, First Man is a decent, if flawed, film with some unforgettable scenes that are a bit too few and far between. It doesn't really seem Oscar-worthy, except maybe for the score, which was especially powerful during the touchdown on the moon. It's definitely worth a view at the theater, but probably not worth an IMAX upcharge.",7,0,1,20 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Bore! Again!
","Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's 'failure'. All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. It is to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.",1,50,98,13 July 2008
Source Code," It's not Deja Vu all over again, because Deja Vu was a good film
","Here's a simple review of Source Code: If you didn't like Deja Vu, with Denzel Washington, you'll probably hate Source Code. In fact, if you loved Deja Vu you'll probably still hate Source Code.SC doesn't work on any level. The explanation of the sci-fi tech is lazy - it doesn't work hard enough to warrant the suspension of disbelief you'd need to invest yourself in the story.The characters are so clichéd it's too embarrassing to even talk about them. Suffice it to say that they're phonier and more unbelievable than the quantum physics technobabble.The hero finds the bomb in the first place he looks. Yawn. The bomber is the last person he suspects but the first person Hollywood would suspect. Yawn.The super-secret, billion-dollar, experimental quantum physics project at an Air Force base is run by a nebbishy civilian professor, one technician, and Vera Farmiga. Groan.Did Jake Gyllenhall change the past in his universe, the future in a parallel universe, or what? Who cares?Howard Stern Tweeted about this movie 'it was great.' He is known for questionable taste in movies, so I wasn't sure what to do with that review. I figured going in that the lack of an exclamation point was intentional sarcasm. After seeing this turkey, I sure hope it was.",1,88,176,3 April 2011
Star Trek," Finally! A remake/reboot/re-imagining/re-whatever gets it right!
","Star Trek is fantastic. It works on multiple levels. First, the characterizations are very faithful to the personality traits we've associated with Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, and the rest of the crew for the last 40 years. And yet, at the same time, the actors breathe new life and vitality into the roles. There's a fair amount of action, and lots of humor - fast-paced, clever humor, not just throwaway lines. While watching this movie, I was enjoying it so much I started to wonder - would it be as entertaining if this was the first time we met these characters, or is part of the charm seeing such a believable 'origins story'? I really couldn't decide, the movie did such a seamless job of updating - yet staying true to - the Star Trek story.OK, so yeah, the plot is a little confusing, because of the time travel aspect. But it wasn't nearly as bad as the Lost In Space remake in that regard. And yes, the 'loner out for revenge'-type villain may not provide many opportunities for grand philosophizing, but somehow the movie still seemed like it had a lot of depth. And for some reason, I actually thought this was one of Eric Bana's better roles. I knew this movie would be good when most of the bad reviews on IMDb seemed to be from Trekkers who are upset about damage to the space-time continuum, or problems with parallel universes, or the look of the control panels, or other stuff that would normally be reserved for a line of dialogue from Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons. Here's just one example of something the movie did right... I always hated that part from Star Trek II where Kirk was all smug about how he changed the Kobayashi Maru scenario so he could win. It seemed like such a stupid thing to be proud of - but I have to admit it was a quintessential Kirk (and Shatner) moment. And when this movie began to elaborate on that event with young Kirk hamming it up during the fake crisis, I thought 'Oh man, I don't like where this is going' - I began to sense shades of Superman Returns, with scene after classic scene being simultaneously rehashed and stripped of its soul. But no sooner did I have this thought then - BAM! - it turns out to be a setup for a very dramatic confrontation between Kirk and Spock that sets up their dynamic for the rest of the movie - not to mention the last 40 years. Somehow, J.J. Abrams really did achieve time travel with this movie. He propelled Star Trek into the future by fully honoring its past. Bryan Singer (Superman Returns), Tim Burton (Willy Wonka), Michael Bay (Friday the 13th), Peter Jackson (King Kong), and all those other directors who have been destroying the classics for the last decade or so should take note. Christopher Reeve IS Superman and always will be. Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka and always will be. Whoever that first guy in King Kong was always will be and Jack Black WON'T. But it really feels like we have a new Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Chekov, and Sulu. There is no question that Zachary Quinto IS the new Spock. I'm not sure if this flick will warrant as many multiple views as Iron Man (that suit and Robert Downey, Jr. are just too cool), but I have this nagging feeling that Star Trek is actually the better movie.",8,5,12,13 May 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Watch it in 2D - You'll be 33% less disappointed
","They should have called this 'Star Trek: The Wrath of Yawn'.This movie single-handedly takes the trifecta of bad filmmaking. It is simultaneously: 1) An uninspired sequel, 2) an unnecessary remake of a classic, and 3) a 3D mess. So I'm giving it a 3 out of 10.I liked the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie, even though I couldn't really follow the plot. This time, I followed the plot just fine, because I've seen it dozens of times on cable in the past 30 years.The witty repartee between crew members is well done, but everything else falls short. As with Iron Man 3, it's very obvious that most of the action scenes are intended to exploit 3D, which means that clarity and visual coherence mean nothing - all that matters is that a bunch of stuff comes flying at you.This makes it impossible to appreciate the effects or immerse yourself in the story. Most of the spaceships look uninspired on the outside and preposterously cavernous and complex on the inside.There was an audible groan when people in the audience realized this was just a rehash of Wrath of Khan.There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, so you have to dig deep to find the worst one:Forget that Kirk got his command back about five minutes after he lost it, following a scene pulled straight from Godfather III (not to mention dozens of space-based video games).Forget the preposterous chase of a Millennium Falcon rip-off through a rebuilt-Death-Star-like maze.Forget that Scotty somehow single-handedly sabotaged a double-size, weaponized Enterprise rip-off (oh yeah, it was automated for a skeleton crew, that explains it).Forget that Nimoy Spock made a pointless cameo that broke the fourth wall by practically saying 'Here's what we did in the original movie...'No, the worst part of this movie is the whole Khan backstory and motivation. In Star Trek II, it was very clear why Khan was so ticked off, and it was possible to empathize a bit with him after he and his crew were left abandoned and forgotten on Ceti Alpha V. This time around, Khan was thawed out just so they could get a super-genius's opinion on how to start a war. Say what?And Khan is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer, but he's only doing it to expose RoboCop as a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer, so he's sort of a good guy? And the whole chain of events is started by a StarFleet employee who is willing to kill himself and dozens of other people just to cure his daughter from a terminal disease. Who does that? There are no cool Khan pectorals on display here - real or otherwise. No flowing Fabio hair. No quotes from Herman Melville. Or maybe there are, I don't know. No cool hippie/groupie crew for Khan to interact with. No rich, Corinthian leather. Everything that made Khan's wrath great is absent from this film.I was really looking forward to this movie. Now I'll be completely uninterested in the next one. It's clear they're out of ideas.",3,51,81,19 May 2013
Terminator Salvation," Definitely nothing worth yelling at Shane Hurlbut over.
","Alternate titles for this review: 1) A great sequel... to some other movie franchise.2) The new terminator has a heart. The movie doesn't.3) Go in expecting to be disappointed. You'll still be disappointed.Wow, was this bad. I stopped caring about anything that happened in this movie about 1 hour and 10 minutes in. I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from 'Apocalypse Now', even in the future).I also zoned out during the drawn-out battle with the Schwarzenator near the end, because I really didn't care about John Connor (or his cute, perky wife, though she was never in danger the entire movie - another dramatic mistake).This movie fails miserably in both aspects where the new Star Trek film shines: staying true to the original while making the new characterizations and situations compelling on their own merit.Even Sarah Connor's recorded voice didn't sound right. I'm pretty sure it was neither Linda Hamilton nor Lena Headey - either one would have been better. And while this movie needed to have a big-name celebrity like Christian Bale to have a chance at success without Ah-nold in the main role, it couldn't have been any worse if Nick Stahl and Claire Danes had been brought back. In fact, Thomas Dekker would have been more interesting to watch.I cared more about the people who got snatched up by the Martians in Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' than I did about anybody in this flick. There was zero character development. The girl who's a combination of Newt from 'Aliens' and the Feral Kid from 'The Road Warrior' managed to be annoying without saying a word but, like Jaden Smith in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', you can't blame her for it, only the script non-writers.This film is practically shot in monochrome, except for the flames. We get it. To quote George Costanza: 'When you're bleak, you're bleak'.This movie reminded me of lots of other movies: 'The Road Warrior', 'Aliens', 'Transformers', and even 'Resident Evil: Extinction'. Just not 'The Terminator'.Yeah, maybe it doesn't seem fair to give Star Trek's time-travel pretzel plot a pass and nitpick 'Terminator Salvation' but I mean, there were two huge plot holes in this one that just plain insulted the whole series storyline: 1) SkyNet went through this complicated plot to lure John Connor in with its infiltrator, instead of just killing him with the infiltrator. Ditto with Kyle Reese. It made absolutely no sense, and that's even *without* any time travel. 2) For some reason, John Connor was (a) unable to trust a terminator even though he found out in part 2 that they can be trusted if programmed correctly and (b) totally stunned to find out that a terminator had flesh and blood and organs, even though that's the first type he ever encountered. What's that all about? Oh, was it supposed to be a big deal that the terminator didn't know it was a terminator? Like that's really hard to program... (and can you say 'Total Recall'?). Then there's the whole confusion/inconsistency about exactly what type of damage will or won't stop a terminator.The movie tries really hard to create a sense of urgency with the rescue of the prisoners from SkyNet headquarters. It just doesn't work.OK, so Sam Worthington's and Anton Yelchin's performances aren't as wooden (or metallic) as those of the other actors. This minor fact alone does not a summer blockbuster (or a worthy sequel) make.I kept looking for some big, intense, dramatic scene that could have possibly made Christian Bale go ballistic on the director of photography. I must have missed it, and I won't be watching this turkey again to try and find it. 'Terminator Salvation' fails miserably as a Terminator sequel. As a standalone, post-apocalyptic sci-fi vision it doesn't really fare much better.",1,225,362,25 May 2009
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," When you're bleak, you're bleak
","With apologies to the writers of one of George Costanza's more memorable tautologies, I can't think of a more apt description of 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'.The excessive gun violence in this movie - most of it without consequence - is disturbing. It makes 'Commando' look like a public service announcement from the Brady Campaign. I'm all for 2nd Amendment rights. And the right to eat whatever you want too, but if a movie showed skinny supermodels binging on Pizza Hut, KFC, and Burger King for 2 hours and never gaining a pound, I'd find it similarly unbelievable and irresponsible. The Winter Soldier himself is, without exaggeration, the least inspired villain since The Phantom Menace. And it's much less excusable in this case, because I think just about everybody expects more from the pages of Marvel lore than they do from the creative mind of George Lucas (at least since the mid-1980s). Hey Marvel, if you're going to drop only the slightest of hints at a guy's origins or motivation, you might want to try making him interesting first. Apart from a brief opening scene on a ship, and a pointless trip to a training ground in New Jersey, the movie was set entirely in and around Washington, DC. News flash: That may be one of the most boring (and phoniest) settings on the planet, even before you add CGI. The last movie that successfully pulled off an all-DC setting came out over 25 years ago (Kevin Costner's 'No Way Out').Yeah, I know that the trip to the training ground - during which a supercomputer, imbued with the personality of the nebbish from the first Cap'n America movie, attempted a murder-suicide - was supposed to provide vital plot exposition. But good ole Steve Rogers had already deduced all there was to know about the threadbare plot the minute he saw the new heli-carriers (*audible groan* 'Not heli-carriers again?')I guess I'll have to check the FAQs or the message board to figure out what's going on with Nick Fury. I must be too dense to have grasped it. Is he dead, alive, a clone, or what? I'll also have to check with the comic book fans to find out whether Falcon was as forced and unnecessary in the monthlies as he was in this movie.As for Captain America, the whole series is kind of embarrassing. I mean, Chris Evans is a handsome guy, apparently very muscular now, and likable. But he's already played the Human Torch so why does he get to come back as a different Marvel Universe character just because the Fantastic Four movies sucked? What's next, Tobey Maguire as Mysterio? Then again, Jessica Alba as Spider-Woman would be OK, so never mind.If you want to watch a good movie about heavily armed aerial urban pacification vehicles whose developers are secretly nefarious, watch 'Blue Thunder' instead. You'll save 30 minutes that you can use to go out to Quiznos. I hear they have zero-calorie sandwiches now.",5,11,20,24 September 2014
Interstellar," Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still pretty epic and powerful
","Alternate title: What?!? Sorry I can't hear what you said over the sound of Hans Zimmer's organ.An interesting movie-going experience, this was. I say, go see it in IMAX (if you feel like coughing up the extra $9-10 per ticket). There will be several points during the film where you won't be able to understand a word of the dialog being spoken due to the blaring soundtrack. In some cases, whatever happened during that scene will be explained later, in others not. But the visual impact of many of the scenes is so powerful that I'm glad I experienced them in the largest format available.You gotta give Christopher Nolan credit. The guy 'goes big or goes home' - and he doesn't often go home, certainly not this time. I was moved to tears a few times during this movie, laughed several times, was awed a lot, and thought a lot.I went into the movie having read many of the reviews on IMDb - mostly negative ones - and I actually enjoyed the movie more having had it 'spoiled'. This way I already knew I wouldn't be able to hear some of the dialog, and I was prepared for some of the sappier plot twists. It helped me appreciate the movie more because almost everything the nay-sayers didn't complain about was highly enjoyable (and some of the things they complained about didn't bother me at all).For one thing, the boxy robots definitely stole the show. Calling them boxy isn't quite fair - they get quite a lot of traction -literally - from being composed of articulated rectangular slabs. And when their dialog wasn't being drowned out it was very, very clever.Oh, and actually it wasn't really the robots that stole the show. It was McConaughey. Lincoln clearly took their cue from Reese's Pieces and E.T. (not M&M's), because having Matthew M. start hawking their luxo-boats shortly before the release of this movie was a brilliant marketing strategy. Matthew's folksy every-man is exactly what was needed in this role (Interstellar I mean, but I guess it goes for luxury SUV salesman as well), and he played it perfectly. It especially helps that he can express a range of emotion with his face since we can't hear him a lot of the time. Same with Anne Hathaway. And I always thought Michael Caine was way too famous and distinguished a face to be believable as a mere butler, but he did fine as an ethically conflicted astrophysicist.The supporting cast - Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and the actors who played Coop's children, played their roles well also.Like Titanic, this was a very fast (almost) 3 hours and that's a sign of an entertaining movie. It's weird, because there weren't even really that many big action scenes or plot transitions. I guess they were all just nicely padded with explanatory scenes that didn't feel like filler to me.Yes, there was no real 'M. Night Shyamalan twist' here because the surprise ending was blatantly telegraphed from the beginning. And yes there is lots of science and pseudo-science and head-scratching stuff that doesn't seem plausible (and probably isn't) but somehow it all just works.And yes there were things I didn't like about Interstellar, in addition to the earsplittingly ham-handed sound editing. For example, I wish they'd have tried harder to convince us that Earth was in peril (yeah, I know, who are 'they?'). The alternations between 'Dust Bowl, Kansas' and 'Field of Dreams, Iowa', both with well maintained and fully fueled pickup trucks (and no civil strife) rang kind of hollow. But then again, maybe that strange duality is not so far from the truth as the world exists today, and lots of people would love a Plan B right here, right now.The comparisons with 2001: A Space Odyssey are inevitable, and I think Interstellar holds up quite favorably in that match-up (so favorably it wins by TKO). Interstellar has every element of 2001 - the realistic space scenes, the psychedelic space scenes, the epic majestic score (it's no Also Sprach Zarathustra but not much is), artificial intelligence as a main character, and the intriguing, highly speculative commentary on the evolution of the human race. But Interstellar's 'wow factor' to 'snooze factor' ratio is much better than 2001's, and its emotional factor (on a scale of 1 to 10) is around 11 (I think only Saving Private Ryan has moved me more), whereas 2001's emotional factor is about -5.In summary, Interstellar is entertaining enough that regardless of whether you end up thinking it's been over-hyped, it's probably still worth a look-see on the big screen.",8,0,2,15 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Monsters vs. The Sons of Metallurgy
","Pacific Rim is a fun movie that's worth seeing in the theater. Its only real flaw is that it leaves you with the feeling that with just a little more effort it could have been a lot more fun.The special effects are very good, but the film spends more time focusing on the robots than the monsters - I wish the director would have adjusted that balance slightly. The battles are exciting, but it's not a good sign when the penultimate fight is way more thrilling than the final battle. The final monster battle is so muddled that it's hard to tell which monsters, if any, are taking damage, dealing damage, being defeated, etc.The character underdevelopment in this movie is so conspicuous as to appear deliberate. In fact, it's a good thing Charlie Hunnam already has several seasons of Sons of Anarchy under his belt to prove his acting chops - I doubt if his performance in Pacific Rim will have his agent's phone ringing off the hook. Idris Elba does a fine job trying to channel drill instructors R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Michael Ironside. But it's a bit of a letdown when we find out that the big, mysterious secret he's protecting is that he is a father figure to Jax Teller's cute Japanese co-pilot. Although I must admit that good dad/bad son is an interesting alternative to good cop/bad cop, that whole dynamic with the Australian Jaeger pilots was still played out in a very clichéd and unbelievable way. I would have preferred a little less focus on them and a little more dialog from the other Jaeger pilots. The most well developed characters are also the two most obnoxious: the eccentric scientists. Charlie Day is the Bobcat Goldthwaite for our time, but at least with Bobcat you knew his mannerisms were just schtick. With Charlie Day you're never sure, and that's twice as annoying. I guess the other guy is the Crispin Glover for our time - I have no idea what to think about that. In the end, a monster movie should be about monsters. There are a few well done snippets of monster fights in the daylight, but the majority of the confrontations take place at night, or during the rain, or underwater, or some combination of the three. For all the realism, it's still often hard to figure out exactly what is going on.Ironically, even with all the millions of dollars spent on incredibly convincing robot and monster effects, the connection between the Jaeger pilots and their machine looks like a cheap vacuum cleaner hose. That kept making me laugh and taking me out of the moment.Still, there are just enough plot twists thrown in to keep things interesting - from the black market in Kaiju parts to the risk/reward of 'drifting' with the Kaiju. At over two hours, this is quite a long movie, but to its credit it doesn't really drag too much. Iron Man 1, 2, and 3 all dragged out their 'time between big action sequences' as much, if not more, than Pacific Rim.I'm hoping I'll like this movie even more after a second viewing, just like I did with Hellboy II: The Golden Army. But as with H2:TGA, I can wait for it to come out on cable TV.I can't remember whether Pacific Rim set itself up for a sequel or not, but I had enough fun watching it that I'd pay to see one.",7,14,21,11 August 2013
Justice League," Abysmal - The credits feel like a list of people who owe you an apology
","OK, if you grew up watching superhero cartoons (Spider-Man, Superfriends, etc.), try this test. Name some Spider-Man villains. Then try to remember some of the villains that fought the Justice League in the Superfriends.OK, I'll start. Spider-Man villains: Rhino, Mysterio, Electro, Human Fly twins, Flying Dutchman, Lizard, Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus, Sandman, etc... Superfriends villains: um..., er..., maybe Brainiac? I honestly can't remember the plot or villain of one episode of that show even though I remember the invisible jet, Hawkman, that Native American dude who turns into a giant, etc.Why the quiz? Well, I guess to demonstrate that the Marvel/DC 'entertainment value' imbalance is not a new phenomenon. And Steppenwolf sure ain't gonna change this - he is the single least interesting antagonist ever seen on screen. Even Green Lantern had that dude with the big purple head. Think about it. Ben Affleck as Batman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Some nerdy guy, who has the 'Peter Parker- level insecurity and self-deprecating humor' thing down better than Tobey Maguire, as the Flash. Some other guy as a robot.All this potential and talent and practically all they do the entire movie is bicker with each other and fight computer-generated wasp- men - sorry, 'para-demons' - and a computer-generated charisma vacuum named Steppenwolf (not to be confused with the presumably live-action charisma vacuum named Henry Cavill). Many other low-star reviews of this movie have already listed its faults in accurate detail. It isn't substantial enough to have any deeper layers that they missed. It's just horrible. Henry Cavill circles the drain with a completely emotionless portrayal of Superman. Ben Affleck continues his turn as a Batman who is the complete antithesis of anything he's been on TV, cartoons, or movies for the last half century or more.Let's see... Aquaman doesn't really communicate with fish in this movie, he just manipulates water. Batman's suit is just awful. The only appearance of the Batmobile is at the very end when it is fighting some CGI tentacles on a CGI street in CGI Russia.The Flash's costume is cool. I knew nothing about Cyborg going into the film and he was mildly interesting so I guess technically that makes him the least disappointing. Wonder Woman is the standout here, as in BvS and her own film, but her character seems wasted in this plot. There are some decent jokes, many of them self-referential, but every other aspect of the movie is cringe-worthy.I give it two stars. One for Gal Gadot and one for Amber Heard. Subtract these two stars if you're not attracted to women. Or add them back if you like dudes - Henry Cavill and Jason Mamoa go shirtless a bit.I haven't really added anything new to the discussion with my review, just want to vent. But I will tell you this. I went to the theater in a good mood and with very low expectations, based on all the negative reviews, and saw this only because there was nothing else playing that I was remotely interested in. But with a movie this bad, no matter how low your expectations, it will still disappoint and you'll still walk out thinking 'How do so many people, ostensibly in the entertainment industry, invest so much time and money and collaborate on something for so long and produce something so completely devoid of entertainment?'. Some have said this is better than Batman vs. Superman and/or Suicide Squad. I'm not so sure. Maybe. No, I don't think so. Even a completely miscast Lex Luthor and CGI brown turd, or a writhing 6,000 year old Cara Delevingne, are more interesting than Steppenwolf.",2,6,14,2 December 2017
Man of Steel," Why so serious, Superman? It doesn't suit you.
","Man of Steel left me with such a bad feeling that I had to immediately rush home and re-watch Superman III. The campiness of Superman III was just the right antidote to the disturbingly serious and violent tone in MoS.MoS deserves a lot of credit for being much more original than most series reboots. Despite the re-use of General Zod as primary antagonist, MoS feels very different from Superman II or indeed any of the Christopher Reeve films.Lois Lane is a strong, 21st-century woman. No longer the primary target of Clark Kent's deception, she is now simultaneously the first discoverer of Clark's secret (or, at least, the nosiest), then the revealer of Superman's presence on Earth, then his spokesperson, and finally his salvation of sorts. Nice twist, but it ends up a little fatiguing by the end - Lois appears in so many scenes in so many different roles, it's kind of hard to get attached to her character. Still, Amy Adams is just so darn likable.And the in-depth exploration of Krypton's technology and societal structure was very interesting. General Zod's role as protector of Krypton added a compelling facet to his personality and motivation, but by the time he got around to mentioning it, I was already suffering from 'hyper-kinetic special effects overload' - and the movie was almost over. Showing Clark's childhood in flashbacks worked well also. Rather than being disruptive or confusing, it actually helped the pace of the movie. Or was it just a trick designed to add some emotionally appealing scenes to an otherwise soulless 'post-reveal' story arc? Henry Cavill was an excellent casting choice - as good for this era as Christopher Reeve was for his. Henry just looks the part, and he played it well.So why is this movie so disturbing? Why don't I have the slightest desire to see it twice? 1) The effects are, overall, too phony-looking. I knew it was a bad sign when, early in the film, the big oil rig disaster looked like some sort of video game cut-scene, with a helicopter leaving the platform at about 400mph. It only got worse, from the ridiculous twister that unnecessarily took Pa Kent's life to the Independence Day-like 'fill the screen with computer-generated planes flying at Mach 7' air battles. 35 years ago, Warner Brothers at least had the decency to hang Christopher Reeve off of steel cables to make me believe he could fly. I can't tell if Henry Cavill ever had to step away from the green screen. To be fair though, I don't think we ever saw Chris Reeve shirtless. Mr. Cavill, on the other hand, must have been working out next to Tom Hardy at the 'DC Universe Gym', because he is ripped. Unless that was an effect too...2) The 3D-centric nature of the effects is maddening: everything must move ridiculously fast directly away from or toward the viewer. OK, directors of Iron Man 3, Star Trek Into Darkness, and Man of Steel, we get it. You have this 'new' ticket-price-jacking technology and you and the cinema owners are determined to milk it. So now all big-budget action sequences have to be rendered unwatchable as a result? 3) The movie is almost entirely humorless. There is one good laugh near the very end and a few failed attempts in between, but there is nothing funny about it. OK, so this Superman has gravitas. Like I said, points for originality, but not a movie I'd want to watch again.4) Sure, Kevin Costner seems like he'd make a great dad, except for that time he told you that maybe you should have let all your elementary school pals drown (Uncle Ben Parker he ain't!). I know, it's just a setup for his big dramatic death scene, but that also seemed unnecessarily contrived. And I know, both events drove home how important it was for Clark's powers to remain a secret until he understood their purpose, which was key to the story arc. Still, both scenes were creepy. 5) An extended sequence near the end seemed exploitative of the 9/11 World Trade Center collapse. Before seeing MoS, I assumed that other reviewers complaining about this were being overly sensitive. But after seeing the big 'Terra Forming' scene and the number of buildings that Superman and Zod destroyed, I felt like I was watching some sort of fetish film for demolition freaks. It really was over the top. I guess a realistic depiction of building collapse will always draw parallels to the WTC, but it seemed to just keep going and going... I would have preferred them to make the military attacks on Zod and Faora more realistic instead.I went to see Man of Steel for two reasons:First, because it could not have possibly been worse than Superman Returns (it wasn't).Second, because after eventually seeing Watchmen on TV, I regretted missing it on the big screen. So I didn't want to miss the first run of another Zack Snyder comic book adaptation. I give Man of Steel credit for boldly staking out its own territory in the Superman universe, but Watchmen is the more enjoyable, thought-provoking, and 'epic' of the two films. They're both dark and violent, but Watchmen just seems to take its seriousness more seriously. Maybe this is an unfair comparison because, of the two, only Man of Steel can be critiqued against a 35-year-old classic film series that is much lighter and much more entertaining. But while watching Man of Steel I wondered whether I would have preferred it as the definitive Superman film if it had come first - and I doubted it.",1,6,13,14 July 2013
21," You'd have more fun going to Vegas... and losing everything
","'21' bets that it can build on the excitement of the book upon which it is based but busts by going over the top.Here's how bad this movie was: 'Jumper' was more entertaining. 'Nuff said. Need more explanation? OK, here goes but there are lots of spoilers ahead.The movie is based on the book 'Bringing Down The House' by Ben Mezrich. The book is a quick read with a detailed and captivating explanation about how a group of college students, led by their professor, beat the system in Blackjack using knowledge of statistics, memorization techniques, and teamwork. That is, they had a really successful system for counting cards. I found the book compelling.However, as I read it, I realized it wouldn't translate well into a movie because there just wasn't a lot of action in the traditional sense and it didn't have a 'Hollywood' ending; the card-counting team just kind of fell apart and each member went his or her own way. So I was very curious to see how the filmmakers would try to jazz up the story.Here's the irony: They embellished the story significantly and still managed to produce a tedious, predictable movie that didn't do justice to the characters, setting or tone of the book. I recommend reading the book and skipping the movie.Here are some of the differences I remember between the movie and the book. Caveat: my memory might be a bit fuzzy here - I read the book a few months ago. In the movie, there is a scene where a jealous card-counting teammate practically rats out his buddy at the Blackjack table, likening him to the Dustin Hoffman character from Rain Man. This scene is awkward and unbelievable and a far cry from anything in the book. In the book, the tension and dynamics between the teammates were much more subtle, but I guess subtle doesn't work on the big screen.Apparently, the inexplicable popularity of 'Superbad' means there now has to be an incredibly nerdy, weight-challenged, wannabe stand-up comedian in every major studio release. That's a shame. He wasn't funny in 'Superbad' and he wasn't funny in '21' (yeah, I know it's not the same actor). Nothing against the weight-challenged, just the blatantly unfunny. You know a screenplay is weak when the big confrontation between the college student with the double life and his techno-geek buddies occurs because he puts an 8K chip in their science project instead of a 16K chip. Who writes this stuff? I don't remember the 'Ben abandons his nerd buddies' subplot being in the book, but I could be wrong about that. It's pretty trite regardless. In the book, the team kind of just falls apart, primarily as a result of too many close calls with casino staff and a particular loss prevention specialist. The team also corrodes from within due to jealousy, disillusionment from a few big losses, and resentment that the organizing professor doesn't seem to be taking any of the risk while collecting his reward. Some of the money gets stolen but they're never sure who did it and so the team just kind of dissolves. They try to regroup in various configurations but it doesn't last. Financially, everybody still makes out reasonably well in the end.In the movie, Ben gets beaten up by the loss prevention consultant (played by Laurence Fishburne), gets all of his money stolen by his professor (played by Kevin Spacey), exacts revenge on the thief by improbably teaming up with LF (who has a personal vendetta against KS), then loses it all again to LF's five-finger pension plan and six-shot revolver. But don't worry, he'll probably get a scholarship to Harvard by wowing the administrator with tales of his wild experiences. I haven't seen a college administrator that wowed by irresponsible behavior since Richard Masur in 'Risky Business' (and he had a much better reason). Then again, I guess it's not much different than scoring big by writing a book about it, which actually did happen.So far, you might be thinking the movie sounds a lot more exciting than the book and I'd have to agree. But somehow it still manages to fall flat on screen. The book emphasized the team's use of disguises and alternate personalities very well. This was an element of the movie, to be sure, but it seemed very underdeveloped and I was surprised how much more entertaining it was on the printed page than the big screen. Same thing with the initiation scene, Ben's transformation into a 'player', his enjoyment of the Vegas VIP life, etc. In the book, the pursuit by the loss prevention consultant was much more dogged. It wasn't confined to just one or two casinos but went nationwide. The film really didn't capture the determination of the pursuit very well or the number of casinos the team hit.I could go on and on but, thankfully, IMDb's word limit won't let me. So I'll just mention a few bad things about the movie that have nothing to do with it being based on a book: 1) At 2 hours long, the movie seems very drawn out given its rather shallow treatment of the subject matter. 2) Kevin Spacey seems to have a trademark style. It is menacing yet monotonous - as contrasted with Jack Nicholson's style of menacing and maniacal. Jack's style usually works, sometimes in spite of itself. Kevin's style doesn't seem to be producing memorable performances lately. He's made some great movies, to be sure, but after '21' and 'Superman Returns' I'd say he's officially due for a comeback. Many movies that have strayed from their literary inspirations have been entertaining and worthy in their own right. '21' is most definitely not one of those movies.",3,19,30,29 March 2008
Knowing," How can a movie seemingly so stupid be so thought-provoking?
","On the surface, Knowing seems like a cross between many familiar movies. There are significant parallels with Signs, Next, Deep Impact, War of the Worlds, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and even Die Hard with a Vengeance.But clearly, the filmmaker was trying to convey a much deeper message than most (any?) of those other movies - or at least was trying to raise a few questions. How much control do you have over your own fate? How far would you go to resist the inevitable? How would your beliefs change when faced with your imminent demise? While the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles seems to be collapsing under the weight of trying to deal with these questions week after week, Knowing does a reasonably admirable job of holding up for 2 hours (though it does appear very shaky in a few spots).This is definitely *not* the feel-good movie of the year, unless you count the very last minute and somehow forget the preceding 119.This is a review for people who have already seen the movie. Stop now and go see it if you want to be provoked - I don't really recommend it for entertainment purposes.Knowing is the story of an agnostic astrophysicist single father, Jon Kessler, who becomes involved, along with his son, in the unraveling of a numerological prophecy that identifies major disasters - three of them upcoming.Jon starts off trying to fully understand the list, then tries to find out who is behind the list, then attempts to prevent the disasters.While watching the movie, I was a little disappointed that it seemed to focus too much on Jon's attempt to stop the disasters at the expense of providing a coherent (at least for sci-fi) explanation for everything that was happening.After a little reflection, I thought maybe that was the point - maybe the questions about how you'd react to these situations are more important than questions about how they come about. And the more I thought about this, the more I liked it. I also came up with a reasonable (to me) explanation for why things unfolded the way they did.Knowing is as close to a positive portrayal of Christian eschatology as I would ever expect to see from a major Hollywood studio. This clearly has enraged the secular anti-theists, judging from some of the 'Hated it' comments (atheism is passe - it seems these days it's insufficient to just be an unbeliever, you have to be against somebody who believes something). Their faux outrage is laughable considering that (a) the questions raised are universal, (b) the answer given in the film is still pretty watered-down and non-denominational,and (c) the opposite worldview is well represented in the other 99.9% of major motion pictures released.Before getting to my explanation of the movie, I will now just mention a few irrelevant things I didn't like about it (here be spoilers arising incidentally):Why do the angeliens (alien/angel hybrids) think that they can best relate to humans by looking Aryan/Nordic and acting like total a-holes? Why do the angeliens need to drive a Ford Granada (or whatever it was) that hasn't been seen on an American road for 20 years? And to a lesser extent the same goes for the truck that hit Diana, but in these lean economic times I don't expect Hollywood to smash a brand new big rig. Do subway trains in NYC really go that fast and have enough momentum to plow through cement/brick columns like they were sticks of butter? Even the ridiculous, bomb-powered train car in Die Hard 3 didn't go that far. With all the deep philosophical and religious overtones of the movie, was it necessary to show me (a) every optional feature of the new Ford F-150 numerous times and (b) an electronic ad for Chevrolet being wiped out in a hail of fire and brimstone? Talk about your superliminal advertising! Again, considering the subtext of the movie, some of the disaster scenes seemed oddly desensitizing to the value of human life (especially the subway scene, where people just kind of disappeared like so many bowling pins - the airliner crash was more horrific but seemed intentionally designed to evoke images of hellfire). What's with all of the pet rocks?Finally, why did the angeliens go to all that trouble with the list and everything when they could have just snatched any kids they wanted? And here is my answer, which when I realized it, made me appreciate the movie in retrospect: It was a test of faith - the angeliens wanted Jon to give up his son willingly and the only way he would do that is if they convinced him they had powers beyond his understanding. This also reconciled him to his father and (presumably) saved his eternal soul.This is not a new story, of course, but it is obviously new to many people, and offensive, and provocative. Which makes Knowing a more significant film than it would seem on the surface.",6,8,17,21 March 2009
Wanted," Oh the (in)humanity!
","The haters are right. This movie is baaaaaaad. And not in the Michael Jackson sense of Bad. Well, on second thought...I must admit, The Matrix always left me cold. As a computer programmer, I always thought it was stupid that a guy who didn't even know he was in a computer program was somehow able to outwit the beings who wrote it - inside their own program! So, it lost my interest for being way too unbelievable and way too complicated. I tried to watch it and like it, I really did. I mean, c'mon, Guido the Killer Pimp is in it.Of course, The Matrix's influence has been felt on many films since it was first released, but probably none more than Wanted. The violence in Wanted makes The Matrix look like Little House on the Prairie. And I finally found something worse than the intricate, convoluted, unbelievable plot in The Matrix: the insubstantial, one-sentence, practically missing plot in Wanted.I'm going to try to spoil Wanted for you, for a few reasons: (1) the filmmakers don't deserve your money and (2) the marketing team has already spoiled the movie for you.There is nothing substantial in this movie other than what you've seen in commercials and theatrical trailers: Fox (Angelina Jolie) scoops up Wesley (some guy with a slightly-cooler-than-Toby-Maguire-but-that's-not-saying-much vibe) in a Viper, ridiculous chase ensues. Fox's 'Vette serves as a ramp for Wesley's classic 'Stang, he does a barrel roll over an open-sunroofed limo and whacks a guy. Fox drives Soviet-era sedan into speeding Euro train, ridiculous derailment over a 2000-foot (606-meter) gorge ensues. Here's what you didn't see: Wesley gets revenge on cheating girlfriend and former best friend, trains with knives, guns and looms, takes healing baths, kills a few people who have nothing to do with anything, misses a big chance to save Fox by hitting her bullet with his bullet (not a euphemism), then kills Easy Reader. The 'big twist' is only an excuse to end this movie exactly when it should be getting started. Imagine if a James Bond movie ended after the opening sequence. Imagine if Rocky trained with giant logs, slabs of beef, and a screaming, nagging wife but never actually fought anybody. Imagine if Ripley had lifted off from the remote space terra farm without going back for Newt. That's the level of disappointment you'll feel when this movie ends.Visually, the movie is quite impressive, especially if you love to play Mortal Kombat. However, the abuses of the laws of physics in this film are even more preposterous than the 'anything goes, at least for Neo' rules in The Matrix. If there's an Oscar for 'Insulting the intelligence of the audience', Wanted is a lock. This movie manages to be as visually impressive and fast-paced as it is cold, brutal and utterly pointless. For that reason, I can't give it a 1 (or the just as ubiquitous 'I wish IMDb had a 0' rating). I also can't pronounce the director's name, but then I can't pronounce M. Night Shyamalan either. However, I do know something both of their films have in common. They're *bleep*.",3,5,14,21 July 2008
Avengers: Endgame," Don't forget to read a variety of reviews. The 6-star reviews seem the most accurate.
","That is not a self-serving review title. I rated the movie a 6 after reading a variety of reviews here on IMDb. The 1-star reviews are more poorly written than I've ever seen before, though I think that's because the Avengers have such a global fan base that more non-native English speakers are weighing in with their (well understood) disappointment, which is cool.I didn't have to read too many of the 9- or 10-star reviews beforehand because I was already committed to seeing this movie after Infinity War, and anyway I read some article on a news website about all the gushing, raving tweets from early Endgame viewers so I was actually fooled by the hype from a non-IMDb source for once. But, in retrospect, the 9's and 10's here appear to be mostly from the corporate shills and fan bois exactly as one would expect.So, I went to the middle of the pack of reviews and found a lot of really well thought out reviews in the 6- and 5-star range. Since there are already so many good reviews, I'll just pile on, buck-buck style, with some random musings...<ul><li>Was anyone else wondering why Ant-Man didn't call his daughter 'Peanut' when he saw her again? To him it was only a little over 5 hours plus a day or two, but he still understood the vast amount of time elapsed in the main timeline. Either way, you'd think he'd still be using his pet name for her.</li></ul><ul><li>OK, I have new respect for that scene in Iron Man 2 where Tony invented a new element (I think it was called 'triangulum'). You remember, when he used that giant monkey wrench to get his laser ring aligned? I always thought that was silly, but it took him an eternity compared to how quickly he solved the time travel conundrum in Endgame.</li></ul><ul><li>Oh yeah, sorry for burying the lead... Infinity War was way better and I am quite certain that many film and MCU fans will just consider it to be the end of the series. I think I might be doing that right now as I type.</li></ul><ul><li>Hahahahahaha. Sorry, I am just laughing thinking about how pointless Captain Marvel's movie was. They shoehorned it in at the end of the series, right before Endgame, and it was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the narrative.</li></ul>Solo movie or not, Captain Marvel's brief ex machina appearances at the beginning and end of Endgame could not have made any less sense or been any more of a cop-out. On the other hand, I fell for the Captain Marvel hype machine also, so I guess Disney has the last laugh (and my ticket money).<ul><li>OK, I admit, I really liked Captain America's hammer-wielding moment - it's definitely my favorite part of the movie. That was his version of Wonder Woman's 'No-Man's Land' scene. I guess it didn't hit me until reading all the reviews afterward that this cool moment came at the expense of Thor's reputation (i.e. that's why he had to be fat and mostly useless for the entire movie, just to set up that scene). I can see why Thor fans are enraged.</li></ul><ul><li>Ummmmm.... really? Send the two most human and normal Avengers out to get the most outer-spacey and scary Infinity stone? Yeah, right.</li></ul><ul><li>Since Hulk usually ruins most of the movies he's in, I'm actually glad he was a Banner hybrid for the entire movie. Really, Thanos should have dusted him and left Peter Parker, but I guess we needed somebody really lovable to be dusted in order to make us care about Endgame.</li></ul><ul><li>Dang, the Hollywood pecking order is tough! Bradley Cooper rates higher than that Peter Quill guy, even in cartoon raccoon form. I know, Taylor, I can't do that - mix actors with characters - but I can't remember Star Lord's name. Oh yeah, Chris Pratt. I only remember from tabloid articles about his love life. To be fair, I guess Rocket really is the most entertaining of the GotG so it makes sense he gets the rabbit's share of Endgame screen time.</li></ul><ul><li>Hahahahaha. Sorry, I'm just laughing again remembering how the Winter Soldier always brings his high-capacity assault rifle to all the epic battles between gods, hulks, titans, space aliens, laser plasma metal jet suits, meta-humans, etc. It seems pretty effective though. He should be the official Avenger of the NRA.</li></ul><ul><li>Was it me, or was it way too easy for Thor and Rocket to get their Infinity stone? If you're going to send the Avengers off on 3 side quests, at least try to keep them balanced! Then again, Infinity War made me want to go back and watch Ragnarok and Dr. Strange; Ragnarok and Endgame now made me need to go back and watch The Dark World, and so on, and so on...</li></ul><ul><li>Endgame proves that there is absolutely nothing - nothing - that Hawkeye can do to make him seem like a legit Avenger. I'm sorry, he just doesn't fit in with the rest of the heroes. I don't know what it is, he just doesn't.</li></ul><ul><li>If you're going to mock other time-travel movies' 'rules', you better come correct with your own. Endgame definitely does not do this. I haven't seen one movie so unfairly diss other movies since Harold &amp; Kumar went to Guantanamo and dissed Eurotrip.</li></ul><ul><li>I'm sorry. Iron Man has survived a lot of blasts before. I think he could have survived the Infinity Gauntlet snap.</li></ul><ul><li>I get that it's a big Marvel movie thing for the heroes to run around without their helmets/masks on way too often so you feel a big personal connection with them rather than thinking you're watching a cartoon (spoiler alert - these movies all seem like cartoons anyway), but this went over the top in Endgame.</li></ul>Captain Marvel out in space and ripping through Thanos' ship without her helmet? Iron Man and War Machine running around without headgear? Come on, it's just stupid and reckless - and it cost Tony Stark his life!<ul><li>Since Chris Evans upgraded from Johnny Storm to Captain America, I think it's completely fair that Anthony Mackie gets an upgrade from Falcon to New Cap. He has a nicely trimmed beard. But he damn sure better take some of that super-soldier serum to keep it real.</li></ul><ul><li>I can't remember what other movie made me cry this much. I think there was one. Interstellar? Maybe. Infinity War? No, I don't think so, I think it had only two tear-jerking scenes, Endgame had three or four, I lost track.</li></ul><ul><li>Endgame is a huge letdown compared to Infinity War. It's at least 30-45 minutes too long, has an uneven pace, way too little comic book action, and it contains lots of stuff to make certain characters' fans really mad.</li></ul>Even so, I think the best reviews are still in the 5- to 6-star range because even the disappointed fans realize what an impossible task it was to try to wrap up the story after Infinity War. The producers and directors at least gave it a shot, even if they missed the mark. Maybe not even Hawkeye himself could have hit that target.",6,0,0,4 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," James Bond is dead! Killed by shakycam!
","OK, so you've already heard the opening credits song is lame. It is, but that's the least of this flick's problems. Then again, this movie might be for you if......you didn't get enough of Vesper whatshername in Casino Royale. She's mentioned ad nauseum as Bond's motivation in QoS, which is just as well, because the villains in this movie are so uninspired they probably couldn't get a real secret agent to stay an extra five minutes at the office: 'Oh, it's Dominic Greene? I'll follow up in the morning. Evening, Moneypenny!' ...you needed to see James Bond destroy another Italian construction site....you were always upset that there were no scenes of Bernard Lee as M tweezing his nasal hairs. In this one you get to see Dame Judi Dench applying and removing face cream, so that's pretty close. It could have been worse, for a minute it looked like a setup for a nude scene.That's right, you might enjoy this movie if... ...you thought Joe Don Baker's character in The Living Daylights was too well developed and you prefer your overweight military stooges to have less depth....you are sick of the memorable, relentless villainous sidekicks with special abilities, like Odd Job, Jaws, Tee Hee, and Red Grant. In this movie, the sidekick's only powers are a bad Jim Carrey Dumb and Dumber haircut and a creepy Quentin Tarantino vibe. And unlike the creepiest James Bond villain ever - Crispin Glover's dad - the QoS sidekick doesn't add any comic relief. ...you are a big fan of the Bourne, Batman, Blair Witch school of shakycam, 1/2-second per scene editing. This movie has at least 5 'big' action sequences that are utterly inscrutable. I think one of them was a car chase, and there might have been a boat in there somewhere, I'm not sure. Maybe some really cool stunts were performed in the making of QoS, but only the crew members know for sure, because it's too hard to tell from the finished product.In fact, I'm confident you'll love this movie if......you hate high-tech gadgets on boats, cars, and planes, and would prefer Bond to defeat vast armies of better equipped foes armed only with the immutable laws of Hollywood (im)probability....you are tired of the elaborate sets used for the big finales in previous James Bond movies and wish they would just get real already and blow up a 3-story box out in the middle of nowhere with pretty much nothing at stake....you already knew that most cops are bad (Pride and Glory) and most government agents are bad (Body of Lies), but needed to be reminded that the USA is so bad it would even sell out James Bond....you have been waiting for Hollywood to give another South American country its comeuppance ever since Homer Simpson and family went to Brazil. The Bolivian air force doesn't come off too well in this one....you're a big Airwolf fan and miss all those scenes of antique airplanes chasing each other. Too bad in this one Stringfellow Hawke doesn't come swooping in and finish them both off.As a fan of Timothy Dalton (from Flash Gordon, not The Rocketeer), I am always glad to see his JB films move up a notch or two from the bottom ranks. Frankly, his .500 batting average as Bond is better than Brosnan's, and Quantum of Solace makes Licence to Kill look like Lawrence of Arabia. QoS is so bad, I'm pretty sure I could actually re-watch The World is Not Enough before I could sit through this turkey again.Totally apart from representing the artistic nadir of the series, Quantum of Solace is of major historical significance for another reason. Along with Transformers and Casino Royale, it can be placed in a time capsule so that future historians will have evidence of all of the really cool cars that American automakers failed to make available for sale in the U.S. before they went bankrupt. The new Camaro is taking longer to release than the Boeing 787, and the last two James Bond movies have featured very attractive small cars from Ford that are apparently for sale only in the Caribbean. WTF?On the other hand... OLGA KURYLENKO!!!",1,6,9,14 November 2008
District 9," It took 21 years to make a movie this much better than Alien Nation
","If you were utterly disappointed that 1988's Alien Nation turned out to be a very uninspired buddy-cop movie about aliens who get high on Liquid Tide laundry detergent, then this is the movie you've been waiting for.Actually, I've been waiting for a movie like District 9 for a long time: it's a gritty, realistic, and compelling science fiction blockbuster that addresses serious issues. It injects some much needed gravitas into the genre in the same manner The Dark Knight did for the superhero movie.Rating this thoroughly thought-provoking and entertaining movie is tough. In many ways, District 9 is a better film than other new classics like Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Star Trek. However, it does have its flaws, and I'm not sure I am compelled to see it again immediately, as I was with those others. I don't feel like I missed any part of its message or action the first time - but that is more likely because it was so well directed, photographed, and presented than because it lacks depth.I don't think District 9 deserves a perfect rating, but I can understand why anybody would put it on their list of all-time favorite films. I can't decide between 9 or 8, so I'll give it an 8 just to balance the number of 10s it has already received on IMDb.After you've seen the film, come back and compare your list of positives and negatives with mine. Don't read any farther before you see the movie - it deserves to be seen unspoiled.**** SPOILERS BELOW **** Positive: The documentary style is very well done; it does not obscure or distract from the action in any way. Even those scenes that are clearly not meant to be from a tag-along cameraman's point of view have a documentary-like quality, but it is not really fair to call it shaky-cam. Comparisons to The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield are way off base.Negative: The stereotypical badness of both major ethnicities in this movie lacks subtlety, and makes you feel like you've been clubbed over the head with the movie's moral. The blacks were brutal, heartless, and primitive, while the whites were brutal, heartless, and well-organized. Is this the reality in Johannesburg? Is it OK to present things this way because both groups got their collective asses kicked by alien technology? Positive: The alien effects are astonishing. This is a new high-water mark for the intermixing of computer animation and live action. The aliens themselves are a disgusting-looking mix of insectoid and humanoid, but at least they aren't slimy.Negative: Since the aliens are so creepy-looking, it is somewhat hard to believe that humans would interact with them so nonchalantly, and treat each one as just another warm body with a government issued ID number that needs to be managed by the welfare state.Positive: Many sci-fi movies with pretensions to epic scope start on a global scale but quickly devolve into very localized, small-scale encounters in a few claustrophobic sets. District 9 flips this formula on its head: it intentionally focuses on one small area of land in a city most Americans know little about (Johannesburg). Yet the production values, wide camera angles, and frequent city shots make it feel much more epic in scope.Negative: Even considering what I said above, the idea that the world's superpower nations would allow an entire race of aliens to be managed by the government of South Africa along with a private security corporation is preposterous (more preposterous than a spaceship full of aliens). Still, every film has to limit its scope somehow...Positive: The alien weaponry is awesome. This movie out-transforms the Transformers, and out-terminates the Terminator. 'Nuff said.Neutral: The anthropomorphification of the aliens is a bit silly and applied inconsistently. Behind closed doors they have the same familial relationships as humans, and they know exactly how they should interact with the government, yet most of them come off as tire-chewing, hive-mentality insects. To be fair, this type of dichotomy is necessary to make any sci-fi aliens interesting, so I'll call it a neutral, not a negative.Positive: Plenty of cool armored vehicles and helicopters. From MRAPs to Super Pumas to EcoStars, the fuel costs must have been a big part of the film's budget.Biggest negative: The various and sundry other hard-to-accept premises peppered throughout the film, such as 'Wikus can intuitively operate alien weaponry and vehicles just because he has the necessary claw', 'The prawns would allow themselves to be subjugated when there is so much alien weaponry still in working order lying around', 'Nobody could find the mother ship command module for 20 years even though it is buried just below one of the shacks and there was video of where it fell', and many, many more. The preponderance of absurdities - even after allowing for the 'fiction' in science fiction - is the reason I could never rate this movie a 10.Biggest positive: The transformation of Wikus from a sniveling, uncaring government bureaucrat to a self-sacrificing, heroic victim of inter-species prejudice elevates District 9 to a much, much higher level than that of ultimately meaningless films like Alien Nation and Independence Day. Sure, the moral was telegraphed without subtlety throughout a significant portion of the film. Still, the penultimate scene, which reverted back to footage of the 'weakling' Wikus fawning over a photo of his wife - forcing the audience to consider that his internal transformation was nearly as startling as his external transformation - was masterful film making and powerful, powerful stuff. To Peter Jackson, I say: This totally makes up for what you did to King Kong! And to Neill Blomkamp, I say: Bravo!",9,16,30,16 August 2009
Avengers: Infinity War," A great, epic comic book hero movie that does things few others have...
","Avengers: Infinity War left a lot of unexpected impressions on me as I watched it. It achieved some cinematic 'firsts' for this long-time movie fan. Possible spoilers ahead.I can't believe that after watching this movie, I can name all six Infinity Stones, and the order in which Thanos got them, and who he got them from (at least the ones he got in this movie). That is a crazy level of trivial detail but the movie left that much of an impression on me and the plot was so organically developed. It's like remembering every city that Indy traveled to in search of the Ark and in what order. Maybe I could do that after 35 years of viewing, but not after the first watch!I didn't have a lot of interest going into this movie because I wasn't a huge fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy (at least not Vol 1; I started out liking Vol 2 much better but it got kind of uber violent and I never finished it). I didn't really want to see the GotG interact with my favorite Marvel heroes like Captain America or Spider-Man. But the GotG's interactions with Thor, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Dr. Strange were awesome. The GotG were great in this movie. Mad respect to Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Quinn, Groot, and the rabbit.Speaking of Thor and Dr. Strange... Avengers: Infinity War made me want to go back and catch up on some of their backstories that I missed. I missed Ragnarok and The Dark World and now I need to see them. I didn't like Dr. Strange's origin movie but I didn't really pay attention to it - kind of slept through it and now I want to watch it again, given Dr. Strange's pivotal role in this film. For the 19th film in a series to somehow retroactively make earlier entries more relevant and interesting is an amazing feat!Just when I was wondering how they were going to work Black Panther into the plot - Boom! They go to Wakanda. Yes, the big battle in Wakanda was a bit reminiscent of the battle in The Phantom Menace, but it was still exciting. Normally I don't like Thor and his godlike mega weapons, but he dang sure needed that 'dwarf'-forged Stormbreaker axe this time. And still it wasn't enough.This was the quietest I've ever heard a movie theater. I went late at night on its 2nd weekend out but still there was a mix of families, couples, children, older people, etc. and everyone was quiet the entire film (except for some laughs at the clever humor). The audience was completely engrossed in the movie. The humor and wit worked well. As others have noted, it seemed much more organic and less forced than in other MCU movies, and helped balance the more serious scenes. OK, 3D is kind of unnecessary. Not enough occurs in 3D to make it worth the extra price. Also, there is a lot of quick editing in some of the fight scenes, but that's kind of typical for these films now. It's been done worse before and doesn't detract from the film too much. I didn't even recognize Steve Rogers with the beard and all-black suit. I was like 'Oh, that's not Hawkeye... Who is this guy? Did I miss an origin movie?' I liked that it took me a few minutes to figure it out. Nice homage to the 'Ming the Merciless tribute scene' from 1980's Flash Gordon at the start of A:IW. Too bad Loki got the Prince Thun treatment. Thank you, Hulk, for getting your ass whupped at the start and then refusing to show up for the rest of the movie. I'm sure it was a better movie for it since you're kind of overplayed.I wonder how many people will watch this movie and sit there and think 'Is Thanos right?' That's scary - especially 'cause I was one of them. Of course, nobody wants to be in the wiped-out half of the universe.Speaking of that, a lot of quality heroes got dusted in the end of that movie. Way more than half. That's scary, I can't wait to see how they come back. The after-credits scene is mandatory viewing, but now I gotta research to see whose logo was on Nick Fury's pager. Too bad it wasn't the Fantastic 4. They could use a serious reboot.Final thought: GIANT DINKLAGE!! 'Nuff Said!!",9,3,7,6 May 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Angsty Spider-Man is Shockingly Bad
","I ignored the reviews that criticized this movie for its similarities to Twilight. They were right and I was wrong. I ignored the reviews that complained about the lack of action and the underdevelopment of all of the major villains. They were right and I was wrong. I ignored the reviews that complained that it seems like the director was more interested in reeling you back into the theater 2 years from now than telling an interesting story this time out. They were right and I was wrong.I ignored all those reviews and went to see this anyway because I really liked The Amazing Spider-Man and thought most criticism of it was off-base. I liked its take on the origin story (subtler and less colorful than Raimi's version but somehow equally powerful), and I liked that most of the Spider-Man scenes looked like a real guy in a suit. Raimi's versions were ruined by the ultra-cartoony fakeness. I also liked Andrew Garfield's take on both Peter and Spidey much better than Tobey Maguire's. If there was a weak link in TAS-M it was the choice of villain, not to mention his casting and rendering. I'm sick of British-sounding villains already and he just wasn't lizardy-looking enough. But TAS-M2 just drags and drags. The make-up/break-up, on-again/off-again romance between Peter and Gwen, not to mention the bromance between Peter and Harry, is nothing short of tedious. The movie starts with a completely uninspiring tow-truck chase, notable only because (I think) Paul Giamatti was driving the truck. The first encounter with Electro - which happens way too far into the movie - is interesting as Spidey tries to use psychology to calm down his foe. It doesn't work of course. Then there is a completely throw-away scene where Harry helps Electro escape and an even more worthless scene where Electro blasts some office furniture but still can't manage to intimidate the blatantly treacherous corporate back-stabber at Oscorp. Then there is some big battle at a nondescript power plant where Electro buys the (wind) farm. And after that it gets even worse...The only thing TASM-2 does well is that the stunts and effects continue to be much more convincing than any in the Raimi series (even when you know they must be CGI). Spidey usually looks like a guy in a suit doing really impressive stunts. But that can't make up for what is otherwise a very disappointing sequel and a near-the-bottom-of-the-heap superhero movie. I'd rate it as one of Marvel's worst, just above the Hulks and Fantastic Fours (and actually, even the first FF is probably more enjoyable). The buildup to the Green Goblin reveal/transformation doesn't pay off at all. Some guy who looks like Leo DiCaprio with a Hitler haircut gets some Parker DNA, develops a bad case of acne, and crawls into a mech suit. I didn't have a stopwatch going but I think the Green Goblin got defeated less than 5 minutes after making his first appearance. Although Willem Dafoe was an excellent casting choice, I was always disappointed that Raimi's Green Goblin was really just an armor suit. Well, TASM-2 messed things up even worse. The Green Goblin this time was disfigured, but he just didn't look menacing or even much like a goblin. And the only thing worse than a Green Goblin that is just a mech suit is a Rhino that is just a mech suit...**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** By the time Gwen Stacy died and Peter-Man was bawling over it, I was so sick of all the emoting in the movie that I literally felt nothing. And I cried at the Saturn commercial when that guy was empowered to pull the rope and stop the assembly line just to maintain quality, so I'm easily moved (where is Saturn now, by the way?) Thanks for nothing, Marc Webb! You ruined Spider-Man in only 2 movies! It took Sam Raimi 3 tries to wear out his welcome (at least for most people - I was sick of the cartoon effects by the second time I watched the first Maguire outing). In no particular order, here are four other annoying aspects of the movie:1) The (ab)use of the classic 60's Spider-Man cartoon theme song as Peter's cell phone ringtone. It's not a clever homage, it's an irritating anachronism.2) OK, we all saw that it's a Sony picture, so the constant use of VAIO laptops doesn't seem like legitimate product placement but rather some creepy form of nepotism (and I am writing this review on a VAIO laptop!)3) What's with all the police cars? Was this NYPD product placement? There were more NYPD patrol cars crashed in this movie than in The Blues Brothers. Aren't there any other vehicles in New York? Or anything else to smash? Is this supposed to reinforce the idea that police are ineffective against super-villains? 4) The voices in Max Dillon's head probably drove me crazier than they drove him. And, yes, the reviews were also right about Jamie Foxx being unconvincing. I generally like Jamie as an actor, but this role did him no favors. Jim Carrey was better as the Riddler.That last thought led me to another while watching this movie. The Marvel universe may have the coolest superheroes, but the DC universe sure seems to have the more interesting villains... at least judging by major motion pictures. Give me Gorilla Grodd over the tepid trio in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 any day of the week.",4,3,8,15 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Better than exactly 3 of the 6 Star Wars films - I bet you can guess which ones
","No spoilers in here, the movie wasn't substantial enough. I decided to succumb to the hype and see it in the theater, mainly because the 'hated it' reviews on this site were rather unconvincing and underwhelming. After seeing the movie, I think I can understand why - it isn't really that bad, isn't really that good, and isn't really worth a lot of effort for a deep analysis. I fell asleep during some portion of the movie, not sure how long I was out and don't really care what I missed. I do know that the plot was about retrieval of an all-powerful orb. This may very well be the Star Wars for the current generation, but then again Justin Bieber may very well be the Elvis for the current generation.The spaceships were mostly goofy looking (can't quite call them unoriginal) but there was nothing as memorable as a land speeder, X-wing, or TIE fighter on display. It's getting tiring writing about how the need to exploit 3D is ruining the action scenes of major motion pictures, but it's true here too.I had trouble following all of the characters' and planets' names, but to be fair, I'm sure I couldn't have named Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2, Tattooine or Alderaan in 1977 before the 3rd viewing (or maybe it was before buying the action figures and play sets).Chris Pratt tries to channel Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Indiana Jones, with a little bit of John McClane thrown in for good measure. I guess I'll let the millenials decide if he succeeded, it didn't work for me. I like Zoe Saldana but her sickly pale-green pallor and facial markings in this movie were really disturbing and off-putting. I'm not even sure if this Freaky Five are more interesting than the Fantastic Four, and those movies were near the bottom of the barrel.The selection of 70's music was good, though it is totally out of place (imagine if Luke Skywalker went around jamming to Beach Boys tunes). I know that the movie is set in 2016, not 'a long time ago', but that still can't help its 'sci-fi classic' status.Probably the worst element of the movie was Glenn Close as Nova Prime. It just kept reminding me of another over-hyped movie with a threadbare plot: Air Force One.The things I liked the most were the costumes and makeup of some of the villains, particularly Nebula. The main villain (forget his name, but he was a cross between Darth Vader, the emperor, and the Terminator) was sufficiently badass, though by the end I was wondering why Michael Rooker's blue Mr. T wasn't the sole main character, what with his whistle-controlled space needle and all.I have no idea whether this film was faithful to the comic book - now I know how people who say stuff like 'I didn't know anything about the origin of Spider-Man before seeing this movie' feel.In the end, I guess the movie was OK but I have to say I was fooled by the hype. For a movie that many are calling the Star Wars for our time, I just kept thinking 'OK, this is obviously much more entertaining than Episodes I-III (so is a Ti-D-Bowl commercial), but it doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy'.",5,7,16,18 September 2014
The Dark Knight," Answers the question 'Why So Serious?'
","Remember how all that political talk about the Senate and the Republic in Star Wars: Episodes I, II & III really dragged down that series, and added nothing? Well, in The Dark Knight there is a similar amount of esoteric, difficult-to-follow dialogue - only in this case, it is about social responsibility, tenuous morality and the dangers of vigilantism. But this time, it is a central theme of the movie and - by design - it practically overshadows the characters themselves. Oh yeah, one other difference - this time it works. In fact, in The Dark Knight you really have to keep your thinking cap on - it will warrant a second viewing just so you can absorb all the deep ideas and difficult decisions it throws at you.The film opens with a very original bank robbery. Think how many times you've seen a bank robbery in movies. You've never seen one like this. Then we find the situation complicated by wanna-be Batmen. The action grows from there as Batman goes international. That's about all the detail I'm gonna give. There are some really amazing action sequences in this movie and more than a few surprises. I've checked the Spoiler box but don't really want to put any in the review - this is a movie that is best viewed 'fresh'. To the marketers' credit, this is one film that doesn't seem to have been ruined or spoiled by its trailers. It's true that The Dark Knight feels more like a crime epic than a superhero movie - but it's the better film for it.Heath Ledger's performance is very memorable, and certainly worthy of at least an Oscar nomination. While there may be the most minor traces of Jack Nicholson's portrayal, Heath goes in a different direction and really makes the Joker his own, and it's easy to see how the character affected his sleep patterns. Heath's Joker may be laughing, but he's definitely not joking. The movie is not perfect - it drags a bit in the second half. But at least you won't have to check your watch to know when the second half starts: the turning point of this movie elicits visceral emotion and that's a sign of great movie-making.And there are some parts that are highly implausible, even for a superhero epic, but they have more to do with the behavior of everyday citizens than with larger-than-life heroes and villains.Probably the hardest conceit to accept is the idea that Batman would prefer an ordinary citizen to do his job. It's almost as if his motto is 'With great power, comes great responsibility - for somebody else'. But again, nothing in this film is black and white - all of the heavy themes are presented from multiple perspectives and nobody, not even the filmmakers, claim to have easy answers.Oh yeah, there are certain scenes where Batman's voice is very strange, almost as if he's shouting with laryngitis. It seems apparent that he is trying to disguise his voice in front of those most likely to recognize Bruce Wayne's. Realistic? Maybe. Annoying? Definitely. Fortunately, 'rasp voice' comes and goes.When all is said and done, there are just too many original scenes, memorable characterizations, deep ideas, and big action sequences in this movie to dismiss it. Let the haters hate, let the fanboys rate it an 11, no matter. I and others in my theater found ourselves cheering spontaneously more than once without embarrassment. It is the ultimate irony that the Joker's catchphrase is 'Why So Serious?' This movie takes some big ideas very seriously, something very few mass-marketed films of any genre have done in a long time. By doing so, the filmmakers have achieved a milestone in storytelling: they made the superhero movie not just entertaining, but important.Rest in Peace, Heath Ledger. Your final work will not be soon forgotten.",8,3,7,19 July 2008
Elysium," 'Good Will Hunting' meets 'Johnny Mnemonic' meets 'Sicko'
","Alternate title... 'How I learned to Stop Worrying and Wait for Matt Damon to Send Down the Obamacare-Bots from Space'.In 'Elysium', Neill Blomkamp unleashes a bold, shocking vision of a world, 150 years in the future, where most of Los Angeles speaks Spanish, the world's snootiest people speak French, and alarm clocks jolt the working class awake with annoying, poorly synthesized voices...Actually, the most shocking thing in this movie is that the future still contains GMC pickups (presumably after 14 more government bailouts). OK, so M. Night Shyamalan's directorial gimmick was the surprise ending, featuring clues brought to you by the color red, in a movie where almost nothing else happens. Apparently Mr. Blomkamp's signature style consists of thinly veiled social commentary pummeled into your (sub)conscious mind by lots of really bad-ass explosions. But even M. Night didn't squander the goodwill generated by a strong feature film debut this quickly.But since enough has already been written - or surely will be - about Elysium's not-so-hidden agenda, I'll just focus on what a truly derivative, grade-C science fiction movie it is.But first a question. Why did the native South Africans in Johannesburg have subtitles for their English in 'District 9' but Sharlto Copley didn't have subtitles for his English in 'Elysium'?!? The guy was totally indecipherable. Don't make me say the R-word! OK, I'll say it: Ripoff! Yeah, that's right, Bane was first to make it cool to be a mushmouthed uber-villain, and he did it better. At least I could tell that Bane had something interesting to say, even if I still don't know to this day what it was. Here are some random musings about 'Elysium': <ul><li>I enjoyed the melodramatic overacting by the hacker king, though he could have used subtitles also. It was fun to see him determine that Matt Damon's head contained the secrets to rigging the presidency, not to mention unleashing universal health care, just by looking at a hexadecimal code dump for all of 5 seconds. I totally didn't expect that. </li></ul><ul><li>I felt bad for Matt Damon's character (I forgot his name already, as I will the rest of the movie in a few more hours) when he got exposed to an accidental overdose of gamma radiation. But at least he didn't walk around pantsless the rest of the movie like Dr. Manhattan in 'Watchmen' (just shirtless). </li></ul><ul><li>Did they ever explain why the robots were exposed to lethal doses of radiation during manufacturing? It certainly didn't make them any better as marksmen. They couldn't even keep William Fichtner's sweet Bugatti from getting jacked.</li></ul><ul><li>I laughed at the scene where Matt got turned into a cyborg. It was straight out of MTV's new reality show, 'Pimp My Exoskeleton'. With street-smart docs like that, who needs the magic MRIs on Elysium? </li></ul><ul><li>Oh, I remember Matt's character's name now: it's Max. They only screamed it about two hundred times in one hour and forty minutes. Sorry, that's a gross exaggeration, just like everything else in this movie. </li></ul><ul><li>Why would the ultra-elite of the future want to confine themselves to an orbiting space station that has less square footage than Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, Steve Jobs' iYacht, and Mitt Romney's car-rooftop dog carrier combined? Don't they know that one out of every three 'undocumented' shuttles gets past Elysium's land-based defense grid, which consists primarily of a mentally unstable epic beard man with a van full of space-Stingers? Then again, that success rate does make Elysium more secure than the U.S. border. </li></ul><ul><li>Yes, the robot and rocket-ship effects look very realistic, but the flying vehicles are kind of boring to look at, like the shuttles in 'Star Trek'. If the director wanted to do futuristic military aircraft right, he should have gone back 27 years and looked at the drop ship in Jim Cameron's 'Aliens'. That thing really looked like a futuristic Apache/Harrier hybrid, not just some boxcar with thrusters bolted on the corners.</li></ul><ul><li>Wait, so one minute you can have your head totally reconstructed, beard and all, after taking a grenade to the face, but the next minute you can't be cured from having your brainwaves downloaded to a USB thumb drive? I guess the data in Matt Damon's head was considered a pre-existing condition. </li></ul>In the end, I think Elysium fails just because it is so clichéd, unoriginal, and inconsistent with its own vision, not because of its blatant socio-political message. It's also a huge letdown after 'District 9'. By the way, I have nothing against speaking Spanish - lots of my favorite people do it, and most of them speak my language better than I speak theirs (Shakira, por ejemplo). I wish I had more time to study Spanish but I'm too busy writing this review. In fact, the only level on which Elysium succeeds is as a nice introduction to the Spanish language, which is why I'm giving it two extra stars. At around $10 a ticket, it's a lot cheaper than Rosetta Stone.",5,2,6,11 August 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Exceeds the limits of human imagination...
","...in a very bad way. It would have been nice to see a movie about robots that transform into vehicles, and how they interact with the inhabitants of planet Earth. Instead, 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is about how much contempt a major motion picture studio can have for the audience and still set box office records.Remember all those IBM commercials from several years back that showed what computers would do for us in the future? You know, like being able to make stock trades from the heads-up display in your sunglasses while disturbing pigeons in an Italian square, or stuffing meat in your pants at the grocery store and having it automatically scanned by RFID on your way out? Well, what they didn't tell you was that massive amounts of computing power would one day be used to put every conceivable shape, color, and texture on the big screen in rapid motion all at once in a mind-numbing display of sensory overload.Like the first Transformers movie, the robots do very little as vehicles except drive from place to place, so there are many wasted opportunities for creative destruction or battles. And the robots' exteriors are so insanely complicated that they barely seem humanoid - it is next to impossible to discern a face, let alone the facial expressions necessary to inspire any sort of empathy.A child playing with a couple of Transformers from Hasbro would likely be more creative than the director of this movie, because a child would explore the possibilities within the limitations of the toys' capabilities. Apparently, with Michael Bay's practically unlimited budget, there is no boundary reference within which he can gauge the entertainment value of any conceivable scene, no matter how insipid. I'm not sure which is worse: the ethnic caricatures so ham-handedly embedded in so many of the robots or the creepy overuse of the 'robotic tentacles can come from anywhere, go anywhere, and do anything' conceit.Oh yeah, I know what's worse: the 'introduce a new character to take the rapid-fire Gilmore Girls-style dialogue up another notch on the annoying meter' trick. Early in the movie, it was frustratingly difficult to understand much of what was being said, as it was constantly being covered up by robotic footsteps or hydraulic sounds. Then I realized that was a good thing.I propose a new category of cinematic recognition called 'The Academy Dewards', in which past accolades are systematically and publicly rescinded from anyone associated in a material way with films as bad as 'Transformers 2'. For example, anywhere Steven Spielberg is making an appearance to be commended or honored for directing 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan', someone should run out to the podium, forcibly remove the award from his hands, and remind everyone that he is the 'S' in Dreamworks SKG, which released 'T:RotF'.I've been wrong before (many times in fact), but I think that this movie is so bad it will generate enough ill will to sidetrack the careers of everyone in it (except for John Turturro - his role as Phantom in 'You Don't Mess with the Zohan' makes him an untouchable Hollywood legend). I already removed Shia LaBeouf from my 'show this guy some respect by learning how to pronounce his name' list.The irony is that, for all the apparent effort that went into this film, there is a startling lack of imagination in all of the action sequences. It would have been much more impressive if Michael Bay had conformed the robots' general behavior, size, and shape to to the attributes of their vehicle alter egos, and had them interact with each other and humans as vehicles more. Instead, he threw in everything and the kitchen sink, in both the effects and the dialogue, and the result is a huge mess.Finally, I know this movie doesn't really take itself seriously, even though it clearly took a lot of money and computing power to produce. But still, there is a limit to the strain on credulity: asking me to believe that it is difficult to say 'I love you' to Megan Fox is just too much.I hope I won't have to revise this statement for a while, and it is the first time I've made it in many reviews: 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is the worst film I've ever seen.P.S. Did I mention there's an SR-71 Blackbird that talks and acts like a Pirate of the Caribbean?",1,11,24,5 July 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Matthew Modine's Greatest Role since 'Vision Quest'
","Just kidding. But seriously, TDKR is a bit of a mess. So, like the movie, this review will just be a hodgepodge of non-sequiturs.Spoilers ahead, possibly for the whole trilogy, but you know you've already seen it.<ul><li>I wish the role of 'picture of Rachel Dawes' had been played by a picture of Katie Holmes rather than a picture of Maggie Gyllenhall.</li></ul><ul><li>Was Bane supposed to be a sympathetic character at the end because he turned out to be a mass murderer who once was kind to the young daughter of a mass murderer who herself grew up to be a wanna-be mass murderer? </li></ul><ul><li>On the other hand, thank you, Bane, for outing Harvey Dent as a two-face. His legacy was way overrated. Still, I'm not quite sure why every criminal locked up in Gotham should be released from jail just because Dent crossed over to the dark side for all of two days. </li></ul><ul><li>What should have been the coolest scene in the movie - the collapse of Heinz Field - was totally boring because everyone had already seen it dozens of times in the trailer. I guess they had to cut that scene short because Hines Ward is known to smile after every play, no matter how brutal, and that wouldn't have been appropriate here.</li></ul><ul><li>I thought the big surprise ending was gonna be that Batman died. Once he inexplicably survived that shanking from Marion Cotillard, I knew a little thing like a nuclear bomb wouldn't stop him.</li></ul><ul><li>OK, so the Tumblers are cool but those new guns on them looked like they were made by Hasbro. The Bat(wing) took a direct hit from them at point-blank range and didn't miss a beat. </li></ul><ul><li>Any particular reason that police officials wouldn't believe Commissioner Gordon's reports of terrorists in the sewers? I'd believe any random stranger who reported that.</li></ul><ul><li>Bane, you are one ominous dude. I like your style and your long hours at the gym have really paid off. But you're a bit of a mushmouth.</li></ul><ul><li>If I ever get sent to prison I wanna go to that hellhole. Unlimited free escape attempts with your fellow cons holding the rope and rooting you on. Plus free chiropractic.</li></ul><ul><li>OK, so Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and especially George Clooney may all be totally unbelievable as Batman, but I realized watching this movie that Christian Bale is simply unlikeable as Batman. And that's worse.</li></ul><ul><li>Why are regular citizens and city officials in Nolan's Batman movies always more cartoonish and unbelievable than the superheroes and supervillains?</li></ul><ul><li>Cillian Murphy had a pointless, disappointing cameo in this movie. Just like in 'Batman Begins'. </li></ul><ul><li>The extended boxing matches in TDKR were more interesting than the choppily edited fight scenes in 'Batman Begins'. But just barely. </li></ul><ul><li>Pretty much every bad thing that happened to Bruce Wayne and Gotham City in this movie is Catwoman's fault. But she looks fly in her outfit so all is forgiven. </li></ul><ul><li>Who would have thought that all these years later, 'Memento' would still be Christopher Nolan's least ridiculous film?</li></ul>",7,4,13,1 August 2012
Godzilla," Godzilla falls flat on his face, even in 3D
","Where do I begin? Nothing in this movie works. The 3D effects are the worst I've ever seen. In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen. It's almost as if the director pre-rendered the movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000... There are lots of other monster scenes where some minor object (broken window pane, windshield wiper, train passenger, etc.) gets in the way in a botched attempt to create depth. It never works - the monsters always seem fake and flat.Nothing about the plot makes any sense. We're to believe the monsters could completely obliterate a nuclear power plant without being noticed. Then, when they re-appear after 15 years (couldn't they have waited a few more years like the cicadas?), they can effortlessly elude radar tracking, satellite imagery, and a hundred million iPhones and just sneak around, silently munching on nuclear submarines. We're also to believe that nobody is really sure whether Godzilla is friend or foe, so the U.S. Navy will arbitrarily alternate between sailing right next to him and shooting at him with rockets. With all of the nuclear power plants in the country, which are like catnip to these suckers, somehow a major plot element involves luring the monsters away from population centers with a single nuclear weapon on a train.The score is so loud, intrusive, and overly dramatic it's mind-numbing.The M.U.T.O.s (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are as generic and uninspired as you could possibly imagine. Just think of every mantis-shaped bug you've ever seen in any movie, and that's them. Throughout the entire movie I was distracted trying to remember where I'd seen them before - and I just remembered, they're a rip-off from Starship Troopers.Every time a monster fight scene starts, it ends abruptly before anything interesting happens. In this movie, Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco supposedly get destroyed, but you can't really tell and won't really care. I think maybe 60 seconds was spent on the destruction of Honolulu and about 30 seconds on Las Vegas.The guy from Kick-Ass (I can't be bothered to look up his name) plays a giant walking cliché. So do half of the Olsen Twins (edit - it wasn't until I lost a bet over the cast of Avengers: Infinity War that I learned that Elizabeth Olsen is a sister of the Full House Twins, not one of them. Sorry Elizabeth. This movie still sucks). So do two - count 'em two - precocious endangered kids.The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of the dumbest I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure that bridge wasn't designed to hold a bunch of M1 tanks and - even if it was - they probably wouldn't be in a traffic jam with busloads of kids. I still can't figure out whether the bus driver was supposed to be a hero or a maniac for trying to mow down every pedestrian/soldier/policeman on the bridge just to save the walking cliché's son. And all those ships in the bay! Toy ships dropped in a bathtub would have a more organized formation.It doesn't really matter that Godzilla isn't in the movie that much. You'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter that Bryan Cranston dies early on in the movie - you'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter whether Admiral David Strathairn gets his SitReps from the TV news instead of looking out his window at the 600-foot-tall monster. You'll just want the movie to be over.It doesn't even matter that military people repeatedly 'pronounce out' A.S.A.P. even though in real life they'd probably just say 'AY-sap'. You'll just want the movie to be over A.S.A.F.P.I think what bothers me the most is the overuse of helicopters. I mean, I love helicopters. Blue Thunder is one of my favorite movies and Airwolf was my favorite TV show. I don't watch Westerns because there aren't enough helicopters in them. But the excessive use of helicopters in this movie made even me want to scream 'Enough with the helicopters, we get it, you can make them look 3D! Too bad you couldn't do that with the giant monsters!'Honestly, this latest installment of Godzilla is just as unwatchable as the Emmerich brothers' fiasco, and even Godzilla 1985 was more interesting.To those positive reviewers who claim that it's not fair to compare this to Pacific Rim because they're different kinds of movies, I say: You are correct. Pacific Rim is an enjoyable, well done monster movie with good effects, and Godzilla is the exact opposite.",1,302,531,19 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Thunderdome Shmunderdome - This is landmark movie-making
","Wow! Mad Max: Fury Road lived up to the expectations set by its trailer. And I know I need to see it again. In fact, this movie was so intense that there were scenes I actually needed to see again while they were still ongoing. But here's the weird part: As epic and spectacular as Fury Road is, I still think the first two are better films (and Fury Road certainly makes up for the letdown that was Beyond Thunderdome, even though it was a long time coming). Maybe it will become clearer why I think that by the end of the review. Maybe not. I'm just gonna throw out some thoughts about the movie. After watching this I don't have the energy for an in-depth analysis.See it in 3D in the largest, loudest format you can.I like that there is a bit more backstory and humanizing dialog among what would otherwise appear to be minor villains. Even just basic chit-chat like 'Hey, where are we going?' is refreshing compared to Wez's screaming.There are a few surprisingly emotional scenes that add a level of complexity to Immortan Joe that is unusual for any Mad Max villain, but these were the exception, and overall he felt somewhat underdeveloped as a character.I didn't expect it, but the weak link here is Tom Hardy. Early on, it seemed that he was trying very hard - and succeeding - to channel the desperation, mistrust, and ultimate survival skills of the Max Rockatansky we first met 36 years ago. But then it sort of falls apart and he settles for a weird hybrid British/Australian/American accent and an overall bland performance. This Max is no Bane. He's barely even the Scarecrow.So, in the end, I blame Mel Gibson that this movie wasn't quite as good as it could have been. If not for the various misbehaviors that put him out of public favor, this could have been a great opportunity for him to reprise the role of Max. On the other hand, Fury Road is not so much about Max as it is about the story (which is super-basic, I can see why some people complain about lack of plot). The action is practically non-stop. What seems like a bit of a lull in the middle is probably no more than 5 minutes long.The score is big and bold, and fits the action in most cases, though it is a bit too orchestral and less frantic or desperate than the themes in Mad Max or Mad Max 2. *Edit* After multiple viewings, I retract the previous statement. The score, particularly during the motorcycle attack, is perfectly majestic and heroic and urgent and stirs exactly the right emotions.In fact, that's another minor complaint. This movie is hyper-polished: Every scene is visually perfect. Every background sound is orchestrated. Not a piece of rust or a jagged spike is out of place. It's a dystopian utopia. Oh yeah, I kind of wished they'd been consistent and used another Mack Truck for the war rig, but oh well, I guess the OshKosh or whatever military truck they used was heavier duty. And I have to say - the vehicles in this movie were insane - crazier than any Hot Wheels car I've ever seen. Sure, there's a fair amount of 'Men are bad' in this movie, but let's be real: most of the men in this movie are bad and men in real life are pretty bad a lot of the time too. I think real men ought to be able to handle this plot element without throwing a conniption. Besides, if George Miller was serious about the feminism angle he wouldn't have had one of the Vuvalini riding a Gold Wing in the post-apocalypse. There are lots of really cool touches in the movie in the action sequences. Just to mention a few without spoiling them too much: The cowcatcher on the war rig is quite functional, and never siphon dragster fuel by mouth...The ending works well. Sure, it's kind of a happy ending, but with only one really happy ending out of four movies, you can't complain that George Miller is trying to blow sunshine up your a**.I'm sure I need to see this movie again, probably multiple times, just to absorb more of the stunt sequences. But I'm not necessarily sure I want to see it again as much as I did Mad Max or Mad Max 2. So in the end, Fury Road, with all its greatness, has made me appreciate even more the characterizations, tone, and gritty vision in the first 2 films. Still, Mad Max: Fury Road is definitely a landmark in sequels/reboots/re-imaginings, and it puts George Miller in a rare league that not even George Lucas and Spielberg could enter with their weak reduxes of Star Wars and Indiana Jones.Here's my precise ratings of the series:Mad Max: 8.625/10; Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior): 9/10; Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome: 6.8/10; Mad Max: Fury Road 8.5/10",8,6,11,17 May 2015
