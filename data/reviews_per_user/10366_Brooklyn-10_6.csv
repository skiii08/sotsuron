Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing
","Disappointing is the only word to describe the most over-hyped movie in the galaxy. I waited until mid-summer to see the movie, not wanting to be trampled by all the geeked-out mega-fans. This is an example of special effects run amok, with so many monsters and beings filling the screen you soon give up trying to look at them all, the novelty completely gone within 10 minutes. Bad casting and poor acting are my major gripes with the film, however, with not one role being played by an appropriate actor. Natalie Portman was positively wooden, as if the experience of being in 'Episode I' had frightened her into utter stiffness. Darth Maul, the only character with some intrigue, is barely in the movie. The one sequence that woke me up was the pod-race, which reminded me of George Lucas' love for hot rods and drag racing, and made me wish he would go back to making movies like 'American Graffiti', with wonderful, real people, cool cars, and not a monster in sight. And I won't even get into Jar Jar Binks...",Null,0,1,7 November 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Good fun
","Sorry to see this movie is being picked on so much already. Maybe some people forget you go see Tim Burton's movies to have FUN, already! This is a beautifully stylish movie, I could not get enough of seeing that hellish figure flying on the back of his demon-horse, cloak flying and sword flailing. Fantastic! The town itself was a wonderful presence, with old covered bridges and wicked looking trees. Johnny Depp was of course fabulous, he looked as if he genuinely enjoyed himself while making this movie. A shame for an actor of such range to be so underappreciated. He seems to suffer from the 'Ralph Fiennes Syndrome', where actors with tremendous talent are snubbed because they are simply too good looking. (They got the face, so they must not need the award, or some odd reasoning. Perhaps it's envy...?) 'Sleepy Hollow' is not scary, but then very few horror films truly are. It is more like a horror-themed ride at an amusement park, a very expensive amusement park. There are some laughs, not big ones but chuckles, and a sense of good-humor throughout. If I had to choose a weak point it would be Christina Ricci, which pains me because I loved her in the 'Addams Family' movies, but here she sleepwalks through her role, many of her lines of dialogue sounding much flat, as if she were reciting them for a boring grade-school report. But it did not matter enough to me to affect my overall opinion of 'Sleepy Hollow', which is that it was good fun. And Christopher Walken as the Hessian- of course!",8,0,0,24 November 1999
Empire of the Sun," MAGNIFICENT
","This is one of the most overlooked screen gems in cinematic history. By all rights, 'Empire' should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but inexplicably it was criticized for not being usual Spielberg fantasy fare. I believe that it is this movie, not 'Schindler's List' that is Spielberg's masterpiece to date. He paints a moving, poignant epic upon a canvas of stunningly beautiful cinematography. Christian Bale pours his heart and soul into a performance that could well be the best ever given by a child actor. As young Jim, separated from his parents, he shows us the gritty, crafty resilience that children can have in dire circumstances. His fear and determination touch us and we admire him, wondering if we, as adults, could cope or adapt as well in the same situation.Too numerous to mention are the scenes which are heart-rending or simply surreal. For me, the essence of this movie is captured in the scene in which Jim scurries to the roof to watch his heroes fly by, and cries in exultation, 'CADILLAC OF THE SKY!...'",10,1,4,23 September 2000
Fargo," Good movie, not brainwashed
","Someone made the comment that this movie must have been hyped to death for it to be rated so highly, that people must have been brainwashed. I have to relate my own experience. I saw this movie in March of 1996, when it was only in limited release, and there certainly had not yet been any hype, because so few people had seen it. I had gotten a gut feeling from seeing the previews that it was going to be good, mostly from the people involved and the fact that so little was given away in the trailers, which is so rare these days. I drove 50 miles to see this movie on one of the few screens showing it in the country. The theater was full, and it was obvious the vast majority was enjoying it immensely, as did I. So, sorry, the 'Brainwashed' theory just doesn't apply here. That only works with movies like 'Star Wars: Episode I'. 'Fargo' was as far from the world of hype as Minnesota is from Naboo. 'Fargo'- 10 out of 10, and that's MY opinion.",10,0,1,7 November 1999
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Best
","Tarantino's best and most inspired work. I was unprepared for the pure impact of this movie, although the opening diner-table dialogue between all members of the cast marked it immediately as a Tarantino film. No one shows us that 'crooks are people too' the way he does, yet he will follow with scenes of such crushing brutality that we once again remember the differences between the good guys and the bad guys. His colorful characters- Mr. White (with the 'cool-sounding name), Mr. Orange, psychotic Mr. Blonde, and feisty Mr. Pink interact with a variety of personality clashes that produce some outstanding scenes. No one character is the star, they all play tug-o-war for our attention. A lack of musical score lends a gritty, realistic, 'Cops'-like feel to the interspersed action sequences- quite unusual, and a welcome change from the orchestral bombardment present in other movies during shootouts, car chases, etc. The crime that is the center of the plot is never shown, therefore the viewer uses his or her imagination and stories from each individual character as they tell it to piece together what took place in the jewelry store. Quite a lot of blood flows in the course of the movie, but it is never gratuitous nor glorified. Oscar-worthy performances abound, most especially from greviously wounded Tim Roth and nervously intense Steve Buscemi. Some wonderful twists and a stunning ending make this movie what is sure to be known as one of the classics of the 1990's.",10,0,1,4 October 1999
The Matrix," Eye-Candy
","Having rented 'The Matrix' in a pay-per-view channel last night,  my first thought afterwards was why didn't I go see this in the theater. The visual effects and photography were pretty stunning on my 27-inch TV, they must have been stunning on the big screen. The best performance in the film was by far Lawrence Fishburne as Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' guide and mentor. If only I'd had teachers like this Morpheus in high school! The thought of reality being broken down into only a series of electrical impulses to our brains was actually a bit frightening. Almost makes you wonder if anything really is out there, outside our selves. Keanu Reeves was, as per usual, a sort of empty vessel in this movie, I could not help wondering how this movie could have been better with a different actor in the role. Yeah, I had a little bit of a hard time with the notion of Keanu Reeves as a 'chosen one' of any kind. But on the whole I found this movie rather captivating, much more thought-provoking that I had anticipated. I especially liked the idea that deja vu is really a glitch in the Matrix. Hmmm... Overall I would describe 'The Matrix' as a cross between 'The Terminator' and 'Strange Days', with more eye-popping visuals. I would be very suprised if this movie did not win the Academy Award for Visual Effects in 2000.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
