The Avengers," Overrated with some enjoyable moments
","Movies first two thirds were pretty cool, the last third was just trash.Like when the giant spaceship monster equipped with shark like teeth enters the city and starts to destroy NY with all its minions. Why do all evil things in movies have to have teeth and fangs? Why does the ship here have to have that also and make dinosaur noises? I mean does it eat other ships and chew on them? Reminds me of the movie Green Lantern when the all powerful yellow energy monster travels through space yet has to have a mouth with sharp teeth and fangs ( and make loud scary noises!).This movie is decent but gets way over hyped for some reason. I think its because all the fanboys just love seeing all the hero's together at the same time.. 5 out of 10",5,4,9,13 November 2014
