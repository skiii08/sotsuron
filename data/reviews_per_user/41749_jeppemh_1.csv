Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Stunning effects and the SOUND, man this stuff is the best
","I saw this movie in the theaters 2 times, just to hear the sound one more time. The sound in this movie is truly amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, be sure to watch it in a THX environment, you won't be disappointed. The picture quality is also very good, not a finger to put on anything. I would have given the movie 10 out of 10 but there was a few minor things that bothered me. The movie gets a bit too emotional (comparing with the first 3 episodes), not that emotional is bad, but it seems sort of fake to me. Though the thing that bothered me the most, was this creature called Jar Jar Binks. He should have been a comic sidekick, but it is as if he just becomes more and more annoying, the more you watch him instead of him being funny. One of the movie is in my opinion the lightsword battle between good and evil. You can really sense the difference between the two sides in the actors.If ya' haven't seen it, you're really missing out!",9,18,27,4 April 2001
