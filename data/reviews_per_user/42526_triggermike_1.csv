Mission: Impossible III," The Mission gets emotional
","Director Abrams really put something new to the sequel, while saving the world, Tom Cruise has to save his wife, too. And all the characters get emotional.Nevertheless there is ass kicking action in it, like the rocket attack on the bridge, which bombs you into the seat! You get to see how these masks and the voice chips are made which are often used in the movies and there is a Maggie Q, however without a Martial Arts fighting scene. But she looks absolutely beautiful! Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great villain and gives Tom Cruise a really hard time. An intense tension flows through the movie, but how Ving Rhames says in a scene where Cruise Jumps from a big building, throws himself with a parachute into a window and is redirected by the wind, just to land softly on the ground:'please make it, please ..... YES, he did it!'(paused) ......... 'I knew he would make it!'. So after all we are on high tension with the story even if we know that he makes it anyway.A really good movie, with a great cast.",9,7,16,30 April 2006
