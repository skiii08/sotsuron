Requiem for a Dream," Decent but should not be in the top 100.
","One of the only reasons i rented this movie was because i saw it at #36 in the top 250 movies as voted by users. It was ranked ahead of movie classics such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Wizard of Oz'. So my expectations were pretty high. Thus, I was really disappointed when i finally saw this movie. It was well acted and gave a realistic portrayal of addiction, but it was just too one dimensional. The characters had no depth and it was really hard to give a damn about them. The only things you saw was their addictions. It was just downright depressing even with the normally funny Marlon Wayans.There was really nothing that set this movie apart from other movies depicting drug abuse. I've seen 'Drugstore Cowboy' and 'Basketball Diaries' and they were far more entertaining.  So don't let the high user rating fool you. It must have been rigged or something. This movie doesn't belong anywhere near the top 250. I would give it a 5/10 rating.",3,5,11,14 June 2002
Disturbia," Decent but very predictable
","When I saw the positive reviews for this movie, I thought this would be a very fresh and suspenseful thriller. However, I was disappointed to realize that it was very unoriginal and predictable. It was still watchable and had some good points but I can't really give it more than an average rating.First of all, there wasn't really anything original about the plot. I've seen it on countless movies, sitcoms and drama series. It goes like this. New neighbor moves in. Main character decides to spy on the new neighbor and sees something suspicious. Main character continues to spy and sees a pattern of behavior that makes the neighbor look like a murderer. Main character becomes obsessed with finding out the truth about the neighbor. The only thing that was really different here was that the boy in this case was on house arrest and he had several high tech gadgets at hand that he could use to spy.Secondly, there was really nothing surprising about any of the plot twists either. Maybe it was me, but right away I knew exactly that it would go something like this. Main character does more detective work that continues to support his theory of the murderous neighbor. Neighbor catches on to the fact that he is being spied upon and has interactions with friends and family members of the main character, seemingly putting them in danger. Main character tries to alert these friends and family members as well as police to the suspicious neighbor. They don't believe him given his past behavior. Neighbor seems clean in their eyes. Boy cries wolf one too many times.On a positive note, the acting was very good. Shia LaBeouf was excellent as Kale Brecht, a well-meaning but troubled teen who was burdened by the death of his father. David Morse once again played the role of dark, emotionally disturbed psychopath to perfection. It seems like every time they are casting a part like that in a movie, David Morse is on speed dial. Sarah Roemer, while very charming as girl next door, Ashley Carlson, seemed nothing more than eye candy in the whole scheme of things. The subplot about the romance between her and Kale did not seem necessary to the plot.It's not that 'Disturbia' is a bad movie, it was just a somewhat disappointing movie. Had I watched it with lower expectations, I may have felt better about it. I would still recommend it since I've heard many other people say that they did enjoy it.",5,1,3,27 November 2007
Man on the Moon," Kind of a pointless movie.
","When I first heard that Jim Carrey was going to star in a film about the life of Andy Kauffman, I couldn't wait to get to the theater. However, I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. I was looking forward to finding out what Andy Kauffman was really like outside of his comic routine.However, by the end of this film, I still have no idea who he really was. This film put too much focus on Andy's comic routines and not enough on his personal life and problems. I learned more about Andy from 'E! The True Hollywood Story' than I did from this film. This movie should have been titled 'Man On The Man: The Comedic Talents of Andy Kauffman' because it really wasn't very much of a biography.",4,0,0,11 July 2000
Meet Joe Black," If this movie doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will!!
","I cannot believe that I actually sat through this boring piece of cinematic trash.  Those were the longest three hours of my life.  By the end of this movie, I had no idea what was going on or what had happened nor did I really care.  I kept wanting to just close my eyes but I kept thinking that maybe this movie will get better.  However it never did. What was Brad Pitt thinking when he read the script for this movie?  His movies are either really good(i.e. The Fight Club, A River Runs Through It, Seven) or really horrible(i.e. The Devil's Own, Seven Years In Tibet). 
So, if you're having problems sleeping, just put this movie in and you'll get to sleep really quick.",4,0,1,16 July 2000
Mulholland Drive," Not for everyone.
","This movie was terrible!! How in the world was it once ranked in the top 100 movies on this site (thankfully it isn't even in the top 250 anymore). It made absolutely no sense no matter how hard you try to analyze it.I love movies where you have to think and watch several times to fully understand, but I feel with this movie no matter how many times you watch it, you'll never have a clue what it's about. Every character in this movie is scary. Most of them seemingly had nothing to do with the movie as whole. You'll talk about this movie and have dreams about it. Just not in a good kind of way. I give this movie a 1 out of ten. If I could give it less than a 1, I would. Maybe you have to be a David Lynch fan to enjoy it. I'm not and I hated this movie.",1,3,11,27 May 2002
For Love of the Game," Okay but not very memorable.
","This was just one of those films that wasn't horrible but after sitting through it, I just felt something was missing. After most good films, you leave the theater feeling rewarded. This just wasn't a very satisfying film. I don't know if it was overly long running time (I felt like I had sat through an actual major league game after it was over), the predictability (anyone with half a brain could have predicted the ending), or the fact that this was nothing really more than a love story disguised as a sports films.When this movie came out, they promoted like it was the next 'Field of Dreams' or 'The Natural'.  It didn't even come close to matching those films. I just didn't feel that Kevin Costner's character Billy Chapell had any charisma. I just didn't care about him the same way I cared about Ray Kinsella or Roy Hobbs. If anything, this movie kind of reminded me of 'Jerry Maguire' without the charm, energy, witty dialogue, or supporting cast. I give this movie a 5 out of 10.",6,1,2,4 July 2003
