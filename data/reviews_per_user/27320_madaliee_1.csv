The Mask," A Lighthearted Comic Strip Movie That Proved to Be Ground-breaking in the Special Effects Department
","I remember watching all the hype before this film came out.  So much attention was plowed into the fact that the special effects made the movie and that you should RUN to the cinema just to see them.  But what they didn't say was that it's a highly entertaining film.  Yes, it's based on a comic strip, and yes Jim Carrey goes looney in it.  But even if you don't like Jim Carrey and hate Cameron Diaz at her gorgeous best, it's still definately worth a look.I saw this film again on DVD 6 years after it's release and I have to say the special effects still are impressive.  That's going to be the thing in the future, whether the special effects can stand the test of time, compared to the old style which you tend to watch now and cringe.  I sit there sometimes at some old films and think 'god I thought this was amazing when it came out'.  I'm happy to say, after my hour of waffling that this is a very enjoyable film.  Go on, rent it!",Null,0,0,9 January 2001
