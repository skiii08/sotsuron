Blade Runner 2049," A disappointment, to be sure...
","An unnecessarily long movie. A fact which would have probably passed me by if it was any good. The plot was diabolical. Sci-fi movies NEED a believable plot. Movies about paranormal horror, or real-life movies are allowed to break that premise, but all good sci-fi is based on a BELIEVABLE story. Amazingly sophisticated androids â€“ believable. Used as slaves â€“ believable. They rebelled â€“ believable. A task force was assembled to eliminate them â€“ believable. All that was B.R.2019. 'Plot of B.R.2049' - simply unrealistic! Now that we have established you need to put your brain to one side lets carry on the evaluation. The acting was sufficient. I think Gosling was good. The scenery & effects were very good. The atmosphere was faithfully represented. But there is only so long these things can keep you fixed to your seat. And 3 hours is well past that mark. The last fight is, indeed very good. But your interest in the characters in minimal and you are fairly tired by then.Finally I think they have used 'infrasounds'. Those inaudible sounds they use in horror movies to unnerve the viewer. And the audible bits were too loud and of such low frequency the whole auditorium was vibrating. Frankly painful.Overall I would say it got right: scenery, effects, atmosphere. It got wrong: plot, length, noises. Which gets it 6/10. A disappointment, to be sure!",6,7,13,30 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," *** A V O I D !!!
","If you are of an age to have fallen in love with the originals then keep away from this. It is a ghastly 'frankenstein' of all the bits of the originals that made us fall in love with them. Stitched together by a grim determination to make a quick buck or two: Poorly timed attempts at humour, atrocious acting, 'life wisdoms' clumsily thrust down your throat, bizarre diversions into minor-character side-plots, vacuous scenes of 'self-exploration', clumsy dialogue... The actual pain kicked in when a young girl - deserted for days on a clump of rock to learn an esoteric religion from an old hermit - seems to meticulously re-apply her make up each morning. Why? To empower women? To teach the little people the power of makeup? She is plenty-pretty already.
What they got right: They pleasantly introduced some technological advancements in the 30-some years between the two eras. Snoke was semi-interesting. Finally, Kylo Ren was above average.
But these are minor points. Hence I gave it 2 / 10.",2,1,2,22 December 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Classic
","A harrowing depiction of post-apocalyptic life with amazing scenery, staggering amount of detail, VERY brief and succinct dialogue, constant shifting of allegiances and a keep-you-guessing story line. Just gives me the impression this was an intricate creative process rather than a money-spinning exercise by Hollywood. 2 hours of utter mayhem!",10,5,9,13 September 2017
