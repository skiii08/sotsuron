Blade Runner 2049," King of all Sequels
","This is how sequels should be made. Not pale imitations or rehash's but driving the story and craft of film-making forward while staying true to the essence of the original.
It drips in pure class from start to finish. I would watch 4 hours more without getting restless if they had made it. Gosling and Villeneuve are as good as Ford and Scott. My only gripe was that Leto didn't get enough screen time.
The poor box office return, let down by the misfiring marketing, means we might have to wait another 30 years for the next Actor/Director super duo to give us more. Until then, enjoy this over and over again!",10,0,11,8 September 2019
