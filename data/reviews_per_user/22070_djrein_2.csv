Requiem for a Dream," Truly Great Art
","Everyone watches movies for different reasons. Some are simply looking to be entertained, which usually means their idea of a good movie is a movie that only contains enough of the bad part of life in order for the characters to overcome in the end. Many good films have been made that deal with a character overcoming problems to triumph in the end. For us that want something deeper, this is a great movie. I have read reviews of this film that claim it is overrated because it is simply a story about weak people or losers reaping what they sowed. That is not the point. What makes this movie great, one of many things, is that it describes very effectively how people go down the wrong path. This movie is maybe the best film i have ever seen in terms of portraying real human beings. It is pure hell, and that is exactly what the characters were experiencing. I can understand why many did not enjoy the movie, but it is a shame how many people, according to their commments, did not have sympathy for the characters. This is not one of my favorite movies, but i recognize great art when i see it. It not only is a four-star film, but one of the truly groundbreaking movies of its kind. I only wish everyone understood it. Why then is it not one of my favorite movies? Because all of my favorite films make me feel happy, joyful, and inspired. However, this movie touched me in a different way, but touched me in a way that is equally positive, in that we should never underestimate our vulnerability. That is something no one wants to truly face. This movie is not for those who, as Jack Nicholson said, 'can't handle the truth!! '",9,0,1,15 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Guaranteed Enjoyment!
","Sometimes we judge movies as a critic might, overanalyzing, comparing to very complex theater. This movie is a classic example that a film should primarily be judged on whether it was enjoyable to watch. I don't care how anyone rate's this film, but those who did not like this movie probably don't like sex, pizza, or rock n' roll either. Rent it soon!",Null,0,1,9 June 2002
