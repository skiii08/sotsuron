Spartacus," One of the best of the bunch when it comes to religious epics - except it doesn't qualify as one!
","Alongside Ben-Hur (or perhaps slight behind it), this is the greatest mammoth-production ever made. It has a great deal of what makes a classic; a marvellous (yet slightly wooden) Kirk Douglas in the role of Spartacus - a brutal hero who has no mercy. None of that makes sense. Let me just point out: This is a great movie, far beyond its time. See it. See it with your girlfriend, your wife, your parents and your slaves. :o)",8,0,1,12 September 1999
Barry Lyndon," A right hand drama
","This is a film just so wonderful that it almost beats itself. Music (yet not entirely written specially for this occasion), costumes(might have never been beaten), acting (though with lack of character development, which brings it down to a mere 9 out of 10), setting and story, full with laughs, irony and real emotional scenes.Oh, get a hold of this one, I beg you!",9,1,2,1 October 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Simply a superb masterpiece
","It truly is british from top to bottom. Well made from the beginning to the end with essential craftmanship and so utterly polished that it outshines almost any other movie in the world, grand and bombastic from overture to end-credits, beautifully filmed in Panavision 70 with lots of colossal mammoth-like scenes. Yet it is touching in a way big screen epics almost never are, or never were. For this motion picture is not just a production grande, it is also an intament tale of a human being.The character development is wonderful, the views are terrifficly awesome(as widescreen-version on a fair TV or, preferably, at the cinema), the music is as stunning as it is suggestive and the acting is rock-solid.I have no complaints about this movie, none whatsoever. It's so wonderful, you couldn't ask for anything else in a motion picture than you can find in this one(except women, of course!!!). Get a hold of it, find the directors cut widescreen version(accept no other) and sit back. You're in for the treat of your life.",10,0,2,11 November 1999
Ben-Hur," Will we ever see the like again?
","Though it was less than half a year ago I first saw this masterpiece, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. And usually it takes a while for me to really accept movies and it takes a while before I really take them to me, this has been the case of almost every film I've ever seen.As for Ben-Hur, this is not the case. I am not at all amazed (or even impressed) by the many Academy Awards it received. As far as I'm concerned, if a film that wins eleven Oscars, then the only thing to be sure of is that it appeals to Americans and a great American crowd. And that's not always a good thing.Awards, nominations, hype and everything that has to do with frenzy put aside, this still is an enormous production. So very mighty and so very grand in scale, so very entertaining and so very well-made. We may never see the liking, the most of us have realized that we didn't see an equal in Titanic.Charlton Heston gives the character of Judah Ben-Hur all the magnitude it needs and he brings a strong impact. Many people are fond of Hugh Griffithin the role of Sheik Ilderiim for which he won an Oscar. I am too, but the most impressive actor of them all in my opinion is, Stephen Boyd as Messala. The scene where Ben-Hur and Messala speak to each other for the last time (the scene right after the chariot race) surely could have appealed enough to the American crowd to bring Boyd an Oscar. For a newcomer, he was an excellent and promising one.The movie itself in its full glory may be dated, but not enough for it to be ridiculous at any standard at all. It still stands up among newcomers and will continue to do so for ages to come.Truly nothing beats a classic.",10,2,3,7 October 1999
