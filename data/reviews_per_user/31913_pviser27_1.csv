Skyfall," Best Bond Yet !
","I did not expect the bond movie 'sky fall' to be so amazing this time partly because Bond it self sounds very monotonous and the we know its all about the spy game, but whats truly amazing this time is the PLOT of this movie which will blow your mind if you pay attention to the details of it. Great acting by all of the bond crew, wonderful theme/overall moral of the movie and a striking dialog ' orphans make....' that psychological makes sense.A must watch for all Bond fans and of course Fans who love thriller movies and good plots.thanks for reading .",10,8,18,25 November 2012
