The Blair Witch Project," Fooled Again
","The marketers deserve massive credit for this mediocre film's success -- I hope they negotiated for a big part of the gross. Maybe it's the Adam Sandler crowd who thinks this stuff's spooky, maybe I'm just getting old and cranky, but my main emotion was annoyance, not fear. I liked the bundles of sticks, though.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Memento," funny reactions...
","Having now seen Memento twice, and having discussed some plot details with friends, I went through the comments on IMDB looking for more insights. I did find a few -- thanks! -- but mostly I'm struck by the observation that many people who seemingly didn't follow the plot nonetheless LOVE this film. It's really so good that you don't have to 'get it' to admire the hell out of it.And, naturally, a good number of those who misunderstand the plot and/or underestimate the story's integrity HATE it. The sneers directed at a legitimate masterpiece (and the many viewers who rate it one) are, in a word, pathetic...**Spoilers****Spoilers**Memento is absolutely not about a plucky protagonist earnestly trying to find an anonymous assailant and avenge his wife's death. It's about our boy Lenny fumbling through an impossibly complicated psychological maze until, in a moment of perfect clarity, he concocts a happy ending for himself. It's also about a fascinated Teddy toying for a while with a dangerous freak but ultimately failing to foresee how a human mind might turn its own fatal flaw into an awesome weapon. If you consider Lenny's likely fate after the last scene -- how he will interpret his tatoos and unburned polaroids for the rest of his life (presumably back in the mental hospital) it's clear that Leonard managed to resolve (for himself) the crushing and seemingly impossible dilemma of his own guilt.",10,0,1,31 July 2001
American Beauty," True Beauty
","It's high time that someone reminded those Americans with particularly tight sphincters that they (and those around them) could enjoy their lives more (and discover more meaning in their lives) if they dedicated themselves to enjoying their lives more. And that might mean remembering stuff they once enjoyed doing and trying those things again. Here in the Land of the Free, this seemingly benign prescription becomes radical stuff when it involves both risking one's pathetic career and firing up the evil weed. There's a lot more going on in this movie and I'm not going to try to cover much of the ground, largely because it's so lovely discovering treasures on your own.Kevin Spacey is building a legacy of greatness, both in his shrewd choices of roles and in their execution. Here he is allowed to do his finest work to date in a part that seems custom-made for his range of emotion and larger-than-life screen presence. Annette Benning is superb as The Wife, as are the remaining members of the cast. The directing by first-timer Sam Mendes is simply fresh and inspired, particularly in the sumptuously choreographed and filmed dream sequences involving rose petals and a perfectly slutty little cheerleader.But the inner beauty of this film is in the way it manages to deftly and comically savage a rich suite of dysfunctions  eroding the mental health and general contentment of the contemporary American family while paying very close attention to positive, hopeful qualities in almost every character. I was amazed and impressed that it was The Wife of all people who brought tears to my eyes. That the audience is allowed to empathize with these folks, rather than simply pointing fingers at their all-too-human deficiencies, is the film's genius.",10,0,0,8 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," BMJ Rocks!
","I couldn't have enjoyed this movie any more than I did. But then I'm a guy who loves an absurd, hilarious, infinitely self-reflecting, post-modern look at such matters as marriage, puppeteering, animal psychology, orientation videos, sex appeal, gender confusion, 60-foot-tall Emily Dickensons, pet obsession, and the semi-cool mystique of second-tier celebrities. So many laughs, so many memorable scenes, and such great performances, especially that of JM himself. What a fascinating way to change one's public image. Now what WAS the name of that jewel thief movie...",10,0,1,4 November 1999
Am√©lie," cute film -- not a masterpiece
","I'd have found this movie more palatable with average-looking people rather than models, but I suppose it's more natural for movie-goers to root for really good-looking people. This film taps into our fantasy is that the dreamers are out there, somewhere, hoping that we'll see that they're not just physically gorgeous, but also quirky, thoughtul, inventive, and ready to embrace and nurture our own lovable quirks. Still, I'm surprised that IMDB users have ranked this film so absurdly high on the all-time list. C'est la vie!I enjoyed the story's cleverness and twists, and there's a nice message about avoiding voyeuristic titillation and living one's own life, but by the end the project felt hollow and overly long. I agree with an earlier commentor that Marc Caro's influence might have helped this venture by providing a little more darkness. I loved 'Delicatessan' several years ago -- think I'll rent it again and refresh my memory.",5,0,3,26 November 2001
The Matrix," Agent Smith Rocks
","I'll ditto most of the accolades given this movie by my fellow viewers, and add highest praise for Hugo Weaving's rendition of the incredible Agent Smith -- what a consummate creep, and funny as hell -- the forehead, the deadpan barely-hiding-disgust delivery of his lines -- my pick for Best Supporting Actor.One minor nit to pick -- am I the only one bothered when an entire movie depends on everyone's inability to shoot straight?!?",Null,0,0,18 June 1999
