Raiders of the Lost Ark," one of the best movies ever made
","first time i saw this movie i was a little boy and i loved it ,now many years later i still think it is a great story and movie making at its best.Harrison Ford as Indiana is great. there was everything in this movie drama, comedy and when i was younger i was a bit afraid of the scary parts. The special effects(snakes etc.)dont look as good as when the movie first came out but they are still great. so enjoy",10,0,0,31 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great,a lot of fun
","very good movie finally George Lucas is back on track,great story ,great action. a little too much CGI and a bit slow in the first half, other than that Star Wars is back. i was hoping that after the Phantom Menace fiasco we will get something good and we did.The only bad thing now is that we have to wait till 2005 for the third one.",10,0,0,18 May 2002
