Spartacus," masterpiece!but have some flaws.
","i watch this classic in my summer vocation,and i really been shocked!yes i am a strong admirer of Spartacus,i love him,he is my hero!i read Raffaello(an Italian writer)'s Spartacus when i was only 11. back to the movie.i...i can only say:gods,it's...oh,wonderful!terrific!magnificent!gorgeous!it's a masterpiece!'Spartacus'is one of my favorite films,i'll love it forever! but it still has some flaws.what a pity that Douglas chose Fast's novel,he should choose Raffaello's,i read Fast's 'Spartacus' when i was 15,and i felt very very very disappointed,strange i couldn't find Raffaello's 'Spartacus' on amazon.English speaking countries never translate it? overall,Douglas's 'Spartacus' is a masterpiece,and 2004 one cannot overcome it,actually the new 'Spartacus' made me feel a little boring,i don't like Rhona Mitra's Varinia,and hate Crixus(i forgot actor's name,i like John Ireland's Crixus). 9/10P.S.:i love Tony Curtis's character Antoninus,what a pretty and talented boy!i can't help to cry when i heard he sing the poem.his death is a real tragedy,hat off to Trumbo,he created such a flawless character!and Curtis,perfect performance!thanks!",10,1,3,14 September 2007
