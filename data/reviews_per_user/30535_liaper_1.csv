Blade Runner 2049," Don't buy into the negative hype. It's a good film.
","I was NOT hyped to see this movie. The original is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I was talked into seeing this sequel by my fianc√©e. I was not disappointed! I really dig the amazing visuals and powerful music. The story wasn't as deep and thought provoking as the first movie by a longshot, but the characters were interesting and the story was engaging. It seems like most of the bad reviews were left by people unrealistically expecting a sci fi masterpiece instead of a sequel. We get it, the sequels's not going to surprise you as the first movie did when you were younger and more easily impressed.",8,4,14,7 October 2017
