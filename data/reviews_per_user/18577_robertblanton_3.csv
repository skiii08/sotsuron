3:10 to Yuma," 'Ahm gonna keel me sum law-men, Mabel!'
","Here is an undeniable truth of movie reviewers: When you really want to promote a movie that's not that good, talk about the great performances of the actors. Then you can praise the movie to high heaven, feel you have done your penance, and content yourself with the ingenuity of your expansive insights. This is the case with 3:10 to Yuma.So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, let's just look at the last 20 or so minutes of the film: 1. Apparently the bartender/hotel clerk in Contention, AZ, whom we've not been introduced to until this point in the movie, is in cahoots with the bad guys because he make a point of surreptitiously and eagerly directing the bad guys to the location of the incarcerated Mr. Crowe. Why does he do this? Who knows. The filmmaker never lets us in on the secret.2. Apparently the Neanderthal menfolk of Contention, AZ, are a simple-minded lot who, at the thought of earning $200.00 by murdering the the folks holding murderous Russell Crowe in custody, just can't wait to start throwing lead. 'Mabel, Whar's mah raffle? Ahm gonna keel me sum law-men an geet myselves $200.00 dollah cash on that thar barrelhead!' 3. Apparently no one in Contention has a problem with watching their unarmed police force viciously gunned down in broad daylight. After this atrocity, folks continue to wander the streets, go in and out of stores, and continue their daily lives as though nothing has happened. Except for, of course, the menfolk who are hiding in wait for a chance to earn that $200.00.4. Apparently no one bothers to theorize that when you are firing dozens of rounds of ammunition at two men who are as close together as they can be without being Siamese twins you just might hit the guy you're trying to rescue.5. Apparently, when Russell Crowe's psychotic gunslinging hero-worshiping gang member finally realizes the implications of the above, he figures he better start shootin' them menfolk he'd promised that thar munny to. Of course, none of the surviving menfolk think to start shooting at him.6. Apparently--well, you get the idea. In other words, this excuse for movie-making is, quite frankly, stupid! In order to take this seriously, you must convince yourself that the type of behavior exhibited by many of the characters in this film is the way people really act. Whether it be the above examples, or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach, at close range, having the bullet removed, and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him, much of this film is just plain ludicrous! By the way, I'm no gun expert, but I do know this: If you are shot in the stomach at close range you ain't gonna be going' nowhere and you certainly ain't gonna be trottin' around on a horse! The bigger problem with this movie is its message, which is this: People who do the right thing because it's the right thing to do are fools. Good people don't thrive. As Christian Bale says, 'I've been asking God to help me for three years and he hasn't done it yet.' For those who would attempt to live a righteous, honorable life there is nothing but despair and hopelessness. In fact, at the end of the movie the true hero of the piece is the psychopathic, vicious, murdering Russell Crowe character. And, by the way, this film does NOT retain the ending of the original, so if you were hoping it would, forget about that.If you see this film, you might recognize material from other Westerns. You have an iron clad stagecoach, reminiscent of John Wayne's 'War Wagon,' quotes from the Bible, reminiscent of Randolph Scott in 'Ride the High Country,' the psychological bantering between the Crowe and Christian Bale characters, reminiscent of not only 'Ride the High Country' but also of 'The Tall T', an Elmore Leonard story with Randolph Scott and Richard Boone, and Christian Bales's cursing teenage son, reminiscent of Ron Howard in John Wayne's 'The Shootist.' Your better bets: All of the other movies I named above plus the original with Glen Ford and Van Heflin.",4,175,291,7 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," The Return of Buddy Love
","'Who,' one may ask, 'is Buddy Love?' Well, it's like this: in the original 'The Nutty Professor,' Jerry Lewis plays a nerd scientist who invents a Jekyll/Hyde formula that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant ladies man who calls himself 'Buddy Love.' In this movie, Peter Parker comes under the influence of some type of alien life-form that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant lades man who calls himself--well, he still calls himself Peter Parker. Not that being influenced by Mr. Lewis' film is bad; actually it's a pretty humorous part of the movie.Other highlights: 1. Bruce Campbell should be the next Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Take a look at his supporting performance and see if you don't agree that he has that Clouseau thing down pat. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to learn that he was purposely imitating the great detective.2. The score was exceptional. It reminded me of the kinds of scores you might find in movies of the 30's and 40's.3. Kirsten Dunst sings Irving Berlin, and you can't beat Irving Berlin. I thought she was going to sing Peggy Lee's 'Fever' (the introduction to the song is played in the nightclub scene), but she didn't. And Chubby Checkers sings 'The Twist.' In fact, this movie, to me, hearkened back to great action films of yesterday. It has the feel of a 1940's serial, with one action scene built upon another. Truthfully, expect for some minor cussing and maybe one violent part, this movie would fit perfectly into that time period.I have only three negative criticisms: one, it's too long. I enjoyed it once, but I wouldn't want to sit through it again in the near future, unless, maybe, I wanted to visit an IMAX theater. Second, too much of it is obviously a cartoon. It looks like the computer generated images it is. Third, as in all action movies today, the film is populated with action shots made of closeups and herky-jerky motions so that the viewer really can't see the action the filmmaker is supposed to showing him.So, great move; just a little too long.",8,0,1,10 May 2007
Super 8," Calling Walter Kronkite, Calling Walter Kronkite
","I called this 'Calling Walter Kronkite' because you see him at the beginning of the film, and as the film pro or regresses one wonders why someone just doesn't call 60 minutes or some other outfit to investigate the strange goings on in this town. I mean when all your dogs go missing, dozens of automobile engines are stolen overnight, etc., etc. doesn't that sound as though a major news organization might be interested in those mysterious events? Apparently not. Does this town not have a newspaper, or a television station, or any other communication with the outside world? After all, this is 1979 not 1949. Guess not.However, putting that aside, I marked spoiler but the next statements are not (I don't think) spoilers because they occur near the beginning of the movie. But, just in case. So, here goes: A huge train towing I don't know how many cars (but lots) comes barreling full speed along a railroad track when a pickup truck turns onto the rails and heads full tilt toward the rushing train. The engine, of course, hits the truck at full speed, the train goes off the track, and railroad cars fly as though someone threw a handful of toothpicks across a room. Wow! Yeah. Do you know what would happen to a train with the force of a dozen or more speeding rail cars behind it if it hit a puny pickup truck? Nothing, that's what. Do you know what would happen to the pickup truck and it's occupant? They would be disintegrated into millions of tiny little pieces, that's what. But not this truck, no-sir-ee, it's still in one piece, a little mangled, but in one piece. And the guy driving it? No need to worry, he's alive, oh, banged up and a little bloody, but not too bad off at all. This should be insulting to any true lover of film or sci-fi because it tells you that the director thinks you're a mindless boob who will praise him no matter how outlandish the story line he delivers to you is. The end of this movie (which I will not reveal) is even stupider than this, reminding one too much of the Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skulls climatic fiasco. As to other aspects of this film, it should have been rated R. It is filled with cursing from the beginning to the end, with the chubby kid having basically a one word vocabulary that rhymes with 'hit,' which he says over and over and over and. . . . Once he says the 'P' word, the one that used to describe a cat, in front of the 14 or 15 year old heroine and she says, 'Oh, that's OK.' Really? Chubs just called his male friend a term to indicate that his his friend was weak, a pansy, and cowardly, which, since that word is used to refer to the female anatomy and females in general, also means you little girl, and that's 'OK?' Then there's the other hero of the film, the doper, the guy who offers to supply drugs to the kids, but, really, man, uh, you know, it's OK, he's cool. He's a good guy. He's a hero. So, the messages to the targeted audience of youth this is aimed at are clear: 1. It's OK to curse. Be sure to do it hard, loud and obnoxiously; 2. Girls are trash and should not be offended by boys who talk dirty around them. They should recognize their inferior place in society and just accept themselves for the pathetic losers they are; and 3. Dopers aren't so bad. Just because they try to sell young teens drugs doesn't make them evil. They're just trying to get by. Yours truly, Uncle Steven and cousin J.J.",1,32,62,13 June 2011
