Ford v Ferrari," Thoroughly enjoyed this movie
","Based on a true story, 'Ford v. Ferrari' is a highly entertaining thrill ride even if you, like me, are not a racing fan or auto aficionado. During the driving scenes at Daytona and Le Mans, I felt like I was in the car! While many action movies today rely heavily on CGI razzle dazzle and outrageous surrealism, this movie gives you action in a more realistic, gritty depiction. You feel how dangerous this sport is, particularly in the '60s. Matt Damon and Christian Bale both give terrific, multidimensional performances as Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, respectively. Great chemistry between them. They're flawed, realistic characters, passionate about their work and very likable. You root for them. Go see this movie!",10,2,4,29 December 2019
Child 44," Relentlessly grim
","'Child 44' has a stellar cast and a classic premise: A tough, gritty cop on the hunt for a gruesome serial child killer. The twist is that the 'cop' is a Stalin-era MGB agent, Leo (Tom Hardy). He's a former orphan who became a war hero, and now lives in a spacious apartment with his beautiful schoolteacher wife, Raisa (Noomi Rapace). The plot, based on an award-winning novel, is convoluted, but mainly hinges on Leo's growing interest in a mysterious string of deaths of young boys, and his dogged determination to crack the case as his privileged status in the Soviet hierarchy unravels. Yet the film is weighed down by too many side plots, and hits you over the head with endless examples of how horrible it was to live under the Stalin regime. 'Child 44' is a relentlessly grim movie, with heaps of gratuitous violence (even when it doesn't really advance the story). Many of the scenes are dimly lit, everything colored in browns and grays. Leo and Raisa have a strange, uneven relationship, and it's very hard to grasp her motivation for doing anything she does in this film, other than that she was living in a constant state of fear because she's in a totalitarian state. Her character makes no sense, even though she's in most of the scenes. A waste of a great actress like Rapace (the original 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo').The serial killer plot feels stale. 'Child 44' seems less focused on the mystery solving and more on all the suspicion, backstabbing, blackmail, ratting out on your friends, police state brutality and bureaucratic oppression of the old USSR. I love Tom Hardy, and he does infuse his portrayal of Leo with pathos, longing, pain and gritty determination to do the right thing in a corrupt system. But this film's script and direction are just muddled. Kids, if you want to watch a far superior, engaging movie with a similar premise, opt for 'Gorky Park' instead. Sorry! With some of my favorite actors in the cast, I wanted to like this more than I did.",4,0,0,28 August 2018
Darkest Hour," Great lead performance by Oldman
","'Darkest Hour' is all about Churchill's role in guiding his country through this very perilous time. Joe Wright's film lionizes him to a great extent, although some of the great man's vulnerabilities (self-doubt, fear) and shortcomings (temper, bullheadedness, tendency to flash his secretary) are shown without varnish. I felt that the best thing about this film was Oldman's performance, and as usual, he dives deeply into the character's speech and mannerisms with perfection. Not so easy when you consider how many screen portrayals of Churchill there have been, including several in just the last decade. The rest of the movie is a bit predictable in its portrayal of these well-known events, but enjoyable enough. Of the supporting cast performances, I thought Kristin Scott Thomas did a great job as Clementine Churchill, capturing her strength, razor wit and look very well, and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax was just fine, although I am weary of seeing Dillane scowl and glower through so many parts. Lily James plays Churchill's loyal stenographer, and provides a sweet, gentle foil to the thunderous orator in their scenes together. But she seems very much the same as she's been in other roles. If you are interested in Churchill or WW2 history, you may enjoy 'Darkest Hour' very much, especially if you remember that time period (like my dad, who said he just loved this movie). It lacks dramatic action and tension to be a truly great movie, though.",7,0,4,1 March 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Plenty of action but perhaps too goofy
","I enjoyed both 'Thor' and 'Thor: The Dark World,' so I was looking forward to 'Thor: Ragnarok.' I thought this third installment had way too many silly, goofy, corny jokes, and tongue-in-cheek, wink-wink cameos. However, Cate Blanchett makes a very stylish villain as Hela (and looks spectacular in her costume), and the clashes between Thor, Loki, Heimdall, etc. and the baddies are well done -- lots of action, music (Led Zeppelin for the moms and dads in the audience!), explosions, CGI, etc. This movie would have been much better with 30% fewer wisecracks and winks to the fourth wall, however. I had the feeling that the screenplay was written by someone who had dropped acid.",5,3,7,7 July 2018
The Revenant," Stunning visuals, tense action
","'The Revenant' is a visual and visceral triumph. There are magnificent landscapes, rushing rivers, raging waterfalls, brilliant skies. You truly feel enveloped by nature and sense the constant struggle that the main character, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), endures as he battles the harsh elements. Nature puts Glass, an experienced fur trapper, through a lot, but his fellow man turns out to be far more vicious. DiCaprio's performance as Glass is truly grueling; he has relatively little dialogue (mostly because he's struggling to survive), but he transmits every emotion in the book as he endures agonizing physical and emotional pain, and ultimately, spiritual enlightenment. 'The Revenant' has some tense, well-staged action scenes amid spectacular scenery and set to a lush symphonic score. Tom Hardy is pure evil as vicious trapper Fitzgerald, Glass' enemy and the object of his vengeance. Hardy's and DiCaprio's scenes together fairly crackle as these two characters battle it out in some epic fight scenes. Some of the dialogue and plot is hard to follow, perhaps because the film goes for authenticity over clarity in some aspects. However, it offers stark beauty and at times, dreadful terror.",9,1,1,16 January 2019
Dunkirk," Vivid, sweeping drama with almost no character exposition
","I appreciated Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the events in 'Dunkirk,' and how he focused on the sounds and sights to connect the audience to the terror and uncertainty experienced by those who were involved. Visually, it's very exciting, especially the dogfights in the skies and the strafing of boats on the water. He obviously made a conscious decision to reveal almost nothing of a personal nature about any of these characters, including their names in some cases. You simply don't know anything about them, which is risky in a movie. Why should the audience care about some character we don't know? As the movie plays out, you do come to fill in those gaps a bit due to the excellent actors involved, particularly Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Jack Lowden. I assume Nolan's purpose for doing this was to show that it was this very large group of individuals coming together to do something miraculous in a time of global peril, when truly, their whole world and way of life was in jeopardy. Still, I couldn't help thinking that he might have added a few minutes here and there to give us more information or background on these men. The younger ones seem completely anonymous and almost blank.The soundtrack is very loud at times, and there's 'ticking' that conveys the sense of danger and impending doom. It's almost as if you hear these men's hearts beating because they're just terrified. The action scenes are very well done. U.S. viewers (particularly younger ones) who are not familiar with the events of Dunkirk or the larger geopolitical situation of the start of WW2 would do well to read up on it a bit before seeing 'Dunkirk,' because Christopher Nolan is not wasting any film on explaining it all to you. I think people who like war movies in general or scenes with edge-of-your-seat action will enjoy this movie, but anyone who wants deeper character exposition will find it wanting.",7,3,4,28 February 2018
Donnie Brasco," Gritty, dark, powerful mob drama
","I saw 'Donnie Brasco' years ago and recently watched it again. Excellent, pleasingly subtle performances from Johnny Depp, Al Pacino and Michael Madsden make this movie well worth your time. The storyline--FBI agent Joe Pistone's undercover journey into the dark, violent world of the Bonnano crime family and how he develops a close bond with mobster Ben 'Lefty' Ruggiero that leaves him guilt-ridden about his deception (albeit in a quest to stop organized criminal activity)--keeps you fairly riveted throughout a long-ish movie. His stint as a fake jewel fencer named 'Donnie Brasco' continues for years as his relationship with his long-suffering wife and kids in the suburbs is stretched to the limit. While there are plenty of details that seem like mob movie cliches at this point (although Pistone was a close advisor to the movie's production and said that what was shown was highly accurate), one thing that struck me about 'Donnie Brasco' that distinguishes it from other films in this genre was that it does not glamorize the Mafia culture or violent crime. These seem like desperate men constantly pressured to produce revenue for their superiors, and their world seems grubby, tense and unappealing. Pacino's Lefty is bitter, an ill, aging man depressed by broken promises and dead ends in his life who dreams of breaking free, although he knows that is impossible. A very different character from Michael Corleone, the wizard-like Mafia don at the pinnacle of power who manipulates the men around him like chess pieces. Lefty knows he is a pawn. He smells doom and you can smell it too.Depp's Pistone/Brasco internalizes his guilt and horror, and you can see it eat away at him as he interacts with his real family in brief visits that are heart-wrenching or with his FBI contacts. You see his horror when he witnesses the violence of the gang's crimes, and this movie does not turn the violence into opera or comedy as other films in this genre have done--it is messy and awkward. Victims suffer. The camera doesn't spare you that experience. That aspect of this film impressed me the most. Interesting that the director was Mike Newell of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'!!Michael Madsden's portrayal of Sonny Black is terrific -- he is truly menacing in his quiet moments. The rest of the supporting players do a fine job. Watch for two young actors in one scene in bit parts, Tim Blake Nelson and Paul Giammati, years before they became famous. Definitely watch 'Donnie Brasco' if you are interested in true crime, the Mafia or tense character dramas. It captures a grubby, gritty, bleak corner of American life so well.",8,1,1,22 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi is the last Star Wars movie I'll watch
","I'd heard plenty of grumbles from dedicated Star Wars aficionados about Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. I'm not an obsessive SW series fan, but I was one of those kids (age 8 at the time) who sat in a suburban movie theater in the summer of 1977, enthralled by the original 'Star Wars.' The magical universe full of exotic, as well as very human, characters, an epic battle of good against evil, thrilling space battle scenes, etc. 'The Force Awakens' rekindled my interest, mainly because of the new, young characters: Rey, Kyle, Finn and Poe. However, the 'The Last Jedi' was poorly written from start to finish. The characters and conflicts are predictable, repetitive, flat. It's the same storyline over and over again. Star cameos and corny jokes don't make up for good writing. There were also too many obvious deus ex machina plot twists, like a very wooden Princess Leia floating through space to be miraculously saved (and unscarred) after an explosion. If the First Order/Empire (is there any real distinction?) is going to kill Leia, then let them do it, and let it be realistic. Even Yoda's crotchety ghost appearing seemed like a boring cliche. The SW fans who take their 'canon' very seriously will disagree with me on this, but as a longtime movie fan, it was more than obvious in 'The Force Awakens' that Ben/Kylo and Rey are totally hot for each other. Why is Star Wars so averse to sex and romance? I was waiting for a tasteful clinch between these two. The director teased us with the Force Skype chat, and the 'I can feel your hand across light-years of empty space' jazz, but when he had the opportunity to create a really powerful moment-Kylo becoming Ben again, sabotaging the First Empire by assassinating Snoke and then, passionately embracing Rey so they can join forces as a mighty rebel Jedi duo-he wimped out. No kiss, no romance, no surprises. 'The Last Jedi' just seemed very long, predictable, boring, chaste, too heavily reliant on special effects/graphics, too heavily reliant on tropes lifted from the previous films. I'm out.",2,8,10,29 July 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," Layered, dark fantasy from the maestro Kubrick
","I watched 'Eyes Wide Shut' again last night after first seeing it years ago. Stanley Kubrick's final film is not going to be entertainment for the mass-market audience, who may have been curious about the film's sex scenes based on the trailer set to 'Bad, Bad Thing.' In fact, this film is a surreal, layered, dreamlike exposition on society, social class, marriage, fidelity and truth more than it is about sex, although sexuality, sexual behavior and sexual mores are the prisms through which Kubrick tells this dark fable. In 1999, Tom Cruise was certainly already at the zenith of Hollywood mainstream stardom, so it's interesting that he took this role in order to work with Kubrick, and that Kubrick wanted to cast him as the idealized vision of a square, upstanding, white-bread Manhattan physician devoted to his beautiful, and very bored wife, played by his real-life spouse at the time, Nicole Kidman. I read that Kubrick wanted a real-life couple to explore the darker aspects of married life and sex in the story, and it sounds like he put them through some psychologically painful experiences to elicit the tension required for the two characters. Cruise plays Bill Harford, a man whose ego is absolutely shredded when his wife, Alice, reveals that she wanted to cheat on him the year before. This knowledge leads Bill to embark on a weird night of sexual misadventures that leave him emotionally shattered. Bill is wealthy, handsome and intelligent, but the film shows that he's still a pawn in a decadent, corrupt society where there are far wealthier, far more powerful and manipulative men in charge who use him when it's convenient, and use and discard very beautiful (and frequently naked) women without a fleeing thought for their humanity. 'Eyes Wide Shut' left me with the impression that there is a light and dark side to life and humanity, and that at certain times, we cross back and forth between them, sometimes with titillation and delight, and sometimes with horror. Cruise's Bill is emotionally emasculated by his wife's desire to cheat and by some of his experiences on his night of wandering through New York's sinister side. It's funny how he keeps showing everyone his New York medical license to be sure everyone knows he's a doctor, so you should trust and respect him! I wonder if Kubrick especially liked the fact that Cruise was a few inches shorter than his wife to highlight his feelings of inadequacy (which neither Bill nor Cruise should have, certainly). I found Alice rather cold, possibly written that way, but it felt believable too, as she seemed like a woman who felt unfulfilled and marginalized in her marriage and life, sort of the stereotype of the wealthy doctor's wife whose husband spends long hours at the clinic instead of with her. She lives in a gilded cage but feels trapped and bored. Kubrick famously used color and lighting to great effect, including scenes shot in blue light and scenes soaked in red. The orgy scene felt rather tame for all the fuss. Maybe Kubrick did not intend for there to be any fuss. I feel that the scene was more a metaphor for class and sexual exploitation in our society. Shame on the MPAA for insisting that CGI people be inserted to partially block the view of some sex scenes. Let adults watch Kubrick's film unedited. I was able to view the unedited version of the sequence online, and there was nothing shocking at all. No need to censor it. The blocked view scenes look awkward.",9,0,0,10 June 2020
Moonrise Kingdom," Delightful movie that celebrates first love and human kindness
","I caught 'Moonrise Kingdom' on my on-demand service, and I selected this movie because I enjoyed some of Wes Anderson's earlier films, such as 'Rushmore' and 'The Royal Tenenbaums.' This film's themes, characterizations, music, and whimsical, somewhat surreal visual elements are familiar if you've seen other Anderson movies. (He must have a fantastic record collection, and I do mean vinyl records.) In 'Moonrise Kingdom,' Anderson presents, mostly through the two young leads, the joy and agony of being an adolescent at odds with society and authority, and totally in love for the first time. Both awkward and confident at the same time, Sam and Suzy are unhappy at home for various reasons, and struggle to make friends, but after a chance meeting, forge a bond through letters. (It's set in the 1960s and makes you wish we'd all write letters to each other again.) 'Moonrise Kingdom' is full of big-name stars having a grand time in their roles, with plenty of action, wicked satire and whip-quick dialogue, as well as a beautiful New England island setting. There are also some excellent young actors in the roles of Sam's fellow boy scouts, a subversive crew of fun-loving smart-alecks. But the two lead actors are the film's prize: fresh, unaffected, shy and restrained at times, and passionate. Suspend your cynicism and just enjoy 'Moonrise Kingdom.'",10,0,0,18 January 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Moving film, timely themes, a little convoluted
","Overall, I enjoyed 'Da 5 Bloods,' Spike Lee's newest film made for Netlifx. The cast includes some veteran actors in engaging performances, particularly Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters and Isiah Whitlock, and Chadwick Boseman in an all-too-brief appearance only in flashback scenes. The movie follows four Black Vietnam War veterans as they return to Vietnam on a trip that is, on the surface, a reunion/nostalgia experience combined with an effort to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, Norman (Boseman). However, the four men have a secret mission: to locate a CIA gold stash they discovered and buried decades ago.Lee's bold directorial style shines in the flashback scenes most of all, where he switches to a nostalgic look and narrower screen reminiscent of early '70s movies. 'Da 5 Bloods' combines humor and action with some poignant, sad scenes that explore the lingering emotional scars of the veterans and the impact this had on their families and relationships. Some of the film's flaws may be that it's a bit too long, with a plot that seems convoluted at times, as if they threw too many things into one script. A few of the minor characters, such as a smuggler (or maybe corrupt official? I couldn't tell) played by Jean Reno, don't ring true. The movie can be preachy at times, but I think that's the point, and there's a lot of chemistry between the four vets. I couldn't help wondering how it may have looked and sounded on a big screen, though.",7,0,2,26 June 2020
