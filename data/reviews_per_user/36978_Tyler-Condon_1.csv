Requiem for a Dream," Simply put...Brilliant
","Anyone who hasn't seen this movie must. Consisting of well developed characters, perfectly constructed plot progression, and stylistic directing, this film sets a high standard for modern film-making. Bravo Darren Aronofsky. It seems i need to provide 10 lines of text in order for this comment to be posted. Since anything else i have to say about the movie will either spoil the film or take up too many pages of text, i think i'll just fill the space with random comments. So...Anybody else thing that shotgun cranberry is a funny phrase, because i sure do. By the way, Hamel-Pulsator McLinquidor. What time is the Pants? If you ever come across a man by the name of Ron, tell him that he owes Tman 45 dollars. Anyway, Don't pay any attention to this junk, due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the film in question. This 10 line nonsense is lame. I've wasted approx. 1 min. of my life writing this craziness. I think that's 10 lines.",10,1,2,19 April 2005
