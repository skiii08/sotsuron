Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Whoever thinks this is a bad movie, has not seen it. so don't vote.
","I saw the sneak preview tonight Thursday October 2nd, 2006. I am a fan of borat, And I loved every minute of the movie. My friend who has not seen Borat, won tickets to the free screening and since he knew i was such a big fan, he called me up while i was sleeping , left a message saying 'i got tickets to borat tomorrow at 7:30, we going!' I waited in line, anxiously, they handed out mini posters for the movie and pins for the movie, they had other schwag but i didn't get it,'sigh'. From the beginning of the movie within the first 30 seconds you will laugh, and you will laugh hard. I will not spoil the movie for you, but i know you will laugh so hard that your vocal cords hurt, cause mine do. It's not too short nor a bit too long. You will be cringing at the excitement, and the fact of the embarrassing stuff he says. This movie does not disappoint, and you will not be disappointed.",10,5,18,2 November 2006
"I, Robot"," Seat gripping excitement
","first of all, this would have to be one of, if not the best Will Smith films out there, which really doesn't sound like much until you see the movie, it would have to be a top on the action movie charts , of all time that is, enticing , true to the laws it lays out for you, in more than one way,I would give this a 9.0 i would give it a ten if it weren't for cheesy additives that the director added in. Oh yeah, enjoy the great camera angles. Really, seriously an enjoyable movie, I suggest going to the washroom before-hand. Grab yourself some nacho's, popcorn, and etc. crack open a beer, or 6, and strap in for the ride this movie is. While watching, have this in mind, all of the things the movie is in, are mostly not there, AMAZING.",10,1,2,30 July 2004
