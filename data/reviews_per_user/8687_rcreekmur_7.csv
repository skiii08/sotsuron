Stop-Loss," Hope this movie opens some eyes!
","I know the leaders of this country will view Stop-Loss as a work of fiction, but I hope it manages to open some eyes to the incredible pain and suffering our military action in Iraq is causing to a huge cross section of the American public. Not only have 4000 American lives been lost - and 4000 families paid dearly for the greed of the wealthy - but many thousands more have been maimed for life both mentally and physically all because of the liars who convinced the country this was the right thing to do.There are some incredibly powerful acting performances in this film by a group of young, mostly unknown actors. There is nothing false or unbelievable in any of this film's scenes and the raw emotion comes through with the words, expressions and actions of the perfectly directed cast. It's hard not to get caught up in the emotion - and become angry and what this country has done to a generation of young men and women.I didn't particularly like the hand-held shaky-cam technique used to film the war scenes in Iraq. We've seen this and yes, it's supposed to create a more intense feeling of realism, but it doesn't. It's distracting and makes it harder to follow the action than it should be. I kept hoping they would pull back on it, but they didn't. This is my only real criticism of the entire film and I was glad when things moved back stateside so we could get on with telling the story without letting technique dominate content.As powerful as the performances are of the young men who play soldiers in this movie, the camera sure does love Abbie Cornish. Her role is so pivotal because she represents yet another, deeper level of destruction caused by the war - the people at home who have to cope with the tortured American souls this conflict creates. She steals the scenes in which she appears, and often she doesn't even have to say or do anything to do so. Often her look alone convey more than any words could possibly do.This is a film every American should see - and react to. Stop the damage now! Let's start restoring America's good name in the world and stop being the international bully we've become. We're paying too dear a price in maimed, disabled, dead and scarred American lives. Stop Loss shows it all and if you truly believe the rich in the country are rich enough, do something about it!",9,8,18,28 March 2008
Us," Shyamalan Syndrome?
",I sure hope Jordan Peele isn't the next M. Night Shyamalan. You know... make a massively successful horror/suspense film. Get famous and nominated for all sorts of awards. Become Hollywood's new phenom and have producers throw money your way for a repeat. No restrictions. And then prove it was a fluke by making a bunch of cringe-worthy crap. This film is a totally incomprehensible mess and by the end I just stopped caring what the heck was going on or why. I just wanted it to end. And that's the worst thing a movie can do.,5,5,13,25 March 2019
The Expendables," Stallone Needs to Go to Film School
","I just saw The Expendables. Like most films, I went into this hoping upon hope it would be fantastic. How could it NOT be - with the incredible cast of action stars Stallone had assembled?For the most part I enjoyed it. But why in the world did Stallone shoot almost every action scene in such close-up that you absolutely cannot tell what is happening? It's as if he took a class in how to be action artsy-fartsy in film school and used what he learned to totally screw up his movie. You see blood fly, fists pound flesh, knives slice into throats, guns blaze, bodies drop - and you absolutely can't tell who did what to whom! It's just basic filmmaking incompetence in my opinion. The editing makes it worse by attempting to create frenzy and excitement through rapid cuts that last merely a few frames, but again, it's like someone told them that's the way to create a fast-paced, exciting scene. The quality of the stunt work is excellent, and obviously it was totally unnecessary to split every action into 30 individual cuts.So I'm frustrated. A great action movie with an incredible cast that is pretty much ruined through nothing more than stylistic and technical incompetence. And why the heck did they show you-know-who in the preview trailer to totally destroy his wonderful cameo appearance!",6,20,40,13 August 2010
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg is Back - Not that He Ever Went Away
","It's easy to get caught up in the magnificent acting performances of this film's phenomenal international cast. Of course you expect Tom Hanks to put his usual Oscar-worthy skills on display, and he does in scene after scene. But everyone in the supporting cast is equally as memorable, not to mention Mark Rylance, who is one of the most talented actors many people may not recognize or even be familiar with. It's also easy to get caught up in the beautiful, period cinematography, locations and sets in Bridge of Spies. The look and feel of both early 1960's America plus the depressing starkness of East Berlin during the escalation of the Cold War are depicted perfectly.But what came through to me more than any of these individual pieces is the unsurpassed storytelling skills of Steven Spielberg. Not only does he get one of the best performances out of Hanks in his entire career, but his attention to detail and nuance is utterly amazing. When Hanks is confused, Spielberg makes sure you are as well. When he's feeling anxious or paranoid, the director makes you equally as apprehensive. But he does this with visual cues, glances, hints and a marvelous musical score.This is cinema at its purest and its best. Dialog is less important than the visuals, but the script is tight, crisp and taught. Nothing is wasted. In a season when there have been a great many outstanding films to hit the screen (Mr. Holmes, Black Mass, Everest) Bridge of Spies is a must-see for anyone who loves a well-told story that will make you wonder how two hours can fly by so quickly.",10,4,11,17 October 2015
Midsommar," Why is there a screenwriter credit?
",It looks like they just made this up as they went along. Totally random bits that have no meaning or connection. The actors probably thought they were making some weird parody and went along with it for the laughs. Total trash.,1,6,16,14 January 2020
The Happening," A New Low for M. Night Shyamalan and His Actors
","As I was watching 'The Happening' today I keep wondering to myself: 'Who keeps giving this guy money to make these horrible movies?' 'Why didn't I keep my promise NEVER to go see another M. Night Shyamalan movie on opening day?' 'How can anyone make a great actor like Mark Wahlberg look so foolish?' 'Didn't anyone working on this film actually watch it?' Shyamalan must have paid his cast and crew a fortune to work on this monstrosity and simply told them up front that he doesn't care what they think, doesn't want to hear any opinions or suggestions and to just keep their mouths shut. After all, he's a great auteur, no? Because Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed this film, I can only assume what I saw today is exactly what he wanted to put on the screen. It is incredibly bad. Most first-year film school students could do a better job of writing dialog and structuring a plot. And someone needs to teach Shyamalan about exposition in a dramatic work. Having characters pop into frame to explain what's going on is NOT good story-telling. And letting them go one for minutes at a time as they explain who they are, how they got there, what they've seen and what they are planning to do next is just plain amateur in the worst way.I can't even being to enumerate all of the things wrong with this film. But I'm not just being some film snob who expects high art from all of my cinematic experiences. I was in a theater in suburban Milwaukee on a Friday afternoon. It was about half full with people of all ages. I witnessed an elderly couple walk out after about 30 minutes. I heard snickers and moans from the back of the theater. And several times people laughed out loud - not because something amusing occurred on the screen, but because what the character just said or did was so outlandish that all you could do was laugh. Otherwise you would cry.The premise of the film is not a bad one. It has an ecological overtone that could have been developed into an insightful and thoughtful story. But instead, it basically ends up that the trees and plants are mad at us and want us to kill ourselves. No twists, no intelligent revelations. And absolutely no explanation as to why some people were spared while others succumbed. Even the strangely animated psychotic scientist interviewed on TV at the end of the film fails go give us any sort of sensible or satisfying resolution.When a movie is this bad, it's very difficult to write a review. Where do you start and what do you reference when everything deserves to be ripped apart? It's no wonder that Shyamalan and the distributor insisted everyone involved with the project be sworn to secrecy. It is now obvious to me that this had nothing to do with the plot or the unique 'twist' we all expect a Shyamalan movie to have at the end. It was because there is nothing good to say about it and if an actor dared tell people to go see the movie his credibility would be in serious jeopardy. Again, I can only believe Wahlberg got paid more money than he could say 'no' to - because he is too talented and too intelligent to get involved with this project otherwise.I'll end my comments with the most memorable, out-of-place and gratuitous lines from the film. The three lead characters are desperate to get out of town and a local plant nursery owner and his wife offer to give them a ride. But first they have to stop by their house to pick up a few things and say goodbye to their plants. At this point, the nursery owner turns and say, 'You like hot dogs? Hotdogs get a bad rap. They got a nice shape, are full of protein...' Of course this pays off a few minutes later when we see him eating a hot dog before heading off into a field where certain death awaits him and his group of travelers.What? I want my money and 91 minutes back.",2,4,11,13 June 2008
The Witch," Deceptive Previews and an Aggravating Film
","I went to see The Witch based on the intriguing previews, plus the high user and critic ratings on IMDb. What did anyone find the least bit redeeming in this wretched film?Based on the previews I was expecting a frightening, exciting, tense movie about, oh I don't know, a witch!?!? Instead I was subjected to 90 minutes of a family's extreme religious superstition tearing them apart. OK, that's not necessarily bad for subject matter, but since everyone speaks in different accents and variations of 17th century English (ye, thee, thou, whilst, etc.) at wildly varying volume levels, I probably missed a good 40-50% of what was said. But what upset me the most was how the film existed in the world of plausibility for the majority of the time and then suddenly shifted into fantasy and the supernatural. Far too many WTF moments that I would have to spoil to enumerate. But just when you think you are dealing with the effects of religious extremism and how it can poison a person's mind, suddenly you get slammed with images of pure folklore fantasy and all you can do is scratch your head and wonder what the heck is going on. It's been a long time since a film has made me want to walk out in disgust.I give The Witch two stars because of the acting performances. The cast had some horrible material to work with but they did a wonderful job of expressing their emotions, fears and doubts about each other's faith. Somehow they spoke the lines they were given effectively as well. In the end they couldn't rise above the material, though, including the fact that like so many movies today, the filmmakers had no idea how or when the story should come to an end.",2,53,120,21 February 2016
