The Blair Witch Project," One Damn good Thriller!! What an ending!!
","I am glad to see that the old-style horror flick is coming back, no jenifer love hewit! I am not even going to consider seeing scream 3. This movie draws you in and you feel like what you are whatching is real. The ending is so incredible and apropriate!! Don't expect jump in your seat scares but non-stop goosebump-lke scares which are far more long lasting. I would definatly recomend that a person be familiar with the stories about the Blair witch before seeing this although they do say them in the movie, just not everyone remebers them towards the end (the whole child murder thing), I had to remind my bro.",8,1,1,30 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I can't believe you guys, It was awsome!!
","This movie is an incredible achievment and gave me everything I hoped to see. I left the theater feeling much like I did after seeing a New Hope. It is very similar but we must remember that it is an entirely different movie. You people are too hard on it! Every actor played the scene well, Jar Jar was hilarious (his character is supposed to be annoying, there's room for character change in 2&3), I'm totally left hanging for the 2nd and 3rd episodes.The action scene were simply masterpice and the light saber duel......BEST FIGHT SCENE EVER! See this movie, don't listen to what the cookie-cutter critics and film noir/independent rejects are saying and just have F-U-N!! p.s. The Senator Palatine sub-plot is very interesting.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
A Bug's Life," Pixar makes great Movies!
","I saw 'A Bugs Life' and I can say that it is one of the most imaginative funny movies of the year. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. Kids will love the crazy characters and colorful scenes but I don't think they will appreciate the comedy like an adult will. Pixar also shows the academy award winning animation short, 'Geri's Game' in the beginning and it is also very funny. Go see it.",8,0,0,22 December 1998
