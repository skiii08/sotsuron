Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat,a hero of our time
","You either love or hate the fictional,Kazakhstani journalist Borat.I love him.For all this character's ignorance and prejudice,his major accomplishment is to reveal the ignorance and prejudice of others-he takes us on a scary journey across western 'civilization' where he's trying to make a 'movie-film' about the 'best country in the world',a.k.a the US,to show his fellow countrymen.The question is,who is really the most civilized/uncivilized?Or are all humans equally uncivilized,but in different ways? I admire the courage of Sacha Baron Cohen,I can imagine he stirs up many emotions,the negative are probably the most powerful.Borat is not just a laughing stock,his helpless attitude make the people he meet equally helpless,they can no longer pretend to be superior. Most of the people he meet,interview or come across one way or the other show an from-above,contemptuous attitude,trying to be charming while teaching this 'savage'(as they probably see him as)nice western manners. I laughed during the movie,but afterward I also felt slightly sick and even uneasy.Not because of Borat,he's not a real person,but because of all these 'nice','normal' people he has revealed.They represent a great deal of the western world,so we should all probably feel a bit ashamed on their behalf.",8,4,14,17 November 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Excellent adventure classic
","I must admit I have a soft spot for old-fashioned adventure movies,especially the classic good vs evil kind.And what movie could better represent that category than Raiders of the lost ark... This is the first,classic Indiana Jones adventure in which he gets an assignment to find the Ark of commandments itself,to prevent it from being taken into possession by the Nazis(this is supposed to be in 1936 and the superstitious dictator Hitler is crazy about the occult). A lost artifact,which may still be in the possession of his old mentor professor Ravenwood,will be essential in this quest so his first destination is Tibet,Ravenwood's last known resort.Ravenwood is however no longer alive,so he then travels to Egypt,accompanied by Ravenwood's (at first) somewhat reluctant daughter/Indy's previous crush Marion(Karen Allen).The Nazis have discovered Tanis,a lost Egyptian city where the Ark is believed to be buried...so there's naturally no time to lose.Well,I do like profound,philosophical movies that makes you think.But hey,who can resist a real,fantastic adventure every now and then? If you haven't already traveled with the excellent traveling companion Indy all over the globe,do it now!",8,0,0,9 October 2006
Cars," A future Disney classic
","I loved 'Cars',many kid's movies are just tedious for parents,so is not the case with 'Cars'.A solid two hours is a bit long for a kid to sit still though(I saw it with my three oldest,ages 8,7 and 4Â½)and they got a bit restless the last 20 minutes or so. Apart from that,they loved it too.Particularly the two oldest who are hardcore racing fans. 'Cars' is about a new,flashing rookie racing car named McQueen(the Steve reference is for parents probably;).On his way to California for a very important race he takes an involuntary detour to a town where time has stood still since the fifties,no one stops there anymore,and to him the inhabitants are just hillbillies.And what was a very reluctant stay becomes a new life experience for him,with new friends and new values.Winning isn't everything. The animation is stunning,it's almost incredible that it's all 'just animated'. I have only seen it with Swedish voice-overs(because of my kids),but I'd love to see the original version too. I appreciate the more adult references,it gives us parents an extra treat:) I found myself both having a tear in the corner of my eye and getting lost in the beautiful scenery more than once.I think there's not one kid out there who won't love 'Cars'!",8,0,0,2 September 2006
Caddyshack," A little gem...
","This is actually one of the funniest comedies I have ever watched,seemingly with no arty ambitions(which is quite a relief at times,especially when you feel low)at all and with plenty of 'low' humor,presented with warmth and heart.The cast makes this movie(the script could have been a disaster in the wrong hands and with the wrong actors)a true pleasure to watch.We get to know a young caddy named Danny with high ambitions to raise money for college one way or the other,but the true highlight is Bill Murray's somewhat dopey/crazy green keeper who spends most of his time trying to eradicate chipmunks from the golf course,with the persistence of a madman. Very early eighties in all aspects,but in a positive way. Well worth your time,especially on a gloomy day.",8,5,7,25 June 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Astounding
","effects for being this old,see this movie in a theater and not at home,that's my advice. If you're looking for an action sci-fi flick,this is not for you. The poetic nerve here is the strength of this future vision,where an expedition is sent to a place near Jupiter to explore the source of a monolith discovered on the moon. A similar one on earth was said to have made man evolve from the apes in the far past. Now the crew has technology to aid them,but technology seem to have its own mind and motives.HAL,the ship computer,seem to have become somewhat too human and start making his own decisions.His red all-seeing eye are watching the crew around the clock. In many ways this movie makes you wonder and ponder the role of technology,and what might happen if it one day may start making decisions of its own,without our consent. Do we really want computers with feelings and emotions?Really? The tripped ending was a slight disappointment though,it was too indefinite and drug-induced...",8,0,4,6 September 2006
Beetlejuice," Ghosts wants the living out...
","I love Burton's movies,being an ex-goth(still are on the inside)and all;)Beetlejuice is the story of a young couple(Davis and Baldwin)who moves into their dream home,a big white house on a hill overlooking a small town. However as luck would have it,they both die as their car slides off a bridge when they are on their way into town to buy some supplies. At first they don't realize they have passed.It takes a new family to move in,the somewhat neurotic Deetz's,before they completely face the fact... the Gothic daughter seem okay enough,but they still want the Deetz's out. Who would bet better suited for the task than the exorcist himself,Beetlejuice(Keaton)?Only,he's a ghost himself and he exorcises the living...I like this movie a lot,it's Burton-crazy and I have always felt a great sympathy both for the newly departed couple and the neurotic,misunderstood daughter(Ryder) who tries to become friends with the house-ghosts.An highly unusual plot,which I think any person with even the slightest dark sense of humor will enjoy.",7,0,1,12 August 2006
