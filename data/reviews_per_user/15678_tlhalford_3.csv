The Equalizer," Out of storyline
","I saw this on Sunday at Showcase cinemas. I enjoyed parts of the film, but to be honest a lot of the film could have been cut out. Robert has turned into a killer to try and get Teri her freedom, but she disappears for almost half of the film! While she is gone, Robert kills the whole off Teddy's gang, however Teddy doesn't feel the need to kill Robert, and they can even sit across a dinner table from each other and talk like nothing has happened. At first, you think the bad guy is Slavi, as he is the man mentioned most by Teri, but that's the twist, when he kills him very early on in the film, we realise there is someone bigger than him. Denzel Washington can be the perfect actor for any film, but I don't think this film was his best compared to Flight which I loved! A Walk Among The Tombstones was released around about the same time as The Equalizer, and there was no need to, as they are pretty much the same. They both have gory scenes with a lot of blood, and they are both after 1 person or gang. All action films have the same predictable story! It's the actors that make the film great, including Martin Csokas calm but deadly character, and an innocent Chloe Grace Moretz. There are a few comical lines that made me laugh, and the audience also found them amusing, and there are parts that could make you feel faint! My favourite part was the ending, when Robert finishes his mission in slow motion, in a rainy warehouse, with the soundtrack blaring in the credits (Eminem- Guts over fear ft. Sia) I did prefer Liam Neesons A Walk Among Tombstones, as it was a more believable story to follow. I would recommend this film to action film lovers, but what I will say is not to expect anything too special. Overall I rate the film 7/10, as I enjoyed the action packed parts, but believe it went of the story line slightly.",7,0,4,9 October 2014
Horrible Bosses," Need to see HB 2!
","I decided t watch this film, only because the trailer for the second film looks hilarious. Basically,3 high school best friends are always talking about how much they love their job, but hate their bosses(hence the title). All 3 of the men star in other comedy films, including 'This is where I leave you' which for me was a smash hit! So eventually, one of them come up with the idea of killing their own boss, which doesn't go well at first, so they decide to hire an assassin. But, that goes even worse, as he is not an assassin, and then they meet a guy who says he is an assassin, but turns out to be a piracy copier. The 3 men don't have the best of luck, until they decide to take it into their on hands, and kill someone else's boss, other than their own. For one of them, it goes to plan in a very random twist that got me laughing my head off. But not so much for the other two, instead, one boss is blackmailed, and the other is saved from death.To be honest with all of you, it's a very random storyline, but it's a perfect comedy, which my boyfriend and I loved! If you want to watch a comedy that includes action, sex and drama all in one, then this is the film you want to see. Now, I can't wait to see Horrible Bosses 2! Hope you all enjoy both of them!",8,0,1,4 December 2014
