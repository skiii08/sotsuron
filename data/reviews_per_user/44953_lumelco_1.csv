Catch Me If You Can," St George School Melgoza
","I like the film because it is similar to the true story but i would like to know if Frank got married and what happened with Brenda also what Happened with Carl's Life?St George School Yasu I was enjoying this film. Carl try to catch up Frank but he can't do easily. Also Frank pretended to be a lawyer, a pilot and a teacher,make some frauds and keep escaping These scenes are most exciting in this film. It reflects not only humor but also passion.St. George School Nelson Raul I think that the film was fine and very interesting. The FBI agent caught Frank and I like Frank's decision and the new type of life. Frank helped the FBI agent and he became a good person. The best part for me was the FBI agent attitude with Frank, many police agents must watch this film. Frank's father had a bad attitude to agree with his son life. Frank's mother has a bad decision her decision helped Frank to cheat a people. Thank you very much Nelson Raul",8,2,4,28 April 2006
