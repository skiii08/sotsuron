The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst movies ever
","Being the horror fan I am, I want to give my take on Blair Witch Project. Disregarding the low budget, Blair Witch Project is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The idea of having unknown and unschooled actors for a documentary type film, isn't a bad idea. But in this movie, they are so annoying that you are hoping something really bad will happen to them. I remember the tagline said something about this would be the scariest movie ever made, after I had seen it, I couldn't really grasp that statement. I think the only people scared of this move would probably be very young and afraid of the dark and woods.. A total waste of time.",1,2,4,27 April 2005
