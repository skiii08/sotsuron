Howl's Moving Castle," Moving
","Well, I saw this movie when it first came out with my current partner, near the beginning of our relationship. So, I'm biased.Yes, I love this movie.It's like a more grown-up version of Spirited Away. The characters are rounder and warmer and, if anything, more magical. The magic is richer and cleverer and darker and more compelling. The dream has burst into reality, the magic is not dreamy, but *awake*, wide awake and sizzling with wild delights, in the form of a castle that walks around on chicken legs with a fire-demon at its heart. It's every bit as good, the emotional tones are even more beautiful than in that other masterpiece of the unbridled childish imagination.My favourite scene is the flashback when Howl watches the falling star people fizzing across the sky to the high, clear, pale blue lake near his little house in the mountains, and catches one and starts talking to it. It lights up his face in the dark...You either love this sort of thing or you don't.And, better still, it has a *grown-up* fairy story, the story of a girl who must cast away her self-imposed prison of excessive common sense and dare to dream.Again the plot is meandering, but it's even less important in this than in Miyazaki's other movies. The last scene is a breath-taking and unashamedly primitive romantic confection. Just like Disney used to be...10 stars. 100 stars... 1,000 stars...",10,2,4,27 September 2006
The Ring," Mildly Unsettling
","Yeah.Kinda moody here and there, kinda liked the kid coming up out the well, liked the way she came out the TV. Nearly worked. Liked the flickery look of her, like she was made of TV. That was kinda cool.Liked the horse on the ferry, nearly worked with those worrying cellos thumping away a la 'Jaws'.But, um, its got that problem that movies have now, where everything's in the Modern Style, desaturated images, tastefully composed shots of grime and electric cables looking more like a still life in an art gallery than a scene from a movie, blurry shots of eeeevil Samara in the asylum, BEAUTIFULLY composed and tinted, making me think 'oooh how tasteful and elegant' not 'cripes, what a creepy little girl'. My poor brain won't do 'arrg scary' at the same time as it's doing 'oooo tasteful'. During that bit where they find her room in the barn with the cute little TV like something out of a spooooooky sort of Calvin and Hobbes strip (it had cutely angled little ariels like a friendly grasshopper) and the little carousel and her little bed all uniformly tinted in pale browns and faded sour creams I thought, how EVOCATIVE. How MYSTERIOUS. And how thoroughly FAKE LOOKING. Such a perfect, sweet little theatre set - it would have been beautiful on a stage but in the movie it just looks like something that would have been beautiful on a stage.If you over-stylise these things, they stop being scary and just become static, like images in a gallery. They're lovely to look at, but why not just make images and put them in a gallery? They'd work better and probably actually be scarier. It's fine to overdo the interior deco in a fantasy film or a comedy or a sci fi flick, but not a horror movie, horror movies have to be real, nail-scrapingy, eye-bulgingly real. Reality isn't tasteful or well-composed. Or cunningly tinted to look older than it is.Having said all that, the girl coming out the TV nearly worked, because it's supposed to be supernatural.Guys, horror movies have rules.Also, no, no, no, filmmakers, don't add pointless subplots about parents trying to reunite for the sake of their kid. It's a horror movie, not a chick flick.3 stars, all 3 for Samara coming out the well, which, had I been significantly younger and had seen fewer horror movies, would probably have been quite scary.",3,0,1,17 June 2008
Se7en," Pretty good, but a bit over-rated...
","It might be because I've seen a lot of films since it's release in 1995 that have borrowed heavily from its visual style, which was possibly very unusual at the time (I can't remember) but this didn't ring with me as strongly as it has with some people. It's very much a David Fincher with decay and desaturated colour tones everywhere, lots of grand, decaying buildings and a feeling of gloomy, low tech nostalgia sliding in at the sides, and that's very welcome, but it's not as gripping as some make out.It certainly isn't a *bad* film, by any stretch. The plot's well balanced, the characters nuanced and believable (except Brad Pitt who's such an annoying brat I can't see how anyone anywhere would hire him as a cop) and the dialogue is good enough (although really Morgan FReeman brings a real shine to it that Pitt can't match), with the exception of some slightly hammy bits.The main thing that seems to have gripped everybody is the serial killer's supposedly insanely clever twisted, creepy, dark, disturbing plan, but I don't really think it's as creepy as all that. Saw, a far less interesting film, was WAY creepier, although I suppose it borrowed heavily from Seven.Also, I don't really care much about how creepy serial killers are anyway, I think it's just a cheap titillation device.Where this film's most interesting is where Brad Pitt's character gets his come-uppance for being such an annoying little twerp. And even that feels a little bit cheap, there isn't a moment where he's on screen that he doesn't irritate, which may be the point, but it's a bit much to make an entire film about an evil serial killer just so you can give an imaginary jackass a slap in the face.But Morgan Freeman was good...",7,1,3,23 November 2006
Pitch Black," Pretty Good!
","Once you add up all the happy (or unhappy) coincidences needed to make the plot of this film work it falls over. But it pelts you along at such a pace that you don't notice! Excellent pop-corn scif-fi, intelligent enough to keep sciffy fans happy and enough action to please everyone else. Different look, too! And Vin Diesel is very good in this. I haven't seen anything else with him in it that I like, but here he is very much in his element.The characters are really perfectly written and portrayed, the special effects are in fact fairly cheaply done but but also very creatively, and the slightly moth-eaten-ness of everything actually contributes to ambiance of the movie.There's been talk about the physical laws being violated in the solar system this movie is portrayed in - there aren't any violations that I can see. The story is set on the moon of a ringed gas giant which is orbiting a star which is in a binary system with... another, smaller binary system. Binary systems are commonplace, as are gas giants with moons and suns with interesting orbital resonances leading to grand alignments and complex eclipses. Just because the orrery takes the planet as the fixed frame of reference (which is probably what you'd have to do anyway to represent such a system) doesn't mean any laws are being violated. In fact, the cosmology in this movie is really GOOD... OK... Enough cosmology...The monsters are great! Convincing, scary dumb beasties a bit like sharks and a bit like bats and a bit like snakes and a bit like pterodactyls...The plot collapses under scrutiny, but not through badly thought-through character motivation or twists that make no sense, nobody does anything *unbelievably* stupid, by which I mean everyone's behaviour is logically explicable and can be related to. It's the weight of all the coincidences that causes the collapse, but that's okay, the movie's exciting enough that you don't care.It probably doesn't carry repeat viewing, I'd guess...8 stars! 2 for Vin diesel, 1 for the sheer coolness of a story set on an interesting and physically possible solar system, 1 for the rest of the characters, all of whom are excellent, 1 for the fast and furious plot, 1 for the beasties and a whopping 2 for that lovely shot of the the suns going down behind the gas giant in the middle of the movie...WOW... that was pretty...",8,0,0,20 September 2006
Spirited Away," Beautiful
","I'm not really the sort of person who sits through a movie with a list of mental check-boxes that I need ticked before I can say I enjoyed it, or would give it a '10'. We all have these little checkboxes and are mostly unconscious of them while were watching a movie, but can become painfully conscious of them when the movie leaves them unticked (no plot... grrr NO tick in little box... patronising exposition... grrr, NO tick in little box) and a lot of people who need certain of these boxes ticked will be annoyed by Spirited Away. It's plot is meandering and 'join the dots' at best and its characters, when viewed objectively, are actually somewhat skewed, either too peculiar or too saccharine to relate to.But *I* don't care.I'm the sort of person who can forgive any number of flaws if there's anything in the movie resembling genuine imagination, particularly if it's used in a meaningful way. Sometimes only one sublimely imaginative moment will satisfy me and make the film something that I will love and treasure forever however bad the rest of it is. For this reason, I love the whole of, for example, 'The Dark Crystal', however dated it seems and stilted and wooden the dialogue, because it just DRIPs with dreamy originality.*Every single scene* in Spirited Away seems to throb with a unique magic, it's a continuous *string* of these sublimely imaginative moments. To me, it has exactly the timeless wonder of Alice in Wonderland. And, amazingly, because writing a new fairy story is always very difficult, on an inexplicable fairy-tale logic level, it all rings true, hangs together and makes sense! Everything in this movie seems at once alien yet hauntingly familiar, like a particularly vivid and startlingly colourful dream. I felt, as the story unfolded, as if I had already seen it and loved it when I was a very small child, and had simply forgotten it.SPOILERS My favourite sequences are: 1. Just after Chihiro and her parents walk through the archway into the sun-drenched Field of Smiling Stones and the music seems to lift off the ground like a dandelion seed in a soft breeze. I have spent many happy days on islands of the coast of Scotland in the summer that felt just like that, awake yet dreaming, bright and beautiful.2. The water train sequence, which was strange and delightful. (That house on the tiny bit of land not much bigger than the house itself reminds me so *very* strongly of places I visited as a child on holiday in Scotland that I can hardly help but love it.)3. The Cleansing of the River God, which was wonderful! SPOILERS END One warning, this movie might be frightening for very small children. My 5 year old nephew found it a bit too spooky in places (but loved it), even though he laughed all the way through even the scariest bits of 'Twilight Zone The Movie'...Not *really* a kids movie, a movie for the kid inside adults...",10,2,3,21 September 2006
Stardust," Magnificent!
","A feast of fun! I've read the illustrated novel, and while it was one of Gaiman's better excursions into the genre of fantasy, it wasn't as good as this movie adaptation.I was particularly taken by the acting and characterisation. Lamia in particular was a PROPER fantasy villain, the likes of which hasn't graced our screens for quite some time. Her 'counterproductive beauty routine' was hysterically funny, but she was still scary, in fact she got scarier and scarier as the movie progressed.The ghosts of the Stormhold Clan were hilarious, Robert De Niro delivers a performance that should steal the movie but the rest of the movie's so good it *just* gets away from him, I even ended up liking snooty Victoria and Humphrey! All of the characters were likable, even the nastiest of the witches.The thing I like best about this movie is the way they handled the magic. There's always a sense that it costs something, that it has rules. And there's magic happening all over the place, but it never really dominates or interferes with the movie, it just spices it up beautifully! A romp! I felt 10 years old again!",10,3,5,26 August 2007
Children of Men," Well, that was a laugh.
","I'm not rating this as I can't really be honest. It's like 'Brazil' except not funny, it's 'Threads' for the post-Cold War generation.It's horrible. It's like 'War of the Worlds' done by a Brit. We are spared nothing. It's one long, slow slide into despair and chaos.The most affecting scene for me were the torture chambers at the refugee camps with people having their clothes stripped off in lines at gun point. The camera makes a long, slow point in this sequence, hovering first over men kneeling with the arms clasped behind their heads, then people tied up in cages, then rows of people being marched around in circles, then rows of naked bodies. None of it's done with slick sci-fi technology, it's just the same old techniques on display across the news everywhere these days.Nothing works properly in this society. Even the getaway car won't start. The terrorists motives are entirely understandable but they are so totally wrong-headed in everything they do that they're doomed from the outset.SPOILER The minute Jasper walked on-screen I knew he was completely doomed. 'GET OUT OF THE MOVIE!' I wanted to yell at him. 'YOU'RE A HIPPY IN A FASCIST POLICE STATE!' There is doom and failure and death and weeping by the bucketload in this movie. From the soul-deadening opening sequence through the art collector's warped and twisted little empire to the Rape of Bexhill, there is not one moment of lightness or hope.DOOM. BLEAKNESS. HOPELESSNESS. DESPAIR...Ahem.It's all a bit... *self-absorbed*...So, I'm not really sure how to rate it, because although it's a very horrible and convincing projection of *present day* society's fears onto the future (which is what much of science fiction often is rather than a prediction of the future), I don't think it's *convincing* because there's any real likelihood that that's what the REAL future's going to be like. I think it's convincing because it's currently extraordinarily fashionable to wallow and the wallowers are easily convinced of a sort of indefinable inevitability. Especially if you're fiscally comfortable.Personally, I disapprove of this wallowing, and the entire film's awash with it. So, although as an exercise in stylish, grey-minded, desaturation-filtered wallowing it deserves the full '10', as a *film*... I can't say it's all that good.This film has many serious axes to grind, and worthy axes they are too and long due a sharpening...but I have a nasty feeling the film-maker doesn't know which end of an axe is supposed to be the sharp one...",Null,3,11,9 October 2006
Event Horizon," Not bad...
","7 stars.I'd give it an 8, but it's not QUITE an 8. 7.8, say.The design is good, REALLY good, unique and compelling. They manage to make the ship look beastly creepy. It's a bit OTT and obvious, but V effective...The acting is really surprisingly good. The script ISN'T that good, but is made more than palatable by excellent interpretation by Sam Neill and most of the rest of the cast except Lawrence Fishburne, who spoils his part sufficiently to bring this film down from a '9'.(I simply can't understand why people keep casting Fishburne in Sci fi or Fantasy films. He obviously despises the genre...) The premise is a Hellraiser rip-off, but sufficiently different to make the new angle work in surprising ways.Sam Neill really pulls this movie back out of Fishburne's clutches and away from the brink of turkeydom several times and *then* his gravitas slingshots it into well-deserved cult status...Good last shot, too...",7,0,2,14 October 2006
Alice in Wonderland," Jabberwocky is a PARODY of heroic epics and you dolts took it SERIOUSLY.
","You dolts took a meandering, plot less masterpiece and turned it in all seriousness into a soul-less CGI dirge with the same plot that it's source was LAUGHING AT.The Jabberwock is not a dragon. The Jabberwock is the IDEA of a dragon. It wears spats and a waistcoat you DOLTS.The Queen of Hearts never ACTUALLY chops anyone's head off, the Gryphon SAYS SO. There is nothing oppressive or dangerous in Wonderland. Wonderland doesn't make enough SENSE for anything to be dangerous.Where WAS the Gryphon? Where was the Mock Turtle? Where was Bill the Newt? Where was the trial of the Knave of Hearts? Come to that, where were the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse? The Dormouse is a sleepy fat thing that likes treacle, not Reepicheep.Where was the Duchess? Where was the Duchess's cook? Why does everybody make such a big deal out of the Cheshire Cat and the Caterpillar? They're among the least significant characters in the book!Who's this bandersnatch? What's the Jabberwock doing in it at ALL? The Jabberwock's a work of fiction even on the other side of the looking glass!What's all this faux-sinister creeping about with wounds and murky skies and burning buildings and severed heads? You DOLTS. Don't you remember the ending? The oppressive queen, the insulting know-it-all tea-party guests, the bewildering fluctuation in one's own sense of self-importance almost like growing and shrinking, the unhelpful people, the stupid people, the bad-tempered people, yes, and even the hero waving his little magic sword at the scary dragon in a waistcoat and spats, what does Alice say to them? 'Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards!' Your story-telling has regressed to the shuffling of tropes that children were laughing at over a century ago.Did you even READ the book?",1,126,203,10 March 2010
Up," Up there with the rest of the Pixar masterpieces
","There's a difference between Pixar and most of today's movie studios that makes it stick out like a rose in a sea of sore thumbs. The difference is that the first thing they do their best to get right is the story and the first thing they do to get that right is to find the story's heart. There are a lot of clever movies, scary movies, exciting movies, silly movies and just plain bad movies out there released year after year, but Pixar goes for the heart every time and there's just no replacement for movies that want to speak to people's hearts.The opening sequence in this movie is a series of images that another film-maker might have done as a series of flashbacks. It's a simple story of two people who have found that they must be near one another to be happy - true love. Where is true love in the other stories pumped out like mortar shells from the industry's product-connection and tie-in merchandise addled belly? It's rare these days. Sex, sure, flirtation, mawkish sentimentality, but love? 100 million stars for that sequence alone.The rest of it had me howling with laughter, as usual they just don't seem to be able to put a foot wrong. Could Pixar be the greatest movie studio of all time?",Null,1,3,11 October 2009
War of the Worlds," Good!
","Yes, very good.SPOILERGASM Some folk have complained about the fact that the some electronic devices stopped working and some didn't. This is exactly what would happen if the cause of the electronic failures was that well-understood scientific phenomenon (and often pondered candidate as a basis for weaponry), *a massive electromagnetic pulse*, which looks reasonable from all that lightning. EMPs only affect devices that are *already switched on* (This would include the entire power grid). Anything switched off would work fine *after* the pulse.Also there have been mutterings about the aliens planning it for millions of years. Well, who's to suppose the aliens were planning an *invasion*? A colonisation is certainly at least one of their goals, but it's quite possible that they had no idea that humans were on Earth at all! This dovetails nicely with the alien bods looking in Tim Robbin's basement scritching their heads over all his basement stuff.For all we know, cows blood would have been just as good...There's also been annoyance that certain characters turn out not to have perished, well, I think Spielberg's allowed ONE of these given how much hell he's been giving everybody throughout the entire movie.POST SPOILER CIGARETTE...Anyway, all that stuff aside, it's all very affecting. The effects are excellent and thankfully the CGI doesn't try any of those impossible POVs that have been plaguing Hollywood. It's all done from ground level, only one annoyingly disorientating swooping sequence. This brings about a very tight atmosphere, very tense. The war machines are well-designed, clearly alien without being hokey, but they still look and sound like machines. The harvesting / fertilising sequences are *bloody scary*.The plot's a bit unidirectional. It reminds of Grant Morrison's writing in places, when Morrison's at his most unidirectional he tends to up the scale of whatever's going on when he needs a change, in this movie Spielberg's direction is similarly one-track but when he needs something to change he just drops the protagonists in it even deeper. I'm a sucker for this trick.Not *ten* stars, because he didn't go the whole hog. He could very easily have done even worse things to those protagonists, or even some of the extras, that would be more like a proper war laid bare, and he held back. He should have gone the whole hog.Having said that, the feeling of the mad-eyed hopelessness faced by an utterly overwhelmed invaded country he projected onto that screen was shockingly clear and, perhaps, almost, sobering.A feat of the imagination...",9,1,3,22 September 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Full marks, Mr Downey Jr!
","MAGNIFICENT.This is a hugely enjoyable adaption of Sherlock Holmes. Adaptations depart from their originals in movies through necessity - movies don't work like prose so new elements have to be introduced and ineffective ones removed, simple as that. Adaptations should be assessed on their own merits. A good rule of thumb in a re-imagining of an old story is to see how people who don't know the original react and my friend who didn't know much about Holmes thought this film was excellent.It's a funny movie! Most of the movie's driven by its humour and most of the humour comes from Holmes being wonderfully obnoxious.Many complaints will be/have been made regarding the new Holmes/Watson dynamic - I think it's hilarious. What would be the point of just re-filming the Brett take? The whole point of doing the same stories/characters again is to find different things and see if they work. I say this version of Holmes works! In fact...I'm really REALLY impressed with RDJ's and Guy Ritchie's take on Holmes - an OCD maniac with manipulative tendencies, impatient to the point of despair with what he must see as the slowness of those surrounding him, incapable of switching off his brain, never still. RDJ has made a Holmes that is frankly superhuman, not merely an elegant, witty and superbly disciplined intellectual, but some kind of freak that just can't stop analysing everything around him. It's actually more faithful to Conan Doyle's vision than a lot of people are going to give it credit for.And I'm ANNOYED with people complaining about the extra weight placed on fisticuffs in this movie - Guy Ritchie goes entirely out of his way to include a scene wherein Holmes wins his fight hands down not with superior brawn but with superior *knowledge*. And then has the sense to balance this with that huge French guy later in the movie to show that even Holmes isn't indestructible. The physical violence isn't predictable in this movie, it matters and adds weight and power to the story. It simply isn't comparable to the silly Matrix-styleeee fight scenes that have plagued the movie industry of late! AND they had Irene Adler. And they mentioned Mycroft. AND a certain someone else 'appeared' who was portrayed very cleverly, oh yes, and oh YES, Mr Ritchie, if THAT'S what he's going to be like, I WILL come to watch your sequel! There's just one quibble. RDJ's Holmes was a teeny bit too cool for Mark Strong's Blackwood to confront convincingly. But never mind. with luck, Guy Ritchie will ramp up the baddie a notch or two in the next instalment... wink, wink, Mr Ritchie...",10,3,6,9 January 2010
WALL·E," We all know Pixar are incapable of making bad movies, but THIS movie has taken them to a new level.
","WALL-E was perfect.Of course it was perfect, it's a Pixar flick! ALL Pixar flicks are perfect. They've never once even made a film that's a flawed masterpiece. They don't DO flaws.The design is fantastic. The most stunning thing is the way the robots are animated. Pixar have reached a new level in minimalism here, they hit some brilliant new peak in using the least necessary cue to signal emotion. My favourite robot is halfway through the movie. It's not so much a robot as some sort of processing unit, processing *what*, I don't know. It's attached to the wall, pushing buttons slowly and deliberately. All it has to express emotion is one big sphere for an eye and a couple of robotic arms that can barely move outside a very small and obviously highly ordered and... well, I suppose 'prescriptive' way.It looks bored. It looks SO. BORED.WALL-E waves at it. It looks at him slowly and at it's own 'hand', which it wiggles. 'Oh', it thinks. Later on in the movie, as WALL-E is passing, it waves back, still bored, but just a teeny bit less so.That whole sequence for me is the best bit of the movie in terms of Pixar's artistry. I'm really glad they did it, because it goes right back to the roots of Pixar. Remember the short with the anglepoise lamps? Pixar have been showing for years that they can make the simplest of inanimate objects have dreams, adventures, failures and victories as convincingly as any other character. Robots was an obvious choice for them. I'm surprised they didn't do this movie earlier.Oh, and they've taken a leaf or two out of Studio Ghibli's book in some areas. They usually have 'out-takes' at the end but this time there's a Ghibliesque confection that really made the point of the movie, for me.Brilliance.",10,5,10,21 July 2008
Beowulf," The film that should have been called 'Dennis', or something...
","...NOT 'Beowulf', because it rogers the very concept of the epic poem Beowulf up the arse. Quite deliberately, too. It's a razor-sharp side-swipe at heroism itself, this tale, and bears a peculiar and quite knowing relation to the source material. It's up there with Starship Troopers. I think a lot of people have missed this.Essentially this is the story of what the film-makers would like us to imagine is the REAL Beowulf. We're to believe that the real reason we're left with the epic as it is now is because that's just what stories do over time. This is clearly signalled during the film, in particular during the sequence where Beowulf's exploits are performed for him in miniature by the dwarfs. This movie is a calculated, grim-eyed stab at the original's heart. Whether this is a good or bad thing I will leave to others to decide, but make no mistake, the re-write was in no way an *arbitrary* remix of the source material, as some seem to think.And therein lies the pity. A lot of careful effort's gone into making the story good. As an anti-hero's story, it's really bloody good. Beowulf starts out being a hyper-heroic cock and then becomes a good deal more human as the story progresses. Real, fleshy, palpable, flawed. He screws up. And then he redeems himself! And becomes a much more potent hero figure in the process! A hero whose true struggle, the hardest, most unforgiving one, will never truly be known as the unimaginative, bloodthirsty fools he shares the hall with won't tolerate any of his real feelings. This is much meatier stuff in terms of story-telling than the original. People will be angry with me for saying so, but it's true.UNFORTUNATELY, this very good story has been tainted with the word 'BEOWULF', the title of another story, also a very good story, but *quite different* in terms of theme, and I think this movie would be doing a lot better for itself in the IMDb tables if it was called... ummm... 'Simon'. Or something.Cos, it's a very good story, I think.I ended up liking Beowulf after at first thinking he was really a bit of a thick twit. I liked Grendel's mother from the start and now think she's one of the most interesting characters I've seen on screen this year, maybe in the last five years. Gravitas and guile, oh yes. And Grendel was brilliant, a truly hideous accident, a price paid, a warning, the personification of *dreadful consequence*. And everyone, really, all the actors did brilliantly, the script and acting and plot and effects and mis-en-scene were superb! Also, I really REALLY like the ending. It was a really strong, simple, unexpected ending that sent delightful shivers up my spine, cinematic shivers the like of which I rarely feel these days. Well done, Mr Gaiman! I imagine quite a few people will be cursing you heftily, I personally think you've done rather well... although, after making that strong, clean story, you should just have called it: 'Jonathan'. Or something. I know you like to be clever, but really, it would have been even better.3D stuff was good, too! Not in your face at all. Well, apart from the odd tentacle.Pity about the motion capture, though. Ick. Would have been 10 otherwise.Oh, yeah, and the stiletto feet were daft. Don't do that again.But that sequence where Grendel's mother sings over his corpse and starts going nuts... That was MENTAL. Do THAT again.Nine shiny, watery, fiery, fate-filled stars...",9,3,6,11 December 2007
Cube," NO. RAISE SHIELDS. This is Meaningless Gibberish.
","NO. This is NOT a cerebral film. It's a 'cerebral-y' film, like 'science fictiony' films, which are *not* science fiction.Up there (or down there) with Mission to Mars, this pseudo-intellectual tripe is a *poor* excuse for a philosoflick. I am *displeased* with this film, its teenaged cynicism and its makers.It's an interesting idea made dull by spattering it with gore, scary 'freak-out' scenes and tedious confrontations that reveal nothing and simply bore. Also, the dialogue is appalling. The acting's pretty film-studentish, too. 'B-side' character development. Stuffing 6 characters (cubes have 6 sides, folks! OOOOO) into a box and shaking them to see what happens...NOTHING. Nothing happens. They get bored and annoyed and start hacking lumps out of each other.Yeah, I work in an office, too, buddy. I know that's what happens, and it's boring. I don't want to watch a movie about it.An exercise in futility...1 star for the pro-intellectual rant by the maths student at the stupid guy who thinks shouting at people louder will get him what he wants.
