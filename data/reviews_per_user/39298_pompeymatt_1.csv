Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent
","Haven't been to the cinema in a long time, so decided to treat the missus with some Orange Wednesday tickets. Overall I thought it was an immense film, kept me watching and thinking all the way through, with a great twist at the end. Very clever and cool script. I thought it had an essence of Tarrantino about it. Great acting by Willis, Freeman got his usual support role down to a tee and Hartnett, I thought, was superb. Lucy Liu also fitted in perfectly, very cute and perfect for the role of Lyndsey. Only flaw I could see would be the relationship between Goodcat and Henry/Slevin. I couldn't understand why he wasn't scared in the slightest, instead just said 'I wanna go home', after being abducted and having a gun pointed in his face. Other that amazing, clever, cool film.Well worth a watch.. 9/10 for me.",9,2,9,15 March 2006
