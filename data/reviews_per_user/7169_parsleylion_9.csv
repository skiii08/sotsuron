Kill Bill: Vol. 2," critical response to self-indulgence
","There's a lot of fat in these movies Kill bill vol.1 and vol.2 that is too much narrative explanation, just cut to the chase Mr. Tarantino please! the action is great, the violence is unnecessary, the story clich√©d and spread too thin to make this 2 1/2 hour film worth bothering with. It was geeky self-indulgence. I watched the Maltese Falcon just before now there's a master piece, short, to the point, well acted and not a flatulent moment in the script unlike with Kill Bill which is just stupid in comparison. There's no mystery, no subtlety, no intelligence, no charm and no cool. The whole premise seemed to come from that parody TV pilot in Pulp Fiction about fox force five except this time the foxes are snakes etc etc. so to sum up this film has a story that is way too thin, the film is way too long but the action is really good. This is a B movie with A action far from a classic its made for TV parody material with little to warm to in it, just sass from an ugly American. Pai Mei would not be happy at all. Thank me I never paid to see this gaudy flick.",6,0,1,7 January 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," swashbuckling excellent pirate movie
","a witty script sees Depp steal the show as Captain Jack Sparrow in a role whose origins might have an interesting story to be told. The film is cliche stuff with the men witty, backstabbing, dishonourable rogues and the women suiting themselves, slapping men about, changing their minds without rhyme or reason and everyone living happily ever after. Pure fantasy, see it but don't believe it.",8,0,2,29 November 2003
Seabiscuit," a film about a horse ? called Teabiscuit !!
","How did they pitch this film to the producers ? or was it a mad drunken producers convention that ran into the Race horse trainers convention in the other bar! Seabiscuit is about a race horse and a jockey and a trainer and an owner who all have a story of struggle to overcome some life crisis in order to excel at what they do. Well told by accomplished writer and director Gary Ross with a fine cast of Cooper, Bridges and Maguire in no particular order each contributing a piece, a bit slow, a bit inevitable, a bit didactic with all those narrator talking over pictures of the Depression Era - now I wonder what that was about ? obviously not didactic enough! Anyway the Marx brothers made a tribute film at the end of the 1930's called 'a day at the races' and the horse featured was a certain Teabiscuit. Two very different approaches, 2 very different films to the same theme. I know which one I'll remember. So what do I think of Seabiscuit the film; in the words of Groucho ehem sorry! Doctor Hugo Z.

City of God," director in overdrive tells familiar story of poverty = a really awful existence
","City of God is about a district in Rio or some Brazilian city where poverty is rife and known as the city of god. Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film  but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means? If this goes on in Brazil and Ireland why not everywhere in which case ....",6,7,15,4 March 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," some thoughts strung together on ESOTSM late in the day
","I found this movie told a typical movieland story that is one of romance in an unusual, and like most Charlie Kaufman screenplays, thought provoking way. The movie made me feel good afterwards and while it's not airtight in its logic it has a few 'and then what happened' kind of moments where they are needed. Having said that it is a bit on the slow side, the characters are just alright and the scenarios are interesting but not really explored in a truly funny belly laugh kind of way or a 'hey thats something I never thought of' or thats a really unusual perspective. Having said that it is fairly inventive and convoluted enough to make most cave men and women leave scratching their heads though I don't think movies should be made for the dumbest mind on the planet so I couldn't care less if my fellow trogledytes get it or not. I would like to see Kaufman's ideas put together with a funny writers gags and routines now that would make a fine movie. If there is supposed to be something funny in ESOTSM it didn't register for me. Having said that it was good and it is worth a viewing.",8,0,2,13 October 2004
The Last Samurai," praise for a good film
","About time there was a return to the great traditional values of film making of yesteryear in such movies like Dances with Wolves, Little Big Man, the Searchers, the Mission, Laurence of Arabia, where cultures collide, so is The Last Samurai a great movie. A brilliant production that sets the world of movies back on track while most action films and rom-coms make a void, this film fills it. Well made, excellent photography, a brilliant cast, good music, a huge historical story for Japan and the context of rebellion and the state, a great individual story for Tom Cruises character in gaining a sense of worth, a director on the top of his form in Ed Zwick, a action filled idea filled movie:  thoroughly entertaining.",10,1,2,8 May 2004
Enemy at the Gates," well acted mish mash history drama
","I didn't come away from this movie feeling it was a complete waste of time but it was a waste of resources, $90million worth on sets and costumes and authenticity for a basically theatrical production. All the actors put in good performances particularly ed harris. The film basically never gets to grips with its material or the setting. Are we grateful to the russians for saving us from fascism and being utterly cruel and heartless in the process or should we revile them as they were in the cold war ? This is not a dilemma the film answers but just raises over and over while pointing out these are all people who love and hate and are weak and strong and they are in a war, apart from that the war could be anywhere. Lack of vision is what i'm talking about. For example the film actually opens to tell how far the 'german jackboot' has put its heel into Europes back, well so what if you were unaware of a war in Russia or a place called Stalingrad in history this piece of information is next to useless to citizens of 2001. It is clumsy and at best school room history. Then theres the whole issue of the central character and his conscience over killing so many for whatever cause. Little effort is made to see inside the characters beyond some minor lines about the obvious side of killing for example Zaitsev explains to a would be sniper that these are real people they are killing but he could be talking about buying cucumbers at the supermarket for all his zeal in the task. The script is poor and does no service for a new europe seeking truths in the past for all that the film is just another technical production success with a well acted drama element not untypical of a tv show like wings of war.",5,0,1,18 March 2001
Bruce Almighty," amusing comedy from elastic-face carrey with his own hair for once
","I gave this a 7 out of 10 for it's useful comment on what people use god for that is to get what they want, whether that's cynical or realistic a view is questionable but it's an honest appraisal by the writers. However I only scored the film a 6 because I'd seen most of the funny visuals in the film's trailer but didn't find this a spoiler unusually so much as to find Carrey's character dislikeable, being so self-centred but what a mope his girlfriend is. She didn't communicate well with the Carrey character. That aside this film has heart which is rare though the characters are an unsympathetic lot, who treat each other badly rather than support each other.  A dreadful view of humanity from that standpoint. So to sum up the film makers work :) great theology lousy psychology.",6,0,1,6 December 2003
Gladiator," Epic tale of power struggle in Rome set c.180 AD
","The opening scene of gladiator is a telling moment in the movie. General Maximus is thinking of being home on his farm with his family. This thought is captured in the picture of Maximus running his hand through ears of wheat while standing in a field planted with that crop. The scene cuts to Maximus in a forest in Germania on the eve of a battle, for a moment he sees and contemplates a robin as if with a friend, this is man of interesting qualities. What follows is a bloody battle sequence in which Maximus kills and maims and is nearly killed in turn. Life for Maximus is brutal, cruel and dark and yet we have seen he is not. Who is this character?Enter the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Richard Harris on a good days work, to congratulate Maximus. Cometh also the emperors son, Commodus and daughter, Drusilla, effectively the royal family, and a retinue of Roman politicians. How does Maximus deal with the political intrigues of a great empire, he fights wars is the answer so he doesn't need to. But now he is placed in a position where he must take sides. He becomes a victim of intrigue and ends up a slave, a gladiator living with the possibility of death, daily.Gladiator is the story of the intrigues of Rome, of Maximus' fight for revenge and how one man can defy an empire. Spectacular in its settings, with the city of Rome and it's Colliseum recreated with computer graphics as a backdrop, Gladiator is big screen cinema. The stunning images of director Ridley Scott capture a gritty and harsh time while displaying the beautiful light and colours this director is renowned for. Incorporating bloody battle scenes set to the equally impressive musical score done by the experienced Hans Zimmer and enchanting music of Lisa Gerrard, this movie is the work of a good team who know how to show the talents of their craft.Coming in at just on two and a half hours in length, Gladiator is the tale of slave versus master, of a spirited man versus a man twisted by power into a hateful tyrant, of worthy leadership against fearful controlling ambition. It is a film of great drama, with spectacular set piece battle scenes interspersed with intelligent dialogue and interesting and plausible characters. It is not necessary to undergo a crash course in Roman history to appreciate the story, which is heavily dramatised and largely fictitious, though the impact of the civilisation of the time needs to be appreciated if the movie is to suitably interest you.",8,0,0,28 March 2001
