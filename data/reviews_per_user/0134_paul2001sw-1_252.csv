The Blair Witch Project," If you go down to the woods today...
","A real horror film is always primarily about the psychology of fear, which leaves the movie maker with one key decision: how much to show, and how much to leave only in the mind.  'The Blair Witch Project' exists as the video diaries of some self-obsessed film-makers, making a film about themselves investigating the legend of a local witch.  As well as being an interesting experiment in narrative legitimacy, it also provides a novel solution to the aforementioned dilemma: we see exactly what the characters see for themselves.  It's convincingly done, and truly spine-chilling.  The 'heroes' are annoying American brats, but as their plight deepens, one is taken with the sense that they're going to die.  The result is harrowing, and more resembles the BBC's story of nuclear winter, 'Threads', than any conventional horror film.  Not exactly light entertainment, but genuinely good nonetheless.",10,2,3,28 October 2003
The King's Speech," Easy to watch, but devoid of social commentary
","Supposedly one of the best films of 2011, 'The King's Speech' is a sad reflection of our times if it is indeed unbettered in a year. It's not an awful film by any means: the story of a man (who happens to be the King) slowly learning to overcome his personal fears. But the basic story is utterly generic, and while there's some entertainment value from observing such a tale in an unlikely context (in this case, a royal one), the film contains only the faintest of social commentary; if you expect a serious examination of the abdication crisis, Edward VI's alleged Nazi sympathies, observations how a 20th century country can claim to be a democracy while led by an unelected king, or even a revisionist portrait of Wallis Simpson, you'll be disappointed; instead, this is very gentle drama about a monarchy which may be a little up itself but is unquestionably a good thing. As for historical precision, the notion that the King would come out of a radio broadcast to be greeted by a delegation of the prime minister, the Minister of the Admiralty (Churchill), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, is not so much inaccurate (forgiveable in a drama) but ludicrous and obvious at the same time. For some reason, this film struck a chord with many in the population in 2011; watch it (at the end of the year) for an insight into royal wedding fever, but don't expect any insight into the London riots.",6,3,8,3 January 2012
Saturday Night Fever," Saturday Night Sharking
","The career of John Travolta has had many ups and downs, but 'Saturday Night Fever'as where it really took off for the first time. The film is many things: a portrait of archetypal young people growing up under the influence of music (not unlike 'American Graffiti'); the story of a dance competition (like the later 'Simply Ballroom', although without that movie's wild comedy); and a portrait of New York's Italian community in the 1970s. One of the delights of this film is that Travolta's character is supposed to be cool, according to the standards of the time; but certain details now seem very dated, and one of the scenes set in a supposedly trendy club actually appears to demonstrate a form of line-dancing! There are subtleties here perhaps unexpected in a mainstream film, especially in the way the attitude of the male protagonists is at first apparently celebrated, but gradually revealed as atrociously misogynist; our attitude shifts with Travolta's, as his character grows up. As a pure dance movie, 'Simply Ballroom' is far more entertaining; but the edge of social, and human, realism raises this movie above the average modern Hollywood hit.",6,1,2,26 September 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Will someone kill Quentin now, please?
","OK, I don't really want Quentin Tarantino to be killed - actually, I am a big fan of his earlier films. But the 'Kill Bill' films are not in their league, all style and no substance. Volume 1 at least had a fast pace, its innovations coming quick and fast; but Volume 2 of this over-long project seems to add nothing new except for a layer of emotional interpretation that its grotesque, cartoonish characters can scarcely sustain. Volume 1 pastiched a huge range of different styles of film; Volume 2, at times, appears simply as a pastiche of a bad movie (and very hard to distinguish from a genuinely bad film to boot). Yet I can't help but feel that within these two movies (originally conceived as one very long film) there's a highly original shorter film that should have been made. When the saga ends with a credits sequence in which Tarantino appears to pay homage to himself, one can't help but wonder whether even the most talented of individuals don't sometimes benefit when someone else has the final cut.",4,6,10,5 July 2007
Vertigo," No towering achievement
","Alfred Hitchcock has a reputation as one of the outstanding film-makers of his era; but to a modern viewer, 'Vertigo' disappoints. The plotting is as torturous as any modern thriller, but the 1950 production values continually let it down: one grows tired of out-of-doors scenes transparently shot in the studio (and even the scenes actually shot on location are curiously devoid of passers-by), there's a very clumsy (though admittedly innovative) dream sequence, even the fact that the two leads are unable to even kiss each other properly starts to grate after a while. This might suggest that Hitchcock's only failing with this movie was over-ambition, but unfortunately, it isn't so: for he also fails to get decent performances from his leading actors, stiff-as-a-board Jimmy Stweart and icy Kim Novak (a typical Hitchcock blonde) generate absolutely no on-screen chemistry. And both have complex roles to play: one of them undergoes a kind of nervous breakdown, while the other simulates the same thing; but neither can play their roles with sufficient depth to make this story work as psychological melodrama. There is one interesting female character - played by Barbara Bel Geddes - but she is mysteriously written out half way though for no good reason. Compare the performances in this movie to those being put in by the likes of Marlon Brando or Orson Welles at the same period in time, and one has to pass harsh judgement. There are still a few interesting details: it's amazing how little dialogue Hitchcock dares get away with, and the very bleak ending is surprising for a mainstream film. But it's impossible to invest any emotional feeling in the story; and that's surprising, given Hitchcock's towering legend.",3,22,37,23 March 2006
Black Swan," Surprisingly camp
","Darren Aronofsky's film 'Black Swan' tells the story of a ballet dancer driven to madness by her paranoid fears of her fellow cast members and the challenge of expressing two sides of her own personality in an important double role. I'm no expert on ballet, but to me one problem of this film is that Natalie Portman so palpably conveys her growing discomfort in the role that she doesn't seem credible as the lead; the sense to which she appears ill-at-ease would surely lead to any director casting someone else in her stead. I also found the character is closed to the audience; the film didn't do enough to make me care about her. The final twist is clever but camp; but for a realistic portrait of the pressures of being a professional performer, look elsewhere.",6,1,1,9 February 2014
The New World," Dances with sheep
","Terrence Malick has made a handful of loose, impressionist films over four decades; 'The New World' is perhaps his most impressionistic yet, but also his most unsatisfactory. It tells the story of Pocohantas, the native American who married an early settler; as in some other tellings of the same tale, he imagines an earlier, competing relationship with the first settler who met and described her. The film attempts to give a flavour of the difficult, confused times faced by settlers and natives which provided the political, social and military backdrop to Pocahantas ultimately being offered to the white man as hostage for the indigenous people's safety. It certainly succeeds in conveying the confusion, because Mallick seems to wilfully disregard every convention of movie storytelling, preferring to give us disjointed scenes from his characters' lives instead of trying to fuse them into a coherent narrative. While one appreciates his desire not to make life appear more linear than it is, the desire for narrative is a natural human one, not just in film audiences but also in people living their own lives; we find stories amid the chaos to make sense of ourselves, and Mallick's failure to do so on behalf of his characters is frustrating. As a love triangle, it doesn't work either, because the two men she falls for are (compared with everyone else in the story) uninterestingly similar; and I never really felt I learnt much about the inner lives of any of the protagonists (Pocohantas, for example, is throughout a picture of serene inscrutability). Ultimately, I didn't understand what Malick was trying to do with this movie; and it's great length left me indifferent and perplexed long before the end.",4,1,2,28 September 2010
Frost_Nixon," A retrospective retrospective; but good
","In 1976, David Frost interviewed Richard Nixon. Journalists speaks to politician – it hardly seems like big news. But Frost was an ambitious talk show host on the make, Nixon had been silent since falling from power, and in the event, many considered the resulting interviews revealing. Still, why make a film about the interviews instead of re-showing the originals? It's true, there's an interesting story to how Frost raised his own money to buy Nixon's participation, but Ron Howard's film fails to make this story wholly dramatic – he chooses to present the background in pseudo-documentary style, with his actors giving in-character interviews. He could, of course, have directly interviewed the real protagonists; but this would have punctured the film's recreated world, where Martin Sheen is Frost and Frank Langella is Nixon. Sheen is as good as he was playing Tony Blair, another smooth talking intellectual lightweight; although in both cases, he just misses capturing the full star quality of the original. Langella seems more statesmanlike than his model, less shifty - Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon' was more like I imagine the man, although that's really the whole point – that what we are seeing is an imagining, albeit firmly grounded in public facts. Nixon died with his reputation un-recovered, but has proved the inspiration for a multitude of movies and even an opera. Meanwhile, the avuncular John Birt, a widely disliked bureaucrat during his later tenure at the BBC, must never have expected to model a major supporting role in a Hollywood film. In Frost's case, one imagines, the expectations were different.",8,0,1,11 July 2009
Walk the Line," I shot a film in Memphis...
","Poor boy grows up in rural America, overcome adversity and becomes a successful musician, repeatedly overcoming the scepticism of the music industry to achieve massive hits. But he struggles with the emotional strain of retaining a wife at home and a mistress out on the road; and also with an addiction to drugs. After facing some criticism for confronting social problems, he is finally accepted as a national treasure, and the story ends with a caption telling us he continued to make music until his old age. Meanwhile, the film stars an actor with an uncanny physical resemblance to the real thing, who even contributes to his own musical turns in the movie; but there are a few slightly corny scenes where the writing of a particular song is linked just a little too directly to events in the character's life. Now, this could be a synopsis of 'Walk the Line', but it just as easily be a synopsis of 'Ray', the biopic of Ray Charles released a couple of years earlier. From which one can note how if you take an authorised biography as your source material, it follows that your going to get a certain sort of product as a result. But 'Walk the Line' suffers a bit from the comparison: although personally I prefer the music of Mr. Cash to that of Mr. Charles, the latter's story is more remarkable: black, blind, addicted to heroin, he refused to play segregated venues; whereas Cash, unloved by his father, addicted to prescription drugs, and who recorded an album in a prison, appears to be trumped on most of these points. Additionally, the story features a large role for Cash's eventual second wife, June Carter, who did write 'Ring of Fire' but who is otherwise uninteresting. If you don't like Cash's music, the film will probably leave you cold. But for anyone whose blood runs chill on hearing Cash's deep bass voice sing 'I shot a man in Reno', the movie will still appeal, and with the likes of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis included in the dramatis personae, it's a history, not just of Cash, but of the birth of rock-and-roll.",6,1,3,15 September 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Satire, but who's the target?
","There are odd lines in 'Borat: Make Cultural Learnings of America for benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', to give the film its full and deliberately preposterous title, that really made me smile; for example, when Borat's producer dresses up as Oliver Hardy, Borat comments 'I had not come to America to fight with a man disguised as Adolf Hitler'. But overall, I struggled to understand this film. The character of Borat, invented and played by comedian Sacha Baron-Chen, is a central Asian man of wildly exaggerated naiveté and crudity, who in this movie makes a voyage of discovery to the U.S.A. The film is clearly a satire of sorts, but who is the target? Certainly not Kazakhstan, for the Kazakhstan, as it appears in this movie, is a generic shorthand for underdevelopment and backwardness. So is it America who Baron-Cohen is satirising, exposing its true nature through juxtapositioning it with the ridiculous? But this interpretation doesn't quite work either, The Borat character is simply too outlandish to provide much insight into the real America; most of the people Borat interacts with awkwardly humour or ignore him, and even though the behaviour of some is revealingly bad, I just felt sorry for most of his victims. There's simply no rational way to respond to someone so dreadful, and that Baron-Cohen was able to find some ordinarily unpleasant people to mock somewhere in the United States is hardly so surprising. If indeed the film is showing us candid-camera style moments: this was the sort of comedy with which Baron-Cohen made his name, but one wonders how many of these scenes could have been filmed if they weren't in fact staged, in spite of the painfully believable dialogues. I loved Chris Morris's 'Brass Eye', a program with substantial candid sections, but which successfully mocked trends in modern current affairs programming, self-promoting celebrities unable to see through naked idiocy if presented with an opportunity for publicity, and ourselves for putting up with both of the above. But I spent most of this film just cringing, unable to ascertain who the joke was supposed to be on.",3,1,2,20 April 2009
Alien 3," Planet of the British!
","Ridely Scott's 'Alien' was an excellently constructed thriller. In the opening, a strong ensemble cast faced a vague sense of menace; over the course of the film, this gradually transformed into a fight to the death between just one of the characters (Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) and the eponymous beast. The sequel, directed by James Cameron, was also good, but at heart a more conventional Hollywood blockbuster. For the third film, David Fincher was in the director's chair, and I'm a big fan of Fincher's later films, 'The Game' and 'Fight Club'. But 'Alien3' is not his greatest work.Fincher keeps the murky, claustrophobic feel of the earlier films (a mood also apparent in his next film, 'Se7en'). In the original movie, the camera never dwelt on the alien, we only saw it in brief, terrifying glimpses. This was justified by the alien's exceptional speed of movement, but perhaps necessitated by limitations in what the special effects department could do, circa 1979. By 1992, technology had moved on, but Fincher stuck to the formula, and the fact that we never truly comprehend the exact nature of the monster adds to its capacity to scare us. But Fincher also added some broad comedy, a lot of gratuitous swearing, and, with his setting of a prison planet occupied almost entirely by British-accented convicts, a certain resemblance to a vulgarised 'Porridge'. Riply, meanwhile, has transformed into someone almost unimaginably macho; the prisoners are supposedly men with two Y chromosomes, but a desexualised Ripley appears to possess more testosterone than all of them together.The real problem with the film, however, is principally that as the third movie in a franchise, there's not really anywhere new for it to go. The plot is presented to us with little in the way of underlying explanation, but it's basic contours are already defined. The fourth film in the series was called 'Alien Resurrection'; this one might have been called 'Alien Rehash'. It ends with an overlong action sequence devoid of variety (whereas in the first film, every kill was sudden and fresh). And the impact of the ending is muted when you know that in spite of the apparently terminal conclusion, another movie followed in a couple of years. The rest of Fincher's work is all original. But here he is just another hack director, forcing another life out of a great, but exhausted concept. Two films should really have been enough.",5,202,210,16 August 2005
Ali," Come back Rocky, all is forgiven!
","Muhammed Ali was the best boxer of his generation, a scurrilous and incisive wit, and a black activist and role model. Stripped of his title after refusing to fight in Vietnam, and subsequently beaten on his return to the ring, he went on to reclaim his world titles, before retiring and (very probably as a direct result of his long career) developing a form of Parkinson's disease. With such a rich biography, a film of Ali's life should by rights be among 'the greatest' of movies, but sadly, 'Ali' has been made by Michael Mann, a director whose work is both middlebrow and pretentious: it always seems to be making a point about saying something, without actually saying very much at all. For this film, Mann has chosen to construct a collage of scenes from Ali's life, set to music, rather than to build a conventional narrative. It's an odd approach: to those utterly unfamiliar with the events of Ali's life, I suspect the film would seem baffling: yet there's little in the way of deep insight into Ali's character to compensate. Indeed, while Will Smith, an actor who usually features in comic movie, shows (and not for the first time) that he can play straight, in his hands Ali is (whisper is softly) almost a little dull: the playful menace of the original is mimicked but not matched.And some of Mann's decisions I just don't understand. The film begins, for example, with a handful of dialogue-free scenes prior to showing us Ali's first big fight. The fight thus begins before the film has had a chance to induce any sort of emotional attachment to the character. And the stylised representation of the fighting itself comprises the most boring representation of boxing on screen that I have ever seen. Personally, I'm no great fan of the sport, but there's a visceral quality in evidence when you watch any real fight on television that just isn't conveyed here. In part, this is because Mann seems determined to eschew narrative potential at all times, as if to ensure his film is never a sporting melodrama, even when he is reconstructing exactly such an event in real life. For example: in Sylvester Stallone's film 'Rocky', hardly a classic of cinema, a key element of the fight scenes is the depiction of the ring girls, who parade with the number of each round before it begins. They naturally add to the narrative tension for the audience, pacing us through the fight. In the final fight shown in 'Ali' (the famous Ali-Foreman encounter in Zaire), we also see the ring girls: but they hold their numbers off camera, so we have no idea how long the fight has to go. If unintentional, his would be so incompetent I can only assume it is deliberate; but rather baffling, nonetheless. By contrast, the purpose of using uplifting, 'spiritual' African music to accompany the Zairean scenes is, on the other hand, crassly obvious. The film thus seems to aspire to force us to assign a certain higher meaning to the events it depicts; yet has no interest in milking the basic story for its innate drama. Instead of showing us how things were, and leaving us to ponder why Ali became an icon, the film serves us a legendary, but vaguely defined, hero. The failure to even mention Ali's later suffering (in spite of a 'what happened next' caption at the end of the film) seems cowardly and wrong.For all that, Ali's story remains mesmerising. But this film made me want to watch a proper documentary instead.",6,0,3,26 October 2005
Skyfall," Too much
","For the first few minutes of 'Skyfall', you might think you were watching a tense, downbeat, almost-realistic thriller. Then Agent Bond answers his boss in London with a curt, improbable 'Ma'am', and the silliness begins. Of course, Bond's is a trademark silliness, one that has come to be so perceived as part of what defines Englishness that the character was even included in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics; and it's fair to say that in many ways, Skyfall is an entertaining film, as it romps violently, and theatrically, around the globe in the firm tradition of its many predecessors. Like the other films made using current actor Daniel Craig, there's a superficially dark mood fronting the in-jokes and computer-assisted choreography, and a little less lasciviousness than some earlier incarnations, although I wouldn't go as far as to say that there's anything here that could actually be taken seriously. Sam Mendes handles the job of directing competently, and most of the cast give it a spirited effort: Javier Barden makes a suave, effete villain but Julie Dench is somewhat (and surprisingly) anaemic as Bond's boss M. Personally, I've never quite got the appeal of the franchise; and much as I like the highlands of Scotland, where the conclusion is set, the film is unquestionably overlong. I've seen worse light entertainment; but something so flimsy would be sweeter if shorter.",6,1,5,29 April 2013
Catch Me If You Can," No kind of everyman
","The story of Frank Abegnale Jr., teenage conman extraordinaire, should make for an entertaining movie; but in Stephen Spielberg's hands, the story falls a little flat. Partly this is due to the casting of the dull Leonardo di Caprio in the leading role; and partly because the careful reconstruction of the 1960s is too familiar from countless other movies to be interesting in itself. Mostly, however, the film loses impact because of Spielberg's apparent determination to weave boringly quintessential themes into his story; instead of an epic tale of derring-do, at times it unfolds like a dull tale of a kid who loves his family trying to live the American dream. This may or may not be how it happened; but personally, I think there would have been more interest in the movie without the attempt to depict its frankly remarkable anti-hero as some kind of everyman.",6,0,3,29 August 2009
Stop-Loss," Stops short of being great; but still worth seeing
","'Stop-Loss' deals with the problems soldiers have in getting out of the army; both through the technical procedure of 'Stop-Loss', whereby a solider is sent back for a second consecutive tour of duty, but also through the difficulties of adjusting to civilian life after time on the front line. Many dramas set after the Vietnam war explored the idea that the sense of a victory well won (absent then, as now) might be critical to enabling a soldier to make the transition from combat animal back to member of civic society. The film is well made, powerfully acted, and doesn't pretend that it's characters are angels (although it justly acknowledges their bravery). But it doesn't really go very far beyond its premise, and the ending is given a slightly more upbeat (but inconclusive) spin than could have been applied. The final credits remind us of the startling high number of American troops to have fought in Afghanistan or Iraq in the 21st century; wars that are fought (for good or bad) while the rest of us get on with our lives in an altogether easier place.",7,7,7,12 June 2011
United 93," Horrifically fresh
","Director Paul Greengrass has made the unlikely transition from making worthy Birth docu-dramas to frenetic Hollywood blockbusters; lying somewhere in between is this film about the terrorist attack on America in 2001, based on a combination of known fact and plausible interpolation. Potentially, a story of hijacked aircraft crashing faces some of the problems that affected attempts to make a movie about another iconic, era-defining human tragedy, the sinking of the Titantic 90 years earlier: for sure, it was a huge event in world history, but the basic narrative is apparently quite dull: innocent people board a transport of some description, something terrible happens and a lot of death follows. This led to James Cameron, in his film about the epic ship, creating a preposterous and melodramatic back story for his travellers, one that attempted to be large enough to actually contain the sinking of the boat within it. Greengrass thankfully does nothing of the sort here, and there are actually several good reasons why his doesn't need to. Firstly, this drama occurred during the era of modern communications; these have given us the detail that can only be speculated about in the case of the Titanic, and moreover, how this information came to be communicated is a story in itself, whose conclusion is that even the might of the United States military is curiously impotent in the face of a wholly unexpected but immediate threat. Next, there's a natural story that isn't just one of accidental death, in the efforts of passengers on United flight 93 to resist their hijackers (hence the title of this film, although much of this movie is actually set in the air traffic and military command centres, as Greengrass sets his central tale in just the right amount of context). There's also the immediacy of the events, which gives them a horrific charge in a way a story of people who would be dead by now in any case cannot; not only do we still remember the day, it took place in what is still essentially our world. Only when the passengers gather up scissors to prepare a counter attack does it briefly feel like a piece of history. Personally, I find Greengrass's 'Bourne' films somewhat overcooked; but here he gets everything just right. The sad thing is that none of the people he pays tribute here survived to be acknowledged for their bravery, which although it did not save themselves, certainly saved others.",9,4,6,12 September 2010
Casablanca," Surprisingly modern
","Watching 'Casablanca' for the first time one is struck by a number of things: the already-known dialogue (though of course, not including the exact line, 'Play it again, Sam', which no-one actually says); the swanky nature of Rick's bar, the very un-African nature of Casablanca in general and the fact that Sam, although a minor character, is a black man presented as intelligent and even a friend of the Humphrey Bogart's hero, in a way that can't have been completely normal in 1942. I also like the way that Sam's music is integrated into the film, although in places the soundtrack overdoes the romantic notes. It's also interesting to think about the story-lines chosen by film-makers before the war was won, although the film isn't quite as detached from the allied cause as it first suggests. Overall, it's aged much better than most films of its era, probably because it's mainly a character study, albeit one supported by a heavy dose of wisecracking; and it's stateless characters, drifting through a world that has lost it's certainties, live beyond the bounds of conventional morality in a very matter-of-fact way. Of course it won Oscars, but a comparison with the modern day is telling; in how many contemporary blockbusters does the hero let his girl go?",7,1,4,18 September 2010
Minority Report," Not really trying to be intelligent
","'Minority Report' is a big budget, Steven Spielberg-directed futuristic thriller: I found it disappointing, for three reasons. Firstly, it's definitely not 'hard' sci-fi: although it has an intriguing premise, a lot of the mechanics of how its world is supposed to actually work is not made clear, unlikely stuff seems to happen for the sole reason it's useful for the purposes of advancing the plot, and society seems divided between gleaming halls and squalor in a way that makes for impressive visuals but is never explained. Secondly, the hero (played by Tom Cruise) appears to be possessed of near super-powers: it's a standard plot line where an individual is forced to run from an entire system, but it's hard to sympathise with him when he seems to be capable of extraordinary feats without breaking sweat, jumping between moving vehicles hundreds of metres above the ground, or single-handedly fighting off an entire armed-response crew. Finally, the story of institutional corruption ultimately focuses on individual motives: the leading protagonists transpire to be extraordinarily personally connected to the system that they manage. And while 'police chief is actually a murderer' makes for a neat story, in the real world, bad policemen cause damage in generally more subtle, less direct ways. Ultimately, nothing engaged me here: there was plenty of material, but too little interest in exploring it in depth: the ideas provide a backdrop for an action movie, but they're sadly not as important as might first seem.",5,0,1,22 May 2013
In Bruges," Hit men are not intrinsically interesting or funny
","Director Martin McDonagh says he was inspired to make 'In Bruges' after being stranded in the city and concluding it was beautiful, but boring. I know the feeling: stuck there as a 15 year-old on a school trip, my classmates and I spent the day following round the hapless bloke in the yellow suit on the day that McDonalds were launching Chicken McNuggets. 'In Bruges' got rave reviews; but I fancy my own story is no worse than a rather underwhelming tale of two hit men. I found the comedy thin, the characters unappealing and their motivation unbelievable, and the ending predictable; a clichéd gangster movie isn't any less so, just because it has a historic setting. I think my adult self might think more of the city; but this movie left me cold.",5,3,9,30 November 2010
Chinatown," L.A. Story
","Roman Polanski's celebrated neo-noir 'Chinatown' was made when the director, and his star Jack Nicholson, were arguably both at the peak of their powers; indeed, there's a strong case that the early 1970s represented a golden age for the Hollywood movie, full stop. One achievement of this film is the actor's, Nicholson creating the character of the fast talking private eye while staying clear of the shadow of Philip Marlowe: perhaps one can think of Jake Gittes as a younger version of Chandler's hero, not yet as disillusioned (at least, this is true at the start of the film). One can also state he avoids his own shadow, playing wholly within the role, something he has not always managed since. Meanwhile, Robert Towne's intelligent script, about the economic growth and control of Los Angeles, seems particularly appropriate for a Hollywood film. In late career, Polanski has made some pretty ropey thrillers: but here his direction is taut throughout, and the film is compelling and atmospheric. It deserves its reputation; and passes muster alongside the other amazing movies that Nicholson made between 1970 and 1975.",9,0,1,24 October 2008
Erin Brockovich," Caring too much
","My favourite film about a corporate lawsuit is Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter', which features a shifty, self-hating lawyer and a tragedy where it's very unclear whether anyone is to blame, and even if they are, whether anything is to gain by holding them to account. Stephen Soderbergh's 'Erin Brockovich' is a rather different story, in which Erin (played by Julia Roberts) brings a multi-million dollar corporation to its knees through a simple combination of loving her kids, wearing short skirts, swearing a lot and above all else, by caring too much. The latter is really her trump card - whenever there's a dispute about any point in the case, the corporate lawyers are always wrong and Erin is right because she cares. The film is based on a true story, and maybe this is actually how it happened, but it certainly doesn't provide any moral ambiguity to interest the viewer. In true American style, the happy ending is that all the good characters make several million dollars.",6,1,3,19 February 2010
The Death of Stalin," On satire and monsters
","Armando Iannucci's political British and U.S.-set comedies have shown how systems encourage the worst people and incentivise the most perverse of behaviours. In 'The Death of Stalin', he takes his sharp eye to Russia, and tells the story of the power struggle between Beria and Khrushchev that followed Stalin's death. As usual with Iannucci, the comedy comes through everyone acting always in character, only worse. There's certainly no whitewashing here, although Beria, who was purged, is shown as more competent and maybe even more human than his rivals. But the film doesn't feature Russian actors or dialogue, and Iannucci's best work speaks specifically of the delusions of the countries in which it is set; aside from Jeffrey Tambor's Malenkov, the other characters feel more drawn from the traditions of countries from which their actors hail. And only in 'The Thick of It' has Iannucci ever made me love his awful creations. Perhaps the limitation here is that few people today have any remaining illusions about Stalin and his cronies; it might have been more subversive (although not more accurate) to show them in a warmer light.",7,0,1,13 April 2018
The Big Lebowski," Funny peculiar
","'The Big Lebowski' tells an enjoyable shaggy dog tale with Jeff Bridges playing the shaggy dog - slacker dude Lebowski, who gets bizarrely caught up in a kidnapping scam.  There are lots of laugh out load moments, but this is a very peculiar film, varying between downbeat black comedy and pure stand-up, interlaced with self-knowing references to numerous different styles of movie making and peppered with a pointlessly astonishing expletive count.The Coen brothers are very clever, but sincerity is never their strong point, and, although it pains me to diss any film with Townes van Zandt on the soundtrack, the net result is rather unaffecting. And it's not that I don't like weird movies; but 'The Big Lebowski' (in defiance of its hero's philosophy) seems to try just a little too hard.",6,2,5,17 April 2004
Star Trek," Going backwards, timidly
","I was never too much into 'Star Trek', the famous 1960s sci-fi television series characterised, with hindsight, by its liberal optimism. These days, the name is a brand that has been applied to various additional series and countless movies, the latest of which purports to tell us the story of the early days of the original series' characters. And it starts charmlessly, with product placement interspersing an utterly generic story – while the actors chosen to play the roles look the parts, the tale of wannabe captain James T. Kirk could have come from any movie about a young hotshot in any context. There's a silly time-travel plot as well that I couldn't make much of. Things get a little better when Leonard Nimoy (who originally played Spock, the series' defining character) turns up in a cameo, and Simon Pegg, who plays Scotty the engineer, at least attacks the role with gusto. But if you're not a fan already, it's hard to imagine you'll find much to appeal to you in a film that does what you might have expected it too, but absolutely nothing more.",4,4,8,8 September 2009
Fight Club," ker-pow!
","Starting to watch Fight Club, my first thought's that basically it's a re-run of The Game, Fincher's previous (and arguably under-rated) film.  The two have a lot in common, which is no bad thing.  Skillful direction, an original but preposterous plot played with a straight face (but without undue pomposity or preachiness) and given time to build to climax, and an idea (that we have to lose what we have in order to appreciate it) that is not, in all honesty, seriously explored in either film, but which sustains entertainment that pitches in well above the brain-dead level in both cases. Of the pair, Fight Club is funnier, but more or less, the formula's the same.Then, three quarters of the way through, Fight Club pulls a trick.  It's cleverly done (once the shock hits you, you suddenly spot the clues) but unfortunately it sweeps the ground from beneath this movie's feet.  After the coup, all you are left with are boring sub-Matrix style special effect violence and bogus existential meditations.  The film was never really heading to a classical straight ending, but, you might think, surely they could do something better than this.And then, at the every end,  the wreckage is raised.  Two great gags in the last thirty seconds (though how one passed the censor I do not know) turn the joke firmly back on us.  The timing and execution of both are perfect; though the whole film is not, you'll see few others as well-directed, fun and fresh.",9,1,3,23 December 2002
Citizen Kane," Mightily impressive
","When many films from the 1960s now seem ridiculously dated, it's amazing how modern 'Citizen Kane' still feels after over 60 years.  The scene composition, the lighting, the credits, the discontinuous narrative, the moral ambivalence of its 'hero', all seem to belong to a much more recent era.  Even the themes - the power of the press, celebrity, ambition, etc. still all seem pertinent - and what is Xanadu if not Disneyland?  Of course, some of the dialogue inevitably seems clumsy, and the final conclusion is slightly weak, but few if any films can have so expanded the cinematographic vocabulary of their time.  Still much more than the greatest ever film about a man in love with a sledge!",7,0,5,26 November 2003
Darkest Hour," Reducing history to generic myth
","With hindsight, it was absolutely a good thing that Britain was led by the unlikely figure of Winston Churchill during World War Two. The politics around Churchill's ascension to power are very interesting, from the desperate desire of many to avoid war at all costs, to the major role of Churchill's own incompetence during the Norway campaign in the fall of Chamberlain's government. There's lots of good material for a film here, but unfortunately 'Darkest Hour' isn't that movie, preferring to exaggerate both Churchill's heroism and buffoonishness, while painting his political opponents as virtual traitors to the country. Meanwhile, the dramatization of the story reduces it to the banal narrative of a Hollywood biopic, with the premier granted an unlikely epiphany on the London Underground. Gary Oldman buries himself in the character, but it's in the service of myth more then history.",5,2,3,12 May 2020
Monster," Spot on
","The cinemas often seem to be over-run by films depicting implausible female serial killers with unusual sex lives as inhuman monsters. But this film is actually based on a true story, and in spite of its title, never reduces its central character to sub-human status. Indeed, anyone who has seen the documentary films Nick Broomfield made about Aileen Wuornos during her time on Death Row will be struck by how precisely Charlize Theron has captured her voice, her physical presence, and quite a lot of her character, although she never quite manages to represent the full extent of Wournos' madness, which is perhaps slightly suppressed in order to allow the film to bear at least some resemblance to a more normal story. Still, this is a tough and brave movie, actually interested in understanding how something as terrible as the events it depicts could have happened, and worth watching although unquestionably grim.",8,2,2,16 November 2006
Memento," ! gnikathtaerb
","This stunning film confirms there's still life yet in the thriller genre. Summarise it in terms of its most conventional elements: a serial killer, a quest for justice, a bent cop and a convoluted plot and it might sound like a thousand other hackneyed films marked only by their stunning unoriginality.  Watch it, however, and it takes your breath away.Nolan's triumph in this film is the perfect marriage of form and content. How you you make an original, engaging thriller?  A conventional approach is to confuse the viewer, cut the story up into lots of separate threads that are only re-united in the ending.  Yawn yawn yawn! But this is a film about a man with memory loss. Each moment is new to him, because he never knows what happened before.  So Nolan tells his story in reverse, capturing his character's utter placelessness and simultaneous assembling a plot that is complex, baffling, yet original and natural at the same time, its structure just the consequence of its hero's plight.This is audacious, but Nolan pulls it off.  With a dry wit, moments of poignancy, plenty of action and some interesting questions that lurk below the surface, he never underestimates the viewer's intelligence, in a tale as real as it is bizarre.  Definitely a film to be seen more than once!",9,0,2,9 December 2002
Amistad," Not bad, but an unsubtle ending
","The case of 'La Amistad' marked an important development in the separation of the U.S. executive and judiciary; and almost incidentally was also a key development in the onset of civil war and the eventual abolition of slavery. The case considered whether a group of slaves captured in Africa, who had revolted while on board a ship in U.S. waters, should be given freedom, at a time when the U.S. law stated that only those born as slaves could be treated as tradeable commodities. The legal case was clear, but giving preference to a group of Africans over white Europeans and Americans was politically dangerous, although in the end, the prisoners were freed.The genius of Stephen Spielberg's film of the case is the way that in the beginning, he presents the Africans to us as they would have appeared to the Americans of that time: animal and threatening, and forces us to see how 'civilised' men might have regarded them as of another species altogether (although of course, even accepting this does not lead to a real argument for the cruelty of their treatment). But as the two sides learn to communicate, so the humanity of the slaves is revealed, both within and without the film. The weak points are a score that over-emphasises the film's message, and the strange role played by the character of John Quincey Adams, a former president who became involved in the case. For the first three quarters of the film, the story is that of a young lawyer, at first cynical, later increasingly committed to the cause, who builds the correct legal case for freedom. But when the case goes before the Supremene Court, Adams steps in, and makes a windy and completely unlegalistic appeal for the men's freedom on the simple grounds that slavery is wrong. I know nothing of the true history, but if this really happened, I (if I were the writer) would have taken it out, because it breaks the nuanced pattern of the story to date; but one fears it has been included for precisely that reason, to allow the movie to wear its heart on its sleeve. It's a shame that Spielberg felt the need to tell us so explicitly that slavery is wrong.The events depicted happened when the United States was only recently divorced from Britain, and a number of British actors play certain key figures without disguising their accents, including Anthony Hopkins as Adams and the late Nigel Hawthorne (good value as always) as his successor van Buren.",7,0,1,12 December 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Another Star Wars movie (yawn!) - but another Peter Cushing movie too!
","'Rogue One' is officially a 'Star Wars Story', which means we get many familiar elements: a rollicking (and explosion-filled) adventure in outer space, almost human androids, switches to pull, chasms to leap and weapons to destroy, and dehumanised stormtroopers to kill (the fact that stormtroopers are hidden behind protective uniforms including face masks makes them more frightening adversaries, but also removes any moral complexity associated with their annihilation). The original Star Wars movie was partially filmed in the North African desert, and a desert environment has also featured in some subsequent movies in the series; in this one, a substantial section seems more inspired by the experience of American troops attempting to police Baghdad. The film contains various other nods to previous films in the series, without recapitulating their plots as shamelessly as 'The Force Awakens' did; as an immediate prequel to the 1979 film, it also uses digital technology to resuscitate now dead actors to reprise their roles, including Peter Cushing (brilliantly) and Carrie Fischer (less successfully) - perhaps the fact that Cushing's character has aspects of the undead in the original makes it easier to bring him back to life. The ending is nicely judged in theory but marred by the failure to lift the digital Fisher out of the uncanny valley.The film features a feisty female heroine, praised by many for providing gender-balance to the previously masculine Star Wars world, but she's a bit too perfect for my liking. One of the things that made the original work for me that none of the naÃ¯ve Luke, the money-grabbing Han nor the sarcastic Leia are obvious role-models. We also get one character who channels the force to become a martial-arts superhero; I much preferred the subtler demonstration of the force's power shown by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original film (and indeed, the theme of the force is much stronger, to my reckoning, when presented as the power of self-control and focus than when it appears to confer mystical powers).'Rogue One' is considered by many to be their favourite 'Star Wars' movie since the original trilogy; for me, the shtick has grown a bit tired (I loved 'A New Hope' on release, but I was seven years old at the time!). Still, the film mercifully lacks the over-busy aesthetic (and tedious dialogue) of George Lucas's later films in favour of something closer to the mood and spirit of the original; it works as entertainment, even if I suspect this fictional universe doesn't really have much new to show us beyond what has already been done.",6,2,4,17 December 2019
Seven Years in Tibet," Half-way up the mountain
","The scenary's the real star of Seven Years in Tibet: the film begins with some excellent mountain climbing sequences, and the bleak but gorgeous Himalayan skyscape looms high above all subsequent action.  But Brad Pitt, in the lead role, is as wooden as his accent, with none of the charisma he later showed in Fight Club, though David Thewlis is predictably excellent as his companion.  Unfortunately, the film's depiction of Tibetan society seems idealised; and most crucially, the everyday reality of life in Tibet for the German mountaineers is dealt with only sketchily, in spite of the film's great length and in spite of the fact that it's this that underpins the development of the characters throughout the story.  But the story itself is good (and tragic); and the film gets enough right to make you want to know more about the land and its history. This isn't a great movie; but still worth watching.",7,0,1,26 February 2003
The Hunger Games," Good until the end
","For a mainstream thriller derived from a best-selling, teen-oriented book, 'The Hunger Games' is actually quite good. Indeed, more than that, it's gripping and far from stupid, its use of computer graphics unobtrusive (you could have made a version of the story without any, but it still works in its current form), and there's no attempt to over-romanticise the story or laden it down with uneccessary sex. It's Hollywood, of course, so the most beautiful and stylishly dressed people are the heroes (including heroine Jennifer Lawrence, who to her credit is not only lovely but also good in her role); the ridiculous and ugly the bad guys; but this aside, one might even call it a serious movie. The only thing slightly disappointing is the ending, in which the heroes appear to choose individual salvation over raising class consciousness, and the tone of the movie implies that this is actually a good thing. I don't know how the book worked, but there's something slightly limp in such a finale, and disappointing after a generally well-put together film.",8,3,9,23 September 2012
12 Monkeys," Monkey dung
","Onetime cartoonist Terry Gillian has a vivid Gothic imagination, but also a long track record of proving that this alone is not enough to define a good film-maker. Unfortunately for Gilliam, his films are not just bad, but unusual and bad as well, and so while many bad film-makers have made fortunes, Gilliam has repeatedly lost Hollywood millions. 'Twelve Monkeys', a science-fiction thriller starring human ape Bruce Willis, isn't quite as bad as it initially promises to be, but features characteristically wacky editing and a self-consciously confused plot, as well as what must be Brad Pitt's most annoying role ever. Its visual richness can't hide the simple truth that it's insufficiently funny or clever; and what's sad is that the same can be said of most of Gilliam's other movies. As a set designer, he gets top marks. But as a director, he makes a pretty good cartoonist.",3,20,45,4 February 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Essentially unnecessary
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was fresh and funny, a mixture of pirate adventure, comedy and horror film; but it's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', only illustrates the point that most sequels would have been better off unmade. Specatacular special effects come to completely dominate the film, mostly because of the essentially uninteresting (and, in the way of all middle-parts of trilogies, unresolved) plot; above all else, for all the visual inventiveness, there's nothing new here, just an endless re-interpretation of the same jokes and characters that sparkled in the first movie but which here just pall. The odd moment made me smile; but this is an overlong, and essentially unnecessary film.",5,0,0,4 June 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pantomine pirates
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a hugely entertaining, comedy-cum-action-cum-horror romp, with Johnny Depp, arguably the finest Hollywood actor of his generation, running riot as Captain Jack Sparrow, reportedly modelled on Keith Richards. In terms of how the film is constructed, the nature of his role is interesting, as there's an almost conventional story without him: a romantic lead, a beautiful, feisty heroine, a love rival and an evil villain account for most of the plot without Sparrow even getting a mention. Sparrow is more like an annoying child than anything, cropping up and getting in the way, pursuing his own ambitions and desires with childish abandon. As is often said, he really is the 'world's worst pirate', scarcely meriting being taken seriously; but instead of just being a comic extra, he's actually the film's central character. It's hard to imagine the story working without Depp in the role, but fortunately, it doesn't have to. Sit back and smile.",8,0,2,23 May 2011
12 Angry Men," A well judged drama
","Lumet's courthouse drama wears its liberal heart on its sleeve.  But there's some courage too in setting the action entirely after the trial is over: we see only the deliberations of the jury, trying to make sense of the evidence.  In comparison to more modern (and histrionic) attempts to anatomise the legal process (such as the absurd Murder One), the merits of this judgment shine through: less really is more.  The ensemble cast is excellent, and all the characterisations are well-conceived and executed, with considerably more depth than is common in films from this era.  The only real failing is that the plot goes nowhere that you don't expect it to; but that's a flaw of many films far worse than this.",6,3,9,5 January 2003
Public Enemies," Solid, but lacks imagination
","Bryan Burrough's book, 'Public Enemies', was an exhaustive account of the wave of bank-robberies that afflicted America in the early 1930s, and the people who undertook them. In his forward, the author makes the interesting point that the story proceeded in an essentially modern world, a place with automatic weapons, automobiles, and air-planes. Michael Mann's film dramatises some of the book, concentrating on the person of John Dillinger, and it's a fairly typical Michael Mann film: heavyweight and solid, slightly over-glamorising its participants, pitching the tale as a personal fight between the lawman and the criminal (though to be fair, the book also does this to some extent) but somewhat emotionally unaffecting and impersonal. The sense of Dillinger as one-part folk-hero, one part cold-blooded murderer, never quite comes through as Mann prefers to show us a story of people just doing what they have to do (a world-view he also showed us in 'Heat'). This is a fairly true representation of what happened; but a little bit more creativity would not have gone amiss.",7,0,0,10 May 2013
Madagascar," Smart and funny
","I loved 'Toy Story', but I must confess to having been less than enamoured of most of the computer-animated movies released in its wake, in spite of the acclaim that many of them have gathered. To me, 'A Bugs Life' and 'Antz' were not funny enough, and were further limited by having classical hero-centric narratives; 'Ice Age' had the same problems (and addition, a carelessly assembled plot); 'The Incredibles' was smarter but somewhat right-wing in its underlying ideology. But 'Madagascar' is wonderful, a cartoon full of razor-sharp humour, with just the right degree of self-awareness and a loopily inspired idea at its heart: a lovable New York lion has his instincts reawakened on returning to the wild, and discovers to his horror that he needs to eat his friends! There's a lot of great humour here in the 'Toy Story' vein, in that although there's a fantastical premise (based on anthropomorphised beings), given that premise, everything that follows makes perfect sense. To give away just one of the jokes that demonstrates how clever the script is, the animals (while still in the zoo) turn off the background jungle ambiance in order to get a good night's sleep; and as the birdsong fades, we hear instead the real background ambiance of the big city (i.e police sirens!) Maybe the script is even a little too witty for kids. For this big kid, however, it was a treat.",8,1,2,2 May 2006
Bloody Sunday," A self-fulfilling prophesy of war
","The partition of Ireland, though contested, is defensible; the subsequent neglect by the British government of the rights of northern Catholics is not. Nor is the shooting, on what has been termed 'Bloody Sunday', of unarmed protesters objecting to the absence of these rights. Moreover, these events disastrously but understandably strengthened the roots that the I.R.A. was able to put down in the Catholic community. An initial enquiry vindicated the soldiers; but many felt this a whitewash, and Paul Greengrass's film shows an alternative version of events, based on extensive research. What we see, messily and unmelodramatically, is not a clean fight between good and evil - the demonstration was certainly hostile and not entirely peaceable - but a grotesque tragedy resulting from a self-fulfilling belief on the part of the army that they were already at war. The verdict might be incompetence rather than murder; but when the incompetence is itself premeditated, the difference is a fine one. To make a film effectively endorsing one of Irisah Republicanism's more potent claims was a brave move by I.T.V.; but a more recent enquiry has largely confirmed its accuracy.",8,2,5,6 February 2011
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Even less like the Waltons...
","When George Bush Senior said that America should be less like 'The Simpsons', he probably didn't mean it should be more like 'South Park', the crudely animated, and downright crude, satire of American life. 'South Park' adapts to the big screen unexpectedly well, with an outrageous, almost-coherent plot, a musical format, loads of jokes and a hilarious central idea (the U.S.A. declaring war on poor, innocuous Canada). At its best, it's almost Chris Morris-like in its ability to make serious points in the most offensive manner possible. I suspect the formula has its limits, for at times the film seems as purile as its characters Terrence and Philip, the Canadian humourists whose dirty jokes trigger the war: there's a fine line between laughing at kids who can't stop swearing, and believing that four letter words are funny per se. But viewed as a one-off, it's fresh, funny and surprisingly political, and makes 'The Simpsons' seems cosy in comparison.",8,2,2,30 October 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Lazy slapstick
","If you've seen the first part of 'Ice Age' you already know what to expect from the sequel: silly, annoying animals; electronic animation that combines beautiful rendering of the central characters with a cartoony background; not much in the way of a plot; and a slightly nonsensical, life-affirming message. This movie got a lot of criticism which is strange only because its predecessor was more liked; to my mind, both are relatively second rate if compared to the best of the genre. What I really dislike is the lazy way the story blows its own potential: there's an underlying poignancy in the tale (which is set against the backdrop of the extinction of the mammoths), and yet the bizarre conclusion (that the mammoths are alive and well after all) not only makes no sense (even the youngest child knows there are no mammoths any more) but also makes the whole basis on which we have been invited to interact with the film seem fraudulent. Compared to the way that films like 'Toy Story' and 'Madagascar' actually engage with the reality of life and death (while still managing to be very funny), it seems like a poor showing, and proof that computer graphics alone are not enough to make a good film.",3,1,4,19 August 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," Truly brooding
","The splendid Ricardo Darin, star of the late great Fabien Bielinski's two movies, is back on fine form in this film. Superficially it's more conventional than Bielinski's films, being a straightforward story of a veteran (ex-) policeman who can't let his most interesting unsolved case lie. For sure, the plot is tricksy and there's evidence of corruption in high places; but this is all run-of-the-mill for this genre. What's unusual about this film is it's focus on character: the brooding hero is another stereotype, but Darin's character's relationship to his case is complex; the supporting cast are also great, and the sense of a life wasted, in part, because the hero's boldness in his job is not matched by a similar confidence in matters of the heart is well conveyed. The film is also superbly shot, there's a sequence filmed in a football stadium where the use of the camera to exploit the venue is frankly brilliant. Overall, I think that Bielinski's films with Darin were even better, but they also set a high bar; but 'The Secret in Their Eyes' certainly confirms his uncanny ability to shamble onto the screen and steal it completely.",9,3,4,6 August 2010
The Fifth Element," Flash Gordon in the late 1990s!
","For the first few minutes of this film, you may believe you are watching an earnest, but desperately hammy, sci-fi thriller.  Thankfully, this impression is soon dispelled. 'The Fifth Element' is simply the most pure comic-book creation on celluloid since Flash Gordon, taking from that medium not just the tedious plotting and flimsy scenarios of most examples of this genre, but also a spirit of vivid, and visual, comic imagination.  This is not a serious movie.  But it is inventive, frequently funny and has a sly satirical sense reminiscent of 'The Hitch Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy'. Certainly better than 'Men In Black'.",7,0,1,21 December 2003
127 Hours," Rock around the clock
","'Touching the Void' and 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' are two of the great stories of wilderness adventures gone wrong. But whereas the former was always going to make a great film, the latter (the inspiration for '127 hours') is more problematic, because of the static nature of the tale (basically, a man gets trapped beneath a rock). However, the Utah scenery is gorgeous, James Franco is note perfect as the initially rather arrogant young man who has the courage not to die, and director Danny Boyle, whose films I don't always admire, makes a good fist at finding cinematic ways to chart his protagonist's increasingly desperate state of mind. Almost inevitably, though, as a film about being stuck, it drags a little, before it's amazing, horrific yet wonderful end.",8,0,1,25 January 2012
Finding Nemo," Vanilla Pixar
","Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult.",6,0,1,18 February 2014
The Others," Works hard, but worth it in the end
","Alejandro Amenabar's film 'The Others' is in some senses a straightforward copy of 'The Sixth Sense' (with a nod to 'The Shining' added in for good measure). We are introduced to characters who bear witness to ghosts but whose own life is strangely disconnected from the world around them: the punchline is that they themselves are among the dead, only they have not yet acknowledged it. The formal structure of this revelation is more satisfying in 'The Others', it's still well signposted but there's a symmetry in the relationship between the ghosts and the living that is shocking and pleasing at the same time. The film also lacks the pompousness of M. Night Shyalaman's film, and works as a genuinely creepy horror movie despite almost the complete absence of special effects. What doesn't quite work is Nicole Kidman's central character, the woman who is dead but doesn't know it: her behaviour when she (and we) believe she is still living is apparently so batty that it's hard to relate to the story; while the eventual role reversal is handled with great skill, the earlier form of the tale (an apparently conventional ghost story) works far less well (for reasons that we eventually understand when the tables are turned). In consequence, I would say this is a genuinely spine-tingling movie with a great ending; but not a great movie overall, one that seems less silly in retrospect than it does when you're actually watching it. Both it and 'The Sixth Sense' demonstrate that this sort of trickery can work if handled with sufficient skill, but neither film completely succeeds in hiding the forcing of the plot needed to make it happen.",8,0,1,2 April 2006
Dead Poets Society," Dead Portents Society
","Any film about any sort of greatness faces one particular challenge: how to depict that greatness. For example, to write a great film about a great poet, would you also need to be able to write great poetry? In fact, 'Dead Poets Society ' is a film about not a great poet, but an (allegedly) great teacher (Keating, played by Robin Williams), but the problem is still the same: can you convince the viewer that your character is truly inspiring, and not just irritating? But the fact that I am unimpressed with the teaching methods of the film's hero is only the first of a number of problems I have with this movie. Another is that the hero urges his students to seize the day, and to make the most of their lives, but all he seems to have done with his own life is to become a teacher to some of America's most privileged schoolboys. The generally unfair phrase, 'those who can, do; those who can't, teach' actually seems apt in this case. And why should the audience care so much whether these boys, already blessed with every advantage, are inspired to achieve even more than than they would be otherwise? Then there's the issue about how they are actually inspired. All we see happen is a group of exceptionally docile teenagers acquire one quarter the rebelliousness, but ten times the pretentiousness, of any normal adolescent: yet we're apparently supposed to take this as an event of great import. Then one of the boys commits suicide for reasons that bear no relationship to anything that is consistent with modern psychological theories of suicide (that suicide is a symptom of mental illness: but here the character kills himself while of completely sound mind). Finally, the end of the film has echoes of Spartacus but in ludicrously less significant circumstances: are we really meant to be so upset that (however unjustly) a teacher has been sacked from his job? And it maybe doesn't even seem so unjust, not that he is really responsible for the death, but because the film has never shown him teach his classes anything but attitude; and moreover, we see him teaching only a single class in the entire movie, so there's never any sense of his wider life in the school. Director Peter Wier manages the whole piece with the same sort of stylised, refined sensibility also present in his 'Picnic At Hanging Rock'; but at times this seems ludicrous, such as when the class watches a pretty amateur performance of 'A Midsummers Nights Dream' with something close to rapture. In conclusion, this is an irksome film, whose unsubtle message is 'think for yourself', but which doesn't actually leave the audience much freedom to do this for themselves.",5,24,50,25 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Wide skies, deep closet
","Ang Lee's story of gay cowboys, their lives ruined by prejudice won many Oscars, and it's a sensitive treatment that shows how the way we think is governed by the environment we live in. And yet... am I the only person to find that there's something faintly ridiculous about the whole story, it's humourless solidity of terse, emotionally stilted men who turn to each other when, to be frank, it's either him or the sheep? While it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't translate 'gay' as 'camp', this is a portrait of people buried so deep in the closet that they can't see even the faintest crack of light; who, as the film shows it, when they do spend time together, simply sit out under the stars not talking to each other. In some ways, the film does not so much reject myth as blend the stereotype of the western hero with with the conventionally incompatible idea of homosexuality. Real life can hurt, but it's rarely this solemn; and the plot goes nowhere after the premise is established. None of this makes 'Brokeback Mountain' a bad movie; but it is strainingly earnest at times.",6,1,7,16 September 2008
Insomnia," Less tricksy then Momento, but as good
","Director Christopher Nolan re-invented the thriller genre when, in his film 'Momento', he told the story backwards. 'Insomnia', his follow-up movie, is less tricksy and covers some fairly familiar ground: corrupt cop, pretty female assistant, manipulative psychopath, horrific murder - none of this is especially new territory for film. But in spite of this, 'Insomnia' is every bit as gripping as its predecessor, thanks to some economical storytelling, Al Pacino playing ravaged as only Al Pacino can, the backdrop of some stunning but savage Alaskan scenery, but above all else, through Nolan's wonderfully taut and claustrophobic direction. Some scenes (the chases in the fog, and on the logs) are pure cliché, yet in Nolan's hands they come alive in a way that they fail to do nine times out of ten. Nolan is a clearly a major talent, and with this film, he has proved himself not just an imaginative young tyro, but also one capable of working with a serious budget and major stars. For all the obviousness of the premise, this movie shows how this sort of thriller ought to be done.",9,0,0,27 August 2007
Juno," Hip and shallow
","This well-reviewed film left me somewhat cold. It's a pleasant enough comedy about teenage pregnancy, with some whippy lines; but none of them really cut very hard. There's a drippy soundtrack, a geeky guy who the smart-alec girl eventually falls for (note that you very see films that work the other way around), and a fairly shallow portrait of emotional and family life. Director Reitman previously made 'Thank You For Smoking', which was right-wing and facetious, but which at least tried to make you think: this movie is frankly soft by comparison. Even one-liners are funniest when they come from the heart; but although the characters talk about heartbreak, none of them act like they know what it means.",6,2,9,24 December 2010
L.A. Confidential," A darker shade of noir
","Three bad cops, each repugnant in their own ways: these are the central characters of James Ellroy's 'L.A. Confidential', a gem of a book for those who like their thrillers ultra-tough and equally byzantine. If Ellroy has a weakness, it's a tendency to excess, both in tone and in plotting. Part of the reason Curtis Hanson's film of the novel is quite so entertaining is that he makes two spot on choices. Firstly, the mood of his movie is two parts hard-boiled realism to one part cartoon, which perfectly matches the book. Secondly, the greatest meanderings of the labyrinthine story are pared down, without sacrificing the complex essence (and essential complexity) of the tale. He also gets a string of great performances from his stars, hamming it up just enough but never too far: Russell Crowe does his usual meat-head with a heart role, Kim Basinger plays a femme fatale but most enjoyable is the double act of Danny de Vito and Kevin Spacey. James Cromwell is also good, although he seems confused as to whether he is Irish or Welsh! The result is utterly gripping and enormous fun, but it's no 'French Connection': ultimately, the film is far kinder on its violent hero Bud White (Crowe) than that other film is on Popeye Doyle, and the good versus bad ending is more conventional than the first two thirds of the film (or indeed, than the book's own, more confused, conclusion). But it's still a show of the highest class.",9,1,3,21 December 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The never-ending story
","I actually enjoyed the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean', with its hilarious account of Captain Jack Sparrow, the world's worst pirate. For sure, there was an element of fantasy in the story, but only in the sense that in the world of the film, all the old sea-farers' tales were actually true. But Hollywood loves a sequel (or three) and so we come to this monstrosity, a film characterised by preposterous metaphysics, an un-followable plot, bewildering computerised animation and unendurable length. It's a sign of the film's self-indulgence that Sparrow, its best character, doesn't even appear in the first half-hour; while every supposedly moving moment could have been cut and pasted from any other blockbuster. It seems that Hollywood must kill the things it loves; usually through an overcooking process that takes away whatever made an original film good and replaces it with pointless, generic bombast. If there's a metaphorical black flag flying over this film, it's sadly not a pirate one.",4,1,2,2 May 2012
X-Men," Not X-traordinary, but better than average
","'X-Men' has much to commend it compared with the average comic book flick. There's a star director in the form of Bryan Singer, and excellent performances from veteran British actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Although McKellan plays a villain, he also draws sympathy to his character, which is also unusual in a film of this type.  Above all, there's an uncommonly interesting scenario.  The original comic book was apparently inspired by the civil rights struggle in the U.S.A., and in the film version, there's also a hint of the McCarthy era.  Ordinary human beings, far from being portrayed in an attractive manner, are shown as weak, small minded bigots who might vote for George Bush or read the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, a civil was erupts among the mutants they persecute, one faction (Stewart's) committed to peace, the other (McKellan's) convinced that co-existence with humans is no longer possible, and ready to fight all those who stand in their way.Against this, there are a few negatives.  The acting of the attractive characters who play the young X-men is wooden (or, more appropriately, metallic) compared with that of their elders.  The expensive special effects are also slightly cumbersome, they feel like inserted sequences.  'The Matrix' may have been empty-headed, but it set new standards for integrating computer-generated animation into the entire world of the film, and 'X-Men' rates poorly by comparison.  Also, the possibility that McKellan might be right is never acknowledged by the film.  We're allowed to accept that he is genuine, but not that his chilling analysis may yet be correct.  And finally the plot is a 'by-numbers' affair.  Neophytes are inducted by a master, only for the master to become incapacitated leaving the newcomers to fend for themselves, before a happy (and sequel-setting) ending - exactly the same as 'The Matrix', in fact.Better by far than the average blockbuster, 'X-Men' doesn't quite live up to it's potential.  But there's more food for thought here than in most films of its ilk.",6,5,10,24 October 2003
A Bridge Too Far," A convincing portrait of war
","'A Bridge Too Far' is the story of a British military disaster from the later stages of World War Two, made in 1977 (at sufficient distance from the war to enable a nuanced view of the conflict). In essence, it's a conventional war movie, made on a lavish scale and with an (over?) starry cast, e.g. Gene Hackman's turn as a Polish officer is not perhaps the most convincing performance of his career. More generally, there's little casting against type, either in terms of the actors on in terms of Hollywood racial clichés: the English upper class bear most of the guilt while heroic Scots and Americans are the lions led by donkeys. What is good about the movie is it's attempt to seriously detail the full course of a complex battle; and some of the set piece scenes (such as the parachute drops) are impressive for a film made before computer animation was available, although I found the score a little too directive. Overall, the movie is perhaps too fictionalised to work as documentary, but too broad in scope to satisfy in the way of the best fiction. But it convinces as a portrait of what this war must really have been like for those who had to fight it.",7,2,4,19 August 2008
Zodiac," Police reconstruction
","'Zodiac' is David Fincher's film about a long-running police investigation into an uncaught serial killer. The film's central character is a newspaper cartoonist who (in real life, as in the movie) became obsessed with the case; but the film follows the full, convoluted investigative procedure. Fincher is certainly a skilled director, although sometimes the film appears to be presenting (in its background music and stories) a sketch-by-numbers account of recent history. More problematic is its lack of focus: most characters are only briefly in the spotlight, and the lack of both resolution (and continuing murders) eventually diffuses interest: another year, another clue, but the (instinctively realistic, and in fact accurate) lack of resolution reminds one why thrillers tend to go for implausible melodramatic conclusions. This isn't quite a detective film, a killer-thriller, or even a straightforward movie about obsession: credit should be given to Fincher for not staying within the straight-jacket of a single narrow convention, but at times, it feels more like police reconstruction than drama.",7,0,1,14 April 2013
The Prestige," Sumptuous, intriguing, but flat characterisation
","Christopher Nolan's sumptuous film, 'The Prestige', tells the story of two warring magicians, each obsessed with each other's trick. The film cleverly uses its subject matter to create a mystery story; and as with all magic tricks, the question as to what is real remains open until the very end. There's even an inventive walk-on part for Nikolai Tesla, the real life creator of the alternating current. The film has weaknesses - in some ways, the two magicians are two similar, I wasn't enamoured of Christian Bale's performance, and perhaps at the end, more could have been made of the fundamental difference between true magic and a trick - the film explains (at least partly), but there's a certain lack of moral resonance. But like all good shows, it lures you in - and the longer you watch, the more you want to find out what's really going on.",8,1,4,2 March 2011
Hotel Rwanda," More questions than answers
","The west's terrible neglect of the Rwandan genocide is to our shame; but how did it happen? 'Hotel Rwanda' deserves credit for bringing this wrongly-ignored tragedy to our attention, albeit long after the killing; but it fails to really answer the question. A smooth, urbane hotel manager suddenly finds that half the country wants to kill the other half, and ends up trying to protect as many of his fellow citizens as follows. But the murderous violence comes out of nowhere, and perhaps cannot be truly understood through the perspective of a westernised member of the middle classes; and the widespread nature of the terror (a million people were killed in all) is not really captured. Although it's quite normal to personalise a story that seems too large to tell completely (think 'Schindler's List' for an obvious example), I found it hard to get a true sense of the wider society of which the hotel is supposed to be a microcosm (just as the one heroic U.N. officer we see appears equally without a context of his own). So while it's good this film was made, I found it only somewhat illuminating; though it also made me ponder how shamefully rarely black Africa is chosen as a subject for any sort of film.",5,1,3,7 February 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not bad, but not progress
","I wouldn't recommend reading all John Le Carre's books - they can be a bit same-y - but 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', about the uncovering of a mole within the British intelligence services, is a perfectly judged thriller, a spy-cum-detective story set against the backdrop of perceived national decline. The book was also the basis of one of the greatest television series of all time, perhaps owing to the fact that this is an ensemble story, allowing a collection of some of the finest British character actors of their generation to play off each other. Alec Guinness's portrayal of retired secret agent George Smiley is widely considered to have been his finest role; but arguably, Ian Richardson and Michael Aldridge also gave us their best stuff in this series. So one attraction of a remake, this time as a movie, is that it gives another generation of actors the chance to shine. But one question is, what can the film add to what the book and television series have already done? And while the movie doesn't butcher the source material, I fear the answer is not much. Of course, it's hard for a fan of the earlier work to watch with neutral eyes. Where the casting seems consistent with that used previously (John Hurt as Control, for example) everything feels fine; where not (Kathy Burke as Connie) it just feels wrong. More objectively, one can say that the inevitably more compressed format loses retains the mood of the original but loses the broader focus on the whole range of protagonists; when the mole is finally revealed, we care less because we know less about him. One can also note that in places the script departs from the book unnecessarily, but with the effect of losing subtlety and also plausibility: there's no reason for Irina to be shot in front of Prideaux, for Smiley to catch his wife in flagrante, or indeed, for Smiley to take a gun to his meeting with the mole, except to ram home a point that was better left implied. The soundtrack is also peculiarly deployed and contrasts with the unbeatable opening music and introductory credits of its predecessor. This doesn't make this a bad film; but if you watch just one version, pick the other one.",7,0,0,19 April 2015
"I, Tonya"," Entertaining but lazy
","The story of Tonya Harding is an amazing one. A figure-skater whose face and image didn't fit her chosen sport's, she nonetheless had a pretty decent career; but one which ended in extreme controversy when she was implicated in a plot to injure one of her leading rivals. It's a story of someone doubly disadvantaged by their background: Tonya faced prejudice, but that's not to say she wasn't carrying real baggage as well, in the form of the various unsuitable acquaintances of hers involved in the assault. Unfortunately, 'I, Tonya' is a rather lazy film, with a clumsy and unsubtle description of American 'white trash', an unimaginative soundtrack comprising a semi-random assemblage of pop hits, and a treatment of the story as essentially comic. It ends with a ludicrous court scene in which Tonya is banned from competition as part of her criminal sentence. It's a shame, because you're left with the feeling that there's certainly a story worth telling in here; but this feels no more sophisticated than a cartoon.",6,3,5,13 April 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Understatted and Entertaining
","Robert Redford made a number of films for director George Roy Hill in the late 1960s/early 1970s, two of them (this film, and 'The Sting') with fellow mega-star Paul Newman. Unlike 'The Sting', 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' ambles along with no particular regard to plot structure. These days, films are made faster and tauter than this, and the slow pace sometimes frustrates (especially during the dated, Burt Baccarach musical numbers); but it also has benefits, maximising the low key humour of the script which would surely fail if the pace was forced. I'm not so certain about Redfrod's casting, however: 'The Kid' is actually something of a grizzled character, and Redford arguably plays best as the fresh-faced young innocent: the moustache he wears gives the impression of concealing a permanent smirk. But the film is very easy to watch in spite of this, and is consistently entertaining, even if it lacks 'The Sting's sheer vitality.",7,0,2,23 April 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Answering to the Coca-Cola Company...
","The eponymous Dr. Strangelove is in fact just a minor character in the film that bears his name; and moreover, one of three characters played by Peter Sellars in Stanley Kubrick's celebrated cold war satire. And justly celebrated, because this is a very funny movie, quite aside from being a disturbingly plausible story. What it isn't so good at is maintaining an air of tension: as the countdown to nuclear oblivion takes place, it's hard to really believe in the story unfolding as anything more than a set-up for the gags, and of course the special effects are predictably rubbish by modern standards. It's arguable this is a good thing, forcing the writers to rely on their script. One particular point struck me: just how much the paranoid general reminded me of the tea-partiers in modern day America. But perhaps it's just a mark of top-class satire that it retains a feeling of pertinence, even when the mood of the times has superficially changed.",8,0,3,21 April 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," Simplistic but powerful
","Guillermo del Toro's film, 'Pan's Labyrinth', is a magic realist movie, in which a young girl, living amid bloody and persistent rebellion following the official end of the Spanish Civil War, takes refuge in a fantasy world. The film has a moral viewpoint that plainly divides the world into good and evil, and as with most stories based on fantasy, there's a certain arbitrariness to some of the plot. But it also has an epic feel, and a certain poetic grandeur, and manages to pull off its mixture of realism and make-believe without descending into silliness. There are other films that better capture the ambiguity of internal conflict; but this is still a movie of originality and power.",8,1,6,27 January 2009
The Way Back," Long walk to freedom
","At the end of '1984', Winston Smith loves Big Brother. And in a documentary I saw about prison camps in Siberia, the grizzled veterans confessed that, when they learnt that Stalin had died, they cried. So my first quibble with Peter Weir's film (based on an extraordinary real life escape from such a camp) is that it conveys absolutely nothing of such psychology. The prisoners denounce Stalinism, and protest their lack of freedom, in a way that seems to better reflect modern sensitivities than the actual reality of life in the camps. Things don't get that much better once the escape is underway. To me, at least, the interesting thing about the story is logistics: how does anyone manage to live as a fugitive for months in the depths of Siberia? But I don't really get a sense of how they did it from the movie, which conveys that the men were short of food and water but presents these challenges almost in the abstract, rather than showing us the everyday discipline that allowed their ultimate survival. The film is not completely awful, yet somehow, it didn't come alive for me, unlike some books I have read about life in the camps which brought their particularities to vivid life. The story here seems more generic, and consequently, less interesting.",6,1,2,1 January 2014
Capote," The cult of the 'writer'
","'In Cold Blood', Truman Capote's most famous book, was a thinly fictionalised account of some real life murders; which he befriended the killers to write. 'Capote' tells the story of the book's gestation. At its dramatic core is the tension between Capote the professional, to whom his subjects are just material, and Capote the human being; to be a writer, of course, he needs to function on both levels. But nonetheless, the film presents him as someone so fundamentally self-centred that it's hard to see why we should care about his ethical unease - there's little doubt that ultimately he's going to resolve it in his own favour anyway. Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in the title role but there really doesn't seem to be too much purpose to this movie, except to genuflect in reverence of the 'artist'.",5,1,3,19 March 2017
Life of Pi," Cinema and metaphor
","'Life of Pi' tells an amazing story of a boy who survives a shipwreck after being marooned on a raft with a tiger for company. With what is either remarkable computer graphics or a remarkable feat of animal training, the film version of Yann Martel's novel is certainly an entertaining watch, even if the tale seems unbelievable. The conclusion invites us to conceive of the story not as literal truth, but as metaphor, for events perhaps too bleak to remember without disguise. Although I haven't read the book, my guess is that the reader's shifting understanding of the narrative is crucial: the film struggles a bit, if only because film always struggles with imaginative metaphor, rendering everything with concrete reality. Film has the power to show us impossible things as fact; it's thus a tricky medium when the point of the story is, in part, that impossible things are indeed impossible. So I enjoyed the movie; but I wonder if the book might not have better handled the uncertain nature of its truth.",7,0,0,23 September 2017
Lost in Translation," Brief Encounter
","'Lost in Translation' is almost like a modern version of 'Brief Encounter': two lonely people meet, and fail to have sex. And if the absence of (implied) sex made David lean's film unusual, then 'Lost in Translation' is even more of an oddity, in today's hyper-sexualised world (and especially in the hyper-hyper sexualised world of the movies). But there are some differences: train travel has been replaced by plane travel (although distance from home is a key part of both films), there's a lower key feel (no romantic music) and, most crucially, the element of tragedy is missing. In 'Brief Encounter', the sense was that the two protagonists really should have had a wild affair; in Lost in Translation', by contrast, although they could have had an affair, there's no sense that their lives would actually have been enhanced by doing so: they're world-weary rather than repressed, even at Scarlett Johansson's tender age. And for me, this took the sting out of the story: it was hard to invest anything emotional in the plot, because the plot's self-evident point was that it wasn't going to go anywhere. The connection of the protagonists wasn't even very deep. Perhaps it felt just too like real, every-day modern life to me (except for the wealth and beauty of its characters). I spend a lot of time travelling, some of it lonely, making brief but essentially insignificant connections. I don't expect anyone to make a film about me! Beyond that, the movie takes a few liberties in inaccurately merging the sense of alienation that comes from being abroad with the very different sense of alienation that comes from staying in a five-star hotel; but that's forgivable, and I like the indirect way that the movie depicts their experiences. Bill Murray deadpans his way through the story skillfully but neither of the two lead characters appears to possess any notable qualities, beyond being alone and in Japan. And while I actually liked this film; I failed to discover its stand out qualities also.",7,4,8,8 May 2007
Empire of the Sun," Malkovich great, not so sure about the rest
","'Empire of the Sun', J.B. Ballard's semi-autobiographical story of growing up in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, is one of his most conventional novels. In Steven Spielberg's hands, however, it becomes a movie that suffers from intrusive music and a certain absence of subtlety. Ballard's books are often heavy on symbolism; but this unfortunately translates into a certain heavy-handedness on film. The best thing in it is John Malkovich , who plays the enigmatically villainous Basie, a far more interesting character than Christian Bale's hero whose perpetual naiveté never quite convinces. If it wasn't quite so long, I might have enjoyed it a little more.",6,2,12,22 July 2006
Glory," Glorification and simplicity
","The American civil war was fought against slavery, but specifically because northern businessmen feared the hegemony of their slave-owning southern counterparts; Lincoln's conversion to the doctrine of universal human rights was an emergent, and controversial, feature of the conflict. A drama about the first black regiment to fight in the war is therefore potentially rife with intriguing ambiguity; unfortunately, 'Glory' prefers to portray the regiment (and it's saintly white commander) as straightforward heroes, and the drama proceeds without much subtlety. The soundtrack in the closing sections, with its choral overtones, is used to underscore the simplistic take home message; while the acting and writing has a two-dimensional quality throughout. A shame, as I'm sure there's an interesting tale in this story; but this rendition is obvious and dull.",5,7,24,18 October 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the drones
","A long time ago, in a galaxy not a million miles away from our own, Geroge Lucas made 'Star Wars'. Optimisitcally subtitled 'A New Hope', the film was an old fashioned, good-versus evil, rollicking adventure, with a cracking storyline and groundbreaking special effects. The huge success of the movie is widely believed today to have had a massive impact on Hollywood as a whole; but in a more local context, a direct consequence was the release of two sequels (though Lucas left the direction of these to others). Sequel number one, 'The Empire Strikes Back', added a layer of darkness to the story, but also a layer of pretension, and the episodic plot seemed to do little more than occupy the space between the first film and the third. And by the time of number three ('The Return of the Jedi'), it appeared that the concept was running out of steam; although still a huge box-office success, nothing new was offered to the audience except the abominably cuddly Ewoks. Even more worrying was that Lucas seemed prouder of the Ewoks than he was of the movie, and he was to spend some effort in the subsequent years attempting to promote them as the future of family entertainment. 'Star Wars', however, was placed firmly on the back-burner, and vaguely mentioned plans for three promised 'prequels' appeared to be buried.But eventually, in the late 1990s, Lucas became sufficiently enamoured of technological advances to be lured back to those prequels, newly confident he could make a film that would outdo the originals. Such had been the cultural impact of the 'Star Wars' phenomenon, that expectations could not have been higher; but film four (or episode one, to consider things chronologically) failed to meet those near impossible hopes. Lucas tried to keep the attention of his old fans (by now, really quite old fans) by adding a layer of political intrigue; but unfortunately, this proved vague and dull. While he attempted to bring in a younger audience though the creation of a 'lovable' wholly computer-animated character,the insanely annoying Jar-Jar Binks. For all the brickbats, 'The Phantom Menace' is probably not quite as bad as its critical reception; those steeped in Star Wars lore can sit back and enjoy a movie much of which is comparable in quality at least to the 'Return of the Jedi'. But whereas the earlier films had broken new ground, the grimy, vicious world of 'The Matrix', released in the same year, only seemed to show how dated and cutesy Lucas's own vision had become.Lucas ploughed on with his fifth film, 'Attack of the Clones', and essentially it's more of the same. Thenkfully, there's less of Jar-Jar, and there's also the interesting spectacle of Ewan MacGregor growing into the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a role immortalised in the first film by the late Alec Guinesss; he does rather well, in fact, although if anything he appears a trifle too camp. But the movie's younger stars, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, are desperately dull and wooden (although to be fair, the script gives them little to work with). Also bizarre is Lucas's increasing determination to show us his galaxy as an inter-racial melting pot resembling a prejudicial distortion of New York City. In spite of this, I quite enjoyed the beginning of the film, but it ends (just like 'The Phantom Menace') in a wild orgy of special effects. Whereas in the original, each explosion was a thing of beauty, here we have thousands per scene, pure visual mayhem (and utterly pointless). The sense that this film needed an editor is emphasised by the fact that the best visual trick is still the light sabre, now over 20 years old, and it's when the characters fight at a human pace that the audience is able to invest some belief and passion in them. Otherwsie, what's amazing about this film is how little excitement the endless battle scenes actually induce, for all the expense that they must have cost to make.A few final points. The enemy are clones and droids, presumably because if this many humans were shown being killed, the film would never have received its certificates. Secondly, I saw it on video, one which bizarrely chooses to begin with a short extra film summarising all five movies (including the one we're about to watch), which only goes to show how 'Star Wars' exists in a parallel universe, separate from all other movies. And thirdly, a minor continuity error: how come C-3PO, in 'A New Hope', fails to recognise that fate has returned him to the very same farm (and owners) where, we now learn, he once had lived? One thing's for certain: it's almost impossible to make sense of the fact that George Lucas is the same man who made 'American Graffiti', although, dare I say it, that was another film that could have used a few cuts.",5,2,5,8 June 2005
Romeo + Juliet," It's just that the time was... right!
","For all the Shakespeare's greatness, filming the bard's works presents problems, owing to the static staging, the need for the cast to act unsubtly to convey the meaning of outdated language, and subject matter not obviously attuned to modern life.  The last problem is in fact a mirage, as beneath the surface concerns of his works, Shakespeare addresses universal themes, which is why many have tried to update his plays for modern times: but a straightforward modernisation misses the point that it is the language they contain, rather than their generic and contrived plotting, that makes them great in the first place.  Director Baz Luhrmann therefore tried a different strategy: change the style but keep the words.  So his 'Romeo + Juliet' is set in an apocalyptic hybrid of Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, and filmed as a cross between 'Dynasty' and a pop video, but retains all the original poetry.  The lurid result is surprisingly fresh, and huge amounts of imaginative fun are had in translation (my favourite details: the depiction of the clans' fathers, one as Ted Kennedy and one as a mafioso; the use of the swimming pool in the famous balcony scenes; and Romeo's exile as a hippy in the desert).  Some of this interpretation is over the top, but there's more hit than miss and even Mercutio (played by Harold Pirreneau as a drag queen) brings real passion to his death. As for the stars, Leonardo di Caprio, an actor of limited range, is well suited to this role, while Claire Danes smiles fluourescently and speaks the centuries-old dialgoue with the saucy naturalness of the contemporary American teenager. The tricksiness fades towards the end as Luhrmann concentrates on the intrinsic drama; but never do you feel like you are watching a play.  In conclusion: Shakespeare still rocks, and Luhrmann does too.",9,1,2,18 August 2004
Gone Baby Gone," Promising, but ruined by clichés and silliness
","'Gone Baby Gone' starts off as a tough urban thriller. If its protagonists seem too young and beautiful to be genuine private detectives, and too refined to be pistol-whipping gangsters, there are some original elements in the story. But then, the original tale concludes surprisingly early; and what follows are progressively more unlikely developments including vigilantism, a police-led conspiracy, and the discovery of said conspiracy by the hero. What's worse, the drama shifts from being led by plot, to character (only the lead characters are not so interesting), and then to issues (although the 'issue' here is the almost impossible one of what society should do with bad parents; although there is surely no useful solution to the problem if the question is framed in this way). To be frank, the end result is more silly than tough.",Null,0,2,7 August 2011
"Monsters, Inc."," Lively and fun
","'Monsters Inc.' is a Disney (or at least, a Pixar) film. Which means one has a corporate satire made by one of the world's most powerful corporations; and a tale where two friends (one talkative, one cute) argue but always get together in the end to ensure that everyone lives happily ever after. If the template is familiar, the film also marked a move away from the realistic animation of 'Toy Story' (the first wave of computer animation) back towards something more obviously cartoony. It also lacks 'Toy Story's bleak undercurrents, but it's generally fun and inventive, even if you can spot the end coming a long way off. As an adult, I don't quite buy the idea that Pixar's films are the greatest of all time; but there's no denying that they do what they do well.",7,0,1,21 January 2011
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones's dreary
","In the early 1990s, British newspapers were suddenly filled with columns written by journalists suffering from the arrogant delusion that their own lives were an subject matter of interest to their readers; journalists who often, with a startling lack of awareness, expressed shock and surprise when some of those they ridiculed in their articles (spouses, friends, etc.) took public offence. In response Sue Limb started writing the 'Dulcie Domum' column in 'The Guardian', an entertaining spoof whose fictional author was a struggling writer, whose limited understanding of the implications of their own words was the best part of the joke. 'Helen Fielding's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' came later in 'The Independent', but was very much in a similar vein.In both columns, the terse style of a diary was used to invoke images of complete catastrophe in a minimum of words. Arguably, both belonged to a tradition started not in newspapers at all but by Sue Townsend in her 'Adrian Mole' books a number of years before. 'Bridget Jones', of course, had much more success than 'Dulcie Domum', although the writing was actually less good. But its subject matter, that of a thirty-something woman looking for love, had more resonance, I like to think because the concept was implemented with some subtlety. Bridget was a woman with deeply ambiguous feelings towards the romantic dream (of getting married, having kids etc.) that seemed to have passed her by; but was also a woman with little self-confidence whose erratic mood and behavioural swings owed much to her inability to handle the knowledge that she'd failed to fit the only approved template for a woman's life. The hidden tragedy was that if only she could think more of herself, she might find her life (disasters included) was actually not so bad. The column thus sympathised with Bridget, laughed at her, but contained also a degree of feminist anger at the way social values can on occasion reduce even highly competent women to states of emotional imbicility. But popularity brought popularisation: a move to 'The Daily Telegraph', then to hard covers and finally to celluloid.And the load of witless drivel that is this film.The original idea has here been reduced to a sub-Austen story about a beautiful but utterly ditzy idiot (with an apparent mental age of about thirteen) appearing in lots of sitcom-inspired moments of excruciating embarrassment, and falling in love at the same time. In many respects, the film character is the sort of person the original Bridget might have feared (when at her lowest ebb) she would become if she didn't find a man: a recognisable caricature of herself, but not the same thing at all. The essential angst of Bridget's condition is not dwelt on at all (the original was reliably single except for occasional one night stands, the film version claims to be afraid of being left alone but actually has no shortage of chasing men); while the dry comments of the diary, instead of inspiring the imagination as they did in the columns, in the film simply underscore already obvious incidents (the use of pop music to re-enforce every other point is also crass). Meanwhile, the overall direction of the plot is telegraphed from the start. American Renee Zwelleger manages of British accent of sorts, but her social class is wrong (she sounds far too posh): indeed, the essentially middle class dreariness of the original Bridget's life is traded for something altogether more glamorous (and fake). The film also invites us to accept her self-assessment as 'fat' as face-value (it's true she fattened up for the role, but this tells us nothing except the perverse standards of actresses).'Bridget Jones Diary' is romance for teenagers (the smutty, unfunny jokes and exaggerated swearing also confirm this). Incidentally, a new report out last week said there are far more single men than woman in Bridget's age bracket. But there's no market, I guess, for films that encourage men to do themselves down and identify with characters as juvenile as the Bridget who is represented here. The implications of that statement are even more depressing than this monotone film.",3,6,12,14 November 2004
American Hustle," Entertaining, but so predictable
","'American Hustle' tells the story of a pair of con-men induced to help the FBI trap some bigger fish, a shaggy dog story told mostly straight and with some genuinely funny moments. It also features explanatory voice-overs, a heavy (1970s) period soundtrack and a final twist I found underwhelming, to say the least, first of all because if you've seen any conman movies before, the double-cross is only to be expected, but secondly because the film is so obviously playing for entertainment, and makes little attempt to lure the viewer into the trap. And indeed it is entertaining, albeit in a rather predictable way - but it falls well short of the standard of Mamet's 'House of Games', or even 'The Sting'.",7,1,2,17 April 2017
The Godfather: Part II," More family business
","Marlon Brando plays no part in this sequel to 'The Godfather', but Al Pacino is still on hand, playing his son, and Robert de Nero joins the cast playing the Godfather's younger self. The two films together can thus be seen as representing the passing of a torch from the best actor of one generation to two of the best of the next. And it's amazing to see how fully the two youngsters come to inhabit their roles, and how fresh their portrayals are. The chronology of the story means they share no screen time; but when they eventually did come together on celluloid, over twenty years later in Michael Mann's 'Heat', they appeared as clapped-out, over-acting, stereotypes of themselves - whereas here they simply play their parts, to perfection. Pacino especially is good (while de Nero attempts to impersonate Brando); while among the supporting cast John Cazale (who also co-starred with Pacino in 'Dog Day Afternoon') is also exceptional . The film shares other virtues with its predecessor: a stately pace, but masterful directing ensuring that the film never bores; and a great, haunting score. However, I don't quite find this film the equal of its predecessor: it lacks a bit of focus in comparison. The two stories (of the Godfather's early years, and his son's later ones), do not fit seamlessly and the second, major story is too political, lacking the visceral impact of the story told in 'The Godfather Part One'; while the other story is simpler, but almost not political enough. A third story, maybe more interesting (how the Corleones got rich, presumably under prohibition) is not covered at all. In summary, for all the plaudits given to this film, I don't feel it adds that much to its predecessor; but it's still a film of the highest quality, and another reminder (if needed) of quite how good an actor the young Pacino was.",8,0,1,2 February 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bond without the baggage
","The series of films featuring the character of Jason Bourne can be thought of as a modern-day interpretation of James Bond, but without the baggage: they feature a cool super-agent, and lots of high-tech action scenes, but without the sexiness and silliness that have come to define the movies about the English spy. Indeed, one might even suggest that 'Casino Royale', the most recent Bond film, was at least half a nod in the direction of Bourne. The last two instalments of the Bourne series have been directed by Brit Paul Greengrass, who made his name with drama-documentaries; but here, he proves himself surprisingly adept at the action game. He shows a clear preference for high speed zooms and pounding music, devices to ratchet up the tension that normally I find merely irritating; but in 'The Bounre Ultimatum', there is sufficient action such that this way of highlighting it does not seem excessive, and I watched many of the sequences on the edge of my seat. In some ways, this is a textbook action film, so why the low rating? The answer lies in the way that the film also possesses all the textbook limitations of action movies, namely non-existent characterisation and little plot beyond 'lots of people want to kill Bourne, but can't'. Of the actors, Matt Damon does his job in the lead role, Julia Stiles is utterly implausible as a secret agent with permanently coiffured hair, Daid Strathearn's villainous C.I.A. agent is potentially more interesting but seems to exist purely to be outsmarted by Bourne at every turn. And the film is very watchable; but there's little here to remember.",5,0,1,12 December 2007
Fargo," Cold-hearted
","The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",7,55,76,13 April 2005
Rush," Less compelling than the real thing
","James Hunt and Nikki Lauda, rivals on the track in Formula One, were both born into wealthy backgrounds, had the attention of beautiful women, and were both very arrogant young men, albeit in different ways. You might think that a dramatic reconstruction of their careers might not seem very appealing; but you might also remember that the documentary 'Senna', about another talented, spoilt and arrogant young racer was actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Ron Howard's 'Rush' takes a simplistic approach to representing both the character of the two men and also the intricacies of racing, sometimes combining idiocies in both departments simultaneously (in the first race we see, Hunt is beating Lauda to some championship - the cumulation of a season's racing - without apparently even knowing who he is). You won't learn much about motor racing from this film, nor what makes a good driver, nor even much about the two men's characters beyond a tabloid characterisation. Even the track footage is strangely uncompelling.",5,1,3,22 June 2015
Notting Hill," Quality trowelmanship
","I didn't want to like 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', but in the end, I just couldn't help it. Writer Richard Curtis is a master of situation comedy, and although manipulative and sentimental, the film was constructed with sufficient skill to force one to care for the characters, even when one's head might have been telling one to vomit. 'Notting Hill' is virtually a retread of the same film: there's another Curtis script, Hugh Grant plays an Englishman falling for an unavailable American, lashings of soppy music and moments of poignancy. Unfortunately, it's obviously not as fresh as its predecessor, and moreover the essence of the earlier film has been not so much replicated, as distilled into something almost unbearably trite and false. Grant's character Thacker, for example, is almost a parody of the one he played previously; he lives in a Notting Hill that can be considered (depending on your perspective) either stylised or racially cleansed; and although (unlike in 'Four Weddings') we do actually see how he earns his living (as a cute, inefficient bookseller) this in no way accounts for the quality of his life (for example, he owns a main door flat in central Notting Hill, which is not the average abode of an impecunious shop owner). Indeed, whereas in the funeral scene of the earlier movie, we at least saw that not all of the characters necessarily lived in the manner their fancy wedding attire might have suggested, in 'Notting Hill' all the heroes are sympathetically unmaterialistic and yet none seem to in any way be strapped for cash; even when one loses their job, and another's business fails, there seem to be no negative consequences, and no-one envies anybody else's success, either. It's as if each character has to be given problems to make them seem human, vulnerable and sympathetic, but these problems are not in turn allowed to puncture the essentially idyllic set-up. The scene where one of Thacker's friends, who is beautiful but paralysed, half-laughs off her disability (able to do this because of the depth of her husband's love for her), really does make one reach for the sick bucket in its mawkish conceit.Yet Curtis is just so good as writing this rubbish that I find I can't hate this film either, even though I should. There are some very funny jokes (although some lines seem virtual copies of those in 'Four Weddings'), and the romance is played by all with infinitely more skill than in, say, 'Bridget Jones Diary' (which also had a Curtis script, but which was infinitely cruder in its execution). It may all be laid on with a trowel, but the trowelmanship is the best in its class. So I find I have to give this film seven out of ten. Oh, well. Maybe I'll manage to hate 'Love, actually'.",7,0,0,23 November 2005
Léon: The Professional," Has merits, but made me feel uneasy
","With it's soundtrack of Bjork and Sting, Luc Besson's film 'Leon' certainly reminds one of the early 1990s. The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since.",6,7,13,24 February 2010
Bohemian Rhapsody," Played 'Live Aid', then died
","Musical biographies often make for pretty poor films, even when the musician themselves has happened to have lived an interesting life. The coincidence of personal drama and creativity is often a loose one; attempting to forge a narrative, a certain sort of movie almost always take refuge in a ludicrous cathartic scene where the protagonist writes their love song while hurting from a break-up etc. etc. etc. 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the story of Queen, struggles even more because as an authorized project, it attempts to give some credit to every band member, which dampens its attempts to show their squabbling. In addition, it chooses a positive narrative, focusing not on lead singer Freddie Mercury's tragically early death but rather on Queen's triumphant performance, when it might have been thought they were over the hill, at the legendary 'Live Aid' concert a few years earlier. Comedian Spike Milligan used to quip that his obituary would read 'Wrote the Goon Show, then died'. Whatever you think of Queen, the band had a long string of imaginative hits, but watching this film, you might feel you could sum up Mercury's life as 'Played Live Aid, then died'. While many have focused on Rami Malek's performance in bringing Mercury to life, I struggled to avoid being distracted by the frankly painful screenplay. The one redeeming feature here is Queen's music, used liberally throughout but welcome nonetheless.",4,2,6,16 March 2019
American Pie," As conservative as apple pie
","The American high school, as depicted in modern comedy, is a strange place indeed: full of over-aged, foul mouthed jocks and sexy, self-aware young women and what's more, every one of them is affluent. In a country where many real schools have metal detectors on the doors to keep out firearms, it's a relentlessly aspirational world, which, for all the cruelty and anguish on display, the target teen-aged audience can dream that they belong to. In addition, for all the toilet humour, it's a profoundly conservative world as well. 'American Pie', for example, may set new lows (if that's how you want to consider them) in toilet humour, but fundamentally this is a film about the joys of belonging; belonging with your friends, your lovers, even belonging with your decidedly weird father. In this narrative, the fear of isolation is eventually banished through the mere possession of an essentially good heart. Real outsiders, if they appear at all, appear only as losers, virtually labelled as the child-abusers of the next generation in punishment for their failure to learn how to fit in.In fact, viewed in these terms, 'American Pie' is far from the most offensive film in it's genre, with a little less smug sanctimoniousness behind the smut than is usual in such fare. Unfortunately, it's just not that funny. The plot is simple: four guys try to get laid, and the absence of real narrative reduces the film to a series of set pieces devoid of real context. Even the eponymous pie gag isn't even particularly gross, and there's none of the offbeat charm of 'There's Something About Mary' (which aimed at a slightly older audience and which I found rather funnier than I like to admit). The success of films like this is all about selling a lifestyle: this is a film about how the average teenager might like to lose their virginity. Real life is darker, but also, often funnier as well.",3,3,6,2 June 2005
Burn After Reading," Droll but a bit pointless
","Personally, I'm not such a huge fan of films by the Coen brothers; but it's hard to deny that each time they make a film, it's a different one. 'Burn After Reading' is a riotous spy-thriller, a viciously black farce that in which one can see traces of the brothers' previous films (deadpan scenes echoing 'Fargo', but also some of the zaniness of 'Raising Arizona', for example) but which is far from just a remake of any of them. As always, there are moments at which you can't help but chuckle; and it's fun to see Brad Pitt and George Clooney in such unheroic roles, although John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton do most of the scene-stealing. But the script suffers from a surplus of unoriginal swearing and a standard flaw of many of the Coen's movies: there's no reason to care for any of the characters. It's inventive and in places amusing; but it's still a film lacking in heart.",7,1,3,24 April 2011
Watchmen," Too much material for one film
","'Watchmen', one of what sometimes seems like an interminable number of comic-book adaptations, is fundamentally a very strange film. On one hand, it's a straightforward superhero movie; on another, it's a neo-noir tale of an alternate world where that dangerous peacenik Richard Nixon has enjoyed decades of unbroken power and the world has been ruined by liberal conspiracy. On yet a third hand, it's an over-the-top (and half-baked) piece of science fiction fantasy of wild incoherence. Half of the superheroes in this film are just ordinary policemen and women wearing capes; one of the others transcends all laws of physics. Ultimately, this is a movie about style over substance, but its insane length makes no sense given it has so little integral meaning. I've never read the comic it was based on; but this is a self-important mess of a film.",4,3,8,1 December 2012
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon's European tour
","There's a nice idea at the heart of 'The Bourne Identity'; Matt Damon's amnesiac discovers a clue as to his identity, only to discover he has not one but many - he's apparently an undercover agent - so which one is the real him? Unfortunately, the film is not very interested in the true psychology of amnesia; Bourne is far too composed to be convincing for someone who has forgotten everything, and bizarrely, he is able to judge what he learns about himself as aberrant and strange (i.e. he remembers what he was not, and is thus able to compare what he discovers about himself (but has not remembered) to this, which makes little sense). The film has some other annoying features: the C.I.A. is represented as pure evil but also as near-omnipotent; the film is full of exaggerated fight and chase scenes that are less gripping than more realistic ones would be (for however action-packed, you can't help but feel you are watching a cartoon); and Julia Stiles keeps popping up for no reason whatsoever, as if the producers wanted her in the movie even though there is no role for her to play. But on the plus side, the production values are high, a selection of European locations make effective backdrops, the tension is maintained throughout and Franka Potente makes a sexy leading female. And some sequences, like the opening dissection of a wetsuit, are immaculately assembled. Ultimately, this is popcorn cinema, shallow and lightweight; but nicely done all the same.",7,0,1,21 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Rough Guide to Middle Earth
","Tolkein's epic fantasy novel had long been considered unfilmable, on account of the richness of the imaginative landscape described in his prose and occasional, vertiginous drawings.  So the first thing to say about Peter Jackson's film is that it looks (i) amazing and (ii) exactly as you expected it to look. New Zealand and computer graphics have combined to create a visual extravaganza wholly true to the original's aesthetic.  But the replacement of words by images in itself is merely a prerequisite for a successful film. And the words are largely, sadly, replaced: little of the text survives, and even in the beginning, when Galadriel gives us an introduction to then history of the ring, Tolkein's own various accounts have been discarded (arguably necessarily) in place of a softer, more matter-of-fact overview. None the less, the main details of the story survive. Scriptwriter Frances Walsh has simplified in places but has not shied away from the essential complexity and richness of the tale.  Of course one has quibbles: we lose the subtlety of Saruman (a shame, when Christopher Lee is the perfect casting); all the hobbits, Bilbo excepted, seem about half a generation too young; the re-invention of Arwen as a warrior princess is dull, obvious and anachronistic; Hugo Weaving's Elrond is slightly camp and his council lacks due solemnity; and however often Viggo Mortenson flashes his cheekbones, Aragorn was surely never such a pretty boy. But compared with what seems right, what seems wrong is surely trivial by contrast. And yet the film still fails to really capture the magic of the book.The problem is that a lot of the strength of the book is what happens when nothing is happening.  A few examples suffice to illustrate the point. Headed towards Weathertop, Aragorn tells the hobbits fragments of ancient legends; by the time the party arrives, their destination is established as a place of wonder and history.  But in the film, we leap there straight from Bree: Aragorn points out the ruined fortress as if he had never mentioned it previously, in the manner of a tour guide pointing out the sights.  The subsequent flight to the ford is notable in the book as a time when the heroes are waiting, day after day, for inevitable attack, which when at last it happens has a much more powerful impact than the simple chase scene rendered here; while the attempted passage of the mountains, grimly familiar in prose to anyone who has battled the elements at altitude, is reduced to a single dramatic scene, that makes the point (that the pass will not be crossed) but wholly fails to suggest that the characters might die here (and slowly), defeated by nothing more magical than weather and cold. In consequence the film becomes a mere sequence of dramatic challenges: fight the orcs, flee the balrog, meet Galadriel, etc., etc., etc.  The sense of time, and of the characters' changing perceptions of their mission as it passes, is lost.  Instead, the battle scenes, which in part one are merely skirmishes, are played up.  In spite of its great length, this film lacks patience. Everything is amazing; and so in a sense nothing is.  Each landmark, so hard-earned in the primary text, comes quickly after the one before, like a sequence of edited highlights.  Overall, the effect is that of a three hour trailer.For devotees of the book 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is fascinating but flawed. It's far from clear that it could have been better.  But maybe film is simply too literal a medium to capture a vision that as literature is always more than the sum of its parts.",6,1,2,23 April 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix Imploed
","'The Matrix' was a film that rehashed many of the corniest ideas, and re-used much of the most familiar aesthetics, of science fiction; but it stitched them together into a package so breathtakingly implemented that few people noticed, or if they did notice, cared. Then the sequel came out and the backlash begun. I actually thought that 'The Matrix Reloaded' was not too bad given the film it was trying to be: in other words, it's hard to imagine how such a sequel could have been much different (I also thought the original was good but not great). But among devotees of the first film, I think the real crime of the second film was to expose the emperor's clothes in the first movie: often fantasy stories hint at a complete world, glimpses of a wider mystery, and 'The Matrix' was no exception; but a second film spent reworking the same ground served only to expose how little was actually there in the first place. By the time of the third movie (made together with the second, and released soon after), expectations were lower and criticism was less; but in fact, the first half of 'The Matrix Revolutions' is undoubtedly the worst part of the trilogy, with its incomprehensible plot and misguided attempts to squeeze the wooden romance between Keanu Reeves' character Neo and Carrie-Ann Moss's Trinity for more than it is worth. Later on, things pick up a bit, and the special effects are spectacular as ever, but the Wachowski brothers clearly have no truck with the maxim that 'less is more, and by the time of the film's conclusion, the movie is completely unplugged from any sort of narrative sense. What was fresh and original when the first film came out is tired and bombastic by the end of part three. And that's a shame.",5,0,1,9 July 2006
The Color of Money," Shoot pool, Fast Eddie!
","Line up Martin Scorcese to direct a sequel to the classic film 'The Hustler' and you might assume you'd be onto a winner.  But although  entertaining, 'The Color of Money' is merely a good, not a great film.  The world of film-making has changed since 1961 and compared to the original the newer film is, as you would expect, a lot slicker (the pool-playing scenes in particular are technically superb) and away from the table, the general dialogue is vastly improved.  But the contemporary pop music that plays in the background throughout the first half is truly dreadful (though hardly Scorcese's fault), while no-one has one liners as good as 'The Hustler's Jackie Gleason had.  More surprisingly, there's less tension (and a whole lot less atmosphere) in the pool matches themselves: Scorcese clearly did not want to make a 'sports' movie, but in consequence, the footage of the actual games is entirely for show while the plot goes on elsewhere.The world outside Hollywood has changed as well, and to be fair, 'The Color of Money' addresses this as one of its themes.  But in some ways, the newer world is less interesting than the old one.  Fast Eddie, Paul Newman's character in both films, was, as a young man, desperate to win: victory offered his only chance to be someone, to prove his worth to himself in the face of severe self-doubt.  The alternative, given his innate character flaws, was literally destitution.  While his main opponent, Minnesota Fats (Gleason), did not just shoot pool, he was pool, defining and defined by the world in which he lived.  But in the sequel, pool, to Fast Eddie, has become just another way of making money, while his annoying protege Vincent (a very young, and surprisingly chubby-faced Tom Cruise) has no fear of life and complete self-belief. However well it's done, it's hard to care too much about either of them. It's no coincidence that film picks up when Fast Eddie re-finds his love for the game.  For the first time, there's something really at stake (though at the same time, there's a little self-indulgence in the later stages of the plot).'The Color of Money' is a fun movie to watch, especially if you've seen 'The Hustler' and are already on Fast Eddie's side.  But it's predecessor will be remembered when it has been forgotten.",8,1,2,5 June 2004
21," By the numbers thriller
","There have been many great movies about casinos, but '21' is sadly not one of them. Heavy handed, unsubtle and obvious, it's a film about a maths professor who gathers a team of elite students to pull of a gambling scam. But every point is clumsily made: the hero is a genius who just wants to pay his fees for Harvard Medical School; his friends are geeks but this fellow gamblers are all glamorous; the direction of the plot is highly signalled and even the twists are well-signposted; someone turns out to be utterly (and arguably incoherently) villainous, and so on. What makes this so bad is the fact that the film attempts to disguise its ordinariness behind a veneer of pseudo-cleverness: for example, the hero proves his brilliance to us (and his tutor) by solving a probability problem that is in fact well known outside mathematical circles and which he is posed in the middle of a lecture that is nothing to do with probability theory; while the basics of the scam are laid out on the table for the audience, but it's details remain obscure and unexplained. It's a shame, as if the film didn't labour its points so badly, it could still have been entertaining. As it is, it's by the numbers stuff which, in the words of a line uttered in it by Kevin Spacey's character, won't tell you anything you didn't already know.",4,0,1,23 July 2008
Pitch Black," Doesn't eclipse 'Alien'
","There have been few films as influential as 'Alien' and the first thing to say about 'Pitch Black' is how closely it follows the template laid down by that groundbreaking film. An ensemble cast of characters, landed in circumstances unknown by presumed hostile, try to keep their cool in the face of a growing but undefined sense of unease, but in the finale have to fight to the death with aliens (and traitors among themselves); not all will survive. Add to that a grungy, poorly lit aesthetic and you might consider the film almost a carbon copy. But if you're going to copy a film, then copying one known for it's atmosphere of claustrophobic tension is not such a bad idea, and there's a lot of original detail in 'Pitch Black' as well, some of it good, other bits less so. For example, the central idea is of a spaceship crashing on planet bathed in near-permanent light, thanks to three suns; but on which, like a desert in the rain, all sorts of things come alive when (every twenty years or so) there's a solar eclipse. The three suns also provide three alternative colours of light (before the darkness strikes, of course), which allows director David Twohy three visions for the price of one; but he doesn't seem quite to know what to do with this gift, and while the colour of the world changes from yellow to blue to red, it's unclear what this adds to the film except for a superficial jumpiness. As for the indoor scenes, shot unfailing in half-light only, the use of semi-darkness as a cheap way of creating an air of menace has surely not been this overdone since David Fincher's 'Se7en'. As for the characterisation, the dynamics of a group whose members have their own selfish agendas are well portrayed, but the film lets itself down by making clear its sympathies for two crew members over the others, especially as the two characters it favours are essentially the least believable: vin Diesel's super-criminal Riddick, and the unlikely babelicious ship's commander, played by Radha Mitchell. While the moral darkness of the plot's conclusion is offset by the willingness to grant vin Diesel corny, Schwarzenegger-style lines, usually involving at least one word starting with the letter 'f'. Another flaw is Twohy's exaggerated preference for constant cross-cutting between scenes, which sometimes increases the tension, but sometimes makes the film appear more like a pop video than a movie. He undoubtedly succeeds in capturing an interesting look, but only at the price of also acquiring a certain corollary shallowness.In conclusion, this certainly is not a wholly original film. But it looks good, and is plenty scary. Moreover, the whole somehow feels a little more distinctive than the individual parts. Still, one can't help but feel, this movie is just 'Alien' with better special effects, less judiciously used.",7,2,2,2 October 2005
Cold Mountain," A film without insight into good and evil
","Loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey', 'Cold Mountain' tells the story of the final days of the American Civil War, and one man's struggle to get home. Unfortunately, it's also a world where the heroes, even when supposedly starving, have 21st century muscles, and the heroines all have 21st century teeth. More than that, they have 21st century values as well: I'm not saying that all southerners were slave-owning bigots, but the film establishes very early on where it's coming from, where the hero shows, in the very first scene, what was surely very unusual courtesy from a southerner to a black man, while shortly afterwards the heroine declares her happiness to be away from slaves, though without specifying the nature of her objection. Which means, of course, that the film offers no insights into how white people, viewed as having the highest moral character in their own community, could have fought a war ultimately for the purpose of the right to enslave others. Meanwhile, the various foes who stand in the path of a happy ending are all depicted as evil and venal, in contrast to the nobility and modernity of the sympathetic characters. This is less history than 'The Lord of the Rings'; where moral merit is not a judgement passed on a set of behaviours in a particular environment, but rather an innate property of the good and the beautiful.",5,6,9,1 October 2014
American Psycho," American Why-co?
","What keeps us from doing evil?  A capacity for empathy, hopefully, plus our subconscious belief (ingrained by, among other things, our habitual shortage of money) that you simply can't do anything you want.  As neither of these attitudes characterise the yuppie, the idea that such a person could become a psychopathic killer is quite a good one.  Nonetheless, 'American Psycho', based on exactly this premise, is not really a successful film. 
There are two linked reasons for this.  Firstly, the idea that the yuppie is as inhuman as the murderer is introduced at the outset, a position so extreme there is no onward journey that can be made.  Secondly, the killer's actions are a response to his life in general, rather than to particular stimuli, hence there's no plot in the conventional sense.  Christian Bale does a good job playing a man with no soul, but there's nothing new to learn once the concept is grasped.  The emphasis on the 1980s settings also serves to dull the film's satirical intent, de-stressing its own relevance to us, today.Brett Easton Ellis can certainly write, but this is not a great adaptation of his famous book.  For a really disturbing and suspenseful look at the world of American business, try Neil La Bute's 'In the company of men'.",5,0,3,8 June 2003
The Shining," Shining but not luminous
","Supernatural mysteries take many forms.  Some are purely about the psychology of belief (for example, 'The Blair Witch Project'); some present ghosts as banal facts of everyday life ('Truly, Madly, Deeply', and my own favourite, Kieslowski's 'No End'); some depict literal terror ('The Exorcist') and some are just downright bizarre ('Twin Peaks').  The Shining is a highly peculiar but nonetheless effective amalgam of all these genres. Even at the end, the viewer has little more idea what is going on than the characters.  I guess that's what makes its a mystery.The film is chiefly remembered for the collaboration of its legendary director and its equally legendary star.  Stanley Kubrick's mark is certainly clear, especially in the beginning: he shoots every scene as if something terrible is going to happen; then cuts away abruptly, the threat unresolved.  The scenes with the ghosts are shot so as to appear like bad cases of superimposition: the spirits are somehow in the same rooms at the living, and not, at the same time.  The tense score is intrusive but successful.Jack Nicolson gives a good performance in the central role, but without the subtlety seen in his greatest films (see him in Five Easy Pieces for a truly great portrayal of a misanthropist).  The other actors' performances are universally downright bad, in a possibly intentional parody of cheap horror films. The plot is likewise an assembly of corny, but beautifully executed, tricks.This is a seriously weird film, more imaginative than most in its genre but ultimately no less silly.  Make of it what you will.",6,0,3,24 January 2003
American Beauty," Sub-Lynchian
","Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty' is a fun satire on American suburban culture, but in my opinion it hardly deserved it's Oscars.  Potato-jowelled Kevin Spacey, in the lead role as a middle aged man undergoing a mid-life crisis, is very funny, his behaviour unreasonable yet appealing at the same time. But the symptoms of his crisis (lusting after his daughter's best friend, buying a fast car, etc.) are all quite unoriginal.  Annette Bening plays his ambitious, shallow wife (and there's a degree of misogyny in the way the film takes Spacey's side over hers, when coupled with its portrayal of Mena Suvari's teenage bitch): the other adult characters (the repressed bigot, the cheesy salesman) are similarly cliched. Fundamentally, this is quite a shallow film, albeit one that makes you laugh.The younger characters are, if anything, even more problematic.  Mena Suvari plays Angela, the young sexpot for whom Spacey falls: her performance is poor, fluctuating wildly between tough girl front and inner vulnerability. What's interesting about real people is that we can be two things at the same time: but Angela goes from bad girl to good, and is never in between. The screenwriter also makes a common error in believing you make a character seem sexy by getting her to swear a lot; but Angela always seems forced and knowing, ironically (from the viewer's perspective) utterly failing to represent the combination of playfulness and naturalness in real teenagers which would offer an explanation for Spacey's lust.  Maybe this is even intentional cowardice on the part of the film-makers - it's safer by far to make a film about a middle aged man in love with a dream, than by one really attracted to an actual (younger) girl. By making Angela so clearly symbolic, they escape the risk of getting attacked by those hyper-sensitive to portrayals of paedophilia.Thora Birch's character, Jane, is Spacey's daughter.  The film decides to largely exonerate her of responsibility in its wider farce: it mocks her mode of, like, speaking, but it caresses her more than it puts in the boot: her ludicrous desire for plastic surgery is, for example, hardly touched. Plus, as in all Hollywood movies, even the 'plain' girl in the plot is necessarily played by a beautiful actress.Meanwhile, Wes Bentley's character is another stock part: the weird kid who turns out to be all right; but not because weirdness is OK, but rather because he's not really weird after all. He may not be weird but he is a drug dealer, though presented in a wholly positive light as if morally uncorrupted by his criminal trade.  Even if one has no problems with cannabis use, it's strange that he is presented as a role model (in contrast to the suburban hypocrites) when his ability to make a fortune out of his work is obviously derived from that very hypocrisy (if drugs were legal, no-one would get rich selling them): but this film lacks the intelligence to see that he is a part of the picture (and not apart from it).  Also, his interest in filming things, reminding one of numerous other movies including 'Peeping Tom' and 'Sex, Lies and Videotape', helps the plot along but is one of those devices one suspects are of more interest to film-makers than to the general public.The film ends by giving Spacey a moment of epiphany he has done nothing to earn (if he really had found meaning in his life through quitting the rat race, that would be different but all he has actually done is played out his fantasies without yet counting the consequences).  Indeed, it gets all solemn and meaningful in a long drawn out conclusion. Overall I have been very hard on this film, which I actually enjoyed.  But fundamentally it is a very compromised satire, one that mocks its characters but forgives its audience, even though the two are really the same (and when a braver film would dare to do things the other way around). Anyone can laugh at unhappy families.  A real revolutionary would aim at the happy ones.",7,1,3,4 April 2004
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse then
","Francis Ford Coppola was at the height of his powers when he decided to make his gramatically-challenged film 'Apocalypse Now', which pivots around the brilliant idea of using Joseph Conrad's novel 'Heart of Darkness', about Kurtz, a capable and idealistic colonialist gone mad in deepest Africa, as a metaphor for the Vietnam war.  It should also have been the first major American film to address that difficult subject, but it was subject to numerous, infamous delays in production and was not finished until 1979, by which time other films (like 'The Deer Hunter' or, indirectly, 'Taxi Driver') had already addressed the same subject.  What remains is a wildly ambitious film of vast scope, full of astonishing images but possessed of a certain fundamental silliness in a way that 'The Deer Hunter', for example, completely avoids.  Having read the book since I first saw the film, however, one surprising discovery is that the incoherence and relative absence of closure, which some may consider faults, actually derive from the source material.Viewed solely as cinema, 'Apocalypse Now' is a flawed but original, thought-provoking and and highly distinctive piece of film.  But it's also interesting in terms of where it fits into the (by now, very well defined) genre of Vietnam movies.  The classic narrative now avoids the political question (should the war have been fought?) to concentrate on the hardships of the (mainly working class) young soldiers whose misfortune was to have to fight it.  'Apocalypse Now', although not overtly political itself, is arguably a stronger film than most, because it does not allow its protagonists to escape personal responsibility for their actions: the draftees may have been victims, but they were perpetrators too, and the film recognises the duality.  However, this does not make it a peacenik anti-war flick.  Coppola cleverly borrows the ambivalence that Marlowe, Conrad's narrator, has towards Kurtz, for his own narrator Willard.  Willard's (and Kurtz's) hatred of the war as is manifests itself in split emotions, one peaceable and the other hostile, the urge to destroy, to kill, to fight hard and with 'clarity' of purpose - rather like the Viet Kong - with the implication that this way the war could have been won.  This double psychology is central to the mood of the whole story, and is a convincing mindset for these two professional soldiers.  But perhaps also serves to make the film slightly more palatable to its domestic audience, allowing the viewer to take away the message of their choice.  Another observation is that the portrayal of the 'natives' is scarcely more advanced than it was in Conrad's book - the Vietnamese appear as little more than romantic savages, and others have commented how the largely uninhabited jungles through which Willard travels ignore the reality of densely populated Vietnam.  As with 'Heart of Darkness', 'Apocalypse Now' is best seen as a fable, that asks questions about the behaviour of supposedly civilised men, but which operates within terms of reference that the same men would recognise.The final word must be on Marlon Brando, who is surely the perfect embodiment of the enigmatic Kurtz.  His is a great performance, though it doesn't last long - a shame, for he holds the screen with a quiet brilliance.",8,1,2,2 March 2004
Edward Scissorhands," The director's cut
","Tim Burton's whimsical fable is a visually exotic parody of small town values, exploring themes such as loneliness and conformity; a very unusual horror film; and a simple tragedy to boot.  With minimal plot but coherent vision and child-like wonder, Burton has made a film whose view of the world resembles few others.  What he has not done is made a masterpiece.Some films build fantasy elements into the real world, and explore what might happen if such a thing came true: 'The Truman Show', and 'Being John Malkovich', are two obvious examples of this genre.  But Tim Burton does not make films like that.  Even his most realistic work (e.g. Ed Wood) takes place in a world that at times appears to be wholly imaginative. This is not necessarily good.  It means that one cannot look for ordinary human motivations and actions in his stories: in this film, for example, a small American town lies in the shadow of a Gothic castle which not one of its inhabitants has ever visited until a cosmetics saleswoman dares to make a call; and at many subsequent turns, the actions of the characters just don't square with what anyone real would actually do if confronted with a boy with scissors for hands.  At one level, this complaint is petty: the story is, after all, a mere fairy tale.  But this is precisely the point.  Though visually highly original, the film's comments about modern society can only be in a morally obvious fashion: the behaviour of the protagonists too stylised and contrived to allow for anything more subtle.  Which leaves you at moments the feeling you are watching little more than a live action version of Wallace and Grommit (with fewer jokes to boot; though the film is quite effective in spinning out its only real gag).All Burton's films place style (albeit in quite a deep sense) over substance; the creation of a form over what goes on inside.  The strength of Edward Scissorhands lies in its simplicity; and in the bewilderment in Johnny Depp's eyes (even if he does resemble Malcolm McLaren!). Without pretence, it eventually draws you into its beautiful, but two-dimensional, world.",7,6,9,14 March 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," Insincere
","David O. Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' is ultimately a disappointing film: an unconvincing portrayal of mental illness and family dysfunction, with a weak romantic comedy subplot and an utterly meaningless second subplot featuring a dance competition. The central characters are not particularly sympathetic either: if they don't convince as mentally ill, they do convince as utterly self-obsessed - the attraction that the two leads supposedly feel for each other is asserted but in no way demonstrated. It's unclear what Russell was trying to do in this movie; but it's not funny, and nothing in it feels like it comes from the heart.",5,3,5,25 February 2015
The White Ribbon," Out of time
","In Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon', a serious of dark, mysterious events overtake a German village in the year immediately before world war one. Haneke's portrait of life in this era is mesmerising but more poetic than realistic: the tyranny of aristocracy, the climate of sexual repression and the mask of everyday quietness and civility seem deliberately overdone, albeit in an understated way; the film's schoolteacher hero seems almost absurdly unauthoratitive, and it's hard to imagine such a person surviving in a real school in any age. Yet the film, shot in black and white, has a certain power, and remains watchable in spite of its length. The odd thing is that I'm still not at all certain what Haneke's purpose was in making it.",7,1,3,24 February 2013
Being John Malkovich," Delicatessan meets Monty Python
","Being John Malkovich is one of the oddest, and most brilliantly original, comedies ever made.  John Cusack, brilliant as the anti-hero, is a depressed puppeteer who takes a job as a filing clerk in a very strange office.  The surreal detail, yet consistent atmospherics, of Cusack's life, are bleakly rendered in a sublimely low-key fashion. Then he discovers the strangest thing of all, a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich.  The rest of the film is more silly than truly surreal, and the tone more farcical, but it never rests on its premise, instead developing ever more layers, and finally delivers an appropriately nightmarish finale.In the vividness of its portrait of a grotesque world, the film resembles Delicatessan (and not just because of the monkey!).  For sheer insane originality, it brings to mind Monty Python (the original sketch shows, not the over-rated movies which lack the coherence and depth of Jonze's effort). In terms of plot, it resembles nothing.  Full marks to Malkovich for staring in the film for which he surely now will ever after be known by.",9,1,2,13 March 2003
Spider-Man," Just another superhero movie
","Comic book adaptations are ten-a-penny these days; and while Tobey Maguire, so often annoyingly dopey, is a natural to play Peter Parker, the amazing Spider-Man's alter ego, overall, I found this film ordinary. There's some good stuff: I liked the idea of Parker trying out his super-powers in a wrestling competition, but his subsequent development into a full-blown superhero seemed accelerated, and a wasted opportunity. I also found the Green Goblin, with his static mask, a frustrating enemy - his failure to move his jaw when speaking makes one feel like one is reading a static strip, not watching a moving picture. The film gains some tension towards the end, but whereas 'Batman Begins' grew on me in spite of myself, 'Spider-Man' didn't; and there's some overplayed moralising in the mix as well. In some ways, comic books boil down a story to its essence, and the rest is all in the visuals; the same is true for this film, and for me, there's not enough complexity to make it truly interesting.",5,0,2,20 April 2011
Ratatouille," Surprisingly conventional
","Modern animated features have often been marked by profound ruminations of life and death 'Toy Story', 'Madagascar') or by hip references to popular culture (the 'Shrek' movies). But 'Ratatouille', this year's smash hit, it by contrast a very conventional animation, a straightforward cartoon story inspired by the simple pun that gives the film its name; indeed, it reminded me in some ways of 'Wallace and Grommit', although (obviously) without the northern English flavour. I liked the animation of France (Citroen D-Seies included) and Peter O' Toole is very funny, voicing a snooty restaurant critic, but I think a chance was missed to make the rats as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life; a cuddly rat is sort of missing the point. And overall, I found (as an adult viewer), the same joke stretched a little thin by the end of the film; a film where a woman shoots up her own house to kill a rat (as happens early in this movie) is not one to encourage dark thoughts about the nature of life.",5,8,15,12 December 2007
Bad Teacher," Bad teacher, indifferent movie
","'Bad Teacher' is a film that sounds as if it should be fun: Cameron Diaz plays someone meeting this description, a young woman with no real desire to teach. But the result is very disappointing. Firstly, with typical Hollywood sexism, her professional indifference comes from an expectation of securing a rich man to look after her. But more importantly, not a lot happens in the film. We don't see extraordinary displays of bad teaching or bad behaviour; there isn't even that hoary old chestnut, the redemption story. Instead, another (not particularly sympathetic) teacher tries to expose Diaz, and fails, and that's about it. It's neither realistic nor entertaining, while Diaz, to be frank, looks a little odd, her approaching middle age hidden behind a peculiar face-mask - she neither seems young or old, but a rather curious twenty-going on-forty. There's surely the potential for a rich black comedy in the basic idea; but sadly, this isn't it.",Null,5,13,4 November 2011
54," Not freedom
","Elite nightclubs are all about hedonism and the power of the young, rich, and beautiful; places where a rigid hierarchy holds sway, albeit an alternative one. One may understand why those in the in-crowd may enjoy such places; but to suggest that they symbolise 'freedom' is a rather strange interpretation. But every Hollywood film has to pay homage to this virtue, however still defined, and so '54', Mark Christopher's film about a once-fashionable New York venue, tries to suggest there was something idealistic about the place, in spite of the fact there seem few ideals on view. To strengthen this rather weak idea, his script casts lead actor Ryan Phillipe as a young Adonis, who is far too sweet to serve as a useful vehicle into the dark side of this underworld; but he tells us there was something mystical about the place, and as the audience, we're expected to believe him, although all we see are a lot of dancing, drug-taking, and sex. Which might not be unbelievable, but is hardly unique. Meanwhile, the film's plot goes nowhere and even seems to bottle out of it's own natural climax. The real Studio 54 might indeed have been where it was all happening; but this gentle homage is really very bland.",3,6,9,5 February 2005
The Lego Movie," Not quite awesome, but fun nonetheless
","Who could imagine you could make a film about Lego? 'The Lego Movie' actually manages this, with a plot that is an inverse of that of 'Toy Story', and a rich host of jokes, some very funny, fired at a furious pace. The start of the movie could almost be seen as a satire of life in modern China; the romantic subplot (the figurine fancied by the hero turns out to already have a boyfriend - Bat-man - who takes some beating) seems truer to life than most romantic comedies. The presence of Bat-man is just one of many ways the film exploits the vast range of Lego figurines now available, from the ordinary to the iconic - and the film's ultimate message, that ordinary should not mean anonymous, is also a softened version of the naked positivity usually found in American kids' films. What the film lacks is the wonderful reflective pace of 'WALL-E'; it's perpetually noisy and busy, holding the attention of the younger half of its intended audience with a whirligig of flying bricks. For me, it was a little too frenetic to be truly awesome, and of course it's all advertising for the product, but it transcends its modest premise by some margin.",7,0,2,26 January 2015
Control," Portrait of the artist as a confused boy
","Anton Corbijn's film 'Control', about the death of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, challenges some of rock and roll's most enduring myths. Before Curtis was famous, he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work; he got married as a boy and when he subsequently took advantage of his growing fame to attract an additional admirer, the consequent moral strain drove him to despair; and the drugs associated with his suicide were anti-epileptics. After his death, Joy Division became New Order, and famously owned a nightclub; but according to Corbijn, Curtis' life was resolutely homespun. As a tender portrait of what it's really like for a young band starting out, the film works well, and Sam Riley is great as Curtis. But some of the film's choices are less clearly correct, such as the portrayal of Curtis' birthplace of Macclesfield as the archetypal grim north, or the casting Samantha Morton as his wife; whatever her skills as an actress, she's too old for the part, and she strains too hard to convey girlishness in an apparent attempt to compensate. I'm also not sure why the film is shot in black and white. But it's certainly much more real than '24 Hour Party People', another movie about the same time and place.",8,1,1,10 April 2010
Now You See Me," Too much
","In theory, a thriller about magic should be a winner. The illusion of magic is achieved through confidence and misdirection, perfect ingredients for a tricksy plot. Yet many of the best thrillers are also already confidence and misdirection without the aid of magic; confidence tricks within plots, but also, the guile of the film-maker in misleading his audience. And there's even a further layer – one watches a fictional story on an implicit assumption that it obeys a set of rules implied by the way that the story is told – but the film-maker can break this compact. In extremis, magic in movie can actually be real.Which means that the film-maker has many layers of illusion at his disposal; but also the temptation to over-egg the pudding. The set-up for 'Now You See Me' is corny but brilliant – four cocksure, mainstream, Las Vegas magicians may (or may not) have engineered a real crime under the cloak of their magic. To work, such a film needs to have a theory of how this could be done that is both cunning and plausible, one that can trick both the victims within the story, but also the real world audience. And if the film seems to hint that there's real magic behind the trickery well, that only adds to the atmosphere. But the power available to the film-maker can also be abused. In this film, as in Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', a character 'disappears' by falling through a trapdoor. I have no idea whether real world magicians are sufficiently skilled to distract their audiences from noticing. But I'm sure that in neither film was an actor filmed falling through the door, but rather that the disappearance was conjured only in the editing room. The director could defend himself by claiming to be showing what the in-story audience believe they are seeing (as opposed to what they really saw), but this means that the film's real audience have no independent appeal to their senses, have to take it on trust even as they're being deceived. Although it's not a magic film, the plot of 'Now You See Me' has elements that resemble 'The Usual Suspects',- a film whose final plot trick was both breathtaking and inane (with the appearance of a character the film had just explained to us did not actually exist in a layer outside the story in which he had been created).'The Usual Suspects' was, nonetheless, well done in a way that 'Now You See Me' is not. The tricks in this film might be technically explicable, but they're so over the top, so sophisticated, so contrived, they're not remotely plausible – indeed, they seem to have been conceived by the scriptwriters mainly because they make for good cinematography. And the plot's final bait and switch, and revealed revenge motive, are tired devices. One thing I did like, though, was the swaggering stage personas of the magician-criminals – you could certainly believe that such a crew could pull something off, though sadly not this – a more modest affair might actually have been good.",5,2,3,13 October 2013
American History X," Watchable, but heavy-handed
","There's a strong performance from Edward Norton in 'American History X', a film about racial tensions; but also some heavy-handedness. The personal development of the characters is depicted in a rather deterministic fashion; Norton's Nazi is far more eloquent than any real-life fascist, while Avery Brooks' teacher is blessed (in a clichéd and patronising gift so often granted to black characters) with unsurmountable gravitas. The direction is also rather obvious, with solemn voice-overs, an over-the-top score, and the needless use of black-and-white photography to differentiate the recent past from the present. While the underlying squalor, and drug abuse, that promotes gang violence, is hardly shown at all. Norton makes it watchable; but it's all rather obvious.",7,0,1,12 June 2007
Spirited Away," No face, but lots of character
","Hayao Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' was an unexpected international hit, but not an undeserved one. A charming Japanese fantasy story, the film is beautifully animated, full of delightful, original details and mercifully free of the universal Disney narrative of self-improvement and consequent reward, it deserves the praise lavished upon it. And I loved the doleful no-face, a most unlikely monster. At first, you do notice the static backgrounds of a traditional animation (compared with what computer animation can produce), but soon one is lost inside the magical world. One thing surprised me, though: how un-Japanese it felt, except for the tendency of the characters to bow, there was very little explicitly eastern about the story.",Null,0,1,3 April 2009
The Usual Suspects," Unusually good
","Brian Singer's thriller tells a slick, ridiculous but hugely entertaining yarn, with a postmodern twist: much of its shock value deriving from confounding the expectations of the audience rather than from the innate properties of the story.  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal Kint, the man with a tale to tell the police; and the film as a whole is sharp and concise, leaving the viewer with an appetite for more.But in spite of this, the film is good, rather than great.  There are holes in the plot, and the essential device is actually a breach of the universal contract between the movie-goer and the the film-maker: the only way to avoid being suckered would be to adopt a scepticism so thorough-going that it would be impossible to enjoy this (or indeed any other) fictional tale. Neither of these things really matter, but what is more of a problem is the nugatory quality of what results: instead of delighting us with alternative realities, the film destroys its own premise without putting anything concrete in its place, as if it has no purpose beyond teasing.  Teasing, however, is something it does extraordinarily well.  In conclusion, 'The Usual Suspects' is a superior work of contemporary entertainment; but too empty to be rated a masterpiece.",8,1,2,7 October 2003
No Country for Old Men," A better than average psychopathic killer movie
","In 'No Country for Old Men', the much feted Coen brothers attempt to do for taciturn Texans what they did for folksy Minnesotans in 'Fargo'. Cue deadpan farce, with a sense of humour as dry as the hot desert climate. The film has a certain style, charm and menace, and the Coen's certainly deserve credit for sticking with a story that emphatically rejects any sort of populist ending. But at the end of the day, it's a film about a psychopathic killer; and for all its undoubted class, I've seen enough of those before. While it's true that this particular killer is not so much human as a form of devil come to pass judgement on who should live and who should die, this idea is also less original that it sounds (most films about psychopaths attempt to play this idea, albeit few as successfully as this one). I have to confess that I've never quite understood why most of the Coen's films are so well regarded; they're certainly clever, and refreshingly non-mainstream; but I don't find them that hilarious and they're shallower than they affect. I liked watching this movie; but I didn't see greatness.",7,1,5,26 October 2010
District 9," Being Human
","Many of the ideas of the celebrated film 'Alien' are reinterpreted in Neill Blomkamp's movie 'District 9' in the context of a parable about Apartheid South Africa; and rather more surprisingly, there are also shades of 'The Office', as an un-self aware bureaucrat becomes an unlikely hero. It's nicely done, and the political parallels don't seem wholly limited to the past either, but the film's weakness, rather like that of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', is that the parable is perhaps just a little too obvious: it's hard to care too much about the plot when it's so obviously constructed to make a point. But there's skill in the telling: we're encouraged to see the aliens in progressively more humanised form (although the film perhaps also suggested that being human is nothing particularly to be proud of). 'District 9' may not be a masterpiece, but it's certainly more interesting than the average piece of celluloid sci-fi.",7,1,1,14 October 2012
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Strong characterisation and acting, weak plot
","There's much to like in Andrew Dominik's film, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford': most of all, it truly is a psychological western. Brad Pitt is excellent as Jesse, a murderous but charismatic bully, fully aware of his own magnetism and ability to inspire terror; while a group of misfits gather around him, bound to him through fear, envy, idolisation and daydreams. But somehow the plot doesn't quite work: Jesse seems to rightly distrust his acolytes, yet nonetheless, leaves his fate in their hands. The movie's solemn narration (not to mention its title) gives away the plot; while the broader context (the aftermath of the American civil war, which goes a long way to explaining James' status as a folk hero) is passed over. Ultimately, it's a lengthy movie, in which not enough happens that is not foreseeable from the earliest scenes.",6,0,2,5 July 2015
Tigerland," Best in class
","The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.",9,1,1,21 October 2005
Batman Begins," Surprisingly watchable
","On hearing that Christopher Nolan was to reboot the 'Batman' franchise with a new seriousness, it was tempting to roll one's eyes. This is a story about a man who fights crime dressed as a giant bat; how much inner depth is there to discover in this concept? Added to the innate absurdity of the idea, there is also a fair share of standard Hollywood nonsense in 'Batman Begins': a pair of near-teenage, drop-dead gorgeous attorneys; Liam Neeseon virtually reprising his role in 'Star Wars'; and a Batmobile that, in spite of being the most amazing vehicle ever designed, can barely outrun a police car (although I did like the idea of it coming with sat-nav). In reality, the success of a comic book adaptation doesn't really depend on true seriousness, rather on it's ability to combine superficially interesting ideas (which rarely hold up on closer inspection) with arresting images, and it has to be said that in this respect, 'Batman Begins' actually works: there's always something going on, something to look at, some cause of tension, even if the underlying story is innately preposterous. And the climax is really quite a thrilling spectacle. It's certainly a much better beast than Nolan's later, overpraised 'Inception', with better pacing, a more internally consistent fictional world, and less portentous philosophising and intrusive exposition. I'm still not a huge fan of comic-book adaptations in general; but this one is done well.",8,0,0,23 January 2011
Man on the Moon," Carrey's best performance
","All 'serious' comics tend to turn away from pure humour towards an investigation of what it means to be funny: perhaps, that's why they're considered serious comics, because they're just not funny themselves any more. But Andy Kaufman, throughout his career, pushed the definition of comedy to its limit. But we he any good, and does the fact of his early death justify a biopic? Or, to put it another way, can someone who did not grow up with, or does not appreciate, Kaufman's own peculiar form of humour, enjoy Milos Forman's film, 'Man in the Moon'? Fortunately, the answer is yes, because of Kaufman's own bizarre character, brought brilliantly to life by Jim Carrey (not an actor I usually particularly enjoy). It is said that Kaufman never came out of character, but in the film's most telling line, a girlfriend comments 'there is no real you', and the film certainly does not subscribe to the view that there was a normal human being behind the masks. Kaufman, as portrayed in this film, remains an enigma, maybe he even was an enigma to himself, but this adds a quality to the story of his journey through life that sets it apart from ordinary tales. When you finish watching this film, you don't necessarily like the act (if 'act' is the right word); but in spite of yourself, you do like the man.",8,1,2,20 January 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Competent but conventional
","There's a fairly standard narrative in war films today: that wars are hell, but that the men who fight them deserve our respect, and it's perhaps unsurprising that Stephen Spielberg's film about the Normandy landings essentially repeats the message. The movie's structure: an initial battle, an interlude, and then a concluding fight, is also typical; and background music, slow motion scenes and a present day top-and-tail to the story are added in to make sure that the audience knows what to think. In spite of this, it's not a bad film, fully depicting the chaotic horror of war and resisting the temptation to easily close at least some of its subplots; although on other occasions, it's too clear how a given tale is going to end. A bigger problem for me, however, was the absence of a character I could really care about: Tom Hanks's hero is just too heroic for me to care about, not in a silly way but a character for us to admire rather than for us to feel empathy for. Although a lengthy movie, it didn't feel like one; but in the end, I didn't feel moved by its respectful conclusion.",7,2,6,27 March 2010
The Pianist," Horrific, brilliant, almost uplifting
","It's widely believed that Roman Polanski has been in decline as a film-maker for a long time; but in 'The Pianist', he has produced a movie both brilliant and important, and fully deserving of its Oscars. He takes on a big subject - the holocaust - and brings to it a mastery of cinematic procedure and a surprisingly sure touch to a subject highly sensitive and also, through its terrible enormity, innately prone to melodrama if represented on screen. Like most films of its type, it tries to avoid this danger by steering clear of Auschwitz, which is probably incapable of inclusion in any sort of story without completely overbalancing it and isolating it from any point of connection with normal, human themes. But the horrors of what happened are in no sense hidden in the story of a survivor of the Polish ghetto who witnessed the most dreadful events, depicted here in a straightforward chronology encompassing the entire war. What happened first was that a community was forced to co-operate in its own extermination, induced to do so by the basic human need for hope; the eventual uprising was heroic but as doomed as non-resistance. By the time this happens, the hero has already escaped, but Polanski focuses on the desperate reality of his 'fortunate' situation: the lack of heating, food, water, and also intellectual nourishment; and the near-unbearable psychology of living when any moment might be your last. And in this remarkable film, everything seems both appalling and yet natural; the movie is littered with arresting images that in no way seem forced upon the viewer; and every performance is spot on, with Aiden Brody superb in the lead (Frank Findlay in particular is also excellent, but there are no weak points at all). While very detail that is needed to make the story convincing is covered - Brody's body double (who actually plays the piano for him) has long, pianist's fingers, we know this man to be a pianist as surely as the German officer who eventually pities him.And such is the skill with which the film is made that in the end, it leaves one not only reminded of the dreadful depths to which humanity can sink, but also of what is wonderful in our dubious species; and, after frequently implying the question, 'what is it that separates us from the animals?', provides part of the answer in the redeeming power of music. This is simply the best movie on its subject I have seen; and the also best movie Polanski has ever made.",10,0,2,8 February 2006
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Absence of substance
","I have to admit I don't understand the appeal of Wes Anderson's films. It's not just that I don't like them very much - I'm not a great fan of superhero movies either, but I can comprehend the sensibility that they appeal to. But Anderson's movies, so widely feted, leave be not only cold, but mystified. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', for example, conjures up beautifully a comically rendered vision of Mitteleuropean splendour fading into Nazism and communism in a way that should appeal to me. But in that world, Anderson tells a one-note story devoid of any human depth. To contrast, consider a movie like 'Delicatessan', for example, which is also set in a tragi-comic alternative world; but which tells a story full of very real emotion. To me, the richness of that movie's reality is light years away from the complete shallowness of Anderson's work. As I said, it's as if there's something that's sailing completely over my head; either that, or there's an audience completely unconcerned by the absence of substance. But I'm not part of it.",5,3,5,24 September 2017
Revolutionary Road," What is the point of Leonardo di Caprio?
","Sam Mendes 'American Beauty' was in my opinion overpraised: the script, a satire on suburban life, had its share of funny and perceptive moments, but ultimately pulled its punches. The director is back on the same territory with 'Revolutionary Road', only this time, his story is set in the 1950s. The look and feel of that decade is immaculately reconstructed (though were American kitchens really this modern?), but the tale is sadly simpler than his previous film, and amounts to little more than the assertion that suburban life is rubbish, even for the prosperous. There are few unexpected twists to the script, a ponderous and over-present background score, and to make it worse, Leonardo di Caprio plays the male lead. I can understand that when he was younger, women found him cute; but as an adult actor, he never fails to disappoint, decorating every role he with the same self-important whining. To me, he's an unappealing protagonist and fails to command my sympathy. The truth is, not everyone can direct films for a living, and if you can't, a life in the suburbs is probably as good as any. Of course, that's not to say that everyone is happy there; but the darkness in human hearts does not come from real estate and a garden, and I didn't see much insight into the deeper causes here.",6,1,2,21 January 2012
City of God," Behind the doors of hell
","Fernando Meirelles portrait of gang life, 'City of God', has been likened to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', but it's far more visceral, and less stylised, than that film, and underpinned by a portrait of the appalling poverty of the Brazillian slums. Fast-paced, superbly acted, uncompromising and without a whiff of glamour, it's a movie that re-invents the tired old gangster genre by actually telling it as it is, and not as the clichés tell us to expect, and a serious piece of social and political history on the side. This is a very fine film, one in which shreds of tattered humanity gleam through the cracks of the doors of hell.",9,1,3,3 January 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Final fantasy
","First of all, I have to say I was disappointed by the start of this film. The story, about a magical sword and a coterie of fighting monks, is pure 'Star Wars', and the fight scenes (viewed purely as such) are spectacular, and sometimes funny, but never convincing (and notice almost no-one dies: in one scene, Zhang Zhiyi's character, who continually fights with mighty swords, nonetheless expresses horror that someone actually got hurt in a fight).  We now live in the age of second generation special effects, which exist not to feign reality but to outdo it, which is in a way quite pointless - the most gripping scene in 'The Matrix' for me was the one where Keanu Reeves nearly fell off the skyscraper; once he got his magic powers, all my interest waned.But 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' grew on me as it went on.  For a start, it's one of the most beautiful films I have seen, with stunning images and music.  And once you start to see the outrageous movement of the characters as a kind of music too, rather than as plot, the film gains charm.  Though there is variation in tone, skilfully handled by director Ang Lee, everything in this fantastical world is logically and aesthetically consistent, and gradually it envelopes you.  And in spite of all the fighting, the film does not fetishise weaponry, in sharp contrast to the trigger-happy 'Matrix'.Plus there are three strong, individual, female characters, all-well acted, and a great performance from Chun Yow Fat in the leading role. And a subtle tale of unexpressed love that surprises one with the force that it carries at the denouement.So enjoy the trickery with wires, and then ignore it.  This is an old fashioned film in modern clothes:  an epic, beautiful tearjerker, and none the worse for that.",9,0,0,5 April 2004
Behind The Candelabra," Hiding in plain sight
","The persecution of gay people in the 20th century had some strange side-effects. Take the career of Liberace, the celebrity pianist, who styled himself according to the most outre social conventions of the gay community, but sued anyone who mentioned his sexuality. Liberace also had a series of semi-contractual relationships with much younger men, which one can see as the sort of thing a certain type of rich person might chose to do, but which surely seemed more natural in a world where a more orthodox relationship was socially prohibited. Steven Sodebergh's film shows us scenes from Liberace's life, but also portrays a very odd person and it doesn't really manage to make us feel sympathetic at a personal level, however much one acknowleges the potentially hostile world he had to navigate. Perhaps a full biopic, showing how he became the man we see in this movie, would have been more revealing.",6,0,0,31 July 2018
The Theory of Everything," An ordinary biopic of an extraordinary life
","The story of Stephen Hawking, a man who overcome extraordinary physical disadvantages to become both a preeminent scientist and a best-selling author of popular science books is remarkable; but it's a difficult one to capture in a dramatic film. In that sense, 'The Theory of Everything' merely recounts what you might already have known about Hawking and has the same inherent weaknesses as most biopics. A strength is the very convincing portrait of Hawking's deteriorating physical condition; I wouldn't exactly call it a tour-de-force of acting per se (given Hawking's decreasing ability to directly convey his own emotional state), but the overall depiction is very good. Perhaps because his professional work was so complex, the film concentrates mostly on his emotional life, and that of his wife, Jane. Her story is told as one of quietly plucky Englishness; in places, one feels the film might have shied away from truly telling things how they were. Overall, it's nicely done, but unlikely to be revelatory for anyone already familiar with the material.",7,0,0,23 April 2020
Velvet Goldmine," Velvet leadmine
","'Velvet Goldmine' sets out to tell the story of glam rock through a  biopic of Brain Slade, a fictional amalgam of many of the real stars of the era. The music and the image are highly convincing (though surely pop videos were not this advanced in the early 1970s), but this is a film unsure of it's purpose: it bears witness in the style of a documentary, but a real documentary about real people would have been more interesting, while we never learn enough about the characters' depths for it to work as pure fiction. Odd moments of artiness can't disguise an amateurish feel to the whole thing. One for fans only.",5,3,9,18 January 2004
The Lives of Others," A strange kind of comradeship
","Perhaps the most sinister feature of the communist states of eastern Europe was the way they made a reality of George Orwell's thought police, with networks of informers so extensive that no-one could ever trust their 'comrade', a hollow term indeed when you are considered an enemy of the state if you would not betray your friend to it. There are obvious parallels in McCarthyism; but the difference is one of scale. 'The Lives of Others' tells an entertaining, and ultimately moving, story set in East Germany's secret police. What I liked about the film is that it accepts the notion that everyone is compromised (and compromising) in some way in any society; compromise is what we do to survive. Again, the difference is in the degree, and this can change over time. What is less strong is the characterisation; it's not awful, and the lead protagonists do what is necessary to drive the plot, but I've seen deeper movies. Also, there is a lengthy epilogue after the film's emotional climax which seems to exist primarily to provide (unnecessary) feel-good vibes for the audience (structurally, there's a similarity to the ending of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in the way that this works). It's still a good film, both thought-provoking and enjoyable to watch; if the idea of collaboration interests you further, I recommend Kieslowski's early movies, particularly 'No End'.",8,1,2,6 March 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Bored of the rings again
","'The Lord of the Rings' is a much liked, but also widely derided book (aactually three books, just as it is now three films). It's not hard to see why both opinions are held. The narrative has epic sweep, but the moral motivations of the characters are simplistic in the extreme. They may be torn between good and evil, but these are presented as primeval, opposing forces: the concept of mixed motive scarcely exists. The much noted absence of sex from the book typifies this: it's not that the book would benefit from sexual content per se, rather that the heroic model of its universe cannot accommodate anything as challenging as the fusion of love and lust.Yet I actually like the book, with its rich descriptive language. In fact, the monsters and landscape so described were long considered unfilmable; but with the aid of modern computer graphics, Peter Jackson has achieved a visually perfect reconstruction of Middle Earth, with almost everything looking exactly as you imagined it from the text (though the orcs seem to be a little influenced by the 'Alien' with their ferocious, flashing teeth). The virtual Gollum is perhaps the most skillfully animated character of any yet rendered on screen. Yet there was another reason why the book should have been tricky to film, and this is the relationship of its the characters to history and time. The novel's best point, in my opinion, is the way that it conveys a sense of a vast, slow journey, one that criss-crosses the routes of a thousand past journeys that collectively have brought the present to pass. Stories are told, often in fragmentary form; and the end of the quest represents not just the end of the foregrounded tale, but the end of an fictional era, and the end of the reader's quest to understand that era as well. This is all essentially wordy stuff, narrative and dialogue, that does not just fill the spaces between the action points, but provides them with their context. And in spite of making his movie over nine full hours, Jackson seems to have been unable to find time for this, and the first film, as well as the first part of this instalment, precede as an unbroken series of fairly meaningless happenings, all spectacular but pointless. For example, when Frodo (the hero) visits the dead marshes, he needs to know how they came to be; otherwise, the fact he sees corpses lying below the water is just empty decoration. In Osgilliath, we see just a random ruined city, not understanding it was once the capital of Gondor. And so on. Jackson has been generally very faithful to Tolkein's plotting (though he takes a few liberties in the second half of this film), but this faithfulness takes the form of completism: almost every image from the book needs to be rendered, but if you don't already know the story, you might struggle to work out why.So although the description of travel was one of the very best things in the novel, this film actually improves in its second half, when the travelling slows or stops, and the story starts to feel less sequential. The changes to the plot, however, are not so successful, because where Jackson should have cut selectively, he has instead largely embellished the action, usually adding more melodrama than was present in the original. So all the heroes need to nearly die in battle; Farmair must be tempted by the ring, just as his brother Boromir was, and the heroes must join him when he fights his rearguard action in Osgilliath; Pippin and Merry must trick the ents into helping out, and so on. Quite why Jackson considered the story needed more incident is hard to fathom, especially as there's a shallow obviousness to this extra material. The emotional impact is further deadened by the decision to play every scene with music. The music is not awful or ill-chosen, but there's no contrast, and one cannot stay in state of heightened arousal for three hours at a stretch. This is a film for which you could make a terrific trailer; but when every scene is played as a climax, the cumulative effect is lessened, not increased. Indeed, the battle with Saruman is given an apocalyptic tone that seems to pre-empt the final part of the story; but this second movie two ends short of the second book, ignoring the potential of tremendous, pessimistic cliff-hanger with which Tolkein concluded his second part.In conclusion, the visuals are great. But the film misses what allows the book to transcend its peculiarities. If you like 'The Silmarillion' (Tolkein's more literary, sophisticated prequel), then this probably isn't for you.",5,0,1,19 November 2005
The Incredibles," Nicely executed, but actually one of Pixar's less incredible films
","I have to admit that I put off finishing this tale of superannuated superheroes for many years because of it's Randian overtones: Atlas involuntarily shrugged, if you like, with the vision of its evil villain a world where 'everyone is super, so no-one is'. The start of the movie is certainly fun, but it mocks a world recognise more in the 'polical correctness gone mad' stereotypes than the one I actually see around me. The message is thankfully tempered by the tendency of said heroes to actually cause disasters only marginally less severe than the ones they are saving people from, and the end of the film becomes more of a straightforward action movie, thankfully less solemn than the likes of Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' films but scarcely more absurd than a typical James Bond. There are good laughs (and typically stunning graphics) in this film, but overall, there's just a little less charm than in Pixar's finest offerings.",7,0,1,9 August 2013
Dog Day Afternoon," Amateur Dogs
","A startlingly young Al Pacino stars in this true-life story of a bank robbery gone wrong. The most famous recent film about a botched bank robbery was of course 'Reservoir Dogs', but the two movie could hardly be more different (except for the use of the word 'dog' in their titles!) - Quentin Tarantino's movie was stylised, ultra-violent, and told of gangsters, whereas this movie is realist in tone and features very little shooting, while Pacino's character is essentially just a mixed-up kid. He gives a fine performance, and director Sidney Lumet shows a sure touch in handling the tragi-comic unfolding of events; the longer the movie lasts, the more involving it becomes. If anything, the film better resembles Scorcese's under-appreciated gem, 'The King of Comedy', another story about the pursuit of dreams both modest and absurd. It's among the best things that Lumet and Pacino have done in their long careers, and a welcome reminder that the greater slickness one expects in a modern blockbuster does not necessarily make a better film.",Null,0,0,5 October 2006
Amadeus," Triumphantly musical
","Milos Forman's film of the life of Mozart is long, flamboyant, not especially subtle, defiantly unhistorical and above all else, triumphantly musical. It will tell you almost nothing about the real Mozart's life, but it is steeped in his work, which infuses the whole film with vitality and purpose. The only thing I didn't like was the way that Forman sidesteps the problem of making antique dialogue sound both plausible and fresh by having every word uttered in contemporary American, which never completely ceases to jar. Among the cast, I particularly enjoyed Jeffrey Jones (the emperor) and his display of understated stupidity; Muaary Abraham won Oscars as Salieri, but it's a showy role, albeit in a film that is showy, and wonderfully so.",9,0,1,2 September 2010
The Game," High Class Hokum
","'The Game' is the sort of film that Hollywood does best.  Michael Douglas plays Nicholas van Orton, a wealthy banker whose brother (Sean Penn) signs him up for a real-life game.  When the game proves not to be too much fun, and van Orton finds himself unable to stop it, the question of where the game begins and reality begins is not easily answered.  Director Fincher handles this material adroitly, ratcheting up the tension as van Orton fins himself in ever deeper trouble - but it's also very funny, the plot is preposterous, but enacted with such conviction that it keeps you gripped, even as you laugh at its sheer outrageousness.  Full marks must go to Douglas (a natural in the role), Penn (playing uncharacteristically nerdy) and Deborah Unger, excellent as a tough and sexy femme fatale.Fincher's films all seem to have a similar quality, films that dare you to take them seriously but which ultimately make fun of you if you do.  'Se7en' is senseless in terms of the motivation of its characters - 'Fight Club' appears at first to be a study of modern masculinity, but turns out to be just a very clever joke.  The key is to enjoy the joke, and the ride, at the same time - and in enabling the viewer to do this, 'The Game' is perhaps his most successful (and least pretentious) work.  I was riveted, and although it is nonsense, even moved by the end.  Great stuff!",9,1,2,7 March 2004
Kick-Ass," Too much 'bang' and 'slash', too little 'kerpow'
","The classic premise of many superhero movies is that an ordinary, even a wimpy sort of guy, has a second life thanks to his secret powers: think Spiderman, Superman or Batman. So the hilarious premise of 'Kick-Ass' is that a really ordinary guy decides to live a second life as a superhero, but without any super powers, and with predictably mixed results. And in places the film is funny. But a general feature of superhero movies is that the violence they feature is comic-book stuff, which enables the crime fighting vigilante to indeed be a hero, and not the altogether more ambiguous figure found, for example, in Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'. 'Kick-Ass', unfortunately, combines its comic presence with a lot of serious violence. It's deliberately overdone as opposed to realistic, but nonetheless, it still falls into a long family of movies that seem to tell us that ultra-violence is cool. Some people can pull this off through sheer verve (think Tarantino at his best), but generally, I find the fetishising of guns and swordplay tedious, and to me, this blunts the movie's comic edge. To me, 'Kick-Ass' was less than the sum of its parts; maybe I have no sense of humour, but bazookas don't make me laugh.",5,1,3,23 January 2014
Call Me by Your Name," Love and privelege
","With a screenplay by James Ivory, Luca Guadagnino's film 'Call me by your Name' is an account of a love affair between two Americans, an academic and another academic's son, while the two are staying together in Italy. Although the two lovers are male, and one is barely above the age of consent, neither of these points is the explicit subject of the movie, which instead concentrates on the physicality of love and the strange behaviours we have to learn and manifest in order to express it. On one had, our characters are enormously fortunate (materially, intellectually and in their own good looks); on the other, the way that love (and lust) wrongfoots yet delights them is expertly portrayed, as is the fact that the knowlege that this is a casual relationship cannot completely pre-empt the pain of breakup. This is not a film about the loveless; but there's an honesty in its portrayal that offsets any jealously you might otherwise feel at its protagonists' privelege.",8,1,1,29 June 2020
Hero," Stunning but empty
","The Chinese historical drama is a well defined genre, complete with fly-by-wire swordplay, and 'Hero' is a fairly typical example of the breed. It's beautiful, but stylised to the point of near-ridiculousness: it's maybe better to think of it as ballet than fiction. What is unusual about this movie is the plot, which is little more than a formal construct, and its nationalist ethic: this is a story about the foundation of China, although 'story' is pushing it, and the film is full of epigrammatic symbols that hint at profoundity but which may just be empty. I liked watching it, but at some level, it wouldn't have been so different an experience to view it without the subtitles, so limited is the substance.",6,0,1,10 July 2008
Shrek the Third," Shrek the King
","Some of the critics were less appreciative of 'Shrek the Third' than it's two predecessors, but there's still plenty to enjoy, notably the rich sequence of jokes bound together by a reasonably coherent plot (based, as before, on the world of fairy-tales). And while the Shrek movies are not the most mordant of modern animated cartoons, the film explores, albeit in comic vein, the question of what makes us act the way we do and does not divide its characters into absolute categories of black-and-white (with the exception of the only true villain, who, entertainingly, is Prince Charming!). It should also be noted quite how high the standard of computer animation is, which allows mood and humour to be conveyed through the use of relatively subtle body language; most remarkable is the character of Puss-in-Boots, whose moves are a perfect combination of feline and human. It's not (for an adult, at least), a life-changing movie; but it is great fun.",8,1,1,16 September 2007
The Hurt Locker," War as entertainment
","Kathryn's Bigelow's film 'The Hurt Locker' tells the story of a bomb disposal engineer in Iraq. It's long, but consistently gripping: however, does it deserve the hatful of Oscars it won? War films are hardly scarce, after all, and much of the basic narrative here is familiar, including the sense of alienation from civilian life felt by hardened soldiers. And aspects of this movie just didn't ring true for me. Most accounts of war tell of long periods of tedium interspersed by odd moments of acute fear and danger; but in this film, whenever the bomb disposal squad get a new mission, there's someone trying to kill them as they undertake it, or at the very least some idiot with an inexplicable desire to walk into the barrel of a gun. Post-war Iraq was (and sadly remains) a dangerous place; but overall, U.S. casualty rates are not as high (I think) as this film suggests. And the absence of any interest in why the war was fought, or in why some Iraqis might have wanted Americans dead, feels like a mistake: instead, we get countless set piece scenes of the heroes against the gooks - the fact that it's bomb disposal, rather than infantry fighting, that's nominally the subject, doesn't change this in any fundamental way. Perhaps I was unfortunate to watch this at the same time as I was reading Karl Maplantes 'Matterhorn', a novel set in the Vietnam war; that seems truthful and shocking to me, where this film seems more like entertainment. A cynic might suggest this is actually why the Oscars were won.",7,0,2,8 January 2012
No Man's Land," Stronger psychologically than politically
","The premise of 'No Man's Land' is simple: enemy soldiers stuck inside the same trench beneath their opposing lines. The setting is the Bosnian war, and the start of the film is vaguely reminiscent of the films of Emir Kusturica: less wild, but raw and to the point: I believed in the characters. But in the second half of the film, the movie turns it's attention from Serbs and Bosnians to the French and the British; and here I found it less successful. And this is not because western Europeans deserve no censure: in the real war, the U.N. did indeed stand aside while the massacre at Srebenica took place. But the pantomime general on display here does not help us understand how that happened; and the journalist is also an uncomfortable character. Put simply, the way that she reports the news, both inane and emotional, simply isn't how news is done in the real world. T.V. news reporting can be parodied - Chris Morris, among others, has done so superbly in the past - but mimicry is perhaps a prerequisite of good parody: the ability to replicate the tone is what buys the freedom to exaggerate. Although 'Welcome to Serejevo' was perhaps overly sympathetic to its journalistic protagonist, I felt it captured more of the essence of the truth of being a war reporter than this film. And after finding 'No Man's Land's portrayals of its English characters unconvincing, do I then have to ask myself, should I trust its portrayals of its Balkan protagonists? Even the film's final message seems confused, for having mocked the U.N. for not intervening, when it does intervene, things end in inevitable disaster, meaning that that paradoxically, it could almost be seen as an unintentional endorsement of realpolitik. I still enjoyed watching this movie; but its psychology is definitely stronger than its politics.",7,2,4,2 November 2008
Moulin Rouge!," Mad world
","Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' was a brilliant blend of Shakespeare and a decidedly modern sensibility. 'Moulin Rouge!', that film's successor, is a less-grounded and rather more self-indulgent affair, a voracious monster that gobbles up just about every influence it can lay its hands and spits them out as a spectacle of sound and noise so overwhelming that at times it seems that the screen can barely contain it. Luhrmann's interweaving of fragmented images and songs is dizzying and dazzling and very self-aware, delighting in its deliberate anachronisms. The editing is perhaps the most manic yet seen in cinema, which sometimes supports but at other time smothers some the film's nicest tricks, like the deft choreography (and not just in the dance numbers) that were one of the pleasures of 'Romeo + Juliet'. One could hardly call it monotone, but one can almost for just a little bit of metaphorical black-and-white to offset the extravagant colour.Ewan MacGregor does his usual stuff, Nicole Kidman is excellent in the most demanding role and I also enjoyed the relatively understated performance of Richard Roxburgh as the malevolent Duke. The plot resembles that of 'Shakespeare in Love' (which of course was also based on Romeo and Juliet), and also contains a definite nod to 'Strictly Ballroom', Luhrman's breakthrough feature. There are also no original songs, the joke lies the way that the familiar is recycled into something shiny and new (and if you've seen the film, you'll get the allusion in that last sentence). Yet the fact the soul of the film is so well reflected in pop songs also indicates a certain level of triteness. For all its pomp and magnificence, when the hero and heroine sum up their tale in a simple chorus, you're left with the feeling that there really hasn't been anything deeper than this at any point in the movie.You can file this film along with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut' as a modern attempt at revitalising the big screen musical. 'Moulin Rouge' is certainly amazing; but the fact that you're unlikely to see another film like it is probably something of which you'll be glad.",8,3,4,21 November 2004
The Illusionist," Illusory entertainment
","Neil Bunger's 'The Illusionist' most naturally compares with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', two large-budget films about turn-of-the-20th century magicians that came out at around the same time. Neither film is perfect. At times, 'The Prestige' felt unduly mechanical; 'The Illusionist', on the other hand, is arguably easier entertainment, but is in places corny, I don't really understand the bizarre range of accents heard in what is supposedly Viena (some actors speak in a Gemranic English, while others speak pure American) and the plot, though entrancing up to a point, doesn't quite make sense. 'The Prestige' pushed plausibility, and even invented its own laws of physics to explain its story, but it was internally consistent (and indeed, like most good stories, a story of dealing with constraints). 'The Ilusionist' appears, on the other hand, to rely on what seems like genuine magic: at the end, one of the leading characters has a sudden revelation as to how it was done, but the explanation still leaves a lot unanswered. In some ways, films like this one suffer a problem: they leave too little to the imagination. One goes to a show, one thinks one knows what one has seen, and the 'magic' is that we have been tricked into having failed to grasp what has really happened. But the neutral, third-person point-of-view of a film seems to make a definitive statement as to what has occurred, so making illusion concrete and at the same time fantastical. This is a flawed film; but still an entertaining one.",7,0,0,9 April 2012
Transformers," All about the product
","A car that turns into a robot. Great idea for a toy; not such a great idea for a film. But the toy was conceived with the idea of it being marketed by a television series; that gave rise to an animated film; and now to this live action remake. If the film was pure sci-fi, it might not be too bad; but the attempt to make a partially human-centric story around these devices, in a semi-real world context, is disastrous, featuring by turn ridiculousness, clichés and product placement (and not just of the Transformers themselves); the film borrows from the conventions of thriller, teen movie and knowing comedy without offering any originality or coherence as it does so. What are on offer are a lot of spectacular special effects, but watching the robots fight over skyscrapers I was reminded of the original 'King Kong'. The special effects of that film were then cutting edge, but now seem primitive; yet the reality depicted in this movie is no more convincing, in spite of the modern graphics, so divorced are the images from any sense of meaning. You can make a fun movie about fighting aliens: 'Independence Day' is a good example, but the concept of 'Transformers' lies wholly in the product, and the narrative justification we get is stretched very thin. If this really is what Hollywood currently considers as premium movie-making, we can only hope that our descendants will first damn, and then forgive us.",2,4,9,11 January 2008
Lincoln," Hagiographic, but Day-Lewis is predictably excellent
","Americian opposition to slavery in the south was initially mainly founded on the fears of northerners of economic competition, rather than lofty thoughts about the rights of man. As a politician, Abraham Lincoln had to broker compromise with many factions to win power, stay in power and (after a refusal to compromise led to civil war) to ultimately lead the country on a path back to peace. As ever when compromise has to be made, one can question whether the decision has been made for the best. Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' explores some of these questions but in a not altogether satisfactory manner: the President we meet in this film is unquestionably both good and wise at all times. One would learn more respect for Lincoln in a story which at least offered us alternative narratives, ones in which Lincoln's behaviour or motives could be faulted. That said, Daniel Day Lewis is (somewhat predictably) excellent in the lead role, although it's not the first film I've seen him dominate while the rest of the cast genuflects. For a long movie, it's bravely talk-y, and as someone with a strong interest in politics, I liked the film. What it doesn't really do is explain why anyone else (whether abolitionist or confederate) was ever opposed to him.A final point: to convey Lincoln's death (he was shot in a theatre) with a scene which shows news of his assassination being conveyed to another theatre seems a decision so strange I find it impossible to understand.",8,0,1,19 April 2016
Pi," Life of Pi
","Daniel Aronofsky's brilliantly deranged thriller, 'Pi', is the story of a mathematician losing his mind. With its black-and-white photography, jerky editing, and 1970s aesthetic, the film creates a mood of tension, paranoia and plain confusion reminiscent of that found in the books of James Keleman or in Christopher Nolan's backwards-told 'Momento'; while the plot, though deliberately incoherent, takes the form of a Jewish version of the 'Da Vinci code', or 'Foccault's Pendulum'. Sean Gullette is excellent in the main role, and for affectionados of the game Go (often used in movies as a visual metaphor for genius), there's an added bonus of several Go-playing scenes. Disturbing, pseudo-intellectual fun at its best.",8,0,1,30 January 2005
Kelly's Heroes," Funny, uncompromising
","The cynical, anarchic spirit of 'Catch-22' is alive and well in 'Kelly's Heroes', an entertaining romp about a group of soldiers who attempt to rob a bank during the closing days of world war two. Aided by a cracking script from Troy Kennedy Martin (better known in Britain for 'Edge of Darkness' and, improbably, 'Dr. Who', but who also scripted the not dissimilar 'Italian Job'), the film manages to reflect the genuine horrors of war, work as a tense thriller, and induce laughter simultaneously. Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland are both great value, and there's thankfully little screen time for Clint Eastwood (the eponymous Kelly, whom he plays with his usual, tiresome ultra-cool hardman act). Personally, I felt the story could have done with one final plot twist; but in any event, it's still one of the better war films made, for in spite (or maybe even because) of the comedy, it conveys a real sense of what it might be like to fight, and die, without one shred of sanctimoniousness.",9,5,7,11 September 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Girls don't fight
","I recently read the late F.X. Toole's only novel, 'Pound for Pound'; but watch 'Million Dollar Baby', derived from an earlier short story of Toole's, and you enter exactly the same world, that of seedy gyms occupied by old men for whom life is boxing, and boxing is life. The twist in this tale is that the central boxer is a woman; although the meaning of title eventually becomes apparent in a way you don't at first suspect. However, I found the film a little short on back story, the lead male characters (played by director Clint Eastwood, and fellow veteran Morgan Freeman) seem weary without explanation; sighing, which both are good at, is not in itself a sign of profundity. And rather as it did in 'The Shawshank Redemption', Morgan's narration softens the movie, which in fact is surprisingly unvisceral for a story about fighting. Likewise, the issue of how a woman finds social acceptance as a boxer is skirted; Hilary Swank's character feels more at home here than she does anywhere else, although we learn nothing of how she came to discover that boxing was her thing. Of course, in many ways, this film is better for not being 'Rocky'; but I still wonder, did it have to be quite so low-key?",6,2,7,6 February 2008
Garden State," Beautiful girls
","The plot of Zach Braff's film 'Garden State' resembles that of Jonathan Demme's 'Beautiful Girls' (and in fact, I wrote this comment without remembering that Natalie Portman features in both movies); a vaguely-artistic type returns to the town he grew up in, to find himself at a time when his life seems lost. Braff's vision of New Jersey is quirky but skilfully realised, and the acting isn't bad either. However, it's also an affluent, idealised world which seems to contain no cause for the characters' existential angst; while a back story is provided, explaining this in personal terms, there never seems to be any fundamental obstacle to an inevitable happy ending. The use of every pretty-dippy folk-pop song you've ever heard, to guide our moods through the plot, maybe hints at a certain weakness in the naked story. My other criticism with this film is that everyone looks beautiful. The use of good-looking actors is standard in movies, partly because everyone likes to see a pretty girl (or guy), but also because an actor of exceptional beauty can command the viewer's attention in the same way that someone we are really in love with does (regardless of their physical beauty) - in other words, we wouldn't necessarily fall for our own loved ones on screen (or at least, not so easily). This may be an acceptable trick, but a world where everyone is good-looking loses contact with reality. The result is a sensitive, well-acted drama with some original elements that nonetheless resembles an episode of 'Hollyoaks'. It's easy viewing, but also a tale of superficial darkness lying on an essentially bright world.",7,0,1,11 January 2009
Donnie Brasco," Gangster movie No. 1
","In a world filled with overheated, and frequently overpraised, gangster movies, it seems to me that Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco', the story of a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob, is arguably overlooked. Based on real life events, it contains great performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, a complex but coherent plot, addresses universal themes (divided loyalties, the evolution of human relationships and behaviour) and the ending is genuinely moving. Perhaps it's not fast-paced enough for devotees of the genre; more likely it 'fails' this audience for its very success in portraying the mafia as fundamentally pathetic, whereas most gangster pictures at least partly buy into the glamorous myth. But for me, this a superior film to Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', with a faint note of very black comedy that sounds behind the slaughter. Recommended.",9,93,118,26 May 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Nicely adapted, but dull
","There were some good things about Steig Larsson's bestselling thriller, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo': it was readable, there was a well constructed socio-political backdrop, and the core plot was an cleverly constructed variant of that old chestnut, the closed room mystery, with a solid detective story to eventually unpick it. There were also some things I disliked: the story was supposedly written to highlight male violence against women, but arguably revelled in such violence itself and then 'balanced' this by equally grisly elements of revenge; the author's relentless plugging of Apple Macs was tedious and devoid of novelistic purpose; the central male character appeared to be a highly flattering portrait of the author's alter ego; while the central female character, Soljander, appeared to be pretty much whatever the author wanted her to be at each moment of the story, sexy and unsexy by turn, and a miraculously brilliant computer hacker to boot. Also, the taut central plot ultimately dissolved into something much more gruesome, but also less convincing. This (Swedish) film version (the first of two, the other made by Hollywood) gets some things right, most notably through its interpretations of the leading roles. Soljander here seems more coherent and thereby interesting, than she does in the book. But the book's greatest strength, its procedural detail, is harder to follow, and the director tends to rather spell out the meaning to compensate. The greatest failing, however, is shared with the book, and it's simply that the story is wildly over-complex, Larsson had a clutch of interesting ideas but maybe lacked the confidence to trust just one; either that, or he correctly judged the public appetite for wild, over-the-top tales. I've seen worse thrillers; but I have to say, I found this one dull.",4,4,10,6 February 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A taste of another time
","George Clooney takes only a minor role in 'Good Night and Good Luck', his second film as a director, which from my perspective is a blessing; I definitely prefer him behind the camera, for the movie is an atmospheric invocation of another time, when journalists of integrity promoted cigarettes and the terrible Senator Joeseph McCarthy sought to ruin the lives of anyone who had even the faintest connection with communism. David Strathairn is excellent as Ed Murrow, one journalist who eventually took McCarthy on (although I have heard it said that he waited till the peak of his opponent's power had passed before striking), but who couldn't defeat the rise of television's relentless commercial ethic. As a film, it's not quite the equal of 'All the President's Men': telling only the story of McCarthy's downfall, we never quite get the sense of how mighty he was, or the true level of bravery involved in confronting him; and McCarthy is a man with whom it is quite impossible to sympathise from a modern perspective. But the effectiveness of Clooney's recreation of the 1950s means that it's a gripping tale, in spite of the relative weakness of plot.",8,0,0,29 January 2009
Mulholland Drive," Davie goes to Hollywood
","In Mullholland Drive, David Lynch has directed not only a highlight of his personal career, but also one of the first seminal films of the 21st century.  The strengths and interests of this film will be familiar to his admirers; but never has he carried them off with such aplomb.  So we have small-town cookie-ness, taboo sexuality, nods to the 50s, downright weirdness, and the semi-supernatural; and all filmed beautifully, paced without hurry, Lynch's L.A. is still not bustling, but rather still, a slow-moving hypnotic lure.  Add in some very funny movie-industry satire, and a deliciously complex plot, and one has the makings of a classic.  Yet in spite of this, the question remains: is it any good?This is a tale of two parallel and contradictory stories, each involving the same pair of women, one seeming to both pre- and post-date the other.  The tease is enchanting, but before the film ends, one realises there will be no resolution in the conventional sense.  The first time one sees this film, one is partly impressed, and partly dissatisfied, thinking perhaps, Mullholland Drivel?You may have heard various 'explanations' for this film, attempts to make it all make 'sense'.  But even these need caveats and riders, and the advice basically boils down to this: don't trust anything (which is hardly 'sensible' in any meaningful sense).  It may be interesting to understand what Lynch was trying to do, to understand why this film has this particular shape (and not any other); but that doesn't make the finished work coherent. But perhaps also, this is missing the point.  From Sunset Boulevard onwards, cinema keeps revisiting the lurid hills of Hollywood.  Mullholland Drive is simply the most beguiling journey yet.",8,0,1,26 January 2003
Grave of the Fireflies," Beautiful and human
","I haven't seen a more beautiful animation than 'Grave of the Fireflies'. Not only is the imagery gorgeous, but the scenes are composed and arranged with the same care as seen in the best of art-house movies; and the horror of the fire-bombing of Japanese cities (seen by some as sufficiently terrible to make the nuclear option a morally superior alternative) is fully conveyed. In fact, this is such a serious movie (in all senses of that word) that it begs the question: why was it made as an animation at all, and not as a conventional film? Perhaps the answer is that in the flesh, it might have been so sad as to be unwatchable; at the end of the day, this is simply a story about two people who starve to death. Indeed, the film even begins with a (strictly unnecessary) flash-forward, as if the director did not want to betray any hopes we might otherwise have mustered of a happy ending. Raymond Briggs's 'When the Wind Blows' obviously comes to mind, but this film is broader in scope: it's as much about social breakdown as the war itself. The fireflies, a metaphor for lost souls, linger on in the mind.",8,1,2,28 February 2010
8 Mile," Scenes from the underbelly of America
","When pop stars make films, these are often based of fictionalised versions of themselves, and Eminem's effort, '8 Mile', is no exception. But there are some things that make this movie more intriguing than most in the genre: firstly, his life story, a white kid growing up in a poor, mostly black district of Detroit who became a major rap star, is genuinely interesting; secondly, the director, Curtis Hanson, is a cut above the typical director of such an effort. And the film delivers on most of this promise: Eminem actually acts quite well, and the decayed environment of urban Detroit is a grimly fascinating slice of America relatively rarely depicted in the movies. As for the rapping, even if you don't like this music in general (and it's aggressive, misogynistic tendencies are very much on display), the idea of tongue-tied street kids finding their voice in spontaneous performance makes for an entertaining narrative. The film is quite long, however, and a little shapeless - unlike Eminem's real life story, there's no fairytale ending. The film obviously needed a real rapper to make it work, but this is no empty star vehicle, but a grimy and unglamourous film about life on the underside of the U.S.A.",7,1,2,6 November 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A clever person's stupid movie
","The trademarks of Quentin Tarantino's movies are well known: smart dialogue; self-awareness of popular culture (from the banal to the arcane); cinematographic innovation; ultra-violence; and a pervading air of cool. After the runaway success of his first two movies, his third film 'Jackie Brown' traded some excess of these qualities for a bit of conventional characterisation: I liked the result, although hardcore fans were disappointed. But for his fourth film, Tarantino has moved in the opposite direction. 'Kill Bill', a homage to Asian martial-arts films, sees Tarantino at his most stylised, and is as stupid as its name. The wafer thin-plot sees a female assassin out to kill those who wronged her; and little happens except for an improbable sequence of slayings. The sad thing is that there are many little touches that delight in this movie, Tarantino has not lost his mastery of the art of film-making (at least, not in the detail); but devoid of any rational context, it adds up only to showing off with blood. While Uma Thurman, in the lead role, is wooden, failing to convey either human emotion or cartoon menace. What's really unforgivable, however, is that instead of dazzling us with a quick punch, Tarantino made a film so long that, in spite of its essential vacuity, it had to be split into two movies to make it a commercial proposition. And I'm really not sure I'll be bothering with volume two.",5,5,9,12 May 2007
A Bug's Life," A semi-wonderful life
","'A Bug's Life' lacks the mordancy that made the humour of 'Toy Story' so appealing to adults; but there's still much to enjoy in this animated film. The cutesy heroes are pretty bland, but the evil grasshoppers are wonderfully brought to life, the asynchronous movement of their multiple limbs a joy to behold.  The real thing that's lacking here, certainly compared to 'Wallace and Grommit' (but 'Toy Story' also), is a sense of pacing: as if the film-makers lack the courage to let you simply marvel at their vivid creations, the film is action-packed but fairly monotonous in mood; and again unlike 'Toy Story', the viewer's perception of the characters is not shifted during the course of the film.  These may sound like very 'adult' considerations; but the best animations can appeal to the child in us all.  'A Bug's Life' is superficial even for a children's tale; but fun nonetheless.",7,0,1,11 April 2004
The Insider," The corporate law
","In general, I'm not a huge fan of the films of Michael Mann, finding them unsubtle; and I delayed watching 'The Insider' for precisely that reason. A film about a heroic whistle-blower fighting against the evils of big tobacco: it sounds like a black and white story. And there are certain clichÃ©s in this movie: the selfish wife, for example, who doesn't stand by her husband when he can no longer provide for her in the style to which she was accustomed (although I fear that in one scene, where she contemplates the awful possibility that she might have to go out to work, that the audience is actually being encouraged to sympathise with her). And yet the first two thirds of this movie is really strong. Mann gets his A-list cast to justify their salaries, none more so than Russel Crowe as the whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigland, who displays a character he doesn't often show: nerdy, insecure, un-self confident, torn between conscience and self-interest. Precisely because Wigland is not obviously a wonderful (or indeed a terrible) human being, but an ordinary man, the story is more interesting; and black-and-white or not, the story of such an individual fighting the huge power of corporate America is terrifying and brilliantly told. I was gripped; but the last third of the movie doesn't quite have the same power. Partly it's because we see the same story again, now within a news organisation thinking about broadcasting an interview with Wigland. But however passionately the journalists care about the story, it's hard to believe that this is their fight in quite the same way it's Wiglands, some themes are repetitive, and the idea that a news organisation should make its decisions without commercial considerations is frankly nonsense; every journalist gets their salary only because someone is prepared to pay for the product, and I find it hard to believe that this is the only time that C.B.S. news has fallen beneath a standard of 100% purity. In this final part, Mann orchestrates more scenes with big music, perhaps because there a less powerful drama beneath it. Moreover, it's never completely clear what exactly is unique about Wigland's information. Yet for three hours, Mann made me share in his characters' well justified fear of persecution. That's an achievement; and this (in my opinion) is his best film.",8,1,2,7 November 2010
The Dark Knight," Darkness and light
","He's back, the Bat-man, the superhero whose most defining super-power is that he is super-rich. The second instalment of Christopher Nolan's trilogy has much in common with its predecessor and successor: unnecessary length and over-complex plot (with at least three principal villains), spectacular special effects (even if one cannot always follow what exactly is happening, it looks as if it ought to be exciting) and fantastic technologies introduced into the story for the sole reason that they would look good if realised. The mood is dark rather than comic, but mood is all there is. This was the film famous for the appearance of a soon-to-die Heath Ledger as the Joker, traditionally the most comic of Batman's foes. While Ledger does a good job of interpreting his character as a figure of real menace - his plaudits were well-earned - it's an absurd amount of effort into making something vaguely real from a comic book scribble. I actually enjoyed 'Batman Begins', almost in spite of myself; but the flimsy central conceit can't really handle the weight of implied consequence laden on its sequels. The film is called 'The Dark Night'; and sadly, in spite of its superior execution, is missing any essential lightness of touch.",6,1,2,3 January 2015
Everest," Characters lost in the scenery
","High altitude mountaineering is incredibly dangerous, and was once the preserve only of the most brilliant, and dedicated, climbers. But in a world where rich people look for the ultimate experience, some climbers have found they can make a living by guiding lesser mortals to the highest summits, none more desired than the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. We know now what this has led to: queues of people on the highest point on earth, and periodic tragedy. And a big question is what it really means to 'guide' under conditions so extreme, where anyone can lose their sense of reason under shortage of oxygen, and when demented ambition and fierce storms can wreck the best laid plans. In 1996, high altitude guiding was relatively new when tragedy struck the parties of guides Rob Hall and Scott Fisher. The presence of journalist Jon Krakauer in Hall's party ensured that the story was well-told; 'Everest' is in fact the second movie based on Krakauer's book. It's a higher budget affair than its predecessor, and a little less corny, but essentially very similar. Perhaps it brings out some of the individual stories a little less strongly, although the visuals are predictably stunning. Twenty years on, it's hard to know the right solution; but also hard not to conclude that people are very bad at calculating odds.",7,0,2,26 July 2019
Into the Wild," Long and simplified
","In 1992, 24-year old Chris McCadless set off into the wilds of Alaksa where he died of starvation. Some press coverage presented him as a foolish young adventurer; but in his thoughtful book, 'Into the Wild', author John Krakauer showed how McCandless mostly knew what he was doing, and was perhaps unlucky to perish. Moreover, interpolating from McCandless's life and his own feelings as a young man, Krakauer inferred that Chris was engaged in a serious quest to find a meaningful way of living, a quest not completely invalidated by the fact that it ended in a particularly nasty death. Sean Penn's film of the book captures some of this, but it's a long movie (given that most viewers probably know the ending before it starts), and Penn makes choices that don't exactly betray the spirit of the book but which do simplify it, emphasising McCandless's family problems, making his experiences seem almost ecstatic, and replacing Krakauer's narration with a sister to whom he gives an almost gnomic sense of wisdom. I would also have been tempted to cast a less attractive actor in the leading role, and in other roles too: the weight of the story is undermined slightly by the prevalence of Hollywood looks. It's still an interesting as well as a tragic story; but I think the book told it better.",6,4,6,24 November 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," A ballet in space
","Surely the oddest blockbuster ever made, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a testament both to the remarkable ambition of its director, Stanley Kubrick, and also to the spirit of an age.  Unlike almost every other science fiction film before or since, Kubrick chooses to play it slow, building an atmosphere instead of spoiling us with action: spaceships (presumably plastic models, in an age preceding computer-made effects) dance ballets while the phenomenon of zero-gravity is represented in a manner that would surely have been familiar to M. C. Escher.  With immense audacity, Kubrick allows  us almost no dialogue for the first half an hour (except for a few words spoken by, of all people, Leonard Rossiter!); and throughout the film, he conspires masterfully against his audience, daring to keep us in the dark about what is really going on.  It does have to be said that the ending inspires David Lynch style misgivings (the final revelation is only that there is no resolution); but as with a Lynch film, this film transcends the logical purpose of plot.The film is also interesting because of when it was made, just before the first moon landings, in an age when optimism in technological progress was probably at its height.  It's easy to laugh at the dated aesthetics of 'the future' as rendered in this film, but also mistaken: the whole point is that '2001' is not set in 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away' but in a medium term that is in fact already past.  Man made it to the moon within just 24 years of inventing the jet engine: '2001' represents an imaginative peek beyond the limits our (then apparently rapidly expanding) horizons. That willingness to look beyond is what lifts the film above cheap futurology and keeps it fresh, even in 2004.  Arguably Kubrick's best film.",8,1,3,10 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Partial recall
","Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote the wonderfully surreal 'Being John Malkovich', and he's at it again in 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', a similarly bizarre tale. To classify (wholly unfairly) it as genre, it's a romantic sci-fi (and how many of those do you see?), set in a world where disillusioned lovers can have their memories of each other erased. There's plenty of natural material in this concept, but unfortunately, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry are arguably guilty of trying a little too hard: the middle section of the movie takes place inside the characters' brains, for no real purpose in terms of plot: the film fills this logical vacuum with some evocative cinematography, but its impact is lessened because the film-makers have first licensed themselves to show anything they want. What they do get right, in combination with the leads, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett, is to show real (positive and negative) chemistry between the protagonists; if anything, at times they appear almost too adorable, but at least there's a spark. And although daft, the film is wholly watchable and actually not bad at manipulating the viewer's emotions; but perhaps Kaufman didn't need to make his script jump through quite so many hoops.",7,1,4,1 October 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," From spaghetti to Noodles!
","Sergio Leone, best known as the godfather of spaghetti Westerns, here makes a film about a gangster called Noodles. With its broad historical sweep, achronological story lines, three hour-plus runtime and generous score (written by longtime collaborator Ennio Morricone), it's nothing if not ambitious. Indeed, some of the balletic collages of music and images in this movie resemble no other film more than '2001: A Space Oddysey', which is certainly not something you can say of most gangster movies. Unfortuantly, the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong as the imagery, the conclusion to the plot doesn't quite convince (or indeed, pack a big enough punch to wholly satisfy after a movie of this length), and at times the film seems almost to endorse its central characters' crude, and sometimes sexually violent, world view. It features a handsome leading couple in Robert de Niro and Elisabeth McGovern; but it's a shame that its substance is not as distinctive as the style.",5,21,42,24 January 2007
Toy Story 2," Beyond infinity!
","These days, every film Pixar makes is hailed as a masterpiece, based on the winning formula of sophisticated computer animation and lots of jokes that parents can get as well. But many of these films could have been made using conventional techniques, and although the jokes may be sly, the basic premise of the plot is frequently dull and familiar: heroic, cute outsider wins the day and gets the girl. In my books, more recent efforts fail to truly match the original 'Toy Story'. The uniqueness of 'Toy Story' is based on two things. Firstly, that the plot depends on switching between two levels of reality (the toys, who are the leading characters, lie passive as their owner plays with them but (just as we all liked to imagine they did) play among themselves when the children aren't around). Being able to assimilate this fantasy world within a real-looking environment is this central to the film. And secondly, mapped to an adult domain, the subject matter of 'Toy Story' is actually desperately bleak: what we have is an allegory for human obsolescence and death, and the delusional strategies we employ to hide from this unbearable truth. One feels for these toys, even though they win out in both of the two movies, because we know that in the end, there is only the promise of inevitable defeat.'Toy Story 2' isn't quite as fresh as the mould-breaking original, but the scriptwriters have done a good job of taking its ideas forward, adding new levels of self-awareness (and self-referencing) to the plot. The jokes are good, the morbid streak remains, the only down-side is that we now expect all our animations to look this good. Together with its predecessor, it probably represents the most subversive film Disney have ever made, and a movie even Uncle Scrooge will enjoy.",9,0,1,23 April 2005
Selma," A struggle in microcosm
","The metaphorical march to justice is a slow one; but a significant step was taken on an actual march, from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama in 1965, when a public protest triggered action that finally allowed black Americans to vote, after many years in which they had been prevented from doing so. You could hardly go wrong in telling this story, a microcosm of the broader civil rights campaign: in this drama, you have many of the major figures in the wider battle: George Wallace, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, and of course, the charismatic Martin Luther King, who naturally takes centre stage in this movie. He's quite well brought to life by David Olelowo, who certainly looks the part and acts it convincingly (though the film mostly elides his private life). Tom Wilkinson is slightly less successful as Johnson, a more generic politician than the larger-than-life figure who emerges from Robert Caro's biography. Even though the narrative is straightforward: a fierce and violent struggle, then the good guys win, there's still something very moving when the story reaches its conclusion. But in the age of 'Black Lives Matter' and the presidency of Donald Trump, maybe also shocking at how much still needs to be done.",8,1,4,5 October 2017
The Artist," Delightful
","I'm a big fan of movies I would describe as realist, and liked many of the films made under the Dogme95 manifesto (which was all about not using certain artificial techniques). And when I look at old movies, it often strikes me how clumsy and un-natural they feel. Yet stick a camera in front of real life and its unlikely that the edited footage would ever be worth watching. All film-making is art and artifice; they may be different (technology- or self-imposed constraints), and a different impact desired, but the film that appears realistic is just one possible style. Viewed in this light, new technology makes new styles possible; but can also lead to the abandonment of art-forms that had their own validity and purpose in favour of the shock of the new. And 'The Artist' proves this: a modern day film, made in the style of a black-and-white, silent movie that manages to be funny and emotionally affecting in spite of the director's deliberate choice to ignore the advances that (mostly) mean that films like this one simply aren't made anymore.Self-referentially, the film takes the end of the silent movie era as its own subject; of course, this is not an unknown theme in Hollywood (think 'Sunset Boulevard', for example, although the back-story in that film is the primary narrative in this one). It's clever, but not just in a show-off way; what's noticeable is the attention paid to the smallest of details (for example, in the fonts in the movie posters on display); of course, there are talkies where the director has clearly worried over every visual detail, but in this film, it's obviously essential, and they can be enjoyed without competition. Director Michel Hazanavicius and male lead Jean Dujardin appear to have a great understanding of the positive qualities of silent movies (aside from the absence of sound). This isn't the deepest movie you'll ever see, but it's one of the most delightful. And when Berenice Bojo smiles her flapper smile, I challenge anyone not to feel a ripple in their hearts.",9,3,7,3 May 2014
Life Is Beautiful," Almost beautiful
","Roberto Benigni, the Italian Chaplin, has made, in 'Life is Beautiful', a comedy about the holocaust.  Which first begs the question: is it acceptable to do such a thing?  To which the answer must be 'yes'.  Often the best (and most unsettling) comedy is the blackest, in which the intertwining of the funny and the tragic makes us consider afresh the absurdity of life and death.  And the holocaust, sadly, was horrific precisely because by the fact that it happened it proved that such events do fall within the range of human behaviour. If, in remembering the holocaust, we can only do so with solemnity, we put it in a mausoleum outside of the rest of human experience; and are thereby less, not more, likely to understand and remember.But this leads onto a second question: is it possible to make a comedy about the holocaust (or at any rate a good one)?  Here the sheer scale of the awfulness makes a positive answer harder to give: for such a film to work, the comedy must be commensurate with the tragedy; and this perhaps cannot be done.  An earlier (and brilliant) film of Benigni's, 'Johnny Stecchino', poked fun at gangsters: but even then, it was working with stereotyped gangsters as depicted in movies, not at real murderers extinguishing human life.  With the holocaust, there is no such get outs: few have even dared make straight movies about this subject.The first half of 'Life is Beautiful' is a classic Benigni romp, poking some gentle fun at the less extreme excesses of Italian fascism as it proceeds. It's silly but good, a story of inescapable charm.  But in the second half, the scene moves to somewhere like Auschwicz, and the film becomes more problematic.  The idea (of a man who uses humour to save his son, and himself, from confronting the true horror of his situation) has some merit but is ultimately not sustainable in the face of reality.  So the film has to tone down reality.  Benigni is treated rather better than the average Auschwicz inmate (the film nowhere implies just how low the survival rate was); his fellow prisoners are shown as faceless zombies (distancing us when they do get killed); while when the subject of mass murder is directly addressed, the film inevitably slumps into mawkishness.  There are still some good gags, and occasionally some telling moments (particularly those involving a 'humane' doctor who Beningi befriends); but overall the setting rings false.  The film might have achieved more poignancy and realism had it been set in a pre-deportation Jewish ghetto: by going all the way to the death camps, it overplays its hand.'Life is Beautiful' is still a funny and original film; but actually less brave than you might at first think.",8,3,7,23 May 2004
Up," A real movie
","'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films.",9,1,2,27 January 2013
The Fly," Does one thing well
","Most science fiction films are big on ideas and special effects, but weak on coherence and character development; most horror films are just the same, except without the ideas. But David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' takes one simple idea, develops it properly, and eschews (its genuinely terrifying) special effects until its truly horrific climax. And by paying some attention to the personalities of its protagonists, it actually makes you care about them (Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock. The mix amounts to a gruesomely good film.",8,149,188,7 June 2005
From Hell," Ugly beautiful
","Adapted from a comic book, The Hughes' brothers film 'From Hell' is arguably more faithful to its origins than any other of its type. That is to say, the whole movie unfolds like a series of storyboards, the scenes may technically be animated but you can mentally crystallise each one into a handful of definitive images. Darkly Gothic, ultra-violent yet also quiet, the film has also a very well defined aesthetic sense, one arguably more pervasive than that in any of the movies of Tim Burton (with which some stylistic comparison can be made, although 'From Hell', unlike Burton's movies, is utterly lacking in whimsy). It also has a stellar British cast (Ian Holm is especially good value) supporting its leading (American) actors; who, sadly, cannot quite manage the cockney accent as required. Moreover, the usually charismatic Johnny Depp for once fails to leave sufficient impression, and his double act with sidekick Robbie Coltrane is surprisingly lacking in fire on both sides. Additionally, a little of the dialogue is anachronistic or just plain odd. Overall, 'From Hell' doesn't really add up to more than series of pictures, some are individually horrific but there's no wider sense of terror beyond the individual moments of gore. Perhaps it should have stayed as a comic book (as such, it would have at least the elegance of economy); but no-one can deny that the translation is beautifully done.",6,1,2,29 June 2005
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," This could be Bosnia, or anywhere
","Films about the Irish war of independence, and subsequent civil war, are not exactly rare, and there's a scene in 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' in which a group of irregular troops ambush an armoured car which made me want to groan, because it seems a perfect clone of an identical scene in every other movie with the same subject matter. Yet this does not mean that Ken Loach's film is entirely superfluous. Many films show how war dehumanises man, but what Loach catches brilliantly is how war can lead to people doing inhuman things while retaining a measure of their humanity, thus explaining how a peaceful community can slide into internal conflict of the most appalling kind. As such, this could almost have been a film about Bosnia, or any other place where savagery has erupted with unexpected force. As for the specific Irish politics, Loach keeps things fairly even handed, he genuinely wants you to understand how people could take both sides, although the ending stops short of explaining how de Valera's quasi-fascist theocracy emerged out of socialist rebellion. To me, this is Loach's best film for many years, because even though it explores a familiar subject, he manages to place the viewer in a less comfortable position than many of his recent works; it's never easy for us to see where our sympathies should lie. Yet it's all done with his well-established gift of empathy for ordinary people with difficult lives.",9,3,6,22 November 2008
Total Recall," Total Rubbish
","How Arnold Schwarzenegger rose to become one of Hollywood's best paid stars is even more of mystery than his subsequent ascent up the political ladder. On the basis of his performance in 'Total Recall', he can't act, his mastery of the English language is limited, he's not even conventionally handsome and, most bizarrely for a star of action films, he runs like a man with a war wound.  Paul Verhoeven's film is a comedy thriller made in the late 1980s but set in a future that looks like... well, actually it looks remarkably like the 1980s, with plenty of concrete, advertising, big hair and a portable computer the size of a suitcase.  Given the film's massive budget, the failure to convey any sense of the vast otherness of space is a particular disappointment.  '2001: A Space Odyssey' did better in this respect over 20 years earlier; the feel of 'Total Recall's vision is more akin to that of 'Star Trek'.The holey plot is based on some interesting ideas that have since been re-used in films like (obviously) 'The Matrix' but also David Fincher's 'The Game': what is reality, and how can we tell? but both those films were far better executed than this.  Meanwhile, the (intentional) 'comedy' is provided by a prostitute with three breasts, Arnie swearing (something which happens a lot) and by an endless sequence of comic-book fight scenes that are neither convincing, exciting or funny (unless one happens to regard Sharon Stone kicking Arnie in the balls as inherently hilarious: one really needs to do so to enjoy this film, as this also happens on numerous occasions).  The unintentional comedy derives from Arnie's performance.If anyone ever re-makes this film, I advise them to save money by hiring a block of wood instead of Schwarzenegger: they'll probably get a better performance out of it. Instead, they should hire instead a decent scriptwriter and a director/designer with some imagination.  In it's current incarnation, it's really not good, and as an actor, Arnie makes a damn fine politician.",3,23,49,3 June 2004
The Red Violin," Ambitious but insufficiently concerted
","Francois Girard's film 'The Red Violin' is nothing if not ambitious: an attempt to make a movie whose star is a musical instrument. Lavishly produced, it shows us a series of stories about the various individuals who own a special violin over the course of several hundred years. Unfortunately, the stories don't really come together to make a resonant whole; and the finale, centred on Samuel L. Jackson's character, is of little interest: there's no underlying reason why we should care about this individual's relationship to the famous fiddle. This is not an awful film; but it lacks the edge of magic needed to make the concept work.",6,1,4,21 August 2006
Sicario," A B-movie in A-movie dress
","Featuring tough-as-nails C.I.A. agents freelancing in the drugs trade, 'Sicaro' follows a fairly well-worn path. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it's first half, with its disorienting but realistic feel. Further on, however, the plot goes downhill, starting with a hook-up that goes implausibly wrong, and ending with a deeply unconvincing conclusion. In between, the movie swaps protagonists, and abandons Emily Blunt's heroine to show the vigilante-style antics of another character, even though until this point the central mystery of the film was that she (but also us, the viewers) didn't know what to make of him. The film's final scene affects to show real concern for those who live in northern Mexico under the rule of the drugs barons; unfortunately, there's a B-movie not too far behind this superficially serious portrait of their reign.",6,1,2,21 March 2020
Inside Man," Absorbing but unsatisfying
","Spike Lee's 'Inside Man', a film about hostage-taking bank robbers in New York, at one point name-checks 'Dog Day Afternoon', another film with a similar subject matter. But whereas that film, as with Lee's own early work, was an authentic portrait of the hard lives of ordinary Americans, 'Inside Man' is high-grade tosh. Lee can do this sort of thing, he even does it quite well, but there's a fundamental shallowness here: the motiveless criminal, the super-cool, super-connected Miss Fixit, the evil banker who once did a deal with the Nazis (and I'm no friend of the Nazis, but the use of 'Nazi' as a convenient shorthand for an evil which cannot be questioned and which is by definition completely different to the evil of any other customer who any other banker might conceivably have dealt with is typical of the laziness of the film's grander concepts, however well worked out the details). Moreover, the essential trick of the movie is intrinsically undramatic, and the film's structure is highly constrained as Lee attempts to extract some impact from the idea. Overall, it's absorbing but not quite satisfying; with little substance below the surface.",7,1,2,30 June 2011
Pulp Fiction," Cooler than the Fonz
","If you only know the work of Quentin Tarantino from the self-indulgent 'Kill Bill' films, you'd be surprised to see the sheer brilliance of his earlier efforts: the Shakespearian 'Reservoir Dogs', the underrated blaxploitation thriller 'Jackie Brown', and this film, made in between those other two and perhaps his finest work. Inventive, clever, funny and cool, 'Pulp Fiction' was one of the defining films of its decade, and over ten years later, it still feels fresh. Samul L. Jackson will forever be remembered as bible-quoting hit-man Jules; John Travolta revived his career as his sidekick Vicent, who always seems to be on the toilet at the key moments; and if this sounds like a crass sort of gag, in fact it is executed with the stylish slyness that characterises the whole film. The dialogue is often hilarious too, while the achronological story telling is perfectly judged, turning a collection of essentially separate tales into a single movie. It's not quite perfect; the scene in the basement has its moments, but also hints at the tendency to unadulterated excess that has come to typify the director's later work. Watch this film instead; and hope that one day, Tarantino will manage to make a another one like it.",9,1,2,12 January 2008
Titanic," A sinker
","Superficially, the loss of the Titanic is a strange theme for a movie, since we all know what happened before it even starts.  But 'Apollo 13', despite its faults, showed that a story of this sort (albeit one with a happier ending) can still succeed through a low-key focus on the human condition in a state of adversity.  For 'Titanic', however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet's feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio.  Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a 'man of the world' in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com.  In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.Yet oddly the film is compelling to watch, at least until the iceberg hits, precisely because you know what must come in the end.  But when the boat starts to sink, so does the film.  When the natural drama of the situation begins to climax, Cameron focuses instead on the ludicrous personal melodrama of his leads, and an extended action sequence that makes 'Star Wars' seem believable by comparison.  The final sinking, by contrast, is actually quite moving, though needless to say, presented with a minimum of economy.Overall, 'Titanic' is a contradictory film.  Its massive budget shows in the beautiful attention to visual detail (particularly in the mighty portrayal of the engine room), and the bombastic force with which the director combines the private and the public sides of an unquestionably massive movie.  But it also shows in the good-versus-evil plotting, the way that every scene is milked for more than it's worth, the need to tie everything up with a semi-satisfying moral knot, and the general violation of the principle of Occam's razor (i.e. 'it is vain to do with many what can be done with fewer').  Both an awesome spectacle and a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood, 'Titanic' is a true film of its era.  But watch 'Das Boot' instead for a real maratime epic.",5,1,4,18 August 2003
The Shape of Water," Comic book fable
","Giulleromo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' is a beautiful visual enterprise, set in a surreally exaggerated, but immaculately imagined and rendered alternative version of 1950s America. It's also a poetic love story. But behind the beautiful cosmetic detail, there's no real story beyond a straightforward account of good versus evil and love versus hate; there's simply no way to identify with the characters, attractive or repulsive, in the way one relates to normal, flawed human beings. There are rare movies (I can think of 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Delicatessen') which tell a profound human story within a stylised fantasy universe. Without that, what we're left with feels very much like a comic book: it may be beautifully drawn, but there's no depth to what's portrayed.",6,4,7,8 November 2019
The Godfather: Part III," Overlong and unnecessary
","One thing everyone knows about each of the three 'Godfather' films (even if they haven't seen them): that the first is the classiest piece of soap opera ever made, that the second is the most successful sequel ever made, and that the third is spoilt by the poor performance of Sofia Coppola, the director's daughter (who, of course, subsequently gave up acting altogether for a career as a director herself). For once, all of these pieces of conventional wisdom are true; moreover, all (and not just the last) are pertinent when answering the question, why isn't the third film (made after a long interval) as good as the other two? Because the complete answer isn't just Sofia's fault: it's fair to say that, after two epic movies, the whole idea has started to run out of gas, and the plot (based on the short reign of Pope John Paul I, and the death of Roberto Calvi), which appears tangential at best to the overall story of the American mafia, is itself one indicator of this. In effect, the central story has been told already, and it feels as if Coppola is cranking out one more episode of a soap, and no longer in a good way.The movie isn't all bad, but it loses further points for its bizarre ending, a lengthy sequence set during a night at the opera during which almost every character appears to be killed, including many whose particular role in the plot is not at all clear to the audience. Indeed, at times, the symbolism almost appears comically obvious - opera singer picks up a knife, man in the audience gets stabbed, opera singer picks up a rifle, man in the audience gets shot, etc. - and it's impossible to argue that less grandiosity, and more editing, would have benefited the whole finale. Ultimately, there's a reason why sequels aren't usually very good (if a story is told well, it is told and then it is done); and while Coppola managed to defy this rule in making 'The Godfather Part II', sixteen years later he came decidedly down to earth.",Null,1,4,21 July 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," The emperor's old clothes
","'The Matrix' was the surprise hit of 1999, blowing away the much hyped 'Star Wars: the Phantom Menace' by using similarly elaborate special effects, but with much fresher purpose. The acclaim that the film's extraordinary visuals generated, however, appeared to blind many to the movie's inherent unoriginality. The grungy-cool aesthetic and cod-philosophy, for example, are de rigeur in the sci-fi genre: while the 'you can be anything you want to' message and the endless violence were pure Hollywood. The theme of computers turning on their masters dates back to at least '2001', while even the idea of a film where life is a video game seems less than striking when in real life, video games are turned into films! But when two sequels came out, there was a fierce negative reaction. In the absence of a similar visual advance over the first film to that which the first film had been over all preceding movies, the flaws were revealed to all, and both movies were badly slated. In truth, while the original was hardly as ground-breaking as its fans would have you believe, 'The Matrix Reloaded' (film two in the cycle) is not nearly as bad as its critics would make out. It's a highly polished piece of hokum, just as the fist film was, and generally, very entertaining except in the interminable fight scenes (which are spectacular, but sadly as engrossing as watching someone else on a Playstation). The second film in a series of three is always going to be the hardest to make work as a stand-alone entity (which perhaps explains why film three was released so quickly after it); but I think the Wachowski brothers have made a pretty decent fist of it. This is still a stylish movie, and an enjoyable one as well, as long as the original didn't fool you into expecting anything too profound.",7,0,1,5 May 2006
The Disaster Artist," How not to make a movie
","'The Room' is a movie famous for being so bad it's good; and 'The Disaster Artist' is a fictional telling of how it was made. In places it's hilarious, and there are obvious echoes of 'Ed Wood' (and its eponymous lead character), or of the documentary film 'American Movie'. Those two films were both stories of everyday losers, living on the edge and clinging to a dream, in spite of their lack of any evident talent. 'The Disaster Artist' is slightly different, and less interesting, because 'The Room' was made not by a deluded auteur willing to starve for his art, but by a (mysteriously) wealthy man whose decision to blow six million dollars appears to have been made essentially on a whim. While he clearly has his own delusions, there's also a sense of life-as-play which is absent in those other stories; and the decision to end the film on a best-friends-forever-live happily-ever theme seems to fit less will than a suicide would have done, even if (happily) this is how things turned out in real life. Which is not to say 'The Disaster Artist' isn't funny; but is a peculiar tale, one of those stories you couldn't make up.",8,2,2,13 April 2018
The Departed," Reheated affairs
","Martin Scorcese has directed some fine movies, but his remake of 'Cape Fear' was amongst his weakest, a near-identical (and thus pointless) remake of the original. So news of 'The Departed', his version of 'Infernal Affairs', made me apprehensive. For those who don't know them, 'Infernal Affairs' and its two sequels, were brilliant films: violent yet cool, stylish but in no way shallow, and for a westerner like myself, interesting for their take on the Hong Kong underworld (a refreshing contrast to the over-familiar world of American gangsters). To be fair, in this case Scorcese has borrowed the plot elements but made his own film, a long way from a straight copy. Unfortuantly, he has also lost most of what was great about the originals. In the place of the cool, interesting world of Hong Kong, we have a very loud and direct movie full of wisecracking, foul-mouthed, ultra-macho American hard-men. Some of the writing made me squirm, it's not that the lines themselves are especially bad, but there's a depressing lack of originality in the way the script is constructed. Secondly, in the original movie, I cared for both leads, but in this film both Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio's characters (it's a starry cast all round, with a face you recognise in every role) are equally unappealing. And whereas the original movie dared start with the setup complete, leaving questions about how the plot got to this situation unanswered (at least until the sequel), Scorcese lacks the courage to do the same, walking us through the complete story in broadly chronological order, then adding some random, pointless minor time-shifting (the occasional scene shown out of sequence) as if in homage to his predecessor, while failing to understand the rationale of the device. The sad thing is that some of Scorcese's early movies, such as 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver', were as fresh and unexpected as 'Infernal Affairs' was; but in 'The Departed', he has reduced a classic to the Hollywood model of what a gangster film should be, and somehow won as Oscar for the achievement.",6,1,2,21 March 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Timeless horror
","Roman Polanski arrived in America with 'Rosemary's Baby', a classic horror (about a woman who fears that a satanic cabal want to steal her as yet unborn child) that relies on no special effects but entirely on the mood of paranoia and suspense it manages to create. The idea of pregnancy as a time of special helplessness is skillfully exploited; the brilliance of the piece is that it avoids commitment as to whether anything supernatural is actually happening. In places, the 1960s-ness of it all makes it a bit hard to watch, but one really only notices this in the scenes that are filler; when the tension rises, the feeling is timeless. Mia Farrow does well as the eponymous ingénue, and while some of the other actors are more wooden (another fine director, John Cassavettes, plays her husband, yet his acting feels as if it belongs from the 50s not the 60s), but it doesn't really matter, so masterfully does Polanski turn the screw. It's an irony that Polanski's wife subsequently died at the hands of a cult; Polanski himself returned, much less convincingly, to Satanic themes with his lame movie of 'The Ninth Gate'.",8,0,0,26 August 2009
When Harry Met Sally...," Sex in the city
","Irritating, cynical, emotional Harry (played by Billy Crystal) and irritating, ditzy, repressed Sally (Meg Ryan) have a long term non-sexual relationship before finally living happily ever after. There might seem to be a lot to dislike about Rob Reiner's comedy before you start watching it, but a sparkling script by Nora Ephron ensures that in practice, you have to forgive it it's generic rom-com structure and give yourself up to the laughs. At the time when 'When Harry Met Sally' came out (and in fact, ever since), there was a lot of media comment about one of Harry's propositions, namely that men and women cannot enjoy platonic friendship. But the film doesn't answer its own question, and even where the movie is insightful, this insight seems very restricted to the peculiar world of New York's professional dating classes. Perhaps we should blame this film for 'Sex and the City'. But while it may not be deep, the simple fact is, it's funny, and almost impossible not to enjoy.",8,3,4,24 October 2005
12 Years a Slave," Disappointingly conventional
","Steve McQueen's 'Twelve Years a Slave' is not exactly a bad film; but I confess to a certain disappointment in it. McQueen's earlier movies, 'Shame' and especially 'Hunger', were raw, visceral portrayals of life under a certain sort of inescapably grim reality. But 'Twelve Years a Slave', while it contains many horrific moments, is basically full Hollywood, with emotional background music underscoring the emotions we're meant to feel, and a narrative that stresses the possibility of the individual triumphing against evil and misfortune through strength of character alone. Of course, this is a common solution, because depicting unameliorated misery could make for a grim movie: the audience prefers 'The Shaswhank Redemption' to a story ending in prison suicide, or 'Schindler's List' to a drama actually set in the camps. But McQueen has previously skirted the thin line between truth and unwatchability with considerable skill: this outing, though made with a much bigger budget, is a less ambitious effort.",7,2,3,8 July 2016
Wedding Crashers," Deceptively unoriginal
","The originality of 'Wedding Crashers' is conveyed by its title: a pair of young men gatecrash weddings (always full of strangers, so two more can easily pass unnoticed) in order to seduce women. But behind this premise, there's a plot that is a conventional replicate of a thousand other romantic comedies: everyone is beautiful, the class divide falls between the wealthy and the super-rich, sex is great but love is better, homosexuality is innately funny, the hero falls for the prettiest girl (in this case, the lovely Rachel McAdams) who rejects him in favour of her own wretched boyfriend owing to a misunderstanding but forgives him when he proves how much he loves her... a story both utterly unoriginal, and utterly unreal as well. So how much you like this film will probably depend mainly on how much you like its odd couple pairing of Vince Vaughn and Owne Wilson, both cast very much to type. Personally, I found the vision of unreconstructed maleness they projected a bit tiresome, not because of the characters in themselves, but because of the way they represent some kind of approved vision of how men are meant to be. There isn't any real insight into the innate nature of either sex here, to be frank; there are some laughs, but there are also times when you long for the film to go somewhere other than where you expect; and if that's how you feel, you'll still be longing when the credits roll by.",7,1,2,21 March 2008
There Will Be Blood," Theatrical but nonetheless impressive
","Paul Thomas Anderson is a masterful film-maker, and 'There Will be Blood' is a gripping movie, with a superb, always surprising score. The tale of a Californian oilman (apparently with groundings in a real life story), it makes history compelling; and compelling is certainly a good word to describe Daniel Day Lewis's performance as a charismatic, charming but fundamentally ruthless figure, whose need to win ultimately drives away all those close to him (and that's the best fate that any of them get). The film isn't perfect: the dialogue never feels natural, and Lewis's acting is stage-y, though in a mostly good way: powerful and intimate, but not completely emotionally engaging; and the story of his final descent seems a little decoupled from the bulk of the movie. This doesn't mean that two hours don't pass very quickly when watching this film.",9,2,3,22 March 2013
Ice Age," Left me cold
","'Toy Story' is widely acclaimed for being the first film to rely entirely on computer animation; but in fact, it also had qualities that make it quite special among animated films. The ploy about obsolesce - a thinly disguised metaphor for human death - was amazingly dark for a 'childrens'' film. The humour - centred on a toy spaceman who thinks he's a real spaceman - was incredibly sophisticated. And the metaphysic was entirely consistent throughout: every action the toys undertook was entirely in character, which meant that an adult could stay engaged throughout it's feature length. Many computer-animated movies since then have received similar rave reviews, but they haven't possessed these special qualities - and 'Ice Age' has none of them, just a bunch of annoying comedy animals and a by-numbers, episodic plot. There are other features of this film that also seem strange: the absence of any significant female characters, for example, and the unhappy contrast between the nicely rendered central characters and the static backdrops - it's like watching an old film where (human) actors pose in front of painted cardboard. It's also very strange to make the hero a hyperactive sloth with no slothful characterises at all. The best animated films have the same qualities as the best non-animated films, but I didn't find them in this film. And if you really want to watch a film where dinosaurs and humans roam the earth simultaneously, 'One Million Years B.C.' was actually more fun",3,1,3,25 March 2006
Downfall," Portrait of the tyrant as an old man
","Paul Auster once wrote a book, 'The Country of Last Things', about a society where nothing new is ever created, and the people subsist on only an-ever reducing collection of recycled goods. This parable of life without hope has been interpreted by many as an allusion to the concentration camps, but it also serves ably as a stylistic description of Berlin in the last days of the war, as depicted in Oliver Hirschbiegel's superb film 'Downfall'. At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler, someone who had stripped himself of decency and who here is robbed by defeat first of his charisma, and then of his power, leaving only a vapour of malice and madness clinging to the shell of a man. There are also some interesting portraits of other members of the Nazi inner circle: Speer, dignified but unashamed; Himmler, rational and charmless; and the inhumanly zealous family Goebbels. We also see the life of Hitler's secretaries, who had chosen not to see the truth until it was too late but to do otherwise; one of them (in real life) gives an interview that tops and tails the film. Perhaps the most sympathetic portrayal is that of Eva Braun; her sang-froid, and love of Hitler, are utterly mad but retain some connection with what might be considered admirable qualities in another context.I recently watched Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', the best film I have seen about the holocaust, and there is of course a kind of black karma in the way that the Nazi's own fate in ruined Berlin mirrors that of the Jewish heroes of that film, struggling to survive in ruined Warsaw. But the differences are also telling, not just in the way that the Nazis brought their end on themselves, but also in the way that their behaviour, right until the death, has become so utterly divorced from any normal human responses; whereas Polanski's pianist is virtually reduced to his animal essence, the Nazis' twisted idealism seems positively unnatural, yet still believable. Horror films where dozens die at the hands of madmen in confined spaces are ten-a-penny (Hirschbiegel himself has made one, 'The Experiment'); yet this story really happened, and was but a sly coda to the overall war. The awfulness of Hitler's life and actions is perhaps too great for us to truly contemplate; yet in this harrowing picture of his final pathos, Hirshbielgel has made a compelling movie about what happens to humans who forget that they are men.",10,3,6,4 March 2006
The Wolf of Wall Street," Boring fellas
","To many, 'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorcese's finest film. It's certainly well-constructed and entertaining, but it's arguably less nuanced and elusive than his earlier works. It's also better than anything he's made since. I liked 'Casino', but it was essentially the same movie in different clothes. And although he has made different (although generally inferior) movies since then, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the same movie for a third time. But it's not a patch on it's two predecessors.For one thing, at least Robert De Nero could act. Leonardo DiCaprio, who has replaced De Nero as Scorcese's go-to lead actor, cannot, and chews the scenery throughout most of this film. Secondly, like most people, you've probably wondered how the financial services industry manages to capture such a large proportion of our national outputs for itself. This film won't tell you. At least, it hints at some of the causes - pumping and dumping penny stocks, breaking the law and the use of a sales force highly motivated by greed. Yet there isn't a real explanation of how Jordan Belfort made his fortune from nowhere, nor indeed for the general significance of the role that Wall Street plays in all our lives. At times, DiCaprio starts to explain things directly to camera, but he rarely completes his expositions, brushing it off as boring details. Thirdly, as played by DiCaprio, Belfort comes across as a uniquely unlikable (and unrepentant) man. Fourthly, the whole rags-to-riches-to-rags again tale seems at times dangerously close to suggesting that a big house, a fast car, a blonde wife and a steady supply of hookers and drugs really are the keys to happiness - the only tragedy is that the life had to end. Finally, everything in the film seems over-the-top: not just DiCaprio's acting, but the language, the drug-taking, the nudity, even the dumb-ass special effects when the characters get stuck in a storm while at sea. This is not a movie that makes its points subtly. It's loud and long; and not a patch on the quixotic 'King of Comedy', the elegiac 'Raging Bull', the dark and fantastical 'Taxi Driver', and the other works that made Scorcese's reputation back when he still knew how to direct a film.",5,2,2,10 September 2016
The Last King of Scotland," A good book spoiled
","Maybe it's a mistake to see an adaptation of a book if you've already read the novel. Giles Fodden's 'The Last King of Scotland' was so very good - and I liked it for its three insights: into the real, tragic history of Uganda; into the man-child madman who was Idi Amin; and into the (imaginary) mindset of a Scottish doctor whose entanglement with Amin is the basis of the story. Unfortuantly, Kevin MacDonald's film, while superficially broadly true to the book, loses all of its main qualities. The plot is simplified, partly (I guess) for length, but also, I fear, to provide more of what I might call 'Hollywood moments'. Nowhere in the book does Amin personally attempt to murder the doctor in public, for example; indeed, I came to dread hearing the film's score, because whenever music started in the background, it was normally to accompany an action sequence that was that little bit more simplistic than anything in the novel. And it's not as if there wasn't plenty of action in the book to start with; just that it was all more nuanced, and in my opinion, the book's merit lay wholly in that nuance. Without it, the story is less convincing, tells us much less about Uganda and although Forest Whittaker tries hard, he can't fully convey the remarkable nature of Amin's personality when the film almost sanitises his madness to make it fit a little more closely to what audiences expect of a movie villain. The film even commits what I consider to be among the cardinal sins of adaptations (but a surprisingly common one); retaining a scene that has been stripped of all context by decisions made elsewhere in the movie. The hijack of an Israeli plane, which is used here to end the story, occurred in the middle of the original and then it made sense; here it makes none, and when the film tells us that the hijack turned international opinion against Amin, it's wholly baffling (in fact, I'm not even sure it's true, but even in the world of the film, it is not a coherent conclusion). Finally, the very end gives the doctor a hope of redemption marred by cliché ('tell the world. they'll believe you. you're a white man') when Fodden's story was deeper, murkier, more ambiguous and so much more interesting. A great disappointment, particularly as the source material is clearly recognisable; but sadly dumbed down at every point that matters.",6,0,3,22 October 2009
"Hail, Caesar!"," Of self-love and heartlessness
","'Hail Caesar' is not the first movie where Joel and Ethan Coen have lovingly curated a pastiche of another world, and then proceeded to make a comedy that isn't really funny because it doesn't have a heart. There really is something wonderful about this over-the-top portrait of 1940s' Hollywood; but its marred by the film's deliberate self-consciousness, from the ridiculous voiceover (as also used in 'The Big Lebowski') downwards. The Coens are often acclaimed, and there's no doubt they have a certain vision; but to my mind, the only film of theirs that worked completely was 'Fargo', where the deadpan comedy of the absurd was matched by a portrait of everyday tenderness. But 'Hail Caesar' feels more like an (admittedly clever) act of self-love.",6,1,1,23 June 2019
American Gangster," Unoriginal but still gripping
","Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' does exactly what it says on the tin: it's the tale of the rise and inevitable fall of a New York crime lord. Based on a true story, it's original part is the fact that its villain was a suave African American who out-manoeuvred the mafia; the film is also the story of the rare honest cop who brought him to justice. There are some very familiar elements here: in spite of the different racial background, one could argue that 'Goodfellas' is one inspiration for this move, while the use of 'Across 110th Street' on the soundtrack is depressingly predictable (even though I like the song!). I also found the start of this movie a little confusing and uninvolving. But Scott is an experienced hand when it comes to mainstream but classy entertainment, and while the film's later part offers relatively few surprises, its unarguably gripping, and makes you want to know more about the real life of its protagonist.",Null,1,2,6 October 2011
The Mission," Ambitious but flawed
","Roland Joffe's stately film, 'The Mission', tells the story of indigenous Americans first embraced, then abandoned, by a Catholic Church more interested in power than in good. But the film has failings: there are multiple lead protagonists (including Robert de Nero whose role seems inadequate for his star billing), denying us a consistent perspective; the pace is slow; and the battle scenes at the end more confused than dramatic. I also found Enrico Morricone's story invasive and partly unnecessary. In addition, the plot can be summarised as bad stuff expected, bad stuff happens: it's a story extraordinarily devoid of twists. The scope is broad, but for such a simple tragedy, a smaller movie might have serviced better.",6,1,2,6 April 2015
Stranger Than Fiction," Bad fiction
","The central idea of 'Stranger than Fiction' is an increasingly fashionable one in movies at the moment: that an individual suddenly becomes aware of their existence as a character in someone else's book. This idea can be milked for straight comedy, or used to ask profound questions about the nature of existence or writing. Unfortunately, 'Stranger than Fiction' has some value as a straight rom-com, but meets all the expectations of the clichés of the genre, and while this is part of the point, the story is insufficiently clever to render this a satisfying conceit. More seriously, the film asks no profound questions about life or literature whatsoever. In one scene, for example, Dustiin Hoffman's professor takes an interest in the case because the narrator has used the expression 'Little did he know...' - 'I've written books on 'Little did he know'', says Hoffman, but there's no discussion of what he might have written about this formulation. And above all else, Emma Thompson's author is meant to to be a brilliant writer, but the excerpts we here from her narration are so uniformly dreadful that the pretence cannot be sustained: if Will Ferrall's character has a justifiable complaint, it is not at being a character in a novel per se, rather being caught in a story so bad. Moreover, nothing about the writing process as depicted convinces. As the film fades into a feel-good ending, I was left feeling cold: there's nothing in this take on the theme that adds anything to previous treatments.",4,0,1,1 April 2007
Jaws," Don't go near the water, children!
","A contemporary viewing of 'Jaws' is quite a nostalgic experience, taking one back to the days when men were men (and fishermen smashed up their radio equipment, just to prove it), the killing of an endangered species was considered a suitable subject for heroic endeavour, and Steven Spielberg could make movies not weighed down by sentimentality or moralising. Although not quite as brutally effective as his earlier 'Duel', 'Jaws' is still a fine, minimalist thriller based on a very simple idea (namely, 'big shark'), notable also for the absence of a single obvious hero (all three human protagonists have flaws). On the downside, John Williams' famous score is a little proscriptive at times, and although the shark is very frightening, the man versus shark fight is realised with only partial success: one never quite believes that all participants are in the same environment. Nonetheless, this is still an entertaining and scary movie, deserving its reputation as a classic of its type.",8,0,1,28 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," You can write this s***...
","So here, at last, it is, the missing piece in the 'Star Wars' jigsaw. And for anyone who's seen the preceding two parts, you'll know what to expect: visual overload, a semi-comprehensible plot, Ewan MacGregor delivering a passable impersonation of the late Alec Guinness, and ponderous dialogue that, as Harrison Ford said of the original movie, you can write but you sure as hell can't say. But that movie was actually quite good; instalment six, on the other hand, is (like its two immediate predecessors) a film made by someone who's forgotten how to make films. So much is wrong, not least the attempt to depict the story of the old Republic as a fight for 'democracy', a term used without any understanding of what it means. While many have deplored the boring intrusion of political themes into the three 'Star Wars' prequels, the real problem with the politics is really that it is so badly done: we get episodic action scenes interspersed with summary information about the underlying power struggle, which seems to leap between states with little rationale and no force of dramatic development. For example, take the start of this movie, which presents us with the scenario of the kidnap of the galactic Chancellor by an alliance of his two leading enemies, but with no attempt to explains the purpose behind this feat, or the means by which it was achieved. The rest of the film continues in a similar vein: the Republic's eventual fall, around which all six movies pivot, unfolds almost risably.A few odd details to finish this review. Firstly, droids make bad villains: General Grevious, in spite of his great name, is the most boring character in the entire cycle. Secondly, Geroge Lucas at least makes some attempts to correct for the failings of his two previous movies, relegating Jar Jar Blinks to a single scene, devoid of dialogue; while the strange continuity error introduced into episode two, when C-3P0 visited somewhere he apparently saw for the first time in episode four, is explained by having his memory wiped (for no good reason except to tidy up the loose end). The real extent to which this film fails, however, is shown in Lucas's absence of courage, when he fails to end the film with its one truly powerful moment, when Annakin Skywalker dons the mask and becomes Darth Vader. Even after almost 30 years, the Vader figure still inspires immediate terror: you might think he would make quite a good bad guy in a film. Which in fact he does (or rather, did) in part one (i.e. episode four); but not in this movie.",4,3,6,3 January 2007
Ray," Dog bites man
","At first glance, so to speak, it might be hard to see where the drama lies in the Ray Charles story. A successful musician makes a lot of records, takes a lot of drugs and sleeps with a lot of women: big deal. But of course, what makes this extraordinary is that Charles was blind. Even so, 'Ray' struggles to make this seem as amazing as it sounds. In part this is because (as the film suggests) that Charles was astonishingly adept at dealing with his blindness, but in part he managed this by becoming quite a hard personality. But it's also a problem with the notion of the biopic itself; we get an even succession of musical triumphs, linked together by much expository dialogue, before a conclusion centring on his attempts to kick his heroin addiction. And although Charles' talent was to master many styles, the story of each innovation is pretty much identical to its predecessor. The film is saved by some fine acting; but maybe it didn't need to be quite so long.",7,0,2,10 June 2007
Inception," So much less intelligent than it seems
","Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess.",4,17,31,15 January 2011
Lord of War," Thank you for fighting
","Andrew Niccol's film 'Lord of War' is in places amusing, and its heart is in the right place, but fundamentally it's a somewhat pointless satire about the arms trade. Not dissimilarly to 'Thank You For Smoking', it suggests that in a bad world, everybody's compromised but some worse than others; however, it's the worst guys who have more fun. The problem is that this message is both everything and nothing; holding people to account for general badness (but partially forgiving them because of the state of the world) lacks the impact of a specific charge. The use of the song 'Alleluia' on the soundtrack, surely the most over-used music in contemporary film, typifies the blandness of the film's vision. But the corrupt world of gun-running is portrayed here cartoonishly, so we don't really care when people get massacred, and the flimsy treatment can't really bear the belated attempt to add moral weight.",5,1,2,17 April 2010
WALL·E," A glimpse of the future
","I quite like some of Pixar's films, but I tend to feel that they're somewhat overpraised, and there's certainly a theme linking their protagonists, who have variously been cute talking toys, cute talking insects, cute talking monsters, cute talking fish, and cute talking cars. Prior to watching I didn't have that much anticipation for 'WALL-E', about a (presumably cute talking) robot - but how wrong I was. The robot doesn't talk for a start, and the film has the most extraordinary animation I have seen, notably for its inventiveness, attention to detail and sheer beauty. Indeed, many of the scenes have a balletic grace, with obvious nods to 2001 but also (especially in the first half of the film, where there's barely a word of dialogue), to the silent movie era (was I the only one reminded of Chaplin's skating scene in 'Modern Times' by some of the choreography?) Throw in a truly eerie and disturbing portrait of a post-habitable earth in which even (almost all) the robots have died out, and an opposing dystopia of a space ark where humanity survives in total comfort and zero dignity, and you have many of the elements in place of a classic film. Perhaps inevitably, the second half (while still good) is more like a traditional Pixar movie, the story of the triumph of the underdog and the audacity of hope; yet the overall tone of the movie is such, that when the ending threatens to be very sad, you have no idea whether there will be a final happy twist or it will leave you in tears. Until now, even when I've liked good animations, I've scoffed at those who argue they rival the best 'real' films - but 'WALL-E' is a genuine artistic achievement, and wholly deserving of its praise.",9,1,2,20 June 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Not quite great, but still compelling
","Let me start by praising 'The Shawshank Redemption' as is it's due. This is a gripping, manipulative, emotional prison drama with a tricksy plot based on a Stephen King story: as often with King, it's implausible, but director Frank Darabont handles its development so well that it seems believable as you watch it. Praise given, I now need to make clear that I do not consider this one of the best movies of all time, in spite of the ecstatic opinions of IMDb users (and others). First of all, the film paints a somewhat romantic picture of prison life. This may seem an odd thing to say (the life of the convicts is terrible), but the characters divide neatly into good guys and bad ones, the good ones share a sense of community but what's lacking is the idea that the victims of the prison world were the violators of the free one; all the murderers seem far too cuddly to convince. The only possible exception is the lead character, whose almost inhuman resolve makes it seem highly possible that (in spite of his protests to the contrary) he is justly imprisoned; when this ambiguity is resolved half-way through, the film loses something, and he becomes more myth than man. The real problem with the main twist (and the uplifting message it imparts) is not its improbability, but that it softens the world-view of the movie too much. The other main problem is that the film is too long: a braver director might have cut it dead at the crux, but Darabont insists of tying up every loose end, and wringing out every last drop of emotion in the process. It's still a very smart piece of entertainment; but its claims to greatness lie mainly in being exactly what its audience want to watch, rather than in supreme artistic merit.",8,2,3,2 May 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," American angst
","Gonzales' Iñárritu's 'Birdman' tells the story of a once famous movie star trying to rebuild his career, and his sense of self-worth, as a theatre actor. Cue some comedy and a lot of very American angst, as the hero (and his fellow-protagognists) reveal themselves to be simulatenously needy and priveleged. My problem was that I didn't really know what I was supposed to be feeling - I certainy couldn't imagine spending any time with any of these people (or at least, I couldn't imagine enjoying it). Sometimes life is comic, sometimes life is tragic, sometimes you just have to not be so melodramatic about it, a point these protagonists don't seem to have learned. The percussive score and use of unusual camera angles both add to the intentionally unsettled mood.",6,0,1,3 February 2018
The Big Short," No-one expects the global recession.
","Monty Python famously said 'no-one expects the Spanish inquistion.' And no-one expects a major recession either, or else they'd take action to avoid it. The global economic crisis that struck in 2008 came from a sudden collapse in the housing market, and from the financial products that the banks had created that were essentially a bet on this not happening. Only a few people had predicted it would all end in tears. And Michael Lewis' book, 'The Big Short', here made into a film by Adam McKay, tells the story of those few. What makes the narrative appealing (regardless of how complete a truth it is) is that the few were misfits and outsiders, people denied entry to the club of deluded money market insiders. But the film, though entertaining, is only partially succesful. The explanation of how and why things happened is superficial, while the viewer is essentially being asked to root for one group of wealthy investment managers over another. Some of them denounce the essentially fraudulent nature of the major players, but their personal goals are primarily to get rich themselves by exploiting their discovery. They're also mostly obnoxious, and I'm not so certain that being smart, and right, is enough to make you a hero. As a film, I prefered 'Margin Call', a sympathetic look at the lions of Wall Street laid low by the crash, to this more hostile treatment, even if they did all belong in jail.",7,0,0,16 December 2018
Prometheus," Tied into the franchise, unecessarily
","In the beginning was 'Alien', a brutally effective thriller about space exploration, killer aliens and treacherous androids. Then there are 'Aliens', a campier but still classy sequel. Then, sadly inevitably, a near-endless series of successively worse follow-ups. But in 'Prometheus', original director Ridley Scott re-takes the helm for a kind of prequel. Scott is good at this sort of thing, and he cleverly leverages the expected thrills in what is nonetheless an original plot. But at times it's confusing, as the story of the killer monsters is coupled with another one about intelligent, and humanoid, life. Or, to put it another way, this movie might work perfectly well on its own without our familiar favourite enemies even making an appearance. It's still a better than average sci-fi tale; but perhaps one that could have stood on its own.",Null,0,1,3 September 2018
Halloween," The film that launched a thousand sequels
","John Carpenter is widely acknowledged as the 1970s master of low budget shockers; 'Halloween', a tale of teenagers attacked by an escaped killer, was arguably his most influential film. I quite like some of his other films from this era, but, watching this one, I was mostly amazed at how bad it was. The acting is poor, and there's none of the atmospheric Gothic atmosphere of the equally influential 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. Most crucially, the murderer is a man who wears a mask, betrays no expression, and kills for no discernible reason, not even his own pleasure: a less interesting, or plausible, bad-guy, is hard to imagine. Eventually there are some tense (though surprisingly un-graphic) scenes towards the end, but even their impact is reduced by repetition, and by the poorly worked-out zombie-theme that is added onto the end of the film. To me, it's odd that this movie was so widely copied; but as few consider its sequels to be improvements, I doubt that I'll be watching them.",4,6,13,3 November 2006
The Queen," The top slice of life
","Some events seem retrospectively less significant than they did at the time: the death of Princess Diana is one of these. So in a sense, there's little real purpose to Stephen Frears' film 'The Queen'. But it is great fun to see a collection of the great and the good, royals and politicians alike, portrayed exactly as we might imagine them to be. For example, a youthful Tony Blair features, exactly as he was before office and war wore him down; and likewise, everyone else is depicted in a way that seems utterly convincing, but never surprising. Watching this is almost like viewing a soap opera, where the pleasure comes from watching everyone perform to type. Helen Mirren is particularly good in the title role, and it's a tribute to her acting skills that she seems completely in character, and makes the role wholly different from her previous portrayal of Elizabeth the first. Overall, it's hardly a groundbreaking work; but Frears has made a career of depicting odd slices of England, and he seems to enjoy looking over the highest strata in the land with his offbeat eye. If you know anything about the events depicted, you'll probably enjoy it as well.",8,0,0,8 May 2007
Shrek," Formulaic, but with nice touches
","For all the plaudits routinely thrown as the new generation of computer-animated movies, there's a remarkably standard template that underpins them all. In the standard plot, a collection of non-human creatures of different dispositions learn tolerance and friendship through partaking in some ultimately uplifting quest, while the humour has a level of self-awareness designed to appeal to adults; and these things certainly true in the case of 'Shrek', a story about an ogre that appears to owe a substantial debt to Raymond Briggs. But the film benefits from some delightful details, and the fact that Eddie Murphy, who voices the 'annoying talking animal' (as he describes himself in the sequel) is actually funny and not just annoying. Overall, it's less dark and subversive than 'Toy Story' or 'Madagascar' , but much more watchable than the dreadful 'Ice Age', and the standard of animation is unquestionably high. It's not my favourite film, even of its genre; but I definitely enjoyed it.",7,0,1,11 February 2007
The Dark Knight Rises," Fascism versus anarchy
","A few thoughts on Christopher Nolan's film 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Firstly, a positive: I'm a sucker for films which play on the audience's sense of vertigo, I thought the window ledge scene was by far the best thing of the three 'Matrix' films put together, and there's also one scene in this film that's genuinely heart-in-mouth. The others are less positive. One, the standard elements of the blockbuster genre appear to have been done to death - 'Watchmen' also featured a plot based on the misappropriation of a source of potential power, while Cat-woman here has a moment that is pure Han Solo. Two, Nolan goes to great length with his use of computer graphics to depict Gotham City, yet still chooses to demonstrate the existence of its population in the form of a single bus-load of schoolchildren. Thirdly, whatever made anyone think that Bat-man, in any form, was a story worth spending nearly three hours telling? Comic books have their place but it's not that of the epic. Fourthly, as in Nolan's first Bat-man film, there's a storyline based on a pseudo-Eastern Jedi-esque world that feels as if it's from a parallel universe to the urban world of Gotham. Finally, the message of the storyline could be summarised as, when faced with a choice between fascism and anarchy, the former is to be preferred every time. I don't think Nolan is a fascist - but that he can make a film so long and yet so simplistic is in some ways indicative of what is wrong with so many mainstream movies. And yet this is by no means the worst film of it's kind. But views that it represents some kind of masterpiece are symptoms of expectations lowered by a sea of inanity elsewhere.",5,2,6,12 January 2013
Tombstone," Amazingly, worse than Costners' movie
","Wyatt Earp, the hero of the famous shootout at the OK Corrall, is a fascinating character, who lived through the wildest days of the west and eventually became a friend to the actors who played him in the early westerns. The shootout itself (and Earp's subsequent trial for murder) can be seen as the story of a impudent but sorely provoked law man who was nearly stitched up by a corrupt establishment, but there's also a more interesting interpretation: that in Tombstone, many men (Earp and his brothers included) fought in defence of their own business interests; and that jobs such as sheriff or deputy (held by the Earps) or prosecuting authority (controlled by their enemies) had nothing to do with any true concept of law. I've recently seen two of the many films made about Earp's life (in fact, two films made within a year of each other in the early 1990s); but sadly, neither is particularly good. Kevin Costner even managed the unlikely feat of making Earp's life seem dull, through a leaden determination to play him as a man of frankly preposterous moral resolution. In George Cosmatos's 'Tombstone', Earp is a little less noble - but the film is clearly the worse of the two. The gist of the plot (which drops much of the interesting truth) is that Earp is a bland would-be businessman lacking even the gumption to fall in love, but when people start shooting at him for no good reason, he responds by riding around Arizona personally delivering justice to the state's leading criminals. If I hadn't known the story beforehand, I doubt it would have made any sense to me. One feature of both films is that they make play of the character of Doc Holliday, one of Earp's sidekicks; I found Dennis Quaid's take (in Costner's film) a more rounded performance than Val Kilmer's in this one (though the implausible script is more to blame than the actor).The film starts with a portrayal of a random murder just to let the audience know that the bad guys are really bad; and unfortunately, that's about as subtle as it gets. I'm sure there is an interesting, ambiguous version of the life of Earp of his comrades to be told; but I certainly didn't find it here.",4,8,16,2 January 2010
Blade Runner," The past in the future
","The Los Angeles of the near future will, apparently, be very similar to the Los Angeles of the recent past. Yes, it's always raining, but otherwise Ridely Scott's 'Blade Runner' is set in a world recognisable from the novels of Raymond Chandler or from Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. The fact that the plot is about androids seems a minor detail, until about two thirds of the way through, when the film becomes darker and stranger. Themes resembling those of 'Logan's Run' start to emerge (the idea of premature mortality), and although the film ends with an action sequence, it's not shot quite like a conventional all-action finale, with more of an emphasis on mood and less on viscerality. The scene is accompanied (as is much of the rest of the film) by a soundtrack that unquestionably belongs in 1982 (when the film was made), but the overall effect is actually quite moving. Still, although more ambitious than Scott's earlier 'Alien'', 'Blade Runner' is also less perfect. Some details feel like oddities, thrown in for effect without making perfect sense, and Harrison Ford (in the lead role) struggles to convey complex emotion (although he is not playing an android, but allegedly a human). But it's certainly a brave and distinctive movie, and not without intelligence either.",7,1,3,9 November 2010
Mr. Holland's Opus," Life is what happens while you're busy making plans
","The make-up department does a splendid job in ageing Richard Dreyfuss in Stepehen Herek's film about an aspiring composer turned music teacher who finds his vocation over thirty years. It's a good performance from Dreyfuss as well, and the movie also benefits from a reliably creepy turn from William Macy as Dreyfusss' boss. In fact, as a portrait of a life set against a changing political, and musical, landscape, showing how (in the words of a song that features in the plot), 'life is what happens while we're busy making plans', it reminded me of the epic BBC drama series, 'Our Friends in the North'. But it lacks the deeper engagement of that series with the specifics of the times it portrays, and at times seems a little trite as a result. Dreyfuss was Oscar-nominated for his role and this is definitely the sort of film that gets considered at these awards: earnest, gently liberal, ultimately upbeat and essentially unthreatening. And you can take that as condemnation or commendation, as you will; but I enjoyed it.",7,3,4,15 May 2006
Monsters University," No satire, and less imagination than one expects from Pixar
","Pixar's computer-powered animations have earned justified plaudits over the years for their gorgeous aesthetics, their imaginative humour, and a perspective on life that is heartwarming in places but also perceptive, and, on occasion, even bleak – for example, the original 'Toy Story' struck me, more than anything else, as a remarkably frank film about mortality. But 'Monsters University' is a one of the more ordinary efforts in their mostly remarkable canon. A sequel of one of the less adult-oriented of their original films, it lacks the freshness of a typical Pixar effort, and the moral of the story is pure Disney. And in this story of university life, a gentle play with the idea of fraternities is preferred to any true satire (you won't hear anyone suggest that universities exist to cement the advantages of rich kids or to provide cushy jobs for their teachers, although the setting is the sort of college that only exists because some people are willing and able to pay big money for it). This is probably the harshest review this children's film will get; but 'WALL-E', perhaps the most ambitious Pixar movie, was an incredibly poignant film about the damage that man is doing to the planet – and that didn't mean that it forewent comedy, action scenes or even the hint of a happy ending either. 'Monsters University' will doubtless be enjoyed by its intended audience; but unusually for Pixar, that's as far as it goes.",5,3,5,13 October 2013
Casino Royale," Bond in the beginning
","Everyone knows what a James Bond movie should be like, with spectacular special effects, evil villains and Bond's suave sexiness. A host of actors have played the role with different emphasis, and the last Bond movie I saw, featuring an invisible car, was fun but very close to parody (the difference between it and the 'Austen Powers' Bond-spoofs was really quite small). In fact, Mike Myers was not the first to spoof Bond: the rights to Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, 'Casino Royale', were separate from his later novels and the story was filmed independently from the rest of the Bond movies to comic effect. Now we get an 'offical' 'Casino Royale', and a new Bond to boot. Daniel Craig is the least suave Bond to date, he seems to have inner demons, and the story has been filmed with Bond cast as an inexperienced young agent: the soundtrack reflects this, denying us the familiar Bond theme until its hero has earned it at the end of the movie. There's also a darker note to the plot (although it's disappointingly softened in the debrief). Unfortunately, the gambling scenes are desperately dull (think 'The Cincinatti Kid' for evidence that they can be done better) and the movie as a whole is neither fish nor fowl: you can't quite take it seriously as a thriller, and there are fewer campy laughs than in the rest of the series. But the public seems to like it, and so this rather ludicrous franchise continues into a new age.",5,6,10,1 May 2007
Toy Story 3," Not quite as fresh as its predecessors, but still funny and moving
","The original 'Toy Story' was not only the world's first fully digitally animated feature, but also funny and original, the story of toys who just wanted to be played with, but who lived with the fear of redundancy and, in the case of Buzz Lightyear, an identity crisis (Buzz believing himself to be a real spaceman, and not just a toy). It played with the dual life every child ascribes to their toys, and brilliantly exploited its novel medium's ability to combine realism and fantasy. The sequel was pretty good as well. 'Toy Story 3' isn't bad either, although the idea is, inevitably, not quite as fresh in its third outing, the basic dynamic of the plot mirroring that of the two earlier films. There are still some fine moments: when Buzz gets stuck in his Spanish mode, the result is truly hilarious, and the scene in the furnace room more affecting than a story about talking toys has any right to be. The ending of the tale implies this is probably the final outing for these characters, and I think that's the right decision. But the series remains comparable in its quality to the best of Pixar's subsequent, much-admired work.",8,1,2,27 December 2014
Trainspotting," Boyle's best
","Irvine Welsh's cult novel 'Trainspotting' is the grim, irreverent and defiant story of Edinburgh's drug-addled counter-culture, told in a fierce Edinburgh patois.  The achievement of Danny Boyle's film is its reinterpretation of what is a decidedly literary accomplishment in a cinematic form while nonetheless staying true to the spirit of the book. Ewan McGregor is excellent is a lead role that grants no glamour to its star, while Robert Carlyle is hilarious as his psychopathic 'friend'. Indeed, the easy way in which the film combines humour and the lowest depths of the junkie life is very impressive, although (perhaps inevitably) the overall tone is slightly less grim (and somewhat more crowd-pleasing) than that of the original.  Incidentally, while the true nature of its enigmatic title, 'Trainspotting', lurks in an excised chapter of the novel, those of a mountain-spotting persuasion will recognise an appearance by Leum Uillam in a minor role.",8,2,3,1 February 2004
La Vie En Rose," A compelling performance
","The recent biopics of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were quite well done, but at times it felt as if you could superimpose them over each other scene for scene. The problem is that each film tried to tell an essentially uplifting story of hard beginnings, super-stardom, setbacks and ultimate triumph, with great songs emerging as an expression of personal struggle. But there's just not that much drama in a tale of a talented rich person nearly (but not quite) screwing up, and emerging better for the experience, so once the initial breakthrough has occurred, the rest of the movies are just illustrated documentary. 'La Vie En Rose', the story of Edith Piaff, is a bit different, even though it also uses the 'song as expression of self' trope. This is because Piaff, while she also came from a poor background and struggled with drugs, ultimately didn't have a happy ending: she died young, prematurely aged. Also, as the film tells it, she was a strong, tempestuous and difficult woman, someone who lived her wealth and fame as if it might be taken from her at any moment, a form of behaviour that was sadly self-fulfilling. Marion Cotillard plays this troubled soul with some brilliance, from street gamine to ailing diva. Piaff's music is at one level unsubtle, and its rarely heard in the modern world. But even if you're more partial to rock-and-roll, hers is the more compelling story.",8,0,1,1 November 2015
Signs," War of the house
","With 'The Sixth Sense', mysteriously-named director M. Night Shyalaman proved himself a master of certain kind of atmospheric tension. He tries to repeat the trick in 'Signs', with partial success. The start of the film is corny but undeniably gripping, and throughout he manages to conjure moments of real tension despite using the barest minimum of special effects. The limitations of this film lie more in its structure. Aliens are invading earth; but the film concentrates entirely on one family who hole up (for no particular reason) in their own house in the country, facing the menace on their own. The film thus has a feel of a ghost story (isolated family terrorised and haunted), and yet, at a time the whole earth is meant to be faced by destruction, the fate of this one family seems trivial when set in its wider context. One can also grow tired of Shyalaman's stock elements - the over-earnest loving families, the beautiful, supernaturally-aware children, the mysterious book that somehow contains at least some of the answers.Shyalaman certainly has a skill at making this sort of movie, but 'The Sixth Sense' also had a plot that was startling and cleverly-enough constructed to disguise its essential ridiculousness. 'Signs' manifestly does not: which is not to say that it won't make your skin creep as you watch it, and more than once.",5,2,3,3 February 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vapid Fantasy
","Anyone who's seen 'Notting Hill' or 'Amelie' will be familiar with the type of film that offers a view of a city dreamed of in a tourist guide, without much resemblance to reality. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' does the same for the Catalan city, with the added proviso that it's not even made by a local, but by Woody Allen. So it's a view that uses Barcelona (and its stereotypes) as a backdrop while concentrating on two very American characters, and completely uninterested in, say, the difference between Catalonia and Spain (which is a fairly essential thing in Barcelona) or indeed any other hint of authenticity. Allen is of course famous for making films about people obsessing over their sex lives, but in this film, where everyone is (without exception) rich, beautiful, talented and essentially unemployed, it's a good job that they do - they certainly don't have any real concerns to engage them. This film was celebrated as a return to form by its veteran director, and it has a certain style, but it has absolutely nothing to say about life as lived by real people in Barcelona, or elsewhere.",5,0,2,23 February 2012
Sweet and Lowdown," Aptly sweet
","'Sweet and Lowdown' is jazz aficionado Woody Allen's fictional biopic of Emmet Ray, legendary depression-era guitarist and loser. In spite of its faux-historical setting, it's still immediately recognisable as a Woody Allen film, with its rambling construction, sly silly humour, and its use of certain trademark locations (Coney Island, for example). In fact, it's amazing how easily Sean Penn, a most distinctive actor, slides into Allen's world; and the film is fresher than many of Allen's recent efforts, in part because Allen himself (who reliable self-caricature before the cameras has grown increasingly stale) hardly features in it. It's hardly groundbreaking, but it is sweet, and funny as well.",7,1,2,9 May 2006
Speed," Thick and fast
","Celebrated thriller 'Speed' actually features three separate 'thrills' in one film; the opening section, set in a lift shaft, is my favourite, and the famous bus-that-musn't slow down scenario occupies only the middle segment. The cast includes Dennis Hopper, playing to type as the psychopathic mastermind behind all the action. It's all idiotically silly, of course, and most of the individual stunts could have been done better (for example, when the bus jumps a whole in the freeway, we don't get a shot of the complete move), but director Jan da Bont keeps the action coming at a furious pace. It's brain-numbing stuff, but nail-biting too.",6,0,0,27 December 2006
Son of Saul," Man and animal
","How can you live with a death sentence hanging over your head, and when any course of positive act is only liken to hasten its execution. Saul, the eponomymous protagonist of Laszlo Nemeth's holocaust movie, responds by trying everything to bury a dead child who may not even be his actual son in accordance with the tradtion of his people, even if that means, as someone accuses him, 'betraying the living for the dead'. It's possible to think of Saul (brilliantly played by Geza Rohrig) as insane; but in a world where no-one has a real grasp on living, perhaps it's not so crazy to use your final moments to fashion a narrative that makes some kind of internal sense. Whereas many films about the holocaust (like 'Schindler's List', for example) tell the story obliquely, 'Son of Saul' is set fully in the horror of the death camps, which are portrayed as a hideous combination of '24' (i.e. with continual action and terror) and Hieronymous Bosch. Instinctively, one feels that (most days, at least) the life (and death) camps cannot have been so chaotically wild, if only to preserve the sanity of the guards; but instinctively also one cannot comprehend the murder of as many as six million. As with many films on this subject, what it really brings home is the fine dividing line between animal and the social construct of man.",9,0,1,26 January 2020
X2: X-Men United," Still just a comic at heart, but an intelligent one.
","The basic idea of the 'X-Men' series of films is a good one: humans seek to exterminate a race of highly evolved mutants, who themselves plot to take over the world. Meanwhile, a second group of mutants attempt to broker a compromise. Although there are obvious villains, the fact that compromise might not be possible, and the understandable motivation of the warring parties, add some interest to the scenario: Ian Mackellan's evil Magneto, for example, is a far more complex character than his Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'. The films are still based on a comic book, which means, in a film, lots of special effects and extended action sequences that can grow tedious; but if anything, this sequel is superior to the original, because there's less need for exposition and the role of Magneto is more ambiguous: as a self-contained story, it works better than the second parts of 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Matrix', or 'Star Wars', to give three examples from other trilogies Ultimatelty, it's all hokum; but mostly entertaining, and far from brain dead.",7,0,0,12 November 2006
Amélie," Feel good!
","'Amelie' is an utterly charming French rom-com, that stands out due to director Jeunet's quirky sense of humour, wonderful visual imagination, and above all his ability (well evidenced in 'Delicatessan') to create an atmosphere within which the whole film breathes.  Audrey Tautou's big child eyes also help.  A real feel-good movie, in the very best of senses.",9,1,3,28 December 2003
The Sixth Sense," Solemn horror
","Horror films are usually garish and camp.  But this must be the most understated entry ever in the genre, with its mood of quiet portentiousness and overwhelming solemnity.  And though the final twist is neat, its also very clearly telegraphed.  What saves The Sixth Sense is some fine acting, from Bruce Willis as the so-concerned psychologist, and Joel Harvey Osment as the child who sees ghosts.  It's very nicely done, but not so original. Other films (Truly Madly Deeply, Kieslowski's No End) have played with similar material; and put some more life into death than we see here.",7,0,1,7 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A force revitalized (or at least, replicated!)
","At last, after the unedining tedium of George Lucas's portentious prequels, J.J. Abrams gives us a new Star Wars film we can like, aided by Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. 'The Force Awakens' is a fast-paced space-romp in the spirit of, and paying considerable homage to, the original movies, brining back many of our favourite characters while also introducing new ones (with a nod to modern political sensitivities). Perhaps its biggest problem is where it goes so far beyond simple homage so in places you could almost believe it was an alternative treatment for the script of 'A New Hope'. Of the new cast, I thought John Boyega seemed the most natural; the old cast do come across as old (but then, it was almost 40 years between the movies). The movies takes a bit of a while to find its rhythmn, and Kylo Ren, the conflicted villain, is interesting but not wholly convincing (although arguably Darth Vader had problems of his own). But it's fun, respectful, contains at least some new stuff and is arguably what the world was waiting to see when Lucas gave us 'The Phantom Menace' instead. Ah, well.",8,3,27,1 January 2019
Casino," The last of an era
","To watch 'Casino' today is to be reminded of a time when Martin Scorcese made good films starring Robert de Niro instead of bad ones featuring Leonardo di Caprio. Casiso is a rollicking, rock and roll ride through the world of Las Vegas, brilliantly set against the sounds and colours of two decades. The effortless way Scorcese pulls this off (he uses a 1930s-style font for captions, and at times the strip appears as if drawn in pastels) is perhaps his last great cinematic achievement. But it's not quite a great film, too long for its length, too similar to his earlier 'Goodfellas', and, for all its horrific violence, just a little too smooth. The audience of 'Raging Bull' was allowed to feel what it was like to be Jake La Motta, at least as Scorcese imagined it. The audience of 'Casino' is merely told, the double-headed voice-over steering us through a story we are shown, but never allowed wholly inside of. Still, the abruptly unsentimental ending reminds us of the ruthless that all great directors must possess; and sadly, it's not a edge Scorcese seems to possess any more.",8,1,2,14 May 2011
Heat," Lukewarm
","Michael Mann's western 'The Last of the Mohicans' frustratingly told a complex story (that of the settlement of America) with a black-and-white vision of good and bad.  In 'Heat', he performs the reverse trick, and in a story of a brutal mass murderer and a policeman, tries to assert the moral that they're really both the same.  It doesn't convince in this convoluted, but essentially shallow film, in which even deNiro and Pacino fail to do much more than fill out familiar outlines; the fault in part lying in the degree of respect that Mann accords both stars. Neither wholly realistic nor truly slick; 'Heat' holds the attention but little more, nothing really sparks except for a ludicrously over-the-top gun battle of which Peckinpah might have been proud.  For a really great movie in a similar genre, watch and compare to 'The French Connection', 25 years older but lean, taut and merciless; 'Heat' adds nothing new except for sentiment and flab.",5,4,9,12 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A long time ago...
","'Star Wars' has been blamed for most of the evils of the last 25 years of cinema, and probably rightly.  But no-one who saw this film on first release aged seven could possibly give it a bad review.  It's a simple tale of good-versus-evil, but there's still so much for even the most cynical and cultured of viewers to enjoy: the rousing music, the 70s haircuts, the skillful use of the Tunisian desert (completely convincing as another world) and of course, the stunningly composed opening scene where the great triangular battleship, impossibly large, passes overhead for what seems like an eternity.  Then you have the characters: Darth Vader, the perfect villain; C-3P0, the camp droid; and the bickering duo of Leia and Han. And the touch of extra class added by Brit veterans Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing.  And, most important in an action adventure, there's the perfectly paced, self-contained plot, notably matched in precisely none of its numerous sequels.It's aged well too.  The special effects, then revolutionary, immediately made every previous science fiction film essentially unwatchable, and still look good today (and the 'enhancements' of the special edition are really quite small). It's not the best movie ever made, but for my generation, 'Star Wars' remains the film of our time.",8,1,2,7 June 2003
Cloud Atlas," Lack of structure leads unnecessarily to banality
","I quite enjoyed aspects of 'Cloud Atlas'; but to be frank, I didn't understand it. After watching, I consulted Wikipedia, which outlines the plot of the book from which the film is derived; and then it kind of made sense. The central ideas here are based on the notion of reincarnation and recurrence; of each story being told in its successor; and (in the book only) an explicit formal structure whereby each tale is split into two halves, so that each higher level is bookended by its predecessor. This lavish movie (with no less than three directors) abandons this device in favour of telling all six stories simultaneously. With the same actors appearing in many of the segments, the result is somewhat incomprehensible, especially as many of the segments have fantasy settings (and when the viewer is uncertain of the constraints on reality, it's especially hard to tell when one such reality ends and another begins). The individual fragments aren't badly done, but it's very hard to get a clear sense of a bigger picture beyond the banal message of 'everything is connected'. I would now be interested to read the book; but the film itself is too messy and undisciplined to wholly accommodate such ambitious material.",6,2,8,13 April 2013
Thirteen Days," Days that Shook the World
","In 1961, an inexperienced President Kennedy backed an illegal (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to depose Castro.  A year later, Castro struck a deal with Krushchev to deploy Russian nuclear weapons in Cuba.  It seems that Krushchev was determined to push the theory of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) to its limits: the theory said that both superpowers had to behave sensibly, as neither would survive a war: Krushchev, however, took an outrageous gamble for strategic advantage, on the assumption that the U.S. would still be unable to survive a war, and so would have to concede anyway.  For Kennedy, it was a tough call: he resolved not to tolerate the missiles, but through his actions had to appear both resolute enough to make it clear to the Russians that it was they had to back down, but also conciliatory, avoiding provocations that could have forced his enemy's hand the wrong way.  This balancing act was rendered all the harder by the presence of more gung-ho (or simply pessimistic) elements within the U.S. government, and the need to prepare for war, in case diplomacy failed. After two tense weeks, the missiles were withdrawn and although Kennedy's golden image has since tarnished, his handling of the crisis is still widely praised.'Thirteen Days' is a dramatic reconstruction of these events.  The story is told entirely from the American side, and takes the standard, patriotic liberal, pro-Kennedy line, so we get a lot of square-shouldered men striving manfully to do their best for their country; and a surprisingly aged Kevin Costner is unsurprisingly annoying in the central role of Kennedy's political adviser (Kennedy was a notorious philanderer, which may be why the drama focuses on another character, who can drearily be shown to love his family without invoking ridicule in the audience).  For all these flaws, it's still a gripping, blow-by-blow account of the military and diplomatic moves that constituted arguably the gravest moments humanity has faced.  The world, and Castro, survive to this day; Kennedy, of course, did not, and whether you believe Oswald or the C.I.A. did for him, opposition to his Cuban policy was undoubtedly (and ironically) a central motive in his assassination.  'Thirteen Days' convinces one how unjust that fate was.",8,1,1,2 September 2004
The Thin Red Line," Pretentious, yes... but also harrowing and unusual
","Terrence Mallick's unconventional war film is at times almost too harrowing to watch - rarely can a film have more accurately depicted war as a mechanism for taking live people and making dead ones.  Mallick's use of music, imagery and voice-overs is hardly subtle, but the overall effect is highly unusual, eschewing conventional narrative to concentrate instead on some very un-Hollywood concerns - the futility of individual valour, and the impossibility of even defining what makes a good man in situations such as these.  Well worth watching for all of us fortunate enough never to have been asked to fight for our countries.",8,2,5,26 September 2003
Jackie Brown," Tarantino grows up
","Quentin Tarantino follow up to the hysterical response generated by his suitably hysterical first two movies was 'Jackie Brown', an altogether more restrained film that garnered a somewhat more restrained set of reviews. Perhaps the relative lack of impact made by this film explains his subsequent return to extremes with 'Kill Bill'. But in some ways this is a shame, as there's a lot to enjoy in 'Jackie Brown', particularly in the universally first rate performances the director manages to get out of his distinguished cast. Robert Forster is wise and weary as a middle-aged bail bondsman, Samuel L. Jackson plays a criminal with all of the menace and none of the charm of his character in 'Pulp Fiction', while Bridget Fonda and a (cast against type) Robert de Niro are entertaining as a pair of useless crack-heads. Best of all is former blaxploitation star Pam Grier in the title role, combining human warmth and coolness under fire with considerable charm. The generic Ellmore Leanard plot is ultimately not quite as clever as it promises to be, and as as ever with Tarantino, both tone and taste are sometimes questionable: the early sequence 'Women Who Love Guns' is very funny, but it's quite unclear whether it's intended as satire or celebration. Nonetheless, once one adds in a typically splendid soundtrack, everything adds up to a movie far above the average crime thriller, and for all the breathtaking invention of his other movies, it's enough to make one wish that Tarantino didn't usually feel the need to try so very hard.",8,78,115,10 January 2005
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Dumbed down
","I liked the first 'Madagascar' film; but the third in the series doesn't match it's predecessor, and for a surprising reason: it doesn't make sense. You might think that this is a strange criticism of a film about a bunch of talking animals, but the skill of the first movie, as with many of the best animations, was in placing comic absurdity within a set of very human parameters. 'Europe's Most Wanted', however, puts the emphasis on high velocity action scenes, and tells a story where the world of its characters is totally unconstrained: anything can happen as long as it makes for a spectacular sequence. As a result, the film seems much closer to movies like 'Ice Age' than to Pixar's frequently outstanding output: one for the kids, but without the depths that have made many recent animated movies (includng its own ancestor) something special. However, the train-spotter in me was pleasantly surprised to see quite how accurately the film portrayed not just the tourist sites of Europe, but even Rome's Termini station.",5,0,1,17 January 2013
Sin City," Everything and nothing
","Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' brings to life Frank Millear's comic-book world: hard-boiled, stylised, sexy, ultra-violent, but utterly morally uninteresting. The film certainly succeeds aesthetically, and also manages to maintain a consistent tone better, say, than the 'Batman' films, where any attempt to assert a dark side inevitably runs up against the silliness of the concept. But it's also fare to say that when the protagonist changes (there are 3 separate stories here), you hardly even notice, so little is there that separates one part from the next. Ultimately, when everything is sin, that's as good as saying nothing is.",Null,0,0,14 August 2011
Gangs of New York," Blood without grit
","Martin Scorcese had wanted to make 'Gangs of New York' for many years; but given his exceptional track record as a director, it's a surprisingly middle-brow epic, albeit one that entertains throughout its great length. Like his best movies, it focuses on the criminal underclass, and contains considerable quantities of violence. But whereas Scorcese's most famous works are modern, naturalistic in feel, feature anti-heroes and debunk the myth of nobility and honour among thieves, 'Gangs of New York' is not only a period drama but also theatrical (in dialogue and construction), has a conventionally hero-centric story and indulges the myths that its predecessors iconclastically rejected. In fact, with a classic Hollywood love story, an interest in class warfare, some psychopathic villains, an apocalyptic backdrop to an intimate climax, and Leonardo diCaprio wandering round unconvincingly like a refugee from the 21st century, the film has even something of the feel of 'Titanic'; whereas the massed battles in hellish cellars and work-houses even bring to mind 'The Lord of the Rings'. The film is deeper than those two movies; the surprising thing is that the differences are so small.One can point to a few oddities as well. Unlike most American films, the settled Americans (the 'natives') are the bad guys (and the Irish immigrants the heroes); yet the lead native is played by (Irishman) Daniel Day Lewis, while (the American) diCaprio is chief among the Irish. And diCaprio's face shows a remarkable ability to recover from a supposedly disfiguring wound. These are minor points. The more substantive criticisms are more objections to the type of film Scorcese has chosen to make, rather than to its skillful execution: in telling the tale of a forgotten part of American history, he has done so symbolically, filming a story both grand and personal, but creating a world which never quite feels as real as that of 'Mean Streets' or 'Taxi Driver'. The result is a film that is fabulous in the word's original sense: a 19th century fable. But I prefer his grittier works.",7,0,0,15 February 2006
Moon," Proper science fiction
","'Moon' is a sci-fi thriller that makes a very obvious acknowledgement of it debt to that definitive movie, '2001': it ponders (among other matters) the nature of artificial intelligence and the infinite loneliness and isolation of a life in space, while serving us with an aesthetic of sterile gleaming white, and digital communications devices that might have represented 1970's vision of the future but which already seem decades out of date. The film also addresses another sci-fi staple (though not one mentioned in Kubrick's work), namely the identity of clones, and actually does so with some skill, using its futuristic setting to explore questions of identity that have emotional impact in their own right, as well as thematic resonance in our own world. For sci-fi, this is a relatively low-budget movie: no explosions, an effective cast of one, and a set that at times looks as if it was made of Lego; yet it's sparse, haunting, and effective, and also less pretentious than its illustrious forebear.",9,3,10,8 March 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," An Indian fairytale
","Danny Boyle's successful film 'Slumgod Millionaire' is a vibrant tale of life at the sharp end of modern India; but it's also essentially a fairytale, with a happy ending and details that don't quite ring true. Most notably, it's based around the quiz show, 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?', but it makes the assumption that the programme's makers don't actually want anyone to win, whereas I suspect that in reality, the occasional big winner is exactly what generates most publicity and subsequently revenue for the show. And while I am certain the life of a 'slumdog' is not in any senses easy, the truth is that millions of Indians live, sadly in poverty, but without constant threat from people trying to kill them. Indeed, to me this felt like an outsider's view of India, and perhaps the films popularity stems from the fact that a global audience can share Boyle's perspective; the novel 'White Tiger' tackled similar themes (and in a similar semi-comic fashion) with more authenticity. Indeed, the dramatic tension of Boyle's film comes more from the quiz show embedded within it than from the thin surrounding plot. It's vivid and entertaining for sure; but aside from 'Trainspotting', I've never been wholly convinced by those who think Boyle a genius; and I wasn't convinced here either.",7,1,2,13 April 2010
The Nice Guys," Nice enough
","'The Nice Guys' is a comic detective/crime romp, set in the 1970s, reminiscent of Elmore Leonard. It's actually quite funny and inventively plotted, though the comedy is fairly broad-brush and it quickly transitions from low-key to wild, concluding in a lengthy fight scence which although played for laughs could have been taken from a superhero movie in terms of its violence and preposterous complexity. Personally, I prefer my films with a touch more realism, but it's diverting enough.",7,1,1,22 June 2020
The Breakfast Club," Saturday is det time!
","Watching this seminal 1980s movie certainly stirs feelings of nostalgia: I'm roughly the same age as the film's central characters, and my school also had Saturday detention (although not quite in the form depicted here). With its archetypal characters, essentially static, dialogue-driven scenes, and internal dance routines, 'The Breakfast Club' is actually quite theatrical; but not without merit. On the downside, there's a dreadful period soundtrack (Simple Minds, anyone?) and some of the incidents are a bit obvious and ploddingly handled. But offsetting this, there are also plenty of genuinely funny and true to life moments. What is a pity the film is somewhat overbalanced by Judd Nelson's character; for sure, he's meant to be an attention seeker, but Nelson just seems too old for the part, more like a man pretending to be a boy than a real angsty teen. In the movie's second half, the character is quieter and the benefits are clear. The film has a crowd-pleasing bias towards the pupils in detention (as opposed to their teacher), and it ends with one of those make-overs beloved of Hollywood teen-movies, where the plain girl becomes beautiful (but only if you have a certain aesthetic preference). However, there's still more to think about about than in the average movie of this genre, not least the idea that the power of one human over another is always (in some sense) applied through consent. And compared to the likes of modern successors like 'American Pie', there's a sweetness here lost in the last 20 years.",6,1,2,18 March 2006
Gladiator," History updated
","According to the brilliant but eccentric historian Gibbon, the succession of the philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius by his mad son Commodus marked the start of the decline of the Roman Empire. It was this event which provided the setting for Anthony Mann's 1960s film, 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', and 'Gladiator' is a modern reworking of the same story, with a hefty nod to Kubrick's 'Spartacus' as well. At first, what catches the attention is what's new in the film: the odd, Enya-esque soundtrack and the impressive, almost convincing but over-used computer generated animation (I mean, how many digitally-enhanced thunderstorms does one film need?). But behind the slickness, what's more noticeable is how firmly this film sits in the tradition of earlier Roman epics. I rather like this genre, as the inherent political and personal drama in these almost true stories is immense; though in 'Gladiator', some of the potential is lost through sentimentality and a tendency to reduce events to an elemental struggle of good and evil. Russell Crowe in particular, all honour and valour, is dull in the central role. But as is usual in films such as this, a clutch of talented British thespians lend some class to the project: in this case, Richard Griffiths, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and of course Oliver Reed, his magnificent eyes still wild with life (though he died before filming was complete). Overall, 'Gladiator' is a welcome addition to a canon that has lain untouched since 'Cleopatra'. What I'd really like to see, though, is a film of the life of Dicoletian, one of Gibbon's few heroes in the long tale of the dark years.",7,0,1,28 September 2004
Donnie Darko," One rabbit of the apocalypse
","'Donnie Darko' has a reputation for being a seriously strange film; but in some ways, it's undeserved. This is not just to say that it is fundamentally very conventional compared with the work of the likes of Bunel; it's actually far coherent than many mainstream science fiction thrillers (for example, 'Open My Eyes', or it's American remake, 'Vanilla Sky', which where simply praised for their 'dazzling' plots); or horror films like the 'Ring' cycle. My guess is that audiences were thrown primarily because of the expectations of genre; supernatural, surreal happenings are simply not supposed to appear in what is partly a teen movie, and partly a suburban satire. As a straight film, 'Donnie Darko' isn't bad: all the sympathetic characters are unnaturally beautiful, of course, and there are the customary easy pops at educational behaviourists (to a Briton, this recurrent aspect of American teen movies is very strange, can they really be so prevalent to deserve this amount of attention?); but there's some nice dark comedy, and the acting and editing are generally of a high standard. It even manages to possess a good soundtrack using 1980s songs (in my opinion, quite an achievement in itself!). As science fiction, on the other hand, it bears some resemblance to Douglas Copeland's book, 'Girlfriend in a Coma' (and indeed, makes much more sense than that book did). What it doesn't give us is any indication of why the events we see should happen to its hero; the film may be sensible, but it's also essentially meaningless. Nonetheless, it's intelligently made, distinctive, and not really that confusing, providing you leave your preconceptions at the cinema door.",7,0,0,7 August 2005
Born on the Fourth of July," Powerful, but simple
","It may be hard to remember in the age where his service in the Vietnam war is a major political asset for John Kerry, but that war was for many years a real embarrassment to America (which fought and lost it).  The veterans of that war were among those to pay the price as mainstream society preferred to forget what it had done in sending them there. The movie industry, meanwhile, eventually established its own orthodoxy: we could hardly expect Hollywood to praise those who refused the draft (or indeed the Viet Cong); but now there are many movies which, without defending the war or the way it was fought, nonetheless celebrate the individual soldiers who took part. This narrative extends to also telling the tale of their subsequent betrayal at home, which is the subject of 'Born on the 4th of July', as well as earlier films like the masterful 'Deer Hunter' and, obliquely, 'Taxi Driver'.Before this film, Oliver Stone had a reputation for making one-dimensional, bombastic movies, and Tom Cruise had one as a pretty boy who couldn't act. But Cruise certainly widens his range, playing a crippled veteran with some passion and skill, and although Stone has not made a subtle film here, it's at least an improvement on the atonal 'Platoon'.  The basic story is naturally compelling, although the beginning is over-stylised (or, to be more cutting, under-individualised) and the 'happy' ending (Cruise's character becomes a Democratic activist) is a bit strange, given Johnson's instrumental role in Vietnam.  Ultimately, the film's critique of the war is put forward with some partisanship, but also too simply to convince: it's purpose is more to explain how the hero changed his mind than to make us change ours.  Overall, it's not a bad film; but I'm still waiting to see a Vietnam movie that really dares make the toughest political points.  It does, however, provide an early hint of Stone's obsession with Richard Nixon, which came out more fully in his later work.",7,0,1,3 August 2004
The Social Network," From bedroom to boardroom
","Steve Jobs didn't invent the graphical user interface. But he did produce the first implementation of one in which enough of the details were right for it to be popular. And Bill Gates (who makes a cameo appearance in this film) did not necessarily produce the world's best computer operating system. But his system became the first standard, and the advantages of using a standard system meant that once Microsoft was big, it was destined to become huge. Both of these factors (technical refinement and network effects) help explain the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. And while it's interesting to observe the fine lines that makes one person a billionaire whereas another goes bankrupt, it also perhaps tells us that the detailed biographies of those who happen to end up on top are maybe not that interesting or important. One might make an exception for Jobs who showed an uncanny knack throughout his career for shaping sector-defining products. But is Zuckerberg, whose social networking software happened to win out over the competition, really worth the attention? This movie, describing the story of Facebook's foundation, is perhaps most interesting because its participants, most of whom are presented badly here, are still alive (and indeed, young): I don't quite know how the script was steered around the lawyers, or how true it is. It's certainly quite fun to watch a tale of almost-schoolboy capitalists, hopelessly out of their depth when their business venture turns out to be worth billions (although this part of the story would probably work as well without the crazy numbers); and when the concept is so nebulous, the business so fluid, it's easy to understand the lawsuits which led to many people claiming that they really owned the company: in some senses, the business made itself. What does grate is the sense of self-assurance, and self-entitlement shown by the class of Harvard, all of whom are depicted as both arrogant and brilliant, when their most obvious merits are merely their own well-connectedness. Again, this may be true to life, but you won't find any socialistic moralising here. Instead, there's a snappy (though glib) script and a surprisingly breathless journey from the bedroom to the boardroom. It's a fun film if you like this sort of thing, but less insightful than it thinks.",7,0,1,26 August 2013
Macbeth," Great atmospherics, but no poetry!
","When staging Shakespeare for the cinema, directors have two obvious choices: one, to go with a straightforward theatrical production, and the other, to use the play as the starting material for a screenplay conceived for the purpose. In this version of 'Macbeth', Justin Kurzel clearly takes the second approach. He certainly gets the atmospherics right, and Michael Fassbinder is exactly the sort of actor you would think would be able to make the title role his own. What is lost, however, is the poetry, speeches are mumbled rather than disclaimed, and you might hardly recognise that this was a play written in verse. To me, the result is simply rather dull, and quite possible, hard to follow if you didn't already know the story (though for some reason, the minor detail relating to the prophesy about Macbeth's killer - that he would not be of 'woman born' - seems to be repeated dozens of times). It's true, writing plays in verse is an outdated convention - but the reason we still watch Shakespeare is because he was so damn good at it, and what's left once that is abandoned is not nearly as interesting. I'd recommend the version with Patrick Stewart from a few years back, no less intense, but much more Shakespearian.",4,1,2,3 September 2017
Goodfellas," Goodfellas, but not quite great
","Martin Scorcese's compelling 'Goodfellas' is arguably his most entertaining film.  It's accomplishments include a strong but believable narrative, a loving recreation of two decades of New York life in music and images (including some famously stunning elongated tracking shots), and great performances, in particular from Joe Peschi as the psychopathic killer Tommy and Paul Sorvino as a mafia boss.  Yet its watchability is also its weakness.  Central character Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) narrates throughout, smoothing together the strands of the story but also telling us how to interpret it and thus distancing us from the action.  The film lacks the visceral intimacy of 'Raging Bull' (or, indeed, the subversiveness of 'Taxi Driver' or 'The King of Comedy'), while, for example, the emotional impact of the scenes where Henry realises the mob is out to kill him is slight compared with, say, the similar scenes concerning Al Pacino's character in 'Donnie Brasco'. It's almost impossible to dislike this film, because we are led through it so adeptly, but at a certain level, it's little more than a well-spun yarn, proof perhaps that a master reaches the height of his technical powers somewhat later than the peak of his imagination.  Enjoy it, but the early stuff is better.",8,0,1,23 June 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Effective but empty
","British drama-documentary specialist Paul Greengrass may have appeared an unlikely choice to direct two installments of the series of films about Jason Bourne, the amnesiac assassin, but his work has been widely praised. And it's easy to see why: his use of hyperactive, fast zooming camera work, frequent cross-cutting and driving music is very effective in ratcheting up the tension; viewers may find themselves physically flinching on more than one occasion. The problem with 'The Bourne Supremacy' is that there is so little content behind the high-energy frontage. In some ways, the tension is fake, because Bourne is more like superman than man, capable of getting out of what would be fatally tight spots for almost anybody else with unfailing skill and dexterity: the fight scenes, for example, are superbly choreographed, but surely bear no resemble to any fight that has actually ever been fought in real life. Likewise, the contemporary relevance of the film's message - the danger of intelligence agencies growing too powerful - is rendered vacuous through its assumption that such an agency would be capable of doing anything - tracking down people instantaneously, for example (or indeed, creating a super spy like Bourne - in fact, anything except recapturing him after losing control). We may be right to fear a world of surveillance, but it's hard to believe it would work with such slick precision. I was also irritated by the pointlessness of Julia Stiles' character, who is repeatedly name-checked in a too-obvious attempt to set her up for a bigger role in the final film. The result is that you may spend two hours of your life on the edge of your seat; but there's nothing to remember afterwards, although geekish fans of European public transport systems may never see another movie in which these feature so prominently.",5,1,3,8 March 2008
Warm Bodies," A pleasant little zombie film
","On the face of it, 'Warm Bodies' is a very interesting film: one part zombie-action movie, one part comedy-romance, and one part whimsical science fiction. In practice, it isn't quite as interesting as it sounds, because each of three elements is actually quite generic, even though they're cleverly interspersed. Overall, the film has a nice mood, although veering heavily towards the sentimental, supported by the kind of folkie soundtrack that seems to be de-rigour in a certain sort of movie (in spite of the genre-bending, think 'Garden State' and you won't be too far out). And if it seems strange to summarise a zombie flick as pleasant viewing, in this case it's correct call.",7,3,5,7 November 2015
Princess Mononoke," Just a drawing...
","I'm not normally a huge fan of fantasy, or of animation; but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'Princess Mononoke'. And not just because it's absolutely beautiful; but more because it has a level of moral ambiguity not normally seen in either of its two genres. The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway. And when, near the end, with their fates hanging in the balance, the hero puts his arm around the heroine, I found it strangely moving in a way that I didn't expect to feel about what is, after all, just a drawing.",9,0,2,5 December 2010
Valkyrie," The story survives some ordinary direction
","The Stauffenberg plot was an attempt to assassinate Hitler, size power in Berlin, and end the war, and in 'Valkyrie' (which was the code name for the second part of the plan), a largely British cast (aided by Tom Cruise) attempt to tell the story. The scheme was well-planned, unlucky, and had it succeeded, many lives might have been saved. But Bryan Singer's movie suffers from some problems. Stauffenberg's heroic qualities are maximised (he's presented as the bravest, and furthest-sighted, member of the conspiracy, as if being the one who actually planted the bomb was not enough); and the complex motivation of German rebels against Hitler is simplified into anachronistic moral revulsion (which is not to say that the plotters didn't indeed think Hitler evil; but their view of the world was almost certainly a different one from the conventional contemporary judgement on the Nazis, which is how their thinking is represented here). There's some unimaginative direction as well: how many shots of a man in uniform throwing a cigarette butt on the ground does one movie need? Yet the natural power of the story is too great to be completely ruined by one director. These men were attempting to take a life, risking their own (with unknowable odds), and attempting to save millions. When the film ends with a quote from the German resistance memorial, it's hard not to be moved.",7,0,0,5 October 2013
All the President's Men," Truth is stranger...
","A central problem for all thrillers is that the need to find twist after clever twist means that stories escalate quickly into realms of implausibility; an apparently boring tale of low level corruption soon brings down the President of the United States. Which gives 'All the President's Men' a huge advantage over most thrillers, because this film (based on the Watergate incident in 1972) can tell such a story and support it on the basis that all of it is true. Director Alan Pakula, something of a conspiracy thriller specialist, here does a great job in adapting the book written by the journalists who broke the story: the film is never overly melodramatic, but is always tense, and although it has pair of heroes, we're left in no doubt of their selfish motivations as they work potential witnesses any way they can in their bid to nail the truth. Unlike most clichéd detective thrillers, the true nature of the crime is unknown (and arguably, remains unknown to this day), so even though we know what happened, there's an air of unpredictability to the story; reporters Woodward (played by Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) don't know what they are looking for, even though they are certain that (somewhere) it is there. The plot is nicely paced, and even dares to skip lightly over the eventual vindication of the journalist's hunches, preferring to concentrate on how it felt for them, chasing this huge story, over a mere historical reconstruction of President Nixon's demise. Indeed, although Nixon appears in this film, it's only on television, and played by himself. This means that what we don't get is a wider analysis: a theory as to the true motive of Nixon's actions is hinted at but nothing more; nor does the film tell us whether it regards his behaviour as a disgrace to modern politics, or an mere symptom of them. In this respect, Oliver Stone's (more fanciful) 'Nixon' makes an interesting companion piece. But as a complex, gripping and understated thriller, 'All the President's Men' has few equals. Truth is stranger than fiction indeed.",9,71,88,10 April 2005
The Martian," Futurism and Nostalgia
","From the earliest days of cinema, films have explored what man can do when cut off from society (and indeed, the interest of the topic pre-dates the art form: think how long ago Robinson Crusoe was written). But in a world ever more monitored, depictions of life beyond borders are often set in space. These include both fictional tales and true stories. 'Apollo 13', for example, is a riveting film, but mainly because of its raw material: in 1971, a manned space mission suffered from an explosion and the astronauts were stranded, thousands of miles from help; amazingly, they managed to fix their stricken craft and make it home alive.'The Martian' is a fictional story, but is in some ways Apollo 13-redux. It starts with a gripping scene where, post-disaster, the hero is forced to operate on himself: gripping, yes, but also not a scene that needs to be set on Mars. And subsequently, it can't quite live up to this compelling start. As I see it, there are three main problems. Firstly, some implausible science (how can you grow plants without carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?) and psychology (the story is set over a period of years, but we never really get the impression that the character is stranded alone for so long). Secondly, the need for the Hollywood virtues where force of character compels eventual triumph. And finally, perhaps, that the remarkable thing about Apollo 13 is not that its crew could have saved themselves, but that they did: the triumph was not one over the laws of physics, but rather a win against the odds. In a fictional story, this is a less compelling narrative structure: why does the character get repeatedly lucky? Simply because the screenwriters wrote it that way.Yet in spite of its faults, the film's basic set up draws you in, and by the (admittedly melodramatic) rescue scenes, one can't help but watch on the edge of one's seat; and keeping an audience interested for over two hours is not such an easy thing to do. Perhaps the fact that in the real world we've basically given up on manned space travel adds to the appeal: this may be a futuristic story, but at the same time, it also feels like a tale of something we used to do, to boldly go beyond the limits of our planet to see what we might find.",7,15,24,4 February 2016
Atonement," A decent rendition of a far from straightforward story
","It's possible to consider 'Atomement' as one of Ian McEwan's most conventional novels; but with it's elusive plot and shifting perspectives, it depends very much on the author's characteristically precise prose to hold it together. Therefore, I had my doubts about a film billed as a 'romantic epic'; and indeed, there are moments when a little less in the way of lush, stirring music might have been a good thing. But for the most part, it captures the tone of the novel well, and through this, succeeds in maintaining its coherence (although the section set in France feels a little adrift). Overall, I feel much the same about it as I did about the book: it's a clever, subtle exploration of feelings and motives, yet it's almost as if it's lacking the climactic scene. I think this is McEwan's point; that in real life, this scene, as often as not, never takes place. I certainly preferred it, in both its forms, to 'Enduring Love', another of McEwan's novels adapted for the screen.",Null,0,0,6 August 2011
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Distinctive and daft
","Whether or not you actually like them, no-one could accuse the Coen brothers' films of not being distinctive. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is a zany, indeed stupid (although still highly enjoyable) comedy about a hair-gel obsessed prison escapee (played by George Clooney), set in a lovingly created bastardisation of the depression-era American South, underpinned by the music of that time (and the music, surprisingly, is treated with some reverence, however farcical the other elements of the movie). To its credit, it's funny, and quite unlike any other film you'll have seen before. To its detriment, as with a lot of other Coen films, it's not especially emotionally engaging, and there's little in the way of coherent plot, just a ramble through the brothers' strange imagination. As for the claim in the opening credits that it's based on Homer's odyssey, there are some nods in this direction, but don't expect anything too literal; just remember that 'Fargo' was 'based on a true story' in the same fashion.",7,1,2,25 September 2007
The Godfather," A tale of personal business
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.",9,2,4,21 January 2007
