Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace--A Great Start to a Whole New Trilogy
","The movie people waited sixteen years for is finally here.  All the anticipation, the hype, waiting in line for hours.  Now the movie we've waited for so long is here and everyone's disappointed.  I can't quite put my finger on the exact reasons why.  I've heard it's because there's no story, no character development, and Jar Jar Binks.  I've read almost every pan and every gripe by every critic.  And all the while I keep thinking. God, I'm thankful I'm not George Lucas.  All you whiners who are disappointed and complaining should keep in mind, that the original Star Wars, which everyone compares Menace to, did not have to stand up under the intense scrutiny this film has.  And believe me, it wouldn't have. Phantom Menace has so much baggage attached to it.  It's the first Star Wars movie in sixteen years, it has to introduce a new trilogy and new characters, lay the groundwork for future storylines, and make the first movie a satisfying entry that can stand with the other three films.  I'm not saying this is the greatest movie ever made (Empire still holds that title), but it's such a quantum leap in imagination and storytelling over so-called blockbusters like Godzilla, Armageddon, ID4, Jurassic Pak, Lost World, etc.  Two hours in a Lucas universe beats two hours spent in any of these movies hands down. I will not describe the plot or any of its details.  Personally, I thought the characters were good, well-drawn and mostly well acted.  Neeson was the best, but Jake Lloyd was also a nice surprise.  The story drops hints about characters and what we can expect they will do in the next two episodes. My friends and I have been talking about this movie endlessly, debating where the events Lucas has set in motion will lead us.  Now, I know some will still not like the movie no matter what.  That's your choice.  But the widespread negativity by critcs and fickle fans has been depressing to me, because we finally have what we wanted and now everybody's mad.  Star Wars is back and George Lucas has been good enough to take us back.  Let's just enjoy it.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
