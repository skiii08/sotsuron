The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I feel infinite
","The movie is about a shy freshman who is obsessed with past things which are unclear in the first..The whole movie, camera is hanging around this guy ,with his voice-over narration..It has succeeded to feel the Charlie (the shy guy played by Logan Lerman) in ourselves..I don't know whether it's because I'm shy,this movie is so emotionally attached to me ever since.. Charlie is shy as told,and think that no-one can understand what is happening with his mind and so is tired of 'how-to-face-real-world' advice..He doesn't want to let others know that he is a desperate introvert sad kid in his school..His extremities are low,what he had knowledge of happy world was less..then he meets Patrick and Sam,they understand his loneliness,make him feel better around them..so that he could know what is extremity like..and he find himself infinite.. This is not a story of mindF***,yet beautiful possible things happen in the innocent love life of Charlie.. The casting is perfect, Logan's face defines the Charlie character..Sam is impossible without Emma..Ezra Miller plays Patrick very well.. Many things happen in this movie,yet movie would never get caught of bad scene transitions.. The movie uses soft soundtrack which matches the character's mind.. Now,what make you watch this film:* emotional attachment to the main character,obsession of an old incidence,becoming shy,afraid of real world.. * experience of innocent love.. * experience of a good romantic drama movie..",8,1,2,25 October 2013
