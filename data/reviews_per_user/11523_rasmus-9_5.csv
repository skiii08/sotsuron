The Blair Witch Project," Very original... (possible spoilers)
","Before I saw this, I heard that this movie was supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever. So when I sat down with the movie, I was expecting a pretty scary movie.I think the movie is very original with the actors running around with the camera themselves and with no music of any kind.If I didn't know this was movie, I would have thought that this was real.In many ways this is truly a very scary movie. It's not shocking like your average Scream or Elm Street movie, but every minute of the movie has a very eerie feeling about it.It's just a shame, that some of the things in the movie is down right stupid. Firstly, if they lost the map, why didn't they just look at the filmed material where they actually filmed the map, it was clearly enough so you could navigate around with it. And throwing away the map was pretty stupid too, but that's a whole other thing.Secondly, the witch's (or whatever it was) 'spell' couldn't possibly reach the whole forest. At some point they (if they hadn't changed directions, and stopped all the time) would have been far enough away to avoid the spell and get out of the forest.And another thing, it's pretty odd that Heather kept filming every time something scary was happening (like when the children attacked their tent). If I were attacked by something in the middle of the night I think I would do something else than film the whole damn thing. But apart from that, I think that this was a great movie. I really sat on the edge of my seat at many points (which doesn't happen very often).I highly recommend this movie.I rate this movie 8 out of 10",9,1,2,21 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not quite what I had hoped for
","This was the most anticipated movie of all time, period. No one knew exactly what the movie would be about, only that it would lift a curtain of Darth Vader's past.This movie was WAY to hyped. I mean in a big way. But who could blame anyone? This wouldn't just be another new movie release. It was the next installment in the Star Wars saga.Being a very big fan of the original trilogy, I also got caught up in the hype. I was sure that this movie would be the greatest event in motion picture history.Boy was I disappointed. Firstly the story itself isn't that good. Most of the movie concentrates on politics and debates. Come on! This isn't Star Wars! I want action and adventure! Not a bunch of people sitting around and discussing some issues about a trade federation. Although there is a few action-sequences in it, they don't really impress me that much. The last scenes with Darth Maul and the two Jedis is in my opinion the highlight of the movie.Secondly, the characters are a bit thin. You don't really get to know them that well because the movie switches scenes every two seconds. And that's a petty. A big part of the excitement of the first trilogy, was that you felt that you went through the adventures with Han Solo, Luke Skywalker etc. Because you cared for them in some way.But I don't care much for the characters in this one. The actors does a pretty good job, especially Liam Neeson, who I think was too good for the part. He didn't have much to work with.One actor I really didn't like in this movie, was Jake Lloyd. Okay he's just a kid, but he's an actor too. Many of his dialogues sound forced in some strange way. He's not convincing. Darth Maul really had great potential but he didn't appear in that many scenes. And he almost never said anything!But the character I hated the most, was Jar Jar Binks. I find him incredibly annoying and stupid. I know that the movie is primarily targeted at children, but this is just too much. He's even worse than those Ewoks!The effects were astounding, although a bit cartoony in some places (the battle between the Gungans and the Battle droids). The incredible Pod-race was a work of art. Although I found that segment a bit needless.John Williams' score is very good. But I must say that I liked the original music from the first movies better.All in all a bit of a disappointment. It's not a bad movie, it just got too much hype, and it didn't deliver.But I think I will look at this movie differently, when I have seen the next two prequels.I rate this movie 7 out of 10.Here's for Episode II then, and George - please leave out Jar Jar Binks...",10,0,1,20 April 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Great!
","This movie has everything you could ask for; literally all the characters from the TV-show, foul language, great songs and a cool story.The movie is about a war starting between America and Canada due to a movie which stars 'Terrence & Philip'. All the parents in the movie gets shocked over the incredible amount of swearing and 'toilet humor' - as Kyle's mom puts it - there is in the Canadian movie. Kyle's mom can't have that, and starts a group of angry mothers to have the movie taken down from the cinemas. The whole country makes Terrence & Philip a common enemy, and arrests them. Canada responds with a bombing of an American house.America declares war on Canada, and the children have to stop it, so the form a group to help free Terrence & Philip.Everything in it is hilarious. Especially the relationship between Satan and Sadam Hussein.All in all a movie that has many great elements and a real surprising ending.I would rate this 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,19 April 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Seen before
","The first Jurassic Park movie is in my opinion one of the best of it's kind ever. And it made a huge amount of money at the box office, so it didn't surprise they did a sequel.This movie though, isn't half as good as the first one.Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm in this sorry follow-up. This time, he has to stop an organization which tries to capture the dinosaurs and bring them to the mainland.With the aid of some friends he succeeds to mess it all up for the bad guys, but they still manage to bring a T-Rex along... The end is one of the movie's strongest points, but also one of the weakest. This is King Kong all over again for crying out loud! But it's pretty entertaining...Anyway, this movie has better effects than the first one, but that doesn't help much when the story is pretty bad.I would rate 'Jurassic Park': 9 out of 10, and 'The Lost World': 4 out of 10",Null,0,0,19 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The greatest movie of all time
","No words can do it justice, so I won't say a lot about it.I never watched it in the theaters back in 1977 because I wasn't born until six years later. I didn't grow with all the Star Wars craze, as many Star Wars fans did. I knew the movies existed, but I didn't take much notice of them.But all that changed...One day I noticed that 'Star Wars' was on TV, so I sat down and watched it.All though this was on television, it was one of the biggest movie experiences I ever had.The movie is pure perfection, with a great story, incredible effects (at least for that time) and some of the best music ever written for a movie. But what really got me impressed was the incredible attention to detail Lucas had. Every little being, alien, starship you name it, has some kind of history.I later watched the two other movies and got even more impressed, when I saw the whole story unfold.Now, I can't wait for the prequels (although 'Episode I' was a little disappointing...) too see the entire story.Quite simply the best movie ever made.I rate 'Star Wars' 11 out of 10",10,0,2,20 April 2000
