Requiem for a Dream," LIFE CHANGING
","This is a movie that will stay with you long after you have watched it, and probably the rest of your life.  If you watch this movie, be sure toget the un-edited version, it just makes the movie that much better.  Where can I begin describing this movie.  Well, the subject of the movie is addiction, all the characters are addicted to something in the movie, and it doesn't necessarily have to be drugs.  The climax of this movie is so powerful and riveting it makes you feel for the characters and where their lives are going.  The score to the movie is just as great as the movie itself and makes the emotional parts seem that much better.  There are great highs, and unimaginable lows.  This is one of my favorite movies, and I think every high school student should be forced to watch this movie if they are thinking about using and hard drugs.  WATCH THIS MOVIE, and buy it.

The Shining," WOW
",GREAT ACTING-  Jack Nicholson is truly scary in his portrayal of a man descending into the pits of insanity.  Shelly Duvall also makes you feel sorry for her and her son.  Possibly the best horror film ever made.'I'm only happy when it rains.' garbage,10,2,3,22 November 2002
