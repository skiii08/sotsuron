The Blair Witch Project," Dont believe the hype, this movie sucks!
","The Blair Witch Project is quite possible the dumbest movie i have ever seen, it was'ent scary or suspenseful at all.  The acting was good and the mood was right and the filmmakers did a wonderful job of fooling everyone into believing that this was a True Story, when it is not!  If you want to see a truly Suspenseful movie rent Aliens and if you want to see a real scary movie rent The Exorcist.",1,0,1,4 August 1999
