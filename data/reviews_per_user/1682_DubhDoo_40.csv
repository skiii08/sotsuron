Despicable Me 2," Charming and enjoyable fun
","In 2010, 'Despicable Me' was a surprise hit – it was not a sequel and came from a studio who had never had a huge success in the era of Pixar; but it was an enjoyable comedy that went on to gross nearly half a billion dollars worldwide, thus making a follow-up all but inevitable.'Despicable Me 2' finds former supervillain Gru (wonderfully voiced by Steve Carrell) in much less evil form, blissfully living with his three adopted orphans (and the minions), hosting birthday parties, sweetly dressing up as a fairy princess and making cupcakes and jellies. However, this idyllic life is interrupted by Anti-Villain League agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) who is partnered up with Gru to take down a nefarious villain. Despite some good gags involving Gru, the real stars of the show are the little yellow Minions. They're given significantly more screen time here than in the original, but thankfully it rarely feels like overkill, instead they're a reliable source of laughter whenever they are on screen, whether chopping through a wall, singing a lullaby in gibberish talk or saying 'bottom' with a snigger. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig is given a relatively underwritten role and most of her jokes fall flat, despite some good voice acting.One of the flaws of 'Despicable Me 2' is how unfocused it is – the big villain behind it all barely gets a look-in, while the plot is muddled and slightly unengaging, but overall, this was easily forgivable, simply due to the charming nature of the movie. It's not earth-shattering and arguably not as good as its predecessor, but this sequel is consistently enjoyable, always managing to put a smile on my face and causing viewers young and old to erupt with laughter.",6,1,2,11 August 2013
The Avengers," A blast from Joss Whedon.
","So here it is. After nearly fifty years, The Avengers have finally made the transition from page to screen, and best of all, it does not manage to disappoint. Much of this is down to Joss Whedon and the pitch-perfect casting.At first, the choice of Whedon as director surprised me somewhat. I really like Whedon, don't get me wrong, but with a background in television and his most notable cinematic efforts being the screenplay for the first 'Toy Story' and the unfortunately overlooked 'Serenity', he struck me as an odd choice. But make no mistake, that even with millions more dollars at hand, Whedon fortunately remains true to himself; keeping humour in sight, with plenty of instantly quotable quips and wisecracks throughout. He is confident and assured with these treasured characters, managing to juggle all these superheroes (and one super ego).We're all used to (most of ) the cast members by now; Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Chris Evans as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Tom Hiddleston as Loki; but we also have some new players in the form of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as Hulk. What is most brilliant is that all the actors impress. I was eagerly anticipating seeing Evans as Rogers again, after falling in love with his solo effort, but it was in fact Ruffalo who struck me the most. His portrayal as the tortured Bruce Banner was nuanced, believable and very human, applying emotion to a difficult role. Hiddleston was true pleasure as the villainous Loki, giving a fantastic performance and wonderfully delivering many great lines.One quibble I had was Hawkeye's lack of screen-time, but that can be ignored as I suspect he will either get a spin-off or have a larger role in the sequel. This is the very opposite to say Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy; instead of being dark, realistic and multi-layered, this is the very synthesis of a big, bright summer movie, a blast from start to finish with humour and large action sequences. While Loki's army were a bit too Transformers-esque for my liking, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film, and exited the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Overall, an excellent blockbuster which deserves the praise it's getting. All I want is for Whedon to the sequel.",9,6,14,17 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Holmes
","No one expected much from 2009's 'Sherlock Holmes'; Guy Ritchie doing Holmes with Robert Downey Jr.? Many predicted it to be a huge failure, but wait, it turned out to be surprisingly good; a rather likable action-packed mystery romp bolstered by sparkling chemistry between its two leads. It garnered a generally positive critical reception and enjoyed box-office success, thus making a sequel inevitable. 'A Game of Shadows' follows Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) as they encounter the sinister Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) and are forced to partake in a mysterious game of cat-and-mouse to outwit the cunning villain.This film's predecessor largely worked because of its well-matched leads; its story was relatively simple and nothing special, however the note-perfect casting of the detective duo managed to elevate the movie to heights it may not have reached otherwise. Downey Jr. continues on the path he strode on the first film, bringing a certain degree of swagger to Conan Doyle's iconic creation, inducing him with a few drops of the action hero charm and irresistible charisma he so perfectly honed as Tony Stark. While Jude Law, essentially the straight man, acts as a great foil to his partner and also gets a number of moments to shine, one in the film's third act is surprisingly touching. It's the dynamic between them though that makes this movie what is; they are the new Butch and Sundance, as far as I'm concerned, bouncing off of each other brilliantly and giving the film its beating heart and soul. When Daniel Day Lewis was originally cast as the iconic villain Moriarty, I found myself in a state of glee; however, he eventually passed on the offer to portray the title character in Steven Spielberg's much-delayed 'Lincoln'. Jared Harris was cast instead and after being rather good in 'Mad Men' he continues to impress, proving a formidable antagonist to our heroes, exuding a presence of unmistakable menace. He shares a number of great scenes with Downey Jr., most notably their first meeting and a third-act game of wits. The reliable Stephen Fry lightens the mood as Holmes' brother Mycroft, while the fantastic Noomi Rapace is unfortunately wasted in a rather bland role.This being a Guy Ritchie movie means action; so yes, the slo-mo of the first film returns, but thankfully doesn't manage to outstay its welcome (just about). There are fisticuffs, explosions, shootouts and big collapsing buildings. Holmes' near-superhuman fight-strategising skills also reappear throughout. Fortunately, all the action sequences don't manage to get in the way of a rather engaging story, with a script more intelligent and complex than that of its predecessor, with the writers wisely devoting some of the standout moments to encounters between Moriarty and Holmes. The film also moves at the pace of a freight train, continuously galloping forward, never leaving the viewer bored or unengaged, as the plot zips from London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland in Bond-like motion, making a nice contrast to the London- only setting of the original. To put it simply: this film is bigger, bolder, funnier and better than the first, with even more bromance between Law and Downey Jr. and much more memorable villain. Building upon the strengths of the first movie, this is easily Guy Ritchie's best film yet, with snappy one-liners, exciting action, humour and moments of genuine emotion. Let's just hope that third time really is the charm.",8,0,1,3 January 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An affectionate and likable teen drama
","American high-school movies. Yes another one. In tackling the pitfalls and plateaus of adolescence, many films have fallen along the bad side of cliché, however it's important to remember that like every genre (well, nearly) it has had its successes; for me, John Hughes seminal The Breakfast Club instantly springs to mind, along with others such as Pretty in Pink, Mean Girls and Clueless. Fortunately, The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes a decent stab at falling into the same category as these films; and while it doesn't scale to their heights, it's a surprisingly likable coming-of-age drama.Based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 bestseller on the same name (he also writes and directs here), the film concerns freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) as he experiences difficulty at home and school. However, he falls in with a group of seniors, including Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him what is to be a 'wallflower'. He encounters depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, homophobia, love, heartbreak, David Bowie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.I was sincerely taken aback by the fact that Charlie did not annoy me; too many high-school films and TV shows nowadays centre of smart- mouthed, wiser-than-their years teens, so it was refreshing to have one relatable and natural. This is mainly due to Lerman who delivers a sincere and engaging performance. While Emma Watson shows clear evidence of a career beyond Potter. However, it's Miller who's the standout; after holding his own with the brilliant Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, he doesn't disappoint, despite being saddled with the 'flamboyant gay best friend' role.Chbosky's direction is nothing to marvel at and the script not one of the year's best, but overall, to quote South Park's Deapartment of Interior Security Guy, it's 'fine, just fine'. A sweet, enjoyable and honest look at those years we'll never forget.",6,11,21,18 October 2012
Skyfall," Daniel Craig returns with a bang in the best Bond yet
","'You know the rules of the game, you've been playing it all these years', says Judi Dench to Craig's James Bond in an early scene. This line mirrors the importance of this year in the 007 canon; it has been half a decade since Sean Connery first donned the tux in Dr. No and over that time we've come to know Mr. Bond and experience the good, the bad and the ugly. For Skyfall, this birthday had to be kept in mind, as following the disappointing mess-and-a-half that was Quantum of (any?) Solace, the film had to be good, first and foremost, but it also couldn't be your regular Bond adventure - something had to change. Fortunately, director Sam Mendes (who worked with Craig on Road to Perdition) has breathed new life into this long- running franchise, taking bold moves that pay-off brilliantly.During an attempt to recover sensitive information from an enemy operative, Bond is mistakenly shot by a fellow agent (Naoime Harris). But when a cyber-terrorist (Javier Bardem) targets MI6, Bond returns, however he finds his loyalty to M tested as her past comes to haunt her.'All the physical stuff, so dull', remarks Bardem's Silva in his first encounter with Bond. However, the same cannot be said for the film's action sequences - they are magnificent and exhilarating. From the Istanbul-set pre-credits scene to a heart-pounding chase which occurs on the London Underground, Skyfall delivers some of the best action since Bane came to Gotham or Iko Uwais had a few floors to climb. All these sequences are aided not only by Sam Mendes, but also by Roger Deakins' extraordinary cinematography, bringing a majesty to these scenes to rival Wally Pfister's recent work with Christopher Nolan. Highlights include a scrap inside a Shanghai skyscraper lit entirely by neon advertising and the one shot/ single take introduction to the antagonist.In Casino Royale, Daniel Craig took us all by storm, but with Quantum of (I don't see any) Solace, he experienced an unfortunate stumble; thankfully, within the opening seconds of Skyfall you can breathe a sigh of relief as Mr. Craig basically tells the audience that he's back and this time he means business. He has also never been better in the role, making it entirely his own and delivering sharp one-liners with dry and sardonic wit, whilst retaining nuance emotion and grit. Yet, this 23rd Eon outing belongs to Judi Dench just as much as it does to Craig; it has taken seven films, but M has finally been given the film she deserves, proving every bit as engaging ad 007 - she is the definitive Bond girl. Bardem is a wonderful standout in this impeccable cast; mildly camp, but properly menacing, he brings depth to the normally one-dimensional role of the 'Bond villain'.Yet much of the film's greatness belongs to Sam Mendes, he takes many audacious risks that most directors would pass over in favour of Bond conventions, and while the film's first hour does feature many of them, its second half delves into Bond and M's pasts, before descending to a Straw Dogs (Peckinpah)-esque Scotland-set third act, which oddly works. He brings a sophistication to the series, allowing a reading of Tennyson to sit seamlessly alongside a cameo from a particular car. This isn't just a brilliant Bond film, this is a brilliant film fullstop. Undoubtedly one of the films of the year, it's exciting, funny, tense and emotional - the 50th anniversary has brought with it the best Bond yet. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again.",9,13,29,29 October 2012
Iron Man 3," Tony Stark returns in the best 'Iron Man' yet
","Following a film like 'The Avengers' for is no easy feat for even one of the most successful film franchises around today. After becoming the biggest box office smash of 2012 (taking over a billion in little more than a week) and garnering unanimously positive reviews, it was undeniable that 'The Avengers' successor would come with high expectations, as not only is 'Iron Man 3' following 'The Avengers', but it also marks the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase One and the beginning of the series' Phase Two. After the disappointingly flat 'Iron Man 2', Jon Favreau left the chair (while keeping his acting role as Happy Hogan) and passed it on to 'Lethal Weapon' scribe Shane Black. Any doubts of Iron Man continuing on the poor quality of the first sequel swiftly exit the premises, because it is clear - that like Joss Whedon – Shane Black has expertly taken the source material in his hands and placed a big personal stamp all over it. Of course this means that we are treated to a cracking script that brims with sparkling one-liners that feature some great references to everything from Croydon to 'Downtown Abbey'), but there is also a real sense of human depth and development to the characters more than ever before. And being a Shane Black film, it is set at Christmas. 'Iron Man 3' finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) experiencing PTSD after the events in 'New York' at the end of 'The Avengers'; he is paranoid, suffering from insomnia and anxiety attacks. However, when a Middle-Eastern terrorist The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) issues multiple assaults on the US, Tony vows that he will face him...It's no great secret that Robert Downey Jr's ever-great turn as Tony Stark is one of the greatest assets in Marvel's arsenal, so it is unsurprising that many of this film's high points are when Stark is out of the suit. After having worked with Black on his directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', it is clear to see that he and Downey Jr. form a great team; Black's knack for sharp dialogue is perfectly suited to the actor and works to laugh-out-loud effect in some scenes. The other actors are also given more to do than in previous installments, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow's as Stark's beau Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes, who forms a double-act with Stark that's not entirely dissimilar to Riggs and Murtaugh.While Black has written scripts for nearly thirty years (becoming Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter at one point), this is only his second film as director, so it's a pleasant surprise that the action sequences are so well-directed conceived and directed, comparatively better than any other in the trilogy so far. A stunning first-act assault on Stark's home and a near breathtaking plane set piece are real standouts. Unfortunately, the final reel's battle, while well-staged, falls somewhat flat.Ultimately, 'Iron Man 3' is – while not as good as last year's biggest hitter – arguably the best solo outing for Tony Stark. It's consistently funny and occasionally heartwarming (especially in the bond Stark forms with a young boy), with great action and strong performances that are aided by an excellent script. Also, without giving too much away, let's just saw that Kingsley's performance as The Mandarin is quite good, just not in that way you'd expect. Marvel's Phase Two has gotten off to a hugely enjoyable start.Also, stay until the very end of the credits. It's a Marvel movie after all.",7,1,8,2 May 2013
World War Z," Better than expected
","'World War Z' hasn't had an easy road to the big screen. Work on the film began around 2006 and from then on, the production was troubled. Brad Pitt became involved early on, putting up much of his own money for it – with his production company Plan B – yet even he must have been worried when he saw how difficult the making of the film was becoming. Directors were changed and the script passed through the hands of about five scriptwriters. The budget started out somewhere around $120 – 130 million, but it continued to rise and is now reported to be over $200 million. Rumours abounded reporting tensions between Pitt and director Marc Forster. Then, the original ending was entirely scraped, so reshoots were required to somehow be weaved into the existing narrative. After all this trouble, I went into 'World War Z' expecting a mess with cracks evident on screen. However, in a pleasant surprise, it flows nicely with the new ending working seamlessly.This film is many things, but it isn't really an adaptation of Max Brooks' 2003 novel of the same name, even though it started out as such. Brooks' acclaimed novel has a multi-narrative structure that would better lend itself to a TV show as opposed to a film. Whereas the book concerns multiple narrators, the movie solely follows ex-UN official Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who experiences a zombie outbreak first-hand, narrowly escaping the chaos with his family. However, his former boss asks him to travel the world to search for a possible cure for the pandemic.Most zombie movies and TV shows (good or bad) take place after the initial outbreak, whether it be 'The Walking Dead', or Danny Boyle's brilliant '28 Days Later'. In a refreshing turn, 'World War Z' depicts the outbreak the minute it happens, and these scenes are some of the best in the film, conveying a frenzied feeling of panic. It feels what it would really be like - cars crash, people scramble in every direction, disaster everywhere. Secondly, the majority of zombie films and shows find their characters confined to a small area; for example, the shopping centre 'Dawn of the Dead'. One of the best aspects of 'World War Z' is that it shows the zombie pandemic on a global scale, with the central character travelling from the U.S. to Korea to Israel to Wales. This globe-trotting element provides the film with some thrilling setpieces, in particular the relentless scenes where thousand- strong swarms of zombies flood through the streets of Jerusalem or the initial panic in Philadelphia.Marc Forster is a director with a mixed back record – 'Stranger than Fiction' may have been great, but he followed it up with the huge disappointment that was 'Quantum of Solace' – thankfully, 'World War Z' is significantly better than the latter. It's no masterpiece, but it's a quite good and consistently enjoyable romp. Pitt delivers a solid performance and makes Lane an engaging protagonist. The lack of gore and the presence of fast zombies may annoy fans of the book and zombie traditionalists, but I found that both worked (especially the latter) in the context of the movie. It's not the book, but 'World War Z' is still a good film, especially after all the trouble it went through.",7,3,10,23 June 2013
The Hunger Games," A highly enjoyable and promising start to the series
","Gary Ross' film begins with Jennifer Lawrence living in a rural community, being the glue keeping together a fatherless, almost- penniless household, with the camera-work intimate and indie-styled, and the music sparse. But wait, this isn't a sequel to Winter's Bone, is it? No, instead what we have here is (as I'm sure you're aware) the much anticipated adaptation of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games (Collins also serves as one of the film's three screenwriters), set in a post- apocalyptic US entitled Panem, where, in order to keep the youth in line and civil order maintained, 24 randomly selected 12-18 year olds are forced to fight to the death until one remains.Of all the good things about the film, its shining star comes in the form of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen; from the moment she steps on screen she exudes a magnetic, presence; her performance is strong, convincing, emotional, and at times, vulnerable. She's a firm and consistently engaging central figure, who only benefits the film, bringing it to heights it may not have otherwise reached. But it's not all that surprising when you take into account the fact that she's the second youngest actress ever to receive a nomination for the Best Actress Oscar. Lawrence is also backed up by a terrific supporting cast, including a shabbily charismatic Woody Harrelson, and even if he's only Basil Exposition, he's still enjoyable in the part; Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks are entertaining as media-minded Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland also make memorable impressions in significant roles with small screen time. However, Toby Jones barely utters a word. I was taken aback by Josh Hutcherson, that while he may not be a astounding actor, he works quite well as Peeta Mellark, in the occasionally damsel-in-distress-like role, being believably vulnerable against Lawrence's resilient Katniss and even if their chemistry doesn't sparkle just yet, there's three more films for it to catch fire (wocka wocka).While the film does indeed plant the seeds of love triangle, it is more focused on the Games themselves; And while Ross doesn't take the material's satirical promise as far as it could go, it's still laid on the table; making a statement about exploitation, the class divide, government distrust, repression and reality television. Because when you boil it down to its most basic, it is about kids killing kids. This could all have come across as strikingly tasteless on screen, but Ross works in the confines of a PG-13/12 certificate, effectively delivering violence that makes you feel the pain. He does this without making it overly gratuitous or alienating the target audience. The intense and frantic start to the Games illustrates this as we witness all the Tributes against each other, with bodies falling like dominoes and the horror of the carnage retained. The film is not without its flaws – Ross' frequent use of shaky-cam in the film's action sequences is understandable, but it makes the action somewhat confusing and dizzying (maybe that's the point), but in a particular fight, each blow is delivered in hand-held flashes detracting from my enjoyment of said scene. The pacing in the second half is also uneven, at times it feels brisk, at others overly slow; not that I have a problem with slow pacing, it's just that the briskness of the first half's pacing is slightly at odds with the second half's, where Ross appears in no rush. One last gripe I had was that the finale was anticlimactic, (it was obviously designed to lead into the sequel) but I'll say no more to avoid spoilers. Yet these are minor flaws that can be ignored as it didn't destroy the experience of the film, because from start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Many have made this clear and so will I: this is not the new Twilight, nor has it ever been - shoddy visual effects, stilted performances and cheesy dialogue are nowhere to be seen – instead this is something much better. More sophisticated than Twilight and darker than Harry Potter, this is a grounded, thoughtful, very well-acted and at times emotional film, which is also a very promising start to this franchise. Let's just hope the odds will ever be in its favour.",8,3,8,18 August 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," J.J. Abrams sets his phasers to stunning
","In 2009, J.J. Abrams successfully reinvigorated a flailing franchise in a manner that few saw coming. 'Star Trek' was an unexpected triumph and one of the best films of 2009. However, can lighting strike twice? Well, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is superb evidence that it can, because not only is it a great movie, but also one of those rare cases where the sequel betters the already good predecessor.The film finds Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew begin to fracture as their most powerful enemy yet, a terrorist within Starfleet, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) declares a one-man war on the organisation. After a number of terrorist attacks, Kirk decides to embark on a manhunt to stop this ruthless villain. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' opens with a blistering action sequence that sees the Kirk and 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) fleeing from a tribe of fierce natives, while Spock (Zachary Quinto) descends into an erupting volcano. Brilliantly, the pace doesn't let up, it rattles along at the speed of a freight train (or more appropriately, a starship at warp speed). If anything, this sci-fi sequel confirms J.J. Abrams as a master of pacing – no scene is too long, too short or drags in any way. The action setpieces – from a gunfight in a maze of ruins to a chase through San Francisco – are truly breathtaking.But with so much action, is much space allotted for the ensemble cast? The answer, thankfully, is yes. The Kirk/Spock dynamic (passionate hot- head and impassionate man of logic) has always been at the very core of Star Trek's appeal and here, it is at its very best. Much of this is down to top-notch performances from Pine and Quinto, who continue to work wonderfully together, and also separately. The other cast members all get their moments to shine, whether it's Scotty (Simon Pegg) drunk or Bones' cracking one liners ('Jim, you don't leave a heist when the runaway car has a flat tire!')A shining standout though, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the villainous Harrison. In the previous Trek instalment, Eric Bana's Nero made for a solid, if unremarkable foe; however such is not the case with Harrison. Cumberbatch is a formidably intimidating villain, made all the more menacing by his cold and calculating manner along with a sense of there being method to his madness. One of the best things about 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the perfect balance it strikes between being one for the fans and also a film that newcomers can readily enjoy. For the Trekkers, there are clever and often funny nods to the franchise (Tribbles! Gorns! Red Shirts!), but for people who've never seen anything Trek-related before, this is just as accessible – 'The aim was to make a movie that could stand on its own terms', Abrams outlined. This is a non-stop thrill-ride of a movie with three-dimensional characters, humour, rug-pulls, heart and plenty of lens flare. This isn't just a great sequel or a great 'Star Trek' movie; this is a great movie fullstop. 'Star Wars VII' is in very safe hands indeed.",7,5,18,14 May 2013
Ted," A continuation of Seth MacFarlane's descent into awfulness
","I was a fan of Family Guy, but emphasize the use of past tense. I thought its first three seasons were pretty consistently hilarious; after that it was uneven, but pretty funny when it was good; yet then it took a turn for the worst and just became unbearable, so I stopped watching. Before going to Ted, I tried to watch a new episode, but I couldn't sit through it. However the good reviews that this film was garnering told me that maybe, just maybe, it might be better than I had previously hoped. Alas...It was pretty awful. From the start, I knew what I was in for, but I had hoped that over the course of its relatively brief runtime, it may pick up, and I would find myself in a state of hysterical laughter; yet I could only dream of it. We've seen this kind of clichéd plot before, usually without a bear, yet that didn't bother me going in, but some of the 'romantic' and 'heartfelt' were so generic and unoriginal I was bored to tears! I like Mark Wahlberg - brilliant in Boogie Nights and The Departed - but here, all he could do was work with what he was given, and that wasn't much. I'll admit, he made me guffaw, only once. The acting overall was nothing special and at times unengaging. There were a few nice cameos (hello Norah Jones, hello Sam Jones), but they were unfortunately wasted.And as for, the 'comedy'; it was nasty, obnoxious, crass, etc. Now, don't get the wrong idea, that I'm prude or anything, I love everything from Wonder Showzen to Trey Parker and Matt Stone's work to Bill Hicks, but I've seen the jokes here countless times in the past, and didn't find 'em funny the first time round. I adore risqué humour when it's trying to make a point or convey a message, not when it's there for a cheap laugh. A teddy bear humping a cash register is not funny. A teddy bear on weed is not funny. Obnoxiously insulting Brandon Routh is not funny. Especially six years on! If you're gonna make a joke about a celebrity try and do it when current and relevant. I wouldn't recommend this at all. If, for some godforsaken reason you still think Family Guy is great, then you'll probably lap this up, but if you thankfully don't, well then, steer clear of this turd. While watching this in the cinema, the audience were in uncontrollable bouts of laughter, while I had a bad taste in my mouth. With his live-action debut Seth MacFarlane had an opportunity to prove himself a great comedic talent, he's wasted it and opted to the lowest common denominator of unfunny, unoriginal and eye-rolling cheap laughs. If you want the comedy of the year so far, go watch 21 Jump Street.",2,7,13,7 August 2012
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen at his blissful best
","The opening of 'Midnight in Paris' is not promising. The 41st film from Woody Allen begins with a montage that practically revels in the world of cliché with its depiction of Paris – there's people sitting outside cafés, some smooth jazz, flower shops, art galleries, berets, affluence, the Eiffel Tower; the only thing missing is a man in a striped top carrying a baguette. Then it's only ten minutes before Carla Bruni shows up. Essentially, it's an opening that is the polar opposite to the beginning of 'La Haine'. After this gorgeously-shot montage which felt almost like a tourist advertisement, I was uncertain about how the remainder of the film would pan out. Thankfully, any worry quickly evaporated as I found myself irresistibly charmed by it.In line with Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' it sees the prolific filmmaker once again venturing into fantastical territory, as Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter holidays to Paris with his beau, Inez (Rachel McAdams) in the hope of successfully completing his debut novel, only to find himself magically whirled back in time, coincidentally to his favourite era – the Roaring Twenties. Here, he gets swept up in meeting a host of significant figures from the Parisian Café Society.These twenties-set scenes were the shining highlights in all-round wonderful film. Tom Hiddleston's F. Scott Fitzgerald is tailored and well-spoken with an affinity for the phrase 'old sport'. Alison Pill's Zelda Fitzgerald is unpredictable and somewhat uncontrollable with a fondness for alcohol. Corey Stoll's Ernest Hemmingway spouts profound literary advice while retaining love for a good fisticuff ('You box?'). Adrian Brody's Salvador Dalí is expectedly eccentric and insists of the proper pronunciation of his name ('Da-lee!'). The movie is full of other such people that appear only briefly, but if like me, you share Gil's love for Café Society culture, you'll struggle not to smile when they show up. I never really thought much of Owen Wilson as an actor, but here - essentially inhabiting the Woody Allen role - he proves to be a charming leading main and much like the film itself, very likable, because even though 'Midnight in Paris' is undeniably clichéd in its portrayal of Paris and the various historical figures, this all adds to the delightful charms of the movie. It is very light and even frothy entertainment, but this is a cracking little film that left a huge smile on my face. To use that saying Allen loves so dearly, it's 'amusing'. But y'know what? It's actually more than that, it's pure brilliance.",9,2,4,25 March 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg delivers a rollicking adventure that never loses sight of its source material
","Prior to watching Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin' adaptation, I decided to read the three Hergé stories upon which it is based, 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. I instantly fell in love them, finding them to be simple and innocent yet rollicking and charming adventures nonetheless. Despite the mixed response to their big screen counterpart, I felt at ease going in; why? Well, a film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, scored by John Williams and written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish couldn't be bad could it? Thankfully, the answer was positive, with the film turning out to be far more enjoyable than expected.'The Adventures of Tintin' follows the eponymous character (Jamie Bell) and his dog and loyal companion Snowy as they stumble across a model of a sailing ship called the 'Unicorn', this attracts the attention of the villainous Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who desperately desires the secrets it holds, which results in a globe-trotting adventure as Tintin encounters the not-exactly-sober Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) whilst attempting to foil Sakharine's plan to stop them as they try to uncover the mystery the 'Unicorn' has to offer...It's been quite a while since Spielberg last delivered a rollicking romp – War of the Worlds was let down Dakota Fanning's never ending screams and a too convenient ending, Munich was rather good but not exactly classic Spielberg and as for 'Crystal Skull', well, let's not go there. So it was time for the Maestro of the Blockbuster to make another adventure that could sit nicely alongside 'ET', 'Jurassic Park', 'Jaws', etc, and with 'Tintin' he has done exactly that. Of all the Spielberg films, 'the Adventures of Tintin's' closest cousin is (unsurprisingly) 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. In fact, no more than two years after Indy's debut on the silver screen did Hergé give the director his blessing as the only man capable of successfully translating his creation to the big screen. Spielberg is a man who knows how to handle the beloved Belgian reporter and it is clear that both he and his key companion, producer Peter Jackson adore the source material. Whether it's Hergé's 'cameo' at the beginning of the film, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it inclusion of 'Le Vingtième Siècle' (the first paper Tintin appeared in) or the similarly fan-pleasing appearance of Bianca Castafiore, it is undeniable that the dynamic duo possess deep reverence for the original comics. However, Spielberg and Jackson understand that Hergé's creation and most of the world outside Central Europe have not enjoyed a lengthy waltz, so this is more than just a film for Tintinologists, presenting newcomers with a fast-paced and deeply enjoyable adventure tale. It has moments of humour that children and adults can enjoy simultaneously and great set- pieces, most notably the breathtaking Baghar-set chase sequence, which is, in my opinion, one of the finest actions sequences Spielberg has ever produced. After Robert Zemeckis' 'The Polar Express' retreated into 'uncanny valley' with a one-way ticket, some doubted the potential of fully mo- capped feature films. Spielberg has learnt from Zemeckis' unfortunate mistakes, utilizing the technology by portraying things quite unfilmmable (an army tank unwillingly carrying a hotel through a busy market anyone?) and performing wonderful camera moves, best seen where Haddock tells the intrepid reporter of his ancestor, Sir Francis and the sea battle he was part of, with the lens seamlessly flowing between his telling of the story and the battle itself, helping to build momentum retain the brisk pace and immerse the viewer in the heart of the action.The film has its flaws though; Daniel Craig's villain is somewhat drippy and bland, the final set piece is a bit anticlimactic and some of the Thomson's gags fall flat, but in the end, these minor problems do little to affect the movie as a whole. Jamie Bell remains the 'blank canvas' of the comics and is likable all the same, however it is Andy Serkis who stands out in the cast; no surprises there. He is perfectly suited to the role of Haddock, giving the character a Scottish accent, but the film its heart. Overall, this is an enjoyable romp for viewers young and old, both familiar and not with the source material. It's action-packed, visually beautiful, light in tone and great entertainment. When choosing a suitable filmmaker, Hergé couldn't have been more right.",8,1,2,2 January 2013
Life of Pi," A beautiful and engrossing adventure from Ang Lee
","In a manner somewhat similar to the recent adaptation of David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas', 'Life of Pi' shouldn't work. Based on the award-winning and widely-lauded 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel, it chronicles the life-changing maritime adventure of a young Indian boy humorously named Piscine or 'Pi' for short, who after a surviving the sinking of a ship, ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and of course, a large Bengal tiger called Richard Parker (a moniker that came about wittily). Consequently, the book came to considered 'unfilmmable' (and for just cause), yet the world of cinema's interest in Martel's wonderful novel remained undying and after much development the proposed adaptation eventually landed at the feet of the excellent Ang Lee. Despite Lee's having proved himself to be a director of considerable talent, with superb offerings like 'The Ice Storm' and 'Brokeback Storm', themselves both adaptations, it was doubtful whether or not the much-loved novel would translate successfully to the big screen. Many other accomplished directors have failed to capture similarly ambitious novels in film form, such as David Lynch's folly that was 'Dune'. Any worry has turned out to be unnecessary though as the Taiwanese filmmaker has delivered a beautiful and moving film that is easily one of his finest works yet. There's no denying that 'Life of Pi' is filled with visual beauty, as in teaming up with DoP Claudio Miranda, Lee has utilised the film's ocean setting like an impressionistic artist to a blank canvas. Even though it is a scene that has done the rounds in the film's trailers, the night- set scene where the whale leaps out of the water is a thing of breathtaking majesty. Similarly, there are numerous moments that are nothing short of gorgeous in a way that could see even Terrence Malick become envious. Adding to this, the use of CGI is one of the most remarkable in recent years, exemplified with the meticulous detail put into Richard Parker, which renders him a significant achievement in CGI, as it becomes rather difficult to tell when the tiger is real or not.Yet, it's worth noting that this is a film that resonates on an emotional level as well as a technical. From the moment proceedings kicked off, I was engrossed in Pi's story, with its smooth fluidity, whether I was looking at Irrfan Khan or Suraj Sharma. The latter, a first time actor, delivers a great and at times subtle performance as the titular character, consistently helping me to engage with Pi and ultimately, like him. Even as he was simply sitting upon a raft in silence, I still couldn't help but find myself enthralled in the journey he had (unwillingly) embarked on.'Life of Pi' is a wonderful film, bursting with imagination and in love with the possibilities of storytelling, which sees Ang Lee wield 3-D expertly, forgoing the usual gimmicky 'things leaping out of the screen' and instead adding more depth and texture to the colourful cinematography. It's not just a technical marvel, but a true wonder all round, because the fact that Martel's novel actually works (rather well, at that) as a film is quite a miracle, and for Ang Lee should applauded.",8,9,16,9 March 2013
Pacific Rim," 'Pacific Rim' does what it promises with a great sense of fun
","At first glance, 'Pacific Rim' may seem like Guillermo Del Toro selling out – it's his first blockbuster with a budget shy of $200 million, featuring giant robot battles. However, this film is no sell-out; it is clearly a Guillermo Del Toro movie, maybe not as much as 'Pan's Labyrinth' or 'Hellboy' were, but a Guillermo Del Toro movie nonetheless. It is possibly his most personal – he said one of the reasons he made was 'to reconnect with his inner eleven year old', being inspired by all the Kaiju movies he marvelled as a child.The film opens with a narration by the protagonist, Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) chronicling how giant monsters (Kaijus) emerged from a portal in the Pacific Ocean and began to destroy cities. In response, mankind developed giant robots (called Jaegers) piloted by two people to destroy them. Now, with the threat worse then ever, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back into action so that they can 'cancel the apocalypse'.'Pacific Rim' might not be as deep or nuanced as some of Del Toro's previous work, but as a giant monster movie it's faultless. You want giant robots hitting giant monsters? You got it. The action sequences here are some of, if not the best, the Mexican filmmaker has directed, they're easy to follow, beautifully staged, exciting and most importantly, great fun to watch. When hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, pummelled a Kaiju with a large ship, I couldn't help but smile. And that's one of the best things about the movie – it is pure fun from start to finish, making a nice change from the dark, brooding blockbusters that are around today. It has a light tone with some silly humour (courtesy of the zany scientist duo) and a lovely cameo from Del Toro regular Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau (continuing the film's line of brilliantly-named characters).Sure, you could criticise the film for having one-dimensional characters, clunky dialogue and a thin plot, but when said film is so exuberantly fun, these things don't matter one bit. I was always engaged with the characters, rooting for them as they battled the Kaiju, despite the fact that they weren't exactly original creations. This is undoubtedly helped by the fact that performances are solid all-around, particularly Idris Elba who makes the often cheesy 'call-to-arms-speech' rousing. As pure entertainment, this is one of the best films of the year so far, it's a Kaiju movie that also looks and feels like a live- action anime film. Robots vs. monsters? 'Pacific Rim' does what it says on the tin and frankly, that's enough.",9,19,31,11 August 2013
Rush," Funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving, 'Rush' is a terrific movie, not just for F1 fans
","For whatever reason, the sport of Formula One is one that hasn't been served incredibly well in the movies. Aside from Asif Kapadia's 'Senna', there haven't really been any shining standouts. Thankfully, 'Rush' the latest movie from Ron Howard (reteaming with his 'Frost/Nixon' screenwriter Peter Morgan) is excellent, managing to make someone with no knowledge of the sport (i.e. this writer) compelled during the race sequences and throughout the entire championship. The movie centres on the rivalry between two F1 racers during the 1970s – the British playboy James Hunt and the disciplined Austrian Niki Lauda, played by Chris Hemswoth and Daniel Brühl respectively – and particularly during the 1976 Championship. This chalk-and-cheese relationship is at the very heart of 'Rush', with the differences between the two painted broadly, but effective nonetheless. Hunt is a racing pop star – with a legion of screaming fans and tendency to the go to a party after race. Lauda, on the other hand, is socially-inept and rigidly determined to win the championship, consequently being unafraid to speak his mind as he calls an extremely expensive Ferrari made for him, 'a s***box'. Hemsworth plays Hunt in a way similar to how he played Thor but still gives a good performance, while Brühl once again proves him to be a great actor, delivering a terrific and always engaging performance as Lauda. It wouldn't be a great surprise if he picks up some major acting nominations.The race scenes in 'Rush' are a sight to behold – Howard uses every trick going to make them exciting and he succeeds. With the shadow of death looming over each race, they are simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying, particularly Nüburgring in Germany, as Lauda and Hunt dart furiously around an incredibly dangerous track in extremely stormy weather conditions. Aiding these sequences, are Anthony Dod Mantle's excellent cinematography, some roaring sound design and Hans Zimmer's score, which sounds unlike much of his recent work, wonderfully sounding like The Edge from U2 at times and at others like Ramin Djawadi's score for 'Game of Thrones'. 'Rush' is easily one of the best movies Ron Howard has directed in recent years, (it's a vast improvement on 'The Dilemma', that's for sure) and possibly one of his best films in general. You could level numerous complaints at the film, that many of the characters are thinly- drawn or that the script isn't up to the standard of 'Frost/Nixon', but when said movie is emotionally engaging with heart-pounding races, such flaws don't even register. It may not break the mould, but 'Rush' is funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving.",7,3,5,21 September 2013
Oblivion," Unoriginal, but enjoyable sci-fi
","Despite being marketed as both 'groundbreaking' and 'original', 'Oblivion is neither. Joseph Kosinki's follow-up to 2010's surprisingly likable 'Tron Legacy', contains elements of so many sci-fi movies that we've seen before – there's 'Total Recall', '2001: a Space Odyssey', 'Moon', 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes' etc. There's a good chance that you may have seen at least one of those and thus, you will probably recognise something from them in 'Oblivion'. However, that's not to say this is a bad film by any means – it's not – but it isn't anything remotely new.In an opening voice-over, Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper outlines how a group of aliens called Scavengers (nicknamed 'Scavs') obliterated half of the moon and engaged in a war with the people of Earth, who eventually won the war with the use of nuclear weapons, which consequently damaged the planet's ecosystem. The majority of the Earth's population consequently embarked on a giant spacecraft. Jack Harper, one of only two people left on the planet, is a repairman who fixes drones to help rebuild the Earth's ecosystem. Yes, sort of like a human version of 'WALL-E'. However, when a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) falls from the sky (literally), Harper begins to question all he knew.Cruise, a perfectly fine screen presence, holds the screen very well and remains a consistently engaging figure throughout. His performance here is nothing to champion his work in 'Magnolia' or 'Born on the Fourth of July', but he makes Harper a likable lead. Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough try their best with the material, despite being given two arguably underwritten roles. Morgan Freeman unfortunately, is wasted with little more to do than act as Basil Exposition, although to be fair, no one delivers exposition quite like Freeman. Nikolaj Coaster Waldau is similarly wasted, which is a shame, given his ever-great turn as Jaime Lannister in 'Game of Thrones'.What helps the film greatly are its Claudio Miranda-shot visuals which are truly spectacular, from the pristine white of the sky tower's interior where Harper lives to the sight of the Brooklyn Bridge dangling between two sides of a chasm. The use of Iceland as the film's shooting location makes a nice change from many other sci-fi movies, with the country's natural beauty stunningly captured. 'Oblivion' is on a similar level to 'Tron Legacy'; it contains solid performances and strong visuals that manage to overcome a mediocre script, however its disappointingly ordinary M83 soundtrack doesn't rival Daft Punk's scoring on the latter. Overall, it's nothing you haven't seen before (aside from the beautiful Icelandic vistas), but if you want solidly enjoyable sci-fi action that's never boring, you got it.",6,2,6,20 April 2013
Man of Steel," 'Man of Steel' soars
","'Man of Steel' has arrived with a lot of expectation. It has been seven years since we last saw Superman on the big screen with Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns', but that film was seemingly loved by few (I was one of the few) and declared 'a flop', subsequently rendering the prospect of a new Superman film to be a make-or-break opportunity. As the film's production progressed, anticipation rightly built and this sense of anticipation was heightened when Christopher Nolan spearheaded the movie's production, bringing Zack Snyder in to direct his proposed reboot. So, after all this, does 'Man of Steel' live up anticipation? With a sigh of relief, I can safely say that it does.The plot of 'Man of Steel' is both familiar and fresh; we get the basic bones of Superman's origin story, but it is told in a way unlike anything we've seen before. It opens on the planet Krypton, which Jor-El (Russell Crowe) believes is on the verge of destruction. Going against the norm of manufactured birth, he and his wife, Lara (Ayelet Zurer) conceive their child naturally, and as the planet approaches its demise, Jor-El steals the planetary codex and filters it into his young son, Kal-El, before sending him into space, crash landing on Earth. Years later, Kal-El (Henry Cavill) has been raised on a farm by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and is now drifting between various jobs, everything from a fisherman to a bartender, leaving a variety of incidents in his wake, as he searches for himself. As an award-winning journalist named Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets on his tail, Kal-El discovers about his past, just as Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth, fiercely determined to retrieve the codex.A lot of common criticisms have been thrown at 'Man of Steel' since it premiered. Many have declared it to be 'too serious' and 'humourless'; many have said that there is too much action in the final act; that Henry Cavill isn't charismatic enough; that Lois Lane isn't developed enough, etc, etc. After seeing the film, I found it difficult to agree with the various and recurring criticisms. Yes, I acknowledge that this is the most serious Superman movie we've seen thus far, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This isn't intended to be Richard Donner's 'Superman', this is meant to be a new take on Superman, for a new generation. The third act is also pure action from start to finish, but this matters little, because A) we care about the characters involved, B) it's justified in the plot and C) it's really entertaining. Even though I love his hyper-stylised adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', 'Man of Steel' is arguably Zack Snyder's finest film to date. It is also his mature; there is no slow motion or music video-like scenes; and in the quieter and more reflective moments that make up the first half, he displays both a mature tone and a clear respect for the source material. It is also a joy to look at, whether it be the beautifully realised version of Krypton or the Kents' farm outside Smallville, especially thanks to Amir Mokri's great cinematography. Hans Zimmer complements these visuals with a wonderful score that helps to further establish this as a new take on Superman, helping the viewer to instantly forget about John Williams' iconic theme tune.However, 'Man of Steel' wouldn't be the great film it is if Krypton's last son wasn't cast right. Henry Cavill makes the role entirely his role, delivering the most developed portrayal we've seen of Superman on screen; he's by turns, confident, unsure, reflective and lost. He essentially makes a superhero often disregarded as 'too perfect' into a likable character that we really root for. Despite solid performances by Amy Adams, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne, it is the superb trio of Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner that best support Cavill. The brilliant Michael Shannon gives a great performance as Zod, making him a formidable villain. Crowe's turn as Jor-El is magnetic, while Costner's turn as Superman's adoptive dad is properly touching.'Man of Steel' was a movie that I anticipated for years and even with this undying level of anticipation, I cannot say I was disappointed at all. This film is super from start to finish, when Kal-El is and isn't in the iconic suit. Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have truly invigorated Superman in a way that should please old fans and make new ones. With spectacle, thrills and emotion, 'Man of Steel' soars.",6,3,7,22 June 2013
Hugo," Technically marvellous, yet unfortunately disappointing
","Maybe I missed something, but this should have been a truly great. Yes, I'm well aware that many have proclaimed it to be exactly that, with numerous critics placing it on their 'top 10 of 2011' lists, however, I cannot say that I was so taken with the 22nd film from Martin Scorsese. The book, by Brian Selznick, upon which this film was based was quite wonderful, an inventive mixture of the graphic novel and the children's book with flourishes no doubt indebted to early cinema. Once it was announced that Scorsese (a favourite of mine) would be adapting it and making what was essentially his first children's film, I was rather excited. It follows a young orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) who lives alone in a Parisian train station. In his possession lies a mysterious automaton, which arouses the curiosity of the bitter old toymaker Georges (Ben Kingsley) and results in our hero going on an adventure of sorts with Georges' granddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), whilst simultaneously trying to avoid the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen).It is clear to see that the great director poured his heart and soul into this film, most notably through its exploration of silent films. We see Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd et al, in fantastic clips from old classics. Then we have Georges Melies, who Ben Kingsley's character is revealed to be. He delivers quite possibly the film's best and most touching scene, where he takes Hugo and his granddaughter through his history as filmmaker, making countless silent pictures including his best known work 'A Trip to the Moon'. With all this, Scorsese is paying deep respect to these filmmakers and stars, and subsequently acknowledging the lasting influence they've had on his work. It's just a shame then that film feels so, well, emotionless. Sure, it was a joy to see such classics of the silent era once more, but what does that matter when the main characters aren't engaging on an emotional level? I only found myself longing to watch those films as opposed to the one at hand. Did I care for Hugo? No, not really, and that's what ruined it for me. I knew I was supposed to like these characters and connect with them, but I just didn't.On the plus side, the film looks absolutely beautiful, as Robert Richardson's cinematography has a consistent majestic elegance throughout, seen no better than in a sweeping opening shot which takes us on a brief trip through the station concluding in a nice introduction to the titular character. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is as reliable as ever, while the similarly reliable Howard Shore adds another impressive score to his repertoire and John Logan delivers a more-than-solid screenplay. The acting is all fairly consistent also, whether it's Sacha Baron Cohen's moustache-twirling Inspector, Ben Kingsley reflective turn as the brilliant French filmmaker or even Asa Butterfield who successfully holds his own as the lead. It also had a lovely level of innocence, something unfortunately missing from so many children's films today.So with all aspects of the film so well done, why don't I think it's great? Because it feels as if something is missing, some vital ingredient to give that extra oomph. Similar to a functioning automaton, all its parts work very well and competently, but in the end it's just a bit too mechanical. As I stated earlier, it is clear that this is a movie which means a lot to Scorsese, with it essentially being a well- crafted love letter to early cinema. Unfortunately, he has delivered an odd beast: a deeply personal yet impersonal movie.",6,2,4,2 January 2013
Warrior," Unoriginal, clichéd and predictable; brilliant, powerful and moving
","Here's an odd thing: Warrior is unoriginal, predictable, clichéd and (almost) formulaic, yet it still manages to be one of the most, entertaining, powerful, moving and brilliant films I've seen in the past few years.It basically, as you probably are aware, revolves around the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) and MMA, which is a bludgeoning blend of, well, whatever you like really. The fight sequences here are much more brawl-like and despite a PG-13 rating, are a brutal flurry of punches and elbows; which thanks to Gavin O'Connor's impressive direction allow the viewer to actually feel each blow, to occasional cringe-worthy effect.At the centre of the film are three marvellous performances from Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte. Unsurprisingly, Hardy is practically impeccable, portraying a ex Marine, who's become a perfect storm of directed rage with strong emotional issues, which is wonderfully evident on screen to the point where his screen presence is almost intimidating. However, this makes it harder for him to win our sympathies, unlike Edgerton and Nolte; the former is a completely nice guy, in contrast to Hardy's angry and brooding unpleasantness. He is unusually liked by his class, referred to as 'Mr. C', a loving father and husband. In the hands of a lesser actor this genuine good guy could have become sickly sentimental, but Edgerton's charm and charisma manages to make his character work and easily likable. Nolte delivers a magnificent piece of acting, deserving of that Oscar nomination. His performance is so good, that he even manages to make a woefully clichéd line like 'If you could find some space in the bottom of your heart...', heartfelt and moving. He is truly a joy in it.With O'Connor's fantastic direction the film pulls on the heartstrings whether it's the emotional family drama or thrilling fights. That the two brothers eventually face other comes as no surprise, but it has a wonderful twist to it, as by the time we get to the climax you don't want either fighter to lose. Its emotional peak is the sort which finds you're insides singing in a stirring fashion. So overall, while hardly original, it is a great film that I wholeheartedly love, which means a lot, considering the fact that I don't enjoy sporting films.",8,2,4,1 July 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Warm and easy to like, with an appropriate title
","David O'Russell is a filmmaker who is no stranger to the Oscars. His 2010 boxing drama 'The Fighter' garnered seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and also managed to deservedly win two acting awards. Now, his most current film 'Silver Linings Playbook' has been nominated for an impressive total of eight, including the two highest honours, as well as receiving a nom in each of the four acting categories, becoming the first film do so since Warren Beatty's 'Reds' in 1981. But the question on the lips of many is 'does it really deserve to feature so strongly at this year's Oscars?' Yes and no, frankly.That's not to say that there's anything particularly bad about 'Silver Linings', it's perfectly fine, but is it the type of film that could viewed as being on even footing with some of the other Best Picture contenders? It's questionable, but as far as I'm concerned, I don't think so. Diluted down to its bare factors, it is essentially a feel- good romantic drama, which uses football as an instigator for father/son bonding in the way only an American movie could and depicts how people can manage to triumph over mental illness, in a manner that teeters into over-sentimentality. It isn't really anything you haven't seen before and becomes more predictable as the narrative progresses. Cooper's character is a teacher who has been released from a mental institution for nearly beating a fellow staff member to death, but we only get brief snatches of this as David O'Russell doesn't delve into the darker side of mental illness and instead softens any edges presenting us with an unashamed crowdpleaser, but this is something that is largely unforgivable as the film is ultimately rather charming.However, don't get the notion that this is some sickly saccharine inspirational tale the like of which have become all the common, because this is a film which manages to narrowly avoid such territory and also has a rather appropriate title. Amidst the predictability of the story, we are offered a silver lining in the form of the film's acting. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano Jr., the man readjusting to life after a stint in a Baltimore mental institution, and while he might not be one of the greatest actors of all time, he induces his character with a certain zest and charisma that even the most cynical viewer may struggle to resist. Jennifer Lawrence on the other hand, has proved herself to be quite the talented actress in the recent years with films such as 'Winter's Bone' and this little movie called 'The Hunger Games' and here she continues on this winning streak. She's really great as Tiffany, a young woman who bonds with Pat, able to relate to his mental illness. With his role as Pat's dad, Robert DeNiro delivers his finest performance since 'Casino' in 1995, while Jacki Weaver offers fine support as his Pat's mother and Chris Tucker lightens the already-bright mood as a friend of Pat's. 'Silver Linings Playbook' is no masterpiece, but it is still a thoroughly enjoyable film and at its best when Lawrence and Cooper are on screen together, especially coming to life in these moments, where I found myself properly caught up in the drama. Elevated by strong performances, it is never less than watchable and always quite likable.",7,0,0,17 February 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," No, just, no
","Recently, we've become accustomed to seeing two types of fantasy romps – the darker ones such as 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and the less- serious, genre-mashup, particularly Timur Bembakatov's 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'. Consequently, it's unsurprisingly that Hansel and Gretel would make it to the big-screen once more, however, with this film, they can't be said to fall into either category, but conversely, both. It's just unfortunate that the movie doesn't really work as either.Diluted down to its basics, the story is something that would intrinsically appeal to a younger audience, due to its fairytale roots, but here it has been given a more 'grown-up' treatment which means brash swearing, nudity and of course, violence. Subsequently, this graphic content is done in too childish a manner to make the film an 'adult' one. At the same time, it attempts to maintain a dark and grim atmosphere to possibly scare viewers, which fails, incidentally. Then, on top of this, there are scenes intended to be ones of genuine emotion to make you empathise with the characters and also scenes that strive to parody the fantasy genre. All of these elements are things that might just work together, but here feel rather disjointed. Also, it's been said that to properly make a parody of something you need to truly love it, but here, such scenes feel quite crass.I'm aware that this movie is not supposed to be a high-brow work of art, it's supposed to be a slice of enjoyable fantasy adventure, and don't get me wrong, I love a good fantasy romp as much as the next man (I even have a soft spot for 2004's 'Van Helsing') and often relish a nice dollop of violent (and somewhat silly) action, having thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's adaptation of '300'. Yet, I'd struggle to relate this film to being anything remotely close to enjoyable; I frequently tried to enjoy this movie, but couldn't find any cause to, with my interest consistently drifting off.The action scenes are remarkably unremarkable, with editing that mightn't be out of place in a Michael Bay actioner and overstuffed with flimsy CGI. The characters themselves are unengaging, with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arteton striding around with American accents that just confounded me, as other players such as Peter Stormare (who can do much better than this) have thick European accents. The creature make-up and design was nothing special and the ogre look unbelievably cheap. If you want to properly do fantasy creatures, just look at someone like Guillermo del Toro. But most significantly, the film was deathly dull, boring, and frankly, forgettable.",2,26,56,9 March 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A faithful, brutal and mesmerizing adaptation from David Fincher
","I am a fan of the Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy and the Swedish miniseries; finding the books to be emotional, suspenseful and engrossing, while finding the miniseries to be very entertaining and satisfying. However, unlike many people, I did not groan when it was announced that David Fincher would be re-adapting it the novel, but instead was intrigued to see where he would take the source material, considering his impressive background in the genre with Zodiac and the brilliant Seven. As the cast and crew came together, everyone seemed well-suited to the film; and while the film's production gathered pace, my anticipation was high. Fortunately my expectations were met.One aspect which struck me upon first viewing was the script's faithfulness to the novel, something which I particularly liked; and while I don't mind an adaptation occasionally straying from the source material (like the Oplev one, which I thoroughly enjoyed), this Dragon Tattoo retained some of my favourite things from the novel that were absent from the Swedish adaptation - such as Holger Palmgren's importance to Lisbeth, Pernilla Blomkvist, the Hedestad cat and that brilliant ending (Fincher beautifully realized this on screen to powerful effect) – for me, these faithful, but important inclusions helped the film feel truer to the overall tone of the novel. 'The adaptation Stieg Larsson would probably prefer', as one critic remarked.Having only seen Rooney Mara in The Social Network, I was curious to see how she would portray Lisbeth and after reading some early interviews, I didn't doubt her commitment, which I found blatantly apparent with her on screen transformation. I loved Noomi Rapace in the titular role, but I'm not here to compare the two. Mara's Lisbeth is a joy to watch, capturing the character perfectly and just how I envisioned her whilst reading the books; she is defensive, introverted and vulnerable with an undying magnetic presence. When Daniel Craig was cast as Mikael Blomkvist, a number of people were concerned that he may bring his 'James Bond' to the role; however this was, fortunately not the case, as he proves very likable and convincing as the journalist, and like Mara very true to Larsson's creation. Their scenes together are blissful; their lines bounce off each other, while their chemistry crackles like a roaring fire. I'd also like to favourably mention Steve Zallian's great screenplay, Jeff Cronenwerth's gorgeous cinematography (which depicts the frosty landscape wonderfully), the deservedly Oscar-winning editing from Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' brilliant score, which finds the duo composing a score even better than their Academy Award-winning work on Fincher's previous effort.One thing I want to make clear is that this is not a remake, nor was it ever; it's a re-adaptation, as pretentious as it sounds, that's what it is. Don't believe me? Well then, read the novel and watch both; and even if you prefer Niel Arden Oplev's, this Dragon Tattoo is still not a remake. This is an excellent David Fincher adaptation of a fantastic novel. It's dark, emotionally resonant, grisly, captivating and mature.",10,2,10,19 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A reboot elevated by great performances and strong direction
","Around two and a half years ago I heard the announcement of a Spiderman reboot; my initial reaction was less-than-enthusiastic - 'too soon...what's the point?', I thought; but after the disappointing mess that was Spiderman 3, I realised that maybe it might not be so bad after all. I found Marc Webb to an unusual but interesting choice, but aside from that, everything seemed to come together nicely for the film's production; the perfect casting and even my delightful joy at the faithful inclusion of Gwen Stacy and Peter's homemade web-shooters. However having thoroughly enjoyed the first of Raimi's and loved the sheer brilliance of the second, I still remained somewhat worried about how this early reboot would pan out. Thankfully, even if unnecessary (I suspect Sony just made it to keep the rights) it turned out better than expected.Much of the pure enjoyment of this film stems from the wonderful casting of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy respectively. Their scenes together are a particular pleasure to watch; their beautiful chemistry and the manner their lines spark off each other convey the awkwardness of youth to the effect where it left me smiling widely. They are undoubtedly the heart of the film; its beating centre which provides the film with life and emotion. They charm, we root. After being so great in Never Let Me Go and The Social Network, Garfield does not disappoint; doing a wonderful job of making the dual role his own, proving that he is indeed one of the most capable and talented actors under 30 today. Stone continues to impress after a line of great performances, working marvellously alongside Garfield. A scene between her and Dennis Leary concerning cocoa (really) provides one of the film's best comic beats. It is thanks to these performances that nothing in the film feels forced or out-of- character.It's pretty much a fact that Spiderman has a poor back catalogue when it comes to villainy; and when the lizard was first announced as the chief antagonist, I felt he'd be at odds with the film's promised 'realism' and even feared he may turn out worse than the Power Rangers reject that was the Green Goblin in Raimi's first, yet Rhys Ifans, oddly refusing to betray his Welsh accent, delivers a strong performance as Curt Connors, if not the Lizard. He proves to be quite likable for the film's first half, and even though the seeds of tragedy are there for his metamorphosis, his inevitable transformation was somewhat rushed, which never allows them come to poignant fruition. The Lizard does indeed look ridiculous and it almost, but doesn't quite work.'The untold story', the publicity proclaimed; maybe next time, fellas, because of course, they are similarities to Raimi's first chapter; the basics are all there - high school, love interest, Flash, Uncle Ben, the cheap mask, etc. But thanks to assured direction and brilliant casting (Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben!), it somehow manages to be exciting and emotional, even if not entirely new. James Horner's score was nowhere near as memorable as Elfman's though.This is a superhero film slightly odd in the fact that it is just as good at portraying human relationships than sweeping set-pieces, not that the action is inherently bad, it is mildly enjoyable, but some of the tender character moments are the film's true highlights, elevating it wonderfully. I was genuinely surprised by the fact that I liked it; it was a fairly enjoyable comic book film with strong emotional resonance. Yet, while easily better than Spiderman 3, and even better than the first, Spiderman 2 is still the amazing Spiderman.",7,2,6,9 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Not a masterpiece, but still a great return to Middle-Earth
","*I must add that I did not see the film in 3D or HFR, only the normal 2D 24fps*With 'the Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Peter Jackson crafted something truly special; by adapting what many considered to be the most unfilmable fantasy novel ever, he presented us with something the like of which has never been seen before. The three films were one sweeping epic of spectacle, brilliance and emotion. So after $2.82 billion in box-office gross and 17 (wholly deserved) Academy Awards, the Kiwi director has returned to Middle-Earth with 'An Unexpected Journey', the first instalment of his Hobbit trilogy. 'But should it have really been a trilogy?' has been the question on the lips of many, with numerous reviewers criticizing the film's 169-minute runtime, labelling sections of the film, in particular the opening 45 minutes as 'turgid' and dismissing it as nothing more than a self- indulgent money-making exercise. When the final instalment 'There and Back Again' is released, time will tell, but for the most part of 'Unexpected Journey' it never really feels as if Jackson is desperately taking out the rolling pin and clutching onto every last comma of the source material.It opens with not one, but two prologues; the former of which is concerned with an attack on the Dwarven kingdom of Erebor, where we are introduced to two important players, Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Smaug the dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). The second prologue transports us to a more familiar setting: Bag End, where we see Bilbo Baggins (played by the reliable Ian Holm for this scene) and Frodo (Elijah Wood) preparing for Bilbo's 111th birthday, tying in quite nicely with 'Fellowship'. This leads into the main story, as we meet a younger Bilbo (Martin Freeman) being met by a wizard calling himself 'Gandalf the Grey' (Ian McKellan), who tricks the home- loving Hobbit into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of 12 Dwarfs, which doubles as Bilbo's recruitment as their 'burglar' to help them steal their treasure back from Smaug. After 20 minutes of banter, singsongs, doilies and James Nesbitt's god-awful hat, Bilbo reluctantly joins the group and the adventure begins...Martin Freeman is wonderful as the eponymous character, offering a nice contrast to the gloomy and weight-of-the-world- on-my-shoulders-isms of Frodo. He is instantly charming and likable, longing for 'tea' and his 'books' over Orcs and Wargs. His best moment is possibly the 'Riddles in the Dark' scene where he encounters Gollum (Andy Serkis) and combines his wit and cleverness with genuine fear; Serkis is also extraordinary in his single scene, but really, what else would you expect? Ian McKellan is also great as Gandalf, sharing some lovely moments with Bilbo and once he steps back on screen, it feels like we never left Middle-Earth at all. The Dwarfs are, despite a lengthy runtime, somewhat of a muddle and only a handful properly stand out – Kili (Aidan Turner filling the Legolas role of a handsome archer), Balin (Ken Stott providing a voice of reason), Stephen Hunter as Bombur (essentially the portly comic relief), James Nesbitt's Bofur (thanks to that hat) and of course, Thorin Oakenshield, a role in which Armitage channels Aragorn, a link strengthened by the 'king without a kingdom' side to his character.Unsurprisingly, the film looks truly beautiful; whether it's the familiar sight of the Shire of the Misty Mountains, it is undeniable that Jackson and his longtime DoP Andrew Lesnie have an uncanny eye for capturing the magnificent beauty that New Zealand has to offer. A number of shots of the group trekking across vast landscapes (shocking, I know) exemplify this, in particular a Warg chase set upon expansive open fields and a snow-covered mountain range- set moment. This complemented by a fantastic score by Howard Shore; he and Jackson fell out on 'King Kong' due to 'creative differences' and as a result, did not work of that film or Jackson's following project 'The Lovely Bones'. Thankfully however, they have reunited for 'The Hobbit', with the Canadian composer delivering a great score that blends 'Lord of the Rings' motifs with new musical cues. The way that the melody of the Dwarfs' Misty Mountains song was used as the movie's main theme was a lovely touch. The film is far from perfect though; it's over reliance on CGI robbed some moments of a sense of physicality, as a character such as Azog, the chief Orc, would have been portrayed as a man in prosthetics in the Rings trilogy, but here he is unfortunately a fully CG character, which got me longing for the days of Lawrence Makoare. Sylvester McCoy's wizard Radagast the Brown verges on Jar Jar Binks territory especially with that bunny-led sleigh, but thankfully he doesn't outstay his welcome. There are also a handful of moments where the pacing dips slightly, fortunately not to an extreme capable of scuppering the film. Its runtime may also test the patience of newcomers looking for fast- paced fantasy romp.'An Unexpected Journey' is a great start to the 'the Hobbit' series. Is it as good as its predecessors? No, that would be a near-impossible feat. But is it still an excellent film? Absolutely. As longtime Middle- Earth fan, I can safely say that this movie exceeded my expectations, as following all the negative feedback from many professional critics, I went in expecting something worse. It is visually gorgeous, exciting, and moving with a huge strength in the form of Martin Freeman's Bilbo. With Mirkwood, the Battle of the Five Armies and Smaug all to come over the next two films, it can only get better, and if it does, then my, what a trilogy we'll have on our hands.",7,2,11,20 December 2012
Django Unchained," A stunning return to form
","It's fair to say that unlike his main character, Quentin Tarantino was never really a director who was chained to begin with; i.e. he is characteristically a filmmaker who has always played by his own rules. This trademark is something that hasn't worked in his favour every time; his inherent fanboyism, passion for exploitation cinema and auteur style was something that came to bear (and not for the better) in his half of 2007's 'Grindhouse', 'Death Proof', an exercise in self-indulgence that is easily the worst film he's directed. But we cannot forget that he has delivered three slices of brilliance – 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and the often-overlooked 'Jackie Brown'; a trio of movies that exemplify the talent he possesses. However, talented director doesn't always equal great film and Mr. Tarantino is now exception to this, as following the rather good 'Kill Bill Vol One', he made the decidedly 'meh' follow-up, the frankly bad 'Death Proof' and the just alright 'Inglourious Basterds', which may have been poor as its predecessor had it not been for Christoph Waltz and those two scenes. Which then brings us swiftly along to his eighth film, 'Django Unchained'.In the opening titles sequence we are introduced to a number of black slaves being dragged across expansive landscapes, in the antebellum year of 1858. In their company is Django (Jamie Foxx), who is freed by Dr. Schultz, a bounty hunter under the guise of travelling dentist (Christoph Waltz). Django's main concern is to be reunited with his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who was taken from him and sold to a plantation. Schultz then agrees that if the newly-free slave helps him to locate the nefarious Brittle Brothers, he'll aid him in his search for his wife.I'm certain there's a good chance you've heard of the controversy this movie is generating, primarily due to its frequent use of the N-word, with numerous people accusing it of racism. I can't say this was a problem for me; it never once felt as if that certain word was being over-used, but conversely felt natural, like an integral part of the era the film was portraying, i.e. there is cause for it. Even though 'Django' possesses a comedic spirit and an effectively brutal Mandingo fight, there is no question how seriously it takes slavery. In terms of its depiction of slavery, it is neither too nice nor 'Addio Zio Tom', in that it doesn't schmaltz things up but at the same time retains a level of maturity in approaching the subject. It's a tricky subject to get right on screen, but thankfully, Tarantino doesn't approach it with the same attitude he did the Nazis in 'Basterds' and instead offers an occasionally powerful look at the topic that never borders into overly- gratuitous territory. At the heart of the movie lies something that Tarantino hasn't really explored before: a love story. One of the most brilliant things about this film is that Django isn't a man trying to bring an end to slavery; he simply wants to find his wife and live happily with her. His love for Broomhilda is his only driving force over the course the relatively lengthy runtime. It's a surprisingly touching love story that helps the viewer engage in the story and root for Django as he embarks on his journey to rescue her from 'the dragon'.Much of the reason this works is due to a strong Jamie Foxx; he inhabits the screen with a great sense of presence and easily manages to make his character a likable and charismatic force on the screen. With the eventual casting of Hans Landa (coincidentally, the role was originally scheduled for Leonardo DiCaprio), Tarantino spotted a brilliant acting talent in the form of Christoph Waltz. His performance in that film was the best thing about it and here, he's just as good. In contrast to the villainous Landa, Schultz is a delight to watch and induces the movie with a real sense of warmth and humanity, forming a great double-act with Foxx. Then there's DiCaprio; after an absence from cinema screens since Christopher Nolan's 'Inception', he has returned to the movies with an absolutely fantastic performance as Calvin Candie, the owner of the plantation where Django's wife resides. Similar to Waltz, it feels like he's having the time of his life. He is electrifying as the slave owner with his awful teeth (one of the film's many inspired touches), particularly in the dinner-table sequence – a scene every bit as good (and tense) as those two lengthy scenes of dialogue in Tarantino's previous film. But the most impressive performance is possibly Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's slave and servant, Stephen; a character who is essentially the ultimate Uncle Tom. A truly nasty creation, he's encumbered with severe loyalty to his master and is disgusted by Django and how he's allowed 'into the big house', frequently dropping the N-bomb when referring to him. Jackson is a deeply chilling and equally magnetic presence on screen, in the first role I've ever witnessed him lose himself entirely in. 'Django Unchained' could be considered a long film, clocking in at 165 minutes, yet it never feels boring and zips along at a rollicking pace, hopping from one great scene to another in captivating motion. It's also aided by Robert Richardson's consistently beautiful cinematography, a great soundtrack and a number of touches of pure directorial genius, such as the blood drops splashing on the flowers. It's not perfect, Kerry Washington is competent in her performance but is somewhat wasted and Tarantino's cameo as an Australian plantation owner is terrible. But these slip-ups do little to damage this wonderful movie overall. This is an audacious and brutal piece of filmmaking that may well be Tarantino's best film since 'Pulp Fiction', let alone 'Jackie Brown'. He probably thinks it's a masterpiece and in this instance, I'm tempted to agree. In other words, I loved it.",10,0,2,26 January 2013
Drive," A modern classic
","This review has taken me a long time to think out, and even so I don't think I'll be able to do it justice, but here goes.Since Drive has been premièred at Cannes over a year ago it has been heaped with undying praise; during that première, it received cheering and afterwards, a ten-minute and rapturous standing ovation. Then came the reviews upon release: unanimous praise; I was hooked when a few critics compared it to The Driver and (the brilliant) Vanishing Point. Even my favourite critics - Roger Ebert, Mark Kermode and Philip Molloy - all sung its praises. Notably most critics spoke of its influences - John Hughes, Walter Hill, Gaspar Noe, Michael Mann, Alejandro Jodorowsky and even Risky Business. Influences, which if you have no knowledge of or appreciation for you may not 'get' the film. Because, make no mistake, this is a film which embraces cinematic nostalgia to its brilliant benefit; something Refn's fifth film, Bronson, also wonderfully utilized.Then there's that cast; not just the obvious star, Refn has a truly impeccable troupe of actors before us. Gosling is truly a marvel in it, making the difficult role of 'the mysterious man' magnetic, mesmerizing and utterly convincing. For me, his performance evoked memories of Clint Eastwood's The Man with No Name or Alain Delon's protagonist in the classic Le Samourai. Carey Mulligan is reliably great, perfectly portraying the love caught betwixt two men; Bryan Cranston is fantastic (what else would you expect from the best actor on TV?) in a small, but vitally significant role; Ron Perlman is predictably a joy to watch as the 'Jew running a pizzeria'; even those with less screen time, Oscar Isaac and Christina Hendricks still manage to impress and make a strong impression on the viewer. Even Kaden Leos is good as the young son, Benicio. But then there's Mr. Albert Brooks - an undeniably brilliant performance. All the more impressive when you take into account his largely comedic background ('A psychotic Woody Allen', as Refn remarked). He is sinister, dangerous and fully-fledged; deserving of all the praise and awards he picked up.Newton Thomas Siegel's cinematography is a thing to behold; beautiful, enticing and authentic; which I found somewhat reminiscent of Paul Thomas Anderson's favoured use of grounded and firm shots or Peter Suschitzky's cinematography in Cronenberg's Crash. The pacing also, is a wonder; it is slow, yet hypnotic, and even as things intensify in the latter half, nothing feels out of character, thanks to the brilliance and naturalness of the pacing.Then we have the euphoric 80s tinge: the ultra-cool music stylishness of Cliff Martinez, Desire, College, etc; the clothes, especially that now-iconic satin jacket; or even the architecture, which was actually cheap stucco and mirrored glass, carefully edited to leave out more contemporary buildings. Refn has stated that the chaste romance at the heart of the story was partially inspired by the films of John Hughes, which is beautifully and aesthetically evident, to the effect where it is one of the most nuanced, convincing and human love stories I've witnessed on screen. This love also marvellously plays out in one of the most tender, brutal and flawless sequences I've ever seen on screen.This film blew me away, I hadn't seen a new film that impressive since Inception. It really is a modern classic as many of the critics hailed it, anchored not only by Gosling, but by Refn's impeccable and incredible direction. I eagerly anticipate Only God Forgives.",10,3,7,3 July 2012
Lincoln," Spielberg and Day-Lewis team up to deliver a potential classic
","Historical biopics such as this can often fall victim to feeling somewhat like a monument, where the viewer is acutely aware that they are watching a big important film about a big important person. This can cause the audience to possess a sense of admiration towards the film, yet retain a distance as they would a monument. Oliver Stone is a director who has become known for making historical biopics that never fail to herald their importance, yet this is something which has not always worked in his favour, as some of his more recent work has shown. Thankfully, it is safe to say that, despite occasionally feeling like a monument of significance, 'Lincoln' largely avoids this, presenting an engrossing and often personal portrait of a man who's frequently viewed in a larger-than-life manner.Steven Spielberg is a man no stranger to the biopic, having made films such as the multiple Oscar-winning 'Schindler's List' or 2002's 'Catch Me If You Can'. He's also well-accustomed to delivering his fair share of historical drama – 'Amistad' (which also dealt with slavery), 'Empire of the Sun' and of course, 'Saving Private Ryan'. One common thread throughout all these movies and more of his was that they were unmistakably the work of Spielberg and when it came to 'Lincoln', this was a slight cause of worry for me. I'd enjoyed most of Spielberg's work, but for this film I felt that heartstrings being pulled at every opportunity and sweeping, rousing scenes in abundance would have been too obvious a direction to steer it in. The trailer didn't help; it made it look like 'Glory' with its dollop of sentimentality and glimpses of epic battles. This turned out to be a complete misrepresentation of the film itself, as with 'Lincoln', Spielberg has made what is quite possibly his most uncharacteristic movie yet; yes, some of the trademarks are still there, but not as much as they could have been, had he wished. It is a very interior film; the Gettysburg battle scene depicted in the misleading trailer occurs within the first five minutes and aside from the occasional exterior shot, 'Lincoln' stays indoors for the majority of its 150 minutes. Those expecting a stirring and epic biopic will be sorely disappointed and possibly bored; we get nothing of his poor childhood in Kentucky or his rise to greatness; hell, we don't even hear him deliver the Gettysburg Address. However these are not complaints, as this film is primarily concerned with politics and history. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's 'Team of Rivals: the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, it's largely set during the last four months of the 16th President's life, centring on his efforts to get the Thirteenth Amendment in the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives, thus ending the war that was raging throughout the country and subsequently abolishing slavery. This means there is a large number of in-depth political discussions and debates that always demand every bit of your attention. If you have no interest in history or politics whatsoever, there is a considerable chance that 'Lincoln' may indeed disinterest you. With the presence of Tony Kushner, some critics have dubbed it 'The West Wing' with beards and they're not far off.The film looks as if thought has been put into every frame; Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is consistently beautiful and has a richness and texture to it that makes every frame a delight. Each shot also appears as if it was pondered over and is all the better for it. The camera-work in 'Lincoln' is relatively restrained, but additionally it is visually lyrical possessing a lovely fluidity, coming to life even in the finer moments, such as the sight of cigar smoke wafting through the darkened rooms. Given that Day-Lewis is involved as well as Spielberg, it's unsurprising that 'Lincoln' exemplifies the very definition of what it means to give attention to detail, bringing a huge sense of depth to the film. This concentration on details was so strong that the ticking of Lincoln's watch was rendered by recording his actual watch, which is housed in the Lincoln Presidential Library, in Springfield, Illinois.There's no denying that Daniel Day-Lewis is an extraordinary and versatile actor, having proved himself to be such in works like 'The Age of Innocence', 'The Last of the Mohicans' and Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece 'There Will Be Blood'. After Liam Neeson left the long- mooted project, Leonardo DiCaprio convinced Day-Lewis to take the role and what a magnificent performance he has delivered. His slightly twisted physicality and croaky voice may take some adjusting to, yet vitally you never doubt for a second that you are watching Abraham Lincoln, instead of a performer. He is an enigmatic and endlessly engaging presence on screen. It is a truly impeccable troupe of actors that Spielberg has so expertly assembled. There's Sally Field's great support as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee-Jones' brilliance as the fervent Thaddeus Stevens, the sneaky operative trio of John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson and a delightfully-moustachioed James Spader, David Strathairn's reliable impressiveness as William H. Seward, Lincoln's right-hand man, Lee Pace's rivetingly fiery performance as Republican Fernando Wood, and the list goes on.For better or for worse, Steven Spielberg is a filmmaker known to schmaltz thins up and when it came to 'Lincoln' he had an ample opportunity to do this, but aside from the final five minutes, he doesn't and delivers something that is much more than men with whiskers discussing politics in darkly-lit rooms. It is an intelligent, personal and surprisingly thrilling piece of work that is his finest film since 'Saving Private Ryan'.",8,0,2,17 February 2013
Prisoners," A sombre and slow, but excellent piece of work
","Some films create a brilliant sense of atmosphere. 'Prisoners' is one of those films. From the moment it opens, we are greeted with an ice cold atmosphere that continues until the end, reflecting the chilly weather that pervades through the suburban Pennsylvania setting. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography really helps in crafting this atmosphere, as like the film, it moves at a slow and often languorous pace, occasionally honing in on things that don't necessarily move the plot forward, but add to the mood. Coupled with the superb score by Jóhann Jóhannsson, a feeling of dread is created from the beginning, lingering over ever frame right up until the credits roll.This dark and chilly atmosphere suits the plot of 'Prisoners' perfectly. During a Thanksgiving gathering involving two families, each one's youngest daughter mysteriously vanishes, nowhere to seen, leaving fathers Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and God-fearing, American survivalist Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) deeply concerned over the fate of their kids. Loner Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes on the case and soon arrests Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a guy 'with the IQ of 10 year- old', but struggles to find any evidence against him. However, it's not long before a furious Keller takes matters into his own hands. Jackman has always been a good actor, despite sometimes being considered to be just a 'movie star', and with this film he gives what is very possibly his best performance to date. He's a magnetic force whenever on screen and is perfectly credible as a devastated father. Another person who is entirely credible in their role is Gyllenhaal. It may be as a result of starring in David Ayer's excellent 'End of Watch', but Gyllenhaal is terrific as Detective Loki, offering a great contrast to the fiery Jackman. He even goes so far as adding an actor's tick, as Loki frequently blinks, signalling his stress and anxiety. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are rounded off by a good supporting cast of Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano at his creepiest.At 153 minutes, you could argue that 'Prisoners' is overlong, but its length was one of the best things about it for me, as I became absorbed in the drama. This is a slow film with slow passages; it definitely takes its time getting places, but with such a great sense of atmosphere, length is hardly an issue. This is more than simply a 'kidnap movie' as director Denis Villeneuve attempts to make a serious point about kidnapping, questioning the value of information obtained under duress and the idea of doing things with the right intentions even if it's against the law. Similarly, the characters exist in an area of gray morality, as evidenced by the fact that I sympathized with Keller and Alex. Sure, it's not perfect – the end twist feels somewhat generic, consequently jarring with the non-generic approach to the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this is a grimly-atmospheric, well-acted and excellently structured piece of work that has something intelligent to say to say about its subject matter.",8,2,4,15 October 2013
Elysium," Solid, but disappointing
","'District 9' was a brilliant directorial debut and also a true sleeper hit. It didn't feature any stars (or recognisable faces), was directed by a first-timer and was set in South Africa (an unusual location for a sci-fi movie), featuring some of the ugliest aliens for some time. However, it was a box-office hit, managing to recuperate its budget over six times and garnered critical acclaim, eventually (and deservedly) scoping an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (another unusual thing for a sci-fi film). Thus, Neill Blomkamp's follow-up attracted great interest, especially since being another gritty work of science fiction and featuring Sharlto Copley, who was so great as Wikus in 'District 9'. Sadly, 'Elysium' is no 'District 9'.The premise sounded very promising. In 2154, the Earth has become over- populated and over-polluted, with the poor residing there in slums while the wealthy have moved to an elaborate space station called Elysium in order to preserve their way of life. Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con who is now a factory line worker; unfortunately, he becomes fatally exposed to radiation and is given five days left to live. As a result, he decides to do all in his power to get up to Elysium even if that means melding his body with a mechanical exoskeleton. As Max, the reliable Matt Damon is quite good, making the down-on-his-luck hero a likable lead. However, it is Sharlto Copley who steals the show, portraying a character that is a world away from Wikus, clearly revelling in the nastiness of Agent Kruger, who despite being a one-dimensional villain, is a magnetic presence whenever on screen. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, delivers a wooden performance with a bizarre and stilted accent.Like 'District 9', this movie is home to some brilliant design work, the decaying Earth is beautifully ugly and the CGI robots slot seamlessly into the world. Some of the action sequences are good, especially the first one after Max puts on the exoskeleton, but the flat third act becomes focused on generic action and good-guy-punch-bad-guy. This action-heavy finale wouldn't feel sterile if it wasn't for the touches of greatness present within the first act, where everything is expertly set-up. However, 'Elysium' only has touches of greatness and that doesn't equal a great movie especially with a heavy-handed and clunky political message. That isn't to say that it is a bad film – it's not – it's alright, but nothing more.",4,0,1,29 August 2013
The Artist," A classic of warmth, wit and charm
","'The Artist' is a sheer joy to witness from beginning to end. Why? Well, because it feels like such a breath of fresh air. In recent years, we have become accustomed to overblown CGI-fests, increasingly unfunny comedies and irritatingly saccharine melodramas. Then, out of nowhere along comes Michael Hazavanicius with a silent film shot entirely in black and white letterbox 4x3. To everyone's surprise it became an unprecedented hit both in terms of box office and critically, eventually garnering seven BAFTAs, three golden Globes and seven Academy Awards, winning Best Picture in the case of each, becoming the first silent movie to win the Best Picture Oscar since 'Wings' and 'Sunrise' both did so at the very first Academy Awards and the first black and white film to win since Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', in 1993.Sharing similarities with the brilliant 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'A Star is Born', the film centres on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) a silent film star much-loved audiences. His fame is soon scuppered, when, in 1927 silent cinema is replaced the 'talkies'. Despite this, George decides to continue with what he does best, whilst Peppy Miller (a radiant Bérénice Bejo) a young actress rises to fame as the 'talkies' continue to rise in popularity.Akin to Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo', this film is clearly in love with early cinema, however unlike that film, Michael Hazavanicius populates 'The Artist' with irresistibly charming characters, and yes, that includes Uggie's enthralling turn as Jack. From the moment it begins to its wonderful finale, the movie's heart never stops beating. Its deep love for silent movies reverberates off the screen, helping to transport us back to an earlier time, immersing the viewer in the story.It is also propelled by its two main players, Dujardin and Bejo. He gives George the movie star charisma with one gleaming smile, not entirely dissimilar to sleek good-looks of Gene Kelly. Even in his quieter and most thoughtful moments, the brilliance of his performance never falters, applying the character with depth and ripe emotion, despite the seldom appearance of title cards. Despite being a relative newcomer (she also appeared Hazavanicius 2006 spy-parody 'OSS 117: Cairo Nest of Spies'), Bejo manages to epitomize the kind of female film star that was so popular; she is positively gorgeous and captivating to watch, enjoying some great scenes with Dujardin. A third-act dance number between the two is a pure delight to witness. There are also appearances from more-familiar faces throughout, such as Malcolm McDowell, John Goodman and James Cromwell. Also worth a mention is Uggie who plays Valentin's dog Jack, offering some of the film's most amusing comic beats.But this is more than just a love letter to silent cinema, because when you put aside all its old-fashioned filming techniques, this is an emotional film about love and loss, something our leading man has to grapple with over the course of its narrative. However, this is not some kind of dour drama, but the sort of film that leaves you smiling from ear-to-ear by the time the credits roll. It was so uplifting in fact, that during the closing scene, I found it difficult to remain seated the joy was so much. What a wonderful film 'The Artist' is. It is truly magical; a cinema lover's dream and also a fantastically enjoyable film for more casual viewers. I absolutely adore this film.",9,3,5,4 January 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A stupidly entertaining finale to an entertainingly stupid series
","What can I say that hasn't been said already? A plot synopsis or any background information is practically redundant because I imagine that if you're reading this (not very good) review, you already know the setup.'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part Two '(that title's not clumsy at all) is my first Twilight-related experience since the Chris Weitz- directed 'New Moon', I must say however, I'm not one of these people who passionately despises the series, nor am I someone who lives for it, i.e. a 'twi-hard'; honestly, I'm somewhat passive about the series. I kind of enjoyed the first two installments, finding the shoddy visual effects, cheesy dialogue, often flat performances and ludicrousness to be consistently entertaining.It's worth noting that (in a manner somewhat similar to the Harry Potter films) the cast have eased into their roles and appear more comfortable in them than ever before. At the same time though, the trademarks of the series are still present - the lingering and forlorn frowns, the lip- biting and Taylor Lautner's way of saying 'Bella' when he gets 'emotional'. Also worth a mention is Michael Sheen's performance as Aro; exactly what the franchise needs, he's ridiculously camp and OTT, which is displayed delightfully in a moment of maniacal laughter that wouldn't have been out of place in an episode of Adam West's Batman. It was similarly nice to see Lee Pace, a personal favourite of mine, get some screen time.Out of all the Twilight films I've seen thus far, I found this to be the most solidly enjoyable, offering a number of scenes where it embraced its inherent absurdity. These included (but was not limited to) Bella wrestling a mountain lion, the creepy relationship between Jacob and borderline MacGuffin child Renesmee, and Bella beating the crap out of Jacob. There were also moments where I wondered if it was consciously laughing at itself - Jacob's 'should I start calling you Dad?' remark to Edward and dad Charlie's confusion at his granddaughter's name. Interestingly though, the CGI incarnation of baby Renesmee resembled some sort of demon-child that you'd find in a 70s horror film. A final act showdown showcases the best action and effects displayed throughout the series, unfortunately and frustratingly, it is robbed of its entertainment factor following a cheap twist. In the end, all it really amounts to is 'creepy soapy claptrap', as Danny Leigh remarked, but let's not forget that there is indeed a place for 'creepy soapy claptrap'.",6,1,2,14 December 2012
Les Misérables," 'Can you hear the people sing?' Oh yes.
","Despite being proclaimed in every interview surrounding this film to be something brand new, singing live in a movie musical isn't; it's been done before on films such 'At Long Last Love', 'The Fantasticks' and 'Across the Universe'. However, it's worth noting that it has never been carried out on such a scale, with the film all- sung over the course of its relatively lengthy runtime. That means that there is no dialogue (only the occasional one line) and what we get instead is conversations being sung, 'My name is Jean Valjean', sings an impressive Hugh Jackman, 'and I'm Javert!', replies a strong Russell Crowe. This approach takes some adjusting to; it was about ten minutes before I got into the rhythm of it. Tom Hooper should be commended for making the decision to have his cast sing live, even if it's not a new phenomenon, mainly because it lends itself to the story and world of the film brilliantly. You can feel the songs erupting from the actors' chests, see their veins popping and sense the sheer effort they all put into it; yes, even Russell Crowe.It is a film with a fantastic sense of physicality. When we see the prisoners pull the huge ship into the yard, you feel the ropes they hold firmly in their grasp and get a full sense of the gargantuan ship slowly lurching forward. The sound design helps with this; as the uprising occurs in the film's third act and many a musket is fired, you hear each shot at such a volume that it appears as if the characters are standing at your side. Too many movie musicals have an unfortunate stagey-feel (some purposely, e.g. Baz Luhrmann's brilliant 'Moulin Rouge') so it was deeply refreshing to see one with an unmistakable sense of space. Much of this is down to Tom Hooper's great direction. He is fully aware that the stage primarily consists of mid-shots because of your distance from the stage, so he does everything you can't onstage, with the film's camera-work mainly relying on facial close- ups and sweeping wide shots. The former is particularly effectively in conveying the raw emotion brimming from the actors, while the latter works in giving the movie a wonderfully epic quality, especially in the Paris exterior scenes (the Elephant of Bastille!) and that stunning opening, where the camera glides in over the sea, climbing over the ship to reveal Hugh Jackman and his fellow convicts pulling it forward with as much force as they can muster. Hooper is aided by impressive lensing from DoP Danny Cohen and production designer Eve Stewart (both of whom collaborated with Hooper on 'The King's Speech') who offers a marvellous recreation of 19th Century France; sure it may be stylised, but it works to great effect in the context of the film.Then there's the actors. I'm sure you've heard of the praise surrounding Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine and how it will win her her first Academy Award. Frankly, I'd be shocked if it doesn't. Her twenty minutes on screen are a revelation to watch and should silence any naysayers who've dismissed her as being 'incapable of serious work'. Her heartbreaking delivery of 'I Dreamed a Dream' is the kind of showstopping moment that only comes along once in a while and that alone will win her the Oscar and probably the BAFTA; she's already won the Golden Globe (and deservedly at that). Then there's Hugh Jackman; great as always, he's no stranger to musicals, having impressed in a stage production of 'Oklahoma!' amongst others and appears very comfortable when belting out a few numbers. His performance is truly great and quite possibly his best yet, rivalling his similarly vein-popping work in Darren Aronofsky's criminally misjudged 'The Fountain'. Russell Crowe has garnered a lot of criticism for lack of vocal range, and while it's true that his voice is not up-to-the-standard of say, Jackman, (he occasionally slips into the rock stylings he used on 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and The Ordinary Fear of God ) , he makes up for it with his powerful presence and undeniable acting ability. Samantha Barks, having previously played Éponine onstage, is a joy to watch, delivering a great performance that simmers with broken-hearted emotion. Eddie Redmayne also impresses, rounding off a strong cast.The movie has its faults however. The pacing occasionally dips and in a handful of moments, drags slightly. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter lighten the dour mood as the Thénardiers, yet simultaneously feel as if they've stumbled in from another film, because their OTT appearance and 'comedy' jars with the film's tone and realism. Amanda Seyfried meanwhile, is the only weak link in the cast; her blandness does little to help her character's inherent drippyness, while her vocals regularly stray into an irritating shrill that reverberates like a singing Disney bird being shaken about, contrasting with the vocals of literally everyone else, and no, not for the better. Thankfully, the superb Barks and Redmayne (just about) save the love triangle from awfulness it could have fallen victim to otherwise.This is big and bold filmmaking at the hands of an excellent director who still allows the occasional experimental flourish (e.g. oddly tilted camera angles) to see the light of day, even in a film of this size. Sure, it is bombastic and straight-faced, but it's also one great big emotional experience. It's probably the best musical I've seen since the aforementioned 'Moulin Rouge'. You had me at 'a loaf of bread', Mr. Jackman.",8,0,1,16 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Absolutely brilliant
","Films like this can be a tricky thing to nail; portray events in too gung-ho a manner, you run the risk of being accused of over-patriotism, conversely, if you depict things in an opposing light, you could be criticised of condemnation. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a film which walks a narrow tightrope, but manages to do so with expertise so well-handled that it appears effortless. Similarly the film never feels like a documentary, an impressive feat considering that it could easily become a wearying succession of facts. One of the best things about it is that personalises the hunt for bin Laden by focusing on the central character of Maya, played by Jessica Chastain and makes her pursuit to find him an intense and gripping obsession. We first meet Maya in 2003, in a 'black site' as she watches fellow CIA officer Dan (Jason Clarke) interrogate a detainee over suspicion that he has links to Saudi terrorists. As he subjects the prisoner to waterboarding and tortuous humiliation, we see Maya flinch in the corner at the very sight of it, but by the time the credits roll she is a completely different character. 'History's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' as the poster put, changes her deeply, as she goes from being a young woman uncertain how to act in the situation she's landed in to being a strong-willed officer passionately and unhealthily driven by her desire to find this man. Significantly, she is not your conventional movie heroine; there is no speech concerned with fighting for your country and little backstory to suggest she has a personal connection to 9/11 or the terrorist attacks, a la the death of a loved one, all we get is 'a lot of my friends have died for this; I believe I was spared to finish the job.' The cloaked-in-secrecy stance with which director Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal approach the film's characters works in its favour, helping to firmly ground them in reality.The first act or so of 'Zero Dark Thirty' is rather murky and unclear; people talk about other people who may or may not have information concerning the matters at hand. Yet, this was probably a conscious decision because as the story develops, it becomes increasingly clearer and more focused as it hurtles towards a quite literally breathtaking finale. Bigelow is a filmmaker who has become renowned (and also dismissed by some female critics) for her skillful handle of action scenes and the eventual raid that unfolds in the film's final act is nothing short of incredible. It is a taut and properly white knuckle sequence that combines third-person combat with the first-person view from the infrared night vision; but don't think that it plays out like a video game, instead it feels brilliantly cinematic. However, the best thing about this climax (and possibly the entire film) is that you are always captivated, as one reviewer so rightly said: 'The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you gripped even when you already know the outcome.'This is aided by a consistently strong cast. Jessica Chastain who has had major roles in twelve films in the past two years, has delivered what I feel is her strongest performance yet. It is a superb piece of acting that is exemplified by her character's fascinating arc from idealism to cold emptiness. Chastain is notably supported by an impressive Jason Clarke, an actor with a great screen presence and a natural Jennifer Ehle as a fellow officer and friend of Maya's; while Mark Strong leaves a firm impact upon the viewer during his first scene where erupts in a CIA meeting.'Zero Dark Thirty' is not a warm film and this may prove problematic for some; it is cold and none of its characters could said to be likable, but despite the fact that you don't exactly for root for Maya, you are still engrossed in her journey. There are moments of character, but effectively reflecting its central figure, this is a film primarily concerned with one objective. The good guys aren't really 'good' in the truest sense; they're morally ambiguous people engaged in complicated and ultimately dirty work. And as for all the ongoing controversy surrounding, amongst other aspects, the torture scenes, I believe that the film takes neither a pro- nor an anti-torture stance, instead questioning the effectiveness of such an action.This film blew me away. I wasn't the biggest fan of 'The Hurt Locker', finding it to be quite good, but no masterwork. The same cannot be said for Bigelow's latest, as this an expertly orchestrated and incredibly tense piece of work that requires one hundred percent of your attention one hundred of the time and rewards you for doing so. Kathryn Bigelow, snubbed by the Academy this year, is one of the most talented directors around today and with 'Zero Dark Thirty' she has delivered an astounding, exceptional piece of cinema.",9,2,9,17 February 2013
There Will Be Blood," Filmmaking at its best.
","The opening 15 minutes of this film are a thing to behold; while we have no dialogue or exposition, it is the score by Jonny Greenwood which is most striking, with a dissonant, strained note that sets the tone for the remainder of the film (it is easily one of the best film scores of recent times). Along with Robert Elswit's sumptuous cinematography it conveys a mood of impending doom, as we witness Daniel Day-Lewis, entirely alone, at work in a barren landscape. The sound design as he breaks his leg or the sharp 'chink' of the axe is a perfect example of truly cinematic sound design. And that is precisely what this film is - truly cinematic; it is a film in the purest sense: on a visual level, a aural level and a visceral level. And for that it's mesmerizing.Yet upon my initial viewing the most impactful aspect was, of course, Day-Lewis' tour-de-force performance as Daniel Plainview; channelling Orson Welles and John Huston, he is just a revelation to watch, giving a towering and unrivalled piece of acting, that is just flat-out astonishing, grasping you by the scruff of the neck, to the point where you just cannot turn away from this flawless portrayal of a hideous monster, who is one of the most horrible, rapacious and power-obsessed characters to hit cinema screens this past decade. His genius just drips off the screen, as it conveys the proper skill of an unequalled actor, of someone who firmly took this role with a fierce determination, illustrated by the fact that even before he utters a word, we have grasped the depth of this character. His detractors will say his acting here is too histrionic or even ostentatious, but Day-Lewis is aware that Plainview is supposed to be showy, being a larger-than-life businessman with a ruthless drive for power, and because of that we are given a wonderfully bravura performance.The only other considerable role in the film is that of Paul Dano as Eli Sunday. While receiving much criticism for being nowhere near Day-Lewis' level of acting, this is undeserved as he is excellent in the supporting role he's given. And while he doesn't deliver the performance of his career, his turn as Sunday is very watchable and proves to be great foil to Day-Lewis with their brilliant scenes together. The remainder of the cast work as best they can with secondary roles, in what is essentially Day-Lewis' show, when it comes to the acting.Ever since he made considerable waves with 1997's Boogie Nights, Paul Thomas Anderson was always a name to watch, with many regarding him as one of the most interesting and best filmmakers of his generation, yet when this was released, he became lauded as 'THE filmmaker of his generation', and after my second viewing of There Will Be Blood, I came to agree with the statement wholeheartedly. Anderson is a auteur with encyclopedic knowledge of film and the technique. He gets it, basically, unlike say, Tommy Wiseau. He is a real master director, and this film exemplifies that, whether it's the breathtaking set-piece involving a derrick going up in flames, the opening or the THAT end sequence (which contains what is quite possibly the greatest piece of acting I've ever witnessed). Here we have a cinematic poet, defiantly refusing to work as part of a digitalised film business, by shooting on 35mm; which only strengthens the film's relationship with it's closest cousins: the old-school Hollywood epics.This is a stunning and sprawling work of intelligence, originality, ambition and blistering intensity; one of the few films I would call, without any hesitation, 'a masterpiece'. Easily the best film of the past decade, it's a mesmerizing, epic cinematic feat about greed, lies, religion, capitalism and insanity delivered by a magnificent director and the best actor working today.",10,4,6,17 August 2012
Prometheus," An impressive return to sci-fi for Mr. Scott
","I went into 'Prometheus' having seen 'Alien' twice and half of 'Aliens'. I had seen many of Scott's other films, and was eager to see how his return to the genre he shook up 33 years ago. The opening sequence is truly marvelous and grandiose, in contrast to 'Alien'. It must be noted that while Prometheus is set in the 'Alien' universe, it is an entirely different beast. 'Alien' was all about claustrophobia, verging on horror, whereas 'Prometheus' is a bigger film, with characters (sometimes overly, to clunky effect) discussing the bigger picture. 'Alien' had a subtle, minimal score, whereas this film presents us with a full-blown orchestra. Yet, despite the contrasts, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much of that was down to the performances of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. My first time to see Rapace, (watching the Millennium Trilogy this weekend), I was highly impressed; Fassbender ,naturally, was brilliant as David. A subtle, near flawless performance, which deserves all the praise it's getting. It is grisly and graphic, probably more than so than 'Alien', however in my opinion this manages to benefit the film, provoking a visceral reaction. Yes, there are questions left dangling, but isn't it better that a film leaves us pondering instead of spoon-feeding us the answers? One minor gripe I had with it was why Guy Pierce (in my opinion, a criminally underrated actor) played Peter Weyland, who had little screen-time. I imagine they could have got an actually elderly actor. But that can be ignored, as the film was great. I understand why many were disappointed, but thought it was excellent. It is serious sci-fi, in my opinion, the best type of sci-fi. I would prefer 'Prometheus' or 'Alien' over 'Star Wars' any day. All in all, this is a very enjoyable film and a very assured return to form for Ridley Scott which just about lives up to the hype.",5,3,13,16 June 2012
Taken 2," Liam Neeson's 2012 started off so well, but alas...
","Frankly, I feel that Taken should have remained in the straight-to-video dungeon where it belonged - even Neeson himself didn't expect a theatrical release - but it became a hit and the man who was once Oskar Schindler became a action hero. A sequel was inevitable, and well, here we are.While away in Istanbul, with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and teenage - yeah, right - daughter (Maggie Grace), Bryan Mills is targeted by a cabal of clichéd foreigners who want revenge for the deaths of their brothers and friends ('Ve will haf our rewenge!'), who Mills slaughtered 'like they ver so many nuthinks'. This time, him and his wife are kidnapped, and it's their daughter who must save them.Yes, I'm aware Taken was supposed to be stupid, OTT 'fun', but I found it dull and wasn't enthusiastic at the thought of a follow-up, and with this sequel new director Olivier Megaton delivers a film worse predecessor. Aside from Mr. Neeson, the film's main draw are the action sequences, here however, they might as well have been shot with potato. Whether a conscious decision or due to cuts to receive the mass audience- friendly 12A/PG-13, the action is sloppy and shoddily edited; each fight sees Neeson square off against some not-at-all stereotypical foes in a frenzy of shakycam, resulting in an incomprehensible flurry of fists and kicks. If it's a bid for a broader certificate, then it makes it seem as if he's censoring people to death, sending them to the cutting room floor, not the grave.The only thing that makes this thing bearable is of course, Liam Neeson, remaining an engaging presence in the midst of it all, delivering lines such as 'When a dog has a bone, the last thing you should do is take it from him', or possibly my favourite, 'Kim, I want you to remain calm, your mother and I have been... taken'. The fact he said such clunkers with a straight face gave me something to enjoy in an otherwise unexciting and turgid affair. There's one thing this film is sorely lacking and that's a sense of novelty and fun. C'mon Liam, you can do better.",3,0,0,18 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Smart. stunning and stirring; third time's the charm.
","After four years, here we are – the climax to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Yet, anticipation and expectation has never been higher, after Nolan set the bar so high with the trilogy's previous installment. One could even go so far to call him the victim of his success. Yet, nothing could prepare me for what lay ahead. The film opens, similarly to Knight, introducing us to the villain of this piece; for this we have Tom Hardy (easily one of the actors of his generation) as Bane. He has been understandably, but unfavourably compared to Heath Ledger's flawless Joker; they are two different actors playing completely different characters, so if Hardy's Bane 'isn't as enticingly charismatic as Ledger's Joker', I'm okay with that. His character is primarily conveyed through his hulking physique, that delightful voice and captivating eyes, which wonderfully convey emotion throughout; he is both an intellectual and physical equal for Bruce Wayne. Never has the possibility of death loomed so close on Bruce's horizon.And speaking of a certain Mr. Wayne, Bale delivers his best performance of the trilogy in this installment; his is respectably reserved, stalwart and soulful – entirely believable and endlessly engaging as the older, bruised and battered Bruce Wayne, who is now psychologically and physically frail. But when Batman does return, it's a blissfully euphoric moment of sheer elation. Bale is also supported by a brilliant supporting cast; consisting of reliably great returns: Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, who delivers some of the film's most touching moments; and impressive newcomers: Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway. Gordon-Levitt gives a strong and assured performance as the honest and likable cop John Blake, while Hathaway proves to be better than Michelle Pfeiffer who made such a mark on the role 20 years ago, and is superb in the part.From the beginning there is a strong sense that this will not end well, but despite the doom, the series has never been more entertaining or spectacular. From the stunning opening sequence to the magnificence of the Heinz Stadium scene or the fantastically choreographed and conceptualized fight between Bane and Batman half-way through; the scale is undeniably breathtaking and truly epic. In my opinion, much of this is due to Nolan's genius method of doing everything as practical as possible, with real extras (there are around 11,000 in the Stadium), explosions, stunts, etc. It pays off dividends and makes the action believable, exciting and exhilarating. Wally Pfister's marvellous cinematography also benefits the film to no end; Chris Nolan knows how to direct an action sequence and Wally Pfister knows how to shoot it. As far as I'm concerned, they're been the best D.O.P./Director duo of the millennium so far, if not my favourite ever. Nolan's rejection to rely on CGI and do everything for real gives the action an impactful physicality; in one particular scene, you can feel every single brutal blow.Unsurprisingly the film is both emotionally and intellectually resonant, with lives truly at stake and powerful speeches delivered; it also strongly plays off of A Tale of Two Cities throughout (it's made quite blatant in an emotional moment) to great effect , delivering a moral message about terrorism, class divisions and how you can eventually become what you oppose. It could be said to making a statement about capitalism and the financial elite during a stock market sequence coincidently shot as the Wall Street protests began. But maybe I'm reading too much into it, because make no mistake, the film doesn't forget to have fun; whether it's new toy 'the Bat' or a passing remark Bane makes about a child's vocal talents. It's this perfect balance between comic-book sensibilities and real-world groundings which makes these films so fantastic.Overall, this is a more-than-satisfying and trilogy-best conclusion to greatest comic book film series ever made. This is not just brilliant comic-book filmmaking, but also brilliant filmmaking in general. With Inception, Nolan confirmed his visionary genius, with The Dark Knight Rises, he has cemented it. To quote one of the cops in the film, 'Boy, you are in for a show tonight, son.'",8,7,16,7 August 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Thor-rific
","Marvel are everywhere at the moment. In the past two-and-a-half years we've had 'Thor', 'X-Men: First Class', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'The Avengers', 'The Amazing Spiderman', 'Iron Man 3', 'The Wolverine' and now, 'Thor: The Dark World'. There are also four more Marvel movies to follow next year – 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', 'The Amazing Spiderman 2', 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This could seem like overkill, except all of the aforementioned movies already released have been good and some great. Which now brings us to Thor's third big screen outing – how does it compare to slew of Marvel movies around today? Very favourably.Following the chaotic events that rocked New York in 'The Avengers', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are back in Asgard, with the latter being imprisoned for his crimes. The Nine Realms appear to be in order, but an ancient race is on a vengeful path – The Dark Elves, led by the villainous Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Upon discovering a portal between Asgard and Earth, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally reawakens them and they set their sights on Thor's homeworld.In stark contrasts to the recent DC films (except 'Green Lantern', but let's forget that ever happened), Marvel Studios' movies are unadulterated fun. 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Avengers' set the bar high for the level of sheer fun and Thor's latest continues along this path. It's also leaner than every other recent action blockbuster and all the better for it, as e.g. by the time the 30 minute climactic battle in 'Man of Steel' begins, the end credits start rolling on 'Thor: The Dark World'. Additionally, the action sequences are terrific and exhilarating, while the comedy is properly funny and occasionally hilarious. There's also an unexpected cameo from a Marvel regular that is one of the most joyous things I've seen all year. Alan Taylor uses his experience from the brilliant 'Game of Thrones' to great effect when approaching the fantasy worlds. As per usual, Tom Hiddleston is a delight to watch, lighting up the screen whenever he appears, while Hemsworth is efficient and the rest of the cast are solid. There are flaws – one or two plot strands disappear and some roles are underwritten. However, 'Thor: The Dark World' may not be a profound classic, but it is gloriously entertaining from start to finish and a very worthy addition to the ever-expanding Marvel canon. Also, make sure to stay for the entire ends credits, as we got, not one, but two post-credit sequences, which I won't spoil, but I will say that one of them offers an excitingly weird glimpse into a future Marvel movie.",8,2,7,3 November 2013
Looper," Dazzling
","There's a fundamental problem with time-travel that many have fallen victim to - too much physics and you leave the audience cold and befuddled; too many action sequences and emotion goes out the window. The real trick of making a truly great time-travel movie is finding the perfect balance between the two and in my opinion only two films have struck this difficult chord - Back to the Future and Twelve Monkeys (which also starred Bruce Willis). Well, now you can add Looper to that.Set in Kansas, in 2044, the story centres on Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - he's an assassin or 'looper' who's hired by a criminal organisation to kill targets sent back from a future where time-travel has been outlawed. However, during one particular contract, Joe is shocked to see that his latest target is his older self...One of the most brilliant things about Looper is its awareness of the headaches that too many paradoxes can induce. In a wonderful moment of dialogue, writer/director Rian Johnson basically tells the audience not to worry about the inner machinations of the genre's logic, 'This time- travel crap fries your brain like an egg', says Jeff Daniels' Mafia man Abe. But importantly, the place of the heart is not forgotten and the film succeeds on an emotional level just as well as it does on a technical one; which is quite a feat when your main character is cold-hearted and selfish killer.And speaking of Mr. Gordon-Levitt, he delivers his best performance yet, portraying Joe with maturity, depth and nuance. And no, the make- up was not distracting. Best of all, he does not imitate Bruce Willis, but instead plays the kind of young man who would grow up to be the Bruce Willis we all know. Willis gives his best piece of acting in years, trading the action hero smirk for touches of melancholia that pay off dividends. All this is exemplified in a diner- set scene between the two Joes which shows just how good these two actors really are.Emily Blunt does a completely convincing job as being more than just 'the female character'. Solid support also comes from the reliable Jeff Daniels and Paul Dano, while Noah Segsn is impressive and attention-grabbing as Kid Blue.The film is also Johnson's best. After seeing (and loving) the John Hughes meets Raymond Chandler-isms of Brick and the mishandled The Brothers Bloom (Gordon-Levitt and Segan were in both), I was interested to see where he'd go next, and frankly, he has outdone himself with Looper. No better is this seen than in a bravura montage which shows how JGL becomes Bruce Willis; it's poignant, violent, dazzling and tender.While there are flaws - some plot holes and a predictable final twist - as an overall piece, the film's positives massively outweigh its negatives, as far and few between they may be. It's easily one of the best films of the year.",8,1,5,18 October 2012
The Great Gatsby," The greatest 'Gatsby'
","Often when a classic novel is adapted into a film, a director leaves their personal tics outside the door in an effort to make an adaptation undying in its reverence to the source material. Appropriately, Jack Clayton's overly inert 1974 version of 'Gatsby' is an example, because it was simply a direct translation of the book on screen with no surprises or filmmaking flourishes. As its star, Robert Redford commented, 'If a film is just totally loyal to the book, then why make the film?' Unsurprisingly, the same cannot be said for Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's sublime novel, as this is clearly a Baz Luhrmann film in the same way that his take on 'Romeo and Juliet' was. For those unfamiliar with the Aussie director's filmography, what does this mean for the movie? The answer can be pinpointed to Gatsby's introduction in the film and how it contrasts with the same moment in Clayton's version. In the latter, Gatsby quietly approaches Nick and they engage in a gentle conversation; however in the former, the bombast of Rhapsody in Blue plays and a smiling Gatsby turns to Nick raising a glass of champagne as fireworks explode in the background and guests dance about wildly.'The Great Gatsby' is set over one summer in 1922, as fresh-faced stock- broker Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) moves to New York from the Midwest, living in a small cottage across a bay from his beautiful cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her blue-blooded husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Nick is slowly drawn to his mysterious millionaire neighbour by the name of 'Gatsby' (Leonardo DiCaprio) and becomes increasingly intrigued by his past.Many of this film's detractors have complained that it is a prime example of style over substance, which although not the case in my opinion, it is undeniable that it does carry a significant amount of style. The party scenes are so dazzling on initial viewing that they are almost dizzying; every frame appears as though Baz Luhrmann meticulously thought-it-over, which works effectively in portraying the inflating excess of the period. This 'Gatsby' is a real visual spectacle in the way that no previous adaptation of the novel ever was. Immensely detailed, the beautiful depiction of twenties-era New York feels very alive and vibrant, helping to keep the viewer consistently engaged in the period lifestyle . The movie's visual side is expertly complemented by an anachronistic Jay-Z produced soundtrack that works surprisingly well. One of the biggest flaws of the 1974 adap of Gatsby was Robert Redford's poor performance as the titular character. Thankfully, in reuniting with his 'Romeo + Juliet' director, Leonardo DiCaprio has become the greatest Gatsby. He perfectly inhabits Gatsby, understanding the depths and nuances of Fitzgerald's creation, delivering a performance that is by turns, assured, insecure, passionate and tormented. DiCaprio is supported by excellent cast who also manage to bring their characters to life, whether it be Tobey Maguire's effortless turn as narrator Nick, Carey Mulligan's great portrayal of Daisy (a considerably difficult role to nail) or Joel Edgerton's pitch-perfect grasp of Tom, holding his own brilliantly with DiCaprio in a hotel room scene.'The Great Gatsby' is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the greatest novels ever written and thankfully, it is safe to say that while Luhrmann has made a recognisably 'Baz Luhrmann' movie, he has also made a film that is pleasingly loyal to the book, grasping the subtleties in the text. This adaptation of the Roaring Twenties' definitive novel really does roar into life, much like Gatsby's yellow behemoth of a car. This is a lively, inventive and immersive piece of work with visual spectacle, emotion, impressive direction and superb performances. Finally, we have a great 'Gatsby'.",9,6,13,26 May 2013
