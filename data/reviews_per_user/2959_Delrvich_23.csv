Source Code," Good movie, but,...
","The plot and especially ending was a bit of a stretch to accept. Of course, I am probably being too harsh. Still entertaining.",8,0,1,26 November 2019
World War Z," Couldn't finish it
","Way too much action, lots of 'zombies', and not much explanation as to why this was happening, stopped watching after 10 - 15 minutes. 5 for the F/X and effort.",5,0,8,27 June 2019
Knives Out," Solid entertainment
","A little confusing, but, so are all great murder mysteries. I'd give it a 10 if it were an uplifting film.",9,5,18,29 November 2019
The Irishman," Good movie, but, ...
","The timeline should have been kept linear to avoid even minor confusion with a 3hr movie. 8 is for good movie, 9 a tragic movie with a moral, and 10 an uplifting movie with a moral.",9,1,5,27 November 2019
Match Point," Nine stars for trragedies
","With a moral. Moral. Some, with the undeserved trust of good and naive people, can have the luck of the devil.",9,0,0,2 January 2020
The Hateful Eight," Very well done
","In the '80s, movie reviews went so much simpler. You said 'It was good, OK, or sucked'. And, nowadays, movie reviewers seem to write a short essay. And that ten line requirement by IMDb doesn't help either. Anyway, it was good. Sure, it had some Tarantino staples, like the out of sequence storytelling, which can be a little annoying. One modern song which takes away from the movie like Django Unchained's ending shooting scene. Also, a lot of blood and dialogue. Overall, it was really good. Way, way, way better than the #1 movie of 2015 (Mad Max Fury Road).Hope to see more westerns like this and Bone Tomahawk (which I thought was even better, BTW).",6,13,46,20 December 2015
Southpaw," Good but ...
","Too much street dialogue and attitude (eg profanity, baby this baby that, no no no baby! etc .. ) and loose end that other reviewers have mentioned.",7,0,1,24 November 2019
The Italian Job," Good, but,
","Could have done better without the cliche team comradery, villain, and ending.",6,1,1,3 December 2019
"I, Robot"," Good movie, but,
",... the sarcastic lines by Will Smith sort of spoils the movie.,7,0,0,20 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It was good.
","Bravo on the late 60s scenery, TV and movie scenes, and props. But odd pacing.
Seemed to go on far too long fur what is essentially a short story involving three good friends.",6,9,26,27 July 2019
I Am Legend," Good but
",Some of the most careless mistakes that Robert Neville (Smith) had made raised suspicions of Anna and Ethan that went nowhere. Sort of spoiled the film ending and didn't justify the title much.,7,1,2,25 April 2020
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Barely a 6
","First off, I don't like most comic book movies as they don't translate to movies well and far too much is changed. And, that will probably never change so I am now criticizing them on a curve.Two of the biggest flaws in this movie and the previous one, are the portrayal of Dr. Doom and the dialogue. Doom is played like a bad spin on Gordon Gecko and not the terrifying crazed armored scientist. And the sophomoric comic book dialogue doesn't mix very well with the 'real world' look of the heroes. This makes for some cringe worthy moments like when this Doom is being chased by the FF and he yells 'Let's go a spin!' right before he puts them in a whirlwind.The Surfer is somewhat acceptable and Galactus, IMO, should have either not been included or played exactly as he is in the comics. In short, the movie was mediocre. The effects kept it from being panned even worse.",6,0,3,3 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Blech!
","I'll start by saying upfront I was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie.Being a primarily Marvel comic book reader and TV show/cartoon viewer since the mid-70s, I'm don't care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book. So yes, I started watching with a bias but three successive clichés in the first 15 minutes were immediate 'strike outs' for me. 01. the 'dancing to soundtrack while you work' scene 02. perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03. the 'hey, that's my property you're impounding ...give it back!' scene... Never mind, the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an CGI space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a CGI walking talking catchphrase spewing tree, or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack, etc...(yawn). I think you get the point. IMO, the best comic book movie, thus far, is Watchmen and I don't even read or care for DC comics. And no, I never read any Guardians of the Galaxy comics either.The movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all CGI.",8,35,76,22 August 2014
Jurassic World," A lot of this was so formulaic
","Making for a very predictable but somewhat, just barely, engrossing movie which relied heavily on the dinosaurs. It was so formulaic this could have been a parody with simply referring to characters, not by name, but titles like: 01. Devious person (D'Onofrio) 02. Common sense person (Pratt) 03. Slow to come around person (Howard) 04. The kids (Robinson and Simpkins) 05. Egoist person (Khan) 06. Trusty sidekick (Sy)but then that would spoil the movie, wouldn't it? Maybe not.And you'd think after three disastrous events, they'd permanently shut down the park.",7,4,11,14 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Comic books don't make good movies
","I don't believe comic books make good movies. Production and direction were very good but there's just too many unbelievable and long fight scenes, melodrama, Stan Lee cameos, quips, deviation from the costumes and books. Formulaic? I could go on and nit pick the differences I've already listed and bring up even more faults (eg If Ultron had an 'otherworldly' origin, why was his persona so hip?), but, in short, I was easily bored with this movie.IMO, the very best comic book movie to date is Watchmen which had everything most current comic book movies - short fight scenes, built tension towards the end, accurate costumes, seeming 'real' characters, etc...I'm sure the young crowd will love this. As a 40+ y.o., no.",2,12,28,23 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Gave this one some thought
","I had originally not made it past 15 minutes in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) before walking out because of too many clichés at once (eg classics used in soundtrack, dance while you work, the choreographed fight scenes, precise long shots like 'throwing a dagger 30 feet, hitting, and knocking an orb out of someone's hand as the ran away'.) and given it a 1.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) coming out prompted me to see them both and it was almost as hard to get through the first one again, but, I enjoyed it. 'I am Groot' was wearing thin then came the credit scenes.Then I started Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and more of the same kind of initial revulsion with the opening scene. But, then, in short, I concluded that these movies shouldn't be judged harshly as I've seen almost all the classics and some turkeys. Sure, GOTG 1 and 2 has elements of both, and a few clichés, but, with so many movies coming out of Hollywood, there's going to be some repetition and imitation.This movie gives Disney storytelling image a much need boost with the help of current and not so current culture. Sure, I don't like most comic book movies but, this one makes the short list of ones I really do like. I even upped my GOTG (2014) rating from 1 to 8.",10,12,23,30 April 2017
The Shape of Water," An genuine attempt to inspire people
","Sure, there are a lot of negative reviews and comments. But, I think the main point behind this movie is to possibly inspire people perhaps to actually get involved with the less fortunate (eg mentally disabled, physically disabled, elderly, orphans, animals, abused children, single parents, latchkey kids, etc...) who are, like the creature, being held captive (by others or their environment, and, even themselves).",9,3,6,11 July 2018
Joker," Tragic movie with a moral
","8 stars if the movie is excellent.
10 stars if the movie is excellent, inspiring, and has a moral.
9 stars if the movie is excellent, tragic, and has a moral.Every society gets the kind of criminal it deserves. What is equally true is that every community gets the kind of law enforcement it insists on.
Robert Kennedy",9,0,1,6 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Metza metz
","I don't understand the hype. In short, this movie came off very much like a play about the making of a play leading up to opening night. I found it very hard to be very sympathetic about the main character who is a 'washed up' Hollywood celebrity who has squandered his wealth and wants to recapture his fame. Some people might find that premise interesting but I didn't. Aren't most celebrities and stage actors just serious cutthroat attention seekers who court then shun public attention anyway and blow it in the process? Not that I have anything against celebrities, but fame is temporary and that's the nature of the business. It's invasive and prone to self-destruction. And mind you, I don't watch a lot of junk either so I think I'm being fair.",6,3,7,7 January 2015
Life," Good movie
","Sure, it had intelligent people doing foolish things like poking and prodding alien lifeforms but, I'd put this right up there with The Thing From Another World, The Thing, both Invasion of the Body Snatchers, etc... Apparently, the characters in this movie never saw those sci-fi classics.",9,0,0,26 November 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I was right about this film ...
","This another one of those action flicks....With one man army who has a few too many fight scenes, with groups of people, pulling off impossible tricks (eg bouncing a cue ball off the wall to hit someone in the back of the head), without ever breaking a sweat or missing a strike, and who doesn't get hurt.Of course, with it's stunts, violence, unbelievable scenarios, bizarre villains, and comic relief, the young people will rave about it. It reminded me a lot of Stormbreaker. It started out good but started to have to top itself from the previous over the top scene to maintain interest all the way to the very end.",7,11,23,24 May 2015
John Wick: Chapter 2," It was a lot of style but
","not much substance. Mind you, it was really well done, but, that doesn't make for a classic. It was like watching one of those video games movies play out in entirety.This kind of action flick was far better done by Michael Mann in Collateral. But, of course, you can't have two Collaterals, another Mendes/Craig James Bond. or Matrix trilogy, for that matter.And, IMO, John Wick is just under those. Almost all action and not much dialogue. At least, Matrix trilogy had some plot twists and a much better soundtrack. And, Wick 2 was far better than Mad Max Fury Road, by the way.Maybe if I were in my teens, I'd be calling this a masterpiece but, in late 40s, I am not anxiously awaiting a sequel which should be even more action and less dialogue, Shrug.",8,6,12,19 February 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," A complete debacle
","If I could give it more negative rating, I would.As a fan of the timeless trilogy, this should not have been remade, especially if they were going to 'rework' the character of Max who was a self-sufficient survivalist and main character.This movie would have been better served and a much higher rating and review given if George Miller had based it on a female character similar to Max and possibly involving another MFP cop who becomes her sidekick.This seems to be an attempt by George Miller to reboot his career using the material that made him a success.",1,30,70,17 May 2015
