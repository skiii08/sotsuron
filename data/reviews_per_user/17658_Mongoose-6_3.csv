Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great film effective setup for the episodes to come and those we have already.
","Lucas has done an excellent job of setting up for the next two episodes in the Star Wars saga.  Even in the parts of the movie where you knew something had to happen to get us to stuff in Episodes 4,5, and 6 you were on the edge of your seat in anticipation.  In example Anakins podrace win.  Lucas once again did a brilliant job of directing and writing the script.  Now let's see if Hollywood ignores this big budget blockbuster at the Academy Awards or they choose to hand the Oscars to the people who deserve them, namely Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Lucas Jake Lloyd also did a nice job. A 10 plus one of my all time faves.",10,0,0,1 July 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A classic story of love between a young boy and his friend.
","This story is one that still touches me to this day.  I remember watching it in the theater as a young boy in 1985 when it was rereleased, it touched me then and still does to this day.  Elliot made a friend with E.T. and the two became so close that Elliot knew E.T.'s feelings.  If you can watch this movie and not cry when Elliot and E.T. are telling each other goodbye, then you must be one cynical person.  E.T. and Elliot became so close in the purest form of love ever known.  A heartwarming tale of love and friendship that deserves its place among the great movies of all time.",10,1,2,17 June 1999
The Godfather," Why this is the best Mafia movie ever
","Coppola's intense films are the stuff of legend and the sweeping drama of the Corleone family that was begun in this film is no exception.  The script is well written by Coppola and Puzo, who wrote the book, the acting is superb, and the little things like the lighting and the music add to the intensity and the drama of this film.  Al Pacino in pretty much his first role is superb as the straight war hero son of the Corleone Family who gets drawn into the 'business' when his father is attacked.  Brando and Caan as well as Robert Duvall also deliver great performances.  The scene that sticks with you like the Baptism when Michael is having his enemies killed and its flashing back and forth between murders and the Catholic Baptism in Latin owing to the pre Vatican II setting is superb.  An excellent film well deserving of being ranked 3rd all time by the AFI.  The lighting is a superbly done job of being dark but light illuminating certain things much like a painting from the Dutch Master Rembrandt. All due respect to Blake Edwards but this movie is a '10'",10,0,1,9 August 1999
