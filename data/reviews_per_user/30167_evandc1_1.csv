Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Let's be serious...
","Honestly, this film isn't that great. I've been a long time fan of the Borat sketches, going back to Da Ali G Show in Britain years ago. The material shown in the Borat movie is almost all a stale rehash of what he has done in past years. Although many people may not have seen previous Borat sketches (and therefore might be more inclined to laugh during the movie) that does not help this film where it fails the most: The majority of the screen time is spent on pointless scatological, sexual, and otherwise juvenile jokes. It's awkward, its painful, and yes, it is funny, but it hardly merits the raving reviews this film has been getting. Except for a few scenes --Frat boys and Rodeo-- there was very little of interest in this movie. I also had the distinct impression that much of it was made from unused footage from Baron Cohen's HBO series with the 'plot' scenes tacked on to give some justification for Borat's antics. Really, don't waste your time or money on this one.",6,4,9,15 November 2006
