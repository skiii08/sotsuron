Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Guy Rithcie does it again!
","Very few sequels actually top their own predecessors, like the Two Towers. But this one surely is one of them. Having tackled Sherlock Holmes' most dangerous nemesis in the second movie itself, it was handled with the the kind of intensity that it deserved.The story-line was fluid and not overly complicated, the jokes hit the right spot (the Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law chemistry is perfect as it is). The effects were pretty good and the dialogues were perfect for the scenes. Stephen Fry's portrayal of Mycroft was better than perfect - it exceeded even the Mycroft from Arthur Conan Doyle's books!The only disappointment was the handling of Irene Adler... she could have been given more of a role. But that doesn't dent the movie at all, and the conclusion is pretty perfect.",8,0,1,30 December 2011
Megamind," Mega fun!
","I don't watch many animation movies except the very famous ones that are recommended to be damn good, but I had a feeling about this one. And it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen - animation or otherwise. I would rate it on the same level as Kung Fu Panda and Ice Age 3 (9 out of 10, 10 being death by lols).The plot in itself is engaging - a supervillain get terribly bored after vanquishing his arch nemesis - the Superman-heavy character Metroman. So he goes and creates a superhero of his own in order to get back to his good-vs-evil bit. But things don't go as planned - of course - and the movie just takes of from there.The characters feel real, the humor is very refreshing and off the cuff type, not your boring predictable sitcom style based on silly exaggerations. The level of the animation seemed quite good and the voice actors are perfectly suited for their roles - Brad Pitt as the superhero Metroman, Tina Fey as the beautiful reporter who keeps getting kidnapped by the evil Megamind voiced by Will Ferrel. There's even a minion named, well Minion. Throw in a douche bag cameraman, a grumpy jail house warden and the mayor for minor bits and we have a pretty solid cast.The best part is that while the movie is constantly hilarious, the plot and the characters don't stagnate at any point. Even though some parts are predictable, they are few and you aren't really watching a thriller so that you would expect a half dozen plot twists.One final thing - the music is awesome. In fact, it sets the tone of the whole movie and the choices made go really well with the characters and the situation.All in all, a superbly made, hilariously funny, refreshingly original and enjoyable experience!",9,6,10,14 January 2011
