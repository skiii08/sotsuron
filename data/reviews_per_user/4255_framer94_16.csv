Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 4.5/10 -meh
","Sacha Baron Cohen has been doing this robotic retarded Borat crap ever since 1999 (Ali G first appeared on 11'o'clock show in Britain in 1998, Borat character was introduced as part of the 'Ali G Show' round about 1999/2000... that' roughly 7 years of Borat... and Sacha uses the same lines and catch phrases in every sketch to he point of where you're wanting the character axed) ... if you've followed Sacha Baron Cohen ever since the late 90's, see pretty much all of his sh't, then this is just gonna seem like a waste of your time.The highlight of this movie for me was where he went to a Rodeo in Texas and aimed to insult every American in the place, then the horse carrying the American flag falls over on it's ass.4.5/10 -meh... would have given it a higher rating had he used new material, but he doesn't just recycles the same sh't to the point of where he's ny-on robotic.",4,0,0,22 December 2008
Fight Club," See iT Too BeLieVe iT...***9/10***
","Probably the most influential film since Pulp Fiction. The film questions reality, morality, manhood, and how the media influences society to be like sheep following one another. More importantly, the film shows us what a normal life can do to you.This is one of those films that you cant watch the once and catch everything--- every time you watch it, you learn something new-- and it's the little things which make you jerk forward, and say 'uhhh never saw that before-- that's clever!' e.g. the waiters advertised on teh hotel TV in Ed Norton's room work for him...wont be a cinema pest and spoil the rest though.The lighting is costantly at a green/lime light-like buzzing hue to make us feel in a state of non-being, and the sharp editorial implicates the melow state of existing before Norton meets Pitt in teh film.It's the film that put Ed Norton in the controversy line, showing evryone that he's ben in something worthwhile, not mindless hollywood sheep-garbage. It was also the second controversial Film Brad Pitt did before Snatch. Fight club could well of been a solid landmark, surpassing Pulp Fiction, but it's mainly aimed at youths aged 17-34, and doesn't necessarily appeal to people in their middle age because of the speed of the direction, etc. Plus the subject matter only appeals to youths anyhoo.Watch it, then watch it again to see what you missed, then watch it again to see what you missd before that time!Cracking---9/10***",9,0,1,1 September 2002
The Fifth Element," STYLiSH SCi-Fi, FRoM LuC BeSSoN
","This is one of the 3 movies that Luc Besson sent most of his life plotting, besides Leon, and Nikita.The story is set on eath in some 300 years hence, and involves a priest and a would-be 1000-and something year old supreme being (Milla Jovovich), from retreving 5 elements, which when alighened, will desroy a large demonic-death star that will bring eternal evil to earth, if not stopped within 48 hours...///along the lines, Gunh-Ho ex-military Jck-thel lad Bruce Willis gets mixed up in things, and trevels half-way across the solar system to get off with Milla Jovovich...The Bruce Willis' character plays kind of corny into the story, and is typical of a an American low-base Superman hero. The story is very predicatble and probably childish, but the film is unique for Luc Besson's perception of science-fiction, and funny alien monsters, etc. His camera work and direction is outstandingly unique and comparible to his other 2 well-known films. The costume and fashion designs are pretty orgional too, along with garry Oldman's psychotic, and Chris Trucker's lady-king preformances to take you on a roller coaster spins of action and adventure.Overall, it's not bad for a watch, and can be watched again at regular intervals of the year. Definately not one for the Oscars, but definately one of the best modern sci-fi's to date besides Men In Black and Star Wars. 5/10***",6,0,1,1 September 2002
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," 7.1/10
","Unlike previous Marvel movies- Iron Man, The Hulk, Spiderman, yada yada, I enjoyed this one (as much as I did X-Men and X2) While not equal to the greatness of the first 2 X-Men movies, this one is definitely better by a mile than X-Men 3- The Last Stand.My only quarm with it, is that some of the action sequences are poorly constructed in places, and the final battle is far fetched, over CGI'd, and not very believable.There have not been many decent superhero movies in the 19 years. The first 2 Batman movies, the first 2 Blade movies, and the first 2 X-Men movies stand out as the only decent ones to date, in terms of original dynamic direction, production, style, and characterization; and while this movie isn't AS GOOD AS the aforementioned movies, it is pretty close. In terms of what one should expect from a decent superhero movie, this movie does just that- hell of a lot better than the lame family friendly mediocre fun of Spiderman and Iron Man. Pretty funny to see Van Wilder as a mutant...My verdict: 7.1/10 - definitely worth a watch.",7,1,2,5 May 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," not as good as the first one, really lame, nothing special
","I seen the first movie on a plane when it came out. Was okay, ot excellent but not bad as far as superhero movies go these days.This one was really lame though- didn't like it at all... bored the hell outta me. Is made to be idiot friendly like most mainstream films. 3.0/10 (I give it 3 because of the special effects and make up here and there).Overall I don't recommend this depressingly mediocre crud to you at all. Go to the super bowl or do something more rewarding with your time, I regret ever having watched this title, and wish for my memory of it to be erased.",3,2,5,16 February 2009
Snatch," WiTTY, SaRCaSTiCaLLY FuNNY *8/10*
","Tag-Line (EUR): 'SNATCH- now you see it, now you dont!--you wha-?'Snatch was voted the best film of 2000 in the United Kingdom, and stayed a favourite for months in the charts of Europe too. The build upto this film was more anticipated in England and Europe than it was in the US, because of the initial impact of Guy Rithice's recent 1998 independant release of 'Lock, Stock & Two-Smoking Barrels.' Snatch uses pretty much the same script plan as Lock, Stock, only with a much larger budjet at hand, as well as some big hollywood names in the pan. The film's identity is dogged down with the appearance of Bennico Del torro (FRANKY-FOUR FINGERS), & partly by Brad Pitt (MICKEY). But somehow in an odd way, Pitt balances out nicely and does the film jusitce with his exellent take to a seedy pikey (Irish-liek slang, but either Irish or English dialect) accent, and dodgy make-over. Dennis Farina (COUSIN AVI), without making any offense...does a great, if not comical job of portraying the frustrated, greedy American/Jewish diamond jewller intent on getting things flow his own way, fed up with the constant 'alienation' from his much-loved artificial world of ritches, facing upto a hunt into the heart of the seedy British underworld. The film is fast paced with shifty, effective editing techniques (more jumpier than the ones in Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, that diserse the viewer from the past to the present, and add enthusiasim to the shear comedy of the irony which is 'accidental.' I must have seen Snatch at least 30 times now, both sitting down and while I'm working' Overall, an exellent to watch with anyone, but for the real macoy watch Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.",7,0,1,25 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," 5.5/10
","This film was released the same year to get all the fans and masses into the theaters while the franchise was on a role, in order to make some record breaking ca$h.The Matwix Revolutions feels like it's a prolonged durge/ after thought material leftover from the 2nd movie... I can't remember anything standout of the movie besides Smith and Neo's fight at the end, which must say that the majority of the film was filler. I enjoyed it more than Reloaded for some reason though.So who thought that Keanu Reeves would loose his eyes and die at the end? I never did! It's a happy ending, but also a sad ending, and, it worked. Didn't feel forced or over baked with a symphonic orchestra on standby or anything! Good watch! Not a masterpiece, but a good action film all the same! :D",5,0,1,25 April 2009
Spider-Man," ***3/10*** 'aN HoNeST To GoD DiSaPoiNTMeNT'
","Despite the hype to this film, it wasn't all that it's cracked upto to be. Columbia went through a heck of alot of caRe and expenditure to make sure that the movie was advertised as extensively as possible to ensure it's box office hits.I listened to the soundtrack before I seen tne movie and had hoped to what I was expecting to be an worthy equal to that of Tim Burton's Batman, the more recent X-MEN movie. And considering it was coming from teh view of Sam Raimi (director of the previously banned Evil Dead, Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn), I expected so much more. The writers didn't seem to get it, that theres as much adults who liek Spiderman as there is kids. Not forgetting that it's based on a 35 year old + superhero.The action sequences score high, and I liked the way they adapted the Green Goblin's form into that of an electronic flight-suit instead of Green Rubber spandex, but there's too much of a love interest, and the story is written accordingly to the origional Green Goblin story, which is a spoiler for the sort of people who live and breave these comics die-hard. The whole story is just 99% predicatble. Who hasn't seen an American superhero movie that they had sussed from the opening. It's an honest to God disapointment, and a real pitty, because a title like Spiderman had the pottential to go as far as Batman did in 1989, had the script been giving good looking at. The writers rushed this script, as theve done with the sequel to this, which is supposed to feature 'Doctor Octopus.'OK for a watch, but doesn't attempt to appeal to people over 13. ***3/10***",5,0,0,18 June 2002
The Dark Knight," 7.4/10 - so it wasn't douche
","I didn't really like Batman Begins... Batman has been commercial ever since the first movie in 1989, everyone from your granny to the school janitor knows how batman 'became.' To me it was just another excuse to sell Batman and make more money, regardless of how good the direction was.Well, I DIDN'T think The Dark Knight was douche, but I still prefer the 1989 Batman by Tim Burton over this one. No disrespect to the late Heath Ledger either, BUT I did prefer Jack Nicholson's Joker over Ledger's. I found, at times, Ledger's Joker, overly dark and annoying. I liked Two Face though- they made a really good job of that; MILES better than Tommy Lee Jone's Two-Face. MILES. Was a shame to see him get ****** instead of The Joker.At times Batman's voice was hard to make out what he was saying, and, towards the end, got kinda amusing to hear. Michael Caine was a terrible Alfred... I hate all this 'lets put an English sidekick in here to spill one liner after the hero explains or cracks something. Every time I see Caine I just think of camp 60's movies and the Italian Jobs, in the same way that I see Christian Bale in a suit and think of American Psycho. I like Bale's Bruce Wayne, but only because of his powerful role in American Psycho. To me, Chistian Bale in Batman, is Patrick Bateman dressed up as Batman XD.Sometimes the story moves a little too fast to keep up with (which wouldn't be a problem for the people that have growing up watching Batman movies'n'cartoons), but the average person would perhaps get confused.7.4/10- Overall.",7,3,6,18 September 2008
Pulp Fiction," SLiCK TaLKiN GaNSTeR FeST ***8/10***
","Probably Tarantino's most aclaimed movie. Woth it's blend of sweet-talking, back-chatting witt, 70's retro-pop culture, and invoative direction, it's remained a landmark of modern 90's cimena, and is still going strong today.The plot is quite simple, and relatively easy to follow--involving 3 stories which interlink into one another at one point in time or another. The first story, is about LA hitman Vincent Vega, played by TRVOLTA taking out his Boss' wife, Mia, to diner, and having to avoid th traditional boy-meets girl conversation, the second is a 'winner takes all' story, with Bruce Willis as a Boxer who is on the Run from his Boss, who is also Trvolta's Boss. Whereas the third sees Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson on a hit job gone wrong.
Like Reservoir Dogs, the movie is done in 'back to front' placement, where the beigining is teh end, the middle is the begining and the end is the prologue, etc. This was also the film which made Samuel L.Jackson's career, and put him at the top of the Hollywood foodchain, in coincidence, it was also the movie which put Travolta back in the 25 Million Dollar chain, making it one of the most legendary comebacks in History.The screenplay is really origional with lots of new witty cath phrases and ideolodgies implemented by Tarantino and Avary. More than anything else, the movie is about image, not story.Well worth the watch-- 8/10***",9,1,2,1 September 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," 'iT WouLD Be a CRiMe To MiSS it. BReaTHTaKiNG- *10/10*
","It takes film directors years to achieve this kind of status, as opposed to just carefully planning your first feature film from scratch. Against seemingly impossible odds, dogged by the ignorant film companies, Ritchie succeed in making a masterpiece. There are simply too many good points to comment on about this film, but the rhythm of it is ingenius in it's own way. The film may have been partialy inspired by that of the late Pulp Fiction, but uses a far more complex storytelling moethod, with more characters, more slapstick, and sarcasim. The main theme in genereal of the film is 'sarcasim' i.e. it's not funny to laugh at someone being shot, but now after seeing this it is. The film is ideal for all British, and European audiences, but for viewrs in America may be unsuitable, as it's difficult for someone who speaks with a strong American accent to follow regional English accents such as Scouse, Cornish, and Cockeny, which are frequently or partially recurrent throughout the film. The thing I thought most highly of this film was the way in which the sharp editing techniques and special FX blended in nicely with the background music & songs, portraying an almost real depiction of what it's like to be either devastated or horizontally-drunk beyond visualisation. Also teh way in which it's filmed. A highly-expensive rocket-fuel-iggnition lensed camera was used to achieve the glossy golden look that is underground London--go on my son'' Watch this then be spun, then watch it over to see stuff you missed. The director's cut's got extra footage, and 3 outakes from the film. IT WOULD BE A CRIME TO MISS IT--10/10",9,0,2,25 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," 5.3/10- okay sequel
","The Matrix ain't my fave movie, but I'll review it anyway, real short and sweet...I'm not a big fan of Hollywood movies. Most, like the Matrix are rip offs of Japanese animes. *The Matrix rips off Ghost In The Shell and Golgo 13, Van Helsing rips off Vampire Hunter D. Ben Stiller's character from Dodgeball is ripped from the Dragonball Z character Mr Satan (his film Zoolander rips off the Bret Easton Ellis novel 'Glamorama').It's got a lot of explosions and fighting and this that and the other. I think the tried to cram so much into this one though, that at times you weren't able to focus properly on the performances or other aspects of the production... basically they must think that anything can look good if you film it with green tinted lenses! XD some of the sexy Hollywood glamorama crap really got on my tits too- like the scene where the Frenchman is talking philosophical bullsh't and then the camera goes into the black and green Matrix mode and zooms under the table up to a girl's crotch, and the scene where the token black sub-character gets back to his quarter and is about to say 'hey where my pus--' ssy, but then suddenly sees the women with the kids (I can imagine that one was intended to make audiences roar with laughter, though the effect is actually more cringe inducing).5.3/10 -most action movies are crap mindless pieces of entertainment, made for the kind of people who listen to songs like 'Let The Bodies Hit The Floor,' who usually don't have a brain... that have people like Jean Claude Van Damme stuck in the straight to video industry, and a alcoholic, and Stallone staring in remakes of his own movies out of pure desperation for work. The Matrix offers a more creative approach to destruction, and has a lot of cool (slightly WTF) fight scenes that have been carefully orchestrated. In terms of originality though, it's nothing new...",5,0,0,25 April 2009

","One of the most influential movies of the 1980s. Whe you watch this movie, you actually feel taht your watching a movie that was made in the day of it's time. Sorcesse shot the film in b/w to ensure that the audience visualises the world in the gritty/dog-eat-dog society of the time.
The story is about a pre-psycho fighting madman who wont accept victory even though he;s heading straight to the top, and his borther and wife ensure the full heights of his madness and intimidation. At times the movie becoems so believable that the bleak atmosphere of the time, along with the b/w cinematography actually begins to bring you down. A genuine classic ***9/10***",9,3,5,18 June 2002
The Matrix," 6/10- okay sci-fi action movie
","I remember seeing the posters for the Matrix plastered all over the place in the summer of 1999. It looked like just another action movie... and after seeing it, it IS really, but is just a little bit better than most mainstream action films.Keanu Reeves is now Neo- every role he stars in is based on his icy soulless Neo character.One of the reasons I hate the Matrix is because it rips off a lot of animes instead of being influenced by them (The most obvious is Ghost In The Shell and Golgo 13). The other is that between 1999-2004, it was the sworn god of all goth dickwads on the face of the planet.All the actors in this movie, Reeves, Fishburne, the woman who plays Trinity, all of em I can't stand now, just because of all the hyperbole that was cemented into our heads to go see this film even if you've just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.If ever I watch this movie, it's to remind me of the year 1999 and NOT to enjoy the brilliance of it, if there is any.",6,1,3,25 April 2009

","Martin Sorcessee invites you for another spin into the tightly-knit world of the Mafia. Everything about the film is top-notch, and origional. The film is very addictive and hard to switch off, it's not one of those film where you tire of one thing going on, because the whole world Socessee has created is bright, bustling and full of life. It's the film that never sleeps. The characters interact on a 22/7 basis and maintains a strong atmospheric intensity throughout. The end though is much like that in Goodfellas, where all the top-men who know something end up getting wacked by the Mafia. An done of the best thing about this film, as all sorcessee fans probably know, is that there's nothing false or 'Americanised' about it, it is written from a first person's perspective.
