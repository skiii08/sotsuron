One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Family classic
","in my mind there are only 2 versions of this movie, the good one (1961) and the bad one (1996 ? ) this is a great classic when I was a younger i would watch it and then rewind it, all day! it is great. the main characters are Pogo Perdita and their 15 pups which grows to 100 pups!and of course there is their humans, 'pets' according to Pogo, Anita and roger. there is a newer version that isn't animated, but it ruins the movie, b/c Pogo is supposed to be able to talk and the animals all work together to save the pups but when they use real dogs and humans it takes away part of the fiction, glamor, and fun of the movie. i grew up in the 90s and didn't realize until today that it was made in the 60s. its not made w/ 'todays' kind of animation meaning it is all done w/ a computer and tries to look like real life, in my opinion it is better than any new animated movie. also boys and girls alike enjoy this classic. there are some movie that you watched in your childhood and go back and watch them and think they are not that good, but no matter how old or young you are its a guarantee you will like this movie. its wholesome, speaks of family, loving, and taking care of each other and it has a few good songs, that are lots of fun to sing along to, and even when you haven't seen the movie in a while you will remember the words and hum the tune, a song you just cant forget.",10,5,5,22 August 2006
