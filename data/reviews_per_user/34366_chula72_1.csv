The Ring," Excellent Horror Flick!
","This movie had suspense, drama, and sit-at-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller feeling from beginning to end. I'm not a big horror fan, but this movie is very good. It not in the least bit bloody, just very creepy. I have not been scared by a movie and been in total suspense like this in years. This movie grabs you and does not let go. I would definitely love to see a sequel made to this horror flick. I would pay the money to see it. Even long after the movie is over, you cannot rid your mind of the images that have just been displayed on your TV. In the dark you will keep thinking about everything that you have seen. I will end my comments with this, you will never look at your TV the same way again. Rent this one today, if you haven't seen it already. You won't regret it! :o)",Null,1,2,31 May 2004
