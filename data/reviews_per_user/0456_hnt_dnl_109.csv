Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good sequel, but not quite there!
","KILL BILL, VOL.2 is a solid Tarantino offering, but having seen it several times, I still prefer KILL BILL, VOL.1. VOL. 1 literally cuts to the chase and although it had no character background and appeared plot less, it accomplished more with very little than VOL.2 did with a lot! And the LOT was a LOT of dialogue, a LOT of exposition, and a LOT of explanation! Trying to explain and justify everything and talk the viewer to death is not always a good thing. I'd seen Tarantino do the talkative stuff in PULP FICTION, which was brilliantly done. But KILL BILL VOL.2 is simply a retread, rather than being highly original.I do think I understand why Tarantino did it differently from VOL. 1. I mean, if he repeats VOL.1, then he essentially presents more of the same, a plot less, action-oriented, bloodfest. But on it's own, VOL.1 is just a great film experience and even with it's open ending, I didn't care about a sequel. Ironically, I was not just enthralled by VOL.1 because of the great action, music, and swordplay, but also felt VOL.1 DID have its emotional, powerful moments, such as The Bride reacting to losing her baby, the Hattori Hanzo scenes, ORen's anime backstory, and The Bride and O'Ren's obvious emotional ties to each other. VOL.2 continues the story of The Bride from VOL.1. Now we find out WHY she needs revenge on Bill and her former Deadly Viper Assassination Squad cronies. We finally meet and see Bill (David Carradine in the best performance of this film). Bill is the main reason that I really like this film. His character is world-weary, wise, and calm, yet at his heart he is spiteful, sad, and angry. I found myself completely focused on his character during the opening wedding rehearsal scene. Soon after Bill and The Bride's reunion, he has the squad massacre the wedding party, as we saw the result of this carnage in VOL.1.Soon after we meet Bill's brother Budd (played by Michael Madsen in a really convincing performance). Budd is completely a broken man now, with a dead end job living in a trailer out in the middle of the desert. Bill warns Budd the The Bride is out to kill the squad and tells of how she did in O'Ren Ishii and her army in VOL. 1. Budd doesn't seem to care. When The Bride confronts him, Budd actually gains the upper hand and buries her alive.During her burial, The Bride flashes back to when Bill put her under the tutelage of the great martial arts master Pai Mei. These are among the best scenes of VOL.2, a retro homage to those Bruce Li 70s martial arts flicks. It explains how The Bride learned her moves she used so effectively in VOL.1. She uses a technique she learned from Pai Mei to escape her grave that Budd put her in.Soon after we meet one-eyed Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah in a really juicy role). Elle hates The Bride with a passion, mostly due to jealousy of her skills and her relationship with Bill. Budd has stolen The Bride's Hanzo sword (which Hattori Hanzo made for her in VOL.1) and is going to sell to Elle for one million dollars. Elle backstabs Budd by putting a deadly snake in the case containing the money. As Elle leaves Budd's trailer, she and The Bride have the big showdown. A really gritty fight scene, the polar opposite of the stylish presentation in VOL.1. We find out how Elle lost her eye and the end of the scene is kind of ironic, yet appropriate.The Bride seeks out Bill for her final vengeance in Mexico. I really disliked the scene where she finds one of Bill's old mentors to track him down. It seemed so unnecessary and it was a really odd scene. I disliked the strip club scene where Budd was demoralized by his boss, too. I found these smaller characters to add nothing to the film and detract from the strong main characters. I really disliked The Bride's soon-and-never-to-be husband at the beginning of the film; he annoyed the heck out of me and her friends weren't much better. I just couldn't buy into the fact that a woman like The Bride would even be associated with people like this, even in her attempt at a new life away from being an assassin.I still think VOL.2 has it merits, especially in the interactions amongst The Bride (whose name we learn in VOL.2) and Bill, Budd, and Elle. Their work really makes you believe these people have known each other for years and fallen out of favor with each other. The dialogue rambles on a bit much and meanders nowhere at times, especially with the supporting characters. Also, even though The Bride had a much tougher time conquering her final enemies in VOL.2, everything seemed strangely too 'neat'. Tarantino aimed more for realism, but didn't do a great job of making things 'realistic'. And you kind of have to do that with a film like this.",7,0,1,21 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very underrated prequel
","Of course there is no way that one can duplicate the sheer force of movie enjoyment that is the original 1977 all-time pure entertainment popcorn flick STAR WARS. And NO ONE should have expected that magic could be duplicated. But I'm here to tell you: THE PHANTOM MENACE is a pretty fun flick in it's own right! Following in the footsteps of STAR WARS IV: A NEW HOPE, this film actually copies that formula very well. An assortment of heroes (human, alien, and robotic) band together to save a queen (in STAR WARS it was a princess) from a galactic terror The Trade Federation (in STAR WARS it was the evil Empire).PHANTOM MENACE gets off to a promising and exciting start with 2 Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (played excellently by Liam Neeson, who does a good job carrying the film as the lead) and young Obi-Wan Kenobi (reliably played by Ewan McGregor, who would obviously continue the role in the other 2 prequels) landing on the Federation ship to discuss the terms of a treaty between the Federation and the Imperial Senate, but the evil Federation leader tries to have them killed. The Federation is also holding the planet Naboo hostage, so the Jedi rescue the Queen Amidala (a captivating young Natalie Portman) and hide her out in the remote planet of Tatooine, the home of young Anakin Skywalker (we all know who he becomes!).On Tatooine, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan learn that this boy Skywalker (played by the very young Jake Lloyd) is blessed w/ the powers of The Force and enlist him in a pod race to win money to pay for their ship parts and repairs. This pod race scene is one of the most exciting modern-day action sequences ever put to film. An example of when CGI totally works! I NEVER tire of seeing it. If you don't like ANY OTHER scene in this film, you've got to like this one! Unbeknowst to the Jedis, there is a more evil force pulling the strings of the Federation, a dark knight Darth Sidius who compels them to get the treaty signed. Sidius enlists an apprentice, Darth Maul, to help move things along.The Jedi (bringing Anakin with them to be trained as a Jedi) get the queen to Coruscant, the home planet of the Imperial Senate and the Jedi Council. Residing at the head of the Jedi is none other than our good friend Yoda! The 2nd-in-command on the council is Mace Windu (effectively played by Samuel L. Jackson), who is leery about the boy Skywalker becoming a Jedi. Senator Palpatine (well played by Ian McDarmid) from the queen's planet Naboo gets her to call for the expulsion of Senator Valorum (good work by the veteran actor Terence Stamp) as the head of the Senate.The tale is actually simple, although it all sounds convoluted and complex. What I like about THE PHANTOM MENACE is that it is much like the first STAR WARS in that it is fast-paced (although it contains a lot more dialogue and scenes and of course CGI) and is just about adventure. It doesn't care about back-story or reasons or character motivations. The four-pronged finale of (1) Amidala and her royal guard fighting palace droids, (2) the Gungans fighting the techno-troopers, (3) Anakin and the Naboo pilots attacking the Federation shiop, and (4) the lightsaber duel of Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan battling Maul is exhilarating. Of course there are some noticeable minuses. *Jar Jar Binks and the Gungans are not good characters and it seemed a bit tacked on how they were the key to defeating the Trade Federation in the climactic attack. *Because Jake Lloyd is featured as young Anakin and has quite a bit to do, it is somewhat hard to take that he is going to be Darth Vader one day. But he's just a kid, and he's not that bad, but his lack of acting skill is rather noticeable. Also, MENACE has some rather bland dialogue. The dialogue in STAR WARS wasn't Shakespeare, but it was very succinct, with quotable lines and the actors made it sing. It was simplistic without seeming simple, like it is in this prequel. Yet it's not nearly as bad as others say it is.The story, the novelty, the pacing, the adventure sold us on the 'original'. Also, I think the CGI is used pretty well in MENACE and doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. The CGI podrace was best sequence of the film. At least PHANTOM MENACE has at least got these elements working in it's favor enough to make it an enjoyable film experience!",7,5,11,6 January 2009
Training Day," Provocative allegory about good and evil
","In re-visiting TRAINING DAY (2001) recently, I have absolutely no doubt that Denzel Washington deserved his Best Actor Oscar. He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray. But the obvious standout is Washington, whose powerful performance wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar...And he got it!",9,1,2,11 May 2008
Unbreakable," Underrated film
","When I think of my favorite filmmakers, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't even usually register. I know he's made some suspect flicks ever since his early successes in the late 90s/early 00s, with a recent re-juvenation with the highly acclaimed blockbuster Split and the pending Glass which feels like another surefire success. In between, he's definitely made some head-scratchers, although I kind of enjoyed The Visit more than I thought I would. While The Sixth Sense is probably considered his best film among most, I honestly was kind of bored by it and think it was a wee bit pretentious. I actually believe his best films (so far) are between Split and this one I'm reviewing UNBREAKABLE (2000). 
I'm not the biggest fan of either Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson, but this might actually be arguably the best film that either of them have been in! Yeah, I know they were both in this popular flick called Pulp Fiction and have separately been in a lot of good stuff, but in terms of quality, the level of their acting, the naturalistic writing, atmosphere, and direction, this is probably the true best film either of them have done, in my opinion. And, to me, unlike the rather gimmicky Pulp Fiction which looks dated 20+ years later, Unbreakable looks like a flick that looks fresh even in 2018. Willis is superb as David Dunn, a depressed family man who is a native Philadelphian (film's setting, duh it's Shamalyan! LOL) and works as security at the city's football stadium. In the film's opening Dunn survives a train derailment that killed every passenger except him. Upon being released, David is reunited with his wife Audrey (strong performance by Robin Wright) and son Joseph (impressive work by Spencer Treat Clark). David was on a job interview in New York and planning to divorce Audrey, who he's lived in an estranged marriage for years. News of the tragedy piques the interest of another native Philadelphian Elijah Price (brilliantly played by Jackson). Price is a collector of classic comic books and owns a his own art gallery. Elijah was born with a rare disease where his bones are incredibly fragile and easy to fracture. He's suffered multiple bone breaks during his life and walks with a cane. Price contacts Dunn and theorizes that David is the opposite of him, a human with superpowers and encourages David to embrace his gift.The film is a provocative, interesting exploration into the possibility of a person actually having superhuman abilities and the pressure, strain, and responsibility that goes along with it. David was also an ex-football player whose career was ruined in a car accident many years earlier, so this new 'gift' is like a second calling for him. Shyamalan occupies the film with a sequence of strong, character-driven scenes that build up exquisitely through dialogue and character. No explosions, no CGI, no car chases, just good old-fashioned conversation. The acting is uniformly excellent and in addition to the aforementioned Willis, Jackson, Wright, and Clark, solid work is done by Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's mother as well as by veteran Elizabeth Lawrence (of All My Children fame) in a spooky scene at Joseph's school.I definitely like this film more than Sixth Sense and it's probably on equal footing with Split for me. And with the pending Glass, looks like Shyamalan is back!",10,12,22,27 July 2018
Star Trek," Star Trek...Rebooted!
","The original STAR TREK series was a TV landmark. The series ran only 3 seasons, but is now perhaps the most cult of all series of all time! Grounded in character, ideas, and stories, it is a classic. Can you re-create that magic? Yes, with STAR TREK 2009! Thanks primarily goes to TV creator J. J. Abrams (LOST, ALIAS), who directed this exciting, smart, fast-paced, thrilling adventure film.A Romulan ship, the Narada, comes from the future. The ship's captain, Nero, played with appropriate Star Trek villainy by the excellent Eric Bana (MUNICH), is looking for Ambassador Spock. Nero destroys the USS Kelvin in his search and kills the Captain, but not before its First Officer George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) makes the ultimate sacrifice by remaining on the ship to allow escape shuttles to get away. Kirk's wife (played by HOUSE's Jennifer Morrison) is having a baby and they name him James Tiberius Kirk.Flash forward: we see how Kirk and Spock grow up on their respective planets and end up at Starfleet Academy. Kirk is played by Chris Pine and Spock by Zachary Quinto and both these actors are revelations in these iconic roles! I had SERIOUS doubts going in, but they both sold me! Pine captures Kirk's bravado and cheekiness, while Quinto channels Spock's inner turmoil of being half-Vulcan, half-human. But neither is quite the Kirk and Spock we all know from the TOS because this is their EARLY story when both just are finishing up at Starfleet, so we get to see doubt, uncertainty and youthful indiscretion from the two men.On the way to Starfleet, Kirk meets fellow cadets Dr. Leonard McCoy (an astonishingly good Karl Urban, who both looks, acts, and sounds like DeForrest Kelley!) and Uhura (a perky, but underused Zoe Saldana, who I found to be the really only annoying and unconvincing replacement; Saldana reminds me NOTHING of Nichelle Nichols!). Three years into their Starfleet training, the almost-officers are all commissioned early aboard the newly christened USS Enterprise due to reports of a mysterious ship destroying planets (Nero's Narada of course!). Captain Christopher Pike (excellent work by great veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) christens the Enterprise on its maiden voyage/mission and makes Spock his First Officer. Kirk had to sneak on board due to being on academic probation for suspicion of cheating on the infamous Kobayashi Maru test! At the piloting and navigation controls are Lt. Sulu (solid John Cho) and Ensign Chekov (winningly played by Anton Yelchin).Nero orders Pike to board the Narada the same way he ordered the Kelvin Captain 25 years earlier, but Pike has Kirk, Sulu, and another officer to chute down to Vulcan to destroy Nero's detonating drill that is to deploy the matter that will destroy Vulcan. Kirk and Sulu survive, but can't destroy the drill and are beamed back up. Spock beamed down to save his parents and the Council, but his mother didn't make it and now he is conflicted. Kirk has a plan to stop Nero and save Pike, but Spock won't listen, Kirk defies orders, and Spock has him put on a Starfleet outpost on an ice planet.On the planet, Kirk finds none other than Ambassador Spock from TOS! Leonard Nimoy, who created one of the most unique, memorable characters in TV history, resumes the role of Mr. Spock here to great effect! He explains to young Kirk that Nero's arrival 25 years ago created an alternate timeline and that he must return to take command of the Enterprise, his destiny. Spock created 'red matter' to destroy a Supernova aimed for Romulus. Too late to save the planet, he still deployed the matter to destroy the nova, but instead the matter-nova combination created a time portal which shot The Narada and Spock's ships into the past (The Narada 25 years earlier than Spock). Nero, after destroying the Kelvin, waited for Spock, put him on the ice planet so he could see Vulcan destroyed.Kirk and old Spock find the station and meet Montgomery Scott (played with hilarity by the wonderful Simon Pegg from SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ), a Starfleet Engineer stationed on the ice planet. Old Spock informs Scotty that he created the formula for Transwarp drive and so Scotty uses it to beam Kirk and himself to the Enterprise, where Kirk compels young Spock to relinquish command due to his emotional conflict. Now, with Kirk the Captain, the crew brainstorms and forms the plan to take down Nero.The thing that I like about this reboot is that anything can happen now! It has effectively changed a lot of things in the Star Trek universe, so that this new series is no longer confined to the universe of TOS or any of its sequels. It's not your daddy's Star Trek! The casting choices are really uncanny. As a stand alone film, STAR TREK 2009 is a nonstop thrill ride. You barely have time to breathe, but yet somehow you still are able to connect just enough to these iconic characters and feel for them. I did have a few questions about some potential inconsistencies in the the alternate reality and my knowledge of TOS, but it's entirely possible that the alternate reality that Nero created 25 years earlier can explain some most, if not all, these things. I still say that STAR TREK 2009 works!",8,1,7,26 August 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Nice try, Quentin, but absolutely no cigar!
","Immediately, a lot of moviegoers claim INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) to be Tarantino's best work. I beg to differ.Now that the 00s is coming to a close, he has made 4 films this decade: KILL BILL VOL1 (2003), KILL BILL VOL2 (2004), DEATH PROOF, and this film. DP is self-indulgence defined and a true turd of a film and somehow, just based on Tarantino's fame (or infamy) has a 7+ rating here on IMDb! That alone is reason enough to suspect IB's 8+ rating so far. I believe that KB1 is a contender for best film of the decade because it is the ONE Tarantino film that cuts to the chase and perfectly fuses elements of the genre it pays homage to, while modernizing it WITHOUT seeming self-important. It came together as a flawless film, but due to it's minimal dialogue, extremely high body count, and lack of 'plot', it won't be considered to be his best of 00s or even his best film (but it should be because it is!). KB2 is really just more of the same talky drivel that you've seen before in most Tarantino films, but loads better than DP, not really saying much as, again, DP is crap! So, in the 00s, Tarantino can claim one certified masterpiece (KB1), a so-so sequel (KB2), a crapfest (DP), and now this film IB.Loaded with dialogue (English, German, French), while a lot of it interesting, what's the point? Many times I felt Tarantino's string-pulling behind the actors. The characters don't seem authentic simply due to the overemphasis on dialogue. The film has a couple of tense, solidly acted scenes early on, but again, even they come off as very predictable. The film really goes downhill after the first couple of chapters degenerating into a weak climax and confusing ending.Tarantino, more often than not, suckers audiences with pretentious, self-congratulatory nonsense. PF is an example of his best use of dialogue. DP his worst. IB falls somewhere in between and I put it closer to DP simply b/c I think the dialogue in this movie is almost as tedious to listen to as DP, with the addition that in IB, everything feels staged. Tarantino literally stalls the plot so much with his chapter divisions, unnecessary narrations, and untimely use of violence and humor that the film ends up being a frustrating exercise in patience.The most obvious best part of IB is the character of Colonel Hans Landa (played brilliantly by Christoph Waltz, who won Best Supporting Actor of 2009). This is a prime example of a truly great performance that is the standout in a mediocre film. But no other major character is even in the atmosphere of Waltz, although Melanie Laurent (the female lead Shosanna, a French-Jewish escapee of Landa's opening scene massacre of her family) is exceptional early in the film doing a great job of non-verbally acting, but after the Landa restaurant scene, Tarantino really lets her character down as he sporadically shows her anymore and gives her very little to work with emotionally, and this is not good as hers is perhaps the most key character of the film. Next to Waltz, the best performance is by Diane Kruger (as German double-agent Bridget von Hammersmark), who leaves a real impression as she effortlessly relays her character's duplicitous nature. Nominal star Brad Pitt (as Lt. Raine, head of the Nazi-killing Allied unit) is pretty good and fairly humorous, but you never get any sense of who he is as Tarantino has Pitt play him a bit too comical and cartoonish. But really most of the characters (except Landa) are hampered with inane dialogue. Landa comes out the winner simply b/c he's the only one that seems 'real'.Also, was the purpose of this film for the viewer to hate the Nazi characters? Because if it was, he failed miserably! If anything, he managed to most of German officers and Nazis (even Hitler himself!) sympathetic characters. Now THAT is blasphemy!Tarantino noticeably uses music in some form from all his previous films in IB and this is a big no-no for me! I don't want to be reminded of PF, JACKIE BROWN, and KB when I watch INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS! I want the film to have it's own identity. Borrowing from other, much older films and creating uniqueness out of that is one thing, but borrowing from your own films within the last 10 years is just plain egotistical! Most of the music is strangely weak and misplaced.Most of the characters don't feel individualistic, just like Tarantino-quoting pupils. There is one very noticeable casting gimmick that just plain doesn't work and really underscores the uneasy comedy-drama mix in the film. But the one word that describes this film...PREDICTABLE! Pretty much at the start of every big scene, the viewer knows what's coming just based on the way Tarantino sets things up. There was nothing predictable about PF or the KB films, or even the insipid DP. But in IB, you can see the finish line from a mile away. In reality, IB is just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing. And in that regard, it's not a good film, no matter how good the editing, art and costume design are. Deep down, there's nothing there. Just more of Tarantino's splicing and patchwork disguised as a film.",5,5,9,15 December 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Good movie, but far from perfect
","Interestingly, while the trailers for 2015's highly anticipated 'Star Wars:The Force Awakens' failed to impress me, I loved that film when I saw it, while the trailers for ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) had me pumped up and excited and I left the theater somewhat disappointed and underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, there are several positives to this new offering to the Star Wars franchise, but there are several noticeable flaws.R1 is a direct prequel to the 1977 classic 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope', telling the story of the band of rebels who actually stole the Death Star plans that we saw Princess Leia upload into R2-D2 in the first movie. The central character of R1 is Jyn Erso (earnestly played by Felicity Jones), whose father Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of 'Casino Royale' and the TV series 'Hannibal' fame) is the principal scientist/architect involved in the creation of the planet-killing superweapon Death Star. In the film's opening sequence (no crawl in this one), the elder Erso is compelled to come out of self-imposed exile with his wife and young daughter to return to construction of the superweapon by the Empire's high-ranking Director Krennic (passionately played by Ben Mendelsohn).After the opening scene, flash forward 15 years to the time period of the film, where Jyn, now a young woman and a prisoner of the Empire, is rescued by the rebels and taken to the secret Rebel headquarters on the planet Yavin. Jyn is briefed by Alliance Leader Mon Mothma (well played by Genevieve O'Reilly) and Rebel spy Captain Cassian Andor (solidly played by Diego Luna) that they need her on a mission to the planet Jedha to find a rogue rebel Saw Gerrera (played by Forest Whitaker), who has made contact with Galen through a defecting Imperial pilot Bodhi (played by Riz Ahmed). Accompanying Jyn and Cassian on the mission is Andor's co-pilot K-2SO (played in scene-stealing fashion by Alan Tudyk), a re-programmed Imperial droid that now serves the Rebellion. The trio find Saw, who has a message from Galen on a flaw in the design of the superweapon. Along the way, they pick up Bodhi as well as a couple of stray Jedha warriors in Chirrut and Baze (humorously played by Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang).The ragtag band of 6 rebels Jyn, Cassian, K2SO, Bodhi, Chirrut and Baze eventually gather help from a band of rebel soldiers and the team in the exciting climax execute a sneak attack on the planet Scarif, the location of the archive that houses the plans to the Death Star.My general issues with this film are: 1) The characters are generally very bland and monotone. Ironically, the only character of substance was the droid K-2SO. Not one main human character really stood out. Forest Whitaker was utterly useless and a waste of screen time. Bodhi was a defector, but we never knew why. Jyn too easily fell for the cause, but the events of the film contradict that she should feel this way. And everyone just followed Jyn's lead for no apparent reason.2) The Erso subplot felt almost like a retcon. The filmmaker made the entire key to destroying the Death Star a manipulative family melodrama instead of just having the rebels steal the plans so that the Alliance could examine them for any flaws, as was implied in the original '77 film. Basically, according to R1, EVERYONE in the Rebellion knew about the flaw prior to the events of the '77 movie. It almost makes the mission seem futile.3) The casting of Jyn Erso feels too much like fan pandering. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rey in 'The Force Awakens', but her story felt more genuine and like the filmmakers wanted to jumpstart the new trilogy with not just a strong female character, but a strong character. With Jyn, it feels like the filmmakers are saying 'screw it, we're casting a female as the lead and there's no other option'. I think this sentiment to only cast a female as lead devolves into dangerous territory where it begins to feel like shoehorned, disingenuous melodrama as was the case with Jyn and the Erso family in this. And Jyn being the main character failed to engage me or leave any kind of impression. She was just there, a nominal lead to say the least.4) The film was actually too short, at about 2 hours, 15 minutes running time. It would have been better served to have fleshed out the main characters more and tossing the Jyn Erso-nominal lead in favor of a true ensemble dynamic. Speaking of the Erso subplot, the Krennic-Galen dynamic was a fail. I guess they were supposed to be old friends who ended up with different loyalties, but the director never expanded on it. Plus, Krennic's character was too much of a non-imposing villain, albeit Mendelsohn did the best he could with a vigorous performance.I've already mentioned a few pros, such as the great K-2SO droid character, a few good human characters such as Krennic, Mothma, and Andor, as well as the great finale. A couple other pros as the inclusion of some of the characters from the original film, especially the iconic villain Darth Vader. There's a scene near the end that is genuinely scary and horrific, the scariest presentation of the character ever. It's really the Easter Egg moments like this that make the movie more watchable than most of the other stuff, which at times doesn't have the feel of a Star Wars movie.Director Gareth Edwards did an admirable job and infused the film with noticeable elements of the original movie, as he kind of had to, but the overall story of R1 feels somewhat disjointed from the Star Wars mythology. Still, an entertaining movie overall nonetheless.",6,1,6,18 December 2016
Shaun of the Dead," Funniest film of the 00s!
","Much as I loved the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost-Edgar Wright vehicle HOT FUZZ from 2007, they're earlier film collaboration SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) is a hell of a lot FUNNIER! For me, the main reason that HOT FUZZ worked was because it was more a great homage to all those 80s/90s action movies (with a bit of British horror sprinkled in there), with many nonstop, neat, nifty references throughout that reminded me lovingly of those flicks I grew up watching and admiring. Yes, HOT FUZZ is a comedy and a well done one, but at the same time, it is definitely more of an homage/tribute/action-oriented vehicle than it is a comedy. Whereas SHAUN OF THE DEAD falls more into the comedy/parody category and a damn funny one at that! Directed by the super-talented Edgar Wright, SHAUN stars Simon Pegg (in a hilarious performance that was Oscar-nomination worthy) as the titular hero Shaun, a lazy, unambitious bloke who manages a London electronics store. Shaun's frustrated girlfriend Liz (the gorgeous and funny Kate Ashfield) implores him to make something of himself and stop hanging around with his even more shiftless best friend Ed (the eternally hilarious Nick Frost). Liz lives with her best friend Dianne (Lucy Davis in a wonderful, scene-stealing performance), whose boyfriend David (played with stoic, solid humor by Dylan Moran) once was in love with Liz. Shaun's mum Mary (gracefully played by Penelope Wilton) is married to Phillip (vet Bill Nighy), a man that Shaun despises.This eclectic group gets thrown together one crazy day when flesh-eating zombies (is there any other kind?!) overtake London and they must work their way to the local pub, which SHOULD be safe! Along the way, the group runs into Shaun's friend Yvonne (hilarious Jessica Stevenson) and her group (an utterly funny scene), then before they navigate their way to the pub, Dianne (a wannabe actress) gets the group into character acting like zombies to fool the ones blocking the pub. Once in the pub, personal issues come to a boiling point that coincides with the group's chaotic situation (just like in any disaster film!).What amazed me about SHAUN was how fast-paced it is. It almost plays like an action movie once the zombie attack starts. The film never really slows down and when it takes time for characters to confront each other, it never loses sight of the severity of the situation and in come the zombies! The humor is dead, solid, perfect, especially the way the characters naturally react to their undead attackers and use their wits (what little they have!) to overcome the situation.Ironically, although I'm a sucker for horror-slasher flicks, the 'zombie' sub-genre is the one that I like the least (I'm more into the psycho killer type flicks), but SHAUN is just so funny that it won me over! SHAUN blows the doors off the much ballyhooed, overrated remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD, which came out the same year and slowed down to the point of being a total bore and also had less talented actors in it than SHAUN does. SHAUN is about as funny as REAL comedy gets!",10,2,5,28 July 2010
Star Trek Into Darkness," Superb/superior follow-up to a very good reboot!
","I am a monumental fan of Star Trek:TOS, truly one of the most original (no pun intended!) series of all time. But I generally disliked all of the 'sequel' series that came in the 80s and 90s. None of them engaged me the way TOS did. I can STILL watch the 60s series episodes and be firmly engaged, but you'd have to PAY me to re-watch TNG, DS9, Voyager, or Enterprise! All of them are in their own ways kind of clunky and generic copies of what TOS stood for (although DS9 came the closest to getting it right). And don't EVEN get me started on those atrocious TNG movies, which were just tepid extensions of that overrated, tepid series! I'm a Kirk/Spock/McCoy guy, not a Picard/Data/Sisko/Janeway guy.So when the 2009 Star Trek reboot happened with all my favorite characters, I was highly anticipating it, and overall, I very much liked that movie. That said, I understood the detractors and hardcore Trekkies who felt that it wasn't quite 'Star Trek'. The film, while very fast-paced, exciting, and fun, definitely lacked the deep characterizations from TOS, even though it contained all of the original characters. But where I give that film a pass is that it shows the characters when they were MUCH younger, inexperienced, and just Starfleet cadets, so it made sense that they didn't have the depth of the originals. But I definitely concur that the immediate sequel HAD to up the ante and be deeper, and did it ever! I am glad to say that STAR TREK:INTO DARKNESS (2013) tops it's very good 2009 predecessor by leaps and bounds and one can actually now see these still-young characters will become the deep characters from TOS. I dare say that this film is easily the second best Star Trek film of all time, with 'Wrath of Khan' of course being top dog (an incredible irony)! My very first kudos must go to Chris Pine's portrayal as Captain James T. Kirk. I personally think that Pine was the true acting standout in this highly engrossing film. While in the first film, Pine's Kirk was a raging, hormonal hellion cadet, in this one, Kirk is actually given layers as the very young Captain of the Starship Enterprise, and we can literally see Kirk evolve throughout the course of the film both personally and professionally. While the first film was almost more of an ensemble, in this one, I felt that Kirk was the star, with everyone else supporting. Back from the first film are the other famous original series characters played by the same actors: Zachary Quinto (as Spock), Karl Urban (as McCoy), Zoe Saldana (as Uhura), John Cho (as Sulu), Anton Yelchin (as Chekov), and in particular Simon Pegg (as Scotty) all fit well into their respective roles and continue to be impressive.The plot of STID starts with a mysterious figure named John Harrison (played with unapologetic coldness by Benedict Cumberbatch) blackmailing a London Starfleet operative into bombing the secret Section 31 facility in exchange for Harrison giving the man the cure that will save his cancer-stricken daughter's life. After the bombing, the head of Starfleet, Admiral Marcus (excellently played by veteran Peter Weller in an overdue welcome back!) convenes all of Starfleets Captains and First Officers into an emergency meeting and reveals that Harrison, a genetically engineered man with high intellect and superhuman strength, was an agent of Section 31, whose purpose was to develop advanced weaponry in anticipation of future conflicts. But then Harrison went rogue. During the meeting, Kirk (recently demoted to First Officer after violating the Prime Directive at the film's outset) tells the re-instated Enterprise leader Admiral Pike (wonderfully reprised by veteran actor Bruce Greenwood) as well as the rest of the convened that he thinks Harrison has set them up, which comes to fruition as Harrison attacks the meeting, and in the process kills Admiral Pike.Admiral Marcus re-instates Kirk as Enterprise Captain and tasks him on an off-the-books mission to pursue Harrison across the neutral zone into an unpopulated location on the Klingon homeworld Kronos where Harrison is hiding out. As part of Kirk's unofficial orders, he is to use 72 torpedoes on Harrison to take him out. For this special mission, The Enterprise also takes on another science officer, the Admiral's daughter Dr. Carol Marcus (winningly played by the sexy Alice Eve), who is a weapons specialist in charge of maintaining and surveying the torpedoes. Long-time Trekkies know exactly who Carol Marcus is destined to be as she and Kirk have instant chemistry! With some goading by Spock, a bloodthirsty and vengeful Kirk opts to spare Harrison and bring him back to face trial for his murderous actions. While prisoner on board the Enterprise, Harrison reveals a couple of major secrets to Kirk: that Admiral Marcus has ulterior motives and of Harrison's true identity, both of which set the stage for an exciting second half! Although this sequel has it's share of exciting action, courtesy of maverick J.J. Abrams, much like the first film, it is all accentuated by deeper, richer characterization and interactions between the principals, especially Pine and Cumberbatch, who play well off each other. While Cumberbatch plays the primary bad guy with relish, Weller makes for a great secondary villain. Younger audiences might not know this, but Weller actually used to play mostly villainous roles in the early 80s in his pre-Robocop days! There are also several wonderful scenes between Pine and Quinto, foreshadowing the complicated and legendary Kirk-Spock friendship from TOS.And although the characterization is key, the film really boasts some eye-popping special effects and several exciting action sequences, including the thrilling underwater sequence that jumpstarts the film, an invigorating space-jump sequence at past the halfway point, and both a dizzying gravity-defying sequence and a pulse-pounding mano-y-mano fight in the climax. Even more so than the first film, this superior sequel makes me yearn for even more Trek!",10,2,6,20 April 2014
12 Angry Men," Watch it virtually EVERY time it's on!
","1957! I've said it before and I'll say it again: What a year for FILMS! PATHS OF GLORY, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, 12 ANGRY MEN, possibly the best of the lot. BRIDGE won Best Pic, but personally, I would have given the award to either PATHS OF GLORY or this film, 12 ANGRY MEN. They are the only two films of the lot that I think are truly perfect. I've said that I would give PATHS an 11 if I could and same goes for 12 ANGRY MEN. It's hard to believe this was a director's film DEBUT! That's right, this is the FIRST film directed by the great Sidney Lumet, and perhaps his best. I'd say it is.12 ANGRY MEN is the most simplistic of tales: 12 jurors must decide the fate of a teen accused of killing his father. The entire film consists of these men deliberating, debating, conjecturing, and learning about the case. In the process, we the viewer get a valuable lesson in LAW 101. You'll learn more about the law and legal system in this 2-hour exercise than in any 100 episodes of LAW AND ORDER. So simple, so true. The film is so flawless in it's presentation that you swear that the entire 2 hours is one long tracking shot of the 12 men in the room.The film stars the great Henry Fonda (as Juror #8) as the lone juror who finds the defendant NOT GUILTY. Fonda must convince the other 11 men that the teen is possibly innocent, that there is a REASONABLE DOUBT. The process through which he does this drives the film and is enthralling from start to finish. As the film progresses, you learn about each juror and what makes him tick. The other 11 jurors numbers 1-7 and 9-12 are, respectively: Martin Balsam, William Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber. All actors are brilliant. Can't see an ounce of acting of showmanship in the entire film.I watch 12 ANGRY MEN virtually every time it airs and never feel like I've wasted my time. Now that's a great film!",10,0,0,1 September 2008
Us," Dumb, terrible film
","As someone who thought Jordan Peele's Get Out was somewhat overrated (Best Picture nominee? I don't think so), compared to the atrocity that is US, it in addition to about a million other movies, is a masterpiece! Sorry, but Us is just pure idiocy. Subterranean doppelgangers? The mere idea is silly. And the twist was pretty obvious from the beginning. I'm finding an increasing problem of really bad pacing in a lot of modern movies. Us moves at a fast pace, but it's too fast. It just jumps right to the action without any character development for Adelaide, her family or their friends. Red and her exposition speech was obnoxious storytelling. Talk about spoon-feeding the viewer.Although the adult characters were decent enough with their performances, especially award-winning actresses N'yong and Moss, the kids were annoying. The daughter always had this stupid look on her face and the son barely spoke. And the comedy bits in this were incredibly ill-timed and unfunny. That part where the family argued about who killed the most Tethers was the most cringe exchange I've seen in a movie this year and I've seen my share of films in theatres. The father and that performance art line? Ugh! And the movie should have been over at the 30-minute mark, but nope, let's killer talk the family and let them get away ON PURPOSE so they can deus ex machina their way to surviving.Between this putrid piece and Peele's recent incredibly mediocre Twilight Zone reboot, I think Get Out was his 1-hit wonder. This mind-numbing mess is still above a 7 on this site, yet Curse of La Llorona, a genuinely frightful and entertaining horror flick is like 5.5? I guess Oscar-winning movies make fans give the director's next project an automatic pass, despite it being trash. And Us is trash!",1,1,5,6 June 2019
Spider-Man 2," Tedious, overblown, boring sequel
","MORE and BIGGER is not necessarily BETTER! I actually enjoyed the first SPIDERMAN (2002) with its simple, focused story of Peter Parker (played soundly and solidly by Tobey Maguire) bitten by a radioactive spider and discovering that he had unusual abilities to shoot webs from his wrists, scale buildings, and sense things! The characters were fresh and interesting, the villain (Green Goblin) was cool and the film moved at a leisurely pace.Here comes the sequel SPIDERMAN 2 (2004)! And OF COURSE the masses fall for all the hype, the multitude of characters, the longer running time, etc! But this flick is just plain BORING! In SPIDERMAN, the filmmakers so eloquently and effectively showed us Peter Parker's pain and shock as his selfishness inadvertently led to his uncle's death. THEN, they had to try to one-up themselves by having a super sad, annoying scene in SPIDEY 2 where Peter (again played by Maguire) tells his aunt that he was responsible. That scene was Hollywood Manipulation 101! The point of the first one was that Peter was a kid (a high schooler for cripe's sake!) with no goals, no direction, no maturity. And I hated his aunt's reaction. To shun him like that for not getting involved in what was rightfully a police matter. Last time I looked, Spiderman was not impervious to bullets! He could have been killed. Did not fool me with that one! Also, the object of Peter's affection...Miss Mary Jane Rotten Bottom (Kirsten Dunst)...is a WHORE! That's right, a SLUT! She went from Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was just using her to get back at Peter in SPIDERMAN to Jameson's nephew (or son or whatever) in this movie. So she goes from Peter's best friend to Peter's boss's son (or nephew or whatever). THIS easy chick is the object of his desire? And that J.K. Simmons as Jameson is annoying as heck and NOT funny... and he's the comic relief! More like comic refuse! And there's the obligatory population of useless extras who add NOTHING to the proceedings but to scream and screech and be wowed by Spidey's abilities...It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Spiderloser!And they had this one scene where Harry slaps Peter at a party in front of a bunch of people...What? And Peter just stood there and took it! I'd have taken my chances with the spoiled millionaire and hit his tail back! Or at least sued him! May be a hero, but Peter's still a MAN! This sleaze basically stole the woman meant to be your girlfriend in the first movie and you let him get away with this? C'mon, Petey! But the biggest travesty was this part where Peter temporarily loses his powers and have this extended sequence where Peter is blissfully free and human again and they play RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN ON MY HEAD!...I repeat...they play RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN ON MY HEAD! Reason #1 any human being can say this film sucks!Of course, there is the perfunctory special effects extravaganza! But it's all show and is much too hard to believe. The villain is Dr. Ock (Alfred Molina), who's ticked about something (aren't they all?) so he plans revenge on the city of, New York, is it? At least this is New York as New York and not Chicago as Gotham City! See the multi-armed CGI villain octopus his way through New York...see Spidey shoot webs endless webs miles and miles...see Peter pine for Mary Jane...see Mary Jane act like a mindless idiot for not knowing this guy is obsessed with her ass...YAWN!",1,20,44,29 October 2009
Batman Returns," A real classic!
","I remember really liking BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think that this is the best of all the Batman movies (even over Christopher Nolan's terrific 2005 BATMAN BEGINS and definitely over the seriously over-hyped overrated 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remember thinking that the 1st BATMAN w/ Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love it). But I think that this movie really hits the nail on the head. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck) are all vivid and memorable. You really get to see what Batman/Bruce Wayne is all about in Keaton's terrific characterization. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the up-and-coming Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen top honors from Keaton had his character not been destroyed by Nolan's hack film-making in TDK !. Danny DeVito as The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious, and lethal. DeVito is great and doesn't need scenery-chewing to give great performance like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can actually sympathize with this disfigured outcast and his plight to fit into normal society. I had never really been big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this film, but this is definitely my favorite performance of hers. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is goofy and odd at first, then when she is transformed into Catwoman, she is simultaneously sexy and scary, a total deadly sexpot! Also, I feel that Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken!BATMAN RETURNS, more so than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is assured film-making from beginning to end. The way Burton introduces the Penguin's heartbreaking backstory grabs you from the very beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite beginnings to any film: Danny Elfman's music sets an ominous foreboding tone that defines the rest of the film. It is a modification from the original BATMAN and a great one!Then flash forward 33 years to the present day Gotham and we are introduced to powerful businessman Shreck who wants to build new power plant in Gotham. During same scene we meet Shreck's meek, bullied, under-confident secretary Selina Kyle. And not long after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as Batman must battle The Penguin's Red Triangle Gang, a fun yet lethal group of outcasts and circus performers. Penguin sets plan in motion to attack the Gotham Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck in the chaos, and force him to help re-introduce him to society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and so he 'kills' her by shoving her out his high-rise office, then she is revived by cats. Sound convoluted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to be posing a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that things like this can happen, a dark, noirish world comprised of mistreated, deformed outcasts who deep down only want acceptance and to fit in. Confident storytelling if you ask me!The action scenes are few and far in between, but they are all exciting, entertaining, and nail-biting. They aren't there just for show, the way some in BATMAN are. And they all make sense. The climactic scene with Penguin's 'army' marching into the center of Gotham with Batman zoning in on Penguin's hideout and sidekick butler Alfred (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) assisting Batman is succinct, solid, heart-pounding fun!I also love the Christmastime, wintry setting, which adds to the super-dark, cold feel of Burton's Batman world. I also love the way Burton slowly introduces to us the Batman 'toys' without shoving them down our throats. Each 'toy' is appropriate for that moment in the film and we are compelled to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a funny film. DeVito's Penguin has many funny lines. So does Walken's Shreck. The Batman-Catwoman exchanges are extremely stimulating and humor-filled as well! A great ensemble! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a tightly woven tale of the dark forces at play in Tim Burton's fun, comic book world.",10,7,17,3 March 2008
Hot Fuzz," A fun-filled, hilarious, joyride of an action film
","HOT FUZZ is one the most entertaining film experiences that I've had in YEARS! This is probably the most enjoyable film I've seen since COLLATERAL. And it's a British film, most of which I find heavy-handed and boring! But not this one! It's actually extremely difficult to put this film into just one category: cop film, action, mystery, comedy, drama, parody, homage? It's actually all of these things and much more. As parody/homage, it definitely has elements of a lot of other 'old' action movies in it: LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD, BAD BOYS II (they constantly reference this film along with POINT BREAK), and guess what? There's also a big-time homage to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS at the beginning of the film's spectacular climax! HOT FUZZ tells the story of London supercop Constable Nicholas Angel (played brilliantly by Simon Pegg). Angel is one baaaad man! He has a ridiculously high arrest rate and is in top physical and mental shape. But his cronies in the London police are jealous of his success b/c he is as the London Chief Inspector says 'making them all look bad'. So Angel is transferred to the small, quiet English burg of Sandford. The head of Sandford's police force, Inspector Frank Butterman (played by Jim Broadbent in a lively, funny performance) assures Angel that nothing ever goes on in Sandford and that there hasn't been a murder or major case in 20 years! Of course, Angel, ever the suspicious and dedicated cop, immediately finds trouble in virtually EVERY situation. There are times in the film where you actually believe that Angel is actually paranoid b/c of his anal personality, even though you know that he is indeed right: there's SOMETHING wrong in Sandford! We constantly see right before several 'accidents' a mysterious hooded figure murdering prominent town citizens. Angel's partner is Constable Danny Butterman (played by Nick Frost in a hilarious and moving performance). Danny is the Inspector's son and is only interested in screwing off watching action movies and eating ice cream and cake! Angel and Danny's relationship is at the core of the film and is truly one of the best buddy relationships that I've ever seen in film. They are complete opposites, yet they complement each other to perfection. And both men learn things from each other. Danny learns how to be a much better cop and Angel learns how to take it down a notch and appreciate the finer things in life. Angel and Danny's police cohorts are Constables Tony Fisher, Doris Thatcher, Bob Walker, Sergeant Turner, and the 2 Andys (played hilariously by Kevin Eldon, Olivia Colman, Karl Johnson, Bill Bailey, Paddy Considine, and Rafe Spall). They are all just as apathetic to what is going on in Sandford as Danny.The film sports a great cast of quirky characters that, along with Inspector Butterman, comprise the town's NWA (for Neighborhood Watch Alliance) played brilliantly by veteran actors: grocery store magnate Simon Skinner (one of the former JAMES BONDs Timothy Dalton), surveillance expert Tom Weaver (THE EQUALIZER Edward Woodward), the bicycling schoolmarm Amanda Paver (Lorraine Hilton), Dr. Hatcher (Stuart Wilson), hotel owner Joyce Cooper (Billie Whitelaw), pub owners Roy and Mary Porter (Peter Wright and Julia Deakin), Rev. Shooter (Paul Freeman), candy shop owner Annette Roper (Patricia Franklin), local farmer James Reaper (Kenneth Cranham), and flower shop owner Leslie Tiller (Anne Reid).I accidentally came across HOT FUZZ while channel-flipping and luckily caught essentially the first 10 minutes of real dialogue of the film (the part right after the obligatory opening introduction and backstory of our hero Angel that I saw upon 2nd viewing). This 10-minute pair of scenes in the London police station where Angel's superiors are telling him they are transferring him and Angel at the crime scene with his ex-girlfriend Jeanine (who I later found out was Cate Blanchett in that body-covering getup) had me laughing hysterically and so I thought I'd stick around to see how this movie was going to turn out. I was sure the film was a comedy by this first 10 minutes, but when I checked the menu description of it, it said it was Action/Adventure and I went 'Huh?' I don't think the real action came until the last 30 minutes of the film, but along the way, I was laughing constantly and thoroughly engaged also by the mystery element and quirkiness of the film. I think that there were at least 5 or 6 times where I was sure that they were at the end of the film and I was completely fooled and then there was another hitch. And it was all worth it! For me, this film is really a great tip-of-the-hat to all the over-the-top action movies of the past 20 years or so. It simultaneously mocks those films while paying playful homage to them. And the key word is FUNNY. You will laugh throughout! This is truly one of the very few films in this decade of the 2000s (came out in 2007) that I've enjoyed from beginning to end! A great achievement!",10,18,27,10 May 2008
Ed Wood," Burton AND Depp's best!.....The best film of 1994!
","I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton's early films (both Batmans he directed, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands). I think his early work had an imagination and timeless appeal that, frankly, his later films have utterly lacked. And the genius of Tim Burton's early work culminated in what I believe to be his true best film ED WOOD (1994). If Tim Burton were ever going to win an Oscar as Best Director for his early work, this should have been the film. And it also boasts what I think is the BEST performance of the iconic Johnny Depp's career. Depp was totally robbed of a Best Actor nomination (and had he been, HE would have been my pick for the award!).Also, ED WOOD was the BEST film of 1994! Not Forrest Gump (which won and is way too schmaltzy and sentimental for my taste)...Not Shawshank Redemption (which was nominated for Best Pic, but has way too high a rating here on IMDb! #1 of all time? Are you freakin kidding me?)....Not Pulp Fiction (also nominated for Best Pic, but has dated too much for my taste and isn't even Tarantino's best film IMHO!)...Nope, ED WOOD should have been nominated and WON Best Picture of 1994! ED WOOD is Burton's tribute to the titular filmmaker who is widely regarded as the worst of all time. And a brilliant tribute it is! Burton basically goes for the purely comic approach, with touches of pathos and reality checks thrown in for good measure. Depp's awesome, energetic, all-in performance drives the film. He stays in character for the entirety of the film and this is one of the funniest performances of any male lead in a comedy film.Martin Landau was absolutely brilliant and on-key as horror film icon Bela Lugosi. Landau totally deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Rarely do I think they get those awards right, but they sure did in this case. It's just a shame that Burton, Depp, and the film didn't get their due as well.In addition to Depp and Landau, the supporting cast is wonderful: Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed's uptight first girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as Ed's true soulmate, Lisa Marie's uncanny Vampira impersonation, and the great Bill Murray as one of Ed's eccentric (was there any other kind with this man?) collaborators.Shot in black-and-white to give the film an old-school vibe and to mimic the era of film of Ed Wood's prime, the film plays like a parody of a parody. Certainly, the situations that Wood encountered didn't come across as THIS hysterical, but I think this is Burton's way of honoring the auteur, while still entertaining the general movie-going audience.Brilliant, funny film...Burton's best...Depp's best...One of THE best!",10,3,3,31 December 2011
Terminator Salvation," Extremely slow, loud, tedious flick
","If TERMINATOR SALVATION (2009) is not the worst of the Terminator franchise, then I don't know what is! To call this movie 'meandering' would be a gross understatement. What exactly was this film about? OK, there are 2 basic interconnected plot points, both of which get established early. First is that the Resistance Command (located in a submarine!) has SOMEHOW found a way to control the machines through a short-wave signal. Second is that during the interception of the signal, the Command also found out that Skynet's main targets are high-level soldier John Connor (Christian Bale) and teen-aged freedom fighter Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John's father that he must send back so that he can exist and save humanity.The FIRST thing I queried was WHEN AND HOW DID SKYNET FIND OUT THAT KYLE IS JOHN'S FATHER?! This was something that only Sarah Connor knew! And John only found out through the tapes she left him (how they were still playable after 34 years is another story!) and there's no way John would stupidly reveal this information...OOPS...He DID halfway through the movie, but NOT at any point before in the previous 3 films was this major factoid revealed...So, again, HOW AND WHEN DID SKYNET FIND OUT?!Back to the former plot point...Other than in a scene stolen directly from TRANSFORMERS, I don't think the signal was ever used on the Skynet robots! Speaking of that ripped-off TRANSFORMERS scene, there were many such scenes like this that are obvious ripoffs from big summer movies. I'm not talking about standard formulaic tricks that virtually ALL summer action movies employ; I'm talking about DIRECT, BLATANT RIPOFFS! The main offense is that Bale, for some inexplicable reason, used his raspy, annoying Batman voice from THE DARK KNIGHT to enunciate most of John Connor's dialog! It was painful to listen to. To add to it, they had a scene late in the movie where Bale stole one of Skynet's machine-operated motorcycles, then raced down the highway towards Skynet in a moment reminiscent of his racing down the streets of 'Gotham' in TDK. I think I even heard some of the TDK soundtrack in there somewhere. So TS blatantly ripped from two RECENT summer blockbuster movies, neither of which should even exist in the Terminator universe, and one of which was made just a freakin year before it AND starred TS's main actor! Unbelievable.TS was obviously meant to be a 'serious' movie. But it was more of just a downbeat, tiresome experience. I understand that the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse should be downbeat. Yet everything in the movie felt like a contrivance or a convenience to suit the purposes of the movie. And the surprise revelation late in the movie was a BIG stretch, the genesis of which made no sense. It was really just a silly way to explain away everything, not some slick or brilliant twist. Actually, Bale shares lead duties with Sam Worthington (who plays holocaust survivor Marcus Wright). While the more experienced Bale is borderline terrible in TS, Worthington gives a decent performance to counter Bale's monosyllabic grunting and theatrics. I found Wright's story more interesting than Connor's in this, but it had too many cliché moments and scenes to be taken seriously. Marcus' story being the primary one needs to be involving, but it is told in a linear, predictable manner with scenes of EVERY character he comes across seeing the 'good' inside him and eventually trusting him with no real basis or provocation. Other than the ho-hum dialog, there is random, uninvolving, unexciting action mainly to show off all the different styles of Terminators out there, including one that looks like a Transformer...Yikes! TS is actually more reminiscent of bleak apocalypse movies like the MAD MAX films than it is the TERMINATOR franchise as none of the colorful, nightmare-noirish, futuristic scenes we got a glimpse of in the first 3 movies is evident at all in TS. Just pale, drab-looking daylight scenes. Did they change the future that much in T2?Including the stars Bale and Worthington, none of the supporting characters leave any kind of real impression, with the exception of Yelchin's good performance as Kyle Reese, the only character that rises above the material. Also, I strangely didn't find that little girl that was with Kyle all the time too annoying; usually, little kids are the death knell of many a good movie (and that includes Edward Furlong's annoying, overrated rendition of John Connor in T2!). But she was apparently mute or either just chose not to speak, so that helped! The two adult female characters Kate Brewster (Bryce Howard) and Blair (Moon Bloodgood) are there OBVIOUSLY just for eye candy! There's even a gratuitous scene where Blair goes topless to seduce Marcus which felt really unnecessary.In reality, TS doesn't even feel like a Terminator movie at all, just a loud, contrived, humorless summer action movie. TS also has a lot of moments where the heroes (esp. Bale) just yell out, sometimes for no apparent reason! Interestingly, Bale in one of his interviews after TS premiered said that he wanted to do a film that stayed faithful to the Terminator franchise, which was fine, but he went on to say that T1 and T2 were basically great films (won't get many arguments there), but he essentially trashed T3 saying it was unfaithful to the franchise. Guess what, though, Bale?...Contrary to the opinion of way too many so-called Terminator fans, T3 was actually a well-written and acted, provocative, fluid, exciting action movie that WAS faithful to Terminator; and even if it was not faithful to it (I think that it was), it still is a darn entertaining watch DESPITE being labeled a Terminator movie...But the movie that you were hyping and this movie I'm reviewing, TS, is NONE of those things (Terminator flick or not) and a serious contender for worst summer movie of the decade...The irony!",2,1,4,11 May 2010
Juno," Interesting, quirky film, but shouldn't have been an Oscar contender
","I'll admit it. I typically don't like films like JUNO. Supposedly an independent flick (feels more like typical Hollywood fare to me), it tells the 9-month story of precocious, 'adult' teenager Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page in an impressive performance for a young actress), who on an urge to have sex, accidentally gets impregnated by too-young-to-know any-better Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, who really annoyed me whenever he was on screen). I've got to say, that while I enjoyed JUNO a tad more than I thought I would, I absolutely hated the seemingly surprise ending of Juno deciding she loves this loser! I was kind of OK with the flick until it took this U-turn. This is the main part I hate about the film: Juno loves THIS guy? He's an uber-teen who doesn't know a damn thing about anything! And the film actually has the nerve to portray the unexpected pregnancy as if it is all Juno's fault! Bleeker never tells his mother and gets away scot free! And he had the nerve to go off on her and make it seem like it was all her fault and never took ANY responsibility for his own actions. This ticked me off to no end! Well, the film's plusses (which are few and far between) include some fine supporting work by Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons as Juno's stepmom and father, but I thought the best performances of the film really belonged to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner (as prospective adoptive parents Mark and Vanessa Loring). Their storyline spoke to me much more than Juno's scattershot storyline, which I don't think was well done at all. All her folks and friend does are make snide comments and jokes about this pregnancy. This is not supposed to be a laugh-out-loud comedy, but the early finding-out-your-pregnant-having-to-tell-your-parents-dialogue is really played for pure laughs, which for the most part, are not that funny.Diablo Cody was wrongly given the original screenplay Oscar for this rather juvenile script (no pun intended). It all felt like a gimmick to me when she won on Oscar night. I've always thought the Academy has given this award in particular to the more POPULAR than deserving choice, to kind of lighten up the evening (like when they gave it to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for GOOD WILL HUNTING) to see what kind of antics would ensue. Let's give the award to the scantily-clad, tattooed former stripper and see what happens! THIS is why the Oscars should not be taken seriously!",5,1,4,20 January 2009
L.A. Confidential," Labyrinthine tale that showcased stars-in-the-making
","1997 was a year of great movies that introduced some major Hollywood newcomers and talent. There was Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (TITANIC), Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore (BOOGIE NIGHTS), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (GOOD WILL HUNTING), and then there's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, which may perhaps have boasted the best, up and coming talent of all b/c its stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce, collectively went on to do much bigger things, although the stars in those other films didn't do too badly either. Spacey had just won Supporting Oscar for THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but he would go on to win the big one (Best Actor for American BEAUTY). Crowe went on to get 3 consecutive Best Actor noms for THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR (won), and A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Pearce went on to star in the highly acclaimed film MEMENTO. Of course the biggest instant winner from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL itself was Kim Basinger, who won Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in this film.L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is an enthralling, elaborate, complex tale about 3 cops in circa 1953 Los Angeles. Jack Vincennes (Spacey), Bud White (Crowe), and Ed Exley (Pearce) are embroiled in 'separate' cases which all somehow tie in together with discoveries of big time collusion and corruption at the end of the rainbow. The 3 cops couldn't be more different from each other. Vincennes is a 'soft' cop who uses it as a cover for his real interest in becoming a big Hollywood star (he is the cop adviser for a 1950s TV show about cops). White is a hardcore, gritty, tough-as-nails 'dirty' cop who is willing to bend the rules to take down criminals. Exley is a clean-cut, idealistic rookie who wants to do everything above board and also despises cops like White, who he sees as inferior to him. And White hates Exley b/c he got his partner Dick Stensland fired from the force for his major part in an altercation with prisoners at the jailhouse early in the film.Early in the film, there is a brutal mass murder at a city diner and one of the victims is Stensland (who we find out later is much dirtier than White ever was). Separately, White and Exley investigate the crime. White's lead is the fact that one of the diner victims was a young girl that he had seen a few nights before when he and Stensland were out on patrol; the girl was in a car with Pierce Patchett (a big Hollywood flesh king played by David Stathairn) and Lynn Bracken (one of Patchett's ladies of the evening played by the aforementioned Basinger, who is incredibly gorgeous and sexy here, but with a real maturity and edge, perhaps b/c she is actually somewhat older in real life than they made her appear in this film). White goes to see Bracken, supposedly just for the case, but there was immediate attraction between the 2 when they first met and it carries over to this second purposeful meeting at her home. The exchange between Crowe and Basinger in this scene is one of the best in the film.Exley works with Vincennes as his partner on the case. Even though they don't particularly like each other, Exley and Vincennes both have similar goals in solving the case: Exley for career advancement and Vincennes for more media attention. Initially, 3 young black men are arrested and pegged for the crime, but the 3 cops all know better than that, and so Exley and White, again separately, investigate further; later Exley convinces Vincennes to help him b/c it may tie in w/ another case that he is working on of a murdered young naive Hollywood wannabe actor that he met through his sleazy newspaper ally Sid Hudgens (played by Danny DeVito in winning, lighthearted performance).Needless to say, the film gains in complexity, drama, and suspense as it moves along and eventually the 2 real main characters (Exley and White) converge to tie everything together and then work together to bring down the real bad guys. The beauty of these characters is in the fact that nothing is cut and dried about them. They both have major flaws in them that prevent them from being complete cops, so they need to learn from each other to become better cops. When they get together, they actually complement each other the way that 2 'partners' should and in the process learn that not all people are what they really seem like on the surface.The irony of the film is that even though the plot is remarkably complex, it is not that hard to follow once everything is tied together. Of course the acting is top-notch. Crowe, Pearce, and Spacey are all terrific and imbibe their characters with energy, depth, and complexity. It's easy to see how all 3 went on to great things. Special mention should also go to the great James Cromwell, who plays the cops' police commander; he always gives a reliable performance and is important to the plot as well.LA CONFIDENTIAL was directed by Curtis Hanson, who did another favorite film of mine BAD INFLUENCE much earlier than this one and you can see from both films that he has an eye for style and glamour which shines through in this film. The film nails down the 50s look, sets, and props, but is so rich in character detail and plot that you look past the surface, so that LA CONFIDENTIAL is not just some period piece film. It is a major Hollywood production done to technical perfection with some serious heart.",10,1,2,30 March 2008
The Terminator," A real masterpiece
","Recently, I was listening to a discussion about filmmakers and the person leading the talk explained why he thinks that their best films (even the best directors) are usually their first ones or early ones and the explanation was amazingly simple...It boils down to this...'The director has his/her personal vision that they've always wanted to translate to the screen, the studios don't really know what to make of the film b/c it's so original, so they take a chance thinking the director will tank, but then the film's originality wins out.' With minimal studio involvement or interference, a filmmaker with a great idea that is perfectly executed can put out a masterpiece straight away...And that's what James Cameron did with THE TERMINATOR! THE TERMINATOR (1984) is one of Cameron's earliest films, and to me, it is still to this day his BEST film! I hear and read all the time of so many people fawning all over T2:JUDGMENT DAY as being superior to the original TERMINATOR, but I cannot disagree more. T2 is essentially a a loud summer 'action' movie with great effects and one-dimensional characters, whereas the original TERMINATOR is an amalgamation of sci-fi, horror, action (yes, there is that!), and is very forward-thinking in its premise: it dares to forewarn us about a bleak, apocalyptic future in a rather unsettling, plausible way. The way that THE TERMINATOR presents itself really does scare the heck out of me! I personally don't think any of Cameron's other films (including the heavily overrated ALIENS and T2) are in the vicinity of greatness that THE TERMINATOR is.THE TERMINATOR stars the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger in perhaps his greatest film performance. You can tell a performance is great when it still holds up after 20+ years! Schwarzenegger is truly confident, convincing, and terrifying as the T800, a killing machine from the future (2029) tasked to kill 'The Mother of the Future' Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton in a heartbreaking and powerful performance). Sarah is to be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the future resistance. John sends back one of his soldiers Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn in a provocative, convincing performance). Both Biehn and Schwarzenegger's characters truly come off as 'otherwordly', with no interest or use for the present day foibles and nonsense. These actors' authenticity as futuristic beings make THE TERMINATOR more than the typical sci-fi fare. To this day, I say that these 3 underrated performances of Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn, are among the best in the sci-fi genre.In addition to THE TERMINATOR having so much going for it as a multi-genre film, another thing I love about this over the sequels is that we actually don't see the pivotal character of John Connor. Of course, since he is still in the future, we can't see him, but it keeps the character a larger-than-life that we actually don't see him. Another big plus is that in addition to the main 3 actors, the supporting cast is exceptional: Paul Winfield as the skeptical police Lt. Traxler, Lance Henriksen as his wisecracking detective sidekick, and most notably Earl Boen as psychiatrist Dr. Silberman, who is equally fascinated and mocking of Reese's story of an apocalyptic future.As previously mentioned, Cameron impressively mixes several genres well into this groundbreaking film. It spawned a lot of wannabes and you can see the influence on some of the later big 80s sci-fi movies like ALIENS, ROBOCOP, and THE HIDDEN. But THE TERMINATOR. But this film has an added 'bonus' of helplessness and hopelessness that permeates throughout. If Sarah Connor dies, then supposedly machines will take over the world. If Sarah Connor lives, then the world has a bleak future ahead of it fighting said machines.The last (and most important!) ingredient that makes THE TERMINATOR superior to it's sequels is in the title character. I'm actually a monumental fan of Schwarzenegger and most of his movies, and although he went the traditional action star route cashing in on his star-making role here (Cameron even made Arnie the 'good guy' terminator in the sequels!), he can claim to bringing to the screen the most terrifying, remorseless killing machine in the history of cinema!",10,1,2,22 March 2010
Final Destination 2," FD2 is my favorite FD sequel!
","Film franchises have become a sort of curiosity for me. Like how a new film concept comes out with an original idea and somehow it blossoms into a popular series. The Saw movies are the first ones I noticed this happening with, where the first movie was so beloved and such a surprise hit that it demanded a flurry of sequels. Harry Potter and Twilight seemed more like 'planned' franchises, while Saw was a surprise. In the vein of Saw is the FINAL DESTINATION series of movies, of which I find a major guilty pleasure! While I still think the first one is the best, I really enjoyed this 2nd film in the series FINAL DESTINATION 2 (2003), which ironically seems to be overlooked amongst the sequels, but favor it over 3, 4, or 5, actually.The first FD had a creepy horror movie gravitas that still to this day makes it the best of the series that really none of the sequels have been able to emulate. I felt like FD3 was a bit too serious and except for the leads, none of the other characters involved me like in FD1. FD4 was pure parody and juvenile, but still oddly entertaining in it's awfulness! FD5 was actually very good and I might put that one right behind FD2. I like FD2 mainly because I think it does the best job of capturing the spirit of the original FD, while having a welcome sense of humor and a wonderful ensemble cast with a lot of personality! I think of all the FD movies, I actually like the FD2 ensemble the best!The leads A.J. Cook, Michael Landes, and Ali Larter (from FD1) are engaging, with Larter's presence tying things together nicely between FD1 and FD2. Cook and Larter are very personable (and extremely attractive!), while Landes is stalwart and reliable. The supporting cast steals the show, though! Jonathan Cherry (as dimwitted dope addict Rory), Keegan Connor Tracy (as vain, vampy businesswoman Kat), T.C. Carson (as wisecracking non-believer Eugene), James Kirk (as teenager Tim), Lynda Boyd (as Tim's mom) are all likable characters that I find myself rooting for even though I know what's in store for them! FD2 kind of sets the stage for all other sequels being more action-oriented than the original. The series became more about characters trying to beat death than accepting their fate or just generally being creeped out, like they were in FD1. Of course, the iconic Tony Todd makes another appearance as the caretaker from hell! The first half sets the stage, while the second half really gets going when the ensemble must converge to beat death. Highly entertaining sequel!",8,2,2,14 April 2012
Alien," Sci fi horror classic!
","ALIEN (1979) is a film that I overlooked back in the day. In the 80s the decade where I really started to see a lot of movies and could process them, sci-fi movies were mostly action vehicles, even some of the best of the decade (The Terminator, Robocop, Predator, The Hidden), but each remains watchable because they all have wonderful characterizations, memorable dialogue, and most importantly a provocative story that underlied the action. The irony is the perhaps the most revered sci- fi action movie of the 80s was 'Aliens', which is the 'sequel' to this movie that I'm reviewing. Sadly, 'Aliens' is rated higher on this site than those aforementioned superior sci-fi movies and the SAME rating as this movie, it's predecessor 'Alien', which is by leaps and bounds much better. 'Aliens' is a hamburger with Coca-Cola, while 'Alien' is steak with red wine! The film sports an absolutely superb cast: Tom Skerritt (Captain Dallas), Sigourney Weaver (Ripley, second officer), Ian Holm (Ash, medical officer), Veronica Cartwright (Lambert, communications), John Hurt (Kane, first officer), Yaphet Kotto (Parker, engineer), and Harry Dean Stanton (Brett,technician), all who inhabit their characters convincingly. The actors play well off each other, with their interactions never seeming forced.Directed by innovator Ridley Scott, 'Alien' is actually a feasible representation of the future. Set around the mid-22nd century, this tight, linear tale begins as a mining ship, the Nostromo, is in deep space with it's crew in hibernation on it's way back to Earth with a wealth of mineral ore. The crew works for the Weyland Corporation, who owns the ship. A distress call from a relatively nearby planet forces the ship's computer to wake up the crew and they go to begrudgingly investigate. The trio Dallas, Lambert, Kane go on a search party to find an alien ship with it's long-dead pilot and a collection of large eggs, one of which bursts open and a 'face-hugging' creature attaches itself to Kane.The special effects, everything from the ship design to the planet settings, are still very eye-popping and believable to this day. Nothing over-the-top or dated. One can imagine something like this happening, which is scary! In particular, the effects of the alien remain impressive, perhaps the best design of an alien creature in all of film history. The progression of the creature throughout the film from face-hugger to full-blown alien builds the tension and the crew's terror and horror is palpable. The film takes the 'less is more' approach to horror, by presenting the creature almost like a boogey-man, who pops out at you unexpectedly in your worst nightmares.In re-visiting this classic recently, I was surprised at how short the film's running time was to how I remembered it. I always thought of this movie as a very long film, but it's not really. Everything actually moves at a brisk pace, with the characters driving the story keeping us invested in their survival. And 'Alien' is the type of film that isn't just shoe-horned into one genre. It skillfully combines elements of sci-fi, horror, and drama. Superior in every way to it's sequels, 'Alien' is the real keeper of the franchise!",10,1,3,7 June 2014
Taxi Driver," A certified masterpiece of American cinema
","As highly regarded as Raging Bull is, I truly think that TAXI DRIVER is the greatest collaboration between Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro. There's just something raw, pure, and real about this film that gets to the core of humanity. A highly controversial film to this day, Taxi Driver packs a 100% emotional punch. Personally, this film makes my top 10 films of all time. It just has to b/c I can't imagine a top 10 w/o Scorcese and I believe this to be his greatest work.Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro in one of probably the 5 greatest film performances in history) is a workaholic, world-weary, insomniac, (slightly) deranged Vietnam war veteran who now drives cabs for a living in New York City, circa 1976, the year the film came out in theaters. Bickle sees the world through jaded eyes, mind, heart, body, and soul. Scorcese literally takes the viewer into Bickle's mind by using his actual thoughts to narrate the film. Through thoughts and looks, it appears that Travis is frustrated, angry, suspicious, lonely, and perhaps even racist. DeNiro masterfully conveys all these emotions and characteristics throughout the film.The film has 2 femme fatales: A politician's aide (played by an utterly fascinating and desirable blonde bombshell Cybill Shepherd) and a 12-year old prostitute (played by Jodie Foster in a performance that established this young actress as a major talent). As odd as it appears at first, you really understand what Bickle sees in these 2 females. They provide him with qualities that he otherwise doesn't possess. Shepherd makes him think that he could have a normal relationship with a woman and Foster taps into his paternal instincts. It's almost like he has an adopted family with these 2 females. Ironically, or not so much, these 2 'relationships' occur exclusive to each other b/c Bickle has real trouble connecting or staying connected to anyone for too long b/c of his not-so-great social skills. A lot of the 'conversations' and interactions that he has w/ these 2 women and other characters end up as incomplete or muddled, but this is the point: to illustrate that this man is himself an incomplete human being who desperately needs something or someone to make him believe in humanity and that he has a place in this world.There are quite a few minor characters in the film that only add to its humanity and brilliance: Albert Brooks as Shepherd's humorous political co-worker, Peter Boyle as Travis' fellow cab driver who he has a rather touching conversation w/ outside a café where the cabbies hang out, Harvey Keitel as Foster's 'Indian' pimp, and Mr. Martin Scorcese himself as one of Travis' fares, an angry husband who wants to commit a heinous act and relays all of it to Travis.DeNiro's character appears to spiral out of control as the film progresses and there are points it looks like he's going to literally explode before our very eyes. Then something will happen to reign it all in. The climax of the film is one of the most disturbing moments in all of film history. I won't spoil it, but it is violent, scary, gory, sad, and heartbreaking. And it is all b/c of Travis Bickle. You literally have become so involved w/ this man throughout the film that you feel his loneliness, bitterness, and pain in the end and knew it had to culminate to this. The real ending may surprise some, but it doesn't take away from the humanistic mastery of this film and of DeNiro's legendary performance.Scorcese has long said that Taxi Driver was inspired by the John Ford/John Wayne collaborative masterwork The Searchers. And I totally believe it b/c I've seen both films many times and understand the comparisons: A roaming, lonely, jaded, racist antihero 'searching' for something/someone in a dangerous, cruel, me-first world and doing this for mysterious reasons that is never really understood w/ a cast of memorable supporting characters to round out the action and the film. And as much as it is influenced by The Searchers, I still stand Taxi Driver out alone as influential in its own right.MASTERPIECE! CLASSIC! SUPERLATIVE! All of that.",10,1,2,25 March 2008
Glory," Perhaps the real Best Picture of 1989!
","How in the heck did GLORY not get nominated for Best Picture! A travesty! Note to Academy: Do SOMETHING right! GLORY is the engrossingly powerful re-enactment of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, a command of entirely African-American MEN during the Civil War, whose services were needed due to heavy losses by the Union Army. President Lincoln ordered the induction of black men into the Union to help turn the tide of the war. These men are freed slaves, escaped slaves, or already free men from the North. Just saw this film again recently and it holds up amazingly well 20 years later.GLORY stars Matthew Broderick in the role of a lifetime as Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the leader of this regiment. At first hesitant due to projected backlash of commanding a Negro regiment, Shaw agrees to do it. Broderick relays a real humanity in Shaw that helps carry the film to its inevitable conclusion. A vastly underrated performance where a bunch of so-called film critics complained that the film should have been about the soldiers more. But it was! While Shaw narrates the story, it manages not to make him the focus and allows the viewer to see the men through Shaw's eyes, which are non-prejudicial and objective eyes indeed! This is the genius of Broderick's performance: no sentimentality, but perfect doses of empathy, toughness, and clarity. Make no mistake: Broderick is not the star of GLORY, but without his performance, the film would not work as well as it does!Now to the soldiers: The great Morgan Freeman plays Rawlings a proud gravedigger who has seen just as much carnage as Shaw and meets him early in the film at Antietam. Both men sadly know what war is really all about. Freeman is underrated, too, as he emanates quiet dignity, but here I'm more impressed than by some of his bigger roles like in DRIVING MISS DAISY and SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Rawlings is a man's man in every sense.Then newcomer Andre Braugher is excellent as Thomas, the dignified friend of Col. Shaw, a free Bostonian black man who volunteers to be in Shaw's regiment. Jihmi Kennedy is heartbreakingly good as Jupiter, a sweet, yet slow man who is looking for dignity in a racist world himself. And of course Best Supporting Oscar winner Denzel Washington as runaway slave Tripp, all bluster and full of anger, hatred, and remorse. Washington's Oscar was well-deserved. As great as Washington is though, the rest of these actors are just as exceptional and should not be overshadowed. Additionally, Cary Elwes is extremely fine as Shaw's second in command and best friend Major Forbes.GLORY is one of the most emotional films that one will ever have the joy of seeing. And while the outcome is dire for these brave soldiers, the film is monumentally uplifting and never strays or gets plodding or sentimental. The building up of these men into real soldiers is powerful and at the end you see what war (sadly) is all about.Director Edward Zwick should forever be remembered for this triumph. It won 5 Oscars, but wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Absurd!",10,2,3,13 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," When CGI goes berserk!
","Not even an argument as far as I'm concerned, STAR WARS, EPISODE TWO: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is the absolute WORST of all 6 STAR WARS films! And, given it's budget, some of the actors in it, and just the fact that it is part of the STAR WARS saga itself, perhaps a contender for one of the worst films of all time, at least worst big-budget films.....Wow! And I remember when this first came out that a significant number of fans thought THIS was better than PHANTOM MENANCE...Nope! Not even close, actually. While MENACE has its share of sorry dialogue and characters (Jar Jar Binks!), it mostly benefited from mimicking the fast pacing of the original A NEW HOPE and has some exciting set pieces and moments (fast-paced opening, the pod race, climactic battle). The acting and dialogue in MENACE certainly wasn't spectacular, but it was way better than what we were served with in this clunker! But most importantly, the CGI effects of MENACE essentially did not detract from the film the way it does in CLONES.CLONES begins with the former Naboo Queen, now Senator, Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) being transported to the planet city Coruscant and and an assassination attempt occurs. Her stand-in is killed and so Senator Palpatine (Ian McDarmid) 'suggests' a Jedi escort/bodyguard for her protection. Of course, the duty goes to teenage Jedi-in-training Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen). Another attack occurs and so Anakin accompanies Padme to Naboo where the Senate and Jedi feel she will be safer. And thus, the Anakin-Padme romance begins! And that ain't good! A terribly realized, cringe-inducing set of interactions ensues and takes up a large portion of the film. I really don't blame the actors. The dialogue is atrocious. I don't think Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro could have looked better in this! Other stories include Anakin's Jedi Master Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) investigating the creation of a clone army on the faraway Kamino star system, and Jedi Masters/Council members Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) sensing a dark, ominous disturbance in the Force. All stories converge to a climactic battle on Geonosis, where the Jedi must battle a droid army led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), who is responsible for the attack on Padme's life.The worst offense of CLONES is the CGI! This film is at present the worst example of CGI use in today's movies. It is completely overdone and really cheesy-looking in a lot of places. I mean, it dominates the film! Yoda is CGI! Not good. The original trilogy demonstrated that you have to have a story. EMPIRE STRIKES BACK had the best story, and A NEW HOPE had an footloose, tongue-in-cheek appeal that more than made up for its minimal plot and story. RETURN OF THE JEDI, actually the weakest of the original 3, by plain default, feels like a masterpiece to CLONES! At least the characters were established from HOPE and EMPIRE by the time of JEDI and we could forgive the rather juvenile nature with which they concluded the original trilogy. The characters in CLONES, however, had never really been established in the fast-paced MENACE. And CGI so dominates CLONES, with no character development whatsoever, yet the film has exposition and dialogue all over the place! And in the end, the climactic battle is deathly boring and confusing. A bunch of Jedi fighting a bunch of battle Droids with a moment that made me cringe more than the Anakin-Padme scenes: when that worm-headed Jedi used his powers to knock C3PO down so he didn't have to participate in the fight and then gave him that weird smile (really eerie!). Trust me, it's a goofy moment! Then Yoda and the Clone army swoops in. And we are 'treated' to a terrible lightsaber duel where Obi-Wan and Anakin get their ass handed to them by a 100-year old Count Dooku! So CGI Yoda must save their young butts! Essentially, the same way that MENACE tried to mimic HOPE, so does CLONES try to mimic EMPIRE: Jedi-in-training Anakin gets trumped by the more powerful former-Jedi-turned-Sith Lord Dooku the way that Jedi-in-training Luke got beat by more powerful Darth Vader and both Anakin and Luke lost one of their hands in the battle (Anakin even lost a whole arm!). Anakin and Padme joined at the end of CLONES (with a noticeably pregnant Padme) the way their offspring Luke and Leia stood together at the end of EMPIRE. Also Anakin and Padme's budding romance in CLONES doubling for Han and Leia's romance in EMPIRE. Obi-Wan off by himself investigating Kamino the way Luke went off by himself to discover Yoda in the Dagobah system in EMPIRE. And of course, the ominous, open ending where we know a sequel is to come! Difference? We looked forward to the EMPIRE sequel wanting more, but with CLONES, we wished the entire movie experience could be taken back! Do-over, please!",1,12,24,6 August 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," Solid 2nd sequel to IDENTITY
","I loved THE BOURNE IDENTITY and think it's one of the top 10 films of the 2000s. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: not so much. I thought SUPREMACY was too herky jerky with all that fancy camera stuff and a rather boring story and dull villains, while IDENTITY kept it simple with a fresh, exciting chase story, an engaging hero and well-staged action sequences. Thankfully, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM returns to that form. It still has some of that fancy camera stuff like in SUPREMACY, but in ULTIMATUM, it works to much better effect. Seems like in SUPREMACY, the camera stuff was just done for show, while in ULTIMATUM, it helps drive the story along. And what a convoluted story it is! Our hero Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in another solid outing) is trying to find out 'where it all began'. He promises Marie's brother (don't remember him from either of the first 2 films) that he will get to the root of all this international intrigue. Bourne stumbles across an article by a British reporter Simon Ross (well played by Paddy Considine of HOT FUZZ fame) who, through an unknown source, outs Bourne and the CIA's covert Treadwell and Blackbriar operations. Bourne realizes that if he contacts Ross and find his source, who obviously is an CIA insider, he can find the men that recruited him to be a relentless assassin.The Bourne-Ross convergence contains one of the best sustained action sequences I've ever seen in any film, where Bourne constantly eludes his CIA chasers through the London streets, subways, and shops and after putting a prepaid phone in Ross' bag, talks Ross through the chase. Really exciting opening act! The head CIA guy after Bourne here is New York CIA anti-terrorist chief Noah Vosen (played by the great David Strathairn in a slick, lethal performance). In to assist Vosen is of course SUPREMACY's Pamela Landy (the classy Joan Allen in an underused, thankless role). Allen makes the most of what she has to work with here, which isn't much.Both Bourne and Vosen simultaneously figure out the leak and have separate agendas for wanting to find him: Bourne to find his original tormentors that turned him into a killer and Vosen to eliminate the leak and thus any trace of the torture tactics used by Treadwell/Blackbriar. Bourne's femme fatale here is Nicky from the previous 2 films (Julia Stiles in a terrific performance). There is a real unspoken attraction between Jason and Nicky that is very stimulating! Some of the exciting set pieces in this one include the aforementioned labyrithine London chase scene, a fantastic mano-y-mano fight between Bourne and Desh (a CIA strongman tasked to finish off Bourne and Nicky, who is supporting Jason's quest for the truth) in Tangier, and a fast-paced car chase in the streets of NY. In addition, Scott Glenn has a small, yet effectively commanding role as CIA director Ezra Kramer. The film moves at a breakneck pace, but never gets stale or tiring to watch. You stay entertained throughout. There is a nifty surprise rather late in the film that will shock the first-time viewer! ULTIMATUM is a fine 3rd act to the Bourne series and definitely leaves you wanting more. Seems like where they missed with SUPREMACY, they more than made up for with ULTIMATUM!",9,1,3,9 September 2008
Fargo," Quirkiness for quirkiness' sake
","I used to have a high opinion of critically acclaimed Oscar- nominated movies...key words USED TO!...A long time ago in a movie-watching galaxy far, far away. Of course this back when I was too young to know any better. Much as I despise most acclaimed films that come out now and think that better ones came out when I was growing up, I can still pick out overrated tripe from the 'good old days' and FARGO (1996) is definitely overrated tripe! FARGO is actually a film that I like to reference when a movie like THE DARK KNIGHT (another overrated piece of trash) comes out because FARGO is one of the first examples of a film where I realized that EVERYONE that praised it so highly back in the day could NOT for the life of them truly justify WHY it was so great! With THE DARK KNIGHT, at the very least fans of that flick can point to the one good thing about it and that is Heath Ledger's performance (but nothing else).Pretty much every review I recall hearing about FARGO used sweeping generalizations to describe it and simply seem to use the excuse that just because of the fact that it was novel for the lead character in a big (directed by Coen Bros.) crime drama film was (A) female and (B) pregnant, and (C) a cop, that automatically makes it groundbreaking and a modern masterpiece.But the simple fact is...there is nothing to Frances McDormand's character, nor William H. Macy's, for that matter. How in the heck McDormand won the Oscar for making barf jokes, sounding stupid, and literally doing nothing for her short screen time (Macy had more than her, seemed like the real central character, and somehow he got tagged for a SUPPORTING nom to her LEADING nom and win) is beyond me. Macy is a tad better, but in the end came across just as emotionless and empty. And the Midwestern accents? EVERY character sounded the same! Every character is treated and acted like a caricature of real people (based on a true story), but none of them (well, save perhaps one in the end) left any kind of impression with me. The Coen's 3 previous big films BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA, and MILLER'S CROSSING (their true best film) all had their character quirks and strangeness, but the characters in those films all had real personality, depth, and at the end of all 3 of those films, I actually drew something important from them.The ONE authentic scene in FARGO is actually the opening one when Macy meets with prospective kidnappers Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to map out the plan to kidnap his wife so he could use the ransom money to solve his financial problems, but from there on, it's all downhill! Then after that, it's just a bunch of quirky, go-nowhere, slow- moving vignettes, some of which have nothing to do with the story, and even the ones that supposedly do are dominated by the annoyances of the characters (overdone) Midwestern accents and just making boring idle conversation, with the actual plot points coming across as distractions...Yeah, we get it, Coens...solving crimes in real life is boring...you proved it!",2,3,9,5 March 2011
Predator," Highly suspenseful, unique sci-fi/action mix!
","1987 contains 3 of the best sci-fi/action/horror films of the entire 1980s: The Hidden, Robocop, and this film I'm reviewing PREDATOR. Just further proof that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a film legend. Again, not a great thespian, but definitely a movie star. The man knew how to carry an action film (literally!) on his back. And PREDATOR is so much more than that! In 1987, PREDATOR was just another Arnie action flick. In retrospect, it is a highly involving, ominous, twisting mystery. It's about a band of Army mercenaries on a CIA-initiated rescue mission in South America. In actuality, the men were lied to by their CIA contact/companion in order to get to top secret information and that there was a previous team that was sent, and due to unknown circumstances, never made it back.Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the team leader and Carl Weathers is the shady CIA contact Dillon and a 'friend' of Dutch's, or so he thought. The rest of Dutch's team includes veteran actors Bill Duke (Mac) and Sonny Landham (Billy), as well as former wrestler-turned actor-turned Governor Jesse Ventura (Blain). This early scene of the commandos attacking the foreign camp is among the best action sequences ever! The editing, cinematography, and sound is top notch in this scene as well as throughout the movie. When watching this film, one can really feel the tension and ever-present danger that constantly engulfs this band of soldiers.The team picks up a female hostage Anna (Elpidio Carillo) who may be more than meets the eye and definitely serves a greater purpose. Upon retrieving the information and succeeding in the mission, the team heads back through the jungle to their helicopter transport. Along the way, they find the mutilated remnants of the previous team, the likes of which none of these veteran commandos has never see. This is when PREDATOR switches gears and goes from action to sci-fi/horror! An alien creature has caused all this. The team must now evade and elude this being just to survive. Once PREDATOR changes direction, it turns from just another standard one-note 80s action flick into a provocative and original horror movie. The up-to-this-point macho tough guys are now WAY out of their league! THEY are the prey! The way the team deals with this new development is excellently scripted, acted, and directed and never devolves into parody or silliness. It actually seems like it could happen, making this film an all-time action classic.Also amazingly for an 80s film, PREDATOR does not have a dated look, which adds to it's universal appeal. It doesn't look '80s' at all, mainly due to the jungle setting, classy camera-work, cinematography, costume design, and the brilliant look of the Predator. Effectively combining action, sci-fi, mysticism, and horror, PREDATOR is an enduring 80s standout!",10,3,4,27 July 2009
The Bourne Identity," A refreshingly exciting and vivid action film
","I didn't really know anything about the character Jason Bourne other than in general he was some type of modern day James Bond type of hero from the novel THE BOURNE IDENTITY. I knew that they did a TV movie back in the late 80s of the same name and that Richard Chamberlain played the hero. But based on what I did know, in no way did I think that Matt Damon was right for the part of an international super-spy. I thought he was too young, too short, too nonathletic looking, etc. Let me just say that I was 100% dead solid wrong! Damon is exceptional as Jason Bourne in THE BOURNE IDENTITY and it is one of my pleasant surprises in film so far the decade of the 2000s. While it is not currently in my very top films of the decade, the way the decade is going, it could very easily end up in the top 10. because there are about only 2 or 3 other big Hollywood films this decade that I think are true modern classics (COLLATERAL and KILL BILL VOL.1 among them).THE BOURNE IDENTITY is actually a surprisingly simple tale of CIA agent Jason Bourne, who loses his memory during a mission gone wrong. Bourne works for a secret sub-section of the CIA only known as the 'Treadstone' operation. This group is led by Conklin (played by the fine actor Chris Cooper in a confident performance). Treadstone seems to specialize in the assassination game, doing the CIA's dirty work by snuffing out potential threats to the US. Bourne goes missing after the failed mission and Conklin at first thinks he may be dead, but just to be safe, he orders CIA moles around the world to be on the lookout for Mr. Bourne in case he pops up.Bourne does pop up at a bank in Zurich where he apparently has a safety deposit box full of fake passports, a lot of cash, and an automatic weapon. This is where he realizes his name is 'Jason Bourne' and that his 'home' is in Paris, which is really just a temporary place that Bourne was staying while on the assignment that went wrong leading him to lose his memory in the first place. While in Zurich, the mole contacts Conklin that Bourne showed up and this is when the fun begins. He goes to the American embassy in Zurich to escape capture, but Conklin has a mole in there, too, and the soldiers there try to take him into custody. During the confrontation, Bourne learns that he has all these amazing physical and mental skills as he methodically takes out his victims one by one (sometimes in bunches) and thinks his way out of danger as much as he brutes himself out.Bourne hitches ride with Marie (well played by the alluring Franka Potente), who is in a bind herself because of inability to get a student visa to get into the US. Initially, she helps Bourne for money, but eventually (you guessed it), she falls for Bourne and vice versa; she also seems to be thrilled by the excitement of it all. So she tries to help him figure out who he is. Meanwhile, Conklin puts out contracts all around the world to 'hit' Bourne, as he can't very well have a secret CIA operative running around with all of Treadstone's dirty secrets. The most memorable assassin out to get Bourne is played by Clive Owen and he and Bourne have an exchange that is one of the best scenes in the film. The irony is that Conklin doesn't know Bourne is an amnesiac, so he is really out to get a man with no memory of Treadstone or it's operations! Bourne just wants to start fresh and be free.THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a very fast-paced, exciting film. I find it much better than any James Bond film. It is a surprisingly simple story told with great flair, imagination, and humanity. As stated before, Damon is excellent in the role and does brilliant job carrying this film. The supporting cast is very good as well and the action is crisp, lean, and mean. It's really a good old-fashioned action movie that everyone can appreciate (modern and old-school audiences alike) because today's advanced technology factors into the film (internet, surveillance, weaponry), yet it is infused with a real humanity that makes you care about the central character and his predicament and wonder how he's going to get himself out of it. Great film.",10,5,8,1 June 2008
Man of Steel," Ambitious, but lacking
","MAN OF STEEL (2013) was perhaps the most highly anticipated superhero film of this century, even more so than Christopher Nolan's highly praised re-booted Batman trilogy (Batman Begins, TDK, TDKR). Nolan had a huge hand in the making of this new Superman re-boot MOS (writing the story), most obviously due to the insane success of his Batman films. And that helps explain why I, overall, did not like MOS! I find Nolan's Batman films to be heavily overrated. They are not really 'superhero' films, so much as melodramatic talkfests that just HAPPEN to have a superhero in them! Nolan's first Batman film 'Begins' was closest to getting it right, with the latter sequels TDK and TDKR getting it wrong! Directed by Zack Snyder, in terms of structure and storytelling, MOS went the way of 'Begins' in relaying the backstory of Young Clark Kent/Kal-El non-linearly with flashbacks. The ambitious epic starts on the planet Krypton with esteemed scientist Jor-El (well-played by the great Russell Crowe) warning the Kryptonian elder council members of impending planetary destruction. In bursts General Zod (played with monotonous rage by Michael Shannon), who overthrows the council and warns Jor-El to join him or suffer the consequences. Refusing, Jor-El escapes with just enough time for he and his wife Lara (played by the enchanting Ayelet Zurer) to place their natural-birthed newborn Kal-El into a spaceship to send him away. After killing Jor-El, Zod is captured by the planetary forces, who send Zod and his cohorts to the Phantom Zone. But soon after Krypton is destroyed, as per Jor-El's warning.Once the baby Kal-El arrives on Earth, the nonlinear storytelling begins! The Earth scenes start in present-day, with an early-30-something Clark Kent (played by promising newcomer Henry Cavill) drifting the planet working odd jobs to hide his abilities and try to escape his destiny. Recurring flashback sequences show several stages of the Young Clark's life in Smallville, Kansas, with his adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (superbly played by the legendary Kevin Costner and the great Diane Lane). These intimate family scenes were actually the best of the film. These sparse family moments revealed the patience, fortitude, and love that the Kents showed in raising Clark to become who he was destined to be.In a parallel story, world-renowned reporter Lois Lane (played solidly by Amy Adams) investigates a military discovery of a Kryptonian spaceship in a remote location below the Earth's surface. This spaceship is also found by Clark, who working as a bartender at one of his odd jobs, inadvertently heard a couple of soldiers discussing the discovery. Clark activates the ship and learns the details of his identity through a sentient CG image of Jor-El, and after an untimely first meeting with Lois on the ship and guiding her to safety, begins to embrace his destiny as Earth's savior. The conclusion of this scene has Clark wearing the famous suit and flying for the first time. This is a very COOL sequence, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's all-too-underused inspiring and original score! Months later, Zod and his small army, including his right-hand lieutenant Faora (played with gusto by seductive Antje Traue) arrive on Earth, having been inadvertently freed from the Phantom Zone by Krypton's destruction. Zod demands that Earth turn over Clark to him. Clark learns of Zod's real plan to destroy Earth and re-populate it with genetically-engineered Kryptonians, then the battle begins! Herein lies my FIRST major problem with MOS. The action sequences were overlong, boring, monotonous, and random! Virtually every action scene was Clark and 'Insert-Random-Kryptonian-Soldier-Here' running/flying into each other and laying waste to anything in sight (buildings, cars, trains, etc.). In particular, I found the final fight scene between Clark and Zod to be painfully boring. The film copped out on showing deaths, even though there obviously had to be MANY in the wake of all the damage that the Kryptonians caused. The lack of gravitas in these 'death'-destruction scenes made them border on the cartoonish and irrelevant.My SECOND major problem with MOS is in the tone of the film. It was much too melodramatic, ominous, and uninspiring, the exact OPPOSITE of what it should be in a SUPERMAN film! While I thought Cavill had his moments as 'Superman' (the scene in the interrogation room with Lois being his best written and acted one), the underlying tone of the film betrayed his character, who was very indecisive. I couldn't empathize with Clark very much as there wasn't enough detail or character depth. So Cavill definitely 'looks' the part (he reminds me of the TV series 'Smallville' version of Superman), his character was a bit too angsty (much like 'Smallville's' version, ironically!). I also felt that Adams as Lois was a bit too underwritten, but at the same time, I kind of liked the simmering chemistry that she built with Cavill throughout the film. I also didn't care much for Shannon's portrayal of Zod. In MOS, Zod came across as much TOO angry and vengeful without much complexity, which is ironic as he had in reality the second major role in the film behind Clark/Superman. Zod always seemed to be in overdrive, even at times when a scene/moment called for subtlety. The best performances in the film to me were that of the veterans Crowe, Costner, and Lane. Costner and Lane, in particular, made the most of their limited screen time. While there were definitely moments of inspiration and greatness in this new superhero epic, in particular Zimmer's inspiring score, the family scenes, and the more intimate moments between Clark and Lois (I really liked the ending!), 'Man of Steel' is an ambitious, yet lacking new entry into the superhero genre.",6,1,2,7 December 2013
Cast Away," Perhaps Tom Hanks' greatest film performance
","Interesting that it was the early 90s where the critics and Academy started recognizing Tom Hanks as an actor of considerable depth and universality. I really think it's A League of Their Own in '92 that got the ball rolling; Hanks totally stole and dominated an ironically female-laden film; Hanks SHOULD have been nominated Best Supporting Actor in a now iconic comic role as Jimmy Dugan. Then in '93 and '94, there were back-to-back Best Actor Oscar wins for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, respectively. Hanks was undeniably great in those films, but I still felt like the praise came a tad too early. I actually wasn't too keen on some of the nominees that Hanks was up against in those two years, so while I felt like he deserved his wins based on his competition, there were some actors who were overlooked in those two years that I felt gave career performances (Kevin Costner in '93 for A Perfect World and Johnny Depp in '94 for Ed Wood) that would have been my personal picks for those awards in those respective years. I guess the question at that point for me was, 'Did Tom Hanks just fluke his way to TWO Best Actor wins?!'Then Hanks put my fears to rest! He continued his roll with Apollo 13 in '95 and it was evident that he wasn't going anywhere! The man proved he was great actor. Heck, he even was a success in his first directorial effort in '96 with That Thing You do! Then, of course he stars in Spielberg's powerful Saving Private Ryan in '98 (another Best Actor nom, for which I think he should have won), then the beautiful The Green Mile in '99 (in retrospect, I think that should have been another Best Actor nom) And it all culminates in this film Cast Away (2000). Hanks would receive his, to date, last Best Actor nomination. Right now, I'll say it, this should have been another Oscar for Mr. Hanks!Hanks plays Fed Ex executive Chuck Noland, whose plane goes down somewhere in the South Pacific. Noland is washed away on a desert island for 4 years and must learn how to survive off of instinct, guts, savvy, and determination. After learning how to make fire (a great scene!), Noland copes day to day by making friends with one of the packages he was delivering, a 'Wilson' volleyball which he attaches the same moniker to. I'm still astounded as to how Hanks pulled this off! Tom Hanks and a volleyball is one of the best pairings in Hollywood history! Of course Hanks went full method with this performance, literally losing a large amount of weight since his character had to live off of sparse island food for 4 years. But, of course, Hanks pulled it off, totally involving the viewer and putting us in his place. The great actors will do that.Many complained about the late scenes of Hanks back in civilization, but I have no problem with them. They're really not that long. I liked the scene with Helen Hunt (Chuck's ex-fiancée who thought he was dead and had married someone else in his absence). It was emotionally involving and I love the music accompanying it with the rain pouring down on them. I also love the real ending, with Noland deciding to go cross country delivering the Fed Ex items recovered on the island, and then meeting angel on earth of a woman that you just KNOW Chuck ended up with! Generally, I think Robert Zemeckis is an overrated director, with Back to the Future being his undisputed masterpiece. But Cast Away 2000 is definitely 2nd on my list of Zemeckis films. It is involving throughout without ever devolving into being boring or unbelievable. Hanks was robbed big time at the Oscars. This is perhaps his greatest role and film performance and should have been his 3rd Oscar!",9,0,0,22 July 2011
The Thing," Meandering, slow, sci-fi tale
","Being a fan of several of John Carpenter's early oeuvre of works (Halloween, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live), I've got to say that I was disappointed in recently getting around to watching his remake of THE THING (1982) and am a tad surprised by how revered this movie is. Having seen the original 1951 Howard Hawks' classic a few times, I was stunned that Carpenter's remake is actually SLOWER than the original film, which moves at a brisker pace, never lets up, and is still fun to watch even over 60s years later! Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a 'slow' film if there's a method to the madness, but there is none here. The Thing just drags and drags and drags and really goes nowhere.Not to mention, I was not much impressed by the casting in this 1982 remake. I thought most of the performances were rather monotonous and lifeless throughout, which a bunch of interchangeable characters. Even the usually reliable Kurt Russell really brought very little to the table in terms of personality. The ONLY character the remotely piqued my interest was the one played by the veteran actor Wilfrid Brimley, and low and behold, Carpenter sidelined him for virtually the entire 2nd and 3rd acts! Other than the talented Brimley, the rest of the cast was literally just there.Getting off to an interesting start, with an alien spaceship hurtling toward Earth, we are immediately introduced to the crew of an Antarctic research and discovery station, who witness the pilot of a helicopter from a nearby station shooting at a seemingly harmless dog. The station captain kills the pilot and they take in the dog, who turns out is an alien beast that kills it's prey, then replicates them in every detail. So that this remake ends up functioning as a mystery-whodunit, as the station crew become paranoid (although it's hard to tell through all the mediocre acting) for the rest of the movie not knowing who is really who.I found this remake to be overly long and very slow. It literally got to a point where I thought the film was over, then it went on for about another 45 minutes! Some of the stuff in the climax was kind of interesting, whittling down the crew to the remaining 'humans', but the getting there was very tedious. I found it strange that as soon as they found out they were dealing with an alien life form, none of them seem flabbergasted or blown away by their discovery. Also, I wondered why they didn't try harder to call for help as the alien threat became increasingly ominous. Plus, the ending left a LOT to be desired. A bit too ambiguous even for my taste. Also, the initially shocking, gory effects wore off quickly as the film progressed and became redundant.Carpenter's film usually have a penchant for thrills and suspense (see aforementioned movies of his that I actually LIKE in my first paragraph), but this one strangely left me cold (pardon the pun!). However, I do give it points (thus, the 5 out of 10 rating), for having some obviously unique (if a bit too gory) effects and piquing my interest early on, just not being able to maintain my attention.",5,9,15,18 August 2013
Split," Shyamalan's best film
","After having seen SPLIT (2017) when it first premiered and Glass last year, I started to think about what M. Night Shyamalan's best film really was. I've always believed The Sixth Sense to be overrated. Awards aren't everything. Then there's Unbreakable, which I actually hadn't got around to seeing until after I watched Split (and anyone who's seen the ending knows why) and ignoring the fact that I saw Split first, I would definitely say that Unbreakable is Shyamalan's best film UNTIL Split. Everything in between is a mixed bag from the super slow Signs to the mildly entertaining The Visit. Then Glass comes out and while I really liked it and thought it had some great moments and a well-written story, it didn't quite hit the spot for me. So I re-watched and analyzed Split and concluded that this film is indeed the BEST of the famous director's works.Set in Philly (where else?), Split tells the story of the disturbed Dennis, a man afflicted multiple personalities, 23 in fact, only some of which are essayed in this film. James McAvoy is utterly brilliant as the man of many layers. The way that he shuffles in and out of the various personas is jaw-dropping. When the movie came out, there was no doubt in my mind that McAvoy deserved Oscar consideration, which sadly he didn't get I think in large part of when the film premiered, too early in the year and the Academy had memory loss come voting time.In the opening scene, Dennis kidnaps 3 teenage girls in a mall parking lot where they had just celebrated one of the girl's birthday party. The 3 girls are birthday girl Claire and her best friend Marcia (excellently played by Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) and loner girl Casey (superbly performed by Anya Taylor-Joy, more on her later), who Claire only invited to her party out of pity as Casey is extremely introverted and rebellious with no friends. But it's Casey's very street smarts and personal experiences that helps the trio navigate through their predicament as the other 2 girls are more sheltered and clueless as to what to do.During their capture, they begin to learn of Dennis' various personalities, which include a crafty British woman named Patricia as well as a 9-year old boy named Hedwig. While Dennis has OCD and needs everything neat and clean, Patricia is the mastermind of the personalities and acts as a kind of gatekeeper, and Hedwig is the unfiltered observer who gleefully tells the girls what Dennis is capable of.Again, McAvoy manages to shift back and forth among these fascinating characters without ever devolving into silliness. While there are moments of levity and humor, of course it's all rather sad and shocking.Along the way, we find out that Dennis is actually being treated by a psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (wonderfully played by screen veteran Betty Buckley). Dr. Fletcher specializes in patients with DID and as the film progresses, tries to break through Dennis' walls and unwittingly begins to unravel his machinations. Meanwhile the female trio bang their heads together to escape Dennis' lair. Split is virtually all psychological drama as it is dialogue-heavy and is as much about tapping into what makes these characters tick as it about moving the plot forward to see if the girls can escape and Dennis will be apprehended.In addition to McAvoy, I honestly believe that both Buckley and especially Taylor-Joy deserved Oscar love. As blown away as I was by McAvoy's work, I was equally enamored by Taylor-Joy's contribution to this piece. As iconic as McAvoy's characters are, I think Casey is just as memorable and the damaged, internal, survivor Casey is the true protagonist of this masterwork, while McAvoy's characters all function as pretty much villains that need to be defeated.Despite the film's 2-hour length, Shyamalan fashions a very tight film with no wasted moments or unnecessary scenes. I've even seen some of the deleted scenes and think they would have fit well into the film. Some times, you can never have too much of a good thing and Split is more than good. Now that the decade has come to a close, I can honestly say it's in my Top 5 films of the 2010s. Shyamalan is officially back!",10,1,5,24 February 2020
North by Northwest," A deliriously entertaining masterwork
","Alfred Hitchcock was a certified genius of a filmmaker. He could scare you, shock you, surprise you, enthrall you, make you think, make you smile, make you laugh, and all the while making you a part and parcel of the storytelling and action in his film. His goal was always to make the audience a part of the action and take them along for the ride. He may do this to absolute perfection in this film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, my absolute favorite film of his. It's debatable whether or not this is his greatest film. A lot of so-called film 'critics' will swear by VERTIGO(although I'm not crazy about it), some say PSYCHO, others say NOTORIOUS, some prefer SHADOW OF A DOUBT, others REBECCA. Who knows? I just know that NORTHW BY NORTHWEST, without a doubt, is the most thoroughly enjoyable, fun, fascinating, entertaining, and eye-popping film that Hitchcock ever did. I love every frame of it. The first 30 minutes alone is more captivating, exciting and entertaining than 99.9% of the crap they throw at us nowadays in the movies.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a normal, run-of-the-mill advertising agency executive. Grant deserves all praise of being the legend that he truly was for what he does in this film. Grant's Roger Thornhill is one of 'us', a fairly regular everyday Joe who gets thrust in the most convoluted of situations: mistaken for a government agent named 'Kaplan' by treacherous U.S. enemies (led by the classy James Mason), Thornhill is whisked off captive one evening and his life is threatened and he is almost killed, but he thankfully escapes his captors and so the fun begins in finding out who these bad guys are and why they think he is Kaplan.The film has a kind of snowball effect. Each situation that Thornhill is thrown into or gets himself into is more dangerous than the previous one and he has to find some way to get himself out of it. Hitchcock almost seems to relish scaring the Bejesus out of this guy just to see how he will slick or cajole his way out of it. Thornhill is really an unwitting and unexpected pawn in the battle between U.S. agents and the enemy traitors. All the qualities that made Cary Grant a star shine through in this film: he is handsome, classy, witty, funny, sarcastic, and surprisingly agile. Whoever thought he could pull off being an action hero after all those years of playing primarily romantic comedies? But he totally gives a convincing performance in this film.Of course at some point we are introduced to the femme fatale, in this case Eva Marie Saint, who is super-sexy and mysterious in this role. Saint's character makes you realize why so many women found Cary Grant so charming and irresistible.The film has some of the most memorable sequences and set pieces ever in history: the United Nations murder, the Mount Rushmore finale, and most of all, that magnificent crop-dusting sequence smack dab in the middle of the film that forever captured the hearts, minds, and imaginations of moviegoers everywhere. The scene is all at once action-packed, scary, dangerous, exciting, and funny.For me, this Hitchcock film (first shown in 1959) can be seen as a very early example of a blockbuster summer action movie. It has all the elements: a colorful look and feel, lots of outdoor scenery, nonstop action, a breathtaking pace, and a central character through which the story is told and that we could all identify with and root for.Truly a great achievement by both Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant, with big-time assists from a great cast of supporting actors and actresses, a witty script, and the beautiful scenery of various U.S. locations.",10,3,5,15 March 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I enjoyed the highly underrated T3 more than T2!
","I know hardcore T2 fans will call it blasphemy...but IMHO, 2003's TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (T3) is a more ENJOYABLE movie AND a BETTER film than T2! I re-watched T2 to get a handle on it's praise and conclude that it can ONLY be for the incredible special effects. T2 literally comes to a screeching halt for a good hour and that is one tedious hour filled with cheesy dialog, rambling, and pontification. And the plot of T2 is paper thin! Everything that happens feels staged. It is probably the least necessary film of the 'trilogy'.T3 follows a similar formula to T1 and T2 and again has the 'good' Terminator, the T800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last big film role before retiring from acting and going into politics) arrives in early 21st century LA. I'm glad to report that Arnie is SPOT ON in T3! Arnie is as iconic to the 80s and 90s as an action star as Clint Eastwood was to the 60s and 70s. Great to see the legend go out on a high note! Amazing that the past middle-aged man could light up the screen in a great action movie as well as he could 20 years earlier.Ironically, the T800's task this time is not to save John Connor, but to save Katherine 'Kate' Brewster (played by Clare Danes in an underrated performance). Kate is John's future wife and a key member of the future rebellion against the machines. Danes in T3 reminds me a lot of Linda Hamilton from T1, a sweet, vulnerable character with an unexplored inner toughness.The evil Terminator this time is the highly advanced TX (played excellently by the incredible-looking Kristanna Loken; that's right, a Terminatrix!). The TX can not only take the form of people she comes in contact with (like T1000 in T2), but also she is equipped with a weapons arsenal that is able to do damage to Arnie's more obsolete T800. I don't know what movie the naysayers of this film were watching, but Loken is out and out terrific in this role and not once did I think she was anything but a machine (albeit a sexy looking one!). And I think that her performance is lot more attributable to Loken over the CGI, whereas a great amount of Robert Patrick's role in T2 was DUE to CGI.Never fear, because John Connor is in this, too! John is roaming LA as a vagrant (taking odd jobs to survive) to conceal his identity from any more Terminators that may come to find him. John's introduction in T3 is rather unsettling as it appears he has lost all hope and may be ready to end it all. John is played superbly by Nick Stahl, in a truly under-appreciated performance. Stahl delivers a very subtle, nuanced performance. I found his actions and reactions to be authentic. Also, Stahl ACTUALLY looks like he could be the product of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton from T1, resembling both actors, which adds to the authenticity of his character; you can actually see parts of both Reese and Sarah from T1 in Stahl's John! Stahl is the glue that holds T3 together for me.The Terminators arrive at the same time as John at Kate's vet clinic and the T800 saves John and Kate from the TX, then a chase ensues. T3 is very similar to T1 in that it's tone is fast-paced and bleak. I'm not putting T3 on the same level as T1! T3 is a bit closer to the modern action movie than the sleeper low budget art film that T1 turned out to be, but it has a lot of heart, just like T1 had.Being a sequel, it borrows situations from T1 and T2, like the obligatory opening scene of Arnie confronting yet another 'lowlife' to acquire clothing. But I was amazed at how deftly this, and many other, scenes were handled. The director Jonathan Mostow did a great job of generating wit and humor from cliché situations, mostly due to the efforts of the deadpan Schwarzenegger.T3 seems like less of an 'epic' film than T2, which I don't think a bad thing, and is amazingly short for a modern day Hollywood summer movie. The way that Doomsday approaches and the machines take over is a tad spotty for me, but the ending of T3 is one of the better, most provocative ones I've seen in a movie in YEARS and actually serves as a fitting end to the franchise (of course there are more sequels out there!).Last but not least, T3 has some GREAT action scenes! The early big chase scene where the advanced TX operates all those vehicles in unison is a contender for BEST action sequence of the decade! The climactic scenes, including the big showdown between the T800 and the TX, are pulse-poundingly good! The feasibility of T3's action scenes stem from real stunts/effects and limited, spare use of CGI.Again, I think the characters are easy to root for in this. Stahl and Danes give John and Kate a pleasant innocence yet underlying toughness and evolve convincingly during the film and prove to be worthy to hold the mantle of saviors of the human race. And Loken, if a bit sexed up in this film, is quite convincing as a robot. Believe me, this could have EASILY been a laughable performance and she is surprisingly MORE THAN GOOD. Finally, the legendary Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that he could still handle an action film in his final acting days!The fact that James Cameron didn't direct this is a plus as far as I'm concerned. I think most of his movies after T1 are immensely overrated. He's not the best storyteller and T2 was proof of that. In the end, T3 is an excellent action movie worthy of being part of the Terminator franchise...My two cents!",9,2,4,2 May 2010
Wanted," One fun ass movie!
","WANTED (2008) is one of those flicks that knows what it's about...unabashed, unadulterated, unapologetic, fun! The plot and story are thin, thin, thin, but so what? The movie is told with confidence, flair, and style and never lets up. Infusing elements of The Matrix as well as action sequences reminiscent of scenes from Mission Impossible (the train scene), The Karate Kid (training scenes), and Commando (the kick ass finale), WANTED stars up-and-coming superstar James McAvoy (from Atonement and The Last King of Scotland), a young Brit with loads of talent and ability. And he gets to get the action genre out of the way early in his career! McAvoy supplies the flick with much-needed humor. He is self-deprecating as he is a rather slight man, but at the same time, convinces when he becomes a true badass.McAvoy is supported by none other than megastars Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, who act as McAvoy's mentors. Freeman, while adding dignity and weight to the proceedings, manages never to come across as pretentious (as he sometimes does in films) and plays his role just with tongue-in-cheek appeal reminiscent of the mentors in the KILL BILL movies. Actually, I'm not a huge fan of Jolie at all, but her over-the-top sex appeal is toned down just enough in this to make her sensual, but convincing as a deadly assassin. And her odd chemistry with McAvoy is fun to watch. But McAvoy is the main draw in this flick, a refreshing newcomer that keeps you rooting for his character to the very end.WANTED starts off with a literal Matrix-like bang as a mysterious assassin (nailed by David O'Hara) performs his latest hit, then after a series of thrilling sequences, is killed. Then we are introduced to Wesley (McAvoy), a nebbishy office cog. Wesley has a verbally abusive boss, the bombastic Janice (scene-stealing Lorna Scott), a brainless, bimbo-ish, self-involved girlfriend (hilarious Kristin Hager), and a jerkish best friend (funny Chris Pratt), and he has constant anxiety attacks (of course!).An attempt is made on his life at the drug store buying his supply of anxiety medication, then hot female assassin Fox (Jolie) intervenes to save him. Wesley is destined to follow in his footsteps and become a world class assassin, so says Fox's employer Sloan (Freeman). After a lot of pleading and plodding, Sloan convinces Wesley to face his destiny head on and Fox and Sloan's other assassins (including rapper Common, who is quite convincing in a small role) train him.The scenes of Wesley's training are slick and stylish with great special effects and stuntwork. Freeman and Jolie's cold, professional seriousness is a great counterpoint to McAvoy's comical, light take on everything. The 2 opposing styles clash to make a totally enjoyable movie-going experience. It's almost like they WILL him to become a bad-ass, which is kind of what happens! The action scenes are over-the-top, but entertaining as all get out and done in a fun, fast-paced way where I couldn't help but be drawn in. The ending scene is as exciting as the come, with a perfect musical accompaniment that makes it worth it. WANTED!",9,1,2,2 August 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Solid action movie with impressive effects, but not a standout where it counts
","The opening scenes of James Cameron's acclaimed, overrated 1991 sequel TERMINATOR 2:JUDGMENT DAY (T2) are all one needs to see to know why this movie is not nearly the equal or superior to it's classic predecessor THE TERMINATOR (T1)!In the first 30 minutes of T2, we get THREE cliché 'Hollywood' scenes: (1) Arnold Schwarzenegger's naked 'good guy' T800 (polarizing the bad guy in T1) in a ho-hum bar brawl with a group of mocking bikers (the SAME scene occurred in T1 and grittier, esp. the reaction of the last punk, whose muted, jittery fear spoke volumes!), the last of which pulls a gun (typical sequelitis up-the-ante trick), then unconvincingly utters TAKE IT! His 'fear' was the typical 'Hollywood reactionary type' that I've seen in a bunch of movies.(2) A scene with a now loony, buffed-up Sarah Connor (reprised by Linda Hamilton) in an insane asylum where the police psychiatrist from T1 now works (convenient) as he briefs a group of interns on her and then an utterly predictable and tepid exchange ONLY for explanation and exposition...BORING!(3) ANOTHER expository scene introducing 10-year old John Connor (a fetus at the end of T1), establishing him as a juvenile delinquent and showing how his foster folks are jerks We also get introduced to a new, improved evil Terminator, the liquid-metal T1000, played by Robert Patrick whose job it is to terminate John Connor; he can assume any human form and kills and takes the place of a cop (convenient plot device for the rest of the movie)I don't see how a movie with such a tedious introductory 30 minutes can be proclaimed the 'greatest' ANYTHING of all time! And the rest of the film is filled with nothing but cliché dialog that is still sadly heard today in many action films (I guess T2 is influential in that sense).Schwarzenegger and Hamilton in T2 aren't given near as much to work with and not allowed to display the depth and range of emotions that permeated throughout T1, making it a provocative film and not JUST an action movie. The dialog in T1 had a realistic edge to it, ranging from Reese's hypnotic rants about the apocalypse and the T800's determination to kill Sarah to the gritty, wry (and convincing!) banter at the police station. Arnie in particular is stuck actually in a very thankless role, playing lapdog to John Connor (played by Edward Furlong, who gets to deliver an amazing amount of forgettable dialog). I saw nothing that would make me think this kid would be the future resistance leader and no mother-son chemistry between Furlong and Hamilton.For me, the biggest reason why T2 is not in the league of T1 is the 'evil' Terminator himself. In no way, shape, or form, does Robert Patrick's T1000 match or come close to Arnie's no-nonsense, unflappable T800! I've seen some people complain that Patrick is not on screen enough. But guess what? Arnie probably had about the same (maybe even less) screen time in T1 than Patrick did in this movie and Schwarzenegger managed to be 100% convincing and frightening every second he was on screen in T1. To be fair, Patrick was confined by the conventions of what is really a generic action movie.Another big reason T2 is a fail for me is that (contrary to popular opinion!) it violates all that was built up in T1. Now, all of a sudden TWO (one in 84 and one in 94) evil Terminators were sent back. So there was a backup plan all along! Kind of takes the sting out of what Reese went through to save Sarah and ensure the future in T1, doesn't it?! T2 is rather long, also, with quite a few, expository, unnecessary scenes that seem to be designed to give it depth and to stretch the film out to the appropriate length of a big, summer blockbuster movie. Example would be a scene past the midway point where Sarah narrates (while she looks at them) how the good T800 is like perfect father to John of all the fathers he's had; the narration doesn't work and the whole scene doesn't work. What's ironic is that in T1, the human Reese was just as willing to sacrifice others to save Sarah as the T800 was in order to kill her, while in T2, Reese's 'replacement', who is not human, is sanitized to the point of not even seeming like a machine most of the time b/c young John won't allow him to kill; I guess it's a message about morality even in war, but not delivered as effectively (due to stilted dialog and unbelievable scenes) as the 'win at all costs' attitude of T1.In fairness, even though dated in terms of 80s, even people that love T1 (I do!) don't hold that against it and defend it for it's deep story, strong characterizations, brisk pace, nightmarish-noir look, and influence on the sci-fi genre. Even people that like T2 more than T1 (I do not!) compliment the original on these same things, so that's something.I understand why T2 is held in regard in terms of special effects. For a near 20-year old movie, the effects are still impressive, especially the smooth transitions in Patrick's T1000 going from metal to human form and back. CGI movies today could learn a thing or two from this film. Also, all the action scenes in this movie are 'necessary', if a bit showy. The action in T2 is well executed, if a bit too clean (minimal blood, no guts). But in between the few big, well done action scenes, there's standard dialog, boring character interactions, and predictable outcomes. None of this was true of T1!",7,7,10,30 April 2010
Disturbia," Suspenseful, entertaining modern take on 'Rear Window'!
","I must be one of the few people on the planet that thinks of Shia LaBeouf as a fine actor! There's something unique, different, and engaging about the way he plays his roles. On the surface, he seems like he's always playing the manic, fast-talking rebellious youth who loves for trouble and danger, but in each of his key roles in the late 00s, I find something different in each characterization he played. The first thing I saw LaBeouf in was the entertaining golf flick 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' in 2005 and he was wonderful in that. And his manic energy was the one of the actual plusses for Michael Bay's otherwise empty-headed 'Transformers' flicks in '07 and '09! He was also persuasive in 'Eagle Eye' in '08. Right in the middle of all of this might be my actual to-date favorite role- performance that LaBeouf has given in this film I'm reviewing DISTURBIA (2007).'Disturbia' is an interesting, suspenseful, well-done modern take on Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic 'Rear Window'. The protagonist is Kale (superbly played by LaBeouf), a high-schooler who we meet in an endearing opening scene of him fishing with his Dad (played by the always reliable Matt Craven). On their way back home, Kale and his father get into a tragic accident where the father dies and then the plot of the film starts 1 year later with Kale a troubled teen having committed petty crimes acting out after losing his Dad. It's almost summer and during the final week of the school year, Kale attacks his Spanish teacher after being provoked and is put under house arrest for 3 months. Soon after, we meet Kale's mother Julie (understatedly played by the reliable Carrie Ann Moss), who tries to instill a sense of discipline in Kale, and Kale's best friend Ronnie (engagingly played by scene-stealer Aaron Yoo), who is Kale's 'partner in crime' throughout the rest of the film. Viola Davis shows up in a nice cameo role as the probation officer assigned to give Kale his ankle bracelet that he must wear all summer, as he's confined to his home. As the days pass, Kale gets bored, but brightens up quickly as one day going through his daily routine of spying on his neighbors through telescope and binoculars, he sees that a couple of new neighbors have come to town. One is the next-door family with a beautiful daughter Ashley (solidly played by the stunning Sarah Roemer, somewhat of a Kate Hudson lookalike if Kate Hudson were actually attractive!). The other is the across-the- street neighbor Mr. Turner (excellently performed by the great veteran David Morse in arguably his creepiest film role). Kale and Ashley develop an attraction/connection as both come from broken homes and bond. Kale through his spying notices that Turner seems to be a shady figure. One night, Kale witnesses Turner has an argument with one of his dates and then later he and Ashley see him carrying a bloody bag from his house. So the trio Kale, Ashley, Ronnie snoop even more into it and things get out of control fast. The homage to Rear Window totally works, but mainly because the film takes only the general elements of the protagonist forced to stay at home, the beautiful girlfriend, the wisecracking sidekick, and the suspicious neighbor, but tweaking and twisting it to be more favorable to the modern viewer. 'Rear Window' is actually not among my favorite Hitchcock movies, so I found this take on it a refreshing alternative. The film gives the hero more depth as we sympathize with Kale's losing his Dad. It also is refreshing to see teenage characters like Kale, Ashley, and Ronnie that have believable personalities and resourcefulness that feels organic and not some writer's daydream of what they THINK teenagers are like.Mainly, though, I loved the performances of LaBeouf, who knows how to carry a film for such a young actor, and Morse, who's got the creepy factor down to perfection. Their protagonist-antagonist dynamic is enjoyable. The film is just about the right length and the plot moves at a brisk pace. An entertaining update of a classic film!",9,0,0,7 June 2015
Face_Off," Best action film of the 1990s
","Maybe the 90s weren't so bad! Seems like the 1980s were packed with great, unique, memorable action flicks (THE TERMINATOR, LETHAL WEAPON, ROBOCOP, DIE HARD, etc.), but what about the 90s? All you really had in the early 90s were sequels/retreads of all those great 80s flicks and none (in my opinion) near as good as the originals. The 90s got all 'serious' on us moviegoers. Action movies seemed to be fading away. Then, all of a sudden, in 1997 (really a year of some great films) the action film was taken to an entirely new level with FACE/OFF! Really, I think FACE/OFF is the best action flick of that decade and its not even close! And like all those 80s action flicks I named previously, FACE/OFF has a story and heart. That is why all those films remain great today and why FACE/OFF is great. It's not just action.FACE/OFF stars iconic actors John Travolta (fresh off of a career re-generation with PULP FICTION, BROKEN ARROW, and GET SHORTY) and Nicolas Cage (fresh off a Best Actor win for LEAVING LAS VEGAS). Let me just say this before I finish this review: Travolta and Cage are superb! These 2 actors had the unenviable task of having to essentially become the other and both pulled it off brilliantly. I didn't see a false note in either performance.Travolta plays senior FBI agent Sean Archer, a world-weary man whose son was coldly murdered (he was supposed to die) 8 years earlier by vicious villain Castor Troy (Cage). The exciting opening scene at the airport results in Troy's capture and he is seemingly mortally wounded, but still barely alive. Before his 'death', Troy told Archer that he planted a bomb somewhere in LA and so the CSI scientists at FBI headquarters convince Archer that they can 'remove' Troy's face and put it on Archer so that Archer can infiltrate the maximum security prison where Troy's brother Nestor (played by Alessandro Nivola) is being held and get him to reveal the location of the bomb. The prison scenes are exciting as well as the prisoners wear computer-tracked boots that monitor their every move and location. Now Cage is playing Archer and does get Nestor to reveal the whereabouts, but he is stuck in the prison as his contact has been murdered by Troy, who awoke from his coma to see that he has no face. So he puts on Archer's face, so now Travolta is playing Troy. Got all that? Archer is flabbergasted that Troy has his face and breaks out of prison and must assume Troy's identity until he can figure all this out. The general authorities are unaware of all this as the only person who knew (other than Archer) is dead. It's a convoluted plot, but brilliantly executed due to the gusto performances by the 2 leads, a solid script, and invigorating action scenes. The supporting cast is excellent as well: the aforementioned Nivola, Joan Allen (very sexy as Archer's wife; she has chemistry with both Travolta and Cage), Gina Gershon as Troy's lady, and Dominique Swain as Archer's daughter.The great John Woo directed FACE/OFF and he has crafted an original, thought-provoking thriller that essentially re-generated the action genre after it seemed like it was dying a slow death in the 90s. FACE/OFF is a great addition to the all-time great action films.",10,1,2,1 July 2009
Spider-Man," Raimi's best SPIDERMAN was this one!
","In reality, despite what WAY TOO MANY people say, Sam Raimi's original SPIDERMAN (2002) film is the best that he did. SPIDERMAN 2 just plain sucked! It did...It really did! SPIDERMAN 3 was not as bad as people say and had a much more 'entertainment' factor going for it than 2 ever did. But this first SPIDERMAN, flaws and all, is the best of the lot b/c Raimi kept it, in a word...simple! It flowed much more easily and didn't have stalls in action or plot like both of its sequels did. In SPIDERMAN, the action actually comes from the plot rather than defines it.SPIDERMAN tells the tale of Peter Parker (solid performance by Tobey Maguire), a meek, smart New York City high-schooler who is about to graduate with his best friends Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco); Maguire, Dunst and Franco are fresh young faces and nice choices for these roles. Mary Jane aka MJ is the object of Peter's affection and Harry is Peter's secret ally for MJ's love. Also, Harry is jealous of Peter because his wealthy father Norman (the great Willem Dafoe) respects Peter more than him. Peter has science acumen (physics his major when he graduates) and had to work hard to support himself, whereas Harry had everything handed to him on a silver platter, so there is underlying tension between the two boys. Peter lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (distinguished film veterans Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson).Norman is the head of Oscorp, whose primary division is R&D. He is tasked by the military to build a supersuit for human enhancement, but when better bid comes along a rival corporation to develop the technology, Norman (in disguise wearing the outfit he was developing for the military) attacks their lab and kills the general in charge Slocum (Ron Perlman). Now Oscorp has regained control, but later, the other corporation after recouping its losses is big enough to buy out Oscorp and when Norman's board agrees with it, he goes insane and vows revenge and wreaks havoc on NYC as The Green Goblin.Meanwhile, Peter has been bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip and sees that he has developed amazing abilities (web-shooting, buidling-scaling, super strength). At first, he uses it for silly things like impressing MJ and his fellow high-schoolers and also he goes out one night to an amateur wrestling match to try to win money to buy a car to impress MJ further. Dressed in a spider costume, Peter wins, but when the event organizer won't pay him, Peter rebels by refusing to stop a thief who stole all the money from the office safe. Ironically, Peter finds out later that night that this thief killed his Uncle Ben during the police chase, so Peter goes after him, finds him, and accidentally kills him. In the ensuing months, Peter's guilt and agony turn to productivity as he vows to fight crime under the mantra 'Spiderman'. During this time, the 3 friends have graduated high school and Peter enrolls at NYU majoring in physics, MJ pursues a career on Broadway, and Harry goes to work for his father and is set to become his heir.Suffice to say, Spiderman and the Green Goblin square off and in the end, Spidey prevails, but not before Harry finds out that his dad was the villainous Goblin. Harry vows to avenge his father's death, aka SEQUELS! The biggest issue I have with these SPIDERMAN films is Peter's borderline obsession with MJ, who I find to be a very 'loose woman'. She bounces from boyfriend to boyfriend way to easily! Peter should take that into account in his assessment of whether or not she is the right woman for him to spend the rest of his life with! What makes SPIDERMAN a solid comic book tale is that Raimi does a find job balancing the stories of it's main characters lives and has just enough action at the right moments, but it never quite devolves into the sappiness or stops dead in it's tracks, like both of it's sequels did, esp. SPIDEY 2! The acting is good, especially by Dafoe, and the ending scenes are especially powerful with a really memorable, emotional ending. A solid entry to the comic book movie fold!",8,0,1,11 February 2010
Collateral," An edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride with a soul
","COLLATERAL is the best film of 2004! It includes what very well may be Tom Cruise's greatest film performance, and to me, that's saying a lot. He gets too much flack for his personal life and beliefs, so Hollywood pretty much hates him and is biased against him. The irony is that 20 or so years ago (when he wasn't so strange) and when he was doing critically acclaimed films like COLOR OF MONEY, RAIN MAN, and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, the excuse for not giving him an Oscar was that 'he was too young' or 'he made so much money so he doesn't need an Oscar, too' or 'his time will come'. Well, the time is long past. He should have won for JERRY MAGUIRE, a glaring oversight in 1996. Now EVERYONE in Hollywood makes a ton of money. For some inexplicable reason, Cruise is held up to a higher standard than a lot of stars that I believe are lesser than him talent-wise. So, now they don't have that excuse not to give him the award, so the excuse now is that 'he's a nut-job'. ...Whatever!Cruise's performance in COLLATERAL is truly memorable and ironically underrated as he was not even nominated for Best Actor (as he should have been). It's one of the most fascinating performances of this decade so far. Cruise is totally believable and enthralling as a charming, lethal, detached, world-weary assassin. Cruise is not the only star of this film, though. Jamie Foxx is a revelation himself in COLLATERAL and he and Cruise form one of the best pairings in recent Hollywood history. Foxx gave Cruise a lot of credit for lifting his performance and Cruise immediately called Foxx to congratulate Foxx on his Best Actor nom for RAY (which COLLATERAL kind of set this up for; Foxx also got nominated Best Supporting Actor for COLLATERAL). You see, everyone doesn't hate Tom Cruise and Tom Cruise isn't the worst human being alive, folks! OK, back to the film. Appropriately, it starts out with our introduction to Tom Cruise's character. We don't know his name yet, but he is very unique-looking (grayish hair, sunglasses, bright suit), but doesn't stand out too much. He 'inadvertently' bumps into another guy at LAX, which is an excuse for them to switch bags. Then this unknown cool dude heads for downtown LA. Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cab driver who is a perfectionist at his job (cab stays clean, uses the fastest/safest routes to get fares to their destination) but he has wanderlust and ideas, but fails to follow through. Max 'purposely' picks up a fare Annie (Jada Pinkett-Smith in a sexy and mature performance), who is a prosecutor. Max and Annie have an interesting conversation that really sets the tone for the rest of the convos in the film. Max drops Annie off at her office building, then Cruises character arrives by subway-rail at the same time. They cross paths briefly as she goes up the escalator, him down. He ends up being Max's next fare and we learn his name is 'Vincent'. What do you wanna bet that's not his real name?!Vincent needs Max to drive him around LA at 5 stops, saying that he is a salesman and has dealings with 5 'clients'. He gives him $600 to do this. At the first stop, while Max is waiting, a dead body falls from the apartment complex above on Max's cab and he realizes that Vincent killed him and that he is a contract killer. From here on, Max is Vincent's prisoner and he is compelled to drive him to his destinations. The 2 men establish a kind of uneasy simpatico during the course of the rest of the film. Interestingly, both men are professional when it comes to their jobs, but Vincent has found his calling and Max has not. Vincent is focused, confident and without hesitation, while Max, personality-wise, is rather shy and under-confident. The core difference is that Vincent has a kind of charm and ease with how he deals with people but he is utterly detached from developing any deep connection with anyone, while Max is more shy, but he has the capacity to care.There is a parallel story to Vincent and Max's, with a Latino cop Det. Fanning (excellently played by Mark Ruffalo) working with his police cronies and the FBI trying to figure out what is going on with the killings. Along for the ride are a bunch of supporting characters, some of which are basically cameo or one-scene roles, but you remember them long after you've seen the movie: the aforementioned Pinkett-Smith as Annie, Max's mother (scene-stealer Irma P. Hall), saxophone-player Daniel (exceptional work by veteran actor Barry Shabaka Henley), Vincent's employer Felix (superbly performed by Javier Bardem). Really, this cast is brilliant, all unique, believable characters.Michael Mann directed the film and, in my opinion, this is his GREATEST accomplishment as a director. The film has an uber-cool, leisurely, atmospheric feel and tone which helps drive the story. The eclectic music in the film is perfectly placed and timed and places a unique signature for each scene. There are many great moments that stay with you long after you have seen the film. The true genius of this flick is that while the story idea/plot is 100% convoluted and unbelievable, the way that the situations play out are very realistic. A thrilling joyride of a movie that is contender for best film of the decade...THE END!",10,5,6,9 March 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Now this is more like it!
","Hardcore fans of Sam Raimi's Spiderman can rail all they want to. THIS version of the Marvel Comics superhero, Marc Webb's THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012) is BETTER! While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick, I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully, there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better, because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman, Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty 'amazing' newcomer Andrew Garfield (who was superb in The Social Network) as the well-known iconic character of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and two-time Oscar winner Sally Field) as a child.Peter's father was a brilliant scientist working on cross-genetics technology that allows an organism to cure and re-generate itself by merging with another. Peter, a novice photographer who inherited his father's science acumen, accidentally stumbles upon some of his father's work in his Aunt and Uncle's attic, including a formula that solves the cross-genetic puzzle that his father's former colleague Dr. Curt Connors (sublimely played by Rhys Ifans) has been trying to solve for years. After sneaking into the Oscorp facility and passing himself off as an intern, Peter snoops into a lab full of test subject spiders, one of which latches onto him and bites him, giving him spider-like abilities: strength, speed, elusiveness, scales, web-shooting.Connors works for Oscorp, whose founder and leader Norman Oscorp is dying and in need of a cure, and so Connors is trying to use the cross-geneticism to accomplish this. With Peter's help, the puzzle is 'solved' and Connors ends up using himself as the first human test subject as he has only arm, which becomes regenerated, but it also has enormous side effects, transforming him into The Lizard, Spiderman's first enemy.During this time, Peter, caught up in his work with Oscorp and bemoaning his parents' abandonment, selfishly chooses to ignore a robbery, which inadvertently leads to his Uncle Ben's death, so Peter initially uses his newfound powers to go an a rampage to find his Uncle's killer as he stalks the streets of New York on a nightly basis, bringing lowlife criminals to justice.A romance develops between Peter and his fellow high-schooler, the equally scientifically inclined Gwen Stacy (played with exquisite charm and maturity by the gifted Emma Stone). The Peter-Gwen relationship is really the heart of this film. Very beautiful and engaging. In addition to his Aunt and Uncle, Gwen actually gives Peter a purpose and direction. Even though in virtually every modern superhero film, the girlfriend always seems to find out the secret identity, this is the first film that I think does it in a truly genuine, clever, mature, and natural way, and not just for shock value or cheap effect. I dare say that the romantic aspect is really the MAIN reason why this film works, whereas in Raimi's flicks, I couldn't wait for the 'romantic' parts to come and go to get to the action! Credit really must go to Garfield and Stone for having incredible chemistry and being terrific actors. The Raimi films are really juvenile by comparison when it comes to the realistic love story in TAS. Special mention should also go to legendary comedian Denis Leary, who does an extremely effective and refreshing turn as Gwen's father Police Captain Stacy, injecting the character with his trademark sarcasm, but also coming across as very commanding.Another thing this film does is that it literally builds Peter from the ground up as a hero, making him learn the hard way through attempts, failures, experiences, pain, loss, and gain. Even many times when Peter is wearing the suit, he still acts very human and down-to-earth. He has to LEARN how to be a hero by still using his own instincts and common sense. It's not just about looking cool scaling walls and kicking ass! Spiderman isn't Superman! The film also stages the action as realistic as possible, with a healthy dose of CG effects, of course. But, here, unlike in Raimi's films, every action scene makes sense and we get to see how Spidey must use his webs on ACTUAL surfaces! Not just magically touching the sky, the webs hit just about everything in sight: buildings, cars, windows, and even other people! Garfield is simply superb as the awkward, gifted teen-aged Peter Parker, who has led a tragic existence, but finds a purpose through the memory of his parents, his aunt and uncle, Gwen, and the innocent citizens of New York. I usually think sequels suck, but I patiently await the sequel to his underrated, under-appreciated, extremely compelling and original superhero flick!",10,46,63,1 May 2013
Aliens," Seriously overrated action sci-fi flick
","ALIENS (1986) is another example of Hollywood reeling the audience in making a bigger, splashier, flashier sequel fooling many of them thinking that it beats the original. While the original 'Alien' was a quality, forward-thinking sci-fi film of sustained tension culminating in horror and terror, this sequel 'Aliens' is the standard pump-up-the-volume, loud, proud, and extremely empty sequel. The dated argument is perhaps not the best one since many movies (even good ones) from the 80s appear dated now. But the best sci-fi thrillers from the 80s (Robocop, Terminator, Predator, Hidden) still to this day have something at their core that make them universal and stand the test of time. 'Aliens' does not. It essentially is just a mindless action flick with annoying, one-dimensional characters, including the lead.Sigourney Weaver got an undeserved Best Actress nomination playing Ellen Ripley (the only surviving member from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'). Weaver literally has one facial expression the entire flick...MEAN! I didn't see any semblance of depth or complexity to her character that would warrant an Oscar nom. She just looks like she could bore a hole through everyone she stares at. Her voice inflection is the same throughout the film, whether she's mad, happy, or sad. Basically, she is just given a lot to do to make her seem tough and brave, but most of it is very manipulative. We get the point Cameron...Everyone else is stupid and weak, but Ripley is stroooong!James Cameron directs this sequel and it is nowhere near the class of its predecessor. Frozen in space for many years, Ripley is revived and asked to return to the alien planet LV-426 to act as adviser on what happened to a colony of humans. The company financing the mission uses one its top executives Burke (Paul Reiser in an actual good performance as a shifty corporate shill) to persuade her. Ripley has nightmares from her ALIEN experience. She eventually agrees in part to try to beat her demons.Ripley and Burke are accompanied by an escort of Marines led by the green Lt Gorman (William Hope) and Sgt Apone (Al Matthews). The Marine grunt include Pvts Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein). Actually, Biehn as Hicks is quite good. He brings a solid, unassuming hero quality to his role. But the rest of the Marines are standard, chest-pumping, obscenity-spewing annoyances. Paxton's Hudson is the standard comic relief and Vasquez' macho-tough-girl-acts-like-a-guy character is very contrived. Also on-board is the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen in a slick, convincing performance). Of course this is a problem for Ripley after what happened to the crew in 'Alien'. Biehn, Reiser, and Henriksen are the only actors to really rise above the weak material and formulate convincing characters.On the planet, the group finds that the colony has been eradicated and encounters a horde of alien creatures that they must fight off. The sole survivor is a little girl Newt (Carrie Henn, who is second billed for some odd reason; why isn't Biehn second billed?). Without barely saying a word, Newt is one of the most pretentious kids I've ever seen in a flick and her screaming is maddening...RIIIIIPLEY! As they get whittled down to just a few, in the end Ripley saves the day.'Aliens' suffers from being much ado about nothing. Beneath the action, there is really no story or strong characters. Most of the characters are cliché: the ineffective officer in charge, the wisecracking grunts who spout obscenities at each other so we'll know they have a strong bond, the kid who is smarter than the adults, the saboteur (idea stolen from 'Alien').The other sci-fi action 80s films I mentioned above all have something going for them underneath the action, mainly multiple genres working together in perfect synergy and have distinct, interesting characters. They all explore to some degree the conflict between different beings and at the end of those films, there is a provocative open-endedness and ambiguity that still resonates today. 'Aliens' is just action...that's it!",5,13,29,5 October 2009
Saw III," The best SAW sequel!
","I believe the original SAW to be one of the most influential, creative horror films in recent years. I kind of liked SAW II and upon further viewing it gains points with me for being different from I, but having a solid story within itself, but I think it was the fact that II almost seemed ignore what happened in I and appeared like a totally different almost not even tied to I, except for the return of the character of Amanda and her role in the SAW franchise. Now, with part III, it all comes together! I see where II was going! And SAW III is even more satisfying than II because it forms a great 'conclusion' to the 'trilogy'. I know there has been a IV and V since, but they both go too far with the SAW concept as far as I'm concerned. It should have ended with III.Picking up about 6 months after the events of II, SAW III continues the story of John AKA Jigsaw (who was revealed as the villain at the end of SAW and Amanda (revealed as Jigsaw's apprentice at the end of SAW II). John/Jigsaw again is played superbly by Tobin Bell, who now belongs in the pantheon of the likes of Norman Bates, Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers. What makes John unique is that, unlike horror-movie killers of the last 30 years or so, he is portrayed as a functioning sociopath with an actual purpose and a rather focused vision: that people not take life for granted. Shawnee Smith again comes through as Amanda, who I thought was the most memorable character from part I. Now we get to see her character fleshed out and see her and John's relationship in full focus.John has Amanda kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (played impressively by sexy newcomer Bahar Soomekh). Lynn is a brilliant ER surgeon, but seems to have a terrible personal life and is highly depressed. John needs Lynn to operate on him as his brain tumor is worsening and he is now bed-ridden. Scared out of her mind now by this situation, Lynn must comply as Amanda has placed a bullet-riddled contraption around her neck that if John dies, it goes off and she dies too! In a parallel story, John has taken Jeff (excellently portrayed by Angus Macfayden), another emotional basket-case who has recently lost his son, killed by a drunk driver, who was let off with a light sentence. John must navigate through his 'emotional' trap of getting over his need for revenge on the people who are responsible for his rage (the driver, an eyewitness who said nothing, and the judge who let the driver go free).The connection to III and I is that 2 people are imprisoned in one way or another and take life for granted. But here, both Lynn and Jeff are much more psychologically damaged than our protagonists Dr. Gordon and Adam in I. Of course there is a twist! Actually, there are 2 big twists! One of them occurs smack dab in the middle of the film and I like this one even better than the final twist, which is a doozy! While part I focused a lot on style and was short on exposition, this one digs deep into the psyche of it's 4 characters and involves us deeply into the experience.Also, like in I, part III uses flashback sequences as part of the storytelling, but in I, the flashbacks were used more stylistically and dominated the film. Whereas here in III, the flashbacks are told in a more traditional fashion and placed at just the right time for just the right amount of exposition. But that is purposeful as each film has a different presentation: I was intended to be stylish, gimmicky, and nonlinear, whereas III has a story to tell. Again, the acting in III is exceptional. With a deeply involving story, SAW III is a highly welcome addition to the SAW franchise!",9,0,1,11 August 2009
The Usual Suspects," A maddeningly meticulous and crafty film!
","My top 10 films of the 90s EASILY include this film, THE USUAL SUSPECTS. I remember seeing it shortly after it first came out in 1995 and being enthralled by the story, dialogue, and characters, then came the punchline at the end! No matter, I still think of it as a fascinating piece of film-making. Because of the trick ending, it is debatable as to what is real or not in the film. If you watch it objectively, it is just a damn entertaining, complex, well-plotted film noir piece with an exciting climax. If you take the subjective route, which you pretty much have to because of the ending, then what you've got is perhaps the most puzzling film ever made, one that even with multiple repeated viewings will make you second (and third and fourth, etc.) guess yourself. Regardless, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is one spectacular film! THE USUAL SUSPECTS starts off with the film's supposed protagonist, Dean Keaton (terrifically played by Gabriel Byrne), being assassinated by a mysterious figure (unseen to the viewer) named 'Keyser'. I think it's safe to say that this opening scene is objectively told. It really happened. Then Keyser burns the ship that Keaton and a bunch of other men (who we find out about later) are on. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the cops and FBI question the sole survivor of this massacre, Verbal Kint (played by Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Kevin Spacey). Verbal is the only one who can tell what happened. He is our link to the story of THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Leading the investigation is US Customs Agent Dave Kujon (effectively played by Chazz Palmentieri). Kujon grills Kint relentlessly in order to piece together all the events that led up to the massacre. Kint begins with the events weeks before when Kujon and his fellow agents had arrested Keaton and the other 'usual' suspects Kint, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). These 5 men were suspected of a hijacking and were brought in for questioning.As Kint continues and the film progresses, we find that the 5 criminals were manipulated into the situation by Keyser Soze, a Hungarian uber-gangster/drug dealer who they all think is really a myth until his #1 lackey Kobyashi (played with cold efficiency by Pete Posthlewaite) pays them a visits after their release from jail and tells them that indeed Soze is behind all this. Soze wants them to to do job for him by killing his Hungarian competitors, who are making a huge drug deal with some Argentinians on a ship docked in LA. This leads us to the climax and back to the events that started the film.THE USUAL SUSPECTS, whatever one's feelings about the surprise at the end, is one brilliant example of modern day film noir. Nobody is innocent, yet every major character is multi-dimensional and draws you into the story. There is quite a bit of action and violence, but it is tight, well-placed, and quite convincing. The beauty of the film is that you can watch it at least two different ways: objectively to be entertained and subjectively to try to figure out what the heck is really going on! The acting is uniformly superb, the Oscar-winning screenplay crackles, and the film is NEVER dull. One of the best of the 90s!",10,0,0,13 July 2008
Die Hard 2," Severely unequal sequel!
","DIE HARD 2 is a prime example that, in terms of film-making, in general, you can't top the original. Resistance is essentially futile! Hindsight and retrospect is a son of a gun! There have been many cases where I was immediately fooled by a sequel that had more packed in it (longer, bigger, more characters, more effects, more action, etc.) thinking with something other than my common sense! When I first saw DIE HARD 2 back in 1990 (the year it came out), I thought:'Oh, it's not confined to that building and is instead in a big airport (Dulles), so it's got to be better! 'McClane gets to move around more, doesn't have to walk around barefoot, gets to interact with a lot of people, so it will be less uncomfortable.''The action can be more spread out and is not restrictive. So it's got to be better.'Wrong, wrong, and wrong!Again, with hindsight and repeated viewing, DIE HARD 2 continually gets downgraded by me as what is wrong with most Hollywood action movies, especially nowadays.What I realize is that part of the brilliance of the original DIE HARD was it's claustrophobic nature and that by limiting the action to that one skyscraper, it allows everything to be more personal, centrally located, and focused. You had to have everything happen in that one building, so you couldn't cheat or fool the audience. By design, the filmmakers had to come up with original ideas. In a situation like DIE HARD 2, there is action HERE, THERE, and EVERYWHERE to the point of just a bunch of the same action scenes, each with non-quotable, stupid dialogue and one-liners. The action in DIE HARD 2 is not unique, nor are any of the situations scary or tense, as they were in DIE HARD.Our hero is once again John McClane (played by the reliable action hero Bruce Willis, but this time in a thankless situation) and as previously stated, he is at Dulles Airport in D.C. waiting his wife Holly's (Bonnie Bedelia again) arriving plane so they can meet her parents for Christmas. A bad snowstorm has caused so that even planes at nearby airports must re-route to Dulles. This time, as opposed to in the original DIE HARD, these terrorists are actual terrorists, a group of U.S. military expatriates who plan to seize control of Dulles and force them to have the plane of a political prisoner routed to a special runway. This group is led by Col. Stuart (played by William Sadler). This is another huge problem with DIE HARD 2. The main villain is not effective. While in DIE HARD, Hans Gruber was truly diabolical, smart, charming, and relentless, Stuart in DIE HARD 2 is pretty much just a stock villain who has an eternal scowl on his face with no distinguishing characteristics. Very monotone character. Also, Stuart strangely doesn't seem to be fazed or surprised about McClane's involvement in trying to stop him, which I find unrealistic.Another problem is that whereas DIE HARD had a core of memorable supporting characters (Holly, Hans, Karl, Powell, Robinson, Thornburg, etc.) each with some character believability and depth, DIE HARD 2 is populated with virtually all annoying characters (the airport personnel led by Fred Dalton Thompson and Dennis Franz are spectacularly idiotic; at least in DIE HARD, even though Robinson wasn't too bright, he had legitimate reason to believe that McClane might not be on the up and up; these airport guys had no excuse, so why waste the whole 2 hours arguing with him!). Also, I found most of the more minor characters like the flight attendants on Holly's plane, the female news reporter following McClane around like his pet, that creepy drunk guy working in the underground part of the airport, etc. all annoying.Then you have John Amos (playing an Army major and a former colleague of Col. Stuart's) and his military squad pop in to save the day at the last minute, but again, it is not exciting or tense at all. In fact, with all the action in DIE HARD 2, none of it is thrilling, just by-the-numbers fare: fake-looking fights and machine guns going off all over the place, but without the style, flair, and, dare I say, 'realism' of DIE HARD. The action situations in the original were more sparse, believable, and well-staged.But the biggest offense of DIE HARD 2 is the cringe-inducing dialogue. It is really bad. One of the reasons many of the characters come off so bland, monotone, and annoying. I mean, it is unintentionally laughable. ALL characters are a victim to it. And finally, amazingly, although it came out only 2 years later, this sequel seems way more dated than the original. In fact, the original doesn't seem dated at all to me. DIE HARD 2 is just a mindless action flick.",3,14,24,19 June 2009
Dirty Dancing," Lightning-in-a-bottle cult classic from the 80s!
","I first saw DIRTY DANCING (1987) when it came out and it was just like any other 80s flick for me at that time, just basic entertainment. This is one of my Mom's favorite movies and I had to re-watch it to see why she loves it and it holds such a special place in the hearts of many cult fans. Some movies just WORK! And Dirty Dancing is one of those movies. It is an anomaly of a film, set in the early 60s at a summer resort, but with a definite 80s vibe hovering over it, since it came out in '87 and features several popular 80s songs on it's soundtrack, one of which is actually used in the film's concluding explosive dance sequence, the Oscar-winning tune 'The Time of My Life'.The film stars the electrifying duo of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, both general unknowns at the time, who seem to be perfectly cast for these roles. Ironically, it was well-publicized that the two immensely disliked each other prior to filming DD because of some troubles they had on a previous flick they had done 2 years prior Red Dawn. But, thankfully, they worked out their differences and, thus, this timeless cult dance-romance movie was born! In analyzing the acting, while Grey is wonderful as the innocent main character 'Baby' (whose family is vacationing at the resort), it is truly Swayze who steals the show in an utterly convincing and brilliant performance as the very masculine and charismatic dance master Johnny! Swayze's Johnny is so authentic as an extremely gifted, hard-working and talented man (employed by the resort to give dance lessons), who is used, manipulated, and mistreated by the uppity summer residents, that it hurts to watch at times. Swayze truly conveys Johnny's pain and desire for a better existence. Grey's Baby provides that turning point in his life. Grey herself is pretty convincing as a 17-year old (even she was actually in her mid-20s at the time).I'm actually not a big fan of movies whose major plots are romance or love stories, but this one is probably my favorite one of all time! The Johnny-Baby romance feels natural and real, not contrived at all. Initially having a bumpy relationship and interactions, they slowly develop a mutual admiration, respect, and love for each other. They complement each other and bring out previously hidden and untapped qualities. Johnny unleashes Baby's underlying sex appeal (and dancing ability!), while Baby gives Johnny more confidence in himself and more trust that there are decent people in the world, not to mention the most important thing...TRUE LOVE!80s flicks had a tendency to use soundtracks a lot for montages, but DD does it better than any I can recall, underscoring several Baby-Johnny scenes where Johnny is teaching Baby to dance, my favorites being the 'Hungry Eyes' montage and the 'Lover Boy' scene of Baby teasing Johnny and Johnny playing along. These music-montage scenes actually propel the story as much as the purely dialog scenes.The supporting cast is good, including an effective Jerry Orbach as Baby's Dad, real-life dancer Cynthia Rhodes (from Staying Alive) as Johnny's former dance partner who has been impregnated by one of the other resort workers and Baby must take her place as Johnny's partner, a funny Jane Brucker as Baby's daffy older sister Lisa, and Jack Weston as the resort manager.DD is also an 80s flick that avoids the dreaded 'dated' tag due to it being set in the 60s and capturing the vibe of that decade very well, and the film still looks very modern and vibrant, with crisp visuals, not cheap-looking like a lot of 80s flicks. A very breezy, entertaining, and romantic creation of the 80s, DIRTY DANCING is timeless!",10,0,0,10 March 2012
Independence Day," Forefather to TRANSFORMERS
","If you want to know the partial inspiration for the most recent TRANSFORMERS movie, look no further than this 1996 movie INDEPENDENCE DAY. On a lark, I watched ID4 recently again and it is just as bad as I remember it to be back in 1996. Both movies are very similar in that they have a host of annoying, poorly written characters and overly confusing action sequences. In ID4 the action is a tad more coherent, but strangely limited and kind of boring upon repeated viewing. When I originally saw it, I thought the action was the only good part of the movie. Still true, but not saying much.The story of ID4 is that aliens float down to attack and destroy earth (yadda yadda yadda) and so a core group of humans must band together and brainstorm to defeat them (sound familiar?). Should, because this is the plot of TRANSFORMERS. Of course, as in TRANSFORMERS, a secret part of the gov't knew about the aliens for years already. In ID4, it is the infamous Area 51 (it was Section 7 or something in TRANSFORMERS). The band of heroes include the Pres. and some of his staff, the military (or what is left of it), a computer genius and his crew, and a bunch of nomadic volunteers who SOMEHOW found Area 51! The actors? ID4 stars Will Smith. I'll admit I don't like Smith, but I have opened my mind with several actors and liked them in certain films because I was impressed with their work, even if I didn't like them overall. THIS is not the film to make me like Will Smith! This movie is precisely the reason I don't like him. Playing Air Force Capt. Hiller, Smith is overly cocky, shouts at EVERYONE, and delivers really bad one-liners that make you cringe. I will say, I did like Smith in the original BAD BOYS (ironic b/c Michael Bay directed that movie and he also directed TRANSFORMERS, which I'm connecting to ID4).Smith isn't the only actor who comes away unscathed. Bill Pullman is terrible as the President, just plain bad. He speaks at a slur/whispery tone throughout and I actually think he is supposed to be a tough guy! Conveniently, the Pres. is a former 'fighter pilot' (haven't heard them called that since the 1940s!) and he lead the final July 4th attack against the space invaders. Other victims to the bad acting bug are Brent Spiner (STAR TREK:TNG's Data) looks bad as the Area 51 top scientist who experiments on the aliens to find out how to kill them, Robert Loggia (a usually reliable character actor) as the Pres. top military adviser, Judd Hirsch as an all-too Jewish father to a key person in the film; I'll mention later), Margaret Colin as the Pres. press secretary (who has an obvious crush on him!), Randy Quaid as a bumpkiny cropduster (convenient that he knows how to fly a plane!), and Jeff Golblum (really the film's third lead behind Smith and Pullman) as a brilliant computer nerd (and Colin's ex-husband and Hirsch's son).I mentioned Goldblum last for a reason: he is actually the only character watchable in this! How Goldblum comes away from this smelling like a rose is amazing. He actually abandons all that jittery, hesitant acting style that he is famous for and pretty much plays it straight and looks good compared to everyone else. And he actually has funny lines that aren't unintentionally funny, but actually funny.Interestingly also, ID4 is a fairly dated looking film that I've seen it recently. The special effects are surprisingly cheesy for a late 90s film. But the biggest clunker in this whole thing is HOW the humans defeated the aliens (a computer virus!). Sooo convenient that a simple earth virus could disrupt the central database of a highly advanced alien race. The 'band of heroes' synchronizes the virus implant (headed by Smith and Goldblum, who use the Area 51 spaceship to fly into the mothercraft hovering above earth) with the figther attack (led by you know who!) so they can penetrate the alien armor and defeat them.Pretty neat, huh? Well, ID4 is the 90s version of movies like TRANSFORMERS, which insults the viewers intelligence with an empty plot and poorly drawn characters. I hear people all the time say that 'it is supposed to be mindless fluff' or 'it's just a movie' or 'at least the action is great' or 'enjoy it for what it is'. That's fine to a degree, but a movie ought to have a semblance that the filmmakers actually put real effort into what translated to the screen. The makers of ID4 did not.",3,1,2,18 June 2009
Remember the Titans," Soft, phony, and a HARD watch!
","In the last decade, I've realized that perhaps the most difficult 'genre' of movie to make work is the SPORTS movie! Not only are there only probably a handful of 'great' sports films in the history of cinema, there are really very few 'good' sports movies (relative to how many sports films that have been made). Really, the 1980s is the end of the era of even good sports movies (and most of them about baseball!). It was officially over and done with then.All the so-called major sports flicks made in the last 10 years are pretty much formulaic and follow the same recipe: tell the tale of a bunch of downtrodden, undertalented (yet scrappy!) 'brothers' who band together to pull off the impossible...win the big game! And I actually think that this film that I'm reviewing REMEMBER THE TITANS (2000) started this new trend of rather formulaic, soft-headed, cheesy sports movies of the last decade, which include WE ARE MARSHALL and GLORY ROAD, all of which were supposed to be 'fact-based' movies. The problem with all these movies is that, while they may have gotten the very general details correct (character names, opponent mantres, era costumes, etc.), all these films fail where it really counts: character, dialogue, and story.Set in a 1971 D.C. suburb and starring Denzel Washington (who really had gotten long in the tooth at this point in his career!) plays yet another typical in-your-face, take-no-junk, proud black man, a hodgepodge of pretty much all the characters he had played up to that point in his career, and it's annoying! Virtually all the characters in REMEMBER THE TITANS (including Washington) are all one-dimensional and cliché. The ever reliable Will Patton does his best to overcome a thankless role as the white assistant coach that Washington's character deposes (and pretty much runs over for the entire movie!); of course Patton's character turns out to be a closet liberal and completely understanding of the man who took HIS job from him! Hayden Pannietierre, as Patton's annoyingly spunky and super-smart daughter certainly shows talent for a child actor (at the time), but what kid in the history of the world has ever acted like this?! Then you have a bunch of nameless, one-note footballers and assistant coaches of both races who somehow learn to LOVE each other! The absolutely most annoying character was that faux-gay transfer surfer dude from California, who is one of the weirdest characters ever to grace the movie screen!The only tolerable characters in the film are played by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as the prospective leaders of the white and black players and help bring them all together. Their personal relationship is actually authentic (thus the extra star!), but everything surrounding them is NOT! In real life (which this movie is supposed to be based on), even post 60s (1971 to be exact), I find it hard to believe that opposite races would have hated each other so vehemently at the start of the film, only to end up getting along so famously by the end of it, especially on a team that was literally FORCED to be together!",2,11,23,27 March 2011
Batman Begins," Extremely competent, exciting reboot of the BATMAN franchise
","Got to admit, I did NOT want to like Christopher Nolan's film version BATMAN BEGINS (2005), a retelling of the Batman legend. Mainly because I love Tim Burton's highly original, groundbreaking films BATMAN (1989) and BATMAN RETURNS (1992). Well, Christopher Nolan did well with BATMAN BEGINS, a strong, provocative, sprawling epic retelling of how a conflicted young man, Bruce Wayne, battled his inner demons and conquered his deepest fears to emerge into a crime-fighting hero Batman.Christian Bale is excellent as young Bruce Wayne and, while I still think Michael Keaton is the best, I can accept Bale because this is the young version of Bruce Wayne and telling how he emerged into Batman whereas in Burton's films, Batman was already established. Also, the tone of Burton's flicks were more lighthearted, even though they were still rather dark films. Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS is more realistic and serious, but it still works. Again, Bale really gives a strong performance in this film displaying a variety of emotions with conviction and depth.The early stages of BATMAN BEGINS are told in random fashion. The film starts showing Wayne being trained in Tibet by ninja warrior Henri Ducard (wonderfully played by the superb Liam Neeson). Both Wayne and Ducard are students of Ras Al Ghul (larger-than-life Ken Watanabe). Wayne is being trained in all facets of martial artistry to make himself almost indestructible. Flashback to Wayne's childhood. As a boy, young Bruce is friends with Rachel Dawes and while playing, he is attacked by bats. This manifests itself as extreme fear in Bruce, but his father Thomas Wayne (solid work by Linus Roache) instills in him that he must fight his fear. The scenes of young Bruce and his father are effectively touching without ever devolving into sappiness. And it shows how a father's guidance can help shape and mold a boy into manhood.Of course, we know what happens to Bruce's parents! Leaving the theatre one night, a random thug named Joe Chill kills Bruce's parents. A distraught young Wayne rebels and runs away scouring the world trying to understand the criminal mind. Fourteen years later, returning briefly for the parole hearing of Chill (he was caught soon after the murder), Wayne is going to kill Chill, but someone beats him to it. Crime boss Carmine Falcone (deliciously played by Tom Wilkinson) has Chill killed because he was going to testify against him. When Bruce admits to Rachel (excellent work by the underrated Katie Holmes) that he was going to kill Chill, she slaps him and tells him his father would be ashamed. I found this scene to be particularly effective. Holmes got way too much flack for her performance IMHO. She really brings a sweet innocence, yet some serious inner strength, to the role of Rachel Dawes. Plus, Bale and Holmes have great chemistry in this! Now, flashforward to the present and Wayne's training with Ducard and Al Ghul. They want him to go back and destroy Gotham with his newfound abilities and powers. It is then that Wayne realizes that Ducard and Al Ghul are no different than men like Chill and Falcone. They are all selfish, evil men who think the world is their playground. Wayne refuses and in the melee, destroys Al Ghuls temple, killing him, but saving Ducard.Upon returning to Gotham after a 7-year absence, Wayne re-establishes himself in the city. Respectively, we meet Wayne's butler Alfred (Michael Caine), Wayne Foundation Chairman Earle (Rutger Hauer), Wayne Foundation Development Head Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and Batman's future ally Police Sgt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). The veteran actors Caine, Hauer, Freeman, and Oldman are all superb in their roles and have an amazing rapport with the young Bale. There is a kind of dignified camaraderie amongst all these characters. Wayne has Fox introduce him to all those 'wonderful toys' that he will use in his new role as the Caped Crusader.After taking down Falcone, Batman must contend with the Scarecrow (brilliantly played by Cillian Murphy), who was in cahoots with Falcone and, as it turns out, Ducard (the real Ras Al Ghul!), who has been plotting his revenge against Wayne and Gotham City.BATMAN BEGINS really does good job of jumpstarting the Batman story, while still having satisfying doses of action and humor along the way. The cast is uniformly excellent and the humor really emerges out of the dialogue and is not forced at all. Nolan does fantastic job of having a serious, realistic tone, but yet BATMAN BEGINS never seems boring. A couple of complaints:*The action scenes, while exciting and visually arresting, are kind of difficult to discern at times, especially at the climax. In Burton's films, the action was exciting while still being discernible. I know this is a function of the ninja-warrior like training of Wayne, but when he fought Al Ghul's ninja warriors at the climax, I felt that action should have been slowed down since they all had the same abilities. I felt cheated by that scene, which should have been better.*I think Bale as the REAL Bruce Wayne (not the ineffectual playboy) is way more interesting than Bale as Batman! It's OK here since Bruce Wayne has much more screen time than Batman, which is the opposite of Burton's films where Keaton's Batman definitely had more scenes than Keaton's Wayne. Also, I liked the fact that Keaton as Bruce Wayne was ALWAYS the real Bruce Wayne, a reclusive billionaire. I think they could have pulled that off with Bale, too. The playboy stuff seemed kind of tacked on and didn't come across well. I find Bale's Batman, with his super raspy voice and cowering like a real bat to be a tad odd at times!But, overall, this is definitely a well-executed, provocative, well acted film which happens to be about a superhero!",10,0,0,4 October 2009
Twilight," Huh...you know, it's not as bad as I thought!
","OK, so I'm trying to be very OBJECTIVE for this review of TWILIGHT (2008). It's difficult because I literally heard every bad thing possible about this movie, the actors, and the series BEFORE I actually got a chance to see for myself! I've seen youtube clips mocking it in the form of parodies and riffing and everyone under the sun trashing it. YET, amidst all the bashing, there are still a LOT of fans of this franchise!I first saw the IMDb rating recently and...5.5?! For such a big movie that is this popular and such of a moneymaker, I thought 5.5 is a stunningly low rating! TRANSFORMERS is at 7.2, but that movie is a formulaic summer blockbuster with noise, splosions, and awful dialogue, all courtesy of the 'great' Michael Bay! I like to make my own informed decisions. Frankly, IMDb is not the most reliable source for what are the best movies (the irony!). I just can't rationalize why manipulative crap like THE DARK KNIGHT is at 8.9, while movies that I KNOW are good like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is lingering at 6.9! I think I know the reason why TWILIGHT is so low at 5.5. The main plot that drives the film, the 'Romeo-Juliet' teen romance, is the weakest point of the movie! With corny dialogue overemphasis on angst, it really is a movie FOR teen girls. It just doesn't have the mass appeal of a typical summer action movie does. Yet it's a hugely popular series. And I guess that speaks to the power of teen girls! Now, having seen the sequels, especially ECLIPSE there's actually some stuff in there for the boys, too.Back to TWILIGHT. Now, THE main problem with the movie (and series, frankly) is a doozy...the central character Bella Swan is truly the MOST boring character! I think that Bella is supposed to be this shy, lonely teenager, which actually makes sense that she'd fit in with the vampire crowd, but I don't know if it's casting, writing, or both, but Kristen Stewart just acts very poorly. Bella is literally a one-note character. She oddly seems soulless. It's hard to believe she has any friends (she actually has a significant number in this!) or would inspire a vampire to violate his coven's code! I mean, I just think Stewart's acting is too lazy. I felt like the character should have some signs of defiance and spunk in her, but she just reacts to everything around her. I just don't get why everyone is so enamored of her. Now, I know Stewart is a good actress because I've seen her do great work in OTHER movies! Maybe she wasn't prepared to carry a franchise like this one.I had to watch this movie a couple of times to really make an informed decision about the plusses, but there are some things that I think are done fairly well: *Robert Pattinson is well-cast as Edward Cullen. I think people over-focus on the mumbling vampire side of Edward (which makes sense as he's probably never tried to connect to any human in 100 years!), but what I think people overlook is that Pattinson does an amazing job with the American accent. Not just that, he really has the 'teen' thing going, too. He has moments where he's very convincing as a typical 17-year old American male (he was 22 when this film came out) and that couldn't have been easy to pull off for a semi-adult distinguished Brit! I found myself enjoying Edward's 'teen' moments much more than his vampire ones. And in terms of the vampire part, I blame that squarely on Stewart and her underacting as Bella! I mean, Pattinson must have had a difficult time trying to pull any kind of emotion acting off of such a bland character! I think Pattinson gets a bad rap.*The Cullen vampire clan! I really enjoyed this family in the movie, what little screen time they had. Honestly, they may have been cast for their looks, but the actors Peter Facinelli (as family head Dr. Carlisle Cullen), Elizabeth Reaser (as Carlisle's wife Esme), Nikki Reed (Rosalie), Ashley Greene (Alice), Jackson Rathbone (Jasper), and Kellan Lutz (Emmett) do a great job with what little they have to work with, all I think getting at the heart of the characters that novelist Stephanie Wright had in mind. Frankly, I wish this family were fleshed out a bit more in this movie, rather than the Edward-Bella romance being such a huge focus. My favorite scene is when Edward introduces Bella to the Cullens and Edward's embarrassed reactions to his family's 'vampiric awkwardness' was very funny. I really liked how they didn't overdo 'the vampire look' of the Cullens in the movie, pale, but not too pale with dark brown eyes to relay to the audience that they were all just a bit 'different' from everyone else.*Some of the dialogue is actually pretty self-deprecating and funny, taking advantage of common vampire myths and kind of slamming the door on them!*The story itself is OK I think. Bella-Edward have to establish a connection first, the Cullens have be established as earnest and not bloodthirsty vamps and have to slowly accept Bella into the fold and Edward's love for her, Bella has to hide all this from her human friends and her Dad Charlie (played well by Billy Burke).Again, the elephant in the room is the tepid romance of Bella and Edward. I feel like it's very forced and hard to believe. Much of their dialogue and interaction is oddly stale so it forces the viewer to take at face value that there is just this strong unbreakable bond between them. Pattinson somehow rises above it to make Edward real...Stewart doesn't for Bella. And one half of a whole ain't good enough!",5,0,2,27 May 2011
Gone Girl," Brilliant, twisted satire!
","David Fincher might now be on my short list of directors where I can name at least 3 films that I consider brilliant! The first is 1997's 'The Game', an early effort of Fincher's that I think many forget about. The second is 2010's 'The Social Network', which should have won Best Picture that year. And now there's this excellent offering GONE GIRL (2014), which in my opinion has more than lived up to the hype and acclaim. In fact, I dare say that 'Gone Girl' was shamelessly overlooked at the Oscars. 'Gone Girl' stars Ben Affleck in arguably the best performance of his career thus far. Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a failed writer forced to move from New York back to his small Missouri hometown due to financial trouble coupled with his mother's health problems. Accompanied by Nick is his wife Amy (brilliantly essayed by Rosamund Pike in a well-deserved Best Actress nominated performance). Financial woes cause Nick and Amy to have a very strained marriage. Amy gets money from her wealthy parents in order for Nick to buy a local bar that is co-run by Nick and his twin sister Margo (pitch perfect performance by Carrie Coon). Very early in the film, Nick discovers their home ransacked and Amy missing and calls the cops. The lead investigator is Det. Rhonda Boney (excellently played by Kim Dickens) and her partner is Off. Jim Gilpin (cheekily played by Patrick Fugit of 'Almost Famous' fame). Boney implores Nick to contact Amy's uppercrust parents (fine performances by David Clennon and Lisa Banes) from New York to fly down to Missouri. The cops and family set up a headquarters and the search for Amy begins.Of course Nick is soon the main suspect in the investigation and it's not long before he must enlist the aid of media-loving defense lawyer Tanner Bolt (played with flair and confidence by Tyler Perry). The investigation into Amy's disappearance jumpstarts the film's storytelling structure, which involves many flashbacks of Amy and Nick's encounters both pre and during marriage. The segues between past and present are done in a seamless way that I found refreshing. Not the traditional, obvious way of nonlinear storytelling. And Pike's superb narration of Amy's thoughts are a huge component of these flashbacks. A key figure that emerges during the case is Amy's high school sweetheart Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris in a strong, convincing turn). When I saw the trailers for this film, I expected it to be yet another twisty murder mystery with suspect after suspect and a cliché resolution. But it was far from that. In actuality, 'Gone Girl' is a stunning satirical swipe at marriage, male-female relationships (whether romantic, familial, or platonic), and the brainwashed society that we unfortunately all live in due to media manipulation. It not only takes a general jab at high-profile national cases like the Scott Peterson, Casey Anthony, and O.J. Simpson scandal-mysteries, but also works as an indictment on the stereotypical humdrum institution that is married life. 'Gone Girl' looks at the how and why everything went wrong. We never get that as casual observers of the biased reporting from network 'news'. This film shows us!The media part comes into play in the form of two key characters: a 'Nancy Grace' style national news anchor Ellen Abbott (wonderfully played by Missi Pyle) and an 'Oprah/Barbara Walters' style network interviewer Sharon Scheiber (solidly played by Sela Ward), both women who of course spin the story from Amy's point of view and try to paint Nick in an unflattering light as a cheating, abusive husband. The cheating part involves Andie Fitzgerald (hilariously played by Emily Ratajkowski), a 20-year old local college girl, one of Nick's students, that he is having an affair with. Another strong female character, Greta, is played with unapologetic sex appeal by Lola Kirke. I can't remember the last time that a film was filled with so many spot-on, perfectly cast female characters! And each of them have distinct enough personality to make them unique and interesting in their own way. The sharp, witty screenplay was adapted from the book, both penned by Gillian Flynn, who was robbed of a Best Screenplay nod. Fincher's direction is brilliant, another glaring oversight. The movie is 2.5 hours long and there's not a dull moment to be had watching it. That accomplishment alone deserves recognition by the Academy! Affleck is rock solid as the film's protagonist and I like how he sheds his clean, glamorous, hero image to play a rather put-upon, ineffectual, loser-ish, yet sympathetic character. I usually have a hard time believing such a recognizable, star actor in such an unflattering, low-key role, but Affleck pulled it off. Perry and Harris delivered strong, convincing performances as well. I would also say that both Coon and Dickens were robbed of Supporting Actress nods. At least Pike got a nomination for Best Actress and based off of her incredible work in this film, I'd say the Academy gave the Oscar to the wrong person yet again!",10,2,5,21 June 2015
Get Out," Good movie, but not THAT good!
","Jordan Peele hit the big time with this highly acclaimed and celebrated horror film GET OUT. I saw the movie in theatres when it first came out and while there were certain parts and performances that mightily impressed me, in some cases I wasn't that impressed. In particular, while breakout star Daniel Kaluuya received a well-deserved Best Actor nomination, I also thought that Catherine Keener should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She was intimidating, creepy perfection as the hypnotist mother of the main character's girlfriend, which was a well-played role by Allison Williams. Also, Betty Gabriel was superb as the dazed maid Georgina.Bradley Whitford was just OK as the 'cool' Dad character, but every role seems like he's playing the same smarmy jerkish character he's been playing for the last quarter century (and yeah I'm including Josh Lyman!). The hairy son was just a weirdo. But here's my main complaint: sorry, but Rod was a STUPID character and felt very out of place in this movie. I just can't take a guy seriously with his annoying meta commentary and juvenile dialogue. This character was more befitting being on a CW or Disney channel show, not a serious Oscar-nominated big screen film.While Peele did a great job crafting an interesting horror exercise with an original premise with a few strong performances and tight story, the uneven mixture of serious horror with such a silly side character like Rod almost sunk this movie for me. Also, I don't get what was so special about Peele's script for him to win an Oscar. I'm still perplexed as to how a certified horror masterpiece like The Conjuring got no major award nominations, while this so-so flick was lauded like it was. Get Out is a good movie, but best horror film of the decade? That honor goes to The Conjuring.",7,0,4,9 February 2020
Kick-Ass," A tad uneven, but pretty good and funny parody/homage
","Basically, KICK ASS (2010) is a modern-day ripoff of other modern-day ripoffs! From some of the reviews I've seen, they have said it is Superbad meets Kill Bill. Well, I have yet to see Superbad, so can't comment on that one, but I HAVE seen Kill Bill (from 2003), and it is one of my favorite films of the decade of the 00s, but just Part 1! This movie also noticeably has elements of Spiderman and Batman. Basically, it's a fusion of many superhero movies! Director Matthew Vaughn does noticeably borrow from Kill Bill, Part 1, with 'kick ass' action sequences that will definitely remind one of that film. Most of the big scenes involve the protagonist of the moment (either Kick Ass or Hit Girl or Big Daddy) single-handedly taking out a group of goons (a la The Bride in Kill Bill) and looking cool doing it. I really did like the musical choices that Vaughn made, which shows that he definitely learned well from Tarantino. Well, at least early Tarantino!Many of the reviews rave about 13-year old Chloe Moretz (who plays Mindy MacReady, aka Hit Girl) and Moretz is definitely terrific in the role, showing amazing acting chops for such a young actress. But I was also impressed by star Aaron Johnson (Dave Lizewski, aka the title character Kick Ass). As high-schooler Dave/Kick Ass, Johnson really created a sympathetic, relatable character that matured throughout the film in a realistic way. I look forward to the sequel (c'mon, you know there will be one!) where Hit Girl has to teach Kick Ass the art of being a superhero! The story of KICK ASS is that social outcast Dave, who recently lost his Mom, is frustrated by the inaction of society and his loser status, so he embarks on a mission to be a superhero called 'Kick Ass'. With his ebay-ordered costume and a pair of numchucks, Kick Ass first attempt at hero is met with disaster, as he gets stabbed by a pair of thugs. Once recovered, Dave becomes popular with his school crush Katie (a charming, beautiful Lyndsy Fonseca), who thinks he is gay. Dave plays the part in order to be friends and stay close to Katie, while re-embarking on his superhero adventures. Dave also has 2 nerdy friends Marty and Todd (hilariously played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters), who live vicariously through both Dave and Kick Ass.The adult cast is led by none other than famous Nicolas Cage, who wonderfully essays the role of Damon MacReady, aka Big Daddy. Cage pretty much riffs on his own well-known movie persona as you'll see many characters (both good and bad!) in his portrayal; Cage's Big Daddy persona is essentially a copy of Adam West's Batman from the 1960s and it is a hoot! The aforementioned Moretz plays Big Daddy's daughter and partner in superhero-dom Hit Girl. The scenes of Cage quizzing Moretz are really funny and witty.Also great are Mark Strong (as the movie's main villain gangster Frank D'Amico)and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as his eager-to-please teen son Chris, aka Red Mist). The movie is very well-cast.The dialogue is by-the-numbers and simple, yet still very witty and entertaining to listen to. There are a few cheesy parts, but by and large, it's a funny script. Part of the minuses for me were that at times the movie feels like an odd mix of realism and fantasy, as well as comedy and violence. On the one hand, you have the all-too-realistic scenes with Kick Ass, but then you have the over-the-top, flashy stuff of Hit Girl. Also, there is real disturbing violence in this movie, including a death by fire that is hard to watch, and the aforementioned stabbing. No way can someone take their kids to see a movie like this, yet the main characters are kids! But, KICK ASS is definitely one of the better done homages I've seen in a while and the cast is very engaging and does a fine job with a solid script. KICK ASS...I'll recommend it, but only for adults!",8,1,4,30 June 2011
Ghostbusters," One of the 5 funniest films ever!
","I recently posted on one of the boards here my top 5 comedies ever and GHOSTBUSTERS made the list. And this was not some off-the-top-of-my-head choice b/c I couldn't think of anything else. It was solid! I hadn't seen the film in a while, but it remained fresh in my memory as being utterly funny and special. Being an 80s movie, it's got that general 80s vibe going (for it, IMHO). But yet it doesn't feel or seem nearly as dated as a lot of 80s movies, I think mainly b/c of how amazing the special effects are and how plain funny it is. I think the special effects are the key: they make GHOSTBUSTERS seem otherworldly, like you are watching a parallel universe version of New York City, but still New York. It's just different from the typical 80s movie, not just in terms of plot, but also in terms of look, tone, and feel.GHOSTBUSTERS is just plain funny. At the heart of all the humor is one Mr. Bill Murray. The man is a comic genius! He's so smarmy, sardonic, and cocksure that he exudes hilarity. These so-called comic actors nowadays have barely a speck of the comic delivery and timing that Murray possesses. It's really kind of sad b/c Murray should have been getting Oscar nods for stuff like GHOSTBUSTERS, not LOST IN TRANSLATION. It's a shame that a great comic actor has to resort being in dramatic hogwash in order to get recognized by the bozos at the Academy Awards! Murray has sterling support in the form of Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis, Annie Potts, Rick Moranis, and Ernie Hudson. Actually, Ackroyd and Ramis wrote the screenplay for GHOSTBUSTERS and have spun a confident yarn. It's amazing that they can believably deliver these lines with straight faces! 'Gozer'! 'the Keymaster'! 'Zhoul!' The director Ivan Reitman has done a superlative job. The climactic ending is one of the best ever put to screen. Many comedies, heck movies in general, tend to fall apart in the 3rd act, but not GHOSTBUSTERS. The conclusion is just as satisfying as the first part of the film.One of the funniest, most confident films that you will ever see in any genre! GHOSTBUSTERS!",10,0,0,27 July 2008
The Hurt Locker," Absorbing character study set during the Iraq war
","THE HURT LOCKER won the Best Picture Oscar of 2009. It also made history in that Kathryn Bigelow, it's director, became the first female to win the coveted Best Director Oscar. Right off the bat, I have to say that I think she deserved this award. The direction is definitely expert. Bigelow keeps the action at just the right pace and every scene is the right length. There is just the right amount of character exposition also. Actually, not much is revealed about the main characters SSG Will James (Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner), SGT JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and SPC Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). It is a straightforward tale of men in the most tense combat situations. James, Sanborn, and Eldridge are a 3-man Explosives Ordnance Division (EOD). Their job is to diffuse bombs. James is the EOD expert who did the diffusing and Sanborn and Eldridge were his security and point men.What struck me most about this film is how tense EVERY scene was! I found even what should have been the most unassuming scene very tension-filled as I realized that these men live on the edge every second of every day. The bomb-diffusing scenes are all very exciting and tension-filled and not just because of the impending doom of a bomb exploding, but due to the unknown factor of whether it is a timed bomb, or if there is a trigger man nearby. Any Iraqi in the vicinity was a suspect and not to be trusted. There is a very tense scene in the middle of the film that ironically has nothing to do with diffusing a bomb, but still is an 'action' scene, and I found it to be the most tense, powerful scene of the film.Renner definitely deserved his Oscar nomination, and perhaps should have won. It's not a showy role at all, but he makes the most of it. He plays the role very close to the vest. He simply IS SFC Will James, a man who is perhaps TOO good at what he does to the point that he gets lost in it sometimes and forgets others around him, due to the gravity of what he does. He kind of comes off as a modern cowboy and a wild man of sorts. He gets a rush out of what he does and then tops it all off at the end of the day with a smoke and a drink and doesn't get phased or let his emotions get in the way of his mission.Mackie (as Sanborn) and Geraghty (as Eldgridge) are very solid in their roles also and are given their moments to shine as well. Eldridge suffers from immense stress as he must interact with the camp psychiatrist Lt. Col Cambridge (a solid, straight-laced Christian Camargo) on a daily basis when he comes back to the rear. Geraghty gets to play a very emotional scene early in the film where Eldgridge recounts the opening film scene where one choice by him could have made the difference between life and death. Sanborn is a by-the-numbers grunt who just wants to get the job done with a minimum of fuss; while at first he kind of resents and dislikes James, through the course of the film, he gains a healthy respect for James's professionalism, bravery, and leadership skills. The last scene between Mackie and Renner late in the film in the Humvee is extremely provocative and powerful as each man essentially reveals what the war has done to them.The film also has 3 big-name cameos in Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes in small, but pivotal roles and these actors do a great job with their small parts. The original screenplay (by Mark Boal)also won an Oscar and I think it deserved it as well. While the dialogue is nothing new, it is very realistic and convincing and there are actually moments of legitimate humor at the most perfect times that comes out of it. This actually seems like the way that these guys would interact and talk to each other. The focus is strictly on these 3 men, especially James, so this is much more of a tight character study than a treatise on war, although it definitely makes a powerful statement about what combat does to a soldier.I find most of today's war films somewhat overrated. Seems like they either try to do too much with a lot of hard to follow action, heavy breathing, and shaky camera movement (like BLACKHAWK DOWN) or they are extremely downbeat and underdone (like JARHEAD). But THE HURT LOCKER manages to avoid these clichés and essentially be honest and truthful about the way men would act. Again, it's not about the Iraq war...It's about men at war.The film itself is not even really a commentary on the war in Iraq. It just shows us what these men go through in their day-to-day grind, but it doesn't pontificate and become preachy. The film moves in one direction and doesn't stall at any point to become boring. THE HURT LOCKER is a superb character driven drama with immensely tense and riveting situations that just happen to take place in the Iraq war.",10,36,56,15 March 2010
Transformers," Very uneven; just barely entertaining
","TRANSFORMERS is a long, 'epic' film that unfortunately is an example of what is wrong with a lot of movies nowadays. I just find them very big on special effects, and very small on character development or even entertainment value. And that's the irony b/c it is all these great modern special effects, the CGI type stuff, that is supposed to blow the audience away. But I find it all very distracting and overdone.TRANSFORMERS has a promising start w/ a prologue describing the longstanding battle between aliens from a faraway planet, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons and why they must bring their battle to Earth to find a mysterious cube that will affect Earth's future. The action is immediate as a Decepticon advanced party attack force destroys an American military outpost in the Qatar desert, leaving a few surviving soldiers who band together to try to get word to the Pentagon of the impending attack. This group is led by Capt. Lennox (played by modern day hunk Josh Duhamel, who is stuck with a thankless role).Meanwhile, 2 other parallel stories are told. One is the Pentagon itself who are aware of the Qatar attack, but only have the recording of a strange, foreign signal from the attack to go by. The Defense Secretary (played by Jon Voight who dons an unnecessary Southern accent) musters together a group of expert computer hackers from around the world to decode the signal. The best of these hackers is Maggie Madsen (Australian sexpot Rachael Taylor; is she supposed to be a high school student?!), who quickly figures out that the signal is alien and warns the Secretary of impending attack.The 3rd parallel story is of the real lead character of the film, high school student Sam Witwicky (played by the engaging young actor Shia LaBeouf, who ironically comes off looking good given the crap dialogue he has to work with; he has such enthusiasm and energy that he draws you in to the story). Sam holds the key to everything as his great, great grandfather was an explorer, one of whose old keepsakes contains the information to the location of the cube. Sam's father buys him a car that turns out to be one of the Autobot transformers who leads Sam to the other Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. Sam also has an assist from his sexy girlfriend Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox). I found Sam and Mikaela's story to be the most entertaining, if that means anything. Eventually, all sides (military, government, Sam and his buddy Autobots) come together to try to save Earth.Unfortunately, the film has several boring and unnecessary scenes and waaaaay too many characters that distract rather than entertain (John Turturro in particular is annoying as a weird government agent that is part of a secret agency that knows something of the impending alien attack and Anthony Anderson just looks bad as 'the best hacker in the world'). Sam's parents are excruciatingly annoying as well, especially the mom who just plain never shuts up. Actually, virtually all of the minor characters are annoying, mostly due to wooden dialogue from a terrible script. Probably every scene in this film has lines that are supposed to be funny, and MAYBE 5%(if that) of the lines in this movie that are supposed to be funny are actually funny. Additionally, of the lines that are NOT supposed to be funny, about 99% of them are so cringe-inducingly bad that they make you go, 'Huh! Where'd the hell did that line come from!'. This unfortunately is why many big movies now are failures: too much focus on special effects and action and not enough on good scripts and characters. And even the action between the warring robots at the climax is not all that impressive. Oh, and the robots get some pretty bad lines, too. Even they couldn't come out of this mess unscathed.The film reminds me a lot of INDEPENDENCE DAY, a movie that I will forever despise. But actually, I prefer this film (barely) to ID, maybe b/c I find the leads LaBeouf and Fox both promising and engaging (I pretty much can't stand Will Smith and Bill Pullman was perhaps the WORST portrayal of a U.S. President in any film ever in that movie!) and I find the Transformers aliens to be more interesting than those whatever-the-hell-they-were aliens in ID. Also, I expected more of ID with its more accomplished, well-known cast; but in its own way, ID is much worse than this film, and that's saying something, b/c this 'film' is not good.",2,2,5,4 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Maybe I'm just sentimental
","I really must be missing something because I came out of the theatre on premiere night of STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) thinking I had just seen the best Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. But, hey, that's just me! LOL Believe me, I've been to movies where I've seen them in the theatre and known right away whether or not they are trash, and TLJ is not even close to that. The only part that underwhelmed me was that casino planet nonsense, but otherwise, I thought this film hit every right note start to finish. For one thing, I really liked how tight and focused the plot of this movie was. None of this jumping around from planet to planet. Just 3 or 4 major settings to centralize all the action. I also love how fluid this film was with 'The Force Awakens', picking up where it left off. You can actually watch TFA and TLJ as a 5-hour film and I'm not complaining about that!TLJ continues the Star Wars story picking up where TFA left off with our central heroine from the first film Rey (reprised excellently by Daisy Ridley) finding the legendary Jedi Master and original trilogy hero Luke Skywalker (brilliantly played by Mark Hamill in arguably a career performance), who is living as a hermit on a distant island planet in self-imposed exile due to his failure in training his nephew Ben Solo/Kylo Ren (superbly played again by Adam Driver), many years before Emperor Snoke (acted exquisitely by chameleon Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, the Resistance led by Princess Leia Organa (wonderfully played by Carrie Fisher in her last film role) fends off the First Order dreadnoughts with lead pilot Commander Poe Dameron (energetically reprised by Oscar Isaacs) as the remaining rebel flagships make their escape from the home base. The First Order is led again by General Hux (wonderfully played by Domhnall Gleeson in a scene-stealing performance). Additionally, rebel converter Finn (once again played with confident charm by John Boyega) awakes from his coma and joins forces with rebel soldier Rose (well played by newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to a local planet to retrieve a master codebreaker so they can infiltrate the First Order flagship to remove a tracking device they are using to locate the rebels. During Rey's training with Luke, several deep secrets are revealed that compels Rey to choose sides between Luke and Kylo.While TLJ is a very long movie, I was never bored due to great pacing and the strong acting and characters leaping off the screen. In particular, Hamill plain stole the show with his more world-weary, wise, and cranky version of the iconic Luke Skywalker. The Luke-Rey scenes were very similar to the Yoda-Luke training scenes from ESB. The island scenes were my very favorite set pieces with beautiful visuals, scenery and those cute Porg creatures. The battle scenes were invigorating and edge-of-your-seat. Also, it was great seeing the old faithful characters like Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and the new old faithful BB-8. As well as one that caught me completely by pleasant surprise. Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job carrying on the Star Wars saga in my opinion. Not sure why there have been such negative reaction to it. I enjoy these new movies almost as much as the originals. Looking forward to Episode 9!",9,0,3,18 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's best
","KILL BILL VOL1 is the crowning film in Quentin Tarantino's career. I almost hate to put the VOL1, because alone, this first film is a great accomplishment without having VOL2, although I can appreciate what part 2 was trying to do: add depth and character backstory to the plot. In VOL1, plot is unnecessary! I'll just refer to VOL1 as KILL BILL hereafter. The genius of KILL BILL is that you don't need plot or character development to appreciate its brilliance. It's not about these things. KILL BILL is purely stylistic, an homage to all those kick-ass-and-take-names martial arts grindhouse movies of the 70s with stars like Bruce Lee to led you through the carnage. What was the real substance or motivation in those movies? Not much substance and the motivation was revenge, just like in this one. And you don't need any backstory or extra dialogue (very little here) to know from the start that it is all about revenge.The person perpetrating the revenge, our protagonist, is The Bride (played to absolute stunning, convincing, athletic perfection by Uma Thurman). This is Thurman's greatest accomplishment as an actress. She had to be believable as a martial artist (she is), to show agility and athleticism (she does), and make us believe that she is a total, 100%, lethal, bad-ass, killing machine (she does all that in spades!). This role could NOT have been easy! Thurman should have been nominated for Best Actress.The Bride's singular goal is to eliminate those who have wronged her. The main perpetrator is 'Bill', who shoots this pregnant woman in the head before the film's credits even roll. (BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT!) The 'start' of the film is really the end of the film, when The Bride goes to a suburban home to see 'Jeannie Bell', aka Vernita Green (played wonderfully by Viveca Fox). We know Vernita is an old foe of The Bride's (we just don't know why, but there is a brief hint during this opening scene) b/c The Bride immediately attacks Vernita and they get into an all-out super-fight, complete with martial artistry, acrobatics, and knifeplay. It still is one of my favorite scenes in the film.Now, flashback 4 years and 6 months earlier to the time occurring right after the pre-credits scene. A group of Texas Rangers, led by Earl McGraw (played by the well cast veteran actor Michael Parks) are at the church where the shooting of The Bride and her wedding party took place. They soon realize that she's alive and she is hospitalized. During hospitalization, she is briefly visited by a mysterious woman named Elle (played by Darryl Hannah in her only scene in this film, but she leaves a lasting impression) who wants to kill her, but she is stopped by 'Bill' (who we only hear on the phone, but don't see).The Bride remains in coma for 4 years and upon learning that she has lost her baby, immediately wants revenge on the perpetrators, who are former colleagues of hers (including Elle and Vernita). Called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, we are introduced to a third member of the team name O'Ren Ishii (played by Lucy Liu) via a cartoon that backstory's her life. Ironically, this cartoon is the only set of scenes with real emotion and character development, and I'm sure this was Tarantino's intention. It totally works.The Bride travels to Okinawa, Japan to meet the world-famous swordsman/maker Hattori Hanzo (played by legendary martial arts actor Sonny Chiba in a beautiful performance). Hanzo, upon learning that The Bride is a wronged student of his former student Bill, who he now despises, agrees to make her his best sword so that she can exact her revenge. She travels to Tokyo to claim her first victim O'Ren.The Tokyo scenes, in a popular nightclub, are the climax of the film and these sequences are jaw-droppingly suspenseful and exciting to watch. It begins with a long, uncut, tracking shot of The Bride waiting for O'Ren and her lackeys, then it finally cuts to O'Ren and her crew having a jovial time until they hear The Bride call O'Ren out, and the fight (and fun) begins! The Bride has to battle not only O'Ren's posse, but also her fighting force The Crazy 88s. In between these 2 fights, she battles the teenaged, psychopathic, slick Gogo Yubari (played by Chiaki Yurikama in an impressive film debut). This scene is another fave of mine. Thurman and Yurikama really show some impressive weapons play and acrobatics in this scene. Then there's the scene with the Crazy 88s, an all-out, take-no-prisoners bloodfest where The Bride stands tall in the end. Tarantino outdid himself with this scene b/c I can't ever remember an action scene thrilling and exciting me this much. EVER! The Bride has her final battle with O'Ren. Lucy Liu is perfectly cast as O'Ren. Even though O'Ren is a young woman, she is very worldly and experienced b/c she was forced into it from a very young age, as we learned in the cartoon. This final battle scene is more elegant and classy (and much less bloody) than the earlier fight scenes. Just good old-fashioned swordplay.KILL BILL is my favorite work of Tarantino's b/c I never get tired of it, like I eventually did of PULP FICTION, which has a few clunky characters and scenes upon further viewing. Tarantino's frenetic 'love-of-movies' style really shines brightest in KILL BILL VOL. 1 with vignettes that separately are unique and memorable, but strung together form a singularly brilliant movie-watching experience. Tarantino's choice of music is also pitch perfect, with each scene having a different tune to match it's tone and mood. The diversity of music in the action-packed finale is an incredible integration of music in film! There's something to be said for 100% pure, unapologetic entertainment, and KILL BILL delivers! A must see for real MOVIE fans.",10,7,14,31 March 2008
Jerry Maguire," The REAL Best Picture of 1996!
","JERRY MAGUIRE is genius! Proof that with the right direction, writing, and acting, a film can be exceptional no matter how untested it's subject matter might be. Who'd have thought a film about a sports agent and his early mid-life crisis of conscience would be such a watchable, enjoyable flick? Not me! The anchor of this wondrous film is none other than Mr. Tom Cruise, who of course plays the title role. This is arguably the best work that Cruise has ever done. He makes you believe that he truly is this man who has had up to this point has lived a very fun, yet unfulfilling existence. The key to this crisis is that Jerry is himself unsure about what the future holds for him, but he takes the risk of going out there and regenerating himself and focusing not on what is profitable, but what is right. Rightfully so, Cruise was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy for this film, and flat out should have won! In retrospect, it shouldn't have even been a question.Cruise gets magnificent support from newcomer Renee Zellweger (who plays Dorothy Boyd and who should have been nominated for Supporting Actress), Bonnie Hunt (Dorothy's sister Laurel, who I wouldn't have minded getting a nom also!), and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who actually won Best Supporting Actor as Jerry's sole client NFL wide receiver Rod Tidwell). Special mention should go to Jonathan Lipnicki (as Dorothy's son Ray). Regina King is also wonderful as Rod's wife, Jay Mohr as Jerry's rival agent Bob Sugar, and Kelly Preston as Jerry's girlfriend early in the film.Dorothy worked at the big firm that Jerry was fired from after his crisis and leaves with him to start his own agency. A very uneasy and uncertain relationship forms and it seems more like a business partnership than anything. Then Jerry forms a special bond with Ray and he wants an instant family, even though it appears he is not in love with Dorothy. Jerry and Rod have an uneasy alliance also as Rod thinks Jerry is only interested in using him as a tool to jumpstart his new business and nothing else. In the end, the respective pairings form unbreakable bonds with each other. In particular, Jerry's revelation that he is in love with Dorothy, not just idea of stability and family, is memorable.The brilliance of JERRY MAGUIRE is that it dares to talk and discuss things that people take for granted all the time (dating, relationships, family, raising children, friendship). It treats all of this as the most serious of things. Characters actually question Jerry's motives and refuse to let him off the hook (and vice versa!). Dorothy and Rod see in Jerry things that no one else ever saw to, or cared to, see in him. In doing so, the payoff in the end makes you realize why it focused on all of this. Directed by the great Cameron Crowe (who also did SAY ANYTHING and ALMOST FAMOUS), JERRY MAGUIRE is one in a million!",10,1,4,19 June 2009
Mission: Impossible II," Inferior sequel
","John Woo has directed some good movies (FACE OFF, BROKEN ARROW), but MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 isn't one of them. MI2 is the stylistic opposite of the brilliant, underrated 'original' MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE (directed by the great Brian DePalma), which managed to maintain the claustrophobic tone and mood of the original MI 1960's TV series whilst updating it with all the modern techno gadgets and still be full throttle excitement. MI2 is a classic example of a sequel that doesn't live up to the original. Big surprise.Quite often in Hollywood, sequels are directed by completely different directors with mixed results (JAWS 2, DIE HARD 2, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, the post-Burton BATMAN movies, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK). OK, the last example (EMPIRE) is a film considered (by some) superior to its predecessor (STAR WARS), but c'mon! There's still a large contingent of folks that prefer the fun, no-holds-barred, in-your-face action of STAR WARS to the downbeat, serious tone of EMPIRE, myself included. MI and MI2 is a good example of this. While original MI (made in 1996) is pure entertainment and fast-paced fun, this movie MI2 is overlong, dull in many parts, and really a standard Hollywood action flick.The always-reliable Tom Cruise is sadly stuck in this tripe that continues the sage of our hero Ethan Hunt as he is on holiday mountain-climbing when new IMF chief (played by unbilled Anthony Hopkins, who is not in the film enough for me). A rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (played by a not-too-scary Dougray Scott), disguised as Hunt in one of those masks made famous in the original film, has stolen the antidote for the chimera virus from a doctor friend of Ethan's and plans to sell it on the black market, but first he must steal the virus itself to use it on a major population (Sydney, Australia to be exact, the primary setting of most of the film's action). The cure is no good without something to cure! That pretty much sums it up, except for a dull love story between Hunt and three-named master jewel thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (played by the beautiful Thandie Newton). I'm sorry, but sex and love stories ruin good action films and this one drags it down. The original kept things simple and the love story (such as it was) to a bare minimum; this one should have as well. There is all this sappy background music while we watch Hunt take down the bad guys near the end flashing between Hunt and Nyah dying from the disease that Ambrose has infected her with as part of his revenge (Nyah dumped Ambrose before she fell for Hunt). A love triangle in an MI action flick? Good times!*cough*BEING SARCASTIC*cough! When watching it, I was thinking of the total ripoff of Hitchcock's greatest films (secret agent gets party girl that he secretly loves to do the government's bidding by using sex, a la NOTORIOUS; but the most obvious ripoffs are from the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST: double agent female caught between 2 lovers, dangerous mountain scenes and chases, 2nd-in-command to the big bad guy with an unnatural, possibly-more-than-platonic connection to his boss and of course guarded of him and suspects the femme fatale is up to no good, etc., etc.Also the action itself is that standard slo-mo John Woo stuff. Slow-moving motorcycles, slow-moving fight scenes, slow-moving bullets. Boring, boring, boring. And when I watch a movie with really bad guys like these (infecting a major population with a deadly virus), I LOVE to hate their guts, but for some reason, I couldn't muster up barely an ounce of hatred for these guys. I guess they really didn't scare me all that much. Jon Voight was a much more scary, diabolical villain in MI; I as the viewer really enjoyed watching him get his in the end; when Scott got his here, I just didn't care. Pretty much sums up my feeling about MI2.",3,0,2,3 November 2008
Major League," My FAVORITE baseball movie!
","MAJOR LEAGUE (1989) might not be especially deep or provocative or ethereal like such more regarded classics as THE NATURAL, BULL DURHAM, EIGHT MEN OUT, or FIELD OF DREAMS (how did the 80s produce so many good baseball movies?!), but in retrospect, MAJOR LEAGUE is most probably my favorite among the bunch just b/c it is so plain entertaining! While those other films try to go for the long ball and swing for the fences, MAJOR LEAGUE basically just tries to make contact and get on base! And it does it with great humor, grit, and palpable appeal! The main reason MAJOR LEAGUE works is due to the casting, first and foremost the underrated Tom Berenger in one of his most accomplished film performances. Berenger totally carries ML as veteran, crafty, world-weary, womanizing catcher Jake Taylor, whose last chance at glory is upon him with a tryout with the Cleveland Indians, a franchise that hadn't been in a World Series since 1954. Berenger's laid-back, man's man appeal sets the tone of the film and everyone basically plays off of him. He's as effortless as the lead in ML as Kevin Costner was in his 80s baseball movies.The diverse supporting cast is sublime: Charlie Sheen as closer Ricky 'Wild Thing' Vaughn, Corbin Bernsen as egotistical, media-schmoozing 3rd baseman Roger Dorn, scene-stealing James Gammon as scruffy, take-no-prisoners manager Lou Brown, Wesley Snipes as slick 'Willie Mays' Hayes, Dennis Haysbert as voodoo-worshipping Pedro Cerrano, sexy Margaret Whitton as devious team owner Rachel Phelps (undercutting the team hoping it will lose so she can sell it for profit), enchanting Rene Russo as Jake's true love Lynn Wells, and last but not least Mr. Baseball Bob Uecker, used brilliantly in an all-too-welcome role as Indians announcer Harry Doyle.The strength of ML is that it has a real 'everyday' appeal that one doesn't find to often in movie comedies. It has a lot of (seemingly improvised) montage scenes of the team throughout the season and just random extras playing Indian fans in bars, at games, at work thrown in to give it a universal appeal; in this way, it allows the viewer to root for this underdog team along with them. But these scenes all feel REAL and the movie doesn't work without them.Everything in ML is relatable to the viewer. The laughter comes from the reality of the situation and is not manipulative at all. Of all the baseball movies I've ever seen, ML feels like the one that gets the sport of BASEBALL right!",10,0,1,28 September 2010
The Dark Knight," Really bad movie disguised (and not very well!) as a good one!
","THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! I've seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for it's running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP?At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although I'm a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isn't even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan?*Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordon's family, and that bad cop Ramirez! I'm sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasn't jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhall's Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHE'S NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesn't cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble!*Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and don't even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripe's sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business.*That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY cliché. I mean, it's barely even a DECENT movie!Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolan's hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didn't get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that he's THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Wayne's butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development.Tim Burton's surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burton's unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolan's films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I don't care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think!",1,17,34,15 December 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Exhilarating underdog film, with more than one underdog!
","THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED (TGGEP, 2005) is an amazingly uplifting, infectious underdog film that never (really) devolves into sappiness or heavyhandedness. Yes, it takes several liberties, as most Hollywood films do, but those liberties are forgiven as they actually add to the film's enjoyment, not detract from it. In fact, there are a lot of truthful moments in it. You can really tell that it's a 'Rocky' type film from the film's outset, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, right?!), it's expertly done and immensely watchable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, cockiness, and class by superstar-to-be Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from a working class Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s. Ouimet qualifies to play in the 1913 U.S. Open. Included amongst his competition is the legendary Harry Vardon (played with immense class, dignity, and ferocity by Stephen Dillane). Ironically, Vardon is the 2nd underdog in this flick! The film starts in 1870s Scotland where land developers tell the youngster that they are building a golf course on his home and that golf is a game not for the likes of someone like him. Francis undergoes some of the same prejudice as a boy in early 1900s Brookline. The stories converge at the 1913 Open.What's ironic is that even as an adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still an outcast in British society due to his upbringing. Francis learned much about golf from reading Vardon's books on the subject and Vardon is his idol all growing up. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they actually met back in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won that year's Open, was touring when Francis was only 7.In addition to Francis and Vardon, entrants in the 1913 Open include Vardon's friend and champion Brit Ted Ray (boisterous Stephen Marcus) and classless, chest-thumping two-time defending champion John McDermott (Michael Weaver). The film really does a good job of showing the different personalities of these men.Redheaded Marnie McPhail is ingratiatingly serene and stunning as Francis' supportive Irish mum and veteran Elias Koteas gives a stern, reserved, taciturn performance as his French dad. Addtionally, plucky young Josh Flitter (as Francis' pint-sized 10-year old caddy Eddie) almost single handedly steals the proceedings.Paxton throws in a lot of modern details, such as special effects zooming-in shots to show the scoreboard positioning of the players and CGI for a lot of the golf shots to keep the film exciting and at a brisk pace so as not to make the film too much of a period piece. But the film still convinces us of a specific time and place.What's interesting is that, while Rocky-like, this is all based on a true story! So the ending is satisfactory on so many levels. An entertaining film about golf set in the early 1900s...Wow!",9,0,1,23 January 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter gets dark!
","HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) is really, IMHO, the first Harry Potter film to be purely dark in overall tone and mood. There is a sense of doom, sadness, and dread that permeates throughout that is not really completely present in the earlier films. ORDER is actually the 2nd Harry Potter film that I saw when it first came out (GOBLET OF FIRE being the 1st), then I went back and watched the first 3 (SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZKABAN) on DVD. All films before ORDER definitely had lighthearted moments of fun and whimsy. ORDER does not and I think that's a good thing! In that sense, I'd say that ORDER is the first 'mature' Harry Potter film.ORDER gets off to a great start with Harry (once again played superbly by Daniel Radcliffe, but this time with an added touch of maturity) sitting alone on a swing, having spent the summer re-living the tragic events at the end of GOBLET to Cedric Diggory (played by TWILIGHT's Robert Pattinson, who has a very brief cameo in this one). Voldemort killed Diggory at the end of Goblet, but only Harry saw it. His bullying cousin Dudley (funny Harry Melling) shows up with his entourage to make fun of Harry when the Dementors show up and Harry must use his wizardry powers in Muggle world, which violates Hogwarts rules. The Ministry of Magic wants to expel Harry, but Prof. Dumbledore (again essayed expertly by Michael Gambon, who has made the role his own more and more in each new film) intervenes saying that he believes Harry's story about both Voldemort and the Dementors, so Harry is allowed back in Hogwarts.Harry meets up with the the Weasleys, their son and his best friend Ron (again played solidly by Rupert Grint) and best friend Hermione (again played by the charming Emma Watson), his godfather Sirius Black (reprised by the great Gary Oldman) and others who call themselves the 'Order of the Phoenix' gathered together to fight Voldemort and his evil army of wizards.Upon arrival back at Hogwarts, Harry is shunned and scorned by his fellow students who don't believe him when he says that Voldemort has returned. Feeling lonely, sad, and betrayed, he pushes away Hermione and Ron (who both are a bit skeptical themselves) and he meets one Luna Lovegood (played brilliantly by the perfectly cast Evanna Lynch), a rather strange Hogwarts student with special abilities to see creatures (an ability that Harry also possesses). They bond and Luna helps Harry to realize his importance and he is able to re-connect with his Hogwarts' friends. They band together to form their own wizard order to fight the impending doom that is Voldemort, who has in the mean time kidnapped Sirius. While training the new order, Harry grows closer to his long time Hogwarts crush Cho Chang (played the sweet Katie Leung).The wicked new Dark Arts instructor Dolores Umbridge (wonderfully and refreshingly played by Imelda Staunton) has had Dumbledore administratively removed (temporarily) by the Ministry as head of Hogwarts because of the secret goings on at the school and Harry et al work together to correct this. The new order, led by Harry go off to try and save Sirius in the climax from Voldemort (played with evil panache by Ralph Fiennes) and a group of Azkaban escapees led by Bellatrix LeStrange (played with sexy, vicious glee by Helena Bonham Carter).The main draw to ORDER for me is the rise in maturity and darkness that the prior films didn't quite focus on. It was understandable as they were much younger and those were more 'kids' films, although CHAMBER and AZKABAN have draws for adult audiences as well, especially AZKABAN. I think GOBLET is the weakest of all the films as it was much too focused on teen angst and raging hormones. Also, I think that ORDER did a great job introducing an eclectic group of new characters to the Harry Potter world like Luna, Bellatrix, and Umbridge. The start of dark Harry Potter...Great!",9,1,2,16 July 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," The greatest film of all time!
","Is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY about anything? Is it about nothing? Is it about everything? This is the joy of this masterpiece. Who knows? Who cares? It has no real plot, no real storyline to follow, no characters to get into (save for one that I will mention later). Personally, I think it's about man's miniscule existence in a completely awesome, unknown universe. The fact is: we DON'T know what is out there and probably never will. This is what makes this film the best sci-fi experience in all of history. It captures the essence of space travel as it really is w/o ever being a boring film to watch. The ambiguous ending only adds to the allure of the film and makes one ponder, wonder, and dream. Tracking man's journey from its evolutionary origins and fast-forwarding to the year 2001 in the age of space travel and moon landings, the film is a testament to man's capacity to think, absorb, learn, understand (or at least try to) and explore a vast and ever-changing universe.As stated, the film starts millions of years ago to the time when apes were learning how to hunt, kill, eat, and seek shelter to survive the vast earth, then jump-cuts (perhaps the most famous cut in all of film history) to the year 2001 and man roaming the universe in search of other life forms. This cut on the surface is about the evolution of man, but it is symbolic of how the humans of the future still were still learning and exploring just like the apes of the past. Evolution never stops.The 2001 humans find a mysterious monolith buried on the moon during an excavation (the apes of the past also encountered a similar monolith). They send a group of astronauts on a fact-finding mission to Jupiter to learn of its origins and what it all means. The astronauts are led by Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The Jupiter spaceship is controlled by an advanced, thinking, supercomputer with the acronym HAL-9000, and HAL-9000 is that 'character' that I mentioned before. HAL (a machine!) is the only character that we can relate to. HAL is supersmart, but very self-serving and diabolical, as a malfunctioning system threatens its very existence. So HAL schemes and plots against his astronaut companions to sabotage the mission. These sequences are among the most memorable in film history as the astronauts must outsmart HAL in order to survive and complete the mission.Bowman does survive and journeys through some kind of a black hole or wormhole to seemingly another vast part of the galaxy. This sequence still fascinates to this day. During travel, Bowman mysteriously ages quickly and then is actually re-born and the cycle starts over for him. Ambiguity has never been so fascinating! I just think that 2001 is the greatest film ever b/c of the fact that it doesn't have characters to love or hate and is about something more than just what most movies are about. The film never disappoints, as even the most acclaimed movies sometimes do.",10,1,3,15 April 2008
Grindhouse," Filmmakers, especially Tarantino, go off the deep end!
","I loved Robert Rodriguez's 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' and a COUPLE of Quentin Tarantino's films that paid homage to genres/films while transcending them by being great films in their own right. But Tarantino started losing it some time around 'Kill Bill Volume 2', while Rodriguez never quite received the overall acclaim and popularity that Tarantino enjoys. This offering, GRINDHOUSE, is a two-feature presentation with various trailers sprinkled in to parody and pay homage to several B-movie genres: zombie, sexploitation, blaxploitation, alien invasion, and chick flick movies. I find both features to be lacking for different reasons.The first one is Rodriguez' PLANET TERROR, which moves at a breakneck pace and doesn't let up. Set in Austin TX, it starts out with hot brunette Rose McGowan playing stripper Cherry Darling, who quits her job and gets run off the road by a bunch of military goons, led by Bruce Willis. Here's one of my problems: I think Tarantino goes overboard using certain actors in his flicks repeatedly and Willis in PLANET TERROR is an example. Willis doesn't really add anything special here. But Tarantino's role is even worse! Does he really have to be in this? Tarantino's PLANET TERROR role is a contender for the WORST character in both GRINDHOUSE movies and that is scary considering how bad many of the characters are in both! He doesn't work here for me and neither does Michael Parks again playing Earl McGraw from KILL BILL VOL1. So now Rodriguez has to 'borrow' a character from the Tarantino film universe to populate his cast? Willis and his military squad are bartering a trade with some scientist (Naveen Andrews) for a chemical compound that turns humans in to zombies. In trying to double-deal, the two parties battle, the compound is released, creating a town of zombies. Then its up to Cherry and El Wray (a deadpan Freddie Rodriguez, who, along with McGowan, delivers the only two decent performances in this film!) to lead the unexposed inhabitants to safety. These include the Sheriff (Michael Biehn of ALIENS and TOMBSTONE), Bone Shack owner J.T. (Jeff Fahey of WHITE HUNTER BLACK HEART), and Dr. Dakota Block (a very bland Marley Shelton, the second female lead). Josh Brolin, as Shelton's jealous husband and fellow Sawbones Dr. Block, reminded me too much of a younger, surlier version of Nick Nolte with dark hair and his character was just too nasty and disgusting, and this is BEFORE he became a zombie! Actually, PLANET TERROR is too disgusting too digest (pardon the oxymoron!). I've read quite a few reviews calling PLANET TERROR one of the best zombies movies ever...Really?! Don't know what film these people were watching! Just seemed like tedious re-tread that in no way, shape, or form really improves on what it parodies. It was TOO disgusting (the zombie look was too slimy and sickening!) and the characters all seemed to be sleepwalking through a rather thin script. I KNOW it's supposed to be a parody, but the dialogue was not funny at all and many of the characters were just kind of...there. As I said, McGowan and Rodriguez seemed up to the task if only they were given better material and better support to work with! Too bad, really.DEATH PROOF has a lot more exposition and character detail, but it is overkill (pardon the pun!). Contrary to popular belief, the dialogue in Tarantino's best works (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Volume 1) had meaning and revealed things about the characters and went somewhere! The dialogue in his weaker efforts, including this one, DEATH PROOF, do not. It's just a bunch of girls talking about nothing. DEATH PROOF is about a serial killer Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell in the only good performance in this film). Actually in the early bar scene in the first act, I dare say that Russell's acting is exceptional! Wish the film had stayed the course with this act. Stuntman Mike kills young girls with his 'death proof' stunt car. Russell, like the stars McGowan and Rodriguez of PLANET TERROR, sadly, cannot overcome bad material and a weak supporting cast overall. Actually, McGowan plays a supporting role in this flick and I liked her most of all the main females in DEATH PROOF and she had the least dialogue and screen time! Too bad her talent was wasted in these two films! DEATH PROOF contains two sets of girls and ALL of them were unsexy and cringe-inducingly boring to listen to and most of them I found to not be attractive! Correct me if I'm wrong, but being an exploitation chick flick, aren't the 'chicks' supposed to be hot?! NONE of the girls in either set is that! The first set of girls (Jordan Ladd, Vanessa Ferlito, Sydney Tamii Poitier) are a bunch of hip-wannabes: joint-smoking, liquor-guzzling, flip-flop-wearing twenty-something whores (frankly, that ain't sexy!). The second set (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms, Zoe Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead), 'Hollywood' types, are a group of non-descript, trash-talking bitties with sorry bodies! This second set was NOT attractive at all...NOT a single one! At least the first group were appealing to look at, if annoying as hell! One thing that ALWAYS attracted me to B-flicks of this sort is when they had hot women. I guess there aren't enough of them in today's world to qualify! Next time, get it right Quentin!Overall, GRINDHOUSE winds up being self-indulgent fare. I'd say that Rodriguez effort is mildly entertaining and he did a better job of parodying his source material, but PLANET TERROR is too disgusting (and rather bland) for it's own good. Tarantino may just be on the cusp of going off the deep end though! Although I haven't like all his films, I never thought he was 100% self-indulgent. DEATH PROOF has changed my mind on that one! Yikes!",2,0,1,7 September 2009
Mission: Impossible," Highly enjoyable spy flick!
","Brian DePalma's modern remake of the 1960s MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TV series is highly enjoyable. I find myself re-watching it a lot mainly due to the great set pieces contained throughout the film. A major part of its appeal is the movie-set style cinematography. It doesn't feel like 'location shooting'. There's a real old Hollywood appeal to the film. It keeps the focus on the characters and situation at hand and gives the film a personal feel. There isn't all this expansive, showy cinematography and crazy effects like in the sequels. It's like the film itself is a multi-act play done on a sound stage or in a studio, kind of a modern day version of those great 30s and 40s films set in foreign places. Yet it still has an appealing modern sensibility.The plot is amazingly simple: a rogue CIA agent plans to steal and sell the non-official cover (NOC) list to the highest bidder on the international market and a team of IMF agents is assigned to stop the transaction. The team is led by Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) and includes Phelps' wife Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), Sarah Davies (Kristin Scott Thomas), Hannah Williams (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), Jack Harmon (an uncredited Emilio Estevez), and the final member of our team Ethan Hunt(played by the film's star, the versatile Tom Cruise).This is definitely one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies. I always forget about this film in Cruise's arsenal, maybe b/c it's just so enjoyable of a film experience to me and so I forget that I am watching Tom Cruise and just get totally into the film itself. Cruise is truly effortless in his portrayal of Ethan Hunt. He had never really done an action film before this and he is completely believable.Every member of the team (except Ethan) is killed during the mission. The operation was really a mole hunt to weed out the real traitor, so Ethan is suspect #1 in the eyes of the CIA. The rest of the film is Ethan trying to clear his name, so he puts together his own team to find the real culprit. The new team includes Claire (who turns out survived the initial mission), Franz Krieger (Jean Reno), and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). This leads to the best scene of the film: the hacking of the CIA central computer where Hunt has to enter through the ceiling upside down suspended on a tightrope mechanism. I never tire of this suspenseful scene. A DePalma keeper!DePalma directed MISSION IMPOSSIBLE with is usual style of suspenseful, tense, well-laid out scenes, like the CIA break-in where there is the continuous tracking shot of the team going their separate ways to do their various tasks. The film is essentially a series of entertaining, tongue-in-cheek set pieces with tense character interactions as it is hard to know who Ethan can trust in his quest for the truth and THREE memorable set pieces: (1) the early Aquarium restaurant scene in Prague, the (2) aforementioned CIA break-in, and (3) the climactic speeding train scene from London to Paris. I also like the minor tweaks to the MI theme from the 60s series, updated to fit a modern Hollywood film. The plot really plays second fiddle to the action and intrigue, though.",10,3,5,28 July 2008
Saw," The 21st century's first great horror film!
","SAW is a film that can be considered a fusion of many elements of the horror genre. It has the deranged 'killer' who methodically downs his victims (like PSYCHO and all the subsequent slasher films that tried to emulate it). In that sense, he is just a mindless killer like Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, or Michael Myers. In reality, he is an intelligent serial killing sociopath with deep-rooted hatred of people who take life for granted: those are his victims, so that he is much more like the killer in SEVEN and other films about serial killers who are always one step ahead of the cops and FBI (in this case, he's about 5 steps ahead at all times!). Also, it is a very stylish film with a real grade-A Hollywood look and feel, but still captures the atmosphere of a horror film.SAW is told in a random fashion with a lot of flashback scenes that drive the film. Although the PULP FICTION scenes technically weren't flashbacks, the style of SAW reminded me a great deal of that film, like each scene was its own separate vignette. You actually learned a lot about the different characters in these scenes. Case in point: the brilliant early sequence where the cops find one of the killer's victims in a dark cellar and as they discuss and re-create the crime, we see in flashback how the killer (unseen to the viewer) terrorizes the victim and shows us how he met his fate. Just one of the many great scenes of the film.Cut to the first scene of our 'heroes': Dr. Lawrence Gordon (played with cool precision by Cary Elwes) and Adam (impressive performance by newcomer Leigh Wannell, who also developed the story and wrote the screenplay), who find themselves trapped in some grungy, dirty old warehouse bathroom chained to the fixtures. They find they cannot free themselves by any means. There is a man in the middle of the floor, a previous victim of our killer, who apparently shot himself when he realized that a slow-acting poison was coursing through his veins.Gordon knows who is behind this: a killer who calls himself Jigsaw. In flashback, Gordon tells Adam how Jigsaw kidnaps, imprisons, and traps his victims and then forces them to make life-or-death decisions to release themselves from their traps. Sometimes they have to actually torture themselves or others to release themselves from the traps.In flashback, we find out that the cops suspected Gordon at first because they found something that belonged to Gordon at one of the crime scenes. The lead cop is Det. David Tapp (played solidly by veteran actor Danny Glover), who is essentially the other main character of the film. Tapp and his partner Det. Sing take Gordon to the station and question him and find out he is not the killer because of a solid alibi, then they have him look in on an interrogation of one of Jigsaw's victims who survived. The girl's name is Amanda (played brilliantly by Shawnee Smith, who has too little screen time) and her sequence is the best in the film and truly shows the depths of torture that Jigsaw puts his victims through. Michael Emerson is also exceptional as Zep, a rather odd orderly at Dr. Gordon's hospital.We also find out in flashback how Adam got there and of the connection between these 2 trapped men. We also get to learn about Gordon's family and personal life and why Jigsaw is punishing these 2 men. But most importantly, we learn about all of Jigsaw's earlier victims and the elaborate traps that he has put them in and what they must do in order to survive.The film speaks a lot as to what depths a human will go to in order to save his life when he is pushed to the breaking point. Jigsaw has obviously planned his traps very carefully. The film has a major surprise ending, one of the biggest surprises that I have seen in a film ever. I was totally shocked by it.SAW is a highly original, high-concept film. It could have failed miserably, but succeeds in spades! It has a wealth of interesting characters, a highly stylized look, a labyrinthine enjoyable plot, a pulse-pounding score, and an original serial killer for the new generation. A must see!",10,0,1,3 July 2008
Total Recall," Fun-filled Verhoeven-Schwarzenegger pairing!
","I've always been a HUGE Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, because in his prime in the 80s and early 90s, he made hugely profitable and entertaining movies. TOTAL RECALL (1990) is Arnie at his action (and perhaps even acting) peak. Total Recall may be the first movie of Schwarzenegger's that I realized, 'Darn! This guy ain't a bad actor!'. For you guys that think that Schwarzenegger can't act, watch this film. Actually, given the director, the great Paul Verhoeven, I should not have expected any less. He does an amazing job of taking larger-than-life beings, like Murphy in Robocop, and the superhuman Schwarzenegger in this film, and humanizing for all of us common folk. We actually relate to these powerful, yet sensitive, skewed, and damaged beings.Set sometime in the 'future',Total Recall tells the tale of Douglas Quaid (the aforementioned Schwarzenegger in a totally convincing performance). Quaid has a hot wife (Sharon Stone in her trademark super-sexy, conniving, backstabbing vixen role that she would become famous for in pretty much all her later films) and a seemingly content existence. But he has dreams of another life on Mars with an alluring brunette (will talk about her later). The bored Quaid wants some excitement in his life and so he goes to the company Rekall where they implant memories and visions of a completely different personality and existence. Quaid requests to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend, a la James Bond. During implantation, something goes terribly wrong and it appears that Quaid already has implants that the Rekall procedure has messed with. Turns out that Quaid has been to Mars and is a secret agent named Hauser put on Earth for a special mission, or so we think.When I first saw the film, I couldn't distinguish whether or not the stuff happening at Rekall was truly happening or were part of their implants to Quaid b/c he DID request to be a secret agent on Mars with a sexy girlfriend. Ironic that he already had all that! That's part of the fun of the film: it keeps you guessing. And along the way, you get treated the classic Arnold puns and one-liners (got to have those). But in this film, Arnold actually shows some acting chops while he's delivering those pun-liners! He's really good.The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast: the aforementioned Stone, Ronny Cox (from Verhoeven's prior masterpiece Robocop), Michael Ironside as his #1 henchman (Ironside was also in Verhoeven's later Starship Troopers), and someone I've mentioned several times in this review, Rachel Ticotin as the dark-haired sexy girlfriend Melina, the one Quaid dreams about and requests at Rekall. Ticotin may just be the first (and last) Schwarzenegger female co-star that was his equal in terms of toughness and resourcefulness. Alluring is the word I used to describe her and that's what she is in this film: sexy without being overtly sexual, moderately attractive but still very desirable. It's easy to see what Quaid sees in her: she represents the excitement and danger that his humdrum daily existence lacks.Being a 'futuristic' film that came out in 1990, the film just barely escapes the dated look of 80s futuristic films. The look and feel of the film is believable enough to make you believe its the future, although some of the set pieces are a little humorous to take seriously now (the Johnny car?). But, all that aside, Total Recall is a great, thought-provoking action film with a complex premise and an all-time hero that everyone can root for: Arnold Schwarzenegger!",10,0,5,5 July 2008
Hoosiers," A winner anyway you look at it
","What's the best sports film of all time, you ask? Well, it's debatable, but I'd rank HOOSIERS high up there. Coming out in 1986 (the dated decade!), HOOSIERS still holds up remarkably well thanks to really great cinematography and set design. It really looks and feels like 1950s Indiana, even today. Without overdoing the period piece aspect and focusing on small town life and hometown values, HOOSIERS is a top-notch movie. In particular, the film is incredibly fast-paced.All credit goes to the great Gene Hackman, who plays dejected, displaced, and disgraced Coach Norman Dale from a big-time college program, who must take a downgraded high school coaching position as head coach at Hickory High School, the Huskers. Hackman exudes credibility as a no-nonsense, firm, yet sensitive man at the crossroads of his coaching career and his life. This actor could do it all by just being himself! Coach Dale arrives in the small town of Hickory, Indiana circa 1951 and immediately faces disdain and uncertainty upon his arrival. The small towners see him as a big-city guy who looks down on them and won't fit in. The locals question his coaching tactics and even challenge his authority directly at times. But Dale sticks to his guns and instills discipline and toughness into the promising basketball team. In particular, Dale shows particular interest in Jimmy Chitwood, a pure shooting guard who at first is not on the team, but then decides to re-join them on the condition that Coach Dale stays.Dale also has an initially rocky relationship with local Myra Fleener (well played by Barbara Hershey), who isn't very crazy about basketball and thinks education is more important. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dennis Hopper plays town drunk Shooter, whose son is on the team. Hopper almost steals the show, but I still think this film belongs completely to Hackman, especially with 20+ years of hindsight.Special mention should also go to the young men who played the Hickory Huskers. Really a band of unknowns who I don't think any have become famous since this film, the fact that real teens (and basketball players) played these characters helps make HOOSIERS all the more authentic.Of course, you have the obligatory happy ending, but it all fits into this gem of a sports film. Really, it doesn't get much better than HOOSIERS!",10,4,4,1 June 2009
Jack Reacher," Surprisingly entertaining, provocative film!
","My instincts told me to completely ignore this movie! I was sure that JACK REACHER (2012) would be a dud. Not so much because it starred Tom Cruise (I actually like him, see my reviews of his movies, most of which are very positive), but just I thought the title itself was misleading, making me think this was going to be some insipid, mindless summer action movie with corny one-liners. Nothing of the sort here! The film starts off with a literal bang, as a mystery sniper kills 5 innocent people in a square in downtown Pittsburgh (the film's setting and actual shooting location). The police immediately connect the dots and arrest a prime suspect named Barr (Joseph Sikora), a disturbed military veteran suffering from PTSD. All evidence points to him committing the crime, so the police detective in charge of the investigation Emerson (David Oyelowo) and the district attorney (film veteran Richard Jenkins) try to coax a confession out of him. Barr's only response is to write on the confession 'Get Jack Reacher'! The 2 men brainstorm to try and find him, but he finds them.Into town struts the film's title character, exquisitely brought to life by Tom Cruise. It's amazing that after such a variety and eclectic collection of roles in his now 30-year career that Cruise can so effortlessly essay a character like this, different from any other he's played before. I was certain that Reacher would be the typical Cruise cocky, smarmy character that he would do in roughly every other movie in the 80s and 90s, just an older version! But I was wrong. Now while Reacher is certainly a smooth operator and tough guy, Cruise also imbibes the character with great subtlety, intelligence, and class. Scenes that I expected to be totally cliché were presented in a very unique and interesting perspective due to clever dialog and nifty fight choreography. Not to mention there were really good actors in the supporting roles that gave their characters enough dimension so they didn't come across as the typical throwaway summer action movie boobs. In particular, I'd say my favorite supporting character was Sandy (expertly played by Alexia Fast), who had a couple of great scenes with Reacher that helped give the film it's heart. Rosamund Pike had a huge role in this movie as well. In fact, she actually may have had equal (and dare I say more?) screen time as Cruise. She played attorney Helen Rodin, who is defending Barr, but thinks he is guilty, so she is trying to get his sentence reduced from death penalty to life in prison. I found the dynamic between Cruise and Pike to be very refreshing. Although there were hints of sexual attraction, it was mostly downplayed to keep their relationship on a purely professional level. I was sure they'd be jumping each others' bones at some point in the proceedings! Additionally, the legendary Robert Duvall has a welcome extended cameo role and he of course makes the most of it. While the film has all the requisite elements of a summer action movie, it is surprisingly fresh in a lot of ways and turns the typical clichés found in summer movies on their heads with clever, convincing dialog, an involving storyline, and one of the all-time greats Tom Cruise carrying the show!",9,3,5,7 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Satisfying start to the series!
","Harry Potter is here to stay! Almost down to the last couple films, the Harry Potter series may end up being the most successful franchise in film history...not Star Wars, not LOTR, not Indiana Jones, not Batman, not even James Bond...but Harry Potter! And this film, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (2001), is the one that started it all! Really a super-cute kid's fantasy film while the future ones went darker and deeper, I still find this first one very enjoyable and watchable.As kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (Harry, Ron, Hermione, respectively) were infectiously adorable! There's an utter innocence in them in this first entry that hearkens one back to when things were simple. Thankfully, they have some major adults to back them up! Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, and especially Alan Rickman! Sadly, Mr. Harris is no longer with us (he was in the 2nd one CHAMBER OF SECRETS thankfully), but the rest have continued on throughout the series to keep it faithful and strong!SORCERER'S STONE, while not especially deep, does have some wonderful set pieces: the Hogwarts train ride, the exciting Quidditch match (Harry's first!) and the climactic Wizard's chess scene! But mainly, the directer Christopher Columbus does an admirable job introducing the viewer to this magical world without it ever devolving into insipid sappiness. This first film makes one 'believe', and that is a good start indeed!",8,0,1,13 October 2009
The Untouchables," One of the best films of the 1980s
","I have high regard for THE UNTOUCHABLES. It is as enjoyable and watchable even today as it was 20+ years ago. I say that either this or ROBOCOP is the best film of 1987. I wish the Oscar would go to the most rousing, enjoyable film of the year (like this one) rather than overlong epics (ironically, this film has an epic feel to it, but it is so fast-paced that it doesn't feel like a long film) or gimmicky, schmaltzy films. It received 4 Academy Award nominations in technical categories (Costume, Art Design, Original Score, and won for Best Supporting Actor Sean Connery). It should have won in the other 3 categories too, esp. the score one (one of the best I've ever heard!).Kevin Costner is perfection and a revelation as crime-fighting G-man Eliot Ness, sent to Prohibition-era Chicago to take down legendary gangster Al Capone. Costner became a huge star with this film and exudes that old, stalwart movie star quality without seeming stale and monotonous. For me, this is a highly underrated performance. Rather than play it macho and act like a tough guy, Costner plays it close to the vest and more real. To him, Ness is a human being trying to do the right thing, but he also has a family (wife, daughter, and expecting another child) and wants to go home to them every night! Al Capone is portrayed by the great Robert DeNiro (who gained 30 pounds to play this role) and essentially is a glorified cameo role that Mr. DeNiro (obviously!) makes the most of, showing that the truly great actors can do a lot with very little to work with. At first out of is league and seen as a joke, Ness quickly gets smart and tough by enlisting the aid of aging, world-weary Irish beat cop John Malone (played by the aforementioned Oscar-winning Connery, in his greatest film performance). Ness and Malone enlist a couple of other 'Untouchables' in Ness' fellow G-man accountant Wallace (the funny and quirky Charles Martin Smith) and rookie cop Stone (Andy Garcia in extremely solid work). The perfectly cast and executed film has some of the greatest set pieces ever in the history of film (1) the Untouchables and Canadian mounties' charge against Capone's men at the US/Canadian border, as well as Hitchcockian-style sequences (2) a long, uncut tracking shot in the halls of the police dept. hallway after Ness' men have supposedly nabbed the guy that can finger Capone, (3) Capone's goons going after Malone in his apartment, (4) Ness' confrontation with Frank Nitti at the courthouse, and finally (5) the great sequence at the train station of Ness and his men fighting Capone's men's to nab the accountant who can put the nail in Capone's coffin. Directed by the legendary Brian DePalma, I say this is his greatest achievement as a director. The Untouchables is a highly entertaining movie experience that reminds you of how much fun movies can really be! Superb!",10,0,3,6 March 2008
Mystic River," Mystic River, oh how I hate thee...let me count the ways!
","MYSTIC RIVER (2003) is a prime example of NAMES counting for something at the Oscars. Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney. All big names. How could a film with this star-power behind it possibly NOT get the acclaim it received? For some reason, the Academy loves the 'new' Eastwood, the one that some time around 2000 started making these overly dramatic, sappy, preachy morality plays that Oscar voters seem to suck up in droves! Honestly, and no understatement, I think that this film is the WORST thing that Eastwood has ever done! Yep, you heard me.Eastwood's EARLY-directed stuff was much more watchable, accessible, and relatable than any of the mess he's been churning out in the 00s. Give me 'High Plains Drifter', 'The Gauntlet', 'White Hunter Black Heart', 'Tightrope', and 'A Perfect World', all much more involving, interesting and gripping Eastwood-directed movies before he became an Oscar-begger! Heck, much as I think it's overrated, 'Unforgiven' is way above this Mystic River tripe! At least it's a fairly entertaining modern-day Western with at least a few strong performances and real meaning behind it, if it does kind of preach a bit too much and possess too many boring characters. Even in 'Unforgiven', none of the characters, even the villainous and shady characters, are hate-able. They are actually made relatable to the viewer.In Mystic River, there is nary a single likable character! They all seem so full of hate and disdain that I just can't find myself connecting with any of them. Penn plays ex-and-maybe-still-sometimes gangster Jimmy Markum, whose daughter Katie (played by Emmy Rossum) was recently murdered. Called in to investigate the case is Bacon, who plays Jimmy's childhood friend Sean Devine, a detective with the Boston PD. The prime suspect is Dave Boyle (played by Best Supporting Actor winner Tim Robbins), the 3rd in the triangle of friends. As a child, Dave was snatched by a pedophile and abused for days before eventually being saved, but of course this experience scars him for life.The main thing I don't get is, based on how the adult Dave is, I don't see how it is conceivable that he could even function in society. He has a wife Celeste (played by Best Supporting Actress nominee Harden) and young son, but the way he acts makes it seems like he's been literally screwed up his entire life. When did he ever get to a mental state where he could interact, date, get married, and raise a family? This part seems implausible to me. He seems to be in an eternal state of despair and depression with a wife who seems to be amped up and wired all the time! How did these 2 unstable people even raise their kid up to the point that they did? Robbins and Harden play the roles way too over-the-top.We are supposed to sympathize with Penn's Jimmy, but I find this man absolutely despicable. He is supposedly 'stable' with a successful local business, an almost-grown daughter (Rossum) from a previous marriage, his second wife Annabeth (played by Laura Linney) and their 2 young daughters. But Jimmy has an air of pomposity and vanity that is hard to get past. When his daughter is brutally murdered, of course he first suspects Dave, as both Jimmy and Sean had a part in Dave's abuse as they stood by while the stranger snatched him when they could have done something, so he thinks this may be Dave's revenge, which raises a whole new set of questions, most of which being, why wait so long to exact revenge?! Then Jimmy, not even knowing if Dave is truly guilty, just goes on the word of Celeste, who actually comes across as more unstable than Dave! Jimmy's reaction to his daughter's demise in the park is Oscar-begging-over-emoting at it's finest by Penn, and it worked, as he won Best Actor...yikes! AND, to top it all off, after Jimmy and his cousin-goons (wrongly) kill Dave, Jimmy's wife Annabeth actually calls him a 'hero'! Can't believe the viewer is supposed to sympathize with this loser of a character.While Jimmy lacks a soul, at least Sean seems distraught and to have a conscience about it all. Lost in Penn and Robbins' theatrics is that Bacon, as Sean, actually manages to deliver a reliably accessible and believable performance. Just goes to show that it's the showy, over-the-top stuff that generally impresses Oscar voters, not the more subtle, harder-to-pull-off work. Truly, at the end of this piece, I despised Penn's character SO much that I wanted Bacon's character to snuff him out...seriously!To top all of this nonsense off, the real reason that the girl was murdered is utterly ridiculous. I almost think this film would have worked better if it were not a murder mystery, but an actual treatise on child abuse and it's long-term after-effects. Instead, we get this over-acted snoozefest. Eastwood got a Best Director nom (didn't win, thank goodness!), but what did he exactly direct? This seems more like a star vehicle, an example of when directing almost doesn't matter. Close-up after close-up, cloying music, constant preaching and monologue-ing. Terrible film.",1,4,8,2 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The best Harry Potter film?
","Not originally a fan of this series (really, not interested), I've got to say that I now see the widespread appeal of these Harry Potter movies! I actually first saw GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) when it premiered on cable the year after it's release and liked it enough to want to start watching this series. Then when ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) came out 2 years later, I liked it, but it seemed to get really dark and serious more so than GoF and I really needed perspective in understanding the trajectory of these HP films. I went out and bought the 5-disc collection of SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZBAKAN, GOBLET OF FIRE, and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. It's apparent these films are purposefully getting darker as they move along, some staying very true to the source material, some taking liberties.Of the 5-disc set, I actually think this film, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, may be the best! I still like the other 4 for different reasons, but here's some reasons why I rate this one so high: *Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, improved immensely from the first film to this one! In SS, you could really tell the 12-year old youngster was a bit nervous and awestruck at having to carry the load of this franchise on his shoulders! Radcliffe, while adorably cute along with his co-stars Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) in SS, really needed to step it up in CoS and he did in spades! In CoS, 13-year old Radcliffe obviously established that he IS Harry Potter! *The film's length is not a bother! When a film this long (over 2 1/2 hours?) can sustain itself and hold your attention without ever devolving into boredom or tedium, that is saying something! Especially when it's led by 3 kids! Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deserve all praise! *Kenneth Branagh's delightfully fun performance as new Defense Against the Dark Arts Prof. Gilderoy Lockhart! This is the role that gets changed from film to film and Branagh's Lockhart is probably the best! *Christian Coulson as 16-year old Tom Riddle! This young actor was my favorite villain in all the films, even over Voldemort!...Uh, don't worry, I know what the big surprise was at the climax! Still, young Riddle was such an elegant, charming, devious, cold sort that I couldn't help but be enthralled by his commanding presence.*The climactic showdown between Harry and Tom was suspenseful and epic! Who'd have thought a scene between two teenagers would be as involving, deep, and exciting as any showdown between two adults? And they used words as weapons just as much as action and never sounded preachy or boring! An accomplishment indeed! *Of course, the adult cast the late great Richard Harris (Prof. Dumbledore, played by Michael Gambon in the later films), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) carry their loads in professional, brilliant fashion and allow the young actors to have their shining moments. Jason Isaacs was a great addition as Lucius Malfoy, a new foil for Harry Potter and the father of little Draco Malfoy (reliably malevolent Tom Felton, who has played the role since the beginning with his contemporaries Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson).*Moaning Myrtle! Special mention also goes to Shirley Henderson as the newly introduced character in this film. A great comic relief (but still essential to the plot) character! CoS is the one Harry Potter film where one can say that it follows the source material AND does not bore the viewer!",10,4,5,10 October 2009
The Departed," Scorcese finally gets his due!
","THE DEPARTED is the first Best Picture winner that I've seen in years that I've actually at least LIKED! And I'll go a step further to say that I REALLY, REALLY LIKE it! It is an excellent story, played brilliantly by all involved, and told by one of the greatest directors in all of film history: Martin Scorcese. Scorcese FINALLY won Best Director and a film of his won Best Picture for this modern masterpiece. Of course it's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, or even GOODFELLAS, but so what? It's better than 95% of the other stuff thrown at us the last few years! THE DEPARTED stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon as Bostonians Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan, respectively, both from opposite sides of the track. Costigan's father's side of the family has criminal ties, but he was actually raised apart from that w/ his mother's more uppercrust upstanding side of the family. Sullivan was a poor boy raised in the streets. That's how both characters came to be what they were as grown men: Billy was brought up away from crime and Colin was exposed directly to it. As a boy Colin unwittingly became involved with local crime boss Frank Costello (played by the great Jack Nicholson in typical scene-stealing fashion). Costigan and Sullivan both joined the police academy, with Costigan volunteering to go under deep cover to help take down Costello's organization, while Sullivan worked as Costello's inside man/mole to notify him when the cops were closing in on him.Costigan's only link to the cops is career cop Captain Queenan (Mr. Martin Sheen in terrific form) and his right hand man Lt. Dignam (Best Supporting Actor nominee Mark Wahlberg in a superb performance). Dignam and Queenan are the ONLY cops who know that Costigan is really one of the good guys as it was set up so that Billy would get thrown out of the police academy and thrown in jail for 18 months to help solidify his cover. Upon release from prison, Billy connects with his father's bad side of the family in order to ultimately get close to the PRIZE, Frank Costello himself.Meanwhile, the 'clean-cut' Sullivan ingratiates himself with the Boston PD's bigwigs, in particular, he is assigned to work with a task force led by Lt. Ellerby (played by the superb Alec Baldwin). Ellerby and Sullivan's job is to take Costello down. Very labyrinthine! The cop tasked to destroy Costello is really Costello's boy (Sullivan) and Costello's new boy in his organization is really a cop truly trying to take him down (Costigan)! The irony! Thankfully, this juicy main plot doesn't fail to deliver the goods. It is very tense, exciting, edge-of-your-seat stuff. You really hold your breath at times wondering what's going to happen. To complicate matters, obviously, neither Costigan nor Sullivan know each other, but both men know that the other EXISTS. Costigan knows that Costello has a police mole and Sullivan knows that the cops have a plant inside Costello's organization, so during the course of the film, they try to root each other out. To FURTHER complicate the proceedings, both men become involved with the SAME woman, a police psychiatrist Madolyn (played by the alluring Vera Farmiga). Sullivan meets her because they work in the same building and Costigan is one of her patients.Wow! What a cast! What a film! And very well told. I was never a big fan of DiCaprio's until I saw him in this film. He really delivers the goods as Billy, a tortured soul who begins to blur the line between right and wrong. And Damon is truly solid as Colin, a tragic, doomed individual who sadly got influenced by the wrong person in his formative years. Nicholson of course delivers with his flash, flair, and aplomb. And the rest of the cast is solid beyond words. Scorcese has fashioned a classic for the modern viewer, his best film since GOODFELLAS. This BEST PICTURE winner is a keeper! 'Bout damn time!",10,3,5,14 September 2008
Die Hard," The seminal action film
","DIE HARD is THE action movie to end all action movies! Bare bones, lean, direct, focused, THIS is the movie by which all action movies should be judged! It's amazing, but DIE HARD really created the action movie as we know it today. There were action films before, but not like this one. It is the template for modern day action films: the humdrum introduction of the movie's hero and his boring backstory (separated from wife and family, yadda yadda yadda), the minor characters that will factor in later on, the deliberate setup of relationships before the action begins, then enter the bad guys and the fun begins! I can't believe this, but 20 years ago when DIE HARD first came out, I thought no way would this work with Bruce Willis as the 'action' hero! This was the smarmy, smug guy from the TV show MOONLIGHTING for Chr*st's sake! But Willis totally rocks! He is so effortless in his portrayal of New York cop John McClane. You really feel like he IS John McClane. It's really one of the most underrated performances that I can remember! McClane is a new breed of action hero: he uses his brains, common sense, and street smarts as much as his muscle (of which he doesn't have a whole lot!). Watching McClane outsmart the bad guys is truly entertaining! The bad guys! Led by none other than Alan Rickman (who should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination), these guys are super-cool, relentless, foreign uber-thugs the likes of which had never been put to screen. Whenever you see scary, out-of-place, larger-than-life bad guys in action movies, remember, DIE HARD did it first (and still best). Rickman plays Hans Gruber, some self-proclaimed terrorist who is really out to steal a fortune in bearer bonds from the Nakatomi building. Hans is supersmart himself and has worked out a labyrinthine plan to carry out his objective.The Nakatomi building! Where ALL the action happens. A brilliant idea to have the action within the confines of this super-duper LA skyscraper. Easy for our hero to hide while he's outfoxing the baddies! The building is where our hero's wife, Holly Gennero, works. Holly is played exceptionally well by Bonnie Bedelia. Holly really humanizes McClane to the viewer and makes us realize he's not just some macho tough guy cop with no personal life. You just can't wait for these 2 to reconcile in the end.The action is very well done, indeed. Ironically, with all the explosions and shootouts, it doesn't feel overdone or tiresome, even upon further viewing. The film is so meticulous in it's attention to detail that you'd be hard pressed to find fault with it. The director John McTiernan did an amazing job.No sequels necessary (although there have been several). You can't top THIS original!",10,1,1,26 July 2008
Psycho," One of the top 5 films of all time!
","The irony of the film PSYCHO for me is that while I wasn't born when it came out in 1960 and didn't get to see it until some 20 years after its release, I actually DIDN'T know anything that happened in it when I first saw it! So the shock, awe, and surprise for me was the firsthand reactions of someone who had never seen or known anything about the film. Of course, that was back in an age where there was no internet, very few channels to watch on TV, and spoilers weren't put out forever and a day. I was lucky. I hope anyone who hasn't seen film and enjoys films is as lucky as I was.You know the story: THE GREATEST MACGUFFIN EVER TOLD! The great Alfred Hitchcock totally fools us into thinking that this masterwork is about retrieving a stolen $40,000 when in fact it is about SOOOOO much more than that! Marion Crane (played by the great Janet Leigh in a complex, sexy, heartbreaking performance) steals the money from her boss, an insurance agent, then 'steals' off (pun intended) 'into the night' (actually it was daytime) with the money. Along the way she has thoughts of various conflicting thoughts and emotions of the results of her actions and ends up at the Bates Motel.Ahh, the Bates Motel! The most famous location in all of film history! Marion meets the proprietor and manager Norman Bates (played by none other than Anthony Perkins in one of the most stunning, sterling, fascinating, perfect performances in film history). Norman is the mama's boy to end all mamas boys! The parlor conversation between Norman and Marion has got to be, to this day, one of the most fascinating talks between two lost souls ever put to screen. The angular way that Hitchcock shot it adds to its brilliance. The albeit too brief 'relationship' between Norman and Marion is never talked about enough for me: it's obvious that her sexuality intimidates him and is rather off-putting. And you can tell that she finds his sweetness and vulnerability a refreshing change from the big city jerks that she is used to. Two great performances, both of which should have won Oscars. Leigh was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and the fact that Perkins wasn't nominated for Best Actor may be the all time biggest oversight in Oscar history.PSYCHO is fascinating on so many levels and gets a lot about human nature right: the aforementioned sexuality that lies within all of us, the different levels of guilt that all humans possess (virtually every character in this film is guilty of SOMETHING), the ways that men objectify women, and fact that all of us at heart are shaped by our parents, whether we'd want to admit it or not.This is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film accomplishment for me, and that says a lot because he is my favorite director of all time. He got nominated for Best Director (the Academy got that part right), but didn't win (Academy got this one wrong). And PSYCHO is in the top 5 films of all time for me also. It is a landmark that ironically inspired thousands (maybe millions) knock-offs about psychotic mama-boy serial killers. But this is the film with the real heart and soul. No remakes, retreads, or sequels necessary.",10,0,1,31 May 2008
Joker," The Academy finally gets one right
","For a decade, I felt like the Oscars continued to overlook the truly greatest performances and films. I'm still salty that The Social Network didn't take home the Best Picture Oscar early in the decade and that neither The Conjuring (best film of 2013) nor Gone Girl (best film of 2014) barely got any, if any, major award recognition. Those movies are true masterworks, yet the Academy continues to award sentimental, forgettable drivel that no one will be re-visiting years from now. It took the entire decade of the 2010s for me to feel like the Academy got one right and they picked a good one to do it!JOKER (2019) may have gotten negative critical reviews, but thankfully, the movie-going voices were heard and the Academy seemed to go with people who pay to enjoy movies instead of the ones paid to critique them. This movie, no question in my mind, is easily one of the best films of the decade and may very well BE the best. And it came at just the right time, sneaking in at the very end. I promise, this film will hold up! People will be breaking it down and analyzing every inch and every frame for years and years to come. Who could have ever believed that when this century started, that 20 years later, one but TWO actors would take home the ultimate prize for essaying the most scrutinized and popular character in all of media history.Make no mistake, while I do truly think that Joker is a masterpiece, it stands tall on the shoulders of one of the most remarkable performances in film history, delivered by recent Best Actor Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Had Phoenix not taken home the grand prize, I would have conformed to the masses and threatened to riot! lol Phoenix was so spectacular, I'm re-evaluating whether or not Heath Ledger's Oscar back in 2008 was truly warranted, and Ledger wasn't even my favorite interpretation of Joker up to this point as I was way more entertained by Jack Nicholson in 1989's Batman and Cameron Monaghan in the late 2010s TV series Gotham. But Phoenix may be regarded as the culmination of all these fascinating interpretations.Set circa 1983 in Gotham City, Joker spins the tale of Arthur Fleck (Phoenix' character), a struggling comedian who works jobs as a clown around the metropolis. Arthur has a rare disorder which causes him to go into laughing fits at the most inappropriate times and that, along with having to take care of his physically and mentally incapacitated mother (superbly played by veteran Frances Conroy, who in my opinion deserved a Supporting Actress nomination), contributes to his severe shyness, lack of confidence, and social anxiety. To help him cope, every night Arthur watches a popular talk show hosted by Murray Franklin (brilliant performance by Robert DeNiro, who also deserved Oscar love as Supporting Actor). Arthur also gains a girlfriend during this story, his neighbor Sophie Drummond (well played by Zazie Beetz).Director Todd Phillips borrows heavily from Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, as the star of those movies Robert DeNiro has an important part in this one, essentially essaying a version of the Jerry Lewis character from Kind of Comedy. Much like Travis Bickle, Arthur is extremely quiet and a ticking time bomb and much like Rupert Pupkin, Arthur fancies himself a comedian and dreams of being famous and much like both characters, Arthur achieves a form of infamy in Joker.Joker is basically a 100% serious, psychological exercise, not the traditional lighthearted, by the numbers, comic book movie that's been flooding movie screens for the last 40 years. Make no mistake, I still admire entertaining comic book movies such as the Christopher Reeve Superman films, the Michael Keaton Batman films, Chris Nolan's Batman Begins, Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, but there's an obvious uniform beat to all those movies. Most of the other comic book movies aren't even worth mentioning, but at least those I mentioned have a ton of entertainment value and re-watchability.The aesthetic of Joker brilliantly captures the early 1980s without feeling like some parody or even homage to the decade. It's simply a unique tale set in a certain era and focuses on one of the most fascinating fictional characters in history. The movie didn't win Best Picture (as it should have), but at least the Academy rightfully acknowledges Phoenix's already legendary performance. When the popular phrase 'the hype is real' was first spoken, whoever said it was definitely thinking of Joker.",10,5,9,11 February 2020
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Great film from a year of great movies.
","Man, 1957! What a year of great films: 12 ANGRY MEN, PATHS OF GLORY, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Sometimes, I think that 1957 gets forgotten as being one of the great years of films and that's a shame. BRIDGE won Best Picture in this year, one of the very few in film history that I think is at least deserving. That said, PATHS OF GLORY is amongst the top 10 films of all time as far as I'm concerned, but I don't think it was released immediately in the U.S. in 1957, so I can forgive the Academy that one!This film is about a band of British POWs at a Japanese internment camp in the Burmese jungle during mid-WWII. They are led by career military man Colonel Nicholson (Best Actor Oscar winner Sir Alec Guiness) and the camp's Commander Saito forces Nicholson and his men to build a railroad bridge which trains will be able to cross to transport enemy troops and dignitaries, and to get supplies to enemy forces. Nicholson, ever the 'loyal' British officer, agrees to build a quality bridge in exchange for Saito treating his men in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some of his officers question Nicholson's collusion with Saito and wonder about his patriotism. Also questioning Nicholson's motives are an American POW Shears (William Holden, who actually has top billing in this film and gives a terrific performance in his own right). Shears escapes the camp, only to be drafted by Major Warden (2nd billed Jack Hawkins) to be part of a team of Allied soldiers to return to the camp to destroy the bridge. Shears is necessary to lead the expedition since he was at the camp and could lead them the quickest route to get there.The film speaks a lot about the duality of man: on the one hand as 'prisoners' of war, Nicholson wanted he and his men to be treated accordingly to the Geneva convention, but he knew that to get this treatment, he had to make compromises with Saito; on the other hand, they were prisoners of 'war' and Saito is the enemy and it is unspoken rule that you should never collude with the enemy, even if it means mistreatment and taking uncalled for punishment. Nicholson is very prideful, prim, and proper and let these properties shine through. In his mind, he was doing his duty as a 'British' soldier, but in the end realized that what he was really doing was betraying the core values of what it really meant to be a British 'soldier'.The film is also very watchable, even today. You get completely enthralled by the story and characters. It never seems dated. The climactic bridge-destroying scene at the end always blows me away (no pun intended). And the last line in the film is one I've never forgotten and sums up the point of the whole film. A true classic.",10,8,10,14 March 2008
Scream 2," Not as good as the first one....Surprise!
","While I will give SCREAM 2 (1998) credit for it's great opening with (uncredited?) Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett, it's definitely not as good as it's predecessor (the groundbreaking Scream from 1996 that re-generated the horror genre). To repeat, the opening to Scream 2 is cool with that wonderful dialogue between Epps and Pinkett and the similar tongue-in-cheek approach that opened 1.Scream 2 again stars engaging Neve Campbell as eternal victim Sydney Prescott. Campbell still brings it as the centerpiece of the story. Also back from 1 are David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Courtney Cox as Anchorwoman Gail Weathers as well as Jamie Kennedy as Randy, all survivors of the bloodbath from 1.The action in 2 shifts to college as Sydney and Randy are attending a local university. The main cast from part 1 to part 2 seems to be multiplied by 4! Added to the mix is an eclectic group of familiar young actors (Jerry O'Connell, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Duane Martin, etc.!). I think this is part of the problem as the film is an uneasy mix of the main actors from 1 along with all these new faces in 2. There's too much exposition as half of Scream 2 spends time referring back to 1.There seems to be too much going on in Scream 2 and most of it is pretty boring. The dialogue and scenes leading up to the big kill moments have no wit, bite or humor like in the first movie. Characters pop in and out of nowhere adding nothing to the proceedings. And certainly the ending isn't nearly as sharp, surprising, or suspenseful as in Part 1.The main problem with 2 is that it really is just a standard horror movie, while 1 was more ingenious in it's homage to slasher flicks.",Null,0,1,27 August 2011
Jaws," Spielberg's greatest directorial achievement
","You know the story of JAWS. Small New England seaside town Amity is moving normally towards summer when, out of nowhere comes a killer shark. Not seen until halfway through the film, the shark is an ominous, almost omnipotent presence felt throughout the entire film, even from the beginning.An attractive young girl is swimming and gets taken in one of the great opening scenes in film history. She feels something bite her, drag her in all directions, then she disappears underwater. Her boyfriend reports her missing and her body is found by local police the next morning all chewed up and spit out along the shore. The Amity police chief is Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider in his greatest film role). When he and his deputy find the body, they immediately quarantine the beach and post signs to stay away, but the Mayor (played effectively by Murray Hamilton) will have none of that since local businesses will lose lots of money during the tourist season if the beaches are closed. The beaches stay open and a young boy is killed by the shark on the first day of tourist season.It appears as if some of the local fisherman have caught 'the shark' when a oceanographic expert on sharks named Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss in a totally winning and expert performance) shows up in Amity to assist Chief Brody in finding and catching the real shark. Hooper immediately does an autopsy of the girl eaten in the opening scene and verifies that a 'great white shark' did this. One of the many memorable great lines of this film come shooting out of his mouth 'This was not a boating accident!' The day Hooper arrives, while all the fisherman are patting themselves on the back and everyone is celebrating the shark 'capture', something unexpected happens. The mother of the boy that was killed, dressed in all black funeral garb, walks up to Chief Brody and slaps him for not closing the beaches even though he knew a man-eating shark was out there (of course we know this isn't all his fault). This one scene has always stuck out with me from the film. It is very realistic and shows how people can really take their grief and anger out on the wrong person, but this moment served as a kind of closure for the woman and as a wake-up call for Brody. From this moment on, Brody takes everything that Hooper says seriously and wants to be sure that the real shark is still not out there.Hooper does indeed verify to Brody that the shark is still out there by cutting open the captured shark and verifying no signs of human consumption. But the stubborn mayor still keeps the beaches open not believing them. As expected, the shark attacks again, this time almost killing Brody's son. NOW the Mayor has to pay attention. A town meeting is held and Brody and the Mayor tell them they need to hire professional shark hunters. Then another great moment occurs. An annoying, screeching sound is heard. It's a man scraping a blackboard with his fingernails to get everyone's attention. That man is Quint (played by Robert Shaw in a role that he should forever be remembered for). Quint is a local fisherman who is extremely knowledgeable about the sea and sharks (we'll find out why later) says he'll catch the shark for the right price. Eventually they agree and Brody, Hooper, and Quint (reluctantly) join forces to go after the great white.The adventure begins. The 3 men go after the great white in Quint's boat. An uneasy alliance forms amongst the 3 men, as they each argue with each other and get on each other's nerves early on. Quint is old school and thinks all of Hooper's technical equipment is hogwash, while Hooper thinks Quint is too rigid and primitive. Brody is like a 3rd wheel as he's not a seamen at all and he hates the water! At a totally unexpected moment, THE SHARK appears, then Brody in a frozen state slowly walks back towards Quint and says 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' (maybe the best line in film history). This is followed by one of my all time favorite film sequences as the 3 men scramble to do what each of them do best to kill the shark. They fail at first, but slowly bond during the trip. One night, while drunk, Quint and Hooper compare sea scars, then Quint tells the story of how he got this one scar while he was a sailor on the USS Indianapolis which got bombed and sank while he and his fellow survivors were stuck in shark-infested waters waiting for rescue. This dialogue is famous for being completely scripted by Robert Shaw himself and he delivers it perfectly.Needless to say, they get one final chance to catch the shark and in this long sequence that climaxes the film, the tension builds from moment to moment as they try everything to catch the shark and as the shark goes all out in trying to eat up the men and the boat itself. A great movie.This, for me, is Steven Spielberg's best directorial effort. I love his later work too, but JAWS is a perfect film. Not a weak moment in it. I love the Hitchcockian elements of building tension and suspense, the Kubrickian elements of overlapping dialogue and long scenes that are totally enthralling and not boring, the great background music, and quotable, memorable dialogue. Ironic that this perfect film inspired all the fake, unrealistic, over-the-top, unsuspenseful summer crap they make nowadays. JAWS should never be mistaken as one of these films.It was nominated for Best Picture in 1975 (should have won) and won the 3 other Oscars it was nominated for (Editing, Sound, and of course Score). Spielberg was robbed by not even getting a Best Director nom.",10,3,7,28 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas' STAR WARS prequels comes to an end....thankfully!
","So George Lucas decides to tell the prequel story to his original STAR WARS trilogy. Good idea, right? Think again! When the films started previewing during commercial breaks starting 10 years ago, I was sure to be pleased with the final product. Overall, thumbs down. I rather enjoyed the fast pace, energy and focus of EPISODE I:THE PHANTOM MENACE, which reminded me a lot of the original STAR WARS. But EPISODE II:ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a gawd-awful experience! To reiterate, MENACE is definitely the better than CLONES, and just might be better than this film STAR WARS, EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. While SITH is a vast improvement over CLONES, that is not necessarily saying much as CLONES is about as bad as film-making (if that's what you want to call it) gets! SITH concludes the prequel trilogy by showing how Anakin Skywalker (again played by Hayden Christensen from CLONES; it was Jake Lloyd in MENACE) turns to evil. Christensen redeems himself nicely here, although I thought that the overuse of CGI and terrible dialogue in CLONES doomed not just his acting in that film, but everyones! Anakin is a Jedi now, no longer an apprentice and he and his old Master and now best friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor looking more stately and dignified as we can see him morphing into the older Ob-Wan in the original trilogy) are on a mission to rescue Senator Palpatine (Shakespearean actor Ian McDarmid) from the clutches of Count Dooku (veteran Christopher Lee), the main villain who escaped at the end of CLONES. Anakin and Obi-Wan save Palpatine and Anakin kills Dooku cold-bloodedly, further moving him towards the Dark Side.Back on Coruscant, Anakin and Padme (beautiful Natalie Portman) (who secretly married at the end of CLONES) reunite after his return from the Clone Wars and she informs him she is pregnant (we know where this is going!). Anakin has a dream that Padme dies in childbirth and gets advice from Palpatine on how he can save her using a power he learned from the powerful Sith Lord Darth Plageus. So this is how and why Anakin turns? OK. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan is on a mission to stop separatist military leader General Grievous and Yoda on a mission to help the Wookies on their home planet. Both are backed up by the newly created Clone Army from CLONES.Although SITH has a lot of action and is more cohesive than CLONES, I still find a lot of the CGI distracting at times and it all feels rushed b/c Lucas has to conclude the story here to set up the original trilogy. I actually think some of this should have happened in, or replaced some of the story in CLONES. A lot of it seemed rather pointless: Dooku, Grievous, and the separatist movement are irrelevant since Darth Sidious, AKA Palpatine, betrays the movement and destroys it in one fell swoop so the Empire can be created! This storyline was never really explored except near the end of CLONES. Feels like it should have been more developed and fleshed out and not treated as a sidebar.Additionally, I realized that Anakin in both CLONES and SITH is not given much to do, action-wise. I think the boy Anakin from MENACE had more adventure and got into more scrapes than the teenage and young adult Anakin in CLONES and SITH combined! The Jedi are taken down way too easily by Clones and it seems like Yoda, the all powerful Jedi, should have seen it all coming. But the biggest letdown is how so easily Anakin betrays the Jedi and kills Mace Windu (commanding Samuel L. Jackson). That 'key' scene really does not work.The 'final' battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is long, drawn out, and generally exciting and their 'final' confrontation has some sadness and power to it. Also Anakin and Padme's relationship is definitely more convincing than in CLONES and their end is kind of tragic. Of course the last scenes set up the events of the original trilogy. Overall, SITH is a good movie, but in terms of the STAR WARS saga, rather disappointing. Too bad.",5,1,3,18 August 2009
Bring It On," An entertaining flick about cheerleaders? Who knew?!
","BRING IT ON is just plain fun! A smart, lighthearted, engaging teen flick for the modern audience. And it actually isn't just some mindless teen comedy that goes nowhere. It has a plot! And a point...Cheerleading matters! Who knew a flick about competitive cheerleading could be fun! Starring the refreshing Kirsten Dunst (I find her more likable in this than any of those SPIDERMAN films) as Torrance Shipman, the leader of Cheerleading Toros (5-time defending national champion), BRING IT ON is nonstop entertainment. With her sidekick Missy Pantone (sexy Eliza Dushku), Torrance must maintain the Toros winning ways by coming up with new cheers for the team, since the former leader (now in college) stole the old cheers from the Compton squad (led by Gabrielle Union, who plays Isis, who looks like a high schooler about as much as one of the Golden Girls does!). Yeah, b/c all girls in Compton look like Gabrielle Union!The supporting cast is great, especially Torrance's annoying cheerleading mates Courtney and Whitney and Isis' right hand Darcy. These girls ALMOST steal the show. Show-stealing honors go to the 'spirit fingers' guy Sparky, whose scenes are just plain hilarious! That scene alone puts this film on another level! 'Don't speak!'Needless to say, this is an us-versus-them story and the film builds to an exciting climax at the national competition where the Toros must battle the Compton squad for the honors. Personally, I think the wrong squad won, but that's just me. Still, a fun movie experience!",9,0,0,12 September 2008
Inception," Very entertaining, but NOT some influential masterpiece!
","Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan scores with the general movie-going audience once again with his highly anticipated film INCEPTION (2010). The hook for this film is it's exploration into the concept and idea of 'dreams'. Frankly, my immediate response when I saw this film was that the it's definition of dreams seems to be more based on NOLAN's interpretation and not the general consensus! Some of it sounded correct, while some of it sounded like mumbo jumbo! At the same time, Nolan essentially executes the dream aspects of the movie within his own set of rules and more or less does not violate them, which is actually part of the problem. In the big picture, I don't think dreams work the way this movie portrays them.INCEPTION stars Leonardo DiCaprio as dream expert extractor Cobb. DiCaprio gives a passable performance, but it's not anything mesmerizing or Oscar-caliber. Frankly, I think that this actor is probably the most overrated major star of the last decade. It's partially that he's a victim of his eternal youthful look, so it makes it hard to take him seriously in these 'adult' roles; I feel like he's being forced upon me as a star, rather than truly being one! Unlike when he was a teen actor in the early to mid 90s, I don't find him very engaging as an adult actor. He simply doesn't draw me in. And, actually, in this movie, I was more engaged by the other ensemble's performances more than his. He felt like a 5th wheel, especially since it was his character that was actually an impediment to the mission succeeding.The real acting standouts in the film for me were Cillian Murphy and former Best Actress Oscar winner Marion Cotillard. Murphy plays the team's target Robert Fischer, whose billionaire industrialist father had recently died, so Cobb's team was on an assignment, paid by Fischer's main competitor Saito (a solid Ken Watanabe) to implant an idea in his mind to liquidate his father's empire. Murphy did a much better job showing depth and character detail than DiCaprio, whose tale was actually more tragic, with his dreams haunted by the memory of his late wife Mal (hauntingly played by Cotillard, and I actually didn't realize it was her until the end credits rolled!). The capable supporting cast playing Cobb's 'dream team' is led by up and coming star Ellen Page (as Ariadne, a specialist in architecture, who constructs the dream landscape for the film's big mission). Although she was underused mainly as a fascinated observer and Cobb's support, I found Page to be very engaging. After constructing the dream landscape, Ariadne's assignment was to protect Cobb from his demonic subconscious in the form of his late wife Mal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine also as Arthur, Cobb's sidekick who monitors the dreamers to ensure that they eventually get 'kicked' (treated rather flimsily in this movie!) out of them. Tom Hardy is also good as Eames, a forger whose expertise is needed in the dreams to shapeshift his appearance to the dreamer. Dileep Rao soundly functions as chemist Yusef, creator of the drug that will allow the team to go into 3 levels of dream states in order to execute the mission.Where INCEPTION actually drew me in was in the last half, with it's steamrolling action sequences as the dreamers went from level to level, which I did not expect at all! I thought this was going to be some kind of mind-bending, trippy exercise, which it really wasn't. The way the movie portrays dreaming is actually very pat and linear, and the miniscule complexity is what allows the viewer to follow and be more engaged in the action. That is, while not completely mindless (pardon the pun!), the dream state stuff is pretty easy to follow. Also, Nolan did a good job of defining how the different levels work in the film's opening sequence.My biggest complaint about the film is it's rather simplistic way of describing dreams, and this ties in with the DiCaprio character Cobb, who was the biggest detriment to the mission because of his subconscious drawing his wife Mal into the dreams at inopportune moments. Other than the dreamer himself, why weren't any of the other teams subconscious in the dreams coming into play? Basically, Cobb was the only team member whose subconscious posed a wild card threat, which is hard to believe. If you take Cobb out of the equation, the mission runs a lot smoother than it actually did. Cobb is the only reason for a true threat to exist and for there to be any suspense, and after a while, I found the Cobb-Mal stuff to be more of a distraction than an important plot point. Minus Cobb, the movie is really just a simple action flick with no true threats in the dreams other than the main dreamer's typical subconscious threats, which were basically a bunch of useless gun-toting brutes who couldn't hit the side of a barn! Again, it was all very entertaining, but definitely not groundbreaking.INCEPTION was nominated for Best Picture, in part I think due to the fact that there are 10 nominations now. Chances are it would not have been nominated if there were only still 5 since Nolan himself didn't garner a Best Director nomination. Enteraining experience, but definitely not Oscar-worthy.",8,5,7,31 May 2011
The Conjuring," Best horror film in a LONG time!
","For whatever reason, I had this feeling that THE CONJURING (2013) would be a great horror film! I had heard the hype (which usually means nothing), but in seeing some of the previews, it just felt like the real deal. After having recently gotten around to seeing it, my feeling has been confirmed! The Conjuring is a masterful addition to the horror genre, cleverly combining elements and ideas from many previous famous horror films, including The Exorcist, The Evil Dead, The Shining, Poltergeist, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. But The Conjuring still feels like it's own entity, thanks to great acting, genuine dialogue from a solid script, and moments of true and sheer shock and terror.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga head a superb cast. Wilson and Farmiga convincingly play Ed and Lorraine Warren, a married couple who specialize in dealing with demonic spirits and possession. The start of the film is 1968, when they help a couple of nurse roommates deal with a possessed doll that was terrorizing them. Flashforward to 1971, the setting of this 'true' story, where we are introduced to the Perron family, who have recently moved to a country home in the upper Northeastern U.S. The large family consists of the parents Carolyn and Roger (excellently played by Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their 5 girls Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April (convincingly played by Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, and Kyla Deaver). I was IMMENSELY impressed by ALL the young actresses playing the daughters! They were all so in-sync with their roles, that none of them came across as the typical, annoying, unrealistic kids that are showcased in film. Their shock, awe, and terror seemed truly genuine.The Perrons find that their new home is occupied by several ghosts that appear in different portions of the house (the basement, their bedrooms, etc.) Early on, one of the ghosts manages to kill their dog, then as things get eerier, they enlist the help of The Warrens to exorcise the demons from their home. The Warrens research reveal that the home was owned back in the 19th century by Bathsheba, the descendant of a witch. Bathsheba, possessed by her ancestor, kills her newborn, then hung herself on a tree in front of the house, but not before cursing ANYONE who bought and resided on her land in the future.With the aid of their assistant Drew (solidly played by Shannon Kook) and a local deputy (scene-stealer John Brotherton), the Warrens then set up shop in the Perrons house with a bunch of technical equipment (recorders, cameras, booby traps) to try to capture the spirits, as well as to protect the family from mortal danger.The acting by all involved is exceptional, very naturalistic, without being underplayed or too monotone. The reactions seem believable and the emotions ring true. The cinematography and camera angles really accentuate the horror moments, which are perfectly timed and placed.I can't remember the last time that a horror film actually SCARED me as much as this one! There are many chilling, spine-tingling moments that made me literally shake and jump out of my seat. This is not easy to do, after having seen what seems like a MILLION horror films! Director James Wan (who previously directed the masterful and original horror film Saw 10 years prior to this film, essentially creating a new genre of horror film) went old-school with The Conjuring and fashioned a throwback, invigorating, scary horror masterpiece!",10,1,3,12 November 2013
Scream," The teen slasher genre is re-born!
","It's proved very difficult to re-boot long gone genres that defined early Hollywood (the Western, the musical, gangster films). There has been limited success of each case, but in actuality, only one genre has been (for better or worse) re-booted to extreme success in the last decade and that is the horror/slasher film. That success can be directly attributed to SCREAM (1996)! And not just the teen variety (URBAN LEGEND, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, CRY WOLF, etc.), but also films like SAW, HOSTEL, and a host of other horror films. Just base on influence alone, SCREAM deserves a place in the history of film.While SCREAM essentially references all the old 70s-80s slasher flicks (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Friday THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN), make no mistake, the film itself is a highly original, involving experience with a witty script, a solid story, and excellent performances. The film starts with former teen icon/idol Drew Barrymore (perfect in her small role as Casey Becker, her real last chance to play a 'teenager' before time just plain takes over!) getting a 'wrong number' phone call from a mysterious weirdo, who quizzes her about those famed slasher flicks and their villains (Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers). But this is no ordinary quiz: the caller has kidnapped and tortured Casey's boyfriend. If Casey doesn't answer the questions correctly, her boyfriend is dead and so is she. This opening scene is both terrifying and tongue-in-cheek.Cut to our story's heroine Sydney Prescott (a perfectly cast Neve Campbell from PARTY OF FIVE TV show fame). Sydney's mom was murdered a year before (the killer is in jail) and she lives with her father. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis (excellently played by Skeet Ulrich) is sensitive to her situation but wants to consummate their relationship. Their best friends are Tatum, Stuart, and Randy (Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard, and Jamie Kennedy in solid performances). They soon find out about Casey Becker's demise and postulate who the killer might be and the motive. Of course, they reference every slasher flick known to man while doing it! Separately investigating the crime is Tatum's brother Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley and up-and-coming investigative reporter Gale Weathers (real-life couple David Arquette and Courtney Cox rounding out the perfect cast). Eventually, all parties collide at the climactic teen weekend party where the real culprit is revealed.SCREAM, while having a memorable beginning and end, also has an extremely solid middle act and that is vital. It is fun thinking along with the characters trying to figure out what is really going on. And the final reveal is a humdinger! But even knowing the ending, it is so memorable and well-executed that you want to watch over and over again. The modern day slasher flick all starts here with SCREAM!",10,1,2,30 June 2009
Prometheus," Scott drops the ball big time!
","Ridley Scott's highly anticipated film PROMETHEUS (2012) falls short of it's tremendous expectations. A prequel to Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece 'Alien', 'Prometheus' tries to be several things, and in doing so, really ends up about nothing. The film plays like an uneasy blend of 2001, Alien, and Aliens, with even a nod to Lawrence of Arabia. Of course it would contain elements of the latter two movies, as it occurs in the same universe as 'Alien'. It has philosophical and religious overtones, but they are presented in an extremely clunky way.The film's plot is that in the late 21st century, archaeologists and lovers Shaw (Naomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave drawings that are indicative of the creator alien race of 'Engineers' on the distant planet LV-223. The Weyland Corporation funds the mission, led by corporate bigwig Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) with her android sidekick David (Michael Fassbender) maintaining the ship while the crew is on life-support for the 2-year journey to the planet. The crew also includes the captain Janek (Idris Elba, sporting a weird accent), medic Ford (Kate Dickie), punker geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and geeky biologist Millburn (Rafe Spall). Upon arrival, David brings the crew out of cryogenic stasis and they land on the planet to investigate.The film doesn't work for a variety of reasons: (1) The plot is paper thin, explaining away the origin of man too simplistically. The overarching theme of this film is stolen right from 2001. The Engineer at the film's start is basically the 'monolith' from 2001, but with the added 'bonus' of initiating life on Earth, not just providing basic knowledge, like the apes in 2001. The archaeologists who discovered the cave drawings are substitute for the moon expedition that discovered the monolith. The 4-year flash forward to the Prometheus-LV223 expedition? Same as the jump to the Discovery-Jupiter expedition in 2001! (2) The viewer is 'treated' to too many scenes of characters unconvincingly spouting off nonsense about creation and the meaning of life. The convos are incredibly forced and inorganic. The actors don't even seem to believe in the dialog! And there are WAY too many 'confused look' moments where characters look clueless, and I guess WE are supposed to be curious or afraid along with them or trying to figure out what they're thinking, but I found myself frustrated because NOTHING was really happening. (2) Except for ironically David, all the characters are incredibly one-dimensional and lifeless. Most of them don't even seem like scientists or explorers, except for perhaps Shaw, who at least exudes an aura of being a person of deep thought and reason (if you ignore the 'hunch' part). Holloway comes across almost like an overbearing frat boy, who seems more interesting in consuming alcohol than in the mission itself; I didn't buy his character for a second. Plus, Shaw and Holloway are not convincing as lovers at all, possessing no chemistry. Vickers is essentially a watered-down female version of Burke from 'Aliens', a company lady who only looks out for number one, except she actually has no ulterior motive. That 'honor' belongs to android David, who seems to be a mixture of Ash from 'Alien' and Burke/Bishop from 'Aliens'. Although well-played by Fassbender (in the film's ONLY good performance), David remains an enigma. The geologist-biologist duo Fifield and Millburn don't even seem to care about the mission at all, do NOT seem like men of science, and are literally useless! Fifield says he's in it for the money (didn't know research was THAT lucrative) and Millburn, for whatever reason, is content in being Fifield's best bud. You've just found the origins of life as we know it and you traveled for TWO YEARS to this point so you could blow it off and lay back on the ship doing nothing?(3) After what happened to a couple of the characters upon being exposed to the alien DNA, why would Weyland STILL want to use it to try and cure him? The 2 crew members who were exposed went bonkers and ended up wreaking havoc, and their bodies could take it because they were young men. No way a man Weyland's age (he looked at least in his 90s!) could survive that! (4)Characters just automatically believed each other's theories without any further debate or investigation. Character A makes a theory, then Characters B through Z believes them! (5) The ending with Janek (the film's most frustrating character, mainly because of Elba's decision to use an odd Southern accent, but also he just acts weird throughout the whole film) and his borderline mute co-pilots was strange to say the least and ties into my point #4. No character in this movie has a discernible personality!I found the setting of this movie to be incredibly dull, static, and uninteresting. Scott spent a lot of money and effort to create one of the most drab Hollywood sets I've ever seen. Most of the 'action' takes place in that Engineer 'cave', with characters just spouting off nonsense dialog and acting odd for much of the film's run.Now, to the BEST part of this film: Figuring out how it ties into 'Alien', because at the very least it's interesting picking out the 'Alien' easter eggs (no pun intended!) that are throughout the film. It's at least fun comparing parts of this weak movie to an actual GOOD one! Of course the ending itself is a hoot, but overall this movie is 2 hours of nothing happening to get there. I think I give the film 1 star for David, 1 star for Shaw's body (you'll know what I mean when you see it!), 1 star for the easter eggs, and finally 1 star for the ending!",4,2,5,29 May 2014
Paths of Glory," Perhaps the truly greatest war film of all time
","I wish we could give a film more than a 10 out of 10 rating. Because PATHS OF GLORY is one of the very few films that I'd give an 11! It is perfection. Plain and simple. It is a bare bones film, very short, and cuts to the chase. There are several fairly long scenes, yet none of them seem long and there are no wasted words, thoughts, or moments in any of the scenes. They are all perfect. Perfection is maybe an overused word, but not in this film. Directed by the great Stanley Kubrick and coming out in a great year of films 1957, this could very well be Kubrick's true greatest accomplishment.Paths of Glory takes place during WWI, but is it a war film? Debatable. It's about a regiment of French soldiers on the front lines forced into an impossible, unwinnable situation to take the 'Ant Hill' by their power-mad regimental commander General Mireau (played to 100% cold, selfish, heartless perfection by George Macready). The attack is unsuccessful (as expected) and Mireau literally wants blood for the failure (he even orders fire upon his own men for cowering back to the trenches during the unwinnable battle). The battle itself, while extremely short for a large scale assault, is technically executed to perfection with long-view wide, tracking shots of all the action so you can see everything at once. And in the middle of all of this action is brigade commander Colonel Dax (played by Kirk Douglas in truly the most impressive performance of his legendary career). Colonel Dax orders his men to return back to battle, but to no avail. He finally sees it as unwinnable as his men.In the aftermath, Mireau wants multiple executions to take place, but 'compromises' so that one man from each company in the front line battalion will be court-martialed for cowardice. 3 soldiers Paris, Ferol, and Arnaud (played by Ralph Meeker, Tim Carey, and Joe Turkel) are chosen for various reasons (one by lot, one b/c his unpopularity, and one b/c he knew of his company commander's part in a soldier's death). Col. Dax, a lawyer in the civilian world, represents the men. The trial is pure, military hogwash. Dax isn't allowed to present crucial information that could exonerate the men and the tribunal looks like they have already decided the men are guilty before the trial even starts. Dax has one final chance to save the men as he is given critical information by the gunnery commander that Mireau ordered him to fire upon his own men. Dax takes it to Mireau's superior General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) in hopes of getting a stay of execution for the men, but to no avail.The film has a lot of great, memorable characters and moments that stay in the minds of the viewer long after the film is over: (1) the cockroach scene, (2) two men discussing how they would prefer to be killed (slowly or quickly, with a knife or with a gun), (3) the company commander (in charge of the execution) who wrongly chose Pvt.Paris to be tried apologizing to him before the fateful execution and Paris nodding his head in forgiveness, (4) Dax telling off Broulard calling him a degenerate and that he can go to hell. (5) And finally, there's the great ending, perhaps the most memorable moment of the film where a captured German girl (Stanley Kubrick's real life wife) who sang that melancholy tune that the French soldiers hummed to in sadness as she sang it, perhaps thinking about their wrongly executed comrades in arms.Paths of Glory says a lot about not only the military, but also society itself. There are haves and have nots, those who rule and those who are ruled, the privileged and the lower class. It's a war film in the sense that it accurately depicts the grittiness and grunge of it. It's an anti-war film in the way it portrays the lunacy of parts of it, like the unwinnable attack on the Ant Hill that would have had no meaningful outcome on the war itself. It's a social film in the way it clearly delineates the high-ranking military (the establishment) and the rank-and-file soldiers (the working class). It's an anti-establishment film in that it portrays the high-ranking officers as power-hungry, self-absorbed fat cats who only want recognition. Who's the real enemy? Those we fight against or those who we thought are supposed to be on our side protecting us, but literally sending us to our slaughter to gain promotions? But most importantly, it's a human film b/c it accurately depicts all different types of human beings, each one delineated clearly so that the viewer can either relate to b/c we know that's how we would act or react or either abhor and despise b/c we'd like to believe that we, or no human being, could possibly act that way.",10,1,2,27 March 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Uneasy mix of genuine chills and 'Hollywood'
","SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991), based on the major awards that it won (Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress) could be considered the most overrated film of the 90s. While the film has it's plusses, it fails for me in being a purely chilling horror movie, which is what I think it should be. I'm not as enamored of Jonathan Demme's psychological yarn as so many others.First and foremost, SOTL is a boring movie! The first scene between Oscar-winning stars Jodie Foster (as FBI recruit Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (as imprisoned psychotic Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter) is definitely a keeper. Much as I don't like this movie, I DO really like that intense early scene! But everything after that just drags...and drags...and drags! Foster and Hopkins, while good, do not IMHO give Oscar-worthy performances. Foster's 'Southern' accent is fairly overwrought and phony and Hopkins kind of hams it up too much as Lecter. They really don't embody their characters so much as they are just 'acting'. Foster is basically a made-to-order female hero for everyone to fawn over and Hopkins is there for entertainment value only.Now, there ARE scary parts to SOTL, just none involving Hannibal. The real scary parts are of Starling's prey Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine in a genuinely creepy performance) and his latest hostage Catherine (Brooke Smith in an authentic performance). The scenes of Bill's dungeon are very unsettling. But everything revolving around the capture (the investigation, the dead ends, the MacGuffins, etc.) is the standard Hollywood storyline. It was obvious from the get-go that Starling was going to catch Bill, but the way it was done was extremely pedestrian.SOTL isn't even the best film with 'Hannibal'. That honor goes to the superior Michael Mann-directed film Manhunter from 1986, which is much more involving, intense, and satisfying. It has a better, more believable hero (William Peterson's Will Graham), a better Hannibal (Brian Cox), and an even better antagonist (Tom Noonan's multi-layered Francis Dollarhyde). Manhunter was a police procedural, but also took the time to develop and delve into the psyche of it's characters. SOTL seems to be more interested in putting on a show. Then again, showmanship is what usually wins Oscars!",5,1,6,28 July 2011
Tombstone," Doesn't deserve all the accolades
","In re-visiting this film recently, I've come to the conclusion that there are really no great Westerns post-1980! The most notable 80s Western is probably Silverado (from 85), which while being somewhat entertaining, is entirely too long with too many somber, interchangeable characters. And, yes, I'm counting 'Unforgiven(from 92)' in the list of dull post- 1980s Westerns with it's pompous sense of self-importance and array of forgettable characterizations. Also, there is the ambitious yet monumentally monotonous 'Wyatt Earp(from 94)', which somehow manages to go LOWER than both Silverado and Unforgiven in terms of underperforming. It's an ironic twist because Silverado and Wyatt Earp both feature Kevin Costner and Costner basically stole Silverado as a minor character giving the liveliest, most engaging performance while being the polar opposite in Wyatt Earp, a super-serious, somber, eternally sad lawman.This film that I'm reviewing TOMBSTONE (1993) is the polar opposite of those 3 movies. Instead of 'lack of', there is 'too much of'. Too many characters who blatantly over-act and shout their lines. Scenes punctuated with overdramatic, pumped-up music that's supposed to engage and move the viewer, but instead sounds extremely annoying. Too simplistic, unreal sounding dialog that comes across as laughable upon close scrutiny.'Tombstone' stars the usually reliable Kurt Russell as the infamous lawman Wyatt Earp, who arrives in the lawless frontier town circa 1880 via train along with his brothers Virgil (played by vet Sam Elliott, probably my 3rd fave performance in the movie; will get to the other 2 later) and Morgan (played by comical character actor Bill Paxton in a rather bad performance), their respective wives, including Wyatt's common-law wife Maddie (earnestly played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson). Upon arrival, Wyatt and his clan meet up with his longtime associate Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in a performance deserved of an Oscar nomination). So we've come to my BEST performance in this otherwise lacking film. Kilmer really rises to the occasion delivering an energetic, career-defining performance. But sadly, virtually no one else in the film is even HALF as good as Kilmer. Unlike the rest of the cast, Kilmer balances out the bombast with empathy, compelling the viewer to root and feel for his character. It may not be the most accurate portrayal of the famed dentist-turned-gunfighter, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.The other significant group in the large ensemble are the actors playing 'The Cowboys', the nemeses of the Earp clan and Holliday. The Cowboys are played by Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo, my 2nd favorite performance), Powers Boothe (as leader Curly Bill Brosius), Stephen Lang (as Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (as Billy Clanton), and Michael Rooker (as McMasters), in addition to several other character actors. Except for Ringo, these characters are all too 1-dimensional as villains with absolutely no layers. They're hateable, but not relatable, again Biehn's solid portrayal of the educated, contemplative Ringo being the exception, which is another problem I had: Ringo disappears for huge chunks of this movie yet I feel he was the most important member of the Cowboys.Additionally, there's a terrible tacked-on 'love story' between Wyatt and town newcomer Josie (played by Dana Delany), a travelling acting troupe performer. Josie is supposedly the femme fatale role in this movie, but it's hardly believable that Wyatt would be so enamored with a rather plain-looking woman who's about as sexy as a root canal! The acting troupe includes an effeminate actor (played by Billy Zane, getting in early practice for his over-the-top villainous role in 'Titanic'). Like most of the actors in this movie, Zane thought this was a Broadway play! Then there are odd characters like Jason Priestley's who literally just occupy space and give nothing to the proceedings. And I didn't buy for a second Russell as a tough lawman. Too many characters folded against him and I didn't find him intimidating in the least.The acting in this movie isn't very good, but the script has to take a lot of the blame. Much of the dialog is extremely odd, the tone of the film meanders clumsily among elements of comedy, melodrama, and existentialism. It takes itself WAY too seriously to even be taken serious by the viewer. In actuality, I used to think this film was re-watchable, but lately, I see that it's good for maybe only a couple of viewings. The revenge angle is nice because it's always fun to see truly bad guys get their comeuppance, but the characterizations are so poor, you don't really care by the end of the movie. You just want to get to the end!",3,11,23,27 December 2014
Bull Durham," Life, sex, and baseball. Baseball, life, and sex.
","What is Bull Durham about? On the surface, it's about baseball: the love, joy, pain, and madness of baseball. But it's really about life. The baseball team are the Durham Bulls (a variation on the title), a minor league North Carolina team who aren't very good.The 3 central characters of the film are Crash Davis, Annie Savoy, and Ebbie Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh, played respectively by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins in a triumvirate of truly focused, convincing, memorable performances. All 3 actors imbibe their characters with humanity and unique qualities. They all pair off at different times in the film and have a variety of memorable interactions and discussions. *ANNIE AND NUKE Annie chooses every season to 'pair up' with one of the players and it comes down to Crash (the catcher) and Nuke (the pitcher). Annie 'chooses' Nuke, but mainly because Crash 'rejects' her. Annie and Nuke share a set of hilarious scenes together. Annie (much older than Nuke) uses him to satisfy her sexual desires and need to stay and feel young and vibrant. Also, she is helping him with his pitching. But there is also a maternal instinct that kicks in. It's obvious that Sarandon (Annie) and Robbins (Nuke) off-screen relationship contributed to their on-screen chemistry.*NUKE AND CRASH Crash is literally traded to the Bulls (engineered by the team manager) so that he can mentor Nuke's pitching, thus preparing him for the major leagues. Crash is a veteran with a lot of experience and advice that Nuke can use, but Nuke doesn't always listen, so Crash has to constantly teach him lessons and reminds him who's boss. Crash and Nuke have a big brother-little brother relationship with Crash doling out advice, but also there is 'sibling' rivalry because of Annie. Crash sees the greatness in Nuke's pitching and is living his dream through Nuke. If Nuke makes it to the majors, he'll know that he made it too. Their last scene together is the most touching moment in the film. Costner and Robbins convey a real, funny, male bonding relationship that is a special part of the film.*CRASH AND ANNIE And, now, to the creme de la creme! The piesta de resistance! The pairing to end all pairings! Crash and Annie! It's always hard to see what is really going on when you first see a film, but when I saw this film 20 years ago, I really kind of knew how it was going to end (with Crash and Annie), but didn't really appreciate at the time how it got there. After watching the film again over the years, I really see the true magic of the Crash/Annie relationship. It's got to be the most fun I've ever had waiting for 2 characters to get together in a film. It's obvious from the beginning, even when she's playing her baseball groupie games, that Annie wants Crash from the start. You can see it in the way she looks at him when she first sees him. It's love at first sight. Of course we find out how she feels later in the film, but it's obvious she wanted him from the start. You can feel the sexual tension and desire in all of Crash and Annie's scenes together, even when they are playing word games and seemingly don't want each other. When they finally do get together, it is one of the rawest, hottest, sexiest series of scenes ever put to the screen, so be warned! Costner and Sarandon (as Crash and Annie) can lay claim to having provided the viewer with the sexiest scenes recorded in film history. The look that they give each other when both finally realize that they have each other is almost as hot as the series of scenes succeeding this. The way that Crash looks at Annie is the way a woman wants a man to look at her when he wants her and the way Annie looks at Crash is the way a man wants a woman to look at him when she wants him (even though the average guy supposedly doesn't really care). But, for Annie, Crash isn't the average guy, not just some seasonal fling who she can forget about later. Crash for her is THE ONE, a man who shares all her interests (reading, philosophy, old music and of course, baseball). And for Crash, Annie is the person he's been waiting for all his life who saves him at just the right time when he's approaching middle age and realizing that he's at a crossroads in his life. She gives him something to live for and continue on. Their final scenes together are truly special. The irony is that, if they had gotten together from the beginning, I don't think they would have ended up together because they needed to learn about and really size up each other to make sure that they were meant to be.Of course, the brilliance of the film is not only these 3 characters, but also the way that it chooses not to glamorize or glorify baseball, but rather let baseball play second fiddle to the real story of the film: life itself. There's a lot of great dialogue and funny scenes with other characters as well. The scene with all the baseball players and coach on the mound talking about 'wedding gifts' is classic! Wonder if this happens in the majors! But a lot of the baseball moments still feel and seem realistic (Crash mentally 'talking' to himself while trying to get a hit off a pesky pitcher, Nuke literally talking to himself while trying not to think so much while pitching, Crash using his veteran savvy as a catcher to throw off batters to get them to strike out). So what is Bull Durham? Well, in order, it's...1)...a love story 2)...about relationships 3)...about mid-life crises 4)...about life itself 5)...about baseball",10,4,9,26 March 2008
Speed," Winning action film from the 90s!
","While I still think the 80s is the seminal decade for action movies, the 90s weren't too shabby, either! For whatever reason, 80s movies stand out more to me over time (not just action movies, but movies in general). As accusatory as people are about the 80s being 'dated', I have a hard time not laughing at some of the absurd, odd apparel and grooming choices of society in the 90s. Thankfully, a good film can overcome these obstacles and not appear dated. This one, SPEED (1994) fits the bill!Starring Keanu Reeves, who in my opinion delivers his greatest film performance, 'Speed' is an 'adrenaline rush' of a movie. The movie starts with an intense, suspenseful sequence of a group of people trapped in an elevator rigged with a bomb set to detonated by it's creator psychopath Howard Payne (played solidly by Dennis Hopper). Enter our film's hero Officer Jack Traven (played by Reeves), a member of the LAPD S.W.A.T. team, along with his partner Harry (winningly played by Jeff Daniel). Harry is the typical snarky sidekick of the film's action hero, but Daniels' reliably goofy personality makes it work. This film actually makes me understand why he was good in 'Dumb and Dumber'! LOL Reeves and Daniels buddy chemistry is believable.After Jack and Harry save the day, Payne is presumed dead in an explosion. A few months pass, and two city buses are rigged to explode. Turns out Payne is very much alive and out to play cat-and- mouse with Jack. Payne detonates the first bus, then tells Jack where the second one is. Jack finds the bus, but the catch is that once it goes over 50mph, it has to stay above that speed or the bomb will detonate, thus the plot of 'Speed'!In a surprising development, one of the bus passengers Annie (wonderfully played by then relative unknown, but now famous Sandra Bullock), who was on her way to work, must take over the wheel and keep the bus above 50mph. Along for the ride are a group of reliable supporting players: Joe Morton as the S.W.A.T team leader and Alan Ruck, Beth Grant, and Carlos Carrasco as part of the group of frustrated and frenetic bus passengers.Interestingly, the film starts off with hostages trapped in an LA high-rise office building, a la 'Die Hard', of which 'Speed' has been called a ripoff in some circles. But 'Speed' still works as it's own entity mainly due to Jack Traven feeling like an original character due to Reeves' strong acting and convincing performance as a cop and action hero, the Jack-Annie dynamic, and even the overall vibe of 'Speed' is more fast-paced than 'Die Hard'. 'Die Hard' is still the seminal action film, but 'Speed' is a great addition to the genre. In particular the stunts are very well-staged, convincingly delivered, and don't feel implausible for the most part. Now, the film definitely has a few minuses. Other than the action, of which there is a lot, much of the non-action scenes are the standard of most action films. While Hopper is very good as the villain of the piece, he's not nearly as memorable as other action movie bad guys, like the ones from the original Lethal Weapon and Die Hard movies. I've also read people say that Bullock steals the film, and I think that's incredibly overstated. Her role isn't as large in this as I initially remembered. While her chemistry with Keanu is palpable, this film is Reeves' movie all the way. While he may be the weaker actor overall of the main cast, in this film, REEVES steals the show! Although Jan De Bont would go onto to direct the extremely cheesy 'Twister' and the awful sequel to this film 'Speed 2', both dubious projects to say the least, he can always hang his hat on 'Speed' as being one of the most intense, engrossing action movie experiences of the 90s, if not of all time.",9,2,4,17 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Exhilarating return to form!
","Let me preface my review by saying that I went into STAR WARS:THE FORCE AWAKENS (2015) 100% KNOWING that it would surpass George Lucas' generally poor prequel trilogy! Sorry, but those movies overall were very lacking in every department: character, dialogue, acting, and even the effects which were over-infested with CGI making them come across as phony. Having seen the original trilogy many times over and this new film TFA a couple of times, it saddens me that the prequels were so empty-headed and empty-hearted. There were a VERY FEW positives in the prequels, but overall they were just plain BAD!With J.J. Abrams taking over the helm of Episode 7, TFA, Star Wars feels like it's old self again! TFA introduces a new set of heroes and villains for fans to attach themselves to and, surprisingly, I already like ALL of the new main characters: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaacs), and Kylo (Adam Driver). Hmmm, let me see, I seem to recall a little summer sci-fi spectacle from 1977 that starred 3 relative unknowns (at the time) Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford that went onto become one of the biggest movie experiences in all of history! It just goes to show you that if you cast the right actors, anything is possible. Ridley, Boyega, Isaacs, and Driver are all excellent in their respective roles, bringing an energy and depth of character that was completely lacking in the prequels.In addition to the 4 newcomers, iconic Harrison Ford has an integral role in TFA as the infamous Han Solo. I've never been the biggest Ford fan and he was never even my favorite Star Wars character, but MAN did Ford bring his all to his reprising of Han Solo in this film! I honestly think Ford in this single movie trumped everything he did as Han Solo in all of the original 3 films combined! He was that engaging, charming, funny, and powerful in his performance. I might need to rethink my belief that Ford has never been that great of an actor and re-visit some of his old work! LOL In addition to the human roles, there are a couple of non-human scene-stealers in the form of newcomer battle droid BB8 (who manages to carry the robot load that usually goes to R2D2 and C3PO in the earlier films) and old faithful Chewbacca (played again by Peter Mayhew) who, similar to Han, somehow trumps everything he did in the original movies. Also, Carrie Fisher successfully fits snugly back into her role as the wise, tough, resilient, but her more world- weary Leia Organa. I was so happy that every actor brought it to this movie. The uniformly great performances astounded me and made me proud!Abrams injected this excellent offering into the Star Wars collection with a lot of humorous dialogue, just the right doses of seriousness, great action sequences, and an energy that rivaled the '77 classic. I would note that the main reason I'm not giving it 10 stars is because the villains Snoke, General Hux, and Phasma were a bit too cliché and 1-dimensional. I'm hoping that will improve in the sequels, which I can't wait for!The general plot of TFA follows the adventures of Finn (Boyega in an energetic, hilarious performance), a disgruntled Stormtrooper who runs into a captive Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Isaacs making the most of his limited screen time) on the 'Death Star' like Starkiller base. Poe has been taken captive by the mysterious Sith Lord Kylo Ren (Driver in a subtle, complex performance), who is trying to procure a map of the star system (which Poe hid in his battle droid BB8) that will lead to the location of the legendary Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, who has gone missing. Upon escape, Finn and Poe crash land on the desert planet Jakku, where they get separated and Finn meets inhabitant Rey (Ridley in a superb, persuasive, engaging performance), who has already made contact with BB8, and the 2 work together to try to get the droid to the Resistance.Rey is in essence the film's main character as she takes over the 'Luke Skywalker' role of the movie, the young, starry-eyed girl lusting for a life of adventure, but feeling held back by ties to her home planet, with Jakku is being very reminiscent of Luke's home world of Tatooine. Ridley is utterly fantastic in this role and I loved her character throughout. Luke's journey in the original films was the main draw for me, so I'm glad that Rey is going to be the hero(ine) that I can root for and follow in the new films. Ridley and Boyega have terrific chemistry, as do Boyega and Isaacs. These actors have already got me hooked on the 'awakening' of the Force!Abrams, similar to what he did with the Star Trek reboots, brings an energy and humor to the film that was much needed to get the franchise back to it's popular roots. The action sequences are exhilarating and the characterizations are provocative. NOTHING will replace or approach the movie-going magic of the original trilogy, but The Force Awakens is definitely a step (back) to the right direction!",9,18,36,21 December 2015
Final Destination," Makes you think!
","FINAL DESTINATION was a pleasantly surprising flick when I first saw it not long after it came out and it still keeps me interested. Of course, you'd think a film with horrific deaths and populated mostly by teenagers would be a mindless slasher flick, but this is, frankly, not. The film draws you in immediately as it postulates that 'Death' has a plan. It gives clues to the the film's protagonist Alex Browning (excellently played by Devon Sawa) at the outset. Alex is scheduled to go on Flight 180 to France on a trip with his fellow senior students and their chaperones, including Miss Lewton (effective Kristen Cloke of SPACE:ABOVE AND BEYOND).Fellow students include the shy Clear (sexy Ali Larter of HEROES). Clear is an orphan whose parents died in a tragic accident and she has a strange emotional connection to Alex, even though they had never spoken before the trip. Also there is the abrasive Carter (menacing Kerr Smith of DAWSON'S CREEK), Alex's best friend Tod (Chad Donella), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), and the goofy Billy (comic relief Sean William Scott of American PIE fame).Alex has a premonition that the flight will crash and in the ensuing melee and confusion, Alex, Miss Lewton, Clear, Carter, Tod, Terry, and Billy all end up off the plane and have to take a later flight. When the plane does indeed explode and crash, everyone realizes that Alex was right! What's really interesting is that Alex is not really looked upon as a hero, but rather as a spooky freak! There are varying levels of relief, curiosity, and fear exuded by all the characters after this incident and it is the fact that the plot went in this direction that makes FINAL DESTINATION a rather fascinating film.In the ensuing months, each character, still spooked out by the crash, avoids Alex, except for Clear, who is drawn to him in an almost psychic way. I find Alex and Clear coming together rather touching and it is not done in a predictable, maudlin way. They simply have a strong bond, a connection. One by one, the plane survivors begin to die rather gruesome, mysterious deaths as 'Death' indeed does seem to have intended them to die, so Alex sets out to try to cheat 'Death'! That's what is really scary about this film: Instead of the killer being a physical being, it is 'Death' itself! How do you control it? How do you stop the ultimate killer? While this film could have devolved into parody or inanity, it never does. The dialogue is very good and the performances uniformly exceptional. Character actors Daniel Roebuck and Roger Smith (as federal agents investigating the mysterious crash and Alex's story) also do a fine job of making the film work. Veteran actor Tony Todd (CANDYMAN) also deserves praise for his spooky performance as a caretaker that Alex and Clear go to for help on how to cheat death. A very provocative film.",8,0,1,29 August 2009
The Purge," Underrated social commentary
","Having seen THE PURGE (2013) several times, I've come to the conclusion that it's an unfairly maligned, underrated, socially conscious film. Not just another run-of-the-mill suspense thriller, 'The Purge' actually makes some persuasive statements and arguments for and against the fictional annual national 'cleansing'.Highlighting the film is James Sandin (superbly played by strong veteran actor Ethan Hawke), a prominent corporate employee of the security firm that provides the protection systems for he and his neighbors. These systems are needed for the recently enacted annual U.S. 'Purge', a 12-hour period of cleansing where citizens are allowed to commit virtually any crime they want against virtually anyone they please. Only high-ranking government officials (the ones who came up with the idea, the irony) are immune for the criminal activity. Sandin's family includes his wife Mary (excellently played by the reliable Lena Headey) and two kids Zoey and Charlie (solid work by Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder). The Sandins' strained family life is subtly displayed in the hours prior to the purge, as Zoey in particular is a rebellious type who against James' wishes is dating a boy quite older than her. Also, we meet the Sandins' neighbors, the main one being Grace (played in a pitch perfect performance by Arija Bareikis), the de facto hypocritical, nosy 'Gladys Kravitz' of the neighborhood. The undercurrent of false community is subtly established early on.And so the purge begins! The scene of the family silently watching the national broadcast of the start of the purge is very effective. Soon after it starts, a Stranger (brilliantly played by Edwin Hodge in a strong, silent role) runs through the neighborhood screaming for help, as Charlie de-activates the home security system to let him in, then all hell breaks loose! A psychotic young man, the Polite Leader (played to creepy perfection by Rhys Wakefield) trespasses on Sandin property imploring them to give over the Stranger to he and his crew of young purgers. There's a strong undercurrent of racism and targeting that permeates as the Stranger is a homeless, black man.During the course of the battle of wills between the Sandins and the Purgers, strong social commentary shines through as the family has the moral dilemma whether to give over the Stranger to protect their home and family, yet by giving him over, they violate their moral beliefs in being humane people. The internal and external struggle among the family members, especially between James and Mary, really provides the heart of the film. The ending scenes are very powerful and by the end of it, a strong statement about the society we live in is made. Don't believe the haters. This one is much better than given credit for!",9,0,1,31 May 2015
Munich," Perhaps Spielberg's most fully realized human film
","Interesting that with all the hype for MINORITY REPORT and AI, Spielberg's true masterpiece of the 2000s may just be this film MUNICH. MUNICH is perhaps that only film that Spielberg has directed that doesn't manipulate the viewer in some way and tries to take sides. In that sense, it's the most human film that he's ever done. It displays all characters, whether the 'good guy' Israeli Mossad agents, or the 'bad guy' terrorists that took part in the 1972 assassinations of the Israeli Olympians that are the agents' prey, as multi-dimensional, with beliefs, feelings, and humanity. The deaths in these films are as realistic as anything you'll see on film. No glamorizing, no over-the-top special effects. So you come away from it feeling bad for the victims, even though they perpetrated a horrific crime.MUNICH stars newcomer Eric Bana in a great performance (how he didn't get a Best Actor nod is beyond me) as Mossad agent Avner, who leads a group tasked by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to assassinate the Palestinian terrorists who killed members of Israeli Olympic team. Included in this team are Steve and Ephraim (played by the fine actors Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush). These men are surprisingly plain, down-to-earth people with families and many interests, not the cold-blooded assassins that you would expect. They actually sit down with each other regularly to have meals together (Avner is an excellent cook) and converse about their personal lives. This part truly humanizes them to the viewer and makes the terror all the more real b/c it's hard to imagine these men as killers, so when we see them do it, we are mortified.Being a true story based on horrific events, MUNICH is surprisingly not boring or downbeat. The characters are so interesting, vivid, and multi-faceted that you stay glued to the screen. It's almost amazing that this is a film directed by Steven Spielberg, who I greatly admire, because there is no sentimentality, manipulation, or heavy-handedness whatsoever. Even in some of his best works, that has been the case, but not here, which belongs among his best. The ending is truly not a Spielberg ending that you would expect. I think that MUNICH is the film where we really see a different side of Spielberg, not SCHINDLER'S LIST or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.After seeing MUNICH, I really wonder how it did not take home the Best Picture prize of 2005 or director for Spielberg. I don't care that Spielberg had already won 2 directing Oscars. This should have been his 3rd.",10,0,0,14 July 2008
Pitch Perfect," Refreshing and entertaining 'musical' comedy
","PITCH PERFECT (2012) is a surprisingly clever comedy about, of all things, the world of collegiate acapella groups! I guess Hollywood has covered virtually every competitive arena out there, so this one might as well join the ranks. Starring up-and-comer Anna Kendrick (already an Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress for 'Up in the Air' and also one of the co-stars in those insanely popular 'Twilight' movies), Kendrick takes on the lead role this time and does an excellent job carrying this flick. Kendrick has great comic timing and manages to lift the sometimes predictable, yet generally witty, script to another level.Kendrick is by no means the only plus of this film, though! The supporting cast is wonderful . Skylar Astin (Jesse), Brittany Snow (Chloe), Anna Camp (Aubrey), Alexis Knapp (Stacie), Ben Platt (Benji), Ester Dean (Cynthia Rose), Hana Mae Lee (Lilly), Adam DeVine (Bumper), and ESPECIALLY scene-stealer Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) all deliver the goods and they really help make this movie from degenerating into a cliché vehicle, all really bringing their characters to life. Wilson in particular as Fat Amy had me in stitches for the entire film! Although the main plot has been done a million times(rebellious outsider must overcome obstacles and personal issues to fit in and bond in a new environment and lead group of acapella misfits into a final showdown against the abrasive, cocky acapella group), I found myself enjoying the journey of these group of ladies thanks to (1) a refreshingly funny script (2) a collection of great songs and mash-ups and (3) the sweet, believable love story of Beca and Jesse.The plot centers around the Barden University 'Bellas', an all-female acapella group that was embarrassed at the prior year's nationals (film's opening scene). The Bellas are eternal lapdogs to the Barden 'Treblemakers', a group of uber-talented aca-nerds who won the championship. The Bellas leader is the extremely uptight and frigid Aubrey (Camp), who along with the more friendly and effervescent Chloe (Snow), must recruit a whole new squad since the rest either graduated or quit after the nationals embarrassment. As the Bellas leaders, Snow and Camp have a wonderful, mature 'Mean Girls' rapport with each other. The potential aca-recruits (for the Bellas, Trebles, and two other campus acapella groups) must sing 'Since You've Been Gone' in a hilarious audition scene. Among the new Bellas are the rebellious Beca (Kendrick), the loopy and caustic Fat Amy (Wilson), slutty Stacie (Knapp), the uber-quiet Lilly (Lee), and powerhouse singer Cynthia Rose (Dean). Special mention should go to 'other 3' Bellas Jessica (played by Kelley Jakle), Denise (played by Wanetah Walmsley), and Ashley (played by Shelley Regner), as they, along with Lilly, do a lot of the non-verbal sounds required of an acapella group to mimic musical instruments.Jesse (played with utter charm and sublime confidence by Astin) gets recruited by the Treblemakers, of course, and a 'taboo' romance (Bellas and Trebles don't mix!) between he and Beca forms during the course of the school year. I really enjoyed the sweet Beca-Jesse pairing. It was a refreshing change-of-pace as they bonded through their love of music (Jessie wants to be a film scorer and Beca a DJ) and actually had an 'old-fashioned' courtship, on a college campus no less where sex is probably rampant! Kendrick and Astin had a natural underplayed chemistry that flows, giving the film it's heart.What's stunning about this movie is that virtually all of the main cast are not professional singers or dancers, yet you couldn't tell by watching the film! Whatever training they had to endure in the making of the movie, EVERY actor actually translates to the screen as having musical and dance talent. While it's obvious that Astin and Dean are natural and experienced singers, stunningly, actors like Kendrick, Snow, and Wilson held their own and really sounded great, as well.My favorite scenes included the aforementioned audition scene, the 'riff-off' scene where different acapella groups strung off a sequence of diverse songs, the 'Just the Way You Are/Just a Dream' mash-up scene, the 'Party in the USA' bus scene, the Trebles nationals performance, and the climactic 'payoff' scene of the Bellas final routine at nationals, an energetic, sexy, uplifting performance of mashed-up songs, with one particular song that symbolizes the Beca-Jesse relationship.Although the musical performances are great, I actually think Pitch Perfect excels in the comedy department as well, and I wouldn't enjoy this film nearly as much if it weren't so funny. Amazingly, I think the film manages to avoid a lot of clichés that one would expect, and even though the climax is predictable, it's the getting there that surprised me. Examples are: (1) the 'nerds' of the movie, the Trebles, were pretty proud of their nerdiness and actually make fun of the 'cool' types and didn't get bullied as one would expect in such a movie, (2) the Bellas were accepting of each other's uniqueness; there was tension, but mostly due to the pressure of competition; they all actually LIKED each other; there was no 'evil' versus 'good'; Aubrey and Beca had believable conflict with each other; Aubrey was controlling and stern, but not in a mean-spirited way; she was under immense pressure and felt threatened by Beca, while Beca was nonconformist and cool, but too much of a loner; there were shades of gray, and (3) in the end, it wasn't about Bellas versus Trebles or winning, but about compromise, teamwork, friendship, and love. I know it's cliché, but comedy ain't easy! Director Jason Moore does an excellent job with this musical-comic keeper!",9,6,12,17 February 2013
Heat," Decent effort by Mann, but frankly not nearly one of his best!
","HEAT (1995), while an ambitious, competent offering in the Michael Mann collection of films, I frankly feel like it's very overrated. A daring undertaking by Mann, an epic crime drama clocking in at over 2.5 hours, populated by a large and diverse cast, it is a by-the-numbers tale of police procedure and high-level criminals, and starring acting legends Al Pacino (as robbery-homicide Lt Vincent Hanna) and Robert DeNiro (as master thief Neil MacCauley). Frankly, I kind of think that this is one of Pacino's weaker acting efforts. And around this time (mid 90s) he was nailing every role in sight, just coming off of winning the Best Actor Oscar in 1992 for Scent of a Woman, giving one of his best performances in 1993 for Carlito's Way, for which he SHOULD HAVE been nominated Best Actor, and delivering a magnetic performance in 1994 for The Devil's Advocate. But Pacino seems very bored here, like he can't get a handle on this role of Hanna. Maybe it's because he was drained by this point. Pacino's dialog alternates between choppy monotone sentences and annoying rants that I feel detract from the film. While I don't think that his performance is all that great either, DeNiro really doesn't fare much better in his low-key role of criminal MacCauley, underplaying it to the extreme, perhaps attributable to the fact that his character has to display a lack of emotion because he can't establish connections and his level of maturity in relation to his younger cohorts. So Pacino overacts and DeNiro underacts...2 huge negatives for this film!Ironically, while Pacino as the lead cop kind of mails it in, I was very impressed with the work of the actors on his team of cops played by Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson, and Ted Levine, who sublimely essayed the roles of dedicated, overworked robbery-homicide detectives. Interestingly, I have the opposite feeling about DeNiro's criminal team. I thought the actors playing his team (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Danny Trejo) were kind of lifeless, actually underplaying their roles even more then DeNiro did. Most of the female characters are a aren't very good either, all pretty indistinguishable, other than the standard Hollywood trick of making each one a little different: Diane Venora (as Pacino's wife) plays the worrisome cop wife, Ashley Judd (as Kilmer's wife) plays the bitchy criminal's wife, and Amy Brenneman (as DeNiro's flame) plays the innocent young oblivious girlfriend. They were all much too mannered in their performances, just surface roles. Interesetingly, the best female performance came from the (then) teen-aged Natalie Portman, who really showed some early acting chops as Pacino's troubled stepdaughter. Portman really outshined many of her adult acting peers in this film.I thought some of the minor roles were much better written and more notable, namely Kevin Gage (as the psychotic Waingro, who screws up the initial heist and ends up on Neil's hit list), William Fichtner (as a shady high-level businessman who double crosses Neil) and Dennis Haysbert (as a frustrated parolee who joins Neil's gang last minute). I wasn't very enamored of Jon Voight's turn as a disabled retired criminal who was giving Neil the plans for his various jobs either. Again, another rather too-mannered, monotonous performance. Unfortunately, most of the characterizations lacked a certain amount of depth that really could have made this film better. The characters in general leave me cold. The film is so low-key that when the major dramatic moments happen, I don't feel as invested as I should.A major complaint I have about this movie is that at around the 1- hour point, Hanna's team have the drop on Neil's gang as they are performing surveillance on them about to pull a major job, but Neil can tell he's been made and tells his team that they are walking. Hanna opts to let them go because they'd get only misdemeanor charges, thus the need for the film to go on for another close to 2 hours! The thing is that the film started with the gang pulling a major job where they robbed a federal bank truck and KILLED 3 armed guards! And Hanna knew they were behind it. So why couldn't they nail them on that after they arrested them, for armed robbery and attempted murder! You have to WAIT for them to pull another job and catch them in the act with innocent people involved? Major plothole. Another is that late in the film, Kilmer's character basically gets away on a rather absurd plot point. The cops had already known what every member of Neil's gang LOOKED LIKE as they had police records on all of them. When the cops stopped Kilmer on the street to verify his identity, why didn't they have an actual PHOTO to see if it was him and not just go by fake IDs and driver's license? Pretty thin.Of course, being a Mann film, it has a cool look and atmosphere and the robbery scenes are very tense and involving. The big shootout at about the two-thirds into the film is definitely a keeper. Also, I actually think the lack of a true score and music give the film a more realistic edge. Plus, the action scenes generally ring true as realistic as cars don't just explode randomly like they do in most action movies. But it's really hard to get into any of the army of characterizations that really stretch and thin the movie out to being an overlong, somewhat self-indulgent essay on cops versus criminals. Commendable effort by Mann, just not one of his best!",5,0,3,21 April 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Awesomeness!
","I so badly wish that I could say that the original STAR WARS:EPISODE IV,A NEW HOPE(ANH) was the best of the STAR WARS films, but it is, frankly, not! That honor goes to STAR WARS:EPISODE V,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (ESB)(1980). ESB is that rare sequel that manages to top it's predecessor. Make no mistake, though, ANH is still as magical, pure, and fun a flick as it was in 1977 when I first saw it as a kid! But ESB ups the ante and succeeds in it's own depiction of the Star Wars universe. In reality, ESB is in basic tone the antithesis of ANH, which is a big reason why I think that BOTH films stand the test of time! If your in the mood for a fast-paced, imaginative adrenaline-rush of pure action-adventure, then pop in ANH! But if you want imagination combined with character depth and detail, mystery, mood, and atmosphere, then ESB is more your cup of tea! Mark Hamill (reprising the role that made him famous, Luke Skywalker) gets to show some acting chops in ESB, but he doesn't do a complete character 180, thankfully! Hamill still imbibes Luke with the same youthful vigor and eagerness, but with just a touch of more maturity as Luke is now a Jedi-in-training, preparing to take on the despicable Darth Vader (the iconic character created from the original, voiced by James Earl Jones and played by David Prowse). While in ANH, Vader had a smaller role (just force-choking snotty imperial officers and looking intimidating), here in ESB, Vader is a major player and more fleshed out and much scarier as he exudes menace and fear throughout the film.On the planet Dagobah with his trusty sidekick, the all-purpose droid R2D2, Luke's training in the arts of the Jedi Knights is led by, IMHO, the greatest character of ALL Star Wars films...drum roll, please?!....Master YODA! A brilliant puppet creation, created by Muppets creator Jim Henson and voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda has more personality and depth than most human characters I've ever seen in film! While Obi-Wan Kenobi (reprised by Sir Alec Guiness in a cameo role as a Force Ghost) laid the foundation for the Force in ANH, Yoda builds the house in ESB! Whatever this mystical 'Force' is, Yoda makes you believe! My favorite scenes in ESB are between Luke and Yoda, on a swamp planet no less! Also returning are Harrison Ford (as the dashing rascal pilot Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (as the feisty, forward Princess Leia). Navigating their way through asteroids and space monsters along with Han's Wookie sidekick Chewbacca and hilarious protocol droid C3P0, Han and Leia's story is told in parallel to Luke's as they all must go their separate ways to escape the wrath of the Empire until they can re-join the Rebel fleet. Ford and Fisher's natural chemistry shines through in ESB as Han and Leia bring out the best (and sometimes worst!) in each other in an enjoyable love-hate pairing.Surprising cast addition Billy Dee Williams also gives a convincing performance as Lando Calrissian, Han's old friend and leader of Cloud City Bespin, where Han and Leia seek temporary refuge from the Empire.While slower in storytelling and darker than it's predecessor, ESB still manages to entertain with a wonderful script, excellent acting, a provocative plot, and great action sequences, including the opening battle on the ice-planet Hoth, the asteroid scene, and concluding with an awesome light-saber showdown (probably the best in all the films) between Luke and Vader on Bespin. Given that it was made 30+ years ago, the special effects in ESB are still eye-popping and quite impressive. Interesting is that, George Lucas, the 'name' most associated with Star Wars, has very little to do with the result of this great film. It was directed by Irvin Kershner, written by Lawrence Kasdan, and scored by of course John Williams. Much more than a Star Wars film, ESB is a film classic!",10,1,2,29 March 2011
The Breakfast Club," One of my favorite 80s movies
","The way I judge the true quality and greatness of a movie is if I still find it as or more enjoyable today as I did when I first saw it. The Breakfast Club falls into that category. There's a reason that Entertainment Weekly listed this as the NUMBER ONE teenage movie of all time. I just saw this movie again a week ago, and was just as into it as I was in 1985. While it obviously has the dated 80s look in some of the characters (that's the way they looked back then; they can't help it) and music, the core theme of the film still resonates today.It's about a group of disjointed, confused, and outcast youths who, in one way or another, are trapped by the circumstances of their schoolhouse cliques, family lives, and by themselves. But on one Saturday morning and afternoon while they are all in detention, all of their fears, secrets, and inner demons are revealed to each other, sometimes on purpose, sometimes not. Andy, John, Claire, Brian, and Allison all come reluctantly together and find they are not as different as they all thought on this Saturday, which represents a turning point in all their lives.The cast is perfection. Five actors who were members of 'The Brat Pack' star in this movie: Emilio Estevez (Andy), Judd Nelson (John), Molly Ringwald (Claire), Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), and Ally Sheedy (Allison). Their various interactions are completely realistic, powerful, and poignant. And the two couples that pair off near the end are perfectly chosen. Of course there has to be an odd man out (and we all know who that is). What's amazing is that although some of these actors had worked together before and they were all friends in real life, they completely pull it off that their characters are essentially complete strangers (except for Andy and Claire, who travel in some of the same popular circles). All the performances still hold up today. That's a big reason the movie is still very good.Additionally, Paul Gleason (as Principal Vernon), who has to oversee the 5 misfits' detention and John Kapelos (as Carl the Janitor) are perfectly cast. The scene where Nelson's rebellious John Bender and Gleason's authoritarian Vernon go back and forth may be the best scene in the movie. And Carl the Janitor's 'big' scene where he speechifies about knowing all their secrets is hilarious.Make no mistake, even though this is easily classified as a 'teen' movie, there are some real powerful moments in it: the Bender-Vernon face-off, Andy's speech about what he did to get in detention and how remorseful he was about it (the long, tracking shot of just seeing Andy and no one else for a while added power to this moment), and Brian's all-too-real admission of why he got sent to detention (a real scary moment, this one hit me the hardest b/c I can relate to how he felt).All in all, an extremely well done film that still holds up amazingly well today.",10,0,1,9 March 2008
Donnie Darko," Top 10 of the 2000s!
","I almost forgot about this film! Maybe because it came out at the beginning of the decade, or maybe because it doesn't have a real big name cast and is populated with a healthy assortment of newcomers, or maybe because it is perhaps one of the WEIRDEST films that I've ever seen! A lot of maybes. But there is one definite. DONNIE DARKO (2001) is an incredibly involving, often hilarious, and monumentally provocative film. I saw it not long after it came out due to it's instant cult status. I really enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but because it was the early part of the decade, I didn't figure that this would be one of the films that would end up being the BEST of the decade. Now, when I think back, this film is EASILY among my personal top 10.DONNIE DARKO stars newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal (in a sorely underrated and brilliant performance). Gyllenhaal is the titular star and gives one of the most complex, thought-provoking performances of the decade. In retrospect, he should have been nominated for Best Actor. He carries the film as good (better I say) than many older, established actors have carried more acclaimed, awarded works in the decade. A very realistic portrayal of a 'schizophrenic' personality.Donnie is a disturbed, suburbanite high-schooler in the mid-1980s and at the film's outset, survives a plane engine crashing into his bedroom as he was out sleepwalking during one of his schizo episodes. The FAA has no idea where the plane part emanated from. A strange 'bunny' named Frank acts as his guide throughout the film, telling Donnie that in 30 days, the world is going to end. During this 30 days, while in total awake mode, in addition to Frank, Donnie starts seeing these creepy watery-looking visions that come out of people. Also, there is this cooky old lady, Grandma Death, who wrote a book about time travel, that lives on the outskirts of town that is a key figure in the proceedings. Donnie investigates and finds that time travel may be a possibility.There is actually debate about what is going on during this strange month that Donnie experiences (1) Is it an alternate universe that has opened up due to the plane engine creating and travelling through a rift in time? (2) Is it Donnie's hallucination? (3) Is it a vision that bunny Frank is showing Donnie of what 'would have happened' had he not returned to his bed and gone back to sleep? I also think that the conclusions of what would have happened are ambiguous as well. Will it really have been the end of the world if Donnie hadn't done the heroic thing? Or would it just mean that the world would have branched off into an alternate reality? Or was all of this just one of Donnie's hallucinations that he had during that night? Of course, at first viewing, I just thought the whole thing was weird. Upon repeat, thought, I understand it a lot more. Even without a total grip on the sci-fi aspects of DONNIE DARKO, the film is filled with many universal, human truths. If anything, DONNIE DARKO is a life lesson and a journey more than a sci-fi film. Donnie is so evolved from his peers (and even his parents and teachers) that he seems like an otherworldy being at times. This is part of the film's magic and charm. Donnie is almost 'godlike' with a sense of himself and the world.The excellent supporting cast includes newcomer Jena Malone as Donnie's girlfriend, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sis) and Daveigh Chase as his sisters, ERs Noah Wyle (in a terrific, understated role as Donnie's science teacher), Drew Barrymore as his English teacher, veteran Katharine Ross as his pyschiatrist, Beth Grant in a wonderfully hilarious performance as Donnie's gym teacher Mrs. Farmer, and last but not least the late Patrick Swayze in a revelatory performance as motivational speaker Jim Cunningham. I also think that Grant and Swayze should have received Supporting nominations for their work in this film.The ending of DONNIE DARKO packs one of the biggest emotional punches I've ever experienced in a film. By the time I was done watching it, I felt I was on a higher plane, right up there with Donnie Darko!",10,1,3,22 January 2010
Born on the Fourth of July," One of Stone and Cruise's best
","I recall first watching BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY when it first came out in 1989 (back during a time when I frankly watched too many movies). They had done Vietnam movies to death at this point (DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, FULL METAL JACKET, BOYS OF COMPANY C, HAMBURGER HILL). All those prior films, except for COMING HOME and DEER HUNTER in parts are about the actual Vietnam experience, whereas BORN is virtually about the effects on the soldier upon returning home. You'd think that by the time of BORN (1989), a film about anything related to Vietnam would seem like retread. Thankfully, due to Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise, it is anything but that. An amazingly involving film that stands out amongst the great Vietnam films, BORN quite possibly cracks the top 5 Vietnam movies! It catches your attention from the opening when our hero Ron Kovic (portrayed brilliantly by Mr. Cruise) briefly narrates how he came to be infatuated with war and his country as a boy. Such an innocent scene of little Ronny playing 'war' with his friends on his birthday, the 4th of July. Then sitting on his father's back during the 4th of July parade and admiring the veteran soldiers passing by. Soon after we see a teenage Ron working in the grocery store afterschool with all the enthusiasm and energy a young teen should have. Amazing that at this point in his career (I think Cruise was actually in his late 20s) that he could so perfectly make us believe him as a teen! Then Ron enlists in the Marines and goes off to Vietnam to be badly wounded (permanent paralysis). The brief Vietnam scenes are incredibly authentic and the VA hospital scenes are some of the most disgusting and gruesome ever filmed. Ron and other vets are treated like utter crap by the VA employees and he has to endure this treatment while being devastated that he has lost permanent use of his legs. Ron returns home and THIS scene that occurs around the midway point of the film is the one that I most remember. Watching this once energetic, full-of-life young man now permanently disabled and having to return to his family in this condition chokes me up to this day, especially that brief moment with his mother. As time passes, Ron realizes that his idealism may have been misplaced and that war, in particular this war, may not have been the right one to fight. His own family turns against him, the very ones who encouraged him in the first place...Sad...So Ron leaves and moves to Mexico to get away from his troubles and hooks up with similar vets who live a life of booze and sexual pleasure (as best these men could experience). He soon realizes that these people are no more his friends than perfect strangers and that he must battle and defeat his inner demons to become a complete man again.I'm not a big fan of biopics, but Stone's film seems to capture the essence of the pre, during, and post Vietnam experience from one brave, great man's viewpoint, but never devolves into pontification or tedium. And frankly, generally films like this can easily become tedious. The cinematography, sound, and editing is brilliant. Mostly, the film benefits from Mr. Cruise, a truly GREAT actor who proved that he could play with the big boys! Really, one of the best portrayals of a real-life person in film ever!",10,1,3,26 July 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Cheesy, tedious retread of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'
","Still wondering how this movie, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) is so revered in the Indiana Jones 'trilogy'. Yeah, I'm not counting Crystal Skull, but not for the reasons people think. It's just that it's painfully obvious that Skull was probably never meant to be made and that it was supposed to all end in 1989 with this movie. There are actually things I like about Skull, but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly, 'childish' sequence of a Young Indiana Jones (essayed by River Phoenix, who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford) on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah, who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types, and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies, but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle, giving up the artifact to the bad guys, but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting, 1939, where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star (just like in the original film). Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail, so Indy goes on a trek across the globe (just like in the original film), which encompasses Italy, Germany, and Israel, in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting), who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See, these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word 'Nazi' sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also, there is the required female sidekick. Of course, it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie, but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen half-naked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND, back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father, because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like 'Highlander', because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery, but not in this movie. He is in no way, shape, or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his co-stars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny, their dialog composed of endless, annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing, but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies, whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now, I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick, but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives, and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair, but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!",1,17,34,4 July 2014
Back to the Future," The best film of 1985
","BACK TO THE FUTURE is the rarest of movies. It has every element imaginable in it and going for it: science fiction, fantasy, humor, action, thrills, family ties (pun intended!), and an assortment of great, oddball characters. Michael J. Fox (in his greatest accomplishment as an actor) is Marty McFly, a 1985 Hill Valley guitar-playing high-schooler who aspires to be a rock 'n roll star. He is the youngest child of working-class parents George and Lorraine McFly (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson in their best roles). George is working a dead-end job for his mean boss and high-school rival Biff (perfectly cast Thomas F. Wilson). George never realized his dream of being a science-fiction author due to primarily a lack of confidence and Marty doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Marty also has a super hot girlfriend Jennifer (sexy Claudia Wells; I liked her much better than Elisabeth Shue in the sequels in the same role). And finally, last but not least, Marty has a mentor Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (embodied by the great Christopher Lloyd in a performance that should have won him an Academy Award).Doc is a genius yet oddball scientist (what scientist isn't a little quirky?) builds a time machine composed of a DeLorean (remember that car? the Edsel of the 80s) and then the fun begins. At the town mall one night, Doc and Marty test out his time machine on Doc's dog Einstein and then Marty mistakenly (won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie) is transported back to 1955 in the machine and must figure a way to return home. But Marty screws up along the way to finding the young 1955 version of Doc and sets the process in motion that keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love, thereby endangering his very existence. So he and Doc have dual missions: to make his parents meet and fall in love and to fix the machine (damaged during the time travel) and get Marty, as Doc would say 'back to the future!' This is my favorite film of director Robert Zemeckis. WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and FORREST GUMP were both overrated and don't have that 're-watchability factor' that BTTF has, even though both films garnered perhaps more critical praise and acclaim in their time. But BTTF is complete, utter, enjoyable fun from beginning to end. I still find myself today being impressed by the way Michael J. Fox convincingly carried this film, at Crispin Glover's manic, hilarious, comic acting style, at how sexy Lea Thompson was in this film, and finally, at Christopher Lloyd's brilliant characterization of Doc Brown. But more impressive is the fact that even though I've seen the film a lot of times, I'm still excited by several of it's signature scenes: young Biff and his gang chasing down a skateboarding Marty, Marty's wonderful rendition of 'Johnny Be Good' at the Enchantment-Under-The-Sea dance, and of course the pulse-pounding, thrilling climax of Marty and Doc trying to put history back in order and send Marty back to the future. It's strange that there really has been no film like this since it came out in 1985. Maybe too difficult to re-create the magic of this one. There have been a lot of time travel films, but I believe this may be the best one in all of film history! Forget about the unequal sequels. This film is the standard by which all fantasy (and time travel) films of the modern era should be measured.",10,1,1,23 March 2008
Goodfellas," Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci! Together again.
","GOODFELLAS came out in the first year of the 90s and was so good it stayed one of the best films by the end of the decade. It is a supremely confident Martin Scorsese at his storytelling best! It is perhaps his last true masterpiece (so far). GOODFELLAS is the anti-gangster film. The anti-GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS tells the sordid, sleazy side of the gangster. It is realistic in presentation, but still has that Scorcese touch of flair and the characters jump out at the screen at you.GOODFELLAS is the story of one Henry Hill (played memorably by Ray Liotta, who also narrates most of the film). Henry was raised in Brooklyn in the 50s and ended up friends with a local hood Tommy DeVito, who was connected to the mob. As an adult Tommy is played by Joe Pesci in a performance that deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor award of 1990. Pesci's speech was short but memorable (the Academy really deserves few words of thanks from anyone, but this time, they got the winner right). Tommy is a borderline psychopath who snaps at the slightest hint of disrespect towards him. These moments are simultaneously hilarious and frightening to watch, because they seem so real and Pesci perfectly relays the hotheadedness of Tommy.Tommy works for the larger mob, run by Paulie Cicero (a well cast Paul Sorvino in fine form). The go-to guy though for both Henry and Tommy is Paulie's right hand man Jimmy Conway (played by the great Robert DeNiro in one of his most underrated performances). DeNiro really carries GOODFELLAS for me. Scorcese ALWAYS seems to bring out the best in DeNiro. He really seems to know what makes this actor tick. And it works to perfection in GOODFELLAS.Together, the triumvirate of Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy successfully gangster-ize their way through the 50s, 60s, and 70s (well, 2 of them made it that far!). The convos in GOODFELLAS are what really strike me. They seem so authentic and scary. These guys plot, scheme, cajole, and kill with such alarming ease that it is almost a revelation that guys like this really existed. They are completely embedded in this world. They love being GOODFELLAS.Also memorable is Best Supporting Actress nominee Lorraine Bracco as Henry's wife Karen, who gets narrate a small part of the film herself. Initially disgusted by Henry and his world, Karen becomes intoxicated by it and caught in it herself. The biggest star of GOODFELLAS is probably the cinematography: long tracking shots, character closeups at key moments, zoom-ins to characters at important points, slightly shaky camera action, etc. It magnifies the effect of this deadly life that these people have chosen to be a part of. The use of era music is done to great effect as well, in addition to capturing the essence of the 50s through the 70s. Great work all around.GOODFELLAS was nominated for Best Picture in 1990 and should have won. Scorsese absolutely should have won Best Director. A real modern classic. Heck, a classic in any time period!",10,0,0,17 August 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," INFERIOR sequel to THE BOURNE IDENTITY...And that's a FACT!
","What is this current obsession that sequels are automatically superior to the originals nowadays? If film history has shown us ONE thing, this is RARELY the case! When THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (2004) first came out, I kept reading and hearing how it surpassed its exciting, vivid predecessor THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002). Frankly, it does not. The biggest complaint...SHAKY CAM! With all the constant hand-held camera-motion, the viewer can't discern any of the action or acting for that matter! Films now think they have to resort to gimmickry and overcomplicated storytelling to even be considered great.THE BOURNE IDENTITY kept the plot beautifully simple: likable amnesiac protagonist (brought to life by Matt Damon, here again playing Jason Bourne) found by Greek fisherman goes on a quest to find out who he is and what he does; and even though his story was convoluted, the filmmaker (Doug Liman) kept it to the basics: love interest, lean action sequences, pulse-pounding music, minimal number of key characters, totally satisfying ending! What does the director (Paul Greengrass) of this sequel do? What every sequel TRIES to do: 1) Up the ante by exponentially increasing the cast! In BI, we had one main 'villain' brilliantly driving the action, Chris Cooper's cold, action-oriented determined CIA boss; in BS (perfect initials!), we are forced to watch a poorly cast Joan Allen as stagnant Pamela Landy, who just stands in a computer room barking at her superiors and inferiors and patsy Brian Cox (CIA Chief Abbott back from the original) with an expanded role here to just meat up the story and provide a fall guy.2) Overcomplicating the plot! Get all extra serious with Bourne recalling some random empty backstory where he killed this girl's parents. They explored this already in BI when Bourne recalled his aborted attempt on Wombosi's life because his children were in the room! And that ending between Bourne and the girl was just another manipulative ending. The guy's probably killed hundreds of people. Why does he HAVE to go to this one kid? Just because he remembers. It was his job! 3) This shaky cam nonsense! It is totally distracting and drained the film of any excitement, fun, suspense, AND entertainment value.4) No payoff! I wanted Bourne to kill that assassin (Karl Urban) who killed Marie (Franka Potente back in an early, quick cameo). He deserved it! I know why he didn't do it...Marie wouldn't have wanted him to...YAWN! I first saw this movie on a FULL airline flight and there was not one single OOH or AAH during the runtime and after it was over, NO ONE applauded. Shouldn't essentially an action movie have those moments of pleasure and excitement? I think mostly everyone fell asleep on it. Glad the IMDb rating for BS is now lower than the rating for BI...As it should be!",4,1,2,19 October 2009
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's most purely fun film!
","Another gem from the 1980s and by one of my favorite directors...the unique and special Tim Burton. One of the few 80s films that I think is REQUIRED viewing, especially by wannabe filmmakers, BEETLEJUICE is a prime example of 'less is more'. With a relatively unknown (at the time) cast, cheap claymation effects, cartoony cardboard sets, simple location shooting, and I'll bet made in a short period of time with the most simple script, Burton has fashioned one of the most original films in the last 30 years! BEETLEJUICE is most certainly Burton's most purely entertaining film AND his oddest. It perhaps is the REAL Tim Burton at play. While films like BATMAN, ED WOOD, SLEEPY HOLLOW all have the 'Hollywood' feel about them, BEETLEJUICE is the perhaps Burton's most 'personal' film. It all feels totally HIM.BEETLEJUICE is an amalgamation of comedy, horror, ghost story, animation, AND its a family film...weird?! It tells the tale of New Englanders Adam and Barbara Maitland (played with refreshing, confident, sublime glee by film newbies Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis), who die at the film's outset in a bridge accident and spend the bulk of the film as ghosts haunting their home of its new inhabitants. They are the Deetzes: daffy Charles (wacky Jeffrey Jones), his annoying wife Delia (hilarious Catherine O'Hara), and weird, goth teen daughter Lydia (brilliant newcomer Winona Ryder).The eclectic supporting cast also includes Glenn Shadix as Otho, and the iconic entertainers Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet and veteran actress Sylvia Sydney...Odd, strange, yet utterly brilliant casting! But the casting coup is the actor who plays the title role...Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice! Well, it's really spelled 'Betelgeuse', but Beetlejuice is funnier. This has got to be the most inviting role/performance that Keaton has ever given. He plays Beetlejuice so uninhibited, raw, and vulgar that you can't help but be fascinated by the character. I say that Beetlejuice is the best 'villain' of all of Burton's films, even the Batmans, because Beetlejuice just plain does not care. He is totally self-serving and lets NOTHING stand in his way! Keaton's Beetlejuice probably has more memorable lines in this 1 film than you'll find in any 10 random films combined! And that's incredible given that he is barely on screen. I rank this as one of the all-time comic performances! BEETLEJUICE is just plain enjoyable from start to finish. It's almost like watching a live action cartoon. Amazing how you are drawn into this comic book world so easily and take for granted the afterlife and its 'rules'. The background music adds to the eeriness. And there are some actual scary moments in it, esp. when Beetlejuice enters the picture. The cast chemistry is also indelible: Keaton, Davis, Baldwin, Ryder, O'Hara, Jones ALL do excellent work. At a run time of around only 90 minutes, BEETLEJUICE may be Burton's most entertaining work!",10,1,3,7 August 2009
Alien: Covenant," Second best Alien movie!
","As someone who really hated Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' prequel and think James Cameron's 'Aliens' sequel is painfully overrated, I did not have high hopes for Scott's second prequel ALIEN:COVENANT (2017), but thankfully my reservations were unfounded. I really love this movie! Alien:Covenant is easily, in my opinion, the 2nd best Alien film right behind Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece 'Alien'. Covenant succeeds where Prometheus failed. Prometheus was too pretentious where virtually character, except perhaps David and Shaw (the irony), were inconsequential and oddly performed. Very thankfully, the only 2 good and decent characters from Prometheus were the ones to survive and salvaged for the sequels.The plot of the film is that the Earth-originated ship The Covenant, carrying over 2000 colonists and over 1000 embryos, is on a permanent deep space mission to a faraway planetary system named Origae-6. While the colonists, including a 14-member crew, are in cryosleep, the ship is monitored by it's assigned synthetic being, the android Walter (superbly played by Michael Fassbender, who also played the android David in 'Prometheus'). Walter is a more advanced, less emotional version of David. During sleep, the ship is damaged by a solar flare, which forces Walter to awaken the crew, upon which the Captain (James Franco in a very brief cameo role) is burned alive when his cryotube catches fire.Rounding out the crew are a strong cast of characters led by actors Billy Crudup (Oram), Katherine Waterston (Daniels), Danny McBride (Tennessee), Carmen Ejogo (Karine), Demian Bichir (Lope), Amy Siemetz (Faris), Callie Hernandez (Upworth), Jussie Smollett (Ricks), and Tess Haubrich (Rosenthal). In particular, Crudup, Waterston, and McBride shine as the mission leaders that everyone looks to guidance and support. But in general I enjoyed the believable chemistry of these characters as a real crew who had each others' backs. More laid back and less internal animosity than the original Alien crew, the Covenant crew is focused on settling down and finding a permanent home.The mission is sidetracked by a transmission on a nearby planet and the Covenant crew proceeds to investigate as well as scout the location as a contingency for a permanent home to colonize. As they investigate, they find a crash-landed ship, the one that David and Shaw escaped from LV-223 with. A couple of crew members also accidentally ingest alien spores, wreaking incredible havoc and putting the entire mission at risk. They also run into David himself, as he recounts exactly what happened to both him and Shaw upon escaping LV-223.Alien:Covenant is a very spare film, cutting to the chase immediately. There are no wasted moments or scenes. The running time feels just about right. The acting very convincing, whether it's during the routine, mundane moments or during the more exciting action sequences. The characters are refreshingly normal, identifiable and easy to root for. Fassbender is exceptional in the dual roles of Walter and David and the staging of the scenes when they play off each other is amazingly shot. Even with the ties to the Alien franchise, Covenant is very much an entertaining movie-watching experience in it's own right. Is it as great as Alien? Of course not, no film in the franchise is or ever will be. But this film feels like the first one that truly follows up the original film and pays tribute to it's brilliance.",10,3,10,11 August 2017
