Blade Runner 2049," No Magic
","On the deepest level, Blade Runner (the original) magically reduced the most daunting questions of our existencewhat are we.who or what created uswhat is consciousness, memory, identity, empathy, love..to characters and relationships on screen, mainly Rachel and Deckard. Their moments together were beyond precious. The stars had to align for this to work. No such thing happened for this sequel. It is a good film and I will see it again but the two should not be confused.It's interesting that in 35 years the visual effects could not be appreciably improved..probably because we've passed the point of diminishing returns in hitek digital slambam. What is left is the story and acting and both did not overly impress. The death scene on the steps is an unoriginal mimicking of what is for me one of the greatest scenes ever.a soaked dying Rutger Hauer on the roof with the white dove. The music likewise was a poor wannabe of the original Vangelis.To have your heart, soul, and mind be touched deeply, powerfully and increasingly with each viewing by a film is an unforgettable experience, and when a film operates on 2 levels simultaneously, as a great action film (for most viewers)and as a spiritual experience for some, it becomes transcendent, a very rare thing for films. Such is Blade Runner for me. An example of another film of another genre which operates for me the same way is Somewhere in Time. For most, just a deceptively beautiful, schmaltzy love story. I've seen it countless times as I have Blade Runner. It triggers the same profound reflections on our being.",7,4,9,2 November 2017
