Raiders of the Lost Ark," is it better or not as good as last crusade
",I dont know try not to think about it for too long or you will have a nosebleed. maybe theyre just as good in their ways. my favorite scene in this one is the scene where um... ah... forget it the whole series is my favorite scene who can keep a straight face when the monkey does the hitler thing I strongly recommend all three.,10,0,0,8 May 2001
Unbreakable," the best film of the year.
",Unbreakable is NOT to be compared with the sixth sense. They are very different from each other in MANY ways. With that aside this movie had me glued to my seat throughout. I just finished it an hour ago and I just started whatching it again. This and sixth sense will be in my dvd collection sometime this week. The only way this compares to the sixth sense is that they both have unexpected and jaw dropping endings. I recommend seeing them both as quickly as possible and if you have a dvd rent the dvd version for great deleted scenes. M. Night Shylaman is a gifted director indeed and I look forward to seeing his future films.,10,0,0,4 July 2001
The Mummy," why kill off benny?
","This should not of happened, Benny held this movie up he stole the movie! The Mummy Returns has no benny and it feels like there is something missing thus not as funny as the first. I think it was a bad move by Mr. Sommers but anyway the movie was fun funny exciting and lighthearted. just make sure you check your brain at the door with mummy 1 and 2 did anybody notice the mpaa thing it said PG-13 for pervasive action adventure violence I did not think it had that much, and Mummy Returns says only adventure action and violence when Mummy 2 cleary has triple the action, strange. I stongly recommend both of them.",10,0,0,8 May 2001
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burtons best!
","This is by far the most buetiful Tim Burton film ever made. The acting is good but sometimes They overdid it. The score is great Thanks to Danny Elfman. Who I believe has done every Burton Film besides Ed Wood, wonder what happened there? Anyway this is a great Dark and sometimes colorful film and is the total opposite of Planet Of The Apes which I thought sucked big time, Tim Burton could of done sooo much better and the music was not so great either Danny must have run out of ideas. Anyway see Sleepy Hollow but stay clear of POTA! it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. See Batman or Edward Scizzor Hands instead after this one.",10,0,0,15 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Simply One Of The Most Amazing Films EVER Made.
",My only complaint about this film is that the beginning is a bit slow. *END OF COMPLAINTS* How do I even put words in to describe this movie...um...well The Acting was very impressive Elijah Wood put on a superb perfomance as did everyone else! also the visual effects in this film are among the top best ever seen on film! They are JAW DROPPING! EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS JAW....DROPPING!! Go see this movie! Hurry run! I am glasd to see that the film is # 6 on the 250 best list..it deserves it. What more is there to say...oh yeah even though the movie is like 3 hours and 30 mins I wanted more when the credits rolled...but another year to go...,10,0,0,20 December 2001
BASEketball," funniest movie since hot shots
",This is the only David Zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury right behind But I did not think Theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he. Dont listen to the critics especially Roger Ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews.Anyway see it you wont be dissapionted,10,0,2,10 May 2001
Die Hard 2," total opposite of die hard 3
",die hard 2 is a bloody shoot em up slam bang action movie perfect for ages 12 to 18 plenty of action sequences to keep you drooling unlike die hard 3 [a cat and mouse suspense film] with about two action scenes three would be pushing it. die hard two is perfect if your looking for a little action.,10,1,3,8 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," you bet your @ss im getting this on dvd
","action! action! action! alot of it so much action by the time the movie is over you will forget what just happened. Perfect for action fans I just wish Benny was in this one. I mean why not, characters who died in the first were in here. otherwise this movie was great just tell grandma to bring here earplugs!",10,0,0,21 May 2001
Die Hard," possibly the most action packed in the series you be the judge
",this movie is one of the only feel good action movies i wish they would make more of them. and like I said in my review of die hard 2 a total opposite of die hard 3 a cat and mouse suspence movie but a good one at that.die hard somehow make a smile on your face when its over possibly the best in the series but violent as usual I dont mind it Im fifteen I love it.,10,1,2,8 May 2001
Die Hard with a Vengeance," not an action film
",die hard 3 is not a slam bang shoot em up like 1 and 2. It is a cat and mouse suspense movie with one or 2 action scenes dont get me wrong you will be glued to the screen with interest I just wish they could of loosened up on the f words though geez!!too many to count. overall good movie but a one time watcher.,7,0,0,8 May 2001
