Black Swan," In Black Swan ballerina Nina get's the starring role in Swan Lake, but to dance this part the way she needs to she has to get in touch with her dark side.
","After all the great reviews for Black Swan and because i loved The Wrestler, i was very anxious to see this movie. And i have to say i was really disappointed. If i have to name my main problem with this film it is that it has no hart. Everything looks great but you never really get involved, it's all very cold.Natalie Portman does an OK job, but she has done better in the past in garden state and closer. All the characters are really flat and don't feel like real people at all. This movie resembles Requim for a Dream more than it does The Wrestler, and i also didn't like Requim because it was so totally negative. Come on in every life there is some silver lining. But Nina's life in Black Swan is one great drama, with only people around here who bring her down. Not realistic, plus the whole lesbian relationship was ridiculous. Totally overrated!",3,0,3,31 January 2011
