Requiem for a Dream," Best Addiction Movie Ever Made
","I saw this movie over 24 hours ago...and I still feel so bad. Don't get me wrong. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. But by the end of it, you're left sitting in your chair staring at the credits, with tears flowing down your face. And you ask yourself 'What...in the world did I just watch?' Requiem is one of those rare movies that, really, has no weakness. Usually there's one actor/actress that just ruins the movie a little bit, or the choice of music is bad, or the style of directing doesn't fit the story. This movie fires on all cylinders. Darren Aronofsky directs his gem with this movie. It's the movie that appears at the top of his directing resume. Jared Leto turns in the performance of a lifetime. Marlon Wayans was fantastic, turning in a performance you don't expect to see out of him. But the best acting was done by the great Ellen Burstyn. By the end of the movie, your heart feels so broken by what she's become. The transformation of her character ties a knot in your throat. There was a scene in the movie (don't worry, no spoilers) where I was sitting in my chair, watching her character progress. And I kept thinking 'stop it. Just stop it. Please.' This movie is the best movie that portrays the downfalls of drug abuse. IF you ever want to scare someone straight, recommend this movie to them.I loved this movie...but I don't think I can stand watching it again. It's too heartbreaking.",Null,0,1,25 November 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Brilliant Movie
","You should realize before watching this movie that there will be parts where the traditional 'real world' laws of physics will not apply. And do you know why? It's because it's a movie. People fail to realize that normal laws of nature do not apply to movies, especially movies like this.This movie is absolutely brilliant. Ben Stiller did a great job in directing this movie. His quick transitions between daydreams and real life work fantastically. I love movies where the setting is an intricate personality of the film. Midnight in Paris showcased Paris brilliantly, Collateral did the same for Los Angeles, and The Way did a fantastic job with Spain. This movie portrays the beauty of Iceland so vividly. Sean Penn's acting was superb.If you enjoy watching a movie with a good story and awesome cinematography, do yourself and watch this movie.",10,3,10,25 December 2013
12 Years a Slave," Masterpiece with an underrated performance by Lupita Nyong'o
","It took me a few minutes while the credits were rolling to muster the strength to physically stand up and walk out of the theater. This film completely floored me. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many, many good movies. Everybody was superb. McQueen's use of simple silence in this movie is so powerful. Chiwetel Ejiofor was so heart breaking in his performance. I felt so much compassion for the man that I had to remind myself it was just a movie. Michael Fassbender was completely ruthless and fascinating to watch unravel, and Benedict Cumberbatch's short (unfortunately) spell in this movie was among my favorite aspects of the film.However, one name that hasn't received nearly enough recognition is Lupita Nyongo'o. She played poor Patsy on Fassbender's plantation. There's a very prominent scene that I won't spoil, but it involves gruesome images of slave life in the 1800's. Her portrayal of Patsy was so emotional and traumatizing that you have no choice but to cry with her. She moves you. And that ending! Oh my God! Go see it. Now. Before the Oscars. I'm finding it very difficult for anyone to challenge Chiwetel Ejiofor for best actor this year.",10,3,7,16 December 2013
