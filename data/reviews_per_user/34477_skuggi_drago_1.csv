Marie Antoinette," Disappointing.
","This was a gigantic disappointment. I was expecting a period drama focused on the history of the time and the actual events taking place, but what I got was over 2 hours of a bunch of young adults playing around in fancy dresses and very bad wigs. The soundtrack is great, but does not fit in any way. This film turned Marie Antoinette's life into a bad teen drama and left me disgusted.",3,1,2,25 June 2018
