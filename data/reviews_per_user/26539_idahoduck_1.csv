3:10 to Yuma," Ridiculous ending
","Russel Crowes character has a date with the hangman, and all he can do is help the guy whose trying to make it happen? Why would anyone do that? And in the end he shoots all of the men trying to help him escape, climbs on the train and hands over his gun to the jailer on the train so he can keep his date with the hangman. This ain't no High Noon folks. I did like Peter Fondas character, and thought he did a very good job. There was nothing wrong with the acting, but the ending was not good to say the least. I would have thought the son shooting Ben Wade would have been more realistic, and although not great, certainly a better ending.",3,2,4,5 July 2009
