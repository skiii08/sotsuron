The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Wonderful performances - a new brat pack is born
","I watched this movie the other night on DVD after hearing some positive reviews about it in the media.First of all let me say that Ezra Miller (the gay half brother and life of the party), delivered an Oscar worthy performance and I am encouraged to watch 'We need to talk about Kevin', now as a result.As for Emma Watson, she is an absolute darling and a complete heart breaker for our poor hero.I am very pleased with the high school scenes and the lead actor's behavior was very believable.The soundtrack was superb, but probably wasted on anyone under 35. It sure was a nicer and simpler time when you made mix-tapes for your girlfriend full of love songs or the Smiths, whichever was more miserable at the time. There were no computers, no mobile phones, but still these people managed to lead exciting extra-curricular lives, as we all did back in the day.My only criticism is the abuse and mental illness all came as a bit of a surprise from a plot perspective. This was glossed over perhaps too much, and rushed through too quickly at the end.All in all, an excellent and profound picture. The chemistry between half brother and sister, their dance routines and the party sequences in general were just brilliant. I could watch this again soon, it is that good.",9,1,2,24 February 2013
Skyfall," Disappointing
","When this film was released in November 2012, it received excellent reviews. Therefore I had high hopes when I took the film out on DVD.What a letdown. The plot was very weak and had been used many times before.As a child I watched the Roger Moore Bond films, so he has always been my favorite Bond.It is a shame that the humor side of Bond has been removed.This film was far too long and even Javier Badem was weak as the villain.I am not a great fan of Daniel Craig as Bond, he is my least favorite, Clive Owen would have been much better. Hopefully now that he has done 3 films they will replace him with someone else.",5,7,16,24 February 2013
American Hustle," Really enjoyable movie
","This was great. First of all Christian Bale must surely be the best actor of his generation. I'm sorry, Bradley, you caught a supporting role here, you were good but not brilliant. Also, Amy and Jennifer were outstanding. I would have given Jennifer more dialogue, but she was terrific.The big surprise for me was Renner. His portrayal of the New Jersey mayor, was part Goodfellas, Godfather, Chris Christie, but all heart and every scene was unbelievably authentic. You could see how the Bale character fell in love with this guy.The plot fell a bit thin at the end, but I didn't care. This should have cleaned up at the Oscars instead of that space nonsense.",9,0,3,3 April 2014
Looper," They lost me in the middle
","So the idea of the film is very interesting, until you start to think about how this all pieces together.If you start demanding the viewer make enormous intellectual decisions while trying to concentrate on a fast moving sci-fi plot, then you are losing the audience by the minute. I watched this on DVD and was interrupted twice by my wife asking me to explain the plot. My 80 year old parents would have given up after 10 minutes.Anyway, Bruce Willis certainly deserved his fee for the movie. Why they plastered a fake nose on JGL thinking that made him Bruce Jnr, well it just didn't cut it for me. As to why the hell Emily Blunt agreed to do this film, it should have been Olivia Wilde or Elizabeth Banks.One point I would agree with - the demonised kid (future criminal overlord) was brilliant and very scary.What you had here was a killer idea - in the wrong hands - this had all the makings of a Total Recall (the original) and left me thinking B movie all over.You might enjoy this movie more if you are completely drunk or with a group of teenage boys who like violence.",6,4,8,24 January 2013
