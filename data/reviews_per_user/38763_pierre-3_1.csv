The Blair Witch Project," The most boring film of the decade!
","My wife and I decided to rent the movie as we had no chance to see it on the big screen this summer. Thank Goodness we only spent $4.50 instead of the $18 it would have cost at the theater! It's a shame some people are comparing it to Hitchcock. BWP is the living proof you can promote all sort of garbage on the Net and make people believe it's top art. It's a no script, no acting and no plot movie. Some filmakers are making a big buck on not much.",Null,1,2,22 October 1999
