Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnold at his best.
","Quite possibly one of Arnold's best films. The best of the three Terminators. Arnold comes back as the good guy and saves the day. With many classic one-liners that you wont forget. A must see movie. A film that was ahead of its time. The machines look unbelievable. Its a one of a kind movie, and one of the best trilogies ever made.",9,1,1,28 December 2003
The Matrix," Greatest Movie Ever!!!
","The Matrix has the greatest fight scenes in the history of movies. One of the greatest movies of all time, with a plot that will you keep you wanting more. A twist of religion that has never been displayed in a picture film. An instant classic, and a must own DVD. Two thumbs up a perfect film.",10,0,1,28 December 2003
