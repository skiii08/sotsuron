Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For best results: believe all the hype.
","After all the anticipation, all the hype and all the unfavorable critical reviews recently, I went into this movie with a combination of hopeless anticipation and expectations of inevitable disappointment. Apparently, that was the perfect mindset going into this movie because I liked it very much.As with any CGI, much of it looked plastic and phony, but considering the scope of some of the shots, one almost had to be impressed. Almost. All of the dialogue is oppressively awkward. Jake Lloyd much of the time is delivering his lines with the typical overzealousness of child actors, but it's refreshing that he's the only one speaking with an unvarnished American accent. The big battle between the Gungans & the Federation droids is rehashed _Jedi_ without the midgets in fur, and the starship battle is identical to trying to blow up the Death Star in _Star Wars_ & _Jedi_. On the other hand, the pod-racing scene, even if you see its results coming a mile away, is thrilling and most of the lightsaber battles are great, even if their climax did seem a bit anticlimatic.At one point early in the film, the sight of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi swimming toward an underwater city was notably reminiscent of him in _Trainspotting_ looking for his heroin suppositories in England's dirtiest lavatory. Ian McDiarmid's comment about the young Skywalker is almost throwaway, but quite amusing. A scene in the Naboo throne room where a blast door is abruptly lowered is straight out of _Star Wars_. It's that kind of silliness which subtly recalls the kitchy humor of the original trilogy. It seemed like Lucas was making this for the kids, not the gen-Xers who have been waiting for this their whole life, but that's okay, just like it's okay that this movie seemed more expository than pure narrative, because by the end of it I was already hopelessly anticipating Episode II.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
Resident Evil," downright shocked at how not lame it was.
","Traditionally, this time of year is devoted to films that are either bucking for Oscar consideration or too dreary to be released at any other time of the year, basically meaning that any movie one sees before the couple of weeks before Memorial Day is going to be really good or really bad. It seems that, this year, those movies that aren't Academy-Award hopefuls have been, across the board, gawd awful, representing some of the worst films that Hollywood has had to offer in the past 5 years. With those unpleasant experiences in mind, it is with a sense of sheer trepidation and lowered expectations that one goes into a movie like _Resident Evil_, whose trailers make it seem akin to most of the wretched movies that have come out so far this year. Perhaps, it is because nothing exceptional is expected of it that I begrudgingly have to admit that this movie is really not that bad. In fact, I could go so far as to say it was quite watchable. admittedly, there are plot holes, Michelle Rodriguez seems wasted in her role, and the material owes a great debt to George Romero's work, but once one gets past all that, a big dumb popcorn movie is there for the taking. In its favor, the actors give convincing performances, the cgi effects are used sparingly enough so that when one does get large doses of it, they don't look obviously fake like in the Harry Potter movie or _Jumanji_, and the movie overall displays an understanding that while it doesn't have the chops to actually scare you, it also doesn't over-rely on startling moments like so many horror movies will nowadays. Is it worth the full price of admission? Compared to some of the alternatives playing in theaters, I'm afraid so.As a sidenote, who among us knew that, at this point in our lives, with Paul T. Anderson slaving away on an Adam Sandler movie, the other Paul Anderson would make a more satisfying movie without any pretenses?",8,0,0,14 March 2002
