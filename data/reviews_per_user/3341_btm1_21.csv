The Rock," Patently unrealistic plot but many spectacular crashes and explosions
","The plot is laughable, with as many holes as swiss cheese, but the acting is good and the action fast paced. The basis for all of the action is an extortion threat against the government. In exchange for $100 million in payments to the families of marines who died on secret missions and thus (supposedly) were never recognized by the government, a bunch of renegade marines led by a highly decorated, capable, experienced marine general will not destroy San Francisco.Before the movie begins this renegade marine combat unit captured the former Alcatraz Island Prison, 'the Rock,' and has about 80 civilian tourists hostage on the island. They also brought with them surface-to-surface guided missiles and missile launchers(on the Alcatraz ferry or some other unstated means of transport). Although the US military has no weapons with lethal chemical or biological warheads, the missiles in this movie are armed with deadly mass destruction chemical warheads. The missiles apparently have aerodynamic controls, and are not ballistic missiles, because they can radically change direction in mid-flight. As such, US fighter aircraft, if deployed in time, could easily shoot them down after they were launched, but that solution is not considered in the movie. (Perhaps the chemical would be released into the city's atmosphere even if the missiles were destroyed in flight, but the possibility is not even discussed by the authorities. Nor is the option discussed of using the military's knowledge of the missiles' remote control communications to redirect the guidance systems via appropriately coded radio commands.) The major action is then about a seal team's attempt to forcibly recover and disable the missile warheads. A second action sequence is the escape of the Sean Connery character, who is a prisoner held incommunicado by the White House, and a violent chase through the hills of San Francisco with lots of crashes and fireballs.The premise of the script has major problems. In any extortion threat, both the criminal and victim lose once the threat is carried out. That is, once executed, the bad guys no longer have bargaining power. For extortion to work the victim has to believe that whatever he is afraid will happen will occur if he does not comply with the criminal's demands, AND WON'T occur if he does comply. That point is lost on the criminally insane marines commanded by the Marine General, ably played by Sam Harris, and by the inept or uncaring script writer. The bad marines want the money and think that if they launch the missiles after their deadline is up that the government will then send them $100 million, like paying a ransom AFTER learning that a kidnapped victim is dead.Another problem with the scenario is that the script fails to address how the bad guys expected to be able to have access to the $100 million even if the government agreed to give it to them. After all, they would still be on an island in the middle of San Francisco bay. The government could transfer money to accounts designated by the criminals, but the government could also then freeze those accounts or arrest anyone who tried to use the money. The plot outcome is also predictable. The character played by Nicolas Cage is obviously going to be the hero who will survive. Whether Sean Connery will also survive is not as sure, but it is easy to predict that he will not fail in his mission. Also, there is no doubt that San Francisco will not end up being destroyed. In the movie the government elects to keep the threat secret, so as to prevent panic among the citizens. The movie could have been made more interesting by having the government experts argue over notifying or not notifying the public, and, if the decision was to notify the public, whether to recommend evacuation or the alternative of staying indoors with wet blankets covering windows or other places that outside air could get in. (This was what Israel advised its citizens to do in the first Gulf War when under attack by Iraqi modified SCUD ballistic missiles.)I know crashes and explosions are expensive and dangerous to produce in a movie, but having seen many of these I find new ones rather repetitive and boring and not a reason to see a movie. I'd prefer the producers had used the money instead to get a better script.",2,4,9,8 April 2007
Love and Death," Not very funny
","I'm a big fan of Woody Allen, but I found this one boring to the point that I considered not watching the whole thing. But it got better and I'm glad that I saw it through to the end. The most interesting parts for me were when Woody's and Diane's (still in her hippy period) characters debate philosophical meanings. Is there a God and does He care about us? What is love? Are moral standards absolute? In 'Love and Death' Woody Allen relies more on physical (as opposed to cerebral) comedy than he does in his Annie Hall and subsequent masterpieces. For example, Boris being accidentally shot from a cannon and weapons that break when Boris tries to use them. There are plenty of individual Monte Python quality comic bits, but that kind of comedy has for me by now lost what edge it once had. Much of comedy comes from the unsuspecting audience being surprised by the punch line. Of his early films that use a lot of physical comedy, I recall really liking 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.' I haven't seen it in decades (perhaps not since it was first released) and wonder if its humor still works today? However, some of the shticks in 'Love and Death' still feel fresh, such as the comically attired Angel of Death, and the messages that newly dead people give to our protagonist. Some of the physical comedy bits, such as Boris being accidentally shot from a cannon, reminded me of Buster Keaton. Buster Keaton and Ernie Kovacs (his early TV show) were the best at physical comedy.",4,2,6,2 August 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," Regular viewers won't care that film students and professional critics think it not as good as Miyazaki's earlier work
","I caught this wonderfully animated family film when browsing Independent Film Channel (IFC) on cable TV in 2009. IFC claims all the films they shown are uncut. I had no preconceived ideas about the film, never heard of it before hand, and was not familiar with director Miyazaki or his previous work. So my review is based on how I felt about the movie, not how it stacks up against classics or film technique.Although I am an elder adult and watched it alone, not with my grandchild, I found it engrossing and enjoyable. (Although it is as suitable for young viewers as 'Snow White' and 'Sleeping Beauty.') The story, an anti-war fantasy or fairy tale, was original and unpredictable, which I like. The wizard Howl (who turns out to be the main male character of the film) says at one point something to the effect of 'The problem with a war between rulers is that the bombs fall on the innocent civilians.' The villains turn out to be complex, not just pure evil, and sometimes not evil at all. The scenery and costumes are done as a period piece, sort of Victorian era Europe. Even if just viewed as a series of still paintings with no story they would still be interesting to look at.In keeping with the imaginative story, I think with some imagination they could have come up with a more romantic English title than 'Howl's Moving Castle.' The moving castle certainly is interesting and plays a huge role in the story, but I would have liked something that suggests a struggle between wizards, a struggle over love and hate, and a struggle over war and peace.",8,1,2,9 September 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Even the special effects stink
","If this version of the Incredible Hulk was done in the fashion of an animated cartoon perhaps I would have liked it better. Graphic artists really know how to draw monsters.Here the monsters look like some kind of monster suit a kid might get for Halloween. They are so obviously artificial! The special effects of the monsters throwing cars about also seem ridiculously artificial. Am I being picky expecting a comic book character to appear realistic? Well, they did it in the original TV series. They used a simple technique. Instead of costumes (or whatever) the TV series used super-sized Lou Ferrigno as the hulk, just painting his skin green. But a Ferrigno sized hulk apparently was too small for the makers of this film.In the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit I am not a big fan of action films. There are some I liked, including about everything by Quentin Tarentino. I liked Superman and Batman films, but got bored by too many sequels. But the main reason I wanted to see the Incredible Hulk was to see how the they handled the transformation, expecting something outstanding what with all the technology advances made in the past decade.",1,6,12,8 August 2009
In Bruges," Think 'Pulp Fiction' but darker
","We visited Bruge once. Its memorable and exhausting spiral staircase medieval bell tower is featured in this comic tragedy. There is even a glimpse of the rope that substitutes for a banister. Some of the action also takes place on its canals.'In Bruge'has something of a film-noir feel, but with humor added. The 2008 film's story about Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrel) brought to mind Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in 1994's 'Pulp Fiction.' But I thought 'Bruge' a darker movie. It seems more tragic, and the humor more subtle, than 'Pulp Fiction.' Still, the more I think of it, the more I can see similarities. For example, in both films lesser criminals make the mistake of crossing paths with them. 'In Bruge' has encounters with incidental 'color' characters who show up again later in ways more significant to the plot.From other reviews I now guess the hit men are supposed to be part of a criminal gang; however, my initial impression from their skill, discipline and ethics (accidentally killing innocents is a violation of their code) was that they were an IRA cell.I thought the movie dragged a bit in the beginning, but then picked up steam.",9,0,4,14 December 2008
Unbreakable," Unbreakable is barely bearable
","Some other reviewers have compared this to the 'Sixth Sense,' an earlier movie starring Bruce Willis. The problem is that the writer and director of the Sixth Sense knew what their story was about and developed it beautifully. This is not the case with 'Unbearable.' The director put together a film that is dark, dreary and slow paced, with an irritating omnipresent dirge as the sound track. The story is disjointed, confusing and unbelievable. I mean at times I thought it was supposed to be some avant garde surreal or experimental film, where everything is some sort of symbolism. I usually don't get what the director is trying to say in those modernistic movies. Unfortunately, 'Unbreakable' was not that good and no easier to follow.Bruce Willis plays a security guard with a wife and child that he is apparently simultaneously estranged from and living with. In college he had a promising football career until he and his wife (its not clear whether they were married yet) were in an auto accident that ended his football career. Most of the movie is spent with his son and Samuel Jackson (playing the security guard's polar opposite, a brittle boned and accident prone comic book collector, trying to convince the security guard that he is really supposed to be a superhero.Eventually he is convinced to spend an evening as a kind of vigilante looking for some evildoing to thwart, sort of like a neighborhood watch volunteer who goes on patrol with no cell phone to call 911, no flashlight, and no weapon. We are shown a brief sequence of crimes that he ignores. In addition to being 'unbreakable,' he is apparently unwittingly psychic and gets some idea of who is thinking about a criminal act. At about that time we hear one of the family say something such as 'at last its over.' I hoped that was the final scene but no such luck. There is a final twist which apparently we are somehow supposed to figure out from newspaper clippings on a wall. It is clear from his horrified facial expression that the security guard understands the twist and then lets the audience in on what the clippings mean.The only reason I didn't shut this off before it was finished was I had invested time watching it and wanted to at least learn where the director was going with this. What a waste of good actors!",1,5,9,28 March 2009
Seven Years in Tibet," A Tibetan version of 'Lawrence of Arabia.'
","Like 'Lawrence of Arabia', the scenery (Tibet and the Himalayan Mountains) add to the appeal of this film. But there is also a story line connection -- a British office/Austrian mountain climber with personal psychological issues becomes adviser to Prince Faisal/the Dalai Lama. That's about as far as I can stretch the analogy because Lawrence led the Bedouins to victory over the Turks while Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) was not a military adviser and Tibet was had no victory over Communist China. I thought that Brad Pitt did a splendid job of showing arrogance, disdain and sensitivity at the appropriate times of the story. David Thewlis is perfection as Peter Aufschnaiter, a more disciplined and sensitive leader of a German mountain climbing expedition. Harrer, who already is recognized as a champion European climber, is a member of Aufschnaiter expedition to conquer Nanga Parbat in British India. During the climb they encounter adverse weather conditions. Harrer want to continue to a higher level that he hopes will be above the storm, but team leader Aufschnaiter insists on descending instead. At the bottom they are imprisoned as enemy aliens as World War II has begun and Germany is now an enemy of the British. (Note:Austria was annexed into Germany before the Allies declared war on Germany.) They plot to escape but have limited options of where to escape to. Tibet is the closest independent nation but no foreigners are allowed in Tibet.",10,1,2,19 March 2014
Black Book," World War II from the viewpoint of a resistance fighter
","There have been many films about World War II's European Theater. Among the best ones I can recall at this moment are 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Schindler's List' 'The Great Escape,' 'Patton,' and 'The Longest Day.' But none of these were from the viewpoint of a resistance fighter. 'Black Book' fills that gap and is as powerful a film as any of these. Unlike the others, this one apparently is a work of fiction. Because the film is a flashback from a kibbutz in 1956 Israel, we know that the protagonist, Rachel Stein aka Ellis de Vries, survives the war. But what she goes through to survive is so dreadful and yet seems so believable. The story keeps you at the edge of your seat all of the time. I don't think there is a dull spot in it. Sometimes it is the suspense of will the partisans accomplish their mission or will they be caught. When battles break out who will survive? If that is not enough to keep you alert, there is also a considerable amount of nudity and debauchery. The film is mostly believable, but by the end there are so many twists and betrayals that it loses some credibility. However I didn't realize how far fetched it got until it was over and I began to think of all that happened and why the Nazis didn't just destroy the resistance cell without waiting for the partisans to attack before springing their trap. As done, the Nazis as well as the partisans suffer casualties in the traps the Nazis set for them. Nevertheless, the chaos at the end of the war with vengeance seeking Dutch mobs and with the victorious allies (Canadian soldiers were the liberators) trusting the wrong people seemed all too realistic. Carice van Houten is terrific as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. Although much of the film is in German and Dutch with English subtitles, there are times when it is appropriate for English to be spoken.",10,2,5,11 February 2009
MASH," Sally Kellerman was key to this movie's success.
","I just finished watching the movie (whose title, like the TV show that started in 1972, was spelled M*A*S*H) and found it just as good as I had remembered from seeing it, originally, in the movie theater. I also have read the book on which the picture was based, and have seen many episodes of the extraordinarily popular TV series.  I liked the movie much better than the series, while recognizing that the series was better than other seriocomic TV series.  As everyone is aware, M*A*S*H was more about the Vietnamese War than the Korean War it was set in. In many ways the series was more serious, more blatantly anti-war, than the movie.  But there are many serious anti-war undercurrents in the movie, such as blood pulsing from a patients mouth during an operation, the shots of the the football players smoking grass on the sidelines, and even the long hair and facial hair of the doctors.  Audiences in 1970 were not used to graphic depictions of woumds and surgery.  Pot and long hair were 'hippy' make love not war symbols.  So it was definitely an anti-war movie.
But the reason that I am posting this comment is that in my recent viewing of the picture I first realized how critical Sally Kellerman's performance was to the picture's success,  She is not only damn good looking but her acting is terrific.  While her cheer-leader scenes help keep the picture from stalling during the football game, it is her initial arrival at the base, and, later, her bathrobe clad complaint to Col. Blake, that attracted my attention regarding the quality of her acting.",9,0,3,17 July 2003
Pan's Labyrinth," Engossing but not for children
","This film is often called a fantasy. Fantasy is correct only in that a part of the film takes place in the imagination (or, delusion) of a girl who is escaping from the horrendous reality of a brutal civil war in which fascists were the victors whose dictator (Franco) ruled Spain long after the end of the German and Italian fascist regimes. It is definitely NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. Aside from the fantasy portion being mostly as dark, ugly and dangerous as a horror movie, the lengthier reality portion presented chilling shots of torture and an unfeeling sadistic commanding officer.Nevertheless, for adults, it is an engrossing, if disturbing film. Although in the film the leftist Republicans have a local victory, defeating the Fascist military unit sent to hunt them down, in real life the war ended with the victory of the right-wing rebel forces (with military support from Nazi Germany), the overthrow of the Republican government, and the founding of a dictatorship led by General Francisco Franco. After the civil war ended in April 1939, all right-wing parties were merged into the single Fascist party of the Franco regime.I read where there were parallels between the fantasy and the reality portions of the movie. Perhaps the moral is that despite the real death of the heroine (the Republican regime), it was not completely forgotten and eventually its sprouts and blossoms grew again.",10,3,12,30 September 2009
Being John Malkovich," Best ever true science fiction, should have won Best Picture Oscar
","In the 1940s and 50s I was fascinated by the classic science fiction novels and short stories of the times, such as works by Heinlein, Asimov, Bradbury, Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Jules Verne, among others. This was a distinctly different genre than Star Wars and Star Trek. Writer Charlie Kaufman's 'Being John Malkovich' is the best film story ever of that original sci-fi genre.Not only does it have an incredibly imaginative entertaining story, the film is perfectly directed and acted. Despite being a comedy, Kaufman's screenplay demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of human emotions, and even has moments of philosophical questioning.In addition to starting with a great screenplay, the director Spike Jonze and the cast are all excellent. Catherine Keener exudes sexy manipulative bitch without relying on great beauty. John Malkovich gets a chance to exercise all of his acting talents. Charlie Sheen has a cute cameo as himself as a womanizer. Cameron Diaz was great in a role as the dowdy wife of the main protagonist, an artistic puppeteer (John Cusack). Although I knew she was in the cast, I didn't even recognize her in the part until late in the story.",10,0,2,17 December 2010
Duck You Sucker," A Fistful of Dynamite - Duck You Sucker
","At first blush this would seem to be another Sergio Leone 'spaghetti western.' One of the greatest actors of the last half of the 20th Century, Rod Steiger ('The Illustrated Man,' Jud in 'Oklahoma,' 'On the Waterfront,' 'The Pawnbroker,' 'In the Heat of the Night') is Juan Miranda, a Mexican bandit chief. But this is not the Eli Wallach one-dimensional bandit chief of Leone's famous 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' In the beginning we see Miranda as a brutish, illiterate, immoral thug. But a much more complex personality is developed in this movie, and Steiger is splendid in the role.John H. Mallory (James Coburn) is an old Irish revolutionary bomb expert traveling in Mexico(for reasons we don't learn until the middle of the film) in the Mexican Revolution era of Zapata and Pancho Villa. John is motorcycling on a road in a barren part of Mexico when he encounters Juan and his family who try to rob him. John counters Juan's guns with his explosives starting is a comical string of Juan's attempts to capture John, who he wants to use to aid him in robbing a bank he had dreamt of robbing since he saw it as a child.The two do become embroiled in the Mexican Revolution, to the dismay of Juan who sees the futility in revolutions because his experience is that a successful revolution just results in one set of rulers replacing the other, with the peasants suffering continuing under the new regime (after his release from prison leftist Mexican muralist David Siqueiros expressed a similar disillusionment in a mural depicting a sequence of revolutions that circled back on itself.)I saw the English language version of the film on cable television's Independent Film Channel (IFC), which shows films uncut. It included the opening scene of Juan urinating while waiting for the stage coach.",10,0,4,2 December 2009
Tropic Thunder," Ben Stiller blossoms: A great take-off on war movies and Hollywood in general full of tongue in cheek humor
","Although Tropic Thunder is a take-off on adventure films, and maybe of reality TV, perhaps some commenters didn't realize it is a comedy. I don't think it is among the greatest comedies of all time, but it is at least at the top of the next tier.This is not a comedy to take your children to. It is a true adult comedy. Despite being chock full of violence and special effects, it is not a slap-stick comedy. There is a scene of farting, but it is not the farts that are intended to titillate; instead it pokes fun at the concept of people finding farts funny. Most of the humor comes from Ben Stiller (who wrote, directed, starred and produced Tropic Thunder) exaggerating the violence, blood and gore of war films. (If someone should watch Tropic Thunder thinking it an adventure movie, they won't be disappointed by the pyrotechnics.) He also pokes fun at the movie industry's political correctness regarding racial stereotyping, retardation, and homosexuality.I thought the opening 'previews of coming attractions' were very clever and had me fooled at first. I watched 'Tropical Thunder' on HBO and was at first uncertain whether the previews were part of Tropic Thunder or real HBO ads.I never was a fan of the string of highly successful but somewhat juvenile comedies ('Meet the Parents', 'Meet the Fockers,' 'Night in the Museum,' 'There's Something About Mary') that Ben Stiller has been cast in. But I got the idea that he probably had a lot more than that to offer when I saw him in 'Keeping the Faith' (although this came out before all but one of the others I've mentioned, I didn't see it until later.) Kirk Lazarus tells Tugg Speedman (Stiller) that Hollywood gives Oscars to films about retarded people who are not totally retarded ('Rain Man,' 'Forrest Gump') but shuns films about pure retardation ('I Am Sam').I recommend not reading too much about 'Tropic Thunder' before you see it, or you will miss one of the treats at the end when the cast is disclosed. Without advance information you'll never believe who played some of the roles. As a director, Stiller must have inspired his cast because he got nothing but great performances from them all, although only one received an Oscar nomination.",8,1,2,13 August 2009
Enchanted," Reality: 'Enchanted' failed to stay with its fantasy plot
","'Enchanted' starts out in saccharine sweet animation. Not having read anything about the film in advance, I feared that the whole film would be a rehash of Disney classic animated films. The best part of the film was the transition from cartoon characters to live actors, which I wasn't expecting and was done very well. The next scenes with the fantasy world princess- to-be trying to cope with real world New York City was also well done, although I would have hoped that even in NYC the police would have eventually noticed her and taken her to Bellevue Hospital's psychiatric ward. Why Robert didn't do that after observing her actions and talking to her in his apartment also was more fantasy than reality, although it was in the reality part of the story.I really enjoyed Giselle getting the help of the real world animal kingdom in cleaning Robert's apartment, including rats and roaches. Hopefully the rats disease spreading fleas were well behaved. Denying the animals of the real world the ability the animated animals had to speak in human voice was a nice touch. I also liked the next day scenes when Giselle got the denizens of Central Park singing and dancing. But I hate it when a good story is ruined by producers who think all movies must have more destruction and special effects. The story line of Enchanted is that the Queen doesn't want her stepson to marry his 'true love' because she fears that when the bride became a princess she would want to usurp the Queen's crown. That seems a rather weak reason for a Queen to plot to keep them from meeting and, when that failed, to have the girl killed. But I can accept that as I can assume the Queen, whose magical powers seem limitless, is not only power mad but also paranoid. Of course it would have been simpler for her to just eliminate her step-son. What I object to is that after Giselle chooses Robert Philip over Prince Edward, the Queen still sees a need to kill Giselle. I would have expected the Queen to be happy to see Giselle and Robert become a couple. Instead of the violent ending that is in vogue, the film could have ended with everyone, including the Queen, living happily ever after. Or at least transfer the Queen's wrath to Nancy, who seems in danger of becoming the Prince's new love. The actual ending has Edward and Nancy reversing the plunge off an endless cliff in the kingdom of Andalasia, although Edward previously did not have the ability to soar up a cliff. It is also regrettable that Nancy had no time to let her work know that she wouldn't be to work the next day because she was leaving the real world. Do you think any of her friends and family made it to her wedding?",3,2,7,20 February 2009
District 9," Aliens and apartheid - fascinating science fiction
","One of the things I liked about 'District 9' is its avoidance of typical science fiction film clichés. As in many science fiction movies, a huge flying saucer arrives and hovers over a major city. No, not New York or Washington, but post-Mandela Johannesburg, South Africa. Another premise that shows the writers, Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, are not dealing with clichés is that the aliens in the saucer are emaciated and unorganized. The South African government helps these aliens get out of their ship and cordons off an area in the city for their use. They call that area 'District 9'. Over many years, the South African population grows disenchanted with the aliens because of their disgusting habits and dependence on the public for their housing and sustenance (they consume large quantities of cat food.) District 9 has become a disreputable slum. So the government decides to relocate the aliens to a different area (District 10) far outside of the city. This is obviously a reference to South Africa's apartheid past, when blacks were required to live in designated townships. The story is told in a documentary reality TV style, with never-shown videographers following the actions of the bureaucrat assigned to manage the transfer of the aliens that we the audience are supposed to be watching. Like other films and TV series of that genre ('The Office' comes to mind) we soon see scenes in which that format no longer works. One could imagine that the documentary film makers had filmed a staged reenactment of what had happened, but as we do with 'The Office,' it is easier to just ignore the discrepancy. The second half of the film does have some clichés, notably a super-powerful and nearly indestructible machine that is controlled by movements of the person inside it. Although the first part of the film is good drama, it eventually turns into an adventure film with violence, weapons, and chase scenes. The capabilities the writers give to the alien technology is perhaps inconsistent between the early scenes and later ones. But the film accomplishes what many good science fiction novels and short stories of the past have done in giving us some philosophical issues to ponder over.",7,2,9,3 March 2011
Mamma Mia!," You don't have to an ABBA fan to enjoy this if you don't take it seriously
","This film was more enjoyable than I expected. I found it to be a lot of fun.Although I recognize 'Dancing Queen' and 'Take A Chance On Me' as big hits, I don't really know much about the singing group ABBA and the songs they wrote. According to the reviews of 'Mamma Mia,' I shouldn't have liked this musical. But it was free on my cable TV so I thought I would watch a little to see for myself if it was as bad as some reviews said. After all, while Meryl Streep has been in occasional 'B' movies (e.g., 1994's 'The River Wild'), her performances in her movies have all been worth watching.But despite all of its faults, and with the knowledge that the film is not meant to be taken seriously, I found I really enjoyed 'Mamma Mia.' As has already been described in other reviews, the plot (a girl, raised by a single mother (played by Meryl Streep), is about to be married and invites three men to the wedding to give her away on her belief that one of the three is her father) is merely a device on which to hang a number of Abba songs, not all of which have lyrics that are completely appropriate to the story. The fun is watching the mostly tongue-in-cheek performances. Meryl Streep did some singing in at least one of her previous films, but she really gets to show off her more than adequate singing ability in 'Mamma Mia.' Accompanying her as a trio are long time Broadway musical star and comedic actress Christine Baranski, and British actress/performer Julie Walters. The one star who seemed miscast as a singer was Pierce Brosnan.",7,1,2,19 July 2009
Garden State," Slow moving and not particularly believable, although the acting is good
","Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff), a Hollywood TV actor between roles and working as a waiter, is estranged from his family, and on tons of antidepressants (I think Effexor, Zoloft and Prozac are mentioned) and antidepressant boosters (including lithium and Depakote).* Largeman returns to his small town home for the first time in years to attend his mother's funeral. He plans to be there only a few days. He goes to a neurologist's office because he's been experiencing brief but intense headaches) where he meets Sam (Natalie Portman), who has a quirk of constantly fibbing.Eventually we learn that his father is his psychiatrist and the one who prescribed all the drugs. (The film doesn't go into how the father justifies renewing prescriptions without examining the patient in 9 years. It does have another doctor point out that the father knows it is improper for him to be his son's psychiatrist.) We also learn that Largeman was shipped away to a boarding school after he caused an accident that left his mother paraplegic.Largeman is recognized by his old friends in town and spends most of the visit with them and new friend Sam and avoids his father. His friends consider him somewhat of a celebratory because he was on TV. Sam is helping him deal with his psychological problems and a romance is developing.I found the film to be slow moving and serious with relatively little comic relief,although it does have a romantic comedy end.* Depakote is FDA approved as an anti-seizure medicine. Lithium is approved for bipolar disorder. However, psychiatrists sometimes use one or both of these in combination with an antidepressant because they tend to boost the effectiveness of the antidepressant. Although Largeman decided to quit them cold turkey, in reality there is mental health danger if one is not weaned slowly from them. In addition, people using these drugs need to have their blood tested periodically because of a dangerous muscle wasting side effect they can cause as well as potential kidney damage. Furthermore, there are strong cautions about using alcohol or other recreational drugs when on these medicines. Having personal experience with such medications caused me to see the film as unbelievable.",5,1,2,3 April 2009
There Will Be Blood," Lacked explanation of the changes in the lead character's personality.
","I saw this on a large screen HDTV on Showtime. Even with a large screen TV the screen is minuscule compared to a movie theater's. Thus I could appreciate the huge vistas that must have been awesome in a theater, although on TV the effect is greatly diminished. There were some additional good things about the film, including some unusual closeups of the Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) oil man character using a pickax. Also there are a great many highly dramatic scenes that are staged and acted well.The negatives, on the other hand, included a style so minimal that it was difficult to comprehend the changes in the Daniel Day Lewis character. In the initial scenes I could view the oil man as a sympathetic and even heroic character. But when his character changes drastically, we are given no explanation. It is hard to care about any of the roles in the film, except perhaps for the oil man's son, H.W.Apparently, according to other reviews, the earliest scene showing Daniel in a deep hole using a pickax was to indicate he was looking for silver, and perhaps accidentally found oil just bubbling up in the deep hole he made. That was not clear to me at all.Neither was his character development. The film offers no explanation or clarification of the changes he undergoes, except at one point he says that he never really liked people. When he says that, I couldn't tell whether he is being truthful or not. If we accept that explanation for his character defect (and there is no explanation of why he doesn't really like people), then that means his earlier friendly attitude and the interest he showed in his child were just put-ons to fool the suckers he was taking advantage of. But some of that earlier behavior was when no one else was around. Perhaps what the movie is trying to illustrate is that as people get wealthier they get nastier, a corollary perhaps to 'power tends to corrupt.' I really couldn't tell from the story development.Despite the cutting out any explanation of the character development, the film is a bit long (2 hrs and 38 minutes). Why didn't they cut instead some of the lengthy scenes showing nothing but a character walking from one location to another?",3,0,2,25 March 2009
August Rush," Engrossing modern-day fantasy about a boy who followed the music
","One of the nicest features of this movie is its sound track, a harmonious blend of classical and popular (rock, jazz and gospel choral) musical styles.The story is about a boy, Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore), raised in an orphanage without any musical opportunity, who hears music in everything. He believes that his parents, whom he never knew and doesn't know if they are even alive, will one day find him. At the orphanage the other children know of his obsession with music that only he hears and shun him as a 'freak.' After being bullied by older boys, he runs away in an effort to follow the music he hears, and encounters, apparently for the first time in his life, actual musical instruments and live performers. It turns out he is a musical prodigy that can play any instrument without instruction and can read and write music after only a minute or two of instruction. In New York City's Washington Square he meets a boy about his own age playing the guitar for tips, who introduces him to an Oliver Twist collection of musical beggars working for a Fagin-like character called the Wizard (Robin Williams). When the Wizard realizes how valuable an addition to his group Evan will be, he gets him to adopt a stage name, 'August Rush,' in an effort to prevent people from identifying him as the boy whose picture the orphanage is circulating as a run-away.Inter-cut with the boy's story is the story of his parents. Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), Evan's birth mother, is a virtuoso classical musician. Evan is the result of a single passionate night with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish rock singer-guitarist. Although they believe the other to be their soul mates, Lyla's father prevents them from seeing each other the next night and they lose all contact with each other. Lyla is pregnant from the encounter, and as a result of an accident has an emergency delivery. When she regains consciousness her father tells Lyla that the baby died in childbirth. It is not until years later when he is on his deathbed does he confesses to Lyla that he lied and that the child lived.As the movie is a fantasy, it works out that the mother, father and son are all in New York again, with both Lyla and Evan participating in a philharmonic orchestra concert in the park.The film is fairly fast paced; I was never bored. In addition to the music, Keri Russell was perfect as Lyla. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was also very good. It was not Robin Williams' best performance. In one sense Wizard is a sympathetic character whom we are led to believe also was an unappreciated musical talent with a sad childhood and who is aiding the talented kids he collects escape from bad family situations. On the other hand, he is a despicable monster exploiting the children for his own advantage. Balancing these two conflicting traits requires a sensitive performance that I don't think Mr. Williams demonstrated.",7,1,2,22 July 2009
RED," Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich!
","The plot of RED (not to be confused with Warren Beatty's epic 'Reds') is not intended to be believable. The plot is only a vehicle for showcasing the talents of a group of truly excellent actors in a comedy. It is very very funny. A lot of really good lines and comic repartee. I am reminded of the exchange in 'Crocodile Dundee' when a punk attempts to rob Crocodile with a switchblade, and Dundee says, 'You call that a knife? This is a knife,' while pulling his large Bowie knife from his boot.Of the star-studded cast, some are reprising character types they've used before. Bruce Willis is the lovable bald tough guy. Mary-Louise Parker uses the same character traits she uses in Showtime's 'Weeds' series. Morgan Freeman plays his cameo role as the same Morgan Freeman character we've become familiar with. I'm not saying they aren't good or that they are limited to those portrayals (Willis, for instance, plays a different character when he wears his hairpiece), just that the roles are no stretch for them.There are a number of American actors, such as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman, who are known for an uncanny ability to transform themselves into the character they are playing. Dame Helen Mirren also has a repertoire of diverse roles, from Britain's current Queen Elizabeth to Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison. I don't think she ever played a comic assassin before, but again, it didn't seem a stretch. Again, not a criticism -- she is delightful in the part.Richard Dreyfuss is another actor who has a very diverse repertoire. (I don't understand why he was listed as far down in the credit order as he was, even though he has relatively little screen time.) In RED, he convincingly plays a mean and vicious villain.But it is the very versatile John Malkovich who steals this show! He plays paranoid retired agent Marvin Boggs. Sarah Ross (Parker) says of Boggs, 'Wow. This guy's insane.' Frank Moses (Willis) replies, 'Well, he thought he was the subject of a secret government mind control project. As it turns out, he really was being given daily doses of LSD for 11 years.' Ross (Parker) then says, 'Well in that case, he looks great. Yeah.' Malkovich perfectly portrays a character that fits that description. That's why I summarized my review as I did (taking it from that scene in the sci-fi film 'Being John Malkovich' where Malkovich causes what scientists call a 'singularity.')",9,0,0,16 February 2011
Up in the Air," Great photography
","Yes, the other reviewers are right about what the film is about, how well its acted, etc. I mean it WAS nominated for best picture, best actor in a leading role,best actress in a leading role, best supporting actress, best director, and best adapted screenplay. George Clooney was absolutely terrific, as was Vera Farmiga as people whose jobs keep them flying about the country like old-time traveling salesmen. I wasn't thrilled by the ending, but I really enjoyed the story.But I wanted to add that the cinematography, particularly the attention grabbing opening montage, was filmed and edited so beautifully that I thought it added much to my fascination with this film.",9,1,1,14 March 2016
