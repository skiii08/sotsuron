Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent addition to the Star Wars family
","This movie was ok the first time I saw it, but the second time it was great. I was not prepared for the Jar Jar character, and I probably payed too much attention to him - the next time around I was prepared, and the movie was much more balanced and thoroughly entertaining.  Is Phantom Menace as good as the originals?  Its really impossible to say - the original Star Wars transcended the screen and became a social phenomenon.  Phantom Menace can not and does not try to live up these standards - its impossible.  I think people have dumped on it because they expected a mystical experience - but as with many other movies, if you actively look for it you may miss it.  And don't forget that this move is part 1 of a new trilogy, who knows what Lucas has in store.  Would 'The Empire Strikes Back' have been considered a good movie if 'Jedi' hadn't followed it?  Before we reserve final judgement, lets see what George Lucas, a master storyteller, has to offer.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Black Hawk Down," Ok, but not great
","I can't figure out why people are going gaga over this movie.  From a technical standpoint, its solid.  The fighting scenes are exciting and well executed.  But beyond that, what is there to like?  There is no social context to speak of.  The characters are one-dimensional.  The story itself is frusturating and uninspiring.  I was hoping for something patriotic and uplifting, but got neither.",Null,0,0,31 January 2002
