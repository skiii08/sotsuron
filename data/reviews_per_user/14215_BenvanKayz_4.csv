The Longest Yard," different for a football movie
","This movie was a surprise to me. I was expecting another football comedy, with a few funny gags, but i was mistaken.Its actually surprisingly serious, sure it has its really funny moments, but i also noticed a lot of drama and sensitivity during the film, and i'm pretty sure thats a good thing. It gave the movie more appeal, to have the characters actually have emotions and goals, unlike most sport/comedy flicks.And also, the game play is presented brilliantly, with matrix style slow motion shots and really cool stunts, it gave the game a totally different outlook.And of course the movie is still a comedy, and it was funny.I recommend it to all sports movie fans and anyone who feels like watching something different than your typical football/comedy. 8/10",8,1,1,12 December 2005
Crash," so moving
","Crash is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. I loved every minute of it, and i believe that it did deserve to win the best picture award at the Oscars. So what if it was a little unrealistic, it still faced the issue of racism with bravery and passion, and in doing so, will move a very wide range of audiences.The film deals with the hardships of several different families and individuals all from different racial backgrounds and how they all connect with each other via a series of car crashes and crimes.It is beautifully made and wonderfully acted. The cast is absolutely brilliant. There were so many powerful moments during the film and I think many people will find it hard to hold back the tears.This film is not to be missed. 10/10",10,4,11,7 May 2006
Apocalypse Now," Horrible
","I watched this movie with my dad because he said it was one of the best movies he has ever seen, naturally i had high expectations because he usually has good taste in movies.By the end of the movie i felt so sick and depressed i don't think i could ever watch it again. It was extremely violent, extremely long, extremely boring, and extremely weird. It could almost be classified as a horror film, and its supposed to be a realistic war movie. But i suppose it's message is to show how horrible the Vietnam war was and how people can really do horrible things, so i will give it credit for that.It drags out for ages and never seems to have any storyline, just a few marines on a mission to find a crazy marine who thinks he is a god to a tribe. It is almost too violent but not in a gory way, but just horrible images of sacrifice and execution and brainwash. This film made me feel like crap. I don't know why so many people love it.I'm giving it 2/10 because it is not a very nice film to watch but it does manage to put across its message. I can only recommend it to war movie fans who like depressing films.",2,6,17,1 December 2005
Am√©lie," One of the best movies i have ever seen
","Amelie would have to be one of the best movies i have ever seen, i loved every moment of it.It is a feel good movie that really makes you feel good and i was laughing from start to finish and by the end of the film i just felt happy. Every character in the film has their own unique story and you just cant help but love them all, especially Amelie, who just has the ability to make everyone happy because she is always happy and doesn't care what anyone else thinks. Audrey Tautou is now one of my favorite actresses and this is the only film i have seen her in.This is one of those rare films that i can recommend to absolutely everyone. 10/10.",10,0,2,1 December 2005
