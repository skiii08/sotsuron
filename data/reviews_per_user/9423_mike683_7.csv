The Monuments Men," Take Off The Shroud To Be Enlightened
","As a young 'Army-brat', I was taken to the Acropolis of Athens in Greece, where I mindlessly viewed the site as a playground full of rubble for the tossing. Some years later, as a freshman needing credits in college, I enrolled in a History of Architecture class and with jaw agape I found myself thoroughly exploring what the Acropolis of Athens epitomized to humankind. Thus, I was enlightened.So, on a recent rainy afternoon, The Monuments Men unfolded on my smaller screen. As I read the movie's logline, it had never occurred to me just how much the world of art may well have lost during World War II. Once again, I was enlightened.The Monuments Men garnered my attention from opening credits, but the more story unfolded it was as if I too were uncovering a fantastic work of art. Yes, Monuments Men is not your typical WWII battlefield endeavor, but with an open mind you can still unearth the dramatic irony in aging art aficionados weaving their way through resistive warzone commands, while trying to get their collective assignments accomplished. Assignments that transitioned into affairs of the courageous heart, all the while leaving the audience with heart-wrenching passages of tragedy.Coming full circle, those same people who suffered through my childish antics on the Acropolis, would have been treated to similar escapades if they had also taken me to see a parched genre akin to The Monuments Men. However, I later realized the reasoning behind why my parents forced me to attend those protracted movies and to visit those tedious ancient sites, as such. Now, I thank my lucky stars they instilled that cultural foundation within me to nurture and I do so every day.To that end, give The Monuments Men its due. The storyline has appeared as a misfire to some, but the acting ensemble, the heroics portrayed, and the curatorial triumphs of perpetuation are very entertaining, let's just say, to those of us with a hint of cultural exposure.",8,0,1,27 December 2019
Just Go with It," OK at Matin√©e Prices
","I am a big Kidman fan, so that made me somewhat comfortable with seeing this cutesy movie with the wife. Too bad Nicole appears sparingly in this comedic folly. You would have to be from another planet in order to miss where this movie was going after three minutes in. The characters in this Happy Madison genre fumble through the standard romance format, all the while directing us toward the ultimate happy conclusion. There are some good cameos and some genuine laugh-out-loud moments, but not many. Take a date, buy some fresh popcorn, and try to remain interested in this ordinary, but tolerable yawner. Rating it a six was being generous.",6,0,4,14 February 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," More like Wall Street's Gordon Gekko wears Prada!
","Here's the apparent recipe for an Oscar nominating role stew: Take one driven mover-and-shaker, who unwillingly takes a chance on and hires a possible up-and-comer. Throw in one cute and likable underdog of a new employee, who is ill prepared for job at hand, but always seems to chameleon into a version of the boss. Insert some loved ones, who amazingly always notice the proverbial 'significant change in demeanor and radical departure' from the main character's normal life. Spice up the entire story with some wholesome new love interest that teeters on ending the disparaging old relationship. Bake this 'new conviction' concoction until the predictable reality sets in and the inevitable executive betrayal reaches a steamy boil. Then serve it with a sudden dose of ethical culpability and wash it down with an inevitable soul-searching resurgence back to normality. All the while knowing that someone, somewhere, somehow gets his or her dreams thoroughly trampled.Yes, Miranda Priestly, Gordon Gekko's fraternal twin, manipulates her way through the fashion magazine industry with the same cold brutality of a corporate raider dismantling a beloved company, and frankly, I loved every minute of it.And yes Ms. Streep, you better make room for yet another Oscar on your mantle!",8,0,0,16 July 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Again, I saw Bourne...Yesterday!
","The Borne Ultimatum has the same great storyline, same great actors, and same great chance there will be more Bourne. The movie collectively reveals a ton of missing pieces, neatly solves the puzzles we may have had, perpetuates the ever popular nonstop action pace, and typically leaves us wanting much, much more. This movie is a solid ten! Matt Damon now must be considered the new Bogart, Gable, Cooper, or Cagney. He continues to amaze, as he expands his mega-star resume from one hit to another. Suffice to say, he successfully takes us deeply again into the insane world of a dark and brooding Jason Bourne. You want him to survive, you want him to be personable, and damn it, you want him to jump on Nicky Parson's (Julia Stiles) bones. Alas, maybe next time.",10,0,1,5 August 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Flawed but good.
","I did not see a 'goof' submission area, so I feel compelled to comment on this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his escape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There in lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted, with his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to where it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that even the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never moved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area that was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which would have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and taping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would have had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's access off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as if Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled pipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have the section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to fit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to get through the pipe. The director would have been better off installing a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks spectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before the bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes and the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily changed in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was packing a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit to a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish he would pack for me on my trips!'Redemption' is a good movie, but not a great one.",5,2,7,12 February 2005
Apollo 13," Not a Bad Vehicle...Unlike the Service Module
","I have watched this movie over one hundred times, and I find it to be one of Ron Howard's best. From start to finish the viewer is taken on an ill-fated trip that conveys 'contingency' at its utmost. Survival is the name of the game and the film portrays the resilience of the entire space program to bring three astronauts' home. Howard sets the dramatic tone early with a front-loaded revisit to the tragic deaths of the Apollo 1 crew. It is a reminder and signifies the fragility of life as an astronaut.Howard effortlessly incorporates family and the behind the scenes skepticism of very engaged spouse played perfectly by Kathleen Quinlan. Her onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks, though limited, is infectious. Along with Hanks, Howard has an excellent ensemble of characters all of who offer insight into the multifaceted background of a space mission. Ed Harris delivers a gem of a performance and absolutely takes command of the film, as he steers the audience through the launch, the casualty and motivates the ground team to get the men home.Overall, my liking this movie centers on the vicarious nature and the 'what would I do' feel of the story. Howard's film keeps you firmly in space and presents the environmental conditions aptly, so the viewer indeed understands the harsh reality the Apollo 13 crew endures. In contrast, he reveals the circumstances with the families, where the stress, strain, and feelings of helplessness are poignantly unveiled.Alas, it is that emotional aspect that I also feel is lacking at the film's end. We see that the crew returns safely, we see the families react from afar, but after being subjected throughout the film to the intimate emotional swings of the families, one would love to have seen the inevitable and conceivably incredible reunions with loved ones. It is my impression that Ron Howard missed the boat on that omission. Thus, the movie gets 8 out 10 stars from me, but do not let that be an indication I feel it is not truly a 10.",8,0,1,15 December 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," I saw Bourne...yesterday
","Supremacy is an efficient sequel to 'The Bourne Identity'. The sophisticated talents of the cast supplement the stability of this action-packed series. I really love the way you vicariously live in Jason Bourne's shoes from the movie's beginning to end. The car chase scenes rival, if not exceed, other greats like in 'Bullitt' or 'The French Connection', and the hand-to-hand battles are first rate.It may not closely follow the Ludlum book, but director Paul Greengrass still manages to fit the pieces of this thriller together nicely. Overall, this movie is a pleasure for action movie lovers and I would definitely say it deserves it's nearly 8 point IMDb rating.",8,2,2,26 July 2004
