Ali," thank god for free libraries
","Otherwise I would have PAID to rent this. This fell into the category of 'an important' film. So I felt somehow OBLIGATED to watch it. You know? Cause I'm some white boy liberal (true) who wants to show my solidarity or whatever. But then, after an hour plus into it, I was thinking, man, I am NOT enjoying this crap. WHY am I watching it? I read a lot of the reviews in RottenTomatoes and many of them centered on the role of Jon Voight playing Howard Cosell. They all had nothing but praise to heap upon Jon Voight. So I started watching it for that reason but it was too little and too late. I ejected and watched my second choice movie. (HP and the SS) So sue me.",3,0,2,31 December 2006
Capote," oh just shut up, truman! Just shut up.
","who cares about this pathetic little man? I noticed in the Hated it section, one person found the first 30 minutes interesting and then everything after that boring. Strangely, my take was exactly the opposite. I was about to write it off but then Chris Cooper's part happened and the movie had a sudden infusion of energy. I like Hoffman as an actor but I like him when his own persona comes through, like it did in Scent of a Woman, Twister, Talented Mr. Ripley, etc. Obviously, making movies is ALL about the benjamins...let's face it. Playing somebody who actually lived is 10 times better than playing a fictional character. Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench played Queen Elizabeth and were nominated for best actress, Jim Carrey was nominated for playing Andy Kaufman, Robert Downey got his shot and blew it with Chaplin...the point is, those actors KNEW they were being given their dream shot. A license to print money. Once they get an Oscar, it's hello twenty million per picture while the rest of us slog along in our dreary lives sucking up to them, as if those people have any value. Their entire LIVES are based on non-real things. The smart ones become drug addicts and suicides. At least it shows they have some understanding of how pathetic they are. Capote did too, so he killed himself REAL SLOWLY by drinking himself to death. In fact, when they scanned his brain while he was still alive - if you can call those type of people alive - they found that it had LOST MASS! And there are still people EVERYWHERE who say that his lifestyle...nudge nudge, wink, wink...is perfectly acceptable. You know, whatever dude. Have fun encased in ice.",2,2,6,28 January 2007
