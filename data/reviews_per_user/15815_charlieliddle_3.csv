E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," More magical than Harry Potter
","E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is a magical film and one of the best movies Steven Spielberg has made. The acting is tremendous all- around. The kid acting is especially great. Drew Barrymore and Henry Thomas's performances are probably some of the best kid acting ever in a movie. Really the only other great kid actor I can think of is Haley Joel Osment for roles in The Sixth Sense, A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and many others. Everything you could want in a good family Spielberg movie is in E.T. There's great acting, smart writing, beautiful use of cinematography, good lighting with Spielberg's famous shadow work, an amazing musical score by John Williams, and, of course, there is plenty of memorable moments and what is often referred to today as the 'Spielberg magic'. The whole movie is a masterpiece, but I did find a few flaws that I tried to overlook but couldn't because they just brought down my enjoyment of the film too much. The first few minutes of the movie are really slow. There isn't dialogue for at least about five minutes in the film. Many people would say that that's a certain style that benefits the film. I wanted the movie to get to the point a little bit quicker, and I think the slightly longer exposition didn't help. There were a few other knit-picks here and there, but I won't get too deep into that.",9,9,12,11 April 2016
Zootopia," The best animated Disney film since Toy Story 3
","Zootopia is a great family-friendly, animated film. It has really good adult humor and is fun to watch from start to finish. The animation is really good, too. The idea of a movie where animals live and act like humans in an earth-like world is a great idea. Sometimes really good ideas for movies are just good ideas and don't really do that well on the big screen. Inside Out, for example, is a great idea for an animated movie, but, in my opinion, it didn't actually deliver. This is not the case for Zootopia. You will find yourself laughing out loud many times throughout. It's a very fun movie, and you should definitely check it out.",8,8,15,11 April 2016
The Martian," The best movie of 2015
","The Martian is a great film. Matt Damon gives one of the best performances of his career. The visuals are great and even the small things like costume and production design were on point. The movie is really funny. The entire film would be really dark the whole time (which it is at times) but with the constant humor throughout, the movie has an optimistic vibe. It does have its problems, though. I thought the movie was slow on occasion and definitely too long as a whole. I also wasn't that impressed by most of the acting. Other than Matt Damon, Michael Pe√±a, and maybe some of the NASA crew, the acting wasn't that good, and the dialogue didn't feel real. This was my second time seeing The Martian. I didn't think it was as good the second time. The main reason was probably that I didn't have the suspense that I did the first time I saw it. A lot of the enjoyment you'll get out of this movie is from not knowing what is going to happen and following Mark Watney and his journey of what to do next.",9,0,0,11 April 2016
