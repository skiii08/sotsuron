Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not the best.
","Wow.  It was visually thrilling, and I liked the story, but it was way too predictable.  It needed some more twists, and it really needed a giant space battle.  Besides that, it was quite enjoyable, and I recommend it to everyone out there.  It was definitely way better than Titanic, which IMHO was kind of lacking in the interest department.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
