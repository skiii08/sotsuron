Scarface," Some of Al Pacino's Finest Acting - and That's Saying Something!
","Scarface is one of those films that you just have to see. The story of Tony Montana, a Cuban who after being refused entry to the US, manages to get a green card through a slightly less legitimate route (killing a man), and once in the US will stop at nothing to work his way to the top of an empire built on blood and cocaine. It is a tale of greed, power, ambition, money with a slightly moral aspect - possessions don't buy you happiness.Al Pacino is incredible in this - the character of Tony Montana is unforgettable, and despite being such a brutal, cold-hearted killer Montana comes across as endearing to the viewers - you at once think he's cool, envy him his success, whilst pity him the fact that though he has everything he in fact has nothing at all. Michelle Pfeiffer also gives an unforgettable performance as Elvira Hancock, though Manny River could have been far better cast than Steven Bauer in my opinion, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had so much potential with Gina that was left un-found.This type of film is not for everyone - plenty of murder, drugs and swearing, yet it is just one of those films that you have to watch at least once. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Al Pacino is incredible, and his portrayal of Tony Montana will probably remain one of my favourite pieces of acting ever. If you haven't seen it, buy the DVD asap! You're missing out!!",9,0,1,4 October 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not As Funny As People Like To Make Out
","I'd heard nothing about this film before watching it other than the general consensus that it was one of the funniest films that many had ever seen in their life, so obviously I went in with high expectations that couldn't fail but be disappointed. It's not that the film isn't funny, because it is when you're in the right mood and with the right group of friends, but its not clever, witty humour like I was expecting, instead it was an invitation to laugh at Ali G making an idiot of himself for an hour and a half. I know there are many complaints about the sexist + racist comments made in the film, but come on, the films not discriminating against certain racial groups, it's discriminating against just about everyone and everything! Not a film to watch if you like movies with any substance, pretence at a plot, decent script, good acting, ladidaa, but something to see if you need a cheap laugh and something to discuss with your friends the next day. Watch it at least once in your life, just don't expect a masterpiece.",5,2,4,4 October 2008
Antz," Deserves More Recognition!
","I loved this film as a kid, and am glad that it hasn't lost any of it's magic now that I've grown up a bit! I'd assume this film gets many comparison's with Pixar's 'A Bug's Life', well, don't tell them I told you so, but I actually think Antz has the edge over that film. (at least the actual ants has the right number of legs for one thing!). The animation is faultless, the story line suitable for both a younger and older audience, there's characters you love, and others you love to hate, and a feel good message at the end of it all - don't be afraid to dream, and if we all stick together, we can achieve anything. Great film!",8,0,0,4 October 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Primarily a Love Story - The Shakespeare Thing is Just an Extra
","I guess the biggest fault you can find in this film is that the story of E.T. is more likely to have been true than the love affair portrayed in 'Shakespeare in Love'. But as the film never once claims to be historically accurate, then I can't really complain about this and instead will take the film for what it is - a love story with a twist! The story goes that William Shakespeare is having writer's block and needs inspiration to help write his next play (which will end up being Romeo & Juliet). While watching the auditions for the part of Romeo, Shakespeare is dazzled by the talent of one boy - who turns out to actually be the beautiful Viola De Lesseps who has auditioned under the disguise of a man as women were not allowed to be actors in Shakespeare's day. Here starts the love story between William and Viola, finally giving Shakespeare the inspiration he needs to write Romeo and Juliet.The script is full of jokes and references that people who have studied Shakespeare will appreciate, but there's also plenty for the non-fans too to keep you occupied. Jospeh Fiennes did an OK job as Shakespeare but he was over-shadowed by not only Gwyneth Paltrow as Viola (I've never been a fan of Shakepeare but when she read his poems and speeches I fully understood the meaning of his words), and especially by Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. What I especially liked was the ending to the story, which was not what I had expected to finally happen (but I guess, is more true to Shakespeare's life).A good film, but not great. I look forward to watching it again.",6,0,0,4 October 2008
The Notebook," Beautiful love story, but by no means perfect
","After putting off watching this film for many years, I finally bought the DVD earlier this year and decided to lose my 'the Notebook virginity' and take the plunge - now I have seen this film way more many times than I care to count, and am still loving every moment of it.The story revolves around Allie Hamilton, a fun loving, hard-working, 17 year old girl from a very rich family, who, during a summer holiday at Seabrook, falls deeply in love with Noah Calhoun, a poor boy who loves her back with all his heart. But summer romances cannot last forever and eventually Allie's mother, Anne Hamilton, decides to interfere, telling her daughter that she was not born and brought up to waste her life on trash like Noah. The family leave the next day and return to the city, and although Noah writes to Allie everyday for the next day, not one of the 365 letters reached Allie because her mum, Anne, would hide them away. Eventually, believing all is over between her and Noah, Allie falls in love with the rich, intelligent and successful Lon Hammond Jr, and agrees to marry him, but her destiny was inter wined with Noah's, and it won't let her escape that easy.The film is a romance, but whilst that category often induces terms such as 'cheesy, soppy, predictable, clich√©d' etc, 'the Notebook' breaks every one of them and gives a refreshing and different account of a story told too many times over for many, many years. The script is incredibly well written (except for a few awkward parts) considering it's genre, and the parts acted brilliant by all involved. Stand out performance must go to Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen (as Allie and her mother), although Ryan Gosling, James Marsden, David Thornton and Starletta DuPois probably all deserve a mention too.(slight spoilers in this paragraph) One of my main faults with this film is that the Noah we see in the present time (the old Noah) is a completely different person to the Noah we see in the story. There are no similarities between the two characters, except for their undying love for Allie, and although I understand that this may be to prevent the first time viewers from guessing the ending, it also takes away from the film by making it seem far less genuine.I do love this film, but it is by no means one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautiful tale of love, and the film grows on you and continues to surprise you on subsequent viewings 9which really is the mark of a good film), but being in the genre of romance it is rather limited, and although a very heart-warming and sad story, it will not be one to change the face of the film industry for years to come, but instead will be a film that many will enjoy, though no one could claim it to be the greatest film ever to be made.",6,1,2,4 October 2008
Spider-Man 3," MUCH better the second time round!
","When I first saw this film in the cinema I was disappointed as were many fans, the latest instalment of the Spider-Man films just didn't live up to the two previous ones, and that was saying something as I didn't even like the 2nd film! But I watched this again last night, over a year from when I saw it originally and have to say - it's a pretty darn good film! All the faults I found with it initially seemed to vanish - the 'emo bad boy Peter' scene was cringe worthy, but made me laugh out loud rather than hang my head with embarrassment. There were too many bad guys in this film, but the Sandman was no longer a boring side plot leading up to the fight with Venom that was all that most fans seemed interested in - it was an interesting story in it's own right (though still with it's plot-holes - how did the locket survive when everything else was obliterated?!). Happy Peter Parker at the beginning too wasn't just a weird turn in the story either - it made sense, fit in with the rest of the plot, with MJ and Peter's arguments, it all linked in together and was for the greater good of the story. Overall, it was such an improvement it felt like an entirely different film, though of course it wasn't - my expectations were just a lot lower.I've always thought the chemistry between the main three friends, MJ, Harry and Peter, was fantastic when they were all together. James Franco (Harry Osborn) and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane Watson) especially seem to have a genuine chemistry which shines through the screen. However, scenes alone between Dunst and Maguire felt awkward and forced - I'm not sure whether it was purely in this film that this has happened or whether it was the same in previous films but I just hadn't noticed, but considering they are the main couple of the films it is surprising and definitely something to work on for future Spider-Man productions.Finally, the last 40 minutes or so of the films - the final battle - is probably one of my favourite movie endings ever - I won't say anything that may spoil it but it's definite eye candy and will have you on the edge of your seat, even if like me you've already seen it once before.",7,2,3,4 October 2008
Zodiac," Interesting
","I don't know much about the case of Zodiac outside of this film, so I can't really comment on how close to the truth the story of this film is, or how well each person played their part in comparison to their real-life counterpart. However, I can comment on this film for what it is - a fascinating story of a cartoonist's search for the identity of a serial killer who all else seem to have given up on ever finding.The pacing of the film is slow, but if I'm honest, that's the type of pacing that I prefer, where the director lets things build up rather than adopting the 'thrill-a-second' approach that certain directors have taken with their films lately. The acting was good - I'm usually a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal but I wasn't really blown away by his performance in this film - it was OK, he played his part, but I didn't really connect with the character at any point. I was impressed by Robert Downey Jr, who plays a believable Paul Avery, but my favourite performance of the film by far was by Mark Ruffalo as David Toschi - he really made the character his own.The plot is interesting, but of course limited due to being based on real life case. I've heard people complain that the ending is unsatisfactory as we never 'really' find out who the Zodiac killer is - only who he 'probably' is, but I'm pleased the film chose to stay true to the facts rather than adopt a more Hollywood 'all loose strings tied' approach. I can't really pick any faults with this film, the acting is great, the script is faultless, the direction brilliant, but I've still given it four stars instead of five because, although there's nothing really wrong with it, it's still missing a certain something that makes it extra special. Some films have it, some don't, and sadly this film falls into the latter category. But that's not to say this is a bad film at all - in fact, it is a very good one - just not the greatest.",7,1,2,4 October 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Nowhere Near As Good As Some Reviewers Would Have You Think
","This is the fourth collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton I have seen (the previous three being Sweeney Todd, the Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands) and I can say without an instance's doubt that it is easily the worst of the four. In fact, if it were not for Johnny Depp, then I would have stopped watching half an hour in to this poor excuse for a film.Lets me quickly outline the plot. Constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) has been called to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the unusual murders of certain town folk, where they have had their head cut clean from their body. The town widely believe that the murders are being carried out by a headless horseman, but Crane is doubtful and wants to investigate further.Sound good? Trust me, the film's nowhere near that interesting. What I found really hard to get over was - what was this film meant to be exactly? The soundtrack would have you believe it's a scary horror - as would all the blood, headless corpses, skulls, torture weapons, y'know what I'm talking about, anything to build up atmosphere and suspense. But it fails, because this film just isn't scary, it isn't even gory (the blood looks ridiculously fake), in fact, I'd say it was Burton's aim to make us laugh, except there aren't even any jokes in the film. The special effects are just plain weird, and apart from Depp and Miranda Richardson the acting on whole is pretty dire. Christina Ricci may look the part but she cannot act, and the two child actors are just as dire (as is Lisa Marie as Ichabod's mother). It's surprising for a film to have so many badly acted parts, and I can only put this down to the fact that actors were chosen for appearance first, and acting skills second. Well, whatever the reason, one things for sure - whoever was in charge of the auditions seriously messed up.Another problem of mine with 'Sleepy Hollow' is how hard it is to follow what the hell is going on. Ichabod Crane seemed to come to conclusions regarding the investigation as if from nowhere (Oh look, a chemical reaction, the head was cut off in a single blow. This women was pregnant, the murderer must be a mad-man (you don't say!). Oh look, a tree with decapitated heads stored inside - this must be a portal to hell). Whaaaat?! Does Burton really assume that his audience is too thick to realise how ridiculous this logic is? I am really disappointed in this film. It was nothing like what I had expected, and a huge let down compared to the quality of other Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films. Do not be led astray by all these 5 star reviews - watch this film if you really want to, just don't expect the greatest film in the world. Or anything close.",2,17,31,4 October 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Good, But Not Great
","I'm afraid I'm in the minority here but after watching Pan's Labyrinth tonight I've got to say, I was incredibly disappointed. I mean, there's nothing wrong with the film itself, it's an interesting, clever and dark story of how a young girl copes with her grief via fantasy's, set in the fascist Spain of 1944. What I found that let the film down was reading and hearing all these brilliant reviews of how this film was one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years, nay, one of the greatest films EVER created. And that was my problem - it was a good film, but it wasn't brilliant, and after expecting so much more, I felt hollow at the end of this film, like I'd been cheated out of an incredible movie.The story follows 11 year old Ofelia, who's mother is pregnant and has recently married Captain Vidal, a brutal, cruel, abusive and unfeeling army man who is only interested in his new wife because of the baby she is carrying in her womb. Ofelia's mother is ill, and the country is in the middle of civil war, and Ofelia, to escape the brutality and cruelty of real life, creates a fantasy in her head where she is the princess and if she completes three tasks set to her by the faun, then she will be able to go to the world where her 'real' father is, and leave this horrible world behind. I've got to say, the imagination of the film is incredible - the story is beautiful -, the script is good (what was translated of it at any rate), and the acting is superb, but my issue was that I never really connected with any of the characters emotionally (the dramatic end didn't really move me at all), and that the world Ofelia creates for herself is too childish and silly for me to ever get drawn in to it's story. I feel like I have to mention Serji Lopez on account of his performance as Captain Vidal, which really was quite superb, and I also believe the director Guillermo del Toro did a great job with the film. Hence the three stars. But overall I didn't fall in love with this movie, and although I may watch it again if it is on the TV, I won't be recommending it highly to my friends, or rushing out to buy the DVD because I just HAVE to see it again. A good movie, not great, - just don't go in expecting a masterpiece. That way you may enjoy it far more than I have.",6,3,7,4 October 2008
10 Things I Hate About You," The Teen Flick of My Generation
","I'm 19 now (so was only 9 when '10 Things I Hate About You' came out) and I have seen this film way too many times to count. There have been countless sleep-overs, film days, random get-togethers and quite evenings alone that have all featured this film, so much so that I can now pretty much recite the entire script off by heart. Yet it is a mark of just how great this film is that, despite knowing it inside out I can still sit down and watch it and thoroughly enjoy doing so - it is and always will remain one of my favourite films.When I was younger I never questioned anything in the films I watched - it is only as I have grown up that I have learnt to be critical of films, books and music, and even now, I can't fault any of the acting in '10 Things I hate About You'. Heath Ledger gives a dazzling performance as usual (which is surprising considering how reluctant Ledger was to take the part in case he became typecast) but the real breath-taking performance for me was by Julia Stiles - it is only now I am older that I can appreciate just how believably she managed to pull off her character that you do not for an instance question whether she is the 'rude, aggressive, bitter older sister of the most popular girl at school who only behaves in this way as a defence mechanism'. The remainder of the cast, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik, David Krumholtz etc all play their parts perfectly, and with a true 90's script and killer soundtrack this film couldn't fail to be anything but a success.I guess that part of the appeal of this film for me is the fact that I grew up through my teenage years constantly watching it. If I was to be introduced to this film for the first time today, I am not sure whether I would like it anywhere near as much as I do now, but it has a certain sentimental value for me, and brings back many, many memories. And I have to say, in this genre of film, '10 Things I hate About You' will always come out on top. I guess that this film is my generations High School Musical, however, there is one key difference in my opinion - although this may be a teen chick flick it is in a class of it's own quality wise, and definitely should not be disregarded as anything less. Love it!!",8,11,13,4 October 2008
The Aviator," Watch this more for learning than for entertainment
","Before watching this film I knew nothing about Howard Hughes, about aviation, had no idea what this film was about other than a biography, when it was set, had never even seen a trailer. Yet, I had heard many positive reviews and curious to see what all the fuss was about I finally got around to watching the film, and was not disappointed I did.As I said before, I knew nothing previously about Howard Hughes so this film was interesting to me just to find out about the man, about his eccentricities, his obsession with perfection, his his constant strive towards the future. Leonardo DiCaprio was believable (though how similar he was to the real Howard Hughes I cannot comment), as was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn (in fact, I'd say Blanchett's performance was some of the best acting I have seen in a long time).The film isn't exciting, fun, it doesn't even capture the viewer and keep them enthralled in the story. It is long, and I often began to think 'is this film actually going ANYHWERE?' but it is worth a watch, especially if you're interesting in Howard Hughes, or if not, if you enjoy biographical films, or even interested in Hollywood at the time. I'm glad I watched it purely to find out about the man, but it is dark, and will leave viewers with a dark feeling looming over them, and I don't think I'd like to watch it again in a hurry. It is a brave film, some of the scenes seemed incredibly risky but were pulled off well, but there isn't really much more to say - I won't rave and say it was one of the best things I've ever watched, because it isn't, but it does deserve recognition (far more than it's had if I'm honest) and is a good piece of work. Give it a go, just don't expect to be overwhelmed.",6,2,4,4 October 2008
American Beauty," A Seriously Messed Up View On Life...
","...But worryingly accurate at the same time. American Beauty is about Lester Burnham, a middle-ages man stuck in a marriage with a wife who he hates and a daughter who hates him. He feels ignored, under-appreciated,as if he is simply walking through life playing out the part, no emotions involved, never feeling anything. Then he meets his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes, and the new kid next door, Ricky Fits, and inspired by both decides to start living again. Within a month he winds up dead.What is so haunting about this film is that it is real - the characters, the emotions, the love and hatred - it's all taken from real life, everyone's experienced these things before, everyone knows someone who behaves like Carolyn, or Jane, or Frank etc. It is so bizarre to see this portrayed on film, blatant for all to see, when usually people try to hide the darker side of real life, either making cushy love stories, films about gangs and crime, or un-realistic horror films to scare people instead. The thing is, real life is so much darker.The acting from all concerned is faultless. Kevin Spacey plays Lester to perfection - the viewer understands exactly what Lester is going through, you are on his side even if his actions are not what you would find morally correct. Annette Bening is incredible as Carolyn - you truly believe she is this insane, power-hungry perfectionist, and most importantly, at the end, you also truly believe that she did love her husband, despite everything. Wes Bentley played Ricky to the right level of creepy, still allowing the audience to connect with him, and Thora Birch and Mena Suvari play the two girls to perfection - unlike certain films that portray teenagers in a completely unrealistic way you could actually believe these girls were attending high school, their behaviour and speech was spot on.This film is dark, sick, twisted, yet the ending is hopeful too (you'll know what I mean if you watch it). One of the greatest films of our time - a film to inspire you, as well as make you sit back and think, what kind of life are we living here. A must see!",9,0,3,4 October 2008
Edward Scissorhands," One of those films you'll be thinking about for days afterwards
","This film is odd. Think of Desperate Housewives. Think of Pinnochio. Think lame love triangle. Think tortured genius. Then mix in Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, and you've got yourself an incredibly moving film you just won't be able to get out of your head for days afterwards. I don't know enough about this film to give it full justice in a review, but I will say that I put off watching this film for many years, and probably would have for many years more had my friend not lent me the DVD, and that's a choice I highly regret. A must see film for everybody, yes it's odd, quirky + off-beat but it's humour and heart and also undeniable. Excellent.",7,1,1,4 October 2008
Save the Last Dance," All dance films seem to follow the exact same formula, but this one stands out as one of the best
","I think the title pretty much sums up what I'm going to say in this review. I finally got around to watching 'Save the Last Dance', becoming quite tired of the 'How can you not have seen 'Save the Last Dance', it's the best dance film out there!' comments each time the film came up in conversation. And yes, I enjoyed it, it was a good, entertaining film, but it definitely was not one of the greatest things ever created and I don't think it deserves quite as much hype as it receives.The story line has become a clich√© by now, girl and boy become romantically involved against a backdrop of dancing. I think that this was one of the first dance films of it's kind though, and you can almost feel that throughout the movie - it feels fresh and original, not like a carbon copy of an already done and dusted formula (such as 'How She Move' felt). Also, I think it's important to mention how influential this film was in encouraging more dance films to be made, some of them rather good too, like Step Up 1 + 2, Take the Lead, etc. However, by now the formula wears thin, and has been done too many times, so even whilst this film was one of the first in it's genre, a viewer watching this for the first time these days already knows what will happen at the end less than 10 minutes into the film, and that's definitely a let down (though, it's hardly a fault that the movie could have prevented, without foresight).The dancing is not the greatest I have ever seen in this genre of film, that would have to go, hands down, to the street-dancing in Step Up 2 (and I do believe that the ballet in Step Up 1 probably deserves second place) but it is good enough for the film, and definitely not the worse I have seen. In fact, Sara's final dance may be one of my favourite routines ever seen on film. I was very surprised to discover Julia Stiles was such a capable, and very skilled ballet dancer - her dancing impressed me far more than her acting in this film (which, although wasn't necessarily bad, was more of her same old style - it's as if she plays the same person in each role, who just happens to be in a completely new situation each time). Kerry Washington also impressed me as the confident, mouthy, and good at heart Chenille and I believe Sean Patrick Thomas also deserves a mention as Derek, as does Fedro Starr as Malakai.Overall, I did like this film, it was fast paced, intelligent, easy watching, and a welcome change to the recent films I have been watching lately which all feel much slower, and emotionally heavy. However, the plot gives this film it's limitations, and although for it's genre it is up there with the best, it's not a film that I would say deserves to be forever remembered in film history. But that again, there are only a few that do.",6,2,4,4 October 2008
Spirited Away," I Liked It, But Not As Much As I Thought I Would
","There are plenty of reviews on here saying how great this film is and explaining it's story so I won't do any of that here. I watched this film dubbed in English, so it may have lost some of the magic that certain films only have in their original language, but that still couldn't take away from the actual story in front of me which, if I'm honest, I didn't think was great enough to deserve all these 5 stars. Once you get passed the sheer absurdness of the whole thing, the film is enjoyable and very funny, but that's about it, I wasn't left with any feeling of enlightenment, or that i'd just witnessed one of the greatest films ever made. It's a cute film but that's it really. I'd like to see it again, because I really do wonder whether I've missed something that all these reviewers seem to have seen, but I can't really recommend this film as one of the greatest I've ever seen, because it just isn't. Good for fans of anime. For everyone else, approach with caution.",6,3,7,4 October 2008
P.S. I Love You," Pleasantly Surprised
","Although I have always meant to get around to it, I have never read the book P.S I Love You, so I didn't really have any preconceptions of what this film was about, what the characters should have been like, or any changes to the actual storyline. Perhaps that's one of the reasons I love this film so much (I know that fans of the book are not so keen on the film), and in my experience, films based on books will never fail to disappoint, unless of course the viewer hasn't read the book first.As you can tell by the 5 star rating, I loved this film, and I really wasn't expecting to! Reading the story line, I thought this would be dull, boring, full of moaning, grief and tears, no real action, full of the complaining of a mourning widow which, to be honest, didn't really interest me. But the film is so much more than that. From the opening scene where you see Holly and Gerry fighting, yet still feel their strong love beneath it you get a sense of what this film is about - real love, not the fairy tale type you see in most films, but real, genuine love despite knowing each others faults, and what to do once you have your 'fairy tale', but your prince charming dies and you're forced to go out into the real world again.Hilary Swank's performance was faultless, she really conveyed the emotion Holly was feeling to the viewers and was incredibly appealing as a character, not making Holly too miserable at all. Gerard Butler wasn't in this film as much as I would have liked, but his parts where played incredibly well, though there wasn't really much to Gerry's character to play, mostly a lovable, loving, funny, warm, Irish guy. I wasn't a fan of Lisa Kudrow as Denise, but having not read the book am not sure whether that was what Denise's character was really like, or whether Kudrow just portrayed her poorly. Finally, Harry Conick Jr as Daniel deserves a mention too, and I would have liked to see more Daniel and Holly scenes.I feel like this film is perfect in many ways, though there are a couple scenes I wasn't a fan of. The one that springs to mind was the sex scene between Holly and William. The film had kept my attention without fail the entire way through, but the 10-15 minutes where the three girls get stranded on the lake to where William is telling Holly story's about Gerry were at least in my opinion, a bit flat and weird, and I felt the film would have been better without them.Overall though, I really do love this film. Maybe not for the fans of the books, but for everyone else, especially fans of chick-flicks, give this one a shot, but don't be put off by the thought of it just being a chick flick as it's so much more, heart-warming + heart breaking at the same time, it's funny, intelligent, and a beautiful story. One I won't forget in a hurry.",8,0,0,4 October 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part of the Greatest Story Ever Told
","I truly believe that 'the Lord of the Rings' is one of the greatest stories ever told. The tale of Frodo Baggins and the ring of power continues in the second part of the trilogy, where Frodo and Sam are continuing their relentless quest to Mordor to destroy the ring, only to be joined by the sinister yet pitiable creature known as Gollum. Meanwhile, Merry & Pip try their hardest to escape from the evil orcs who captured them at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', whilst Gimley, Legolas and Aragorn meet a king and immediately sense something is not right. Old characters return and new ones are introduced as the tale of the Ring grows closer to it's end.The extended edition is far superior to the original, though the amount of time it takes to watch borderlines on ridiculous. there are many (necessary) explanations and more focus on various story arcs. I was especially pleased at the extra focus on Arwen and Aragorn, one of the main stories to hold my interest.As with the 1st of the films, each shot, every scene is spectacular to watch, and as the viewer you never question the integrity of this fantasy world - for a few hours you truly are transported into this world, the characters do exist, the elves, dwarfs, orcs, ents and hobbits are all real. The soundtrack is breathtaking and the acting is superb - the characters all look and sound the part and the script is infallible. I don't really have any complaints, except (as I mentioned earlier) for the length of the film, but as this is the extended edition, and that no matter how long this film is it never once feels boring, all is forgiven on my part and I sincerely look forward to watching 'the Two Towers' again. This is how film adaptations from books are meant to be done. Those responsible for the Harry Potter and Narnia films would do to take heed and learn from the master.",9,0,2,4 October 2008
Stardust," A fairy tale to make you believe in fairy tales again
","I've had this film recommended to me far too many times to count, but have always found an excuse to put off watching it - I've got exams coming up I must revise for, I'm going out tonight and need to get ready, I don't have the money to spend on DVDs at the moment. However, I found this in Woolworths for ¬£8 a few days back, and having no other plans to keep me occupied I decided to buy it and finally see what all the fuss was about.The story follows Tristan (the result of a one night stand his father had with a imprisoned princess he met across the wall), who, in attempt to capture the heart of the girl he thinks he's in love with, promises to cross the wall to find a fallen star and bring it back to her before her birthday (time limit - 7 days). What he doesn't count on however was that the star would be a person, ad that darker forces were also after her and her necklace with far more sinister intentions.He also didn't realise that he may just fall in love with her.It's a classic fairy tale, witches, princes, heroes and heroines, but whether it's because I've been out of touch with fairy tales these past few years, or due to something special in regards to the film and the story, I really enjoyed watching Stardust, and became swept along with the story - I especially liked the idea of the falling star being a person, capable of falling in love.The character of Tristan is incredibly lovable, and you find yourself rooting for him right from the start. Charlie Cox portrayed the character brilliantly, believably, allowing the viewers to connect with this unlikely (so therefore rather typical) hero. Although Clare Danes looked the part of a star, I failed to be impressed with her portrayal of Yvaine, and wondered whether they could have made her character even slightly more likable, and believable. But my favourite performance by far belongs to Michelle Pfieffer as Lamia. There's not much I can say really to capture how brilliantly Pfieffer portrays this character, but this is one of the classic cases were you really can't tell an actors playing a role at all, but believe the performance totally.The film isn't really anything special or unique, its a classic story, it's fun, it's scary (for the kids), it's entertaining - yet, it really works, perhaps because it ticks all the boxes of a classic fairytale. Make no mistake, this isn't one to remain in people's lists of top 10 films for years to come, but I am glad to have finally watched Stardust and would recommend to everyone to at least give it a try. There's a certain charm this film possesses, and I found, that at least for a little while, I was transported back to being a kid again, swept away with the story, rooting for the hero to win, the villain to lose, and the guy to finally get the girl.",7,0,1,4 October 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I Can't Get This One Out Of My Head
","I watched this film over two days ago, and have found it increasingly difficult to think of anything else since. An unassuming, honest, off-beat, film , 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of those movies that will grow on you and make you want to watch it time and time again, and is intelligent and thought-provoking enough to keep you captivated on repeated viewings.Boasting none of the usual Hollywood glitz, though the cast list is definitely something to show off about, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' follows the shy, quite and often seemingly 'boring' Joel Barish, who, after dating a girl called Clementine for several years visits her one day, only to discover she has no recollection of who he is and has in fact had him intentionally and entirely erased from her memory. Joel, distraught, hurt and confused, visits the place where Clementine had her memories of him erased and chooses to do the same to his memories of her. However, once made unconscious so the procedure could occur, he re-lives each of the memories as the team (Patrick, Frank, Stan and Mary) are trying to erase them, and suddenly decides that this may not really be what he wants. As the viewer we are given the chance to see Clem and Joel's relationship through these memories, how they met, the good times, the bad, why Clem finally decided she no longer wanted to have Joel as part of her life - or memory. And we also watch as Joel discovers that he doesn't, in fact, want to erase Clem from his life forever, and we sit at the edge of our seat willing Joel to find a way to keep his memories safe forever.I think 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a brilliant film, probably my second favourite film I have ever watched (the first being' A Beautiful Mind'). However, I do realise it's limitations too. It feels like a low budget movie (whether it is or not I do not know) despite boasting many Hollywood stars in the cast list. However, I feel that this definitely adds to the movie rather than takes away from it - it gives the film a sense of character, of individuality, as well as fitting the story well - for neither of the main characters live a glamorous life, so for the film to be filmed in that style would have been untrue to itself. Another limitation some may note would be the actual story - the idea of having a person fully erased from your memory is absurd, however, like certain other science-fictional stories I have seen or read (such as the novel, 'The Time Traveller's Wife') the absurdity of the idea comes second to the story, and the message of the story. The film is set in the real world, in our time, so it is easy to forget that memories cannot just simply be erased, and instead, as the viewer you pay attention to the story, and what the film is trying to ultimately say.The acting in this film is superb. Jim Carrey (who I have only ever seen in comedic roles previously) makes a breathtaking transformation into a serous role as Joel Barish, pulling off the character of a quite, shy loner with far more integrity and skill than I would have ever believed possible. Kate Winslet too made a startling change in my eyes from the only other role I'd seen her in (Rose in Titanic) to the gritty, fun-loving, unique, emotional, impulsive and incredibly chatty Clementine, who's ever-changing bright coloured hair makes the passage of time in the film slightly easier to follow. I think my favourite performance however was by Mark Ruffalo as Stan, and this is the second time Ruffalo has blown me away with a role and he will certainly be someone who I will keep my eye on in the future - he is an incredibly gifted actor.I don't want to say too much about this film as I don't want to give much away. I will say though that the final scenes were very emotionally powerful (which surprised me)and that, although the film is only about an hour and a half in length, the character development throughout makes it feel like you have known the main two characters, Joel and Clem, for many years, and you end up caring for them as you would for two good friends, wanting them both to be happy. The film worked enough to have me willing Joel to hide his memory's from the 'evil' eraser team, to remember Clem, and go back to her and make her remember him too, but whether that happens or not I will not say - you'll just have to watch and see. All I will say is that there are a few surprises that I defiantly was not expecting, that this film is not as predictable as you may expect, it being a love story and all.",10,2,4,4 October 2008
Rocky," They Just Don't Make Films Like This Anymore
","I'm not a fan of boxing, so I put off watching this film for a long time as I was under the false impression that that was all that Rocky was about - boxing. How very wrong I was. Although boxing is one of the main story lines in the movie, it is definitely not the only one, with many other story arcs, themes, and ideas that were better suited to my interests.Sylvester Stallone gives an incredible, unforgettable performance as Rocky Balboa, a small time boxer who is given the chance to fight the heavy weight champion. The character is warm, likable, funny, and Stallone really brings Rocky alive. Talia Shire likewise does a fantastic job as Adrian (Rocky's incredibly shy girlfriend), in fact, I can't think of a single bad performance in the entire film.There's character development, there's a love story, there's some characters you will love and others who you'll hate. You never feel cheated when watching this film - the script, the acting, the story, the soundtrack, there is not one bad aspect to pick out, but many, many good ones. It's a heart warming, family film that everyone should try and watch at least once.",9,0,0,4 October 2008
The Untouchables," Brilliantly Made, But Not A Classic
","I watched this film for the first time today, oblivious as to what it was about and only interested in it because of the rave reviews I'd heard. Well, it definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but it was very good none the less. Set in the 1930s when alcohol was illegal in the US, Al Capone is the Crime Lord trading the stuff for masses of money, and Eliot Ness, the federal Agent who is determined to bring him down. I wasn't particularly blown away by any of the acting, I guess Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness is worth a mention, but although each character played their part well none of them stood out or really made the character their own. What does deserve a mention however is the style in which the Untouchables was filmed - lots of weird camera angles and shots, lots of dramatic music, all building up suspense, tension, fear, excitement, sadness, etc. The viewer gets sucked into this film, as long as they have the patience to sit through the first 30 or so minutes until it gets really interesting.A good film, very well made, but not one I'd be quick to recommend to friends or want to watch again in a hurry. Watch, but don't expect to be blown away.",5,1,6,4 October 2008
The Departed," Let Down By The Ending
","Up until the last 15 minutes or so I was prepared to give The Departed a 10/10 rating and put it on my list of favourite films ever. I liked everything about this film - the plot, the script, the acting etc. But then the last 15 minutes meant this film finished on such a depressing and dire note that simply left me feeling hollow, and made the film seem a little bit more than pointless.Character development is something that really shines out in The Departed. Billy Costigan is a cop who is pretending to work for Costello, the head of the Irish mafia, but is in fact a rat and giving information to the cops. Colin is working for the cops but is in fact giving information to Costello behind the backs of all the Police. Costello knows he has a rat in his midst. So do the police. Question is, will either ever find out who? Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Billy Costigan is not only faultless - it's really quite superb. Gone are DiCaprio's days as an actor purely know for his pretty face - it is clear from this performance that not only does the man know how to act, but acts very, very well - I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more of DiCaprio's later work. Matt Damon as Colin was less impressive for me, but the remainder of the cast cannot be faulted, especially Mark Wahlberg as Dignam - his part may have been small but was definitely memorable.Martin Scorsese did a fantastic job directing this film - he really knows how to create drama and atmosphere - and the contrasting shots of Billy and Colin all through out worked incredibly well and showed Scorsese's skill as a director.I've got to question the name of the film though, 'The Departed', which really doesn't suit what this film is about and was one of the reasons I put off watching it for so long. But I'm defiantely glad I had finally got around to watching it, and surprised at all the poor reviews this film has got. Definitely worth a watch, just make sure you have plenty of time on your hands.",7,0,1,4 October 2008
Step Up," Films like this make me wish I went to dance school
","I only watched this film after seeing Step Up 2 in the cinema, and first off was rather surprised that there was a complete change of characters in the two films (except for Tyler, who was present in Step Up 2 at the start). The film itself is really enjoyable to watch - make no mistake, it's not worth an Oscar and most likely will not last the decades and remain in peoples DVD collections for years to come, but it's entertaining to watch, and much better than flicking through the TV channels aimlessly for hours in an attempt to find anything half decent to watch.It's a typical boy meets girl story, but with a twist. Girl is a ballerina that needs a replacement dance partner, boy is working in the school doing community service, and just happens to be the only one up for the task. The choreography is good (not a patch on Step Up 2 however, though that may be because I prefer watching street dancing over ballet) and the acting is believable. Although the story has been done many times before, it's one of those classical tales that can be re-watched many times in a variety of forms. The female lead (do not know the actors name) is a wonderful dancer and a beautiful actress, and the male lead managed to pull off his part incredibly well.A must watch for those who enjoy dancing and a good old love story. It's one of my favourite films, though be warned, this won't be everyone's cup of tea.",7,0,0,4 October 2008
Casino Royale," Let Down By The Ending
","This is the first Bond film I've ever seen (to be honest, the idea of a womanising assassin in a load of action flicks aimed mainly at guys has just never appealed to me) but after hearing all the brilliant reviews about Casino Royale I thought it was about time I gave in and took the plunge into my first Bond film. I wasn't disappointed! You'd have to have been on another planet the last couple of years to have not heard all the criticism Daniel Craig has had in this part - I hadn't even seen the film yet I could recite all the faults - 'He's too ugly to play Bond', 'He's too old', 'He's just awful!' so you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find that not only did Daniel Craig not resemble a troll (as some haters would have you believe) and definitely was not too old to be believable in the role, but that his acting was also top notch. As I've said, this is the first Bond film so I can't compare Craig to the other actors who've portrayed Bond, but I felt like he did a fine job with the script he had and have no reason to complain. Likewise, I really liked Judi Dench as M, and though Mads Mikkelsen played a very good villain in Le Chiffre, but Eva Green didn't really bring anything to the character Vesper apart from perhaps looking the part.My complaints of this film have to be a) the script (the romantic lines between Vesper and Bond in the last 40 minutes or so are cringe-worthy) and b) the ending, though I've heard it's less cheesy than most bond films. I guess it's the only ending they could have to keep true to Bond and the previous films, which is a shame because it takes this film down from a 5 star rating to a 4 in my eyes. But there is plenty in this film to make up for it's few faults. I felt that all the Casino royale scenes were done brilliantly, script, acting, + direction, and, as a little side note, I also love the main song for this film, Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name'. Take a chance on this film, especially if you've never seen a Bond film before. You might be pleasantly surprised!",7,0,0,4 October 2008
Gangs of New York," Not At All What I Was Expecting
","My main reason for wanting to see this film was because, after seeing 'The Departed' some weeks back I have now become a huge fan of DiCaprio's acting and heard from fans that this was one of his best performances. I'm a self-confessed very poor historian, so I knew very little about the civil war raging through America in the time this film was set (1860s I believe) and it was only afterwards I discovered that New York had in fact been ruled by gangs during this time period, riddled with violence and bloodshed.Whenever you watch a Martin Scorsese film, you know you are going to be in for a treat, especially if that film also boasts Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis cast in the two main roles, and this film is certainly no disappointment. The film is slow, and focuses more of the build up of characters, tension and atmosphere, and although some who are used to the more action packed, fast paced movies Hollywood has spewed out in the last decade may find it too slow to keep their interest, I actually found it fascinating, and never lost interest once throughout (which, considering it's length, is quite an achievement).DiCaprio delivers well (though I still believe that his performance as Billy Costigan in 'the Departed' is the best I've ever seen him), as does Daniel Day-Lewis - both play their parts with the skill and talent that has allowed them to build such a name for themselves over the years. I was also impressed by Brendan Gleeson and his portrayal of Walter McGinn, but found the remainder of the performances mediocre - there was nothing especially bad about them, but nothing to deserve further praise either.I'm not the biggest fan of films about gangs, or mob wars, but a film doesn't have to belong in my favourite genre for me to appreciate it's quality and give it the respect and recognition it deserves. 'Gangs of New York' is not my typical favourite film, but I recognise that it is very good none the less, with a very thought-provoking ending that asks us to question where what we see around us now had once come from.",8,0,0,4 October 2008
Braveheart," Incredibly Moving
","Let's get this straight from the start - I am a very poor historian and know very little about whether the events portrayed in this novel are closer to fact or fiction, except for what I have read from other reviewers who complain about the historical inaccuracies in Braveheart. I guess that is part of why I was so open-minded when I saw this film - I didn't really mind (or should I say notice) any deviances from the reality of what happened, really all I was looking for was a good film to watch with perhaps a little history thrown in, and that's exactly what this film provides.Following the story of William Wallace who, after his (secret) wife Murron MacClannough is killed by Englishmen who are supposedly keeping 'order' in Scotland, Wallace decides to be the one to stand up and fight against the English for Scottish freedom. It's an incredibly interesting (and moving) story portrayed brilliantly (the film is close to 3 hours in length but doesn't feel it) with parts that will make you cry, make you laugh, inspire you, and infuriate you with the injustice being shown. Mel Gibson plays Wallace to perfection, in fact, the entire cast are faultless - the children at the beginning, Murron, the princes and kings, princess Isabelle - absolutely everyone, including the extras.The film was made in 1995, but doesn't show it's age at all, in fact, it could be shown as a new film in cinemas today and nobody would notice. Mel Gibson also did the directing for this film, showing that not only is he an incredibly talented actor, but a brilliant director to. He is a man of many talents!! This is an incredible film that is definitely worth a watch. If you're a historian though, just go into it with an open mind. Fantastic stuff.",6,4,7,4 October 2008
Atonement," Beautifully haunting, and hauntingly beautiful
","What is up with all these 1, and 2 star reviews!? Even if the film differs from the novel by Ian McEwan (which, I would not know as I have not read the book yet) at least take this film for what it is - a beautiful & haunting story of a love torn apart by a child's mistake, and stop making comparison's of how bad this film is compared to the book because it deserves to be judged on it's own right too. The story is gorgeous - James McAvoy and Keria Knightley play the lovers Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis, who, upon finally admitting their feelings for each other are torn apart as Robbie is sent to prison for allegedly raping the Tallis' cousin Lola Quincey. However, Robbie was not guilty, and was only thought so because Cecilia's younger sister, Briony Tallis, jumped to the wrong conclusion. The remainder of the film tells of what happens to Robbie, Cecilia, and Tallis years after this event, and ultimately, whether the lovers ever managed to be together and have the happy ending they deserved.This film is achingly sad - all about lost opportunities, what may have been contrasted to what was, and how a single mistake can rip apart a person's entire life. 3 people suffered greatly at the hands of the lie, and the film is about Briony's attempts to repair the wound she created, because, as she grew up, she realised how devastatingly wrong her actions were. The acting in this film is superb. I have always been a fan of James McAvoy and this is probably my favourite performance by him - McAvoy acts with such subtlety and intensity, in every scene you can feel his emotions, exactly what the character of Robbie is feeling, even when he doesn't say a single word. I've never been the biggest fan of Keira Knightley (actually, I believe her acting in the POTC films is quite simply, dreadful), but she blew me away as Cecilia Tallis - I don't know whether she felt more at home with this type of character, or whether her movie experiences since have improved her acting skills drastically, but she embodied the character of Cecilia perfectly, playing the party, very, very well. But, my favourite performance by far has to be from Saoirse Ronan (very unusual name) as the 13 year old Briony Tallis - it is one of those instances where you don't even realise this is an actor playing a part - she was entirely believable and more than faultless in her performance.This is a beautiful film that I believe will be remembered in many years to come. It thoroughly deserves every one of those 5 stars I have given it, and probably more. It is a subtle, intense, hauntingly beautiful film with brilliant acting, phenomenal direction, a very good script (though how much of that came straight out of the novel I do not know) and even a perfect soundtrack. Faultless. And beautiful. Watch it now.",9,5,8,4 October 2008
V for Vendetta," Well...
","There are good aspects to this film. And then there are bad. The good includes the story (set in the future where the government controls the population, removing privilege's such as freedom, food, opposition), the twists and turns in the plot, the filming (its spectacular to the eyes if nothing else), and certain characters and actors playing those roles (Stephen Fry, for example). However, the first 30 minutes of this film, though full of action, failed to grip me (maybe there should have been an explanation at the start about what was going on exactly), Natalie Portman's acting failed to convince me (and I'm a fan of hers usually!), the love story between the two main characters was bizarre, and sometimes it becomes rather difficult to work out exactly what is going on. It's a good film, but had the potential to be so much better. Hope they may do a re-make in 20 years or so that would be worthy of a 5 star rating.",5,2,5,4 October 2008
