Casablanca," A Classic
",One of my favorite movies of all time. 'Waters? What Waters? We're in the desert.' I think this has to be one of the most quotable movies of all time. Think about all the great lines! 'We'll always have Paris.' 'Here's looking at you kid.' 'Play it again Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By. 'Every line is better than the last. One of the most surprising things about Casablanca is that it is truly timeless. I still smile when I hear Rick tell the band to 'Play La Marseillaise. Play it!' I often wonder if this movie would be popular today? There's no great car chases or big stunts- it's just a great story that is beautifully acted.,10,3,4,29 October 2014
