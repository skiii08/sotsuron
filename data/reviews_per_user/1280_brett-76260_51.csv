Ford v Ferrari," Just pure power
","First off I really cant stand Christian Bale or his acting. Ive never been a fan on anything hes done. I will be honest, he did an outstanding job and was clearly the right person to play this character. Even Matt Damon killed it and they both played off each other perfect. I really cant find any flaws in the story, the acting, the directing or anything that goes along in movies. It was almost a perfect movie for me and easily makes my top ten movies of all time. Just perfect from start to finish. Man what a great time and a great, great movie. Just awesome!!!",10,2,3,22 February 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Crap this was a waste
","Good lawd what a waste of time on this one... long, boring and just a mess to watch. They could have cut out half the movie by editing out all the items that did nothing for the plot. Can't believe this has so many good reviews as it was hard to watch after about the first 15 minutes. Could have been so much better... epic failure!!!",2,2,7,6 July 2018
Angels & Demons," Solid follow up
",The second installment is probably better than the davinici code. It flowed a little cleaner than the first and just a little better story. Worth watching your into the series,8,0,0,4 December 2018
First Man," Epic failure...
",Holy crap this was not good. I so wanted to like it but it failed on so many levels I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with the bad.Ryan will probably win some award for his performance but it was aweful. Like watching paint dry during the winter. Takes forever and ever. He should get a razzie award for that performance cause it was slower than sling blade eating taters. Next The sound in the movie was nothing short ridiculous. One second you were plugging your ears then the next you were like 'what did he just say? I couldn't hear him' Their lips were moving but you couldn't understand any of it. the sound guy should never work in film again. Also they must have slapped things together last minute cause the editing was shotty. They left some takes in the movie that you have no idea what your looking at. Just random takes of darkness or nothing... if you sit through this stinker you'll figure out what I mean. And here is the worst... the entire movie was non stop shaking of the camera. It was mind numbing... They couldn't even have a simple one on one conversation without the camera shaking like some guy with Parkinson's. It was that bad. Worst shaking of the camera movie I ever had to sit through. So many bad things I just wanted it to end. You would think they would spend a lot of time on the moon landing itself right??? WRONG!!! They spend about 10-15 minutes on the moon landing and the other 2 hours shaking the damn camera. Good parts you ask? Didn't it have some good qualities? It must have some good parts cause la la land stars in it. Yes I guess it did have one good quality. It ended...,2,13,22,21 October 2018
Black Swan," Just a hot mess
",Yah this was not good. Acting was good but the movie and directing was pretty painful to watch. Why directors feel the need to shake the damn camera in every scene is ridiculous. If you love movies that shake the camera for two hours this one is for you. I almost turned it off in the first 10 minutes cause the shaking of the camera... pathetic... I just don't get all the high reviews cause this just didn't work for me. A hot mess from start to finish. If you give this movie anything higher than a 3 you need to get out more and expand your movie portfolio a tick.,2,1,8,12 February 2020
The Finest Hours," Decent but full of flaws
","Okay the movie was just not good... Crikey did they embellish the story big time. Few things to ponder on... Was he driving a boat or a submarine?? I didnt know regular boats could shoot under the water like a torpedo for as long as they did. Oh and cant forget when they went submarining they didnt lose one crew member in the process. An open air boat going full on submarine and not ONE crew member floated away??? Hmmmm ok. Then how bout those epic waves they had to surf going over the Bar... Wait I meant to say Bah... They are from Boston so its not bar, but bah... Who would tackle those waves one in a small little dingy? C'mon man give us viewers a little credit for not being stupid or totally gullible Then the big ship sinks exactly where it beached itself??? Yup it sunk basically in the same place as it was beached. Okay then how about the water during this massive snow storm... With all the submarining they did you would think one would have a little hypothermia.. You know kind of like jack Dawson?? Nope not a one even looked cold during the entire movie. Like I said they embellished everything they could to make it more dramatic. It was almost unwatchable at times it was so hokey... Sorry kapt kirk but this movie was more of a comedy than a real life drama. Gonna have to give a hard no to this one chachi...mext",3,0,0,10 March 2020
The Sound of Music," Just a classic that will never get old
","Song and dance is definitely not my thing. However I've seen this movie dozens and dozens of times overs the years. It never gets old... if you have never seen it it's well worth your time. They just don't make them like this anymore. Rent it or buy it, a true classic that is perfect from start to finish...",10,22,22,28 April 2018
Catch Me If You Can," Solid solid solid
","Leonardo always delivers no matter what role he plays. I think he is one of the most talented actors around. Dont like his politics but man can he act. If you haven't seen this movie before it is well worth your time. If you like movies based on true stories, this will certainly entertain you. Grab an adult beverage and some skittles cause this is a good one!!!",9,2,3,18 January 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best of the series
",No question this is the best movie of the entire series. A classic that will never get old or outdated. I saw this movie when it first came out And its just as enjoyable today as it was 40 years ago... Crikey im getting old... A great at choice to watch considering the crap Hollywood is putting out these days.,9,0,0,18 January 2020
Unbreakable," The correct title should be 'Unwatchable'
","Who in the crap is giving this turd high ratings? OMG what a complete waste of my time. The only people giving this a high rating are probably people that worked on the movie. Yes its that bad folks.
M Night S. hasn't made a good movie since the sixth sense or maybe the village. Don't bother with this one chachi cause its A waste of time... did You see 'lady in the water'? This is worse than that for crying out loud.",2,1,8,2 March 2020
The Impossible," Great flick
",Much better than I expected it to be and I have to say the acting was first class. Man Ewan can put on a performance and thought he was outstanding. Even the kids pulled off some great and believable roles. Sad day in history but seeing this kind of story is quite moving and humbling. Well with a few hours of your time,9,0,1,3 February 2019
The Notebook," Don't get all the hype
","Well I'm not really sure why this movie get such high ratings. It's decent but certainly not as good as I was expecting. There are better chick flicks out there that's for sure. If you want to impress your date try watching Nottinghill. Thats a great chick flick. This one is boring, predictable and way too slow... Next!",3,3,6,13 February 2020

Hotel Rwanda," Solid
","Even though the movie is filled with holes, it is solid with great acting. I think the editing killed the flow of the entire movie. Had the editing been better, my review would probably be a nine. Even with that is is Worth a few hours of your time.",7,0,0,23 December 2019
"I, Tonya"," Solid flick
","Superb acting all the way around. Movie lived up to the hype in my opinion and well worth watching. It's funny, it's crazy, it's unreal at times and when it's all said and done, it's sad... tonya was not dealt the best hand in life when it came to her family and I really have a new opinion of her... her family was so jacked up I'm amazed she is even still sane... if you think you know her story, ya really don't until you see this movie. If you're debating on watching this, hit the play button cause it's solid from start to finish. Really a great movie. Tonya if you ever read these reviews you are one strong person to make it out of that crap you dealt with growing up. You win the gold medal in life that's for sure...",9,3,5,17 November 2018
Shutter Island," You gotta be kidding...
","You gotta be kidding on all the high reviews. I watched this utter stupidity based on All the high ratings. I cant begin to explain what a complete hot mess of a movie this was. How it received so many good reviews is completely beyond me. Ug what a disaster and a complete waste of time. Hey if you want to watch a movie that is complete nonsense, have at it cha chi cause its another Scorsese turd.",1,4,14,3 January 2020
Notting Hill," Great movie
","Im usually not a chick flick kinda guy but this is definitely the exception. It is funny throughout and just a good story. Julia Roberts actually does a Solid job and Hugh grant is perfect in this role. Music is good and again, its just Funny. Listen guys if your girl wants to watch a romantic comedy, you cant go wrong with this one. You will like it as much as she does. And if you don't like it, well lighten up a bit and quit taking things so serious. Even though its a 20 year old movie, it still holds up in 2020. Probably my favorite romcom of all time...",9,0,0,11 March 2020

The Revenant," Do not get it
","So I've seen the movie twice now and just dont get the high ratings. Yes the movie has great visuals but c'mon, Leo maybe spoke 20 lines in the entire movie. Mostly it was him grunting and moaning. Story was also slower than sling blade eating taters so I guess I really missed something. If you want to watch that kind of movie, this is for you! Moaning and groaning will be about the only thing you'll remember. Tom hardy played a better character than Leo...",3,2,3,14 March 2020
Warrior," Awesome flick
",Short and sweet review. Great acting and really a solid story. Much more than your typical fighting movie. Well worth a few hours of your time!!! Watch it!!! Go watch it right now!,9,3,5,1 April 2018
Heartbreak Ridge," Outstanding
","Being a United States Marine myself, I can say I really loved this movie. No its not spot on when it comes to Marine Uniforms or regulations. Yes it might be a little unrealistic about day to day operations and how things are done in the real Corps. Lot of Real Marines do not like this movie for one reason or another... I say they take things a little to serious. This movie was not meant to be a documentary... Its not meant to portray the real Marine Corps... Its just a movie that was made to entertain. I spent years in the Corps and this movie motivated me to join up. I love it and have probably watched it no less than 300 timesðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Gunny Highway never fails to deliver some outstanding one liners. If you haven't seen this before hit the play button and down a few cold ones. It is an awesome movie.

Yesterday," Really really good
","I have to say im really not even a Beatles fan. I like some of the songs but as a whole, I can take them or leave em. So I didnt expect too much from this movie. Man was i wrong. It far exceeded any expectations I had. It was a great story, well directed and the actors were spot on. It was fun and I even found myself singing along... I guess you could even say I have a new fondness for the music. Was it the best movie ever? No... But it was certainly worth a few hours of my time. I will definitely watch it again... Fun fun movie...",9,4,7,15 March 2020

12 Strong," Cheese factor...
",Man this could have been so much better... long movie filled with cheese and guacamole. Considering the fact I'm a US Marine I dig war flicks... but this was so unrealistic I dont even know where to start. Expert shooting while riding horses in a full on sprint??? Nobody is that good cmon... movie is filled with that kind of stuff. watch if you must but not at all what it should have been. They should have made this movie along the same lines as Lone Survivor. You know realistic??? I mean this movie was based on actually events. What evs it is what it is... A big turd,3,2,8,24 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Ug
","This is by far the worst of the bunch. The voice overs, the terrible make up on the emperor, the bad acting, the ridiculous graphics, the cheesy stupid looks Aniken gives you once he turns to the dark side, did I mention the terrible make up on the emperor and his beyond horrible accent? If you really watch this movie and listen to the acting, its comical... Painful Even. Watch it again and study the acting job by all of them. It is so bad I cant believe people gave this turd anything higher than a 2. The acting and voice overs are bush league and a complete embarrassment to the franchise. Go back and watch it again... And really watch and listen To the actors. Director is to blame on this one... Horrible from start to finish...",1,0,10,17 May 2020

Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock the horrible...
",Wow this movie sucked from the opening scene. Matter of fact I tuned it off one 50 minutes into it. I just couldn't continue with the torture. This is not what you would expect in a Sherlock Holmes movie that's for sure. A real stinker... I'd rather sit on the crapper for an hour than have to watch that again...

Creed II," Solid
","Loved seeing Ivan but wished the wife would have had a much larger role. She still looks pretty
Dag gone good! Probably was a tad awkward since she is stallones ex wife but they pulled it off and think they made it work with what they gave her. Good to see professionalism come out of this real life situation. Anyway Movie holds much more than just boxing. Solid story line and good acting. Have to say this might be my favorite behind rocky iv. If you are wanting a retro 80's style rocky flick this ain't it. The story has moved on to this generation. It's okay to let go and move on as well. I've been around since day one of the rocky movies and once you come to grips with that and treat this like a new franchise, it's very easy to like it... maybe clubber Lang jr. next??? Be kind of fun... don't be afraid to like it!!!",7,0,2,11 December 2018

","Song and dance is definitely not my thing... I have to say this flick is the exception. Really good movie and I've seen in now multiple times. My kids love it and watch it all the time.

Midway," Full of flaws...
","I wanted to like this movie... I wanted to love this movie. But like so many others, it failed to deliver. Whoever did the editing on this flick did a terrible job. One minute they are in pearl harbor. The next minute they are fighting a battle halfway across the ocean and then the very next minute they are back at home. That happened a few times in this movie. Then the acting... Ug. I was happy when Dennis quaid left the movie cause his deep froggy voice was so freakin distracting I couldn't even concentrate on the movie. For crying out loud cough and clear your throat out man!!! Just awful to listen too. Then we come to the battle itself. Which lasted a whopping 20 minutes. They should have focused on the namesake of the movie for Pete's sake. Just a disappointment. The graphics were great but the story, the editing and quaids pathetic voice over was a huge letdown. Watch for the graphics... Everything else is mediocre at best...",3,1,6,16 February 2020
