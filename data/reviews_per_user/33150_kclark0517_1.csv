Ghost," insurance papers
","I often wonder about what the lives of the characters are like after the movie is over. Like, how are Bobby and Snooky doing? Did Oda Mea ever hear (or is ever haunted) by Prospect Place Willie after his death? Or Carl for that matter? Did they try to scare her and her sisters? What about Ortisha and Orlando? Did Orlando ever come back to Oda Mae, jump into her body, and tell Ortisha where the insurance papers were? Did she keep the same 'Autumn Sunrise' hair color? Does Molly keep the penny that Sam slid her underneath the door as a good luck charm forever? My friends think I'm silly for quoting Ghost lines all the time. They think I'm way too into this movie! I just tell them '(insert name) you're in danger girl!'I pushed a penny under the door for my husband and he didn't know what I was doing. I said 'It's for luck' and he replies 'What's wrong with you?!!' I tell 'It's for luck. The love inside....take it with you.' He's confused, I think he thinks I'm talking to white people on the phone during Arsenio. I say 'It's Sam Wheat!!' He left me long too long ago. He had a transfusion to make on the second floor and he stole my pen. He wanted to keep it. He made up for it by buying some Asian Pears. I told him 'Don't you see!.. I'm not a fake!....not about this....' Whenever someone calls on the phone, and we don't know who it is, I say it must be Rita Miller. That's our running joke. I get gas from time to time.",10,5,9,20 April 2006
