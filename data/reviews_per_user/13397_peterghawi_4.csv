Ford v Ferrari," Wow.
","Laugh, cry, get the feels, this movie has it all. Christian bale shines as always and Matt damon loves chewing gum. I wonder what kind of gum he was chewing for 78% of the movie. Anyway it was great I just thought that was funny. If you love cars it's a plus. I almost skeeted my pants like 4 times during this movie.",9,16,29,20 November 2019
