Blade Runner 2049," Boring and slow!
","I really wanted to see the film having seen the original, but this film is literally a waste of 2 hours! Nothing happens from start to finish!A couple of good fight scenes and some eerie 'music' is about it!I strongly recommend not watching it!",3,6,10,15 February 2019
