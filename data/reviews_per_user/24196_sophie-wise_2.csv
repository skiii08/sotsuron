Iron Man 3," Excellent send off for Iron Man
","It's Christmas time for Tony Stark and Pepper Potts, who after the events in New York (also known as The Avengers) want nothing more than to return to a life of philanthropy and ease. Unfortunately it's not as easy as all that as Stark is plagued with post-vortex panic attacks and insomnia, with which the only way to cope is to tinker and spend evening upon evening in his workshop creating various suit prototypes. Then, as if that wasn't troubling enough, some terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin is high jacking television, making threats and blowing up various locations and/or people. In a way this third installment of the Iron Man franchise is the darkest. For the first time we see Stark in a truly vulnerable state. He loses his friend Happy to a coma and after a public, mediated threat to The Mandarin, manages to lose his mansion, flashy cars and for the majority of the film, his suits. That and a bout of post-traumatic stress and we, my friends, have a dilapidated superhero.The villainous protagonists are also detrimentally ruthless, from the stereotypically ethnic Mandarin (played wonderfully by Ben Kingsley in a role full of surprises) shooting someone in the head on live television, to Aldrich Killian (a previously snubbed-by-Stark scientific engineer) playing with temperatures of over 3000 degrees – the threat feels inconceivably surmountable. Thank goodness then for the likes of Shane Black who contrasts this sense of inevitable doom with subtle gags (kudos for the inclusion of Downton Abbey and a reference to Croydon) and sharp, sassy dialogue as- ever brilliantly performed by Robert Downey Jr. Laughs both big and small, in addition to an unlikely sidekick in the form of a cool young kid named Harley, gives Iron Man 3 its heart and ultimately carries the film. It would not be a Marvel blockbuster however, without a good dose of explosive action which Iron Man 3 absolutely delivers and kudos to the special effects team who work wonders with certain suit trickery. Equally the T-1000-esque super-hot humans were visually effective, constantly regenerating and glowing as a result of Killian's Extremis and Advanced Idea Mechanics. However the action also led to the films' downfall. Sequences such as the skydiving 'barrel of monkeys' felt a bit over the top and the last thirty minutes or so did drag on a little too long. Nevertheless, these are minor qualms outshone by Black's main strength – fast-paced, entertaining dialogue with a mixture of zing, heart and soul, excellently implemented into what is essentially a fun yet smart, action-filled romp. All of which made stronger, by wonderful performances from Kingsley, Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce who so obviously revels in playing the bad guy. As Marvel's first outing since The Avengers, the pressure was on and it is a true testament to the strength of Iron Man 3 that The Hulk and co were not missed (although stick around after the credits just in case you still have a hankering). However as the believed last installment of the Iron Man franchise, blockbusters boasting this strong a calibre will be - and boy, what a send off.",7,1,2,14 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," The Cabin in the Woods: Homage to Horror
","I have a confession – last night was the first time I saw Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods. Believe me, I hang my head in shame whilst writing this admittance. Now, however, I can sit bolt upright with a big grin on my face after experiencing such a brilliant film. I enjoyed it so much in fact, that I feel compelled to write this somewhat love letter to a film that is well... a love letter in itself, a declaration of adoration for the horror genre.For those of you who have not seen it (I won't lambast you as I don't really have a leg to stand on here) the film follows the basic premise of five teens taking a vacation to a cabin... in the woods (funnily enough). Whilst there they manage to unearth some deadly goings on and all hell ensues, as each teen is ultimately killed off one by one. Pretty formulaic no? Well herein lies the brilliance in the film – Goddard and Whedon not only recognise this traditional horror formula but wave it in our faces and play with it for the entirety of the film . From the beginning we are introduced to Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley (wonderfully played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford), who are technicians or 'gamemasters' manning a soulless control room. They (to a certain extent) control the fate of said teens, moulding them into stereotypes (slut, jock, joker, nerd and virgin) and induce pheromones that ultimately make them hornier and stupider (heaven forbid they actually stick together in a crisis). Basically every horror cliché is knowingly implemented in order to cause the inevitable demise of our beloved teenage protagonists (or so we are led to think). Now, I know what you're thinking and yes – Wes Craven did do this with Scream in 1996. However, his postmodern take was primarily on the slasher sub- genre. Goddard and Whedon cover it all.The death of each teen is caused by the zombified Buckner family, an undead crew the teens unknowingly raised themselves. Whilst I love a bit of zombie action as much as the next person, it albeit felt anti- climactic. That is until two surviving teens manage to break into the control facility and let loose every horror creation you could ever think of via a 'system purge'. An all matter of carnage ensues creating the most entertaining sequence of the film. Fair enough, the ending of the film may spoil the whole experience for some but for me it didn't – I was still reeling with enjoyment over a Merman eating Hadley. In fact, I will still reeling with enjoyment over the preceeding 80 minutes or so. As a film I believe it was totally miss-marketed and therefore underrated. It's not your typical horror film as most punters believed, nor is it a 'game-changer'. It's an intellectual, postmodern homage intertwining every horror cliché and monster into the narrative. That, and it's all spectacularly delivered via brilliant script and enjoyable performances (particularly by Jenkins and Whitford). There is no literal breaking of the 'fourth wall' but Goddard and Whedon know we are there and are having fun with us. Well, trying to anyway. For those unfamiliar with the horror genre, the subtext and intertextual references will be totally lost on them. The influx of all things monstrous at the end will no doubt appear silly and definitely not terrifying (although that in itself is entirely subjective. For instance, if you have a fear of clowns or extremely toothy sugar plum fairies, odds are you will get a bit frightened). To horror aficionado's, however, it's a celebration, a love letter, a joyous game of who's-who in the horror genre as we revel in their destruction.The film is also wonderfully comical. The chemistry and one-liners from Hadley and Sitterson shine throughout and a scene transition within which the 'final girl' reaches her apparent demise, but in the background whilst control room workers celebrate, is the epitome of sadistic comedy. As much as it is a love letter to the horror genre, it in some ways, is also a critique. The film highlights generic issues of senseless nudity via a scene in which men eagerly await a pair of boobs ('Does it really matter if we see...?' 'Got to keep the customer satisfied...'). The five teens are also caricatures of the contemporary vacuous types that go hand in hand with the genre. Goddard and Whedon, furthermore, denounce the genres recent devolution in to torture porn territory by not including it whatsoever.Equally, there are a few criticisms toward the film itself. The use of CGI detracts from the experience and appears noticeably out of place. Also, as I have already touched upon, the ending was perhaps a step too far. The sadist in me would have preferred an even more nihilistic approach, with the film ending at Dana (our surviving 'virgin') shooting Marty (the 'joker'). Critics have expressed a disliking toward the films self-referential nature and lack of scares. However, I disagree. I may be biased as a horror fanatic, but there are enough thrills and spills to entertain everyone. Furthermore a little intelligence and self- reflexivity never hurt anyone... apart from those in the film of course.I completely understand that some may hate this film, finding it pretentious, silly and not even remotely scary. But hell, in essence it's two grown fan boys writing a love letter to the hyperdiegetic world of horror, and boy... did I enjoy reading it.",8,0,3,14 May 2013
