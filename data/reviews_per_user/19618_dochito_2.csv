Hereditary," Scary beyond belief
",THE MOST SCARY movie I ever watched!! scary beyond belief....terrific actors though.... Toni Collette best actress ever!! same goes for Alex Wolff who played as her son....,10,1,3,26 August 2018
Bird Box," Pretty Bad!
","So many flaws, so unbelievable, worst science fiction movie I'd seen last time.
The ending has no sense at all! so the blind village live in peace, and those between them that are not blind are unable to see the bad monster neither....the boat was upside down in the river, food is gone, all is gone, but the parrots in the box are okay? really?
The only good thing in the movie was Sandra Bullock.",2,6,10,13 January 2019
