The Blair Witch Project," A difficult film to forget.
","One of the most striking things that I noticed after seeing the film is that even several days later, I was still thinking about several of the scenes. I can't remember the last time that I saw a film that had the same lasting emotional impact. I don't know how well the film stands up to multiple viewings, but I think that I will have to go back to see it again because I can't quite stop thinking about it.I am a veteran viewer of many horror and suspense movies and this is the only movie that I have seen since I was a child that actually frightened me.I would recommend this film for anyone seeking an intense visceral, emotional, and visual experience.",9,1,2,11 August 1999
