The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," perfect perfect I have extremely high expectations on Part Two
","perfect perfect perfect that's all i can say , this is really Unexpected loved this movie 10000x more than the others twilight films combined , Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson deserves an Oscar for their amazing performance , their performances were outstanding and Bill Condon saved twilight's *** you know the others ones wasn't half great as Breaking Dawn my rating for Breaking Dawn is 10/10 for the Twi-hards , 8/10 for NON fans , 4.5/10 for the twilight haters , 0/10 for the potter-fans because they will never love twilight . Bill Condon makes Breaking Dawn part 1 almost better than the book , even thought some critics say its sucks but i read some of them actually they have NO idea about the whole story except the pregnancy , they are paid to hate on twilight they just read the Wiki of Breaking Dawn and then they criticized the movie without mention anything about the great acting and the amazing directing so the critics are lame don't take them too seriously",10,14,60,16 November 2011
