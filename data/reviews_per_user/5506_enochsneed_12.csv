The Finest Hours," Thrilling story sunk by conventional script
","As someone who has lived at various places on the British coast all his life I have tremendous respect for the men of our Royal National Lifeboat Institution - all volunteers - who are willing to risk their lives to rescue others, and I love sea stories. The US Coastguard is managed by the government and has salaried officers, but on the evidence of this film they have more than their own share of guts and determination.The best scenes in this film are undoubtedly those set at sea, the crew of the Pendleton jury-rigging a helm and nursing the hulk along until she can be run aground, and the men of CG 36500 fighting their way out to sea to save them (even if CG 36500 does develop the characteristics of a submarine a couple of times. I know lifeboats are designed to be non-sinkable, but not *that* non-sinkable). These scenes are truly edge-of-the-seat thrilling.Unfortunately, in order to make a film, the story has to be 'dramatised'. So the Coast Guard station is commanded by an outsider mistrusted by locals who matter darkly over every decision he makes, and the hero is partly shunned as a Jonah after a failed rescue the previous year. (Is everyone around Cape Cod so sour and miserable? Just asking). On the Pendleton there is some Alpha-Male tussling for supremacy among the crew until they accept the 'it's so crazy it might just work' ideas of the Chief Engineer. These back stories feel very forced and detract from the true drama of the rescue itself.The film tells a good story, but not always in a good way. Worth watching once, but not a film to keep coming back to.",7,0,0,16 January 2020
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Watch the TV series instead
","I really wanted to enjoy this film. I watch the 1979 TV series at least once a year and was looking forward to a new, dark, edgy take on a well-loved story.I was very disappointed. First, the plot is mashed up (for example Ricki Tarr, who should set Smiley's mole hunt in motion, does not appear until the half-way point). Secondly, characters are not developed and even altered (Percy Alleline is a peevish bully, rather than an over-promoted pompous buffoon who has been suckered into giving the KGB a pipeline into Western intelligence, and Peter Guillam is fashionably gay). We don't even get any sense of Bill Haydon's motivation to turn double agent apart from a throwaway line about the West being 'rather horrible'. Colin Firth does make more of Haydon's frustration at working for an increasingly impotent power - Britain - when he wants to make a mark on History and therefore turns to a more dynamic force which he believes the USSR to be.There is no suspense in the key scenes where Peter Guillam steals a top secret file from the archives, or even in the revelation of the mole. What Hitchcock could have done with these sequences! One scene which did work for me on a symbolic level was the Christmas party. This is original to the film but does suggest how the British intelligence service (and, by implication, Britain itself) has become lazy and hedonistic, and is losing its grip.Gary Oldman totally fails to capture George Smiley's self-deprecating intelligence. We get no indication of Smiley piecing together a jigsaw and realising what the 'Witchcraft' project really means. Film-makers often confuse British reserve with unemotional stolidity, and Oldman walks straight into that trap.The cinematography looks good, with shadowy interiors suggesting the claustrophobia of the world of espionage, but the design for the Circus HQ is all wrong - it is not a huge open-plan office, but a series of small, seedy little rooms.All in all this was a huge disappointment. I came straight home from the cinema and put the BBC series back into my DVD player.",1,76,122,31 December 2011
Tangled," Great fun!
","My wife and I found ourselves watching this together on Christmas Eve in Portugal. Our Portuguese isn't brilliant but we could follow the story ('Rapunzel' meets 'Snow White') and a film we just happened to find on TV kept us enthralled for an hour and a half! 'Tangled' has strong characters, humour (and it really is laugh-out-loud funny), thrills, a few tears and a happy ending. It is the sort of family-focused animated film Disney used to make. I prefer the old-style hand drawn Technicolor animation but I suppose we have to move with the times. It kept two cynical old hacks in their 50's thoroughly entertained. I would think seeing it with a family would be a great experience. Well done, Disney!",Null,2,5,25 December 2012
The Aviator," A misfire with good flying scenes
","This seems a very odd choice of film for Martin Scorsese. The director I associate with films such as 'Bringing Out the Dead' has come out with a glossy, superficial biopic which makes a hero out of a rather distasteful (racist, politically *extremely* right-wing, tax-dodging) American millionaire.There is an element of Greek tragedy about Hughes. By the standards of our culture he was a man who had everything - wealth, power, a string of glamorous lovers - but whose character contained a fatal flaw which destroyed his entire personality. Unfortunately, despite the views of others on this site, I don't feel Leonardo Di Caprio's performance is a success, although he tries hard. He still seems too callow and youthful to play a tormented 40 year-old on the brink of insanity. (When the film was released Di Caprio said there would be nothing 'dramatic' about Hughes as a recluse living in hotel rooms. I beg to differ - the story of a madman living in isolation trying to buy the government of the United States could be fascinating.)Even as the story of Hughes's early life the film is incomplete - his record-breaking coast-to-coast flight (which he completed without compass or radio) is missing - and sometimes inaccurate (his chief inquisitor in the Senate was Senator Homer Ferguson not Brewster himself).The supporting cast are equally unable to capture the glamour of the real-life figures they portray. Cate Blanchett has a decent stab at Katharine Hepburn, but Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner is a colourless washout.The film is saved by exhilarating flying scenes using very good quality CGI (having stood on the prow of a CGI 'Titanic', Di Caprio gets to stand in the nose of a CGI Gotha bomber). The XF-11 crash is horrifically realistic, and the flight of the Hercules a demonstration of sheer guts and will-power in getting the thing into the air.Ultimately, though, the film lacks drama (in terms of character development and a true story arc). It is interesting and sometimes exciting to watch but doesn't go any further with the Howard Hughes story than the Tommy Lee Jones TV mini-series from the 1970's (and that was much better acted).",5,1,4,4 May 2008
Yesterday," Entertaining if you don't think too hard
","The difficulty with imagining a world which never had The Beatles is - there was more to them than just the music. They were a cultural phenomenon as much as a musical one; 'All You Need Is Love' crystallised the attitudes of an era, it wasn't just a song. A world without that would not simply be the same world as today without the song.Well, this is a movie, it aims to entertain and it certainly does that. The songs are well presented, although again showing it was the chemistry of the four that really made them work - Jack and his backing band really can't do 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' like John, Paul, George and Ringo. On a personal note, the film has made family history because my wife: a) wanted to go to the cinema to see it, and; b) she actually enjoyed the experience. That makes about 5 cinema trips together in 32 years of marriage - how we ever got together I will never know (but I'm glad we did).",7,1,2,10 July 2019
Quantum of Solace," Unique addition to the Bond series
","I was prepared to hate QoS just thanks to word of mouth: it was the worst/shortest/hardest to follow Bond film with incomprehensible action scenes.I skipped watching it for seven years after it was released. Having finally seen it, I think it's a unique Bond film and probably an experiment that will never be repeated - certainly 'Skyfall' drew back into more familiar Bond territory with a creepy villain planning global destabilisation coupled with a bit of personal revenge.First, QoS is a direct sequel to its predecessor. In fact, it's the film 'Diamonds are Forever' would/could have been if George Lazenby hadn't torn up his letter of intent, returned his advance fee and given up the role of Bond. 'Diamonds are Forever' would have opened with Bond's wedding and his wife's murder. A very dark, violent tale of personal revenge would have followed. Instead we got a safe mix of humour and a few - very few - thrills. Maybe Lazenby's Bond would have almost ruined his MI6 career and been hounded by his own people and the CIA as he went after Blofeld, who was now being courted by governments for his technological know-how? No, this would have been far too cynical for 1971.Second, the film actually carries a political message. The villains here don't want to rule the world, they want to control the water supply of an entire continent. Some think this is lame, but it amounts to the same thing. The scenes of villagers desperately trying to catch the last drops of water falling from their old well are actually very moving. The water source finally stops and they leave sadly on the next bus, to who knows what future.The Quantum organisation doesn't have its own space station, but it can buy individuals, and strong-arm governments into giving them control over natural resources, their sale and distribution. Can't you just hear news headlines trumpeting the 'vigorous programme of economic reform' of Bolivia's new government?. Just to rub the message in, there's a clear reference to Venezuela's President Chavez, the 'Marxist giving oil money back to the people'. The Bond films have never made such an open reference to the contemporary world, or taken such a clear political stand. Only the fact that Quantum seems to be made up of 'rogue' elements rather than actual businessmen makes it fictional.Finally, the film is genuinely thrilling. You feel Bond really is up against the world, and the world is a very nasty place. Not merely dangerous - nasty. Gemma Arterton's tripping of Greene's henchman seems a typical piece of Bondian humour - until she is found smothered in crude oil ('Her lungs were full of it' says M, although I'm not sure when the autopsy took place!). Much less fun than 'Goldfinger'. And it's worth remembering the Quantum organisation still exists at the end of the film, however shadowy it may be.Yes, the action scenes are *very* quick and it can be hard to know who's doing what to whom, and while I admired the cutting between the chase and the Siena Palio, for example, I found the same technique confusing in the opera sequence. I loved the film, and I'm looking forward to a Bond double event, watching 'Casino Royale' and QoS back-to-back.As I said, this comes across as a unique experiment in the Bond canon, and one which will probably never be repeated, but it was worth the effort and I loved it.",8,0,7,24 January 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Spielberg shows contempt for his audience
","That's the only assumption I can make from this terrible sequel to an exciting original (albeit one that was dumbed down from its source novel).I wish I could have listened in to the story conferences for this piece of schlock: 'I've got it! There's another island nobody knows about because all the architects and engineers and scientists and the accountants who kept InGen's books have been sworn to secrecy' 'Yeah! But this time they want to keep it safe' 'Yeah! But then there are these bad guys who still want to exploit the dinosaurs' 'Yeah! But then it all goes wrong and they get eaten' 'Yeah! But then they get one and bring it home' etc...Spielberg badly overplays his tried-and-true nerve janglers here. In 'Jaws' we had the dismembered head in the boat, in 'Jurassic Park' it was the detached arm, here we have a hand clutching a ship's wheel (what ate the crew by the way, and what happened to it? Surely the T-Rex didn't just have a quick snack and head back to the hold?). We see water discoloured by blood more than once. I felt Spielberg was saying 'You know what? I made 'Schindler's List', but you guys just want more of this stuff. OK, to hell with you, here it is and good luck!' By the time the T-Rex was charging through San Diego I felt I was back in the days of 'Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'. Away from the primeval atmosphere of the tropics the film lost any suspense it might have had.To give credit where I feel it is due, Arliss Howard's accent had me laughing out loud whenever he spoke: is it just me or did he sound very like a certain heir to the throne of England?",1,15,44,20 October 2009
2012," Roland Emmerich 'jumps the shark'
","I have enjoyed Roland Emmerich's earlier films, so I felt this was worth looking at. I only wanted entertainment, not high art. I did not expect to be so disappointed.'Independence Day' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' at least had a premise (alien invasion, climate change) which, however absurd, put the story on a firm footing. All we had here was some mumbo-jumbo about the Earth suffering a catastrophic change every so often. The ancient Maya had apparently cottoned on to this and worked out 2012 was to be the next scheduled terrestrial hiccup, but this was just thrown away in the general noise.Despite the routine spectacle and thrills with collapsing cities, last minute escapes by the central characters (to say nothing of the dog) and the usual roller-coaster ride Emmerich gives his audience, '2012' is an oddly slow and sluggish film compared to his earlier work.Another major difference is that in the earlier films the characters overcame challenges using existing technology and their own intelligence and determination. Here we are asked to believe that a fleet of high-technology arks have been built in the heart of China, in less than three years. I am not an engineer but even I know the feasibility and design study for a new passenger jet takes longer than this - it took 17 years for the Airbus A380 to get into the air from its original inception.In a strange way '2012' is both too much and not enough - too much CGI, too much of a credulity gap; not enough character, not enough real story. With more balance between these factors, it could have been a much better film.",2,0,1,21 March 2011
Lincoln," Well-made but strangely unmemorable
","I had been looking forward to seeing 'Lincoln' for many months but found myself feeling let down after actually watching it. It is beautifully set and photographed and the acting is excellent (although I found Daniel Day-Lewis's performance less compelling than David Strathairn's cynically pragmatic Seward).And yet... the film left me empty. This was signalled in the opening scene where a black soldier questions Lincoln very closely and even aggressively about his policies towards black people. Lincoln refuses to be drawn into any debate, he keeps his own counsel rather than make any declaration of principles. We have to remember Lincoln was a politician, and a very clever one. Everything he did was timed for maximum effect. The Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 turned the war from maintenance of the Union to a moral crusade which undercut the 'Peace Democrats' in Congress. The 13th Amendment was a similar proposition.The film treats slavery is treated as an abstract legal and political issue. I think 'Django Unchained' says more about the reality of Southern slavery than 'Lincoln' does.Ultimately, I felt the film took a far too reverential view of Lincoln himself (no mention of his views on Native Americans, for example), and had too much of that annoying self-regard Americans have: that they always act from the highest motives and from a morally superior position. History, as we all know, shows this is not always the case.Update 29 June: Just watched the film again on DVD. Maybe my first viewing was disturbed by reading the subtitles in a Portuguese cinema. I apologise to Daniel Day-Lewis, he deserved his Oscar. However my overall impressions remain. If you are not fascinated by political procedure and finagling this is not the film for you.",8,1,2,7 February 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," I never changed my mind about a picture so completely
","I have seen this film several times now, and the first time it really had me suckered. George Bailey really did have a wonderful life, after all. His wonderful friends and family got together to do a wonderful thing for him in his time of trouble. And Clarence got his wings... pass the Kleenex, quick!Then I started to think: George Bailey never got to travel the world and fulfil his potential to be a great architect. All his dreams faded and died as he struggled to run a business and raise a family. And what thanks did he get? His father dropped dead and landed him with the family business. His brother sold him out by getting married to the boss's daughter and landing himself in Easy Street. His uncle makes him liable for a larceny rap by losing thousands of dollars. OK, friends make up the shortfall and even the bank examiner joins in the goodwill, but - back in the cold, real world, maybe in January - George would still have to explain where the money had gone. If he couldn't do that he would still be seen as an embezzler of company funds. And meanwhile that nasty, villainous Mr Potter has got a nice little Christmas present - no sign of him making nice and handing it back.And then there's Pottersville - wow! Bars, music and women. A dance with Gloria Grahame - preferably a horizontal Mambo - would be worth any red-blooded man's hard earned cash, surely? (Ms Grahame played at my local UK theatre in 1980. She was still as sexy as hell and, apparently, a lovely person to work with.) Of course, you could always listen to the snow fall and watch 'The Bells of St Mary's' instead.So, from snuffling into my sleeve at first viewing, I am now horrified at the crabbed, stifled, thwarted, frustrated, cramped 'life' it tells us we should consider 'Wonderful'.",2,23,44,13 January 2015
Thirteen Days," Lacking in drama and doesn't ring true
","This film is supposed to portray the struggle of the Kennedy administration to face down the Soviet Union and avoid nuclear war. It's a momentous subject but this telling falls flat.First, I don't buy the scenes of Kenny O'Donnell sharing the intimate discussions of the Kennedy brothers and offering stern and weighty advice. When you see the old photo's of Jack and Bobby at the White House they look a very self-sufficient little unit - not the type to need any kind of 'Special Adviser'. I particularly feel Bobby's role in the crisis has been undervalued here.Second, there are only two real moments of drama in the whole film: Adlai Stevenson being told to 'stick it' to Ambassador Zorin at the UN and rising magnificently to the occasion, and McNamara losing his grip in the Pentagon when a warship fires flares at a Russian freighter.The final scenes of O'Donnell with his family thinking of what might have been are a rather feeble attempt to give 'meaning' or a human dimension to the crisis. Unfortunately history doesn't have meanings, it is just a series of events.A better account of the story was given in the Martin Sheen mini-series 'Kennedy', generating far greater tension. Martin Sheen also made a much more energetic and charismatic JFK. Bruce Greenwood is just bland and colourless.",5,0,3,22 March 2009
Spectre," Disappointing follow-up to 'Skyfall'
","I was really looking forward to the new Bond entry, but I have been left with a definite feeling of let-down.First, the 'Bond-goes-rogue' plot line has now been overused. Let's have him back on the side of Her Majesty's Secret Service, please.The references back to the early years of the series (Thunderball, OHMSS, You Only Live Twice, Goldfinger) are becoming too self-satisfied and a too-easy way of avoiding coming up with anything original. Maybe this is a sign of my age, because I saw the original releases.I am not sure where Bond can go from here, having wrapped up the story arc of all previous Daniel Craig efforts, but thinking caps need to be put on. Craig, incidentally, is physically very effective but has all the smooth charm of a brick.The film looks beautiful, and it's a real roller-coaster ride of action and thrills. You just come away feeling you've seen it all before somewhere.",5,4,11,8 November 2015
