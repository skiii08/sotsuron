3:10 to Yuma," What I gots to say
","In all actuality 3:10 to Yuma wasn't the best of films. It gave me a feeling of waiting in line at a bank or the dmv. Your just sitting or standing there just to wait for what you already know is going to happen. It was well made in the sense that it made you feel like you were in a bank in the wild west but still in a bank. You hear my dislikes about the film but I still gave it an eight, and it was for one reason, the ending. The ending was the best I thought because it was a mixed emotion of love and evil. Overall I gave it an 8 because the acting carried it through and the ending set it off, the all of the story in the middle could have been more thought out.\ -Bobby B.",8,0,0,1 November 2009
