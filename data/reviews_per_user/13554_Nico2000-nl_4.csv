Hereditary," No idea what all the hubbub is about...
","I have absolutely no idea what all the hubbub is about. This movie is neither scary, nor very interesting. And the twist at the end is just silly. I have seen no horror, terror, sorrow or what ever and definitely didn't need to call any helpline for emotional support. The only scary thing about the whole thing is the BS the promotion machine was able to create to sell this very mediocre movie.",1,122,248,16 June 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Stop now
","Stop making Spiderman movies. I never understood why this new movie needed to be made, so shortly after the last three with Tobey Maguire. I mean, the concept has been milked to the max, nothing could be added and indeed, this movie doesn't add anything. The story is pretty lame, the characters aren't surprising, different, or in any other way interesting and the new bad guy is just plain boring, if not at least completely superficial. Lizardman misses his arm, co th entire city needs to be transformed into lizards??? Please, that's just dumb...Sure, the special effects are nice and advanced, but that is absolutely not enough to carry this movie to any noticeable heights.I would not give this sad attempt more than a three and why the F.. it gets a sequel? I dunno...",3,2,4,15 April 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," Crap...!!!
","There's only one word for this movie... CRAP...!!!!Not because the action scenes aren't great. Not because the special effect aren't great. Not because we see our beloved Mutants, (good, or bad) display some neat new tricks. Not because of the excellent new mutants introduced, (superficial as it may be). No, because the makers of this movie displayed the shear audacity to kill off 50% percent of the main characters. How dare they...!!! Characters that have enchanted us for decades in the marvel comics and even some more, or less successful movies before this Hollywood gutter product. How dare they...!!!Because they couldn't be bothered to develop the character of Phoenix. Because of the pathetic duel between Iceman and Pyro. Because of the poor and totally inadequate ending. And what's with this 5 seconds at the end where we hear the voice of Charles...???CRAP... !!! (excuse my spelling, not my native language).",2,6,7,17 November 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," nothing, if not redundant
","I wondered after seeing the first in the 'Amazing Spiderman series' why we had to have yet another Spiderman movie after the three with Toby 'what's his name' and now I'm wondering why I actually still took the time to sit down and watch this 120 minutes of redundant dribble.It has nothing, no characters of any interest, no story of any interest, no villains of any interest and certainly no reason for ever being made, other than, probably, the greed of the producers...Completely beyond me why this movie gets a good rating here. Probably because most people who didn't cared for it didn't take the time to rate it...",1,3,30,1 June 2014
