Requiem for a Dream," What an amazing movie!
","I remember being told about the movie, and thinking that it would be wonderful and intense.  Seeing the movie, words can't perfectly describe what you come back with.  Amazingly written, directed, and acted, it displays the world as not as happy go lucky as it can be portrayed in other movies, but what real life can sometimes look like.  Jared Leto, Ellen Barstyn, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlen Wayans do a superb job.  The writer and director are amazing and original, ready to show their audience what having an addiction really is.  I recommend this movie highly and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",10,0,0,2 August 2001
Memento," One of the best films this year
","Granted, this year has been kind of slow when it comes to amazing, oscar winning movies, or at least in the past couple of months.  Well, now you have one.  One of the best movies i have seen in a while.  The Writer's/Director's idea to take a story, and completely reverse it...to show it from end to beginning, is phenominal and performed incredibly.  Guy Pierce did it again, though many don't know him from great movies like L.A. Confidential...they should know him now.  A fantastic job.  A brilliant idea that was hard to pull off, and they did it with flying colors.  The film art, direction, writing, and acting was great.  I found myself confused, frustrated, and anxious, just like Lenny was....you really experience this movie in his shoes.  You don't know what is going on, but can't wait for the next scene for the next clue.  I found myself loving someone one minute, and hating them the next, to guess it was one person and find it was something completely different.  If you want to see a good movie this year, see this one.  You won't regret it, I promise.",10,0,2,24 November 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Loved it, Laugh-Out-Loud funny!
","I loved this movie.  It was hilarious, i don't remember when i wasn't laughing.  It seems very common-place and at the same time, completely original.  I have found yet another movie to add to my list of why I like Renee Zellweger so much.  Brilliant in this movie!  Hugh Grant is also wonderful as well as the third in the cast Colin Firth.  The writing is masterful and the movie never gets old or boring.  A wonderful picker-upper. Will make you feel good no matter what.  I hope you enjoy it.",10,0,0,2 August 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Loved It
","Wanting to see a fun movie, I was told to go see this one...and needless to say, I liked it.  An ex-con just out of prison gets a crew together to do his first and hopefully last job out since being out of prison, consequently the casinos he plans to rob are owned by the man that is having a relationship with his ex wife.  A great fun movie, i recommend this movie highly.  Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, George Clooney, and Julia Roberts do a terrific job.  Brad Pitt can add this to his list of great movies that is growing fast.  Maybe not an oscar winner, but definitely just a fun movie that I would see again and will own as soon as it comes out.  Go and see it.",Null,0,0,2 January 2002
