The Avengers," Definitely Entertaining, But Nowhere Near as Good as IMDb is Making it Out To Be
","Its quite laughable that people are saying this is better than Dark Knight, because in reality its nowhere near as good. That's not to say the movie isn't entertaining, because it is. Its just not the epic IMDb's other reviewers would have you believe. The movie has its share of problems.The good:I thought Hulk was finally done right in movies, and Mark Ruffalo, I thought, did an excellent job as Bruce Banner. The Thanos spoiler at the end makes me extremely pumped to see the sequel. Tom Hiddleston was a very good Loki. Everyone fit their role quite well (with one exception). The action scenes were stellar in terms of CGI and choreography.The bad:1. There was really zero point to Scarlett Johansson aside from providing the male fans with some T&A. They tried to introduce this dynamic between her and Hawkeye, but it ended up going absolutely nowhere. 2.Joss Whedon in the comics tends to write very campy dialogue. As a result, this movie came off as more of a comedy than anything. I can deal with comedy and some of it in this movie was very well done (I loved Loki and Thor's conversation on the cliff, then Iron Man tackles Thor, and Loki speaks to the empty spot and says 'You were saying?' That was excellent). However, almost every damn word out of Tony Stark's mouth was a joke or one liner. He was basically comedy relief. I know that Tony Stark is like that in the comics, but he can be very serious as well. Tony was serious for about 2 minutes after Coulson died and then went right back to the jokes. I think Whedon placed way too much an emphasis on comedy. 3. As a result of this comedy, there was almost no character development. I see other reviews mentioning this incredible emotion and depth. They are deceiving you-there was none of either. No one grew or changed. Its a classic good vs evil story where good eventually triumphs, with no underlying messages or tones. That's all the movie really needed to be, but others are giving the movie traits that it doesn't have. 4. I really hated that they kept calling the Cosmic Cube the Tesserack or however its spelled. Its the Cosmic Cube-very simple, no need to change it. Why did they? I haven't a clue, but it was dumb.5. General plot problem #1: in Lord of the Rings, when the Uruk-hai killed Boromir, from then on you took the enemy seriously. They'd just killed one of the greatest warriors in Middle Earth, the greatest in Gondor, and broken the Fellowship. Hence, in the Two Towers, when an army of them marched on Helms Deep, you really wanted to see what happened because Man was defending against an army of credible foes. In the Avengers, it really takes away from the movie when the giant army Loki has been talking about and building up to finally shows up and are promptly decimated like they were gnats at a bug zapper. They were literally there to get slaughtered with ease and provide a big CGI fight scene. As a result, there was no emotional investment in the final fight because the big enemies were a joke. 6. General plot problem #2: In Thor, Thor beat Loki by himself pretty much. Now comes the Avengers and they're fighting the evil Loki again. Why exactly do we want to see this? Loki lost to Thor in the movie last year-good has triumphed over evil, the story has concluded. Now we're getting it rehashed but one side has 5 more members. When we've already seen the main villain lose to one of the heroes before, it takes a lot away from the movie. What's the point of doing it again? 7. General plot problem #3: the plot itself was very routine, yet they somehow managed to garble it with twists that went nowhere. Loki deliberately got himself caught to occupy the Avengers while Hawkeye under mind control stole some stuff Loki needed. Then they introduced the whole idea that Banner might be subconsciously under Loki's control, which amounted to nothing. Then Hawkeye has to bust Loki out of the SHIELD Helicarrier, when Loki has been shown to have the ability to teleport at will through solid matter. Then there's the whole sub plot of a free energy Stark Tower which becomes the focal point for the final battle while Loki opens up a portal to bring his army in using the free energy, yet they already established that the Cosmic Cube provides unlimited power itself, in which case this also amounts to nothing. SHIELD is found out to be planning to use the Cube to make WMDs and its a big secret that the Avengers are shocked at, yet Fury makes one mention of the Avengers Initiative plan and the WMDs are promptly forgotten. Coulson's death was really a plot device so Fury could smear some blood on his Captain America collector cards stashed in his locker and give the Avengers a kick start to go fight. Then there's the whole thing about going out for shwarma that was really pointless and contributed nothing. Hawkeye and Black Widow also went nowhere as previously mentioned.Overall, the 8.7 rating this movie has makes it EXTREMELY overrated. I suspect its people just being dazzled by CGI and seeing childhood comic heroes come to life on the big screen that makes them ignore the problems the movie has. They didn't let George Lucas get away with Star Wars Episodes 1-3, and yet this is generally the same thing. I wonder why.This movie is really a 6/10 but I'm feeling generous and gave it 7. Its fun to watch and I was entertained, but it really doesn't deserve the high rating it has.",7,3,12,13 May 2012
Thor," The God of Thunder is Simply Electrifying
","As a big comic fan, I understand that movies cannot be based exactly on events in the comics-its not very practical. Some say that this takes away from the story, and the movie is never as good as the comic itself. That being said, I really enjoyed Thor and it was a lot of fun. Being a comic reader, I like the little things the writers threw in as a little nod to the fans, like Thor inquiring about the name tag on the shirt Jane Foster gave him, and how it said Donald Blake, and she claimed it was her ex. Really liked the inclusion of the Warriors Three as well. But what impressed me the most was that everyone was really good in their roles! Chris Hemsworth was quite good as the cocky, yet brash God of Thunder. Tom Hiddleston portrayed the deceitful God of Mischief Loki very well, too. Anthony Hopkins was great as the wise and proud Warrior King Odin. Very good character choices, I thought.I was also quite pleased that the feelings Jane Foster and Thor had for each other was kept as a small plot point instead of taking a much larger role. They kept things focused on Thor and trying to return to Asgard, as they should have. Well done.Problems? Well, only a couple of minor things, really. They really should have explained what the Odinsleep was, because without knowing about it from reading the comics, a normal movie goer would have just seen Odin collapse, and then be told he couldn't continue on as the King of Asgard because he was 'in the Odinsleep'. Considering that being in the Odinsleep was the whole basis for Loki becoming King and thus causing a lot of the plot to commence, it really did bear some explanation. Also, I found that some of the fights were rather short. They were good, but when you see Thor, Loki, Sif and the Warriors Three take on a ton of Frost Giants and beat them pretty easily, and those are supposed to be some of the big villains in the movie, it kinda makes you take them less serious. Same with Destroyer. I was so stoked that he was in this movie: in fact, it was probably what I was most excited for. He decimated Sif and the Warriors Three, and then gives Thor a good smack, and then suddenly Mjolnir returns to Thor and Thor beats Destroyer in about 2 minutes. And the same happened to Loki. Loki manipulated everyone, masterminded the whole plan about getting the Frost Giants into Asgard through a secret passage and was playing both sides against the middle. He starts taunting Thor, and then when Thor finally fights him, the fight lasts about 5 minutes. A couple of blows back and forth, Loki makes some mirror images of himself and then its pretty much over. Had they made at least some of the fights go on a bit longer, particularly Loki, it would have gone a long way towards cementing the villains as really worthy opponents. At least Destroyer annihilated the Warriors Three and Sif, which made him seem pretty damn worthy, but Thor turning around and beating him pretty easily took away from that, I found.Aside from that, it was an entertaining film. There are lots of laughs to be had, (particularly the fish out of water type, as Thor has no clue how to properly act on Earth), the acting is very solid and the story is pretty good.",8,12,24,6 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I Hate Jokes that Aren't Funny
",".....and boy, was this movie full of them. True, the story was lacking, but I was expecting that going in (as so few sequels actually match or top the original). And since I despise Shia LaBeouf, I already knew that the acting would be sub-par. So really, there were no surprises for me going in....except an endless barrage of jokes (and I use the term VERY loosely) and situations which are apparently supposed to pass as 'humor'. Robot testicles, a pair of smack talking, black sounding robots, numerous sexual encounters, a mother acting like a mental patient after ingesting weed brownies, a grown man in a jock strap and, yes, even a couple of fart jokes. All those things are funny when you're about 9. After that you stop laughing and start saying 'dear god, this is pathetic'. I wouldn't mind humor in a Transformers movie, providing that its humor that is A) actually funny and B) a form of humor more sophisticated than god damn fart jokes! I can't even begin to tell you how those things (I refuse to acknowledge them as jokes) ruined this movie for me.I admit, the action is pretty cool, the CGI is amazing, I got to see the Constructicons form into Devestator (which was awesome, thank god they got it right this time) and I got to see my favorite Transformers character, Soundwave, on the big screen (including Ravage!). It was a shame that we didn't get to see Soundwave and the Constructicons for longer, but at least they were there.However, even though I did like some things, the insulting attempt at humor the movie made was absolutely unforgivable. If this is what is supposed to be funny, I cringe for the future of comedy. Whoever wrote this drivel needs to be horsewhipped.",6,3,9,27 June 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The Dark is Where This Should Have Been Kept
","I don't even know where to begin...I'm still speechless. I didn't think things could get worse after Revenge of the Fallen. Dear God was I mistaken. Horribly, horribly mistaken.This is more a game of questions if you ask me. Questions such as: 1)Who was it who ever sat down and said 'you know what, I think Michael Bay would be great to direct a Transformers trilogy!'? 2)Who exactly green lighted this 'script' (and believe me I use the term VERY loosely)? 3)What sort of barnyard animal is in charge that would ever, EVER consider that this movie was 'ok' to release to the public? 4)Who was the cretin that went to the studio bosses and told them 'we need a star for the new Transformers trilogy! Get me the kid from Even Stevens!'? 5)In what universe is Rose-Huntington whatever considered hot? These are but a few enigmas that plagued me throughout this...thing.I'll refrain from beating around the bush. The acting is horrifying. The story is non-existent, and whomever thought it would pass as being acceptable needs to be horsewhipped. The dialogue is atrocious. In all, one word can sum up this movie-laughable. This wasn't a movie, it was a nearly 3 hour joke that tried to be serious. I am embarrassed for anyone who worked on this project. I would be absolutely ashamed to have my name linked to something like this.Positives? The CGI was impressive, which is what earned this film 3/10 instead of the zero it so rightly deserved.A few other major problems this film had: Forgive my ignorance, but wasn't this supposed to be a franchise about robots in disguise? Then why is the movie 30% about robots and 70% about humans beings who a)I don't have any emotional connection to b)I couldn't care less about because they're preventing me from viewing the robots I paid to see and c)I honestly wished would die in every scene they appeared? Fast moving camera shots and large explosions tend to hinder people in their efforts to view what's going on in a movie. Especially during the fight scenes.In said fight scenes, its also hard to know who's who when the heroes and villains look almost exactly the same. That's kinda why you make people and things look different, so, you know, we can identify them...The title. 'In the Dark of the Moon' makes sense. 'Lunar Shadow' makes sense. 'Dark of the Moon' makes no sense. Even the title is bad.Even now, hours after viewing it, I'm still completely appalled by this movie. This isn't a bad movie by Transformers standards, its a bad movie by any standards.",Null,8,18,14 July 2011
