Come and See," Astonishing and powerful
","Come and See is an astonishing film that shows how a young boy ages in front of the camera. This young boy instead of being able to enjoy his youth, he grows up going through what an adult soldier goes through as if it was a grown man trapped in a kids body. It is a film where the plot is almost unpredictable. When I first saw it, I thought Flyora was going to get caught and be drag to a horrible place. In almost every scene I thought that he was going to either get killed or tortured. To my surprise, Flyora was never caught. Somehow out of experienced grown ups, this young boy survives to witness everything that surrounds him. This is a great film but at the same time it is a film that is painful to watch. It shows pretty harsh, yet true, scenes that makes you feel this nauseous feeling. Overall I consider this film as an eye opening to people that might have a different concept of what it is to fight in a real harsh war.",Null,1,1,3 August 2009
