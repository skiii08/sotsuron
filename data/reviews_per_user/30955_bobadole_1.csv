Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better then the first
","After watching the first movie I was like 'wow' and now the second came out and I left the theater not only speechless but wanting to see it over and over and over. It was that good. The only other movie that has come out recently that compares to Kill Bill vol. 2 is L.O.T.R. Return of the king. Now it might not be solid action like the first one which had the fight between the Bride and the Crazy 88, but instead we got cool scenes, a strong story line, and we learnt The Brides real name. Tarantino is one of the best movie directors and it shows in this movie. I can only hope he comes out with another soon.I hope this makes you want to see the movie because it is worth every penny.Have fun watching!",10,0,1,11 May 2004
