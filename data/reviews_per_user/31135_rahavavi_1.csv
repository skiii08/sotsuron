3:10 to Yuma," Awful, logic less , annoying
","I gave this 3 because the actors are great and the cinematography is too but the story doesn't make any sense. Wade keeps murdering people and reversing the tables but they never handcuff him or tie him up. Better yet shoot him and bring his body to wherever the hell they were going to hang him. It's doesn't make sense that they didn't do that after he killed the first man, even if you suspend your disbelief that they wouldn't have already shot him when they set out on the road. No living Wade- no problems from him and no gang trying to rescue him. I'm renaming this 310 to stupid nonsense with a gritty cast and good lighting. .",3,1,2,18 November 2016
