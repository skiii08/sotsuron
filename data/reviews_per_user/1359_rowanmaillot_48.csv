The Mask," Jim Carrey's Best Performance
","If this movie didn't come out in 1994, it would have been far more recognised! But because it came out the same year as Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Natural Born Killers, The Lion King, New Nightmare, The Crow and True Lies, they were getting all the talk. This movie shouldn't be recognised as the best film of 1994, but the best comedy of its decade. And no, they never made a sequel it doesn't exist (it does, but let's just forget about it, alright?). Overall it's an awesome comedy with a great performance by my man Jim Carrey.",10,0,0,12 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nothing like the previous three...
","Now hold your horses, this film is directed by George Lucas, the guy who force-fed ideas to Spielberg for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, whose ideas were shown in the final movie. If you guys read my previous review for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you will see that I was a very nice person and gave it a 7/10, one of my problems with that film was the story. You're probably sitting there like, a 6 star review for this piece of garbage? And, yes I can understand where you're coming from, you probably went into this film expecting 'A New Hope', 'Empire Strikes Back' or 'Return of the Jedi' that is not this movie!It is not the greatest work of 1999 and I understand people's problems with this film, some of the characters are repetitive and are given the same sort of lines and dialogue and it is flawed, yes. If you went into this film back in 1999 expecting the next 'Empire Strikes Back' you will be very disappointed, which is understandable, considering the first three were absolutely brilliant pieces of work and going into this you would've expected the next big thing and I understand where you're coming from, I was disappointed as well. When I was around 6 I would've given this film a 9/10, because I wasn't sure about movies back then, but watching it now, I see its flaws and it is a flawed movie.By all means this is no masterpiece, the C- grade is for the nostalgia and to be honest it is kind of entertaining. I know there are fans of the Episodes by George Lucas and there are some who prefer this over the first three and I'm not one of those fanboys, if one of my favourite filmmakers put out a bad film I will not defend it and stick up for it, I will give it the rating it deserves based on its issues and everything wrong with it. Call me a Nolan fanboy, I am, because he has never made a bad film and as far as I am concerned, will NEVER make a bad film! Anyways let's get back to the topic.The Phantom Menace was the first in the series of Lucas's Episodes for Star Wars, Roger Ebert's positive review for this movie isn't the only reason I give this movie a 6, it was one of the only positive reviews for this film back then by a well renowned critic. This is one of those films that have since developed a cult following and still remains divisive to this day. I don't really want to spoil this film, if you've never watched Phantom Menace, I recommend you check it out, without trying to think of it as one of those.60%",6,0,0,6 June 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Guy With That Cool Hat...
","Indiana Jones is possibly my favourite action/adventure movies and one of my top 50 movies of all time, not just because it's by Spielberg and I just love every single one of his films, this is a legit cult classic and Spielberg has a true stroke of genius.Back in the 70's, 80's and 90's this Spielberg guy couldn't stop making great films, of course Scorsese's still my favourite director but Spielberg was hitting all the high notes at the box office, he had one of the greatest composers (John Williams) working for him and he work with lots of talented people. This is the last time I will talk about this, but the only reasons I prefer Scorsese is that1. He doesn't need a big budget to make a fantastic film
2. Darker storytelling and hilarious black comedy
3. He still makes great films to this day
4. He has never made a BAD movieWith saying that, this movie is one of my favourites, our first scene to the film is possibly the most famous scene of all time! Indiana Jones entering the cave and him making it just in time, grabbing his hat putting it back on and keeps running, this scene within itself is already a movie. Spielberg directed one of the most stunning movies and one of my favourite musical scores, John Williams is the greatest composer working today and one of the greatest ever! Normally, in Spielberg's films the musical scores interrupt how great the film is and just keeps going throughout the entire movie, but this one doesn't feel like it is overstaying its' welcome. There is nothing to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, it's one of the most entertaining, kick-ass, huge budget awesomeness (in which category Spielberg really succeeds in).

It," It just works..
","Bill Skarsgard absolutely killed it as Penny-wise, the children cast was very entertaining, (especially Finn Wolfhard) the comedy is hilarious and I was actually scared of Penny-wise. Whereas with the 1990 TV movie, Penny-wise was portrayed as more of a comedic clown, but Bill still scares the living crap out of me every-time that I watch this movie. It's one of the greatest films of 2017 and possibly the greatest film of the 21st century (excluding Saw and Conjuring 1 & 2).I have read the book two times, it normally takes me around 1-2 days to finish the entire book, because it's around 1,138 pages worth, but I love it and enjoy it every-time! However, the ending of the book is slightly more stupid and I am glad they didn't take that route with It Chapter 1 & 2. It still fascinates me to this day that people can still make fantastic horror movies. The 70's, 80's and 90's ones still remain classics, but you've got your James Wan's and people who can still make great horror movies. It is definitely one of the better Stephen King adaptations.",10,1,1,22 June 2020
Memento," Just saw- One of my favorite movies of all time
","This is based on a novel by Jonathon Nolan (Chris Nolan's brother) and starring Australian actor Guy Pearce. Huge spoilers ahead: This movie works backwards, I feel like the movie wouldn't have made a-lot of sense without me knowing going in that the story would be told backwards, but I just saw this 7/02/2020 and boy oh boy is this a masterpiece.
Basically, Leonard Shelby has this incident when his wife is getting raped and murdered by two brutal attackers, Leonard hears her screams from the bathroom rushes in and tries to fight them off, but ends up getting his head smashed into a glass mirror, and then supposedly they leave. The story is that Leonard's wife survives, she is diagnosed with diabetes and he keeps injecting her with a needle but he forgets (due to his amnesia) that he is overdosing her with the drug, and she ends up dying of an overdose. Altogether, the story is original, unique and anything you would hope for in a psychological thriller.Even though the story is quite dark, there is a humour to it. For example, character Teddy is hilarious, making jokes about Leonard's condition. Overall, this is my favorite psychological thriller by far! Grade: A+",10,1,2,7 February 2020
Spider-Man 2," Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made...
","In my opinion. Sam Raimi is a BRILLIANT director, he proved that with The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness, A Simple Plan, Darkman and the first Spider-Man! Doctor Strange: in the Multiverse of Madness is my most anticipated movie and I hope it beats the original. J.K Simmons steals every single scene he is, it's one of my favourite supporting performances in cinema history! Kirsten Dunst is so good as Mary Jane Watson, James Franco's pretty good Toby Maguire owns Spider-Man as far as I'm concerned. This is next to The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II as one of my favourite Sam Raimi movies, Drag Me To Hell is pretty damn good as well.I recently got back into the Spider-Man movies by Sam after playing the Spider-Man game on PS4 (which is easily the best looking game I have ever played, and the most fun) and I got back into the spirit of the ultimate Sam Raimi trilogy. Unpopular opinion: I really like Spider-Man 3, you can go and see my review for that, I made it a few days ago. I think it is a very well done superhero movie but some ideas fall flat, still a great prequel. Spider-Man 2 is as close to perfect as superhero movies can be! All the performances are amazing, the script by David Koepp is great, the cinematography by Don Burgess is brilliant, it's everything a superhero movie should be.Grade: A+",10,0,0,17 June 2020
The Irishman," The *BEST* Movie of 2019
","No doubt, simply the best Netflix film ever made and the best movie of 2019.
Where do I even begin? This film is so entertaining and perfect, the run time of 3 hours and 30 minutes feels more like 2 hours and 45 minutes, because I was having a blast with every single scene. De Niro plays Frank Sheeran, he ends up getting involved in the mob which technically speaking destroys his life, his daughter thinks of Pacino's character Jimmy Hoffa more of a father to her. Frank gets involved in Joe Pesci's character which ends up with bad blood between the father and Peggy. She ends up accepting the fact he's part of the mob and goes out killing people, so she approaches Jimmy Hoffa as more of a father figure. The story has its fair share of sad moments, like when Pesci's character passes away, and most importantly the death of Jimmy Hoffa. Obviously, in real life, Frank never killed Hoffa himself, the case of who really killed Hoffa still remains a mystery, but Carlo Licata is the suspected murderer.
What is also amazing and unique about this film, is how when it introduces its characters like Angeleno Bruno, it addresses how they died. Also, its use of CGI, I wouldn't have noticed if I saw the film not knowing it was made by Scorsese, because it looks so realistic, it's actually fantastic! This is definitely my favourite of the decade, no doubt in my mind, there has been no other picture exploring such an in-depth real life story and that ahs had me as engaged as The Irishman did.

Home Alone," A Holiday Classic...
","I watch this movie when it's not even winter or Christmas, it's just such an enjoyable film to watch and if you don't at least appreciate it you do not understand the art of film. The highest grossing movie of 1990, and at the time the third highest grossing movie of all time, this movie had a lot of potential. But it was slammed by critics, although audiences seemed to enjoy it, and those exact same critics hating on it back then call it a 'Christmas classic' nowadays.If you didn't know and have been living under a rock for a large percentage of your life, Home Alone is a story about a kid who hates his parents and always thinks they're out to get him and make him seem like the bad guy when he's really not. We see Kevin get discriminated by his family and everyone else around him and can't stand seeing him get tortured by his family. This movie is so damn quotable, nearly every line Kevin says I say on a daily basis, 'When I grow up and get married I'm living alone, you hear me?! I'm living alone, I'm living alone!!'
Kevin wishes his family would disappear and we're sort of on the same path as him, the next day he sleeps in and completely forgets the family's trip to France which leads to, 'I made my family disappear'. What is so terrific about Joe Pesci's performance were his restrictions, he wasn't in a Martin Scorsese movie where he could say all the swear words under the blue moon, he was in a family movie which meant he could not swear and the exact same year Home Alone came out 2 months after Goodfellas, which shows how diverse Joe Pesci is.Is there anything I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a holiday classic, it's my favourite winter themed movie, my favourite Christmas movie, and my favourite performance from a child actor until Hugo came around. Grade: A+",10,0,0,22 February 2020
Spider-Man 3," Underrated? Yes! Flawed? Yes!
","But deserving of all its hate? NO! Spider-Man 3 is directed by Sam Raimi, that guy who made two of the greatest horror comedies and two of the greatest superhero movies (Army of Darkness, The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead 2 etc.) this film is definitely flawed. But while it has its issues, this film should definitely not be considered as one of the worst films ever made! Toby Maguire's Spider-Man will never be topped, Tom Holland's is more of a comedic relief Spider-Man, whilst the Sam Raimi's Toby Maguire Spider-Man is a much darker and serious Spider-Man.Sam Raimi has directed (what are considered) to be the greatest horror comedies of all time such as; The Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead, three of which I consider to be some of the greatest horror comedies of all time! So people definitely went into this film with high expectations considering that the first two Spider-Man films were considered by many critics and audiences to be two of the greatest superhero film efforts since Tim Burton's Batman films and others. And yes, it is disappointing if you go into it expecting the next big Batman Begins or whatever you're expecting it to be, but if you go into it expecting a flawed superhero masterpiece, you are in for a treat.It is flawed yes, but what movie isn't? Even epics like Jurassic Park, Psycho, Vertigo, The Dark Knight, Blade Runner and many others have flaws, but the excuse for most reviewers is that 'Sam Raimi is a great director' or 'I went into this expecting the next big thing' just stop! I have watched this film and yes I do have to say there is one character who feels unnecessary and that is Topher Grace's Venom. If he was played by another actor it would've been far much more interesting, it's definitely not Sam Raimi's best but definitely not his worst work.The story is about Peter Parker trying to leave his Spider-Man life and get into a bigger relationship with Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, except he sees something suspicious going on between her and James Franco's character, they get into a big fight and a lot of things happen. Eventually, Franco's character dies at the end which is one of the saddest deaths of the 21st century. Don't get me wrong, the first two are greater by a milestone, but Spider-Man 3 is underappreciated and it wasn't the big Spider-Man 2 people were expecting it to be, but it should be respected a bit more. To all those people reading the negative reviews, don't listen to other people, try it for yourself and then decide whether it's good or not.Literally nobody could've directed the Spider-Man trilogy other than Sam Raimi, the guy owns tens of thousands of comics so he went into this trilogy knowing what he was doing, it has cheesy scenes, cheesy dialogue, action-packed scenes and sure, it could've been better, but, whatever. All and all it's still a great superhero cheesy action flick and I'm going to give Spider-Man 3 an 82%",8,0,0,6 June 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," Best Motion Capture Work Ever!
","Let me just start off by saying, just like Catch Me If You Can this film has so much effort put just into the opening credits alone, Steven Spielberg puts SO MUCH effort into all of his work and you definitely can see it in this movie, too! The motion capture looks so realistic that after a while I even forgot it was a motion capture movie. Just like some of Spielberg's other work, this film has developed a cult following since its release which is VERY understandable.We get into the plot of the film and this is when it gets really interesting, Tintin purchases a ship for a pound at a market and this item, supposedly, has a lot of background history, Tintin goes to a library and researches about the ship and discovers that it was a replica of a ship made in the late 16th century, but just as Tintin returns home, he comes back to discover that his ship had been stolen by a man at the market who said bad things happen when people take hold of this item. He goes to the Marlinspike Hall, a big bulky dog comes chasing after Tintin and his puppy, but Tintin's dog toughens up and they become friends.Tintin enters the Marlinspike hall through a window, little does he know that our antagonist, Sakharine, Red Rackham, played by Daniel Craig and his supervisor are staying in this place protecting the first original ship. Our protagonist then gets knocked out by an old man, Nestor, he finds out that the ship Red Rackham has in the Marlinspike Hall is not his, it was a second one which Sir Francis made and they're both identical. I could study this film all day and never get bored because of how much of a fun time it is and it has also got to be my favourite film of the decade!Score: 10/10",10,0,0,18 May 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 'Mein Führer, I Can Walk!'
","King of Comedy and A Clockwork Orange used to be my favourite black comedies but now I have found THE ONE. Doctor Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest and most influential director of all time! Stanley Kubrick was a young controversial director who had met with topics of World War 1, Boxers, Robbers, Spartacus, A man going out with his daughter, so he had his fair share of controversy and did even more so in the years to come. Stanley Kubrick's dark sense of humour works so well in this movie, Peter Sellers plays three roles, one as a British executive officer for Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper, the American President Merkin Muffley and Nazi Scientist Doctor Strangelove. He was originally going to play a fourth role but was replaced by Slim Pickens.
It is so strange that this movie is PG, the mentions of bodily fluids, dirty sense of humour between Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and his 'assistant' (totally nothing else) Miss Scott. Malcolm McDowell said Stanley Kubrick had the dark and most sick sense of humour that most people can get, but select few don't, and this is where it shines. Peter Sellers' Nazi voice impression is so great and hilarious, and this movie is so believable like most of Kubrick's work.
The cinematography and script are on point. Kubrick's direction and production design is once again beautiful like it is with any other Kubrick movie. Not only is this my favourite war movie, it is also quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen! Acting: 10/10 Production design: 10/10 Kubrick's direction: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Dark comedy: 10/10

Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The greatest slasher film and musical!
","This film is so edgy, bloody, comedic and everything I could expect from a Tim Burton flick! It's a heck of a lot of fun and one of his most enjoyable films yet! It's up there as one of his most violent films he has ever made, right there next to Sleepy Hollow. Heads don't roll in this absolute masterpiece of a slasher film, necks get sliced and Sweeney Todd is out in London to get revenge on the person who did this to his wife. He claims 'Benjamin Barker is dead, it's Todd now, Sweeney Todd.'It's one of the greatest performances in a Tim Burton movie and also one of my favourite performances ever in cinematic history. I first saw this movie when I was 10 and I had nightmares, my neck always felt weird when Depp was slashing throats and still does. 'At last...my arm is complete again.' I love the feel of this film, the weather, you can feel it, Tim Burton always uses the camera like a master, all of the shots could be hung up on your bedroom wallpaper because of how beautiful they are.So many characters in this film are intimidating and you feel like beating them the heck up. We get introduced to several characters, villains, including Alan Rickman's character, Timothy Spall and many others. This is one of my top 10 movies, it is so genius and everything about it screams perfection.",10,0,0,30 May 2020
Taxi Driver," 'You Talkin' To Me?'
","Beautiful violence. After Clockwork Orange I'd say this was a controversial movie, this movie hit headlines everywhere. So buckle your seat-belts and prepare for a disturbing, dark piece of art called Taxi Driver. Let's talk about the scene that caused a lot of drama, the scene where Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is at the Charles Palantine campaign and attempts to shoot the 'future president' but the secret service man runs after him and doesn't catch him. Which inspired the shooting of Ronald Reagan, although the bullet barely missed him, hitting McCarthy instead (who sacrificed himself, with a bullet hitting him in the chest and one to the lung). The attempted assassination was done to impress Jodie Foster, the most talked about part of the movie is towards the end where Travis puts his bloody finger to his head and utters the famous lines, 'pew, pew, pew'. Does he survive? Yes, he was in a coma for a while and got back out well and recuperating. Does he get arrested? No, because he basically just murdered a bunch of criminals/pimps (being a pimp against the law). It's a timeless classic and just gets better with every viewing. Grade: A+",10,2,4,25 January 2020
Shutter Island," Best Film of the Decade...
","68% on Rotten Tomatoes, really?This movie has multiple meanings but at times it is hard to explain the meaning because you can't find the words to describe it. So I'm going to try and keep it easy to understand.At the beginning we see our main character, Teddy Daniels a.k.a. Andrew Laeddis (as we find out towards the end) throwing up on a ferry saying it's because he is seasick, but now I get it. He is throwing up because he so horrified by his past, his wife killing his three children by drowning them and him shooting her in the stomach that he gets sick every now and then. Ben Kingsley's character says that Dr Sheehan is overseas, which we find out is actually Andrew's psychiatrist for Shutter Island. His disguise name is Chuck Aule and he tries to play the part as Daniel's buddy in this new situation.Close to the introduction of the film, we see the cops handling rifles when Daniels gets out from the ferry, this is because he is a dangerous patient and we have no idea when he is just going to get mad and kill somebody. He has had a short temper ever since the death of his wife and his three children. When you first watch the movie, you don't realise why the cops could be handling the rifles when Teddy is around, that is the genius of Scorsese. Second time around, you notice something odd about the way people act around Andrew, they're scared of him, they try to act civil around him but the freak out!The one scene where Teddy and Chuck are interviewing patients and he comes across that one female that seems fine, he asks her, 'Have you ever seen a patient called Andrew Laeddis?' she answers back, frightened, 'Nope, never heard of him' and runs out crying, that is because she is legitimately afraid of him.And if you pay real close attention the name that Teddy gives his wife, Rachael Solando and the detective name he gives himself Teddy Daniels spells out the real names of the two.

Corpse Bride," Another one of Burton's masterpieces..
","Written perfectly with some of the most impressive special effects I've seen in the past 30 years. One of the most well made movies ever, not just animated movie, it has a strong cast, strong direction in the hands of Tim Burton and Mike Johnson and an intriguing story. Having come off Planet of the Apes, Burton had to really make a great movie and he proved he could, a future masterpiece and deserves a far higher score on IMDB.This and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory came out the same year, Chocolate Factory was more of a movie for fans of the book and not the original movie, it was not a reboot or a remake, it was a re-imagining and in my opinion, as a die-hard fan of the book, it was much better than the original and I pretty sure plenty of the other hundreds of thousands fans of the book felt the exact same way.This is a gothic masterpiece and is quite possibly my favourite all-time movie, not just animated. It's a creative, creepy movie that I respect so dearly and forever will, because of how it shaped my childhood, like most of Burton's work. It is the greatest film of 2005, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a very close second. In every way, this film is perfect, I picked up absolutely zero flaws watching this. It's hilarious, sad, depressing, dark, happy and literally everything else you could think of.Johnny Depp's character, Victor, basically is an awkward individual who is getting married to a total stranger played by Emma Thomas (Victoria) and he goes into the woods and practises how he is going to propose to Victoria by putting a ring on a supposed stick of wood, only to find out that it is the hand of a skeleton portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter. This film is a story of life and death and life beyond death.Victoria is forced by her parents to marry Lord Barkis played by Richard E. Grant, which is where a massive fight breaks loose at the end of the film. It is absolutely hilarious! My favourite line being, 'There's an eye in me soup.'",10,0,0,29 May 2020
The Aviator," one of my personal favourite films of the 2000's
","Not only is this one of the best films of the 2000's it is also one of my favourite movies ever made (if you check my top 55 movies list). Now this isn't a film you'll pop in the DVD player and just watch, it's a film you'll probably ever watch once because it is very time consuming and trust me I felt the length at times. Even though you may feel the length at times that is due to Martin Scorsese's excellent work in this movie, it changes colour for each time period, it is one of the most realistic biopics I've seen and Leo's performance...The performance given by Leo is one in a million and one of my favourites ever given by an actor and this movie proves that Scorsese has still got that spirit in him to keep making epic after epic after epic after epic.Aviator is based on director/producer Howard Hughes who got really sick and had a lot of mental issues and health problems after his plane crashing for testing of a film, he made it out alive but with serious injuries, a broken spine, collapsed heart, temporary deafness and extremely blurry vision. This accident completely ruined his whole life but he fought through it and is a true survivor. Do I need to say anything more? Roger Ebert gave this a 4/4 and it was loved by critics on its initial release and is considered a classic for many years to come.Now, I don't want to make this review too long and bore you to death, but I will definitely recommend this movie to any true film lover out there. Grade: A+",10,0,0,1 March 2020
The Color of Money," Can the ending be explained?
","Yes, this is an amazing movie and yes I understand the positive reviews, but what the heck does the ending mean? Does Eddie end up beating Vince, or does Vince beat Eddie?
Saying that, the narration in the beginning by Scorsese is superb, while I do think he should've narrated the entire film I think it was a better option to just have him narrate the first part of the movie. Roger Ebert famously didn't like this movie, and I can understand his review, even though I love the movie and think it's a cult classic Ebert had some points I took into consideration.A great follow up to the 60's classic, 'The Hustler' and Scorsese's narration in the beginning and the story just makes it the even more compelling. This film was commercially successful back in 1986, although critics Siskel and Ebert thought the story was so predictable, other critics seemed to enjoy it, with 89% on Rotten Tomatoes and an Oscar for Paul Newman's performance, the movie received fairly well criticism.If you're looking for a fun pool-table movie with some swear words and mature storytelling, you will enjoy this film. But if you're a die-hard fan of the original you'll just find this one amazing.

Hugo," Best & Most Fun Experience In A While
","After a lot of violent and bizarre flicks, Martin makes a genius film about one of the first ever (and most inspiring) movie-makers Georges Méliès, which was made for his daughter and all cinema lovers. Very smart and intelligent, at times dark and comedic and also manages to be different genres at the same time. Sacha Baron Cohen is the train inspector ho is hilarious and has a thrilling performance. Later on in the film, someone calls the train inspector saying that the older clock-worker had passed away, so now they're trying to figure out who is working them. All the scenery is rather breathtaking, the visual and camera angles make you feel like you're there witnessing all this with the main character.

The Shining," Obviously the Best Horror Film of all Time!
","Let me just sum this entire film up in one word for you... PERFECT!! A lot of people say Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson, while that may be true you still couldn't have picked somebody better for the role. This is my favorite horror film, Jack delivers one of my top 10 performances of all time, one of my top 10 movies of all time and ever so slightly better than A Clockwork Orange (2001: A Space Odyssey not included, because that film is flawless up to par with Shining.) I can proudly say I have watch this film at least 15 times and it just gets scarier and scarier every single time I watch it, I find more hidden secrets and Shelley Duvall's performance is extremely underrated and I believe it is one of the best performances from a female ever put on screen. 99.9% of people mostly remember this film for the iconic, 'Here's Johnny!' but there is so much more to it than that. Stephen King refers to this film as a beautiful car with no motor inside, now I 100% disagree with everything Stephen King says, good job Stanley for getting your copy of 'The Shining' and throwing it in the trash. The movie is better than the book and I will stick to those words till the day that I die (sorry Stephen King fans.) You know what this is gonna get.... A+",10,1,2,21 January 2020

Edward Scissorhands," When Tim Burton Was A Master
","No doubt about it, this movie is a Christmas classic, if you can really call it that. It's dark and gritty, the story is detailed and fun, Johnny Depp's performance is an outstanding effort, I wish Tim Burton still directed films this good. Tim was on a streak, he had done Pee Wee, Beetlejuice and Batman all critically acclaimed, all of his older films are like classics to me, too bad he is wrapped up in doing crappy remakes and average Disney movies nowadays. To be honest, this is proof you don't need a lot of blood and gore in a dark movie, Psycho proved that to everyone. Spoiler time: The scene when Edward stabs Jim with his scissorhands is just epic, and I've got to admit that the whole fight sequence between Kim, Ed and Jim is ultimate and perfect filmmaking.

","Sure you've got Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and all those other war flicks, but this film is much deeper and explores the war more seriously, not only is this the greatest war movie ever made but it's also my second favourite film of the 90's (#1 being Schindler's List) the fact that this also feels like it could be a documentary on the actual WW2 because of how realistically it is made and how terribly horrific the world war really was. Tom Hanks' role feels so realistic and so believable and he's such a lovable guy.We start off with the Omaha Beach scene which is shot so realistically (which you will hear me say around 50 times) and the amount of deaths and blood in this scene truly is scary and is truly the reason why Spielberg is such a great filmmaker and why he is absolutely my favourite filmmaker of all time! The score gives me goosebumps and is one of John Williams' best, unlike other war films, it doesn't dumb down in the second and third act, instead, I believe, this film has the greatest second and third act I've ever seen! Spielberg does not shy away from the results of war and the impact is has on society and human beings as a hole. If I literally had a tear jar for how many times I cried during this movie it would be full and overflowing, this film has one of the greatest ensemble casts ever and I'd be lying if I said Hanks' performance outshines everything else in the movie, because the greatest performance in this film is the war and how it is portrayed.It is based on a true story of four brothers, 3/4 of the brothers had been killed on battlefield and one of them is still alive, however, the mission is not as easy as it seems, first of all, imagine the grief of the mother and the misery she would be going through if she found out all of her sons had been killed, which means she has to have at least one to survive. There are some subtle moments of comedy which could be used to brighten the mood, but it still never shies away from the fact of how bad war was.The film gets more depressing and terrifyingly believable as it goes along, they come across another Ryan, James Frederick Ryan from Minnesota, but they're looking for James Francis Ryan from Iowa, then Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) and Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) have a conversation in a Church about some kid back where they used to live and talk about him, I guess, to try and brighten the mood, they tell stories and go to sleep for a while before going for another trip to find James Francis Ryan.Another one of his guys had just been killed off by a German, Captain Miller decides not to kill him, 'Because every man I kill makes me feel further from home.' They eventually find Private Ryan and tell him about the tragic deaths of his three other brothers, they say he can go home, although displaying an emotional response at first, Ryan still wants to fight the war, saying he doesn't wish to abandon the team. The third and final act is sad to say the least, all the characters we loved earlier on in the film end up getting killed in battle, we are now back to Omaha Beach style war.Great movie",10,0,0,20 May 2020
1941," I'm With The 1%
","This film is reviled by lots of people and to me I can't really understand. It is a fun, action-packed, war comedy adventure, the comedy is hilarious and childish, but I nearly fell off of my seat because I was laughing so much, it doesn't go without its flaws, one thing that pissed me off about this movie is that John Belushi has such little screen-time, because it is close to being one of the most hilarious characters ever put on screen.I have many reasons, I give 1941 an 8.6, first of all, I have a very twisted sense of humour and that is exactly what this film delivers. the first scene we get is a parody of Spielberg's Jaws, except, the naked lady is swimming in a lake and then a giant Russian boat comes along and picks her up, which is when we get our first hilarious scene. We then get introduced to some more interesting characters, Dan Aykroyd's performance is definitely the highlight of the film for me, it is one of those films I can rewatch over and over and never get bored of it because it is so goddamned entertaining to watch.The word underrated for this film is definitely an understatement, in fact, I'd consider this film to be over-hated. My review for this film could last forever, since I have so many great memories of this film, in fact, I nearly fell into watching it a second time immediately after I had just watched it the first time and that's saying something. Just talking about this movie makes me want to walk all the way to a store and buy some chips to eat while watching this.86/100",8,0,0,16 May 2020
Aladdin," The Live Action Cat In the Hat Of 2019
","A year of good films... OH NO NOT WILL SMITH! So in this film we get an utterly disturbing blue and unfunny character called... Blue Will Smith, that's it. We don't touch the originals, OK? I think we've all learned by now, The Cat in the Hat was better left alone, Pet Semetary was better left alone,The Lorax was better left alone. Thankfully, Guy Ritchie redeemed himself with The Gentlemen (Matthew McConaughey) this film tries to be funny but ends up being scary, I can't get the image of a blue Will Smith out of my head. Sad thing is Will Smith is the only entertaining part, even though he looks like a complete CGI mess that Bo Welch would do high on Cat in the Hat. Grade: D-",7,1,5,10 June 2019
Schindler's List," Greatest Film Ever Made!
","Schindler's List is absolutely flawless, from the cinematography to the score, to the absolutely realistic performances, this film is the true MASTERPIECE of the 90's. It's a three hour movie about the holocaust, which if I'm being 100% honest with you, feels more like 1 hour and 50 minutes, it's almost too short, this film could never have a remake, it is one of those golden films you should never try to approach again. Oskar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson) is basically a rich Nazi, who has Jew workers because they make more money than the Germans, let me start off by saying this easily the most realistic and greatest performance ever put on screen! When I talk about this film, I cannot help but smile, because films that are this perfectly made and top tier always make me feel proud that Spielberg exists. E.T. was the movie that made me love movies, Jurassic Park was a movie that made me want to make movies and Schindler's List is a movie that made me care much more about cinema. I want to talk about this movie for as long as I can, so buckle up for a long review.Schindler's List is about the holocaust, Stanley Kubrick was originally going to take the project, but his extensive research made him depressed and it was also a movie with a happy ending, which with most of Kubrick's work is not the usual way he likes to go with it, so he gave the project to his good friend, Steven Spielberg! Kubrick was so fascinated by Jurassic Park and said he had been looking to capture someone a film that's not real as realistically as Spielberg did, so you could tell they had a friendship. He also loved E.T and more of Spielberg's work, so he trusted him with the project and it ended up being the greatest film ever. Every thing is on point, it feels more like a documentary from the 1940's holocaust than it does a film, and the performances don't even feel like performances, they feel like the real thing. Schindler basically saved 1,100 Jews, so if that's not enough to say that he's a hero, then I don't know what is!Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goeth, but to be honest with you, it feels more like Amon Goeth is playing Amon Goeth because of how realistic the performances really feel, every scene is perfectly shot, but the one thing I cannot understand is that it has an M rating in Australia, this film literally has around 500 naked people, around three sex scenes, 100 f-bombs, strong violence and little kids being killed by the Nazis and that is not deserving of an R rating? Nonetheless, all of the things about this film are absolutely perfect and it is the greatest film ever made!Great film",10,0,1,20 May 2020
The Evil Dead," A horror masterpiece..
","I rarely ever say I have an actual favourite horror movie, I've always had multiple (The Shining, Psycho, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream, Halloween, The Thing, The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Insidious Chapter 1 & 2) but two that have always remained my favourites are Saw and Evil Dead. Especially Saw, I just love that movie so much (and I'll have a review up soon for that.) Because both of these movies were made with a shoestring budget, yet they ended up changing horror as we know it.The Evil Dead is very disturbing, there are some scenes that make you feel so scared, this isn't just any normal horror movie, this shaped the genre for haunted house movies in the middle of nowhere made with a small budget. It proves you don't need to make a big horror blockbuster like Jaws in order to make an amazing horror flick! Of course as the Evil Dead franchise got bigger, the budget increased for each movie, but the sequels to the original Evil Dead are possibly even better.4/4 : One of my all time favourites",10,0,0,17 June 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," An Easter Classic..
","If you are a fan of the original, you will probably not like this film that much, but if you view it through the lens of entertainment, visuals and you loved the book and weren't too much of a fan of the original you will love this movie, same goes for me. To start off with, this movie has a magic, beautiful score composed by Danny Elfman, the chocolate makes me starved everytime I watch it. It has amazing visuals, a very strong cast, and unlike some child performances, Highmore was not annoying at all, Johnny Depp of course steals the show as always.It starts off with Grandpa Joe telling a story of Willy Wonka building a chocolate palace for an Indian, but it melted one day and fell down on top of them. Willy Wonka was facing problems of people stealing his ingredients and the way that he did things so he decided to close down the factory. The story and film is so close to the book that I nerded out in multiple scenes! It was dark and gritty, hilarious, as is always the case with a Tim Burton film, everything about this film made me feel proud (as a Roald Dahl and Tim Burton fan). Wonka decides to sell Wonka bars and only 5 people an get one and there are millions of people all over the world, so it is a bit unfair. Charlie ends up getting the last golden ticket, he runs home and tells his parents and grandparents that he found the final ticket. Grandpa Joe gets up and starts dancing because he is taking Charlie to the chocolate factory to meet the infamous Willy Wonka! Charlie says a lady at the store offered him $500 for the golden ticket and says somebody else would be able to offer more and they needed the money more than they needed the chocolate. His other grandfather, Grandpa George says there are only five golden tickets in the entire world and says money gets printed everyday, implying that going to the chocolate factory would be a one of a kind experience! George says if you don't go you are a dummy for giving up something that will only happen once in his entire life for money, Charlie ends up going with his Grandpa Joe to the marvellous extravaganza.Before entering the chocolate factory they get a performance from moving dolls singing, Wonka gets introduced to the visitors and says how great the finale of the song was. 'Good morning, starshine! The earth says hello!' this is when Johnny Depp's brilliant sense of humour comes into the mix. People say he talks a bit too much like Michael Jackson and I am starting to get a bit of it, that does not excuse his tremendously hilarious performance.",10,0,0,30 May 2020
Silence," Superior Filmmaking
","This is definitely not a movie you would pop into the DVD player on a normal night, it is quite distressing and hard to watch at times, which is literally the point of this film. But this isn't like your typical Scorsese distressing and disturbing film, it feels more like it was filmed like a documentary more than an actual movie, which is extremely difficult to achieve. Scorsese said he wanted to make this around 27 years ago, but it kept getting held back by all of his other work.
This film actually comes to a point where this literally does not feel like acting, it feels like more of what would actually happen if you went on this mission. So, let's get to the story, it's about a man played by Liam Neeson called Father Ferreira, he has apparently denounced his religion in public and Fr. Rodrigues and Fr. Garrpe played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, are sent to check if this is true, then, all of a sudden, it becomes a big quest and instead of this being an easy mission, it turns into a gigantic rush.
Adam Driver's character ends up sacrificing himself to save the people they are drowning and ends up dying, which mean Rodrigues is all by himself. He ends up finding Father Ferreira and tells Sebastian the story of why he had to leave his beliefs or else he would've died. Eventually, the same thing ends up happening to Garfield's character and he lives the rest of his life not sure about his beliefs, but dies with a cross on his chest.
At the end, you are left with an extremely well-made film, which you should expect from Scorsese anyways.",10,1,1,2 May 2020
The Dark Knight," 'I Believe Whatever Doesn't Kill You Simply Makes You...Stranger!'
","Well, where should I start? Well, um... this movie is FREAKING awesome. Heath Ledger's iconic Joker, without Heath Ledger this movie would be (not trash, but just not as good.) The action in this film is amazing and Christopher Nolan is a genius director, mix those two together and you get the best Batman (and one of the best) movies of all time. Fun fact time: Heath Ledger locked himself in an apartment all by himself screaming at walls and looking at pictures of Alex from A Clockwork Orange to really capture the craziness of the joker. He also bought all the Joker make-up from a local drug store and came up with the design, what a legend!Acting: 10/10. Art and direction: 10/10. Joker: 10/10. Batman: 10/10. Action: 10/10",10,1,2,8 October 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Most Genius Film
","Dawn of Man:Let's start off with the iconic score once the ape discovers a bone, there is a hidden meaning behind this scene, suggesting that Ape found something that could be used as a weapon. We then see the Apes using the bones as weapons to threaten the other side, telling them to get off their territory. We then get the beautiful transition of when the Ape throws the bone up into the sky and it turns to some sort of nuclear device.HAL 9000:We then get into an actual storyline, our new lead characters are Dave Bowman, Frank Poole and the infamous bad guy, HAL 9000. HAL 9000 and Frank Poole get into a game of chess, we see HAL cheat in a way, by reading Poole's lips and seeing what his strategy is. HAL gets into a conversation with Dave Bowman and says he has realised that there are some extremely odd things about the mission and says maybe him and Frank are not up for it.HAL is completely normal up until the point where Frank and Dave have a discussion about shutting down HAL, they find a way to talk in a space where he can't hear, but HAL can read lips which means he technically 'hears' the entire conversation. In most Kubrick films we have an intelligent character, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange or Danny in The Shining, but in this film , it's technology that outsmarts man.JUPITER:The last fifteen to twenty minutes still confuse and disturb young viewers, what does it all mean? We see different sorts of textures and stars and it left audiences speechless upon initial viewing. However what we are seeing is Bowman gong through space, seeing a variety of images that may unsettle younger viewers, this is why it is the most mature G- rated film ever made and the most unique and terrifyingly accurate story for our meddling tendencies.Do I need to say more? This is my personal favourite science fiction film and one of my favourite films, full stop, end of story.",10,0,0,8 May 2020
A Clockwork Orange," 'A Real Horrorshow'
","The greatest movie by the greatest director. Seriously, every shot in this movie is beautiful, sometimes the disturbing scenes are even laughable. Like the fight between Billy Boy's droogs and Alex's droogs is violent but almost comical, the Singing in the Rain scene is disturbing but playful because of the way Alex dances, he treats it like it's just his everyday job (which it is.) When this movie came out it was way ahead of its time, but it was only preparing us for what would happen in the years to come. This is not only a great Crime, Drama Satire, it is also the greatest futuristic/science fiction horror psychological thriller, this film is every genre all masterfully put together by Kubrick (the greatest director.) If there was no Clockwork Orange there would be no Natural Born Killers, Trainspotting, Fight Club, none of these movies would exist without Kubrick which makes him the master of all (and I mean ALL) films.Kubrick's movie starts with Alex sipping from a glass of Moloko Plus which has three key ingredients (drugs) vellocet, synthomesc and drencrom, which would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence. Not only is this one of the most horrifying, bone trembling, scariest, well acted, greatest scenes in cinematic history, the cinematography is beautiful and the closest you could come to hearing the most perfect dialogue ever spoken by a non-famous actor. When this came out it pushed the boundaries on what could be seen and what could not be seen on a screen, back then movies were harmless things to watch if you wanted to have fun or a good ride, but this film took movies to a whole new level. Sure there were films before it like: Who's That Knocking at my Door?, Psycho and Marnie which had subtle hints of nudity, sex and violence, but this was the first one that was THIS controversial, and since that date of January 13th 1972 no film has been as controversial.People were blaming this movie for inspiring them to sing, 'Singing in the Rain' while raping and beating a couple, people were caught wearing white clothing with bowler hats and black boots while beating up elderly people and blaming on the movie saying that 'Clockwork Orange' made them do it. Despite its initial controversy, critics seemed to love it. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing, so, pretty well received. I will add more to this review in the future since I believe this movie has a lot to talk about and lots of background history. Even though this film isn't considered a horror film, it is scary to say the least, at times it feels overwhelming, but covers all that up with its great satire, at times too dark for younger audiences, but myself, a 13 year old, understood the comedy and humour and enjoyed it.Needless to say, this film was snubbed at the oscars. Malcolm McDowell should've won best actor and Kubrick DEFINITELY should've won Best Screenplay, Best Picture and Best Director, it truly was Oscar-worthy, but I guess X- rated movies never win at the Academy. This is my favourite movie of all time!",10,1,2,21 January 2020

War of the Worlds," Very cool action blockbuster!
","The first two acts of this film are absolutely revolutionary and they should be respected as one of the greatest second and third acts ever in film history! Steven Spielberg, David Koepp and Tom Cruise's epic team up for this film is great, the story is well done, the lighting in this film is over-blown and can feel a tad bit unnecessary at times, but I guess Spielberg was trying to approach a more retro-y type appeal. All of the action and alien invasion scenes are epic and are really entertaining, at times this film really just feels like a compilation of great scenes because of how many there are!This came out the same year as Munich, although I think Munich is better, War of the Worlds was definitely one of the better films of the 2000's. In my opinion, the third act has minor flaws and I guess they should be discussed before you recommend this film to your friend. The whole thing where Ray Ferrier's (Tom Cruise) son, played by Justin Chatwin, decides he wants to go to the war and see the cool alien and all that sort of stuff, but what's so stupid about it is that he is going with no weaponry or any sort of tools. Once again, that's just a minor flaw and it isn't really relevant to the film's story.
Tom Cruise's performance is brilliant and one of the greatest things about this film is the family dynamic and excellent casting choice, and I have to admit, there are so many great scenes in this movie, that it kind of feels like a compilation of great scenes all in one movie.The special effects are so masterful, it's one of the greatest sci-fi action blockbusters ever! You can say I'm a Spielberg fanboy, go ahead, call me a Spielberg fanboy, I appreciate great cinema, shoot me! The explosive effects (just like the ones in Saving Private Ryan) are spectacular and perfectly fit the dramatic aspect of the film, there is one scene in this film very reminiscent of the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park, it's very suspenseful and fits the tone amazingly well!This is a visually stunning film, the fact that I wasn't alive to see it in the theatres really pisses me off because of how much of a great visual experience it was. The third act of this film could be defined as terrible, not so great or plain bad, I'll go with the second option since I don't believe it 100% RUINS the entire film, but it could've had another ending that was more likeable.War of the Worlds is the pinnacle of how a great visual movie can be made and is the greatest alien invasion ever made! This film is not 'underrated', when something is underrated it is not watched by many and less appreciated, but War of the Worlds is watched by many and people are starting to appreciate it. It also features one of John Williams' greatest scores.Score: 9.5/10",9,0,1,21 May 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," 'Literally A **** Ton of Money'
","Let's just start of by saying, why didn't Martin win oscar for best director and picture of the year, obviously Leo should've won for best actor and a leading role and Margot Robbie definitely should've won best supporting actress. This is a very fun ride, my sides were aching from all my laughter, the comedy is consistent throughout the whole movie, definitely my favorite film of the decade (no doubt). Jonah Hill's first role that made me realise this man can act, he is hilarious and adds to the film's greatness. The sex scene between Naomi and Jordan is comedy at its' peak, Margot has my favorite female performance of all time. SPOILER TIME: There's a great scene where Jonah Hill's character meets Jordan, claims that he lives in his apartment with two kids and the 'ugly wife' and this sets up his character, from then on he's absolutely brilliant. One scene which made me laugh so hard I coughed was when Jordan deals with the side effects of ludes and jeez is this scene excellent.Hands down one of my favourite films of all time!

Jaws," A classic but in my eyes..
","After Duel, I think that Steven was taking some sort of drug. When I say that, I mean it in a good way. Like, frick! How can you be able to make one flawless movie followed by another flawless movie followed by another flawless movie. Not only that, but his unique movie ideas sometimes make me wonder what the heck Spielberg is thinking and what way he is thinking. All hail Steven Spielberg.",10,1,3,26 June 2019
Dark Shadows," A Fun Dark Comedy With A Few Problems
","Tim Burton was possibly the best choice to direct a film like this. You look at the description of this film and it was like it was already made for him, OK, I'll admit I had a fun time, but no movie is without its' flaws and this has quite a few. But, when it's around the Halloween season, this is one of the movies I ALWAYS put on with no fail. Sure, call me one of those Burton suck-ups, whatever, yes, I'm a fan of quality entertainment, shoot me! This film gets put below his other masterpieces like Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, Big Fish and Nightmare Before Christmas, but it was never trying to be any of those things, what it was trying to be was a dark comedy with hilarious scenes and horrendously creepy moments, it was never trying to be the next 'Beetlejuice' Burton went for a different type of story and I LOVE IT!No movie goes without flaws, of course and this one has a few, but I don't realise them because I am so wrapped up into the story and how damned entertaining the movie was! Tim Burton is the most visionary mind working in filmmaking today and to see he can still make entertaining movies really excites me! Once I watch this or the twentieth time, I will add my full thoughts on the movie, but to be honest with you I can't really remember since I last saw it around last year Halloween, so I'll be back again soon!",6,0,0,26 January 2020
Inception," The Greatest Film of the Decade!
","Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. Though I wouldn't compare them, that doesn't mean I don't think this is better than all of them combined, because it is, what Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory. Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly filmmaking at it's greatest! Acting- 10/10 Special Effects- 10/10 Direction- 10/10 Production Design- 10/10",10,2,3,8 February 2020
The Terminal," Ultimate Feel-Good Movie
","The Terminal is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as a man trapped in a Terminal. The story is quite unique and Spielberg definitely knows when there's a unique story around and he takes a piece of the action. Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) goes to a terminal to catch a flight to New York, but his country is denied, being told by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) that his country doesn't exist anymore because of the big war going on in their country. Victor doesn't really understand English, but learns it by purchasing and borrowing books from stores, his character is so hilarious and lovable that it makes the film all that much better.We get introduced to other interesting characters like Gupta Rajan (Kumar Pallana), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna) who takes interest in Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana) and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is interested in Victor Navorski, but has a lover. Victor is stuck in this terminal for a total of nine months, Dixon trying to make him escape just for him to get caught by security guards (Victor doesn't fall or it). Hanks then smartly figures out a way to get quarters to pay for Burger King so he can eat quality food, however Frank ends up making restrictions so only the guards can do it.Hanks' character ends up getting a painting job and takes Warren on a small date, they both throw their beepers into a nearby lake. After nine months, Victor has been hiding the reason he wants to come to New York, he tells Amelia that his father who passed away, had a wish for his son to get all three (or four) signatures from Sax members and the last one is Benny Golson. The guards end up letting Navorski pass, meaning that he ends up going to get the last signature.It's a happy movie with a unique task that only Spielberg could master. Grade: A+",10,0,0,17 May 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Something With Stephen King Prison Movies Just Works
","There is just some thing with Stephen King and prison movies like The Green Mile just works. It is quite disappointing that the best Stephen King movies are the ones like Stand By Me, this, and The Green Mile, including the 2017 IT which did not disappoint. This is on my Top movies list, it's Morgan Freeman, it screams the book, but better. Frank Darabont is a great director, and this a freaking great movie. So great it makes movies like Pet Sematary look like a crappy 80's movie.",10,1,1,5 October 2018
Raging Bull," Not only the best boxing movie...
","This is my second favourite movie ever made so let's just get right into it. Raging Bull is directed by the absolute master (that is) Martin Scorsese and stars (personally) my favourite actor, Robert De Niro, his film career is so diverse and brilliant, his role as, Jake LaMotta (former heavyweight champion) just adds a completely clean essence to the film. Based on a true story about 40's to 50's champ Jake LaMotta, a story of a middleweight champion who wants to be up there with the highest boxers but say he can't because he had 'girly hands' (as he refers to them as). He wants to become a heavyweight champion and then we get Joe Pesci's performance which is absolutely iconic, however in this movie, Joe isn't the short-tempered one, Bob is. Constantly thinking that his wife is thinking of another man in bed while they're making out and thinks that there is something going on between her and his brother (spoiler alert, there is no chemistry). The score composed by Pietro Mascagni is absolutely iconic, it is something dreams are made of, the cinematography is absolutely damn amazing and I couldn't expect anything more perfect or flawless from a movie.

The Dark Knight Rises," The Most Underrated Overrated Superhero Movie!
","Let me just start this review off by saying, it is one of the best films of the decade and (personally) one of the greatest and most well-made films ever made! When it came out it was revered, people were raving about it saying it was one of the greatest prequels ever created, there were a small amount of negative reviews, most saying it was still a fun journey and that Bane's voice was annoying and hard to hear (which I disagree with) I wouldn't want to get into the 'comparison game' as I believe that is nonsensical and you can't compare this with Nolan's Dark Knight because they are both two completely different movies with different subject matter, but if it came to comparing this and Batman Begin, I much rather prefer this as it has a much more in depth and villainous story.Christopher Nolan is easily one of the greatest director working today (Martin Scorsese still the Great), no doubt in my mind. He is yet to make a bad, even average, film and every movie he makes is completely unique and visually stunning, Tom Hardy as Bane just meshes in so perfectly with the final product and... I'm gonna say it... Anne Hathaway is the best Catwoman, she has more of a background story to her than Michelle Pheiffer's Catwoman did and goes into much more detail of what her and Bruce Wayne's relationship was like. When I watch it, I don't know which character I should feel more sympathetic for... Bruce Wayne or Bane because both of them have tremendously heartbreaking back-stories and great character development.Batman's costume design is absolutely fresh and stunning, just like Catwoman's and Bane's. The final fight between Bane and Batman is intense and beautifully shot, it is exactly what I expect from a great director, when I first watched this, I wanted to watch it immediately after I had just watched it. It is just one of those movies where I can cease to find any big problems with it, I watched this movie so closely and intensely trying to find a fault in this movie and I have to admit... I can't.

Casino," Not A Mob Movie
","One thing I must warn you before going into this picture is that it is not a gangster picture, it is about the life of a man called Frank Rosenthal (Sam Rothstein) who is basically the owner of the casino. This film explores the life of running a casino and Joe Pesci steals the show every scene he is in, even if De Niro is the better actor.Let me just start off my review by saying that if you go into this movie EXPECTING a 'gangster' movie, you will be terribly disappointed, this story isn't about the mob, it's about what it's like to be the manager if a casino whilst having a friend INVOLVED in the mob. Robert De Niro gives (possibly) the greatest performance of the 90's, his character is so deeply interesting and his money-abusive wife Ginger Mckenna who has been with a pimp played by James Woods ever since she was 15. She asks for money and overuses it, De Niro decides to make her the only one accessible to his bank account and life savings.Joe Pesci's character, Nicky Santoro, is part of the mob, and he asks Sam Rothstein if he could come to Las Vegas, it isn't long before he gets in the papers, the news articles write that if Nicky is ever seen in a casino, he will be taken to court, 'Even if someone tripped over a ******* banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.' Eventually, they end up having an argument in the desert about Sam telling Andy Stone that Nicky was bringing a lot of heat on him, being visible in his casinos and being known for whacking people.The end result is that one of Nicky's best friends, Frank, ends up killing his brother, burying Nicky alive with wounds in his face from the strength of the bat. One of the greatest movies of the 1990's and one of Scorsese's greatest. Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Direction: 10/10 Costume Design: 10/10",10,0,0,28 April 2020
Deadpool," 'Let's count 'em down!'
","This movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic! I'd say this would be after Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises as one of my all time favourite action/comic book movies. It's possibly the most quotable film of the century, the best comedy of the century, literally everything about this movie is awesometacular.",10,0,0,20 June 2020
Gangs of New York," One Of My All Time Favourites!
","This movie goes for 2 hours and 50 minutes but you can hardly feel the length, Daniel Day Lewis' once again disappears into is role and it's quite frankly my favourite performance of all time. Martin Scorsese's direction and production is probably the best thing about the entire movie, he directs this film so well you couldn't tell the difference between what's real and what's not. The connection between Leo and Diaz is what I think makes the story a bit more interesting. No doubt, Scorsese should've won Best Director and Best Picture, it still pisses me off that he didn't win, but that's just proof how much credibility the Academy has.Now we are gonna get into spoiler territory, so if you haven't seen this movie, see it now!!! So, this tells the story of The Dead Rabbits vs Bowery Boys, which were two street gangs back in the 19th Century, Bowery Boys were an Anti-Irish and Anti-Catholic gang that basically just killed Irish, European-American and Catholic people, and their biggest target/enemy were the Dead Rabbits which consisted of Irish-American criminals and their leader was a strong and wealthy father of our lead character, Amsterdam. Bill the Butcher Cutting (William Poole) was jealous of Priest Vallon and ends up killing our main character's father.If I could write a more into detail review of his movie I would, but all I need to say about this movie has already been said, it's one of the best gang movies, the best Day-Lewis performance, one of the best Scorsese films of all time.

Goodfellas," 'As Far Back As I Remember I Always Wanted To Be A Gangster'
","One word: Flawless. This film devours the meaning of great acting and great direction and swallows it up, now Martin has directed a lot of flawless pictures, but this is honestly up to par with The Godfather as one of the best movies of all time, this movie is nothing but pure greatness and an example of what other movies should be but aren't. Martin Scorsese is directing an amazing picture but spitting in other director's faces in the process because nobody's better at this than he is, he said he would never return to the genre of crime drama or gangster films ever again. And jeez am I happy he did making gangster movies such as; Casino, Gangs of New York, The Departed and The Irishman. Film of the 1990's and deserves its' praise. SPOILERS FROM NOW ON: There is one scene (which I am obviously gonna spoil) where Jimmy thinks Tommy is being made, but Tom notices a bit too late he fell into a trap, the people who offered him this were friends of Billy (the guy he kills by shooting around three times and hides the body) they had just found out that he killed their friend, they shot him in the head. Now the opening line is possibly the most quotable line in film history, 'As far back as I remember I always wanted to be a gangster'. Not only does this line set you up for the entire theme of the movie, the narration in this film is possibly the most perfect narration ever put in film, we see Henry's perspective and his wife Karen's perspective, both points of view. Violence is like the main character in this movie and is the best performance, the film should have won a lot of Academy Awards and that's based on actual facts. Grade: A+",10,0,0,25 January 2020
