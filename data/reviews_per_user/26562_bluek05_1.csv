Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," this movie stinks from the beginning
",How many of above 7 rating voters will vote the same if instead Kazakhstan was Israel? This film is a shame and the people who high rated it are pathetically ignorant. I've read the main 'comment' on IMDb and this guy was talking about the social realities. My God! To be ignorant is one thing but to be arrogant is the greatest form of stupidity. Borat contains only fake assertions. The main high rate voters are teenagers. It is an age when you not think too much on a subject. But the be an adult and to laugh about 'the glorious nation of Kazakhstan'? Come on! I bet 90% of the people who high rated this film didn't know there is somewhere in the world a real country called Kazachstan. And if they did... this is worse. Anyway it is a pity because on a suitable subject the movie may be a good comedy.,1,32,63,21 January 2007
