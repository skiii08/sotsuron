","I was so excited for this to come out. I waited months and months, then finally it was here and I was sorely disappointed. Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite movies. 300 and Watchem were both awesome movies. This one was 'pretty', that's about all I can say. Like all of his other movies it was shot beautifully. The CGI was awesome and so was the action. The movie as a whole fell short. The story line was ridiculous. It was way to undeveloped. If they put a little more time in the story it could have been OK. The acting really wasn't anything special either. I like Carla Gugino in most movies, however in this one she just couldn't keep her accent and at times was pretty noticeable. The other girls weren't anything special either. They weren't terrible but it was all very one leveled for me. I love beautiful women with guns just as much as the next guy but for me this was huge let down. This was Zack Snyder's first he helped write the script ( I believe ), maybe he should just stick with what he's good at, simply directing. O and as for the ending quote at the end of the movie. RIDICULOUS.",4,3,9,4 April 2011
Insidious," Insidious is, Insidious is, Insidious is....Amazing
","A PG-13 that not only scared me but gave me hope for the horror movie genre. I love horror movies. I'll watch anything from slasher to monster. This one was like nothing I have ever seen. I don't want to give away spoilers i'm just letting you know whatever you think this movies gonna be about, it's not. Beautifully shot, good acting, good direction, great story, scared the crap out of me and had an ending I have been praying for since I started watching horror films when I was a kid. I'll be honest Paranormal activity scared me. There is some Paranormal activity moments in this movie that made me jump but that's not the whole point of the movie. Don't be thinking it is. Also its from the dude that directed the first saw. There is not blood and guts galore either, just a well thought out crazy awesome story that will have you leaving the theater feeling satisfied and ready to tell all of your friends and co workers to go out and see it.",10,9,18,4 April 2011
