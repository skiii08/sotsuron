Blade Runner 2049," It's almost perfect, almost...
","A very well done movie that lives up to its predecessor, but at the same time not afraid to differ from it. The visuals, the characters, the story are amazing and different from the original, keeping just enough of the story, the style and the characters so you could say it's a continuation and not a reboot or a spin-off. I have one little problem, maybe it's just me but at the end I felt like it could go on for another hour so we could see the replicant uprising, the fall of Wallace, and the full reconnect between Deckard and his daughter. I just didn't want it to end where it did. They better not wait another 35 years to make it into a trilogy.",10,3,12,5 October 2017
