Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An eyesore mixture of pop culture and utter lack of action makes this one inferior to Vol.1 in almost every way.
","Vol.1 was easily one of the best films of 2003, arguably the best Action film since 'The Crow', and quite easily, a Cult classic, rivalling the glory of 'Pulp Fiction'.Wielding her katana (lazily called the 'Samurai Sword' in Kill Bill), Beatrix Kiddo, AKA 'The Bride', set off on a quest for pure revenge, cutting down every man and woman in her way.In Vol.1 we saw extreme gore and ridiculously overdone beheadings (while they were still executed in a way we could all chuckle at), but then the wait was on for it's sequel.Kill Bill Vol. 2 was bashed down by a rapid flooding of reviews and beaten to the tooth by professional critics.I for one do not blame the complaints, as there is a complete absence of the action we all came to love in Vol. 1, and with such stars as Uma Thurman (who also starred in 'Pulp Fiction' and generally has a knack for playing in Tarantino's movies) and Michael Madsen, this movie was hyped up to the max.In this movie there is too much talking, with excessive pop culture type speech and carnage caused by sitting on one's fat arse (see Budd). But we do find SOME positivity. The pure fact that this is a disappointing sequel with an even more disappointing end doesn't shake the fact that if Uma Thurman weren't the lead character, this movie would be down there with such piles of cow dung as 'The Crow 2: City of Angels' or 'Half Past Dead', she is the only actress who can play the role perfectly, absolutely NO ONE could play The Bride any better. And thanks to her, she has just pulled Vol. 2 over the line as a must-see affair.My PERSONAL overall? 6/10. If someone else played The Bride, then it would be a definite 2/10.",Null,1,3,10 September 2004
Requiem for a Dream," It's a sad and haunting reflection on society gone amok.
","It's not every day that a film challenges not only the emotions and standpoints of absolutely every individual who views it, but the censorships and guidelines of so many governments.With an unhealthy record of recutting and revamping that has left Darren Aronofsky more insane than he was before he went into making the film, and an Academy Award winner headlining, Requiem For A Dream has had its share of ups and downs, raking in little at the box office due to its initial NC-17 classification, and yet has come out on top with an immense cult following.RFAD tells the tale of four individuals being torn apart by their drug addictions, in what is a depressing downward spiral seeing the dreams of all involved ruined by their senseless addictions.In all honesty, I have never seen a film that made me break down until I had seen this one. The final montage of the climactic moments left me haunted by the results, and in the moments that followed after the credits rolled, I wasn't able to hold myself together. It's not hard to see why if you actually watch the film, and while many would be so modest and 'cool' to say they never cried, it'll affect everyone, and you'd be a god damn junkie yourself not to be affected in one way or another.I think they should cut the Classification for society's sake and show it to all who know the meaning of what goes on in this film, because it's movies like this that have the ability to change the messed up world we live in.And as a side note, Ellen Burstyn deserved that damn Oscar, hell, she gave the greatest female performance I've ever seen in my life.",10,1,2,12 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A unique look at the series but quite flawed...
","Enter Star Wars.Beginning of the most successful Science Fiction epic of all time.Brilliant in so many ways.Enter Empire Strikes Back.Consumes the first with immense professionalism and a brilliant final sequence.Enter Return of the Jedi.A dark take at the emotions of Luke and a finale that leaves you breathless.Now comes The Phantom Menace...It starts off, 'whodathunkit' in space. With a ship approaching the Trade Federation ship that is blocking off all entry into Naboo. The first person to speak is an unnamed (irrelevant character altogether) female captain with an unnecessarily high (and very annoying) voice who thankfully DIES ten minutes later, then we get a glimpse of the shady Viceroy, a 'lazy' villain who starts off the long string of ethnic mockery with his horribly obvious Japanese accent.This is a movie that had so much potential, the cast was brilliant (save for Jake Lloyd...); the animation was up to date; and you know the story just clicks with the original trilogy the moment you hear the name 'Obi-Wan' leave Qui Gon Jinn's (Liam Neeson, Schindler's List) mouth and you see him standing there, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting) in all his youth.But what it really has not got going for it was the horrible actor playing Anakin; the intensely frequent, blatant and aggravating ethnic accent mockery; and the Gungans... yes, the latter alone was a catastrophe, easily the stupidest things created by Mr. Lucas and to make Jar Jar Binks sound like a Jamaican- wannabe has just crossed the line...The dialogue is pretty horrible too, 'Roger-roger'; 'They'll squash us, cut us into tiny little pieces, and then blast us into oblivion!'; and the ever annoying 'Mesa Gungan!'.However these can be overlooked by some (not by many...) with its spectacular Pod Race scene, which takes up a good slice of the movie; and the brilliant lightsaber finale, which seemed to have sparked up a short-lasting craze for the Double-Edged Lightsaber in which you see the main villain Darth Maul (Ray Park) wield in the fight scene where sparks fly and a unique obstruction twist leads to ultra drama.I certainly enjoyed it, I can't guarantee you will, though if you can look past the flaws, move on to the slightly less flawed Episode II and get your blood pumping for Episode III, then you'll love the Star Wars series more than you did before.",7,1,1,9 April 2005
The English Patient," The Best Of All Best Picture Winners For Reasons Hidden In Their Poetic Triumphs...
","In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that 'the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness...' A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany.The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. Usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.Many will criticize this film based on its so called 'glorification of adulterers', but those who do know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of Almásy in a way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job.So please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it 'boring' or 'despicable' know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.",10,3,6,23 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The magic of the originals has indeed returned...
","I was very excited to see this movie... it was easily the most advertised thing on television and those who had done reviews on it in the newspapers were strongly convinced. Not one single negative.I was excited, Episodes I and II were both a great disappointment, and even with my excitement, I still had a sickening feeling that Hayden Christensen was going to screw it up again, just like he did Episode II (though you could blame it on George Lucas, as it was him who made Hayden act in that annoying 'angsty rawr rawr' manner) With this installment, the saga has been completed, and the dreams of every 'Star Wars nerd' has come true. I don't call myself obsessed, I am merely interested in the story, it is all extraordinarily attractive, it contains life values of most basic or most important stature. Most importantly, it is the greatest journey one can take in the Star Wars universe.The opening credits were a great welcome, and despite my lack of knowledge on the cartoon series 'Clone Wars', I knew what to expect, I had an idea on what had happened, and most importantly, I actually knew who the hell this 'Grievous' was, unlike the majority of the viewers in the fellow audience.Without giving too much away, we all know what this movie is about. It's about the betrayal of a great power, the seduction of a once kindhearted man to the side of wrongdoings. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader.But it was HOW Lucas was going to execute the occurrences into something interesting and watchable. Episode I left so much to do, and Episode II barely executed any of the things left to weave into Episode IV, but Episode III has managed to do all of these things without becoming rushed and confused. And interestingly, the cheesy dialogue people have come to hate remains, but I feel it is a necessary addition to keep the Star Wars saga true to the 1977 original.I have little to no gripes, Jar Jar Binks, though he provided comic relief for myself, was definitely far too annoying and heavily unnecessary to the flow of the story, and thankfully, he doesn't speak one line in this whole movie, hell, you see him in two scenes and only in the background.Most actors I expected bigger roles out of have been reduced to mere cameo-esquire appearances (Whale Rider's Keisha Castle Hughes is glimpsed for a mere three seconds as the Queen of Naboo and Grand Moff Tarkin appears for no longer than 10 seconds before he strays suspiciously off frame), but this fails to bother me, as it doesn't affect the flow of the story, nor does it ruin anything.Episode III is that long awaited bridge from the despised world of the prequels into the legendary world of the original trilogy. Though still set twenty-odd years before Episode IV, it is, in many ways, a direct prequel, and ALL unanswered questions that have plagued our dreams for nearly 30 years have finally been answered.If you have not yet seen it, do so, NOW.",10,5,10,20 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Arguably one of the greatest movies of all time and an absolute classic.
","Superb acting and brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), who play as inmates, Tim Robbins playing a man framed for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. The two inmates develop a friendship over the twenty odd years spent in the prison.This movie portrays an ugly, though bearable life in prison through the 40s, 50s, and 60s.It's a strong piece on how far one will go to redeem himself, even if those things that must be redeemed are not by any means loathsome. See it if you haven't.",8,0,1,25 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I'm sorry, since when was this the third best film of all time?
","It's an okay film, epic and all, of course, the fact that it's an epic like Gladiator or Troy doesn't mean it's good, Troy proved that fact, and Alexander continued to prove it with one star antics.To be quite frank, Peter Jackson is an overrated director, much like the Lord of the Rings movies are overrated movies. If you notice, all three are located in the top fifteen films, this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as Seven Samurai; Schindler's List; and even Casablanca! This is not the case...With camera angles that make you sick, utilising the, admittedly beautiful landscape of New Zealand, to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of Middle Earth. But wait! Where are the interesting characters? Every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up, you seem to hope that they'd be dead by the second one, but no, they come along to the third one to kick some Sauron ass.Here's my view of Lord of the Rings: A whole load of walking.Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring: *points* There! *walks* Lord of the Rings- The Two Towers: *points* There! *walks, trips up, walks on* Lord of the Rings- Return of the King: *points* There! *walks, throws ring into mountain, walks away*Take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie (depending on which one you watch, and I myself wouldn't touch the Extended versions...), you really get the idea that the Academy Awards truly are flawed. Why look! Forrest Gump won best film of 1994 instead of The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction! Titanic won best film of 1997 instead of L.A. Confidential! And, why, lookey here! LOTR- ROTK won best ****ing film of 2003 instead of Mystic River...Perhaps next year we'll have The Constant Gardener as the best film of 2005, that may actually redeem the Oscars' failing reputation, a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half-arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as 'Best Film'.",1,6,30,2 September 2005
