The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A beautiful film about growing and loving while struggling to be a teenager
","Charlie is an introvert teen trying to manoeuvre his way through his freshman year of high school. But it's difficult when you have no friends, you're dealing with recent tragedy in your life, and you've withdrawn into yourself. He's a prime target for bullying.But then he meets Patrick and Sam, two quirky older teens who are inseparable. And full of life. Oh so full of life. They take Charlie under their wing and show him what it means to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved. 'Welcome to the island of misfit toys,' Sam whispers to Charlie. For the first time in a long time, Charlie feels like he belongs and that he is surrounded by people who understand. And he starts to blossom and emerge from his cocoon.But Charlie is still dealing with his own demons and recurring bouts of mental illness. His friends are the only things keeping him together. And when an incident temporarily tears them apart, he finds himself falling back into his emotional abyss.But Charlie isn't the only one who has pain. Both Patrick and Sam have experienced their own troubles and each deals with them in a different way. Sam is thoughtful and tender but her low self-esteem leads her to accept less than she deserves from her suitors. Patrick sheaths his own internal turmoil with showy bravado in the form of an extrovert. This was the most beautiful teen movie I've ever watched and tears emerged several times while watching it. I could feel the pain of the characters as I learned each of their secrets and realized that they were all just trying to make it through those torturous teen years without going crazy. The level of depth of each of these characters has hardly been matched in any other film I've seen.I fell in love with Charlie, Sam and Patrick and was truly heartbroken to say goodbye to them as the credits began to roll. But I knew they had each other and that they had formed a lifelong bond that would see them through what would undoubtedly be more tough times ahead.The three main actors in the movie are mind-blowingly good. Emma Watson does a great job breaking out of the Hermoine Granger pigeon hole as Sam. Logan Lerman is wonderful as Charlie: awkward, shy, uncertain, and sensitive. He wants to fit in but he doesn't quite know how. He needs to find friends that fit him. But Ezra Miller! Wow! This is the second ground-breaking performance I've seen him in. Following up a positively mesmerizing performance in 'We Need to Talk About Kevin', Miller oozes flamboyance, charm and wit as Patrick. Others who round out an outstanding supporting cast include Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermott.I rate this movie 9/10. It's a beautiful and touching glimpse into the lives of three incredible teenagers. I will hold fond memories of them all for a long time.",9,0,1,22 March 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Casey Affleck is the New 'One to Watch'
","I went to see Gone Baby Gone desperately hoping for a taut thriller that wouldn't insult my intelligence and would hold my attention. Boy, I wasn't disappointed! I haven't been able to stop thinking about the movie since I saw it. Casey Affleck was just simply mesmerizing. I couldn't take my eyes off him. What a great actor he has developed into. I knew him from the Ocean's movies and from Gerry. I've heard he's brilliant in Jesse James, but now I've witnessed it for myself. He is the new one to watch of his generation. His performance was so nuanced, but so captivating. Every emotion played on his face and Ben gave him lots of close-ups so we could feel it. I completely believed in his character. I was also extremely impressed with Ben's directing abilities. Wow, he has really developed into a more-than-competent film director. Some scenes were so effective and held me in a trance. The scene where Patrick joins the cops in the raid on the house was beautiful, when the scene went silent and time stood still for those very long seconds. You felt every heartbeat in Patrick's chest. The cinematography was beautiful...such gorgeous and luscious shots of those downtrodden neighbourhoods. All the performances were first-rate; however, I do have to agree with some reviewers that Morgan Freeman seemed to be out of place. He is just too big for the small role that was bestowed upon him. Although I love Mr. Freeman, I think a lesser-known actor would have been more effective. Amy Ryan was spot-on as Helene. A brave performance with no hesitation to reveal every flaw and no clich√©d attempts to redeem this pitiful woman. People don't change. I could go on and on. But all I want to do is say, go see this movie. You will be hard pressed to see a better one this year. Leonardo who?? Casey Affleck is the young actor you want to star in your next movie.",10,5,11,20 October 2007
