Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My favorite film of the 'Prequel Trilogy,' which holds sentimental value
","I realize that it may not have been everybody's favorite 'Star Wars' film, but it is one of my favorites (along with 'the Empire Strikes Back')! The visual and sound effects in the film weren't bad at all, plus Liam Neeson is excellent as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. Also unlike most 'Star Wars' fans, I actually kind of liked Jar Jar. Sure Jar Jar may be a bit too silly at times, but he still made my father and I laugh.
As a child, I remember dressing up on Hallowwen of 1999 as Queen Amidala (long before I knew anything about 'Star Wars'). The costume design in this film (especially the Queen's) was very exquisite as well, and I think that it's a real shame that Trisha Bigar wasn't even Oscar-Nominated for her designs! I remember when this film's merchandise was all the rage when I was in the first grade.
Last but not least, Jake Lloyd's acting really wasn't that bad in this film, considering that he was only 9 at the time, and he certainly did not deserve all of the harsh critical backlash from those of the 'Star Wars' fanbase.",8,2,5,25 May 2019
