Black Swan," Black Swan; Brilliant Film
","One of the best films I've seen in a very long time. Black Swan is one of those movies that stays with you and haunts your thoughts days after watching. The plot was amazing and unique to other movies that have come out this year; it's very refreshing to see a different story. Natalie Portman was spectacular. She made the audience believe entirely in her character's obscure, mental transition. I don't think any other actress could have played the part more perfectly.This film brought an element of fear not often explored in modern films; psychological fear. It keeps you guessing until the very end. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone wanting to view a intellectually stimulating film.",10,9,18,19 December 2010
