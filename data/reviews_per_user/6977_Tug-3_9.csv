The Blair Witch Project," It hit me where it hurts! (Warning: some possible spoilers)
","It is difficult for me to give an objective review of this film.  It is the most terrifying movie _I_ have ever seen, but my appraisal is, in this case, very subjective.  I was raised in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, where Jersey Devil lore still runs rampant and where, as recently as five years ago, a city-slicker couple got lost only ten miles away from the nearest paved road and starved to death.  I have always considered the woods to be sinister, and _Blair Witch_ might be the fulmination of all my unspoken fears.  It's pompous to say that whether or not you think this film is effective is dependent on how much imagination you have.  It is more accurate to say that your enjoyment of the movie is based on what sorts of fears you already have.I am fairly certain that at some point, one of the filmmakers must have seen a low-budget 1984 movie called 'The Wind That Walks,' which used to air every Halloween on the NJ PBS station.  Many elements of the movie seem borrowed from this short film about a scientist who mistakenly kills the Jersey Devil's offspring, including a reliance on sound effects to convey the unseen menace, jerky camera work, and even the same low-tech font in the credits.  All of my childhood friends were scared to death of this film -- another reason why _Blair Witch_ got to me at such a visceral level.One recommendation.  As much as I liked this film, and as much as I want to see it succeed commercially, I must advise you to wait until it hits video stores.  Seeing this film in a theater is a bad idea, not because you might need a dramamine to get you through the more jerky scenes, but because any shuffling or coughing around you seriously detracts from its intensity.  You must play along with this movie: don't watch it guessing what horror cliche will show up next, but watch it as if you have uncovered some weird video that you are not supposed to see.  Think of it as an illicit snuff film, and you will be terrified.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An exhilarating beginning
","This movie just kicks bantha ass.  The space battle sequences are dizzying; the pod race sequence is exhilarating (and so much fun -- watch for familiar Tatooinians popping up along the way!); and the lightsaber battle at the end is SO good, so fierce and fast-paced, and so fulfilling.  It is a funny, goodhearted movie, one that doesn't mind rooting for the good guys and cheering when they win.  The touches of the 'Dark Side' are subtle -- the last speaking sequence of the movie, with Yoda speculating about the existence of other Sith lords, gives us the slightest shudder of apprehension, and makes us just the slightest bit upset that there are three years until the next installment.Many critics have decided to jump on the 'no character development' bandwagon.  Trust me: ignore this.  What do these critics mean by 'character development'?  How much more do we need?  Anyone who goes into the movie with the slightest knowledge of what _Star Wars_ is all about knows who these characters are and where they come from.  I don't read _Morte Darthur_ asking 'Where did this character's motivation come from?'  We know plenty about these characters, these representatives of good and evil, of dignity and recklessness, of strength and vengeance.  We hiss Darth Maul, the most vile and violent malfeasor in the series (he doesn't do a Vader 180 turn!). We cheer for Anakin, even if it bothers us that he says 'Yippee!', because we feel his innocence and his desire to succeed.  These characters are so developed we know them before we even meet them; they are already part of our familiar world. I loved this movie.  I loved every minute of it, every dot of it, every sound (with the exception of the Neimoidian's Charlie-Channish voices), every laser blast and droid beep.   I haven't ever had as much fun at a movie, and I have never left the theater feeling so content.  I entered the theater trying to clear my mind of worldly concerns, and trying to experience this new installment with the mind of a child; but I quickly realized that this was not necessary.  The movie makes no demands on your consciousness.  Go see it.  Let yourself smile as you experience this new but familiar galaxy.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
Batman Returns," I ashamedly admit: my favorite movie
","Whenever anyone asks me my favorite movie, I cringe and say 'Actually, it's *Batman Returns*.'  Then I cover my ears when they yell out 'What?  Are you crazy?' Actually, it's a fair question.  This film is really an acquired taste, and yes, it does have its flaws.  For one thing, of course, it's not at all true to the comic book: Batman kills, Catwoman is not a thief, the Penguin is not an aristocratic mastermind.  For another thing, the acting borders on awful, from Michelle Pfeiffer's irritating 'I'm-so-lonesome' schtick at the beginning, to Danny DeVito's thoroughly repulsive histrionics. But this film somehow transcends these picayune concerns and becomes a dark, almost poetic masterpiece.  Tim Burton fills the screen with haunting, daring, and nightmarish images, that capture the essence of the Dark Knight, if not the details.  If you're a Tim Burton fan (which I most assuredly am), you should know that this is probably the most Tim Burtonesque film he has yet made.   I dunno...guess I can't really put it into words...I am a longtime Batman fanatic, and for me this movie captures all the darkness, fierceness, and tragedy that surround the legend of the Dark Knight.  It IS worth renting.",10,2,4,28 October 1998
Midnight in Paris," This movie includes Gertrude Stein; therefore, it MUST be good!
","While I'm sure some moviegoers did find this film enchanting, I think the greater majority of critics and viewers who claim it's a masterpiece are just afraid to admit that a film that name-drops so many intellectuals is just not very good. For a film whose list of characters includes some of the greatest minds of the early twentieth century, 'Midnight in Paris' has little to say about the creative process or inspiration.Maybe I've just gotten sick of Woody Allen's gimmick. Every film he makes includes the same list of players: the shrill wife / girlfriend, the overbearing other man / father, the nebbishy Allen stand-in (played this time by Owen Wilson, who makes a valiant, stuttering effort but is far too likable and easygoing a screen presence to really come off as neurotic and quirky), the ravishing young girl who finds the nebbish irresistible. And every film he makes includes terrific actors reciting their lines as if they're at the script's first table read.Possible spoiler territory: Allen starts the film with a five-minute travelogue of nice places to visit in Paris, then introduces us to characters we'd never be able to stomach in real life. They have affairs and spend $18,000 on chairs and attend wine-drinking parties. We meet Gil and his fiancée, whose engagement is a complete mystery, and the fiancée's father, who must be evil because he's Republican. After watching these people amble around Paris for a while, we join Gil as he journeys back in time somehow to meet the artists he claims as personal heroes.Many episodes of 'Doctor Who' deal with time travel better than this film does. I'm not saying this to score a cheap point: The Vincent van Gogh episode from season 5, for example, introduces us to a world-famous artist as a brilliant but troubled thinker who has passion and ideas he struggles to express, and whose work in turn is shown inspiring those in the future.Not so here. Gil seems to take no inspiration whatsoever from this amazing blessing, responding to his ability to travel through time with what can only be described as nonchalance. He encounters Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Stein, and other writers we all read in college. Here's where I began to find the name-dropping irritating. These are CliffNotes versions of these great thinkers. Hemingway is brash. Zelda Fitzgerald is loony. Gertrude Stein is heavyset. We get it. What does this movie have to say about their work, their influence, their passion? What draws them together and makes their work vital? Certainly we don't find out by watching Gil. At first, he's kinda happy to show Stein his novel, but then once he meets Marion Cotillard as a Lost Generation groupie, he shifts his ambition to sleeping with Marion Cotillard. I can't blame him, but I have no idea what the movie's statement becomes at this point. Something involving nostalgia, but even Gil admits that it's not a very compelling epiphany. Big spoiler: This amazing time-traveling adventure of self-discovery ends up not with Gil reinvigorated and pursuing his dream, but deciding to hang around in Paris because it's pretty in the rain, and meeting a nice hot young girl who likes Paris because it's pretty in the rain. What I'm trying to say is: Shallow movie.To its credit, this movie did make me question, at about the 75th verse of 'Let's Fall in Love,' why Hemingway didn't punch Cole Porter in the jaw.",3,89,141,8 October 2011
Once," The rarest sort of film
","The storyline of 'Once' is simple and the direction is spare, but the characters are complex and compelling. And most important, they remain true to their dreams and to themselves.The movie is full of touching moments, but it never becomes shallow or cloying, because the leads are so genuine in their emotion and in their friendship.I respect the film's ending. It wasn't the outcome I expected, but it was the outcome that made sense.'Once' is the rarest sort of film: a movie about thoughtful, creative adults who inspire and respect one another, and who value art and music.",10,3,5,22 February 2008
Dark City," Ominous, involving, and deep
","*Dark City* is thrilling, dark, relentless, terrifying, stimulating.  It is one of the most involving science fiction films I have ever seen.  It borrows liberally from other sources, yes; but it combines these plundered elements into an original story that is surprising and frightening.Many folks have compared this far superior film to another very good science fiction movie, *The Matrix.*  Both movies share the same paranoid vision of a reality controlled by an outside, and possibly malevolent, force.  But whereas *The Matrix* uses the concrete reality we know and love as a reference point, *Dark City* gives us no such boundary.  Others have commented that the end of *Dark City* is unfulfilling, and they are right. But there is a reason *why* the end is unfulfilling: Proyas asks us questions about the nature of reality that are much too difficult to answer in the span of 2 hours.  This film asks questions about the malleability of humankind, the resonance of dreams, the power of the will, and the need for evolution.  These are philosophical questions it cannot answer, and wisely it does not try.The 'showdown' at the climax of the film is not representative of a lack of creativity, as it is in so many other films.  We are almost fooled into thinking that conquering the Strangers will provide John with the key to solving his problems, but it does not.  We are left with the same nagging questions after the smoke has cleared from the highly-charged, brilliantly-conceived showdown: does reality exist?  Who dictates what form of reality we must embrace?  Will life improve now that the Strangers have been obliterated?*Dark City* is a film that forces us (or forced me, at least) to confront the terrible fear that life is but a nightmare.",9,0,1,30 April 1999
Man on the Moon," An unsatisfying biopic
","As a die-hard fan of Andy Kaufman, I am upset to be so disappointed with his long-awaited film biography.  While _Man on the Moon_ is a well-made film, it presents a portrait of the comedian that simply does not ring true.  I understand that Kaufman was a complex individual whose life cannot be summed up in a satisfying package.  But this movie leaves out the one important aspect of Kaufman's multiple personalities that made him bearable and entertaining: his innate sweetness.Jim Carrey does a good job of aping Kaufman's mannerisms, and he does manage to create a three-dimensional, interesting character.  However, his performance is too brutish, too physically intimidating, to really capture what made Kaufman appealing.  Carrey's Kaufman is a complete pain and everyone around him knows it.  The film makes no attempt to explain why George Shapiro promoted the renegade comedian so relentlessly; why Bob Zmuda put up with his bullying; why his parents and his girlfriend weathered the cruelty of his gags; why the entire cast of 'Taxi' admired him despite his prima donna status and his self-centered shenanigans; or why anyone would make a movie honoring such a mean-spirited individual.Whether or not Kaufman was 'nice' is a subject for endless debate.  In interviews concerning Kaufman, his onetime colleagues almost unanimously discuss his good-natured sweetness, his generosity, and his boundless creativity.  It seems incongruous that the selfish star Carrey portrays would inspire such adulation.  At the same time, the movie soft-pedals Kaufman's more irritating moments as well.  When he reads the entire _Great Gatsby_ to his audience, Forman underscores the scene with an orchestral adaptation of the movie's theme song, as if to say 'What a misunderstood genius!,' giving the scene an elegiac quality that is completely misplaced.  Even when Kaufman's acts fail, we are made to feel that audiences were wrong to walk out on him.  As a result, the movie is tremendously unsatisfying.  We are left with no idea why anyone would ever find Kaufman appealing.  As a Kaufman fan, I could at last admire the last moments of the picture for their touching portrayal of Kaufman's battle with cancer.  But I am dismayed to think that for many audience members Carrey's portrayal will be the closest they come to experiencing Andy Kaufman's comic talents.",Null,0,0,10 January 2000
The Waterboy," I hate to admit it: it's not all that bad.
","The trailer for 'The Phantom Menace' premiered last night at special showings of the *The Waterboy* and *Meet Joe Black,* and since I could never again refer to myself as a man if I went to see the latter, I swallowed my pride and opted for the former.  Maybe it was the awesome trailer for what will surely be the finest movie since . . . well, since *Return of the Jedi*--that inclined me to be in a mood of pure excitement, but for some reason I actually enjoyed this harmless little movie.  It's one of the few brainless comedies I've seen which doesn't rely on jokes about bodily functions to pull it through.  Granted, Adam Sandler is awfully irritating, but there are enough other charming characters--especially the underrated Henry Winkler as the Coach--to carry the film along.  Of course we all know what's coming at the end, but this film is, after all, a parody, and it pokes fun at feel-good sports movies with a much sharper focus than last summer's 'Baseketball.'  There are also some sublimely hilarious moments, especially with the incomprehensible assistant coach, and Rob Schneider's full-down-funny cameo.  Now my pride is completely digested!",Null,0,1,18 November 1998
Casino," It made me kind of sick.
","I can usually understand varying points of view on a film.  I know that there are some people who actually enoy movies like *The Mighty Ducks* and *Gordy,* and I can accept that.  But *Casino* confuses me to no end.  I simply can't understand why anybody would want to watch such a violent, unpleasant, irritating movie.  I'm a pretty liberal guy, and I've seen plenty of ultra-violent films, but this is the only one that left me really unsettled with its complete reliance on brutality as a plot device.  I don't want to see people getting hit with baseball bats for five minutes--do you? If so, please seek help and stay the hell away from me.  Also, the acclaim given to Sharon Stone mystifies me.  People--really--feel free to admit that she's not a good actress.  She wasn't good in *King Solomon's Mines,* she wasn't good in *Basic Instinct,* and she's melodramatic and unconvincing in this worthless film.",Null,0,1,22 November 1998
