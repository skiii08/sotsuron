Saturday Night Fever," Enjoyment, flair and kick ass dancing all on Saturday Night
","There have not been many dance films since it's arrival and certainly none to beat.But don't forget this film isn't all about the dancing and polyester suits or platform shoes, it does have a descent story added to it's power are the classic Bee Gees songs like Night Fever, Stayin Alive and others. Despite not being born in the 70's, i can still picture the elements that made the 70's so memorable as it has with Saturday Night Fever thirty years after its release. You really have to watch this film about twice to really get the story and characters.The only perspective that could have been improved was MORE DANCING! It just didn't have enough, but the elements it did contain were beautifully stunning with John Travolta taking the lead and no doubt 'King' of the dance floor. By all means see this for a class piece of cinema masterpiece.",7,0,1,5 October 2007
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not bad
",".......But could have been better. National Treasure Book of Secrets is an average action adventure film starring Nic Cage. Yes it is trying (but not succeeding) to be and feel like an Indiana Jones films. Sure the adventure aspects there but thats all when compared to the classics. Yes Nic Cage is off again in search for the book of secrets. An historic book only viewed by the Presidants of the United States. But when Ben Gates's (Cage) great great grandfathers name appears as one of the assassins who killed Abraham Lincoln. Determined to prove his ancestors innocence Ben and his followers embark on a quest to find the book of secrets.With it's mediocre story and some half created characters Book of Secret tries but lacks in depth and fullness of a good film. Cage eagerly plays his character but at times slips up into some boredom and irrelevance, especially humour.",6,0,0,26 September 2008
Walk the Line," A Masterpiece
","Walk the Line isn't another one of those ordinary films, its a masterpiece of epic proportions. From it's unforgettable screenplay to its majestic and searing acting, every level is raised to its highest. James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma) delivers his all, and quite certainly is his best. The stylish camera shots and motions all add tension to the films story and give real importance to the emotions of the main characters. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash and there's no reason to question it either. He wears the role as if he were Johnny Cash, and conquers it throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix is pure dynamite as Johnny Cash; the acting, the rhythmic style and of coarse the voice of a legend. Phoenix whilst also portraying Cash endeavours his own voice that to me sounds better than the real life Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon who won a Oscar for her bold portrayal as Cashe's love interest June Carter certainly doesn't let up. Her voice and soul of the character makes her more believable and intriguing for audiences to watch and definitely should highly be praised for winning the Oscar.Walk the Line is a fine masterpiece and best film of the year. The performances are electric and phenomenal as is the direction of a working genius.",10,1,1,30 August 2008
The Incredible Hulk," As near the same pathetic and stupid as the first
","*****Classic ****Excellant ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:The Incredible Hulk as already noticed is a reboot of the definite lesser than half good Ang Lee version which was released in 2003. But the question is, is the reboot better?As with the 2003 film, it was a grand disappointment and it mostly came down to the lack of good CGI, a sore and painful trodding story and Eric Bana not in his best role. Of coarse, 5 years on and a reboot of the franchise has been created, but audiences patiently await to know from other critics if the re start is any good. I gratefully say no. Compared to its other upstanding and highly plausible superhero's of 2008, The Incredible Hulk stands firmly in a gauge of green glue.The direction is all over the place, and shows no real sign of upgrading or improving. Some shots are nice but on the whole it's a poorly conceived and failed compromise to what could have been.The acting is not up to standards for Norton and Tyler. There presence when confronting each other is bloated and feels like they have nothing to say.Verdict:A failed and lacking film that doesn't deliver the goods of a solid superhero film as did Iron Man or The Dark Knight.*Tragic",2,2,6,29 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Adrenaline rushing through my veins!
","M:I:3 is quite simply a perfect summer blockbuster that audiences would be keen to watch again and again. Thats how exciting this film is. It contains all the elements and proportions of a superb action film. Take for example the direction, which is quite mesmerising to see a director like J.J. Abrams (Lost, Alias) take on such an important film that could have easily made or break the franchise. But fortunately Abrams puts care and detail into Mission Impossible 3, that ultimately ends with a reinvented film that blows M:I and M:I:2 out of the water.The cast which includes Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q all excel in their roles, which particularly makes this film worth watching even without all the action.M:I:3 IS a perfect example of a summer blockbuster and as a really great film directed by a director in top form.",10,0,1,30 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," more room fore improvement
","Not going against the other Str Wars films or anything, but this is simply the worst one out of the all. Okay, the only thing that was good about it was the lightsaber fight at the end, but that was about it.The characters could of been developed a bit more especially from Darth Maul and Padme. It just didn't satisfy me in a way that all the other ones did. It started to drag of towards the middle a bit, this is mainly because simply there was not enough action or story. About the only believable character within the story was C 3pio and Artoo Di 2. But this is nothing special, nothing exciting and nothing breath taking as of the old films.",1,3,6,20 March 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Stupendous, exciting and brilliant.
","This is pure hair-raising emotional film making and i haven't put a doubt about James Mangold directing any film since Walk the Line. 3:10 To Yuma lives up to Walk the Line and i couldn't have been more moved or thrilled by this epic western remake. The two most outstanding actors throughout the film were Russell Crowe and Ben Foster. My reasons are, that they both firstly were the best choice for the two roles they portray and their acting is inconceivably fantastic. The action is very realistic and brutal. It's also nice to see a descent western brought to the big screen and pulling of in such great flair. It does not dwell on any previous westerns instead 3:10 To Yuma is fresh from the fridge.The music add's a lot of context and layers the overall film with a thumping soundtrack, that reminds me of the The Good the Bad and the Ugly. PLease let there be more westerns, especially from James Mangold who, once again proves he is the best at great dramatised, emotional, action packed and brilliant film's.",10,1,5,16 September 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Your quintessential adventure movie
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is very possibly the best example of an action adventure film. It amounts great acting, unforgettable action and perfect storytelling all into one film. Every scene, every quotable dialogue is en-thrilling and exciting to watch. And then there's the infamous 'Raiders March' which John Williams has elegantly composed.As for the director, Steven Spielburg who is (in my opinion) the best director ever has created a movie so rich in detail and so unforgettably brilliant that films like these are the ones that will be treasured forever.",10,0,1,30 July 2008
Training Day," Denzel and Hawke= POWERFUL FILM
","A very descent crime, cop thriller, and a shocking ending to surprise people. Washington portray's Alonzo, a rogue cop and up for assassination by the Russian's. Hawke is a new narcotic's detective and on his first day. Bold and catchy, the couple pair up to make an unlikely couple throughout the film. One of them being bad, dangerous and single minded. The other being serious ans sensible, BUT are both day to day cop's.Addressed and directed by Antione Fugue (King Arthur) the film is good and hard hitting and to never trust anyone. Denzal Washington won a best actor award for the film. The 18 certificate, could and could not be displayed as an 18, for it to be an 18 it contain's pervasive language and not to mention strong drug content. BUT were the mistake come's in of not being an 18, is the fact it contains SOME strong violence, which doesn't occur to me. Anyway, still enjoy yourself and have a good time, but don't exit the cinema thinking this was the best film u'd ever seen.",6,0,3,19 August 2007
In Bruges," Farrells back on form
","After the dismal flop of Alexander, Collin Farrell has fallen sharp on his acting and presence in good films. In Bruges IS Farrells film. Delivering high octane and sharp witted acting Farrell continues to pursue greatness and will hopefully participate in other great films in the future. Although In Bruges is certainly Farrells film, he couldn't have managed without the brilliance of his side-kick Brendon Gleeson and director Martin McDonagh. Despite some minor flaws, In Bruges is a great example of a black comedy. Sharp acting, comedy as dark as the nights sky, beautiful cinematography and an Oscar winning director at the helm.What more could you want?",8,3,6,19 August 2008
Fight Club," One of, if not the greatest film ever made.
","Seriously, who would disagree with that comment- one of if not the best film ever made. All round applause must be given when finished watching the film. I, personally was hooked all the way through the film, endless positive thoughts scattering through the brain. This to me is Brad Pitt's greatest performance to date along with the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Edward Norton was also supremely superb all throughout. The direction is simply mind-bobbling from David Fincher, who has also directed some other critically acclaimed masterpieces such as Sev7n and Zodiac. Fincher here stays cool and cooperative to the cast and by the end of the film you feel that surely Fight Club is the best film ever made.",10,0,2,22 April 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Basically it's Tarantino's worst film!
","Inglourious Basterds IS Tarantino's worst film he has ever made. It's full of his usual ingredient's i.e. snappy dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but it all feel's deja-vu. The directing is typical Tarantino and nothing seem's new at all. It's almost as if he's copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. There is nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that isn't funny, nor brilliant as Pulp Fiction was. Basterds supposedly is Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti western's but seem's mis-jointed and out of place especially with the continuing use of big sub-titles and throw's the audience of balance.",10,34,83,28 August 2009
Dawn of the Dead," A remake to die for!
","This remake of the George A Romero cult zombie slasher contains everything a remake should. For this day and age it's hard to remake a film and to pull it off to make it as good as the original. In this case it quite literally succeeds immensely. Beware that this film contains pervasive strong bloody violence, horror and strong language. Moving off the MPAA rating you are delivered with not only a normal shoot em up zombie film, but also with a film that thrives the characters emotions and characteristics that have not been shown in a zombie film for quite some time. The story and plot are really well made, the cast could not have been a better assemble and the homage to the zombie/action/thriller category could not be surpassed.",8,0,0,22 February 2008
Iron Man 2," The first one steps all over this one
","The hype for Iron Man 2 to be great was pretty big, by me anyway. But i was let down considerably. Sequels are usually the ones that are much harder to get right and pull of, and Iron Man 2 nearly falls flat. The last thirty minutes are diabolically bad compared to the rest of the film, which, whilst it lasted, was pretty damn good. Things that could have certainly been improved upon were; Mickey Rourke as Whiplash, who i didn't think had enough screen time, and could have been fleshed out slightly better. The introduction of War Machine fighting alongside his ally Iron Man, was completely inappropriate as it made the climactic fight sequence corny and stupid. His fight with Iron Man at Starks home was also un called for, as if the director was adding the sequence just for the sake for a longer running time. Also, Starks witty personality died out pretty quickly, so we are left annoyed and pleading him to stop by the credits.",5,65,129,30 April 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," One of the best
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review:Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a 10/10 swashbuckling, wind whirling and sword clanging action adventure film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Johnny Depp is at a sheer peak performance as the whizzy 'Captain' Jack Sparrow and one that got him an Oscar nomination for best actor. Depp clearly steals the show and brings down the house with an all amazing performance.It's story is a blessing for this certain genre and thank god Verbinski did it right. He nails it to the point where you wouldn't presume it's a normal story but still treats it in that fashion.But it's the knife-sharp dialogue that plays the real part and Depp unsurprisingly pulls it to the top (Savvey?)Verdict:Pirates of the Carribena: the Curse of the Black Pearl is a pure adventure to watch. Depp at his all time best, unforgettable dialogue and Keira Knightley in a corset. How could you go wrong?*****Classic",10,0,3,3 November 2008
Public Enemies," A definite contender for best Picture
","Public Enemies is quite simply a masterpiece. With outstanding performances from Depp as well as a unique one form Bale, both seemed undisputed and masterful with a bold as well as having an over-whelming cinematic presence every time both actor's were on the screen. Michael Mann is truly at his peak and Public Enemies proves to be his best piece of cinematic brilliance yet. shot in glorious HD, Mann brings a new inspiration to his already hugely bold status as one of the best crime drama director's working today. Running in the same streak and coollness as past gangster epic's such as Scarface or The Godfather, Public Enemies roar's through it's long running time of two and a half hours without letting up the pace or action.If Depp doesn't even get nominated for his brutal as well as charming character as John Dillinger i will be mad. Every aspect of Depp's performance is indisputably mesmerising and the best of it is that he look's like he isn't even having to try to play the character.",10,1,5,7 July 2009
Oldboy," Just no
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:Oldboy is not for everyone. It's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.The film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.It's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.Oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.Verdict:Not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*Tragic",1,16,35,5 December 2008
Spider-Man 2," Let down by a rubbish villain, weak dialogue but an average story
","Spiderman 2 is not as exciting or brilliant as its predecessor. The villain (Otto Octavius) is just sheer rubbish. Hes not as threatening to Spider Man as the Green Goblin, and could of easily been played by a better actor. The dialogue is, in most parts really cheesy and you would expect to see that in a forty's film but definitely not in Spider Man. It drags a lot of the time as well, as if your begging it to move on.There are also some scenes in Spider Man 2 that could have easily been taken out. For instance the bit when Aunt May is taken up the building by Doc Oc and Spider Man has to save her and when Doc Oc shouts NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO felt embarrassing and easily could of been altered. That leaves the story which is the only average bit to remember this film for. OK it may drift in some and gain speed in other areas but on a whole its averageThats all that Spider Man 2 is really: Average and a disappointment to what it was hyped up to be.",6,1,3,6 August 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Just a bad film in all areas.
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is your typical and generic Superhero movie that delves deeper into it's own troubles and mistakes as you watch further into the film. Jackman is not a convincing Wolverine, well at least for the majority of the film he isn't. Audiences are meant to feel for what he is going through e.t.c. But you won't get that feeling because no life or soul is put into the development of Wolverine.The direction is shameful and definitely undesirable. The same shots are used over and over again to give the film a cynical and un-professional angst to it. Hood clearly doesn't give a toss about the film's morals and objectives for its audience but just wants action. Even these violent and stupid scenes don't have the emotionality devised in other such Superhero movies like Spiderman or Batman Begins.Overall X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a stupid and rushed Superhero movie that has lost all control and emotion because of the director inconsiderate use of action over story.",1,41,86,18 April 2009
Constantine," Strange but entertaining
","Constantine is a good supernatural/ horror film directed by Frances Lawrence (I am Legend.) The elements of good horror mixed with an action extravaganza both keep the audience entertained and thrilled. At the same time, the story also is fast and on par between any horror film since The Sixth Sense. Constantine not only is good in these areas but also in the special effects and cinematography departments which make the film feel dark and disturbing. Speaking of dark and disturbing being two of the main moods of the story, the other moods also give context and originality to its layers.The only thing i can uphold about is, in some scenes its a bit far-fetched but, not that you haven't realised.",7,1,2,25 August 2008
Troy," A great, great film in every aspect
","No matter what version it is, i.e. the theatrical or directors cut Troy is still simply awe-inspiring and flawless. From the acting through to direction, this film doesn't slip up at any stage in the film. All the cast are fully descriptive and emotionally filled leaving the audiences with a gasp of greatness. For with every new scene comes a greater and more defining perspective of what homers Illiad was meant to look and sound like. Wolfgang Peterson (the Posiedon) has embellished the film with a new brilliance, one which i haven't seen in a long time in any film. The cast add value and give gifted life to all their characters, without leaving or forgetting anyone involved. The action sequences are somewhat majestic and moving, as is the poetic and resoundingly perfect score by James Horner.The screenplay and script are relentlessly shed. The choreography is set to stand time. But what audiences are left with is, a compelling, visually, acted and directed knockout of a phenomenon.",10,4,10,27 April 2008
Terminator Salvation," Prepare to be blown away!
","Terminator Salvation is a heart thumping, nerve-shredding and action packed thrill ride and holds a strong eye for invention and story. Basically Terminator Salvation is a mile times better than its predecessor, for which many people thought would be the end of The Terminator franchise, but not for McG. The man who lacks the common decency to have a full name has achieved an epic looking and emotional picture that has re-ignited a franchise and who has positioned himself as an excellent action film director.Gone is the slick LA of the 20/21st century, replaced with dark underground bunkers and huge robot factory cities. Also gone is the normal endoskelaton chases human story and replaced with a 'men on a mission' adventure. The adventure aspect is as every bit as thrilling as it is enigmatic, which takes McG to more of an accomplished insight into the Terminator universe.The action is chilling and absolutely extraordinary and breathes a fresh set of light to the story. Unlike other Terminator films of the passed, Terminator Salvation up's the anti and action to beyond the other entries. The only downfall i can comment on is the use of some corny dialogue, but like previous Terminator films they wouldn't work without it.My verdict overall though is that McG has sparked a new light and interest into the Terminator franchise and is one that gives all the post apocalyptic action fans have been waiting to see.",8,1,2,7 June 2009
Zodiac," David Fincher continues his trend of classic films.
","A masterpiece? Deffinatley it is. David Fincher, director of classics like Fight Club and Se7en brings audiences one of the best films of all time and certainly one of the best of the decade. Zodiac brings together powerful performances with a complex but harrowing story and perfect directing. If ever having to decide what one of the best acted films were of all time, Zodiac would definitely be up there.The story is intriguing and gripping as is the searing acting capabilities of Downey Jr and Ghylenahall. Both unforgettable and classic.The narrative is dark but powerful and at most times creepy and thrilling. The most plausible though are the directing and acting. Fincher who has outdone himself weaves a timeless trail of gripping shots and angles that make you sit back and enjoy. OK despite being 2 hours 45 minutes running time and which is taken up by mostly talking, please just sit down and be patient with the films approach. Which leaks a hell of a lot of character as well as plot substance. But believe me the imagination of this master at work is both brilliant and compelling and you wont regret seeing this film.",10,0,2,9 October 2008
The Prestige," Real Magic!
","The Prestige is significantly brilliant. From the tense acting to the beautiful directing, all the aspects exceed my expectations. Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento and The Dark Knight) continues to pursue brilliance. And quite literally has reached it. All of his films are of such perfection that no other director that i can think of could ever come close. His efforts in creating The Dark Knight for example are beyond anything i have ever seen before.Christian Bale (American Phyco) and Huge Jackman (X-Men)both play rival magicians. But when Alfred (Bale) performs the ultimate magic trick, his former friend turned enemy Robert (Jackman)tries to find the secret in the trick. Each twist and trick leaves the audience wanting more and when the credits roll you would feel like this film is deserving need of the best picture Oscar. And quite rightly so.",10,4,6,3 August 2008
Silent Hill," A film with no heart
","Silent Hill is a very poor film. All areas are shambled with nothing in. Characters, plot, screenplay everything you can think of is missing. The cast adds to this addition of poorly shaped characters and a realisation that a game like that cant be copied to a film like this. Everything the game achieved the film failed. The plot is all over the place, plot holes being left and forgotten, acting that looks shameful and cheesy and finally effects that look like they would use in a B movie. The amount of clichés is unbearable and a disgrace on the horror genre.This film really should be kept SILENT and not talked about ever again.",1,1,5,22 August 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Newman's Best film
","This is a true great majestic western action adventure all provided by Paul Newman, Robert Redford and of coarse the director of the film- George Roy Hill. First of, the chemistry between Newman and Redford are nothing short of absolute magic. The direction from George Roy Hill is epic and sweeping and puts the audience in the time of fast sharp shooters and valiant heroes.The comedy put into the characters of Newman and Redford are classy and intelligent, the action is also as much use as the comedy- brilliant sophisticated and incomparable. So if you are looking for a western that has comedy, action, romance and adventure. Then look no further than Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, let your imagination sour.",10,3,5,13 October 2007
Crash," A very good drama that hits the right notes.
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review:Set over the coarse of two nights and one day, Crash explores the issues of race on different people throughout L.A. Throughout the movie these different lives crash and collide with each other with unexpected results.The brilliance of the acting, direction and screenplay show the capabilities of Paul Haggis's genius. The plot is thick of character and substance from start to end and doesn't linger to go for greatness in which it highly succeeds.The screenplay is highly impressive as it weaves great lengths into showing the different issues that the film features. Its these features that help travel the film to the end without the audience feeling disappointed or wanting their money back.Having a high ensemble cast such as Cheadle, Bullock, Fraser, Dillon, Newton and Phillipe gives the film even more of a sustained power. Each set of actors give a such a high calibre of emotion that it couldn't really have paid of without the work of Haggis or a good screenplay.Veridct:A daunting perceptive and unequalled examination of controversial subject matters that is rivetingly performed and profoundly directed.****Excellent",8,0,4,30 October 2008
Shutter Island," Chilling, compelling, terrifying and completely electric from start to finish
","Shutter Island could be considered to rank among Martin Scorsese's greatest films to date. And it certainly lives up to that status. From it's compelling beginning to it's 'oh my god i didn't see that coming' finale, you will be held on the edge of your seat. What makes Shutter Island work tremendously well is it's complete lack of knowing what will come next. Every scene leads to something new and original, nothing feels dud or stupid. It's Islands psychological aspects implanted within a forever changing narrative that will have audiences always asking why?, how? or what?, and not until the very end will you at least have a small idea about what you have seen. Could it be considered one of the best of the year so far? Definitely.The atmosphere is completely terrifying, as if you are as scared and nervous as Teddy himself, if that's his actual name. Scorsese further unleashes a wide inventory of cinematography that makes you go 'wow'. His perfectionism is absolutely necessary, especially for this type of film. Not once do you switch off or say 'well that was boring'. Your always left craving more.",10,2,9,21 February 2010
Forrest Gump," A legendary masterful film
","Pure and emotional, strong and up-right, this film has it all. Wonderful characters, beautiful direction and a very strong story. Tom Hanks is in his wonderful best as Forrest Gump, a man who may not be very clever but indeed carry's a good and caring heart. This is a truly mesmerising and heavy film, with all the right ingredients. Hanks has donned his best here, and created an academy award with his stunning performance.But see this film without a doubt, carry it through life and watch it time and time again. The emotional charisma makes it the whole more better.Cry, stand and salute a brilliant film. Forrest Gump is right up in the front row of Hollywood's all time masterpieces.",10,2,5,20 August 2007
The Godfather: Part II," Not as good as the first, but still CLASSIC
","This was not as good as the first, but still a really great film. With its ultra violent execution scenes and well deserved credited acting marks the second film in the ultimate gangster franchise. Director Francis Ford Coppola thought of the need to only make two films, this one and the first, but he didn't really intend to make a third but in the end did. Truly though, the first two were the best, i think there was no apparent reason for making the third one, which is supposed to be the worst/not as good one, compared to the first two classics. Number two follows Michael Corleones early life. It flash backs every now and then to his father Don Corleone played by Robert De Niro who does some dirty deals and some killings. So there are two parts to the story, these are: Michael, in present form and Don Corleone, so you can see what Don Corleone did to become Don.The acting is top quality, most probably one of Al Pacinos greatest moments to shine and Robert De Niro, who also ma not be leading actor but still acts like he is. Diana Keaton, who plays Michael wife also demonstrates that she can bring to life the suffering and shocking conclusion of Michael and her splitting up, as you will see in the third one.This film including the acting and direction all made this film worth wild, because of the extreme enthusiasm and dedication from both the cast and film crew.",9,0,4,25 March 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," easily one of the best films ever made.
","The Bourne Ultimatum is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. The action, the thrills and excitement easily surpass Identity and Supremacy as does Greengrass's ability to deliver a good plot that is thick on detail and uncompromisingly superior to both predecessors. Paul Greengrass (United 93) has out-done himself in creating a hard hitting action thriller that places both Greengrass and Damon in a dominant position that ponders the question- Should they do another Bourne? And with the over-whelming success of Ultimatum why shouldn't they continue.The choreography is unmistakably class as is the brutal and explosive action scenes that'l keep you on the edge. The acting is searing and certainly gripping. Ultimatum is a thrill ride so riveting and bold that it should be cast as the best action thriller of the past decade and immediately called upon as one of the greats of cinematic history.",10,3,6,21 September 2008
Fargo," Can the Coen Brothers please go back to comedies!!!!
","Fargo is inevitably a ruined film. The directing, story and screenplay. The reason i dare not say acting is because it is, on one hand fun and indulging to watch, but on the other it is a near missed opportunity for greatness. I know the Coen brothers didn't make O brother where art Now before Fargo, but just goes to show that a good choice of actor/actresses can carry a film regardless of other elements e.g. story, directing e.t.cTo me, this is is not a classic as others are saying but a missed chance of greatness that sadly thrives for excellence but just cant reach. The acting is the only joy i had watching this, but just saying this doesn't make the film any more than average.",6,0,1,14 July 2008
Léon: The Professional," Monumental piece of cinema
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review: Leon is fast, lively, dark and magnificent all the way. At running just over 2 hours, Leon tells the story of a 12 year-old orphan girl who is taken in by a ruthless assassin who -at her request - trains her in the art of the hit man. At the heart of this masterpiece lies substance and ferocity that is done in such style and flair you would be blown away.Beeson, who, previously had directed such films as Nikita and The Big Blue has simply crafted a film that no other director in Hollywood could have crafted. The music, acting, direction and story all pay off brilliantly and shed a light that hadn't been seen before. Take for example the acting, genuinely moving and emotionally charged. Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman all excel with dynamic and star powered performances. Gary Oldman is as brilliant as ever before making Stansfeild a corrupt and violent character one wouldn't want to cross. As for Reno's and Portman's performances they remain unchallenged.Beeson delights when coming to the big action sequences. Fast, brutal and stylish in approach are the Beeson payoffs. The music plays like a self taught orchestra, scene after scene has a meandering and thoughtful score.Verdict:Leon is full of memorable scenes and characters. Beesons direction is top class and the front running performances are perfect.",10,6,8,21 November 2008
Watchmen," An excellent film. Snyder has redefined the way we look at movies............... forever
","Watchmen is an exceptionally well made film that sheds new light and brings larger depths to character and story like never before. I mean the sincere amount of detail spread over each character is mesmerising. To add to this, the story also adds a more expansive and thoughtful depth as well. It not only makes you think, but is completely exciting as well.The characters each have their own unique emotions that make you actually care for them. Snyder has particularly done this aspect very well. The violence is, brutal and exceedingly violent to any age of person. There's heads being cut into by meat cleavers, bones being snapped out, arms being cut off and so on. To all the previous reviews saying that Watchmen is boring and is really slow, don't listen to them. The story flows consistently and doesn't feel boring or lacking at any time, and the help of flashbacks also add a greater excitement and adventure to this piece of movie excellence.Overall the film is a master piece and should be re-watched year after year by anyone who loves film and who wants to watch a detailed and exciting action thriller.",10,1,6,8 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Oh Dear what have they done
","The Matrix Revolutions marks the third and final chapter in the Matrix trilogy. Compared to it's two predecessors this shouldn't even be legal to watch! It has nothing in common to the two past films. The action is appalling and beyond anything but shameful, the story is just too slow and doesn't really develop itself like the others did. The acting is as bad as watching Talledaga Nights and the direction is of The Wachoski's worst efforts. They add stupid sub characters that are irrelevant to the story that are just added there to annoy the living hell out of everyone. The sub plots are too cramped with dialogue that its hard not to go to sleep. OK the sub plots in Reloaded were fine, balanced with intriguing acting and powerful action but Revolutios take the sub plots and inter-wines them with baffled dialogue.So all in all the Wachoski's have practically ruined the Matrix Trilogy. Despitre this being said still watch one and two but stop there.",1,1,4,9 September 2008
28 Weeks Later," Equals the original in every aspect.
","28 Weeks Later is, as you might already know a follow on from Danny Boyle's British horror shocker from 2002. To achieve such a film like 28 Weeks Later is terrific and brilliant weather it be technically or narratively, 'Weeks' has it all. From it's riveting but highly terrifying opening attack through to the spine-chilling shot of the zombies sprinting to the Eiffal Tower, 'Weeks' escapes the some-times narrow mindlessness from the first film and brings a new depth and life to it.To succeed over 'Days' is a mammoth task, but director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has conquered and even be-wildered all. The direction is searing and definitely nerve-shredding at times because of the heights of edge of you seat tension created. The action compared to 'Days' is 100 times gorier and blood-soaked than before and Fresnadillo doesn't hide this.",10,4,8,2 March 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," Sublime Horror
","The Hills Have Eyes is a very good, detailed and genuine take as a remake of the original directed by Wes Craven. Cravens artistry bellowed power and significance among most of the horror films he had directed. The remake is by far scarier, more sadistic, more terrifying and gut wrenchingly bloodier than its original. Great horror to me hasn't been created by anyone since The Exorcist (1973) or The Shining (1980.) These two iconic films stand the test of time as great tributes to the horror genre, and i think The Hills Have Eyes (2006) has nearly reached this level. Mabe not as one of the defining classics but certainly a worthy mention.",8,0,1,22 August 2008
The Shining," Stanley Kurbricks finest moment
","Stanley Kurbrick is among one of the most brilliant and influential directors of all time, and The Shining is his perfect example. Mixing high calibre acting, bone chilling cinematography and searingly elegant directing Stanley Kurbrick weaves a story so mesmerising and unforgettable that it would be impossible to not come out feeling horrified. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give perfect performances that at times are so eerie and tense that you could definitely consider them Oscar nominees. Each haunting stage Nicholson goes through throughout the film becomes a tour De Force. From a well mannered and well respected person through to a delusional and utterly insane maniac Nicholson gives genius as well as wit.The Shining to conclude is Kurbricks finest moment. Filled both with grand horror, searingly well crafted acting, a powerful and imaginative story and a work of genuine powerful film-making.",10,1,1,19 August 2008
Wanted," Good Film
","Wanted is a great out of this world and totally unbelievable action film that stays true and close to the action. Jolie and Mcavoy truly are on form delivering slick lines as well as hyping up the timelessly exciting action. Morgan Freeman is as usual his mainstream best playing the villain and ho also delivers one of the best lines of the - 'Shoot this mother fuc*er!' I mean what kind of an old man would say that these day. The slow motion shots credit the directors work and ability to make a memorable action film. Although a bit repetitive, Wanted doesn't disappoint or let the viewer feel ashamed because it's trying to be like The Matrix. But the good thing is that it can relate to it and in a positive way.By all means Wanted is definitely not a classic as such is The Matrix, but for complexity, action and the wicked slow motion it is like it.",8,1,4,22 October 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Bold and Brilliant!
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not only 100 times better than its predecessor but is stands out as one of the most influential, captivating and awe-inspiring sequels ever made, and is certainly Arnnies best. The action, the excitement and the adventure are all hyped up to better than its average previous encounter (The Terminator,) and it definitely is. It places T2 on a new level of action and excitement that hadn't been seen before.The film places Schwarzenegger as the Terminator sent back through time to find and protect Sarah Connors son John Connor. With Schwarzenegger though, comes another Terminator (Robert Patrick) destined to annihilate John Connor.This is pretty much a flawless film. The story i think is one of the best and most original to be made, the action whizzes past you at lightning bolt speed, the acting is masterclass and Arnnies all-time best.",10,1,2,29 August 2008
Jarhead," Welcome to the Suck!
","All though understated by many, Jarhead remains one of the most realistic and powerful war films of time. The power in the film is raw and up-beat, emotional and tragic, humorous and sad. All of these are present throughout and stick with you way after the film has ended. For once since 1998's Saving Private Ryan a skilled director like Mendes can put the audience in the shoes of a soldier fighting for his country. Not only does the director achieve this aspect greatly but then makes the experience and realisation of war seem real, graphic and accurate. By no means the greatest film ever made but for story, acting, directing and cinematography Jarhead is certainly near ace among those categories. Jamie Foxx gives a sensational performance and Staff Sergant Sykes, and without his presence this film would not have been the greatness it is.",9,1,1,11 October 2008
Collateral," Mann's best and deliver's one of the finest film's of all time
","Collateral is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and riveting film's of all time. Combined with top notch direction and acting, Michael Mann has produced a fresh and captivating action thriller that is destined to be one of a kind. This is a thriller that is perfectly thrilling and highly enjoyable at whatever aspect you look at it from.The seedy, dim-lit light of L.A. is astonishing and brings the audience in closer to the story in which Collateral takes pace in. The acting is even more fantastic and proves to be witty as well as nail biting. Cruise is in cruise control and whirl's up a fantastic performance as contract killer Vincent. On the other hand there is Jamie Foxx who, is just as polished and excellent as Cruise who equally shares his acting brilliance through each scene with Foxx.",10,1,1,7 July 2009
The Exorcist," You will never forget!!!!!!!!!!!!
","The Exorcist has become the greatest horror film ever to be watched by audiences, delivering thrills, suspense, story, drama, excitement and thoroughly disturbing and igniting large chills down your back that makes you not want to watch it again. Once watched once, this film WILL stick with you for the rest of your life and never leave you.Its a shame there were sequels after the first film, i haven't seen any but i'm sticking to and only the first one. The Exocist IS most definitely one of the greatest films i have ever witnessed, and certainly the greatest horror ever watched. By all means you would only have to watch this movie once to be absolutely freaked and completely disturbed.",6,0,3,28 August 2007
Saw III," Suffering, i've seen quite enough thanks!
","After the average Saw 2 i was kind of expecting the same for Saw 3, But how dreadfully wrong i was. Everything is unorthodox and completely unoriginal (like you haven't noticed already!) Saw 3 is a blatantly staggering misshaped concept of a failed saga- APART FROM NUMBER 1. The acting and sustainability has speedily decreased from the 1st and 2nd Saw movies. The acting only resembles of a poor quality and sticks like that for the whole 1 hour 50 minutes! The story remains horrible and absolutely stupid. All that ever happens and in which you see is blood, guts and gore throughout. Nothing with a twist or nerve-shredding appears. By the third you would have hoped Lynn Bousman would have toned different mixes and created something different but keeping within the contents of originality.Sadly Saw 3 is a poor and absolute crap 'b' movie that shouldn't even be legal, and not for the graphic violent content.",1,0,2,18 October 2008
The Usual Suspects," A bold, stylish and mind bending thriller, Singer at his best
","The Usual Suspects is a film superbly directed, acted and scripted it could just pass as one of the best of it's kind. The various layers and dishes served upon the final production can only be looked upon as epic and intimate. Not only is The Usual Suspects a rare first-class thriller, but a power-house phenomenon that one would have to be re-watched time and time again. Taken into account the flawless direction and 'can't be bettered' script, it's the acting that bubbles the most. Spacey's performance is outstanding and possibly one of the finest to have been watched. Not forgetting the rest of the sheer class of acting brilliance which was; Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite.The Usual Susupects is a cult classic that rightly deserves it's acclaimed status.",10,0,0,22 February 2009
Quantum of Solace," Perfect in every way possible.
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review: Not only is Quantum of Solace better than it's predecessor but also is one of the best of the decade. Expect great amounts of action, adventure and thrills as Craig gives Bond the full measurement of power and adrenaline thats needed for a successful follow up to the widely acclaimed Casino Royale.The action is 100 times better than in the previous instalment and shows the gradual increase of fast and fierce brutality by master Bourne choreographer Dan Bradley. The sequences move fast, furiously and brilliantly. The action also positively shows that a director can keep this faithful as well as a spot on story on the top.Daniel Craig enhances his Bond to great heights and gives him an even more gruelling and bloodier look than the previous film. Craig fully demonstrates he is Bond and that he's the best one for the job.The cinematography layers the film up together and gives the film an ideal look as to where the film takes place.The direction is perfect from Marc Forster (The Kite Runners) who vividly and imaginatively creates an action adventure for the most humble of Bourne fans. The shots are wide and various but equally match up to a classic Bond film.Verdict:A visually stylish classic that can proudly hold nods up against all the other Bond movies.",10,8,19,1 November 2008
District 9," A very highly overrated Sci-fi film.
","District 9 isn't in any way a masterpiece or epic in any case. But instead is highly overrated trash than can only seek good reviews from the air-heads that look at District 9's viral marketing. That aspect is the only reason why people have liked the film. As it suggests in the trailer that District 9 is going to be an epic sci-fi masterpiece, they were wrong! So many people fall for this trick. Firstly, the use of a hand-held camera completely takes the audience out of the experience unlike Public Enemies. But then again the director (Michael Mann) was experienced. Unlike Neill Blomkamp who directed District 9, and is an inexperienced director despite under the guidance of Peter Jackson who should have taken over the project from the start and should have scrapped Blomkamp.Secondly, the direction is awful. I mean what humans can's understand Alien language and then respond to whatever it is the aliens are saying. The shot's in individual parts are repetitive and lousy. And finally the acting is shameful and embarrassing and the hand-held camera doesn't help in any way either.",2,13,30,18 August 2009
Batman Begins," Your gonna love every minute!
","This film alone can be cast as one of, if not the best superhero movie of all time. It also can stand it's boldness and excellence outside the superhero category, meaning it is both a brilliant film on it's own two feet and as a classic superhero film that one could watch over and over again. Everything en-thrills this classic to be what it is. Christian Bale can once again be looked at as, not just a corrupt lunatic (American Phyco) but as an actor who enhances his talents to the full, weather it be a hero or villain. Christopher Nolen directs quite possibly his best film to date. Cunning angles, exhilarating action sequences, solid acting and on and on. The list is endless into the directors unique and imaginative use of all areas of the field. To conclude: Batman Begins is an inch by inch movie classic, that even the old Batman films should look upon and feel a large poignant stake of disappointment that their films could and never compare to this genre defining classic.",10,2,2,21 June 2008
Saving Private Ryan," The most brilliant war movie ever to be made thus far
","Forget Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter Saving Private Ryan is the best bar none. The acting is monumental and the action is even more so. From it's gruelling cinematic opening through to it's profound ending, Saving Private Ryan delivers on all sides of excellence. Tom Hanks is compelling as Captain John H. Miller. Hanks hasn't portrayed anyone quite as captivating since his 1994 Oscar winning success in Forrest Gump.The visual concept is staggering and undeniably excels anything in the war genre. Praise to Spielburg though for giving audiences a tragic look inside to the horrors of war and its various other hellish topics.Cudoes to Saving Private Ryan's raw beauty and magnificence in re-creating the bloodiness and nightmarish abyss that was war. This being said, Saving Private Ryan is the best war film simply put and its visceral grit and substances shine boldly among others.",10,2,4,2 September 2008
28 Days Later...," A chilling British horror
","28 Days Later is a hyper-kinetic and adrenaline fuelled British horror directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting). The film takes place in modern day Britain where a virus known as the rage virus has been used and has made all those who come into contact with it turn into blood-thirsty zombies.Boyle directs the film as if biographical, of this man who wakes up alone in a hospital to find no one is left, who then has to run for his life to get away. Boyle makes this an experience worth watching as he flicks the camera here to there especially when an oncoming attack of the zombies approaches.The setting is the key player from the beginning which evidently doesn't show any sign of stopping throughout the duration of the film. This helps create's the tension when needed to give the audience a thrill of insecurity about what's going to happen.",10,6,10,2 March 2009
Schindler's List," Powerful, moving and thrilling, definitely one of the greatest films of all time
","****Classic ****Excellant ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:Shindlers List is a riveting experience from start to end. The resounding performances, the emotional score, the visceral and beautiful direction, the landslide powerhouse cinematography and so the list forever goes on. Spielburg has crafted a masterpiece that sculpulates the granger, the brutality and sadness of the Holocaust. Only one kind of director could have designed and re-shaped the emotionalness, the stomach-churning violence and a cascading event that will forever stay embedded in our minds. That director was Steven Spielburg.The story, though simplistic, is told in a profound vision that one could only feel like they were there, and Spielburg creates this perfectly.The story is as follows: Oskar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war. He witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews, and starts to save them.The way the whole film is shot is only part of it's magnificence, but Spielburg provides substance and deep methodic styles to accompany this with.Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes all provide magnificent and powerful performances that only when thinking about it resembles the motives and detail of the characters that are so boldly and tightly-suited to perfection.The decision to put the film in black and white is exactly true to the time and places that the film took place around.The backdrops and cold baron Polish wastelands show the best cinematography from Spielburg.Verdict:A phenomenal account of ones mans passion for saving not one life, but many. Spielburg still proves he's the master of modern cinema by delivering a resounding and heart in-sighted belief of showing the most moving event in history.",10,9,13,28 November 2008
I Am Legend," best movie of the year!!!!!!!
","Without a shade of a doubt, this is true to the horror/action/suspense movie, deserving of all the qualities to get Oscars. The acting is there, the story/plot is very eye catching and the horror and suspense atmosphere could not have been better. Will Smith is in one of his acting primes all throughout the film, the atmosphere of suspense and darkness surrounds and captures the audience. If ever wanting to go and witness a bid for your money's worth, go and see I am Legend. Taking into account also is the loneliness Will Smith's character goes through each stage of the film.A definite for best actor and possibly film.",7,2,5,24 January 2008
Kick-Ass," This film rocked!
","Kick Ass is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year, and we haven't even reached July yet! The hype surrounding this film truly was real, and didn't seem a tall like a con. If you want action, then you get action, in bucket loads. The violence is served in a comedic and brutal style that is pure brilliance to watch. It delivers again and again, without making you wait, or feel bored- not in Kick Ass! The comedy i also thought worked exceedingly well, and at the most unusual of places. To sum Kick Ass up, it is a full throttle roller-coaster ride that will have you gagging for more and more, and gives it to you upfront in what is surely to go down as one of the best films of the year.",10,2,22,26 March 2010
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood at his very best
","Review: Clint Eastwood performs a knock-out and surely Oscar worthy performance as a disgruntled Korean War vet called Walt Kowalski. The plot, though simple in substance and style is brilliantly planned and educated. The film follows a disgruntled Korean war veteran named Walt Kowalski, who sets out to reform his neighbour, a young Hmong teenager, who tried to steal Kowalski's prized possession: his 1972 Gran Torino.Whilst both electric and brilliant, Eastwood fully acts his character to the bone and it shows that this is a character that has been perfectly created by Eastwood himself. Every aspect is detailed and visually amazing. Eastwood also shows us his dramatic and comedic side to Kowalski. The direction by Eastwood is powerful and imaginative which flows as boldly as the story. The backdrop to the film is mystic and thrilling as you don't now what's going to happen next, and Eastwood has crafted this brilliantly which keeps audiences on the edge.Verdict:Never since The Outlaw Josey Wales has Eastwood portrayed a character so thrilling and as exciting as Walt Kawolski. All in all this is a powerhouse performance which should get Easttwood an Oscar and a definite Director nod.",9,23,41,14 December 2008
Hero," Quality entertainment at a very high level.
","*****Classic ****Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic Review: Hero is no ordinary martial arts extravaganza, instead it surpasses all others by a fair and far mile. Jet Li plays an assassin called Nameless who visits a warlord in 3rd century BC China to describe how he killed three of the Warlords most terrifying enemies. But the truth may not be as it's said.Put aside Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and replace with Hero and you have got a better film. Hero is so fantastic and adventurous with it's buzzy plot that you would have thought you had seen it all. But beside the all dramatic plot lies some of the most all brilliant and perfected cinematography you have out eyes upon. It's martial arts action is simply unrivalled and incomparable to anything set before it.Zhang Yimou's direction is instantly plausible as you get the feel that this is a master's working. Yimou gives audiences the taste of fierce martial arts brutality as well as poetic and intriguing acting.Verdict:Hero is by far the greatest and most gracious martial arts epic ever amounted. The direction, acting and cinematography clearly shine through as being some of the most bold and commanding of all time.*****Classic",10,1,2,29 October 2008
The Hurt Locker," Thoroughly enjoyable.
","The Hurt Locker is, quite simply put, a masterpiece. The suspense and action flow from the screen and enlighten what what we are witnessing before us. The cinematography is pitch-perfect and allows the audience to be captivated by it. The shaky, nerve jaggling effects used are placed well and keep you on the very edge of your seat. The action sequences, well, they are something else. The carefully detailed constructed set pieces are delivered with much brilliance and skill that they are bound to be caught within your mind for quite some time. The smart, quirky dialogue captures the essence and gives the audience something to laugh with.",10,9,27,9 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A haunting and forever lasting film
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one film that has defined watching films as a whole. It's emotional, clever, witty and epic in all the right ways possible. The film makes audiences think of the value of life and how important a special moment is. As the tag line states-'Life isn't measured in minutes but in moments' which brings the film to a more profound and dramatic level of a cinematic experience.The concept is viscerally brilliant to watch as is the unique and bold direction led by David Fincher. The acting though of coarse, is something beyond the extraordinary and is accomplished in great leaps and bounds by the two leads. Up to this point in his film career, Brad Pitt has served his most emotional and boldy moving part to date. I couldn't honestly think of another actor of our generation who could have done a better job, and Pitt absolutely nailed it. Every line is spoken in an extremely emotional way as if it were him actually there.The direction is a masterpiece in it's own accord and thoroughly brings Fincher to master status and one of Hollywood's brightest directors working today. Every scene is composed in thought and emotion and clearly delivers Fincher as a director of huge importance.Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a forever lasting film that will be remembered for generations to come.",10,3,6,10 June 2009
Transformers," An ultimate visual and action packed thrill ride.
","A visual treat for everyone and very very enjoyable. Michael Bay has brought back cinema audiences down to an amazing action packed experience through his latest cinema flick Transformers. From executive producer Steven Spielberg, Transformers enters you into a whole new way of cinema, creating dazzling special effects, a cool-ice story line and normal and interesting down to earth characters.Two types of robots: the autobots, led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons who are led by the dark Megatron, both take their battle to earth in search of the Allspark, a mystical block in which anyone who possesses it would gain ultimate power. When on earth, the autobots and the decepticons all hide in every day form from cars and trucks to aeroplanes, all of which are in search for the Allspark. Soon after, the fate of the earth rests in the hands of young and chatty teenager Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) who's great grandfather found an ancient discovery in 1850, finding the decepticon leader Megatron frozen and captivated deep under the arctic circle. Soon after his discovery he is killed by Megatron through his awakening, and leaving the only key item of the whereabouts of the Allspark. Which is in Sam's great grandfathers glasses, which give the location of the infamous all spark.This is just the background of the movie giving only minor spoilers instead of writing out the whole story which gives major spoilers for the people out their waiting to go and see it. Which i thoroughly recommend you do. With its sections of bright comedy and state of the art technology, bringing to life the huge CGI autobots and decepticons and blending a swell motivating story with its all round edge of your seat action. This to me making this movie a no doubt hit of the summer and certainly revving up a few Oscars- special effects and possibly in my opinion a best director statuette. But we will have to wait and see, but don't hinder or be put of by the idea that Transformers is a childish movie cause its not. Its simply AMAZING.",8,4,7,31 July 2007
Children of Men," A chilling and monumental piece of cinema
","Children of Men is a film so hellbent on making the audience emotional and exhilarated that it looks like it doesn't even need to try. The outlook is visually gripping as well as chilling which sets the tone from start to end, and at times feels like you are their. The acting is brilliant and fresh but in small instances can be slightly clumsy. Owen maintains excellence and efficiency into believing in his character and his morales.Direction wise, it's boldly terrific. The shots are steady and expand on the fact that Cuaron is a well perceived director at the top of his game. The action scenes are brutal and riveting all at once and all are executed in a chilling and brilliant sense that they will be hard to forget.",8,2,11,13 April 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's second greatest achievement, and one of the best viusal experiences ever!
","Firstly Reseviour Dogs secondly Pulp Fiction thirdly Jackie Brown fourthly KILL BILL: VOLUME 1!!!!!!!!! This is the forth landmark film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, who does not slip up negativity on 95% of his films. This is a true vengeance movie serving up lots and lots of blood and gore and fine acting from Urma Thurman and Lucy Liu. Director Quentin Tarantino has produced yet another masterful epic, and the story couldn't have been better.Urma Thurman plays 'the Bride', who was gunned down at her wedding by the notorious Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Taking a bullet to the head by her ex lover 'Bill' The Bride wakes from a coma, realising her pregnant baby had gone. When awoken she seeks revenge upon the five members of the Assassination Squad who destroyed her life and her baby.One of the very finest Tarantino films i have ever seen along with Pulp Fiction, i have not yet seen Kill Bill Volume 2, but i certainly intend to, without a doubt.

Saw II," A quite good sequel, but no way near the power of the first one
","Saw 2 sets of where Saw ends. It is more violent and insanely bloody and to my surprise it kept the twists and turns at a good shock to audiences. If you have seen the classic Saw then you may be a bit disappointed with this bloodily bloated sequel. By all means go and enjoy but don't even think of seeing a masterpiece that was like the original. The story is by no means original- people are stuck in a house, they have to find an antidote to escape before a deadly gas infects their system, a cop and a Swat team are looking for them, the cop gets worried and goes on the run to find the people and then he gets locked up and Jigsaw (apparently) survives. Character wise its practically similar to those in Saw. Gore wise, its 100 times worse than the original. But when analysing this gory sequel no aspects really outdo the originality of it's predecessor. And so Saw 2 really comes down to originality and being able to surpass the technical and cinematic excellence of Saw. In some cases they nearly do, but in others they don't.But by all means a worthy sequel.",7,0,1,13 October 2008
Black Hawk Down," Ridleys worst
","Black Hawk Down is definitely the worst Ridley Scott film and for many reasons. Some being on the acting side, some on the technical aspect, others on direction and so on. Black Hawk Down though is only colourful in its rich choreography, which to me is what doesn't completely destroy the film, but only supports it on it's last legs. The acting isn't so good and clearly shows especially when the film is watched numerous times. And the funny thing is, that it has a heck of a lot of strong actors for each role but they don't shine. On direction terms i think that it isn't Scotts best and shows us that he isn't capable of directing a well balanced war film. The main issue though was the excessive amount of action that, to me isn't that bad but when it takes over the basis and substance of the story it becomes quite hard to continue watching.Black Hawk Down is a big disappointment and reveals Scott's weaker side to direct a memorable war film.",1,3,10,15 August 2008
The Dark Knight," A perfect film
","Films like these don't come along very often. Perfect acting, directing, music, characters, story, cinematography and so on. To me The Dark Knight is one of those examples that will be remembered for a very long time to come. Everything that has been said about how wonderful this film is is true.The action is massive and beyond epic. But in-between the high flying punches and explosions its the acting that sums up this mastery. All the actors prove their worth as masters of their profession.Christian Bale has characterised the greatest Batman ever. His portrayal as Batman is brilliant and we finally witness this characters struggles, ambitions and morales all onto screen for the first time.Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is so chilling and monumental, menacing and pure that no other actor could had pulled that off. His presence on screen lights up and your left with, what i consider to be the greatest performance by any actor.To conclude, The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Perfect in a sense that i think has never been seen before and that wont ever be seen again.R.I.P Heath Ledger",10,12,25,5 August 2008
Green Street Hooligans," The amount of pervasive violence and swearing is appalling.
","Films like Green Street are those types of films that put embarrassment to me. This is not because i am a British citizen but because i am appalled by the excessive amount of the vulgarity contained in this film. Its not only the violence by the way, but the lack of poorly conceived acting talent by Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.) I mean this person was in THE LORD OF THE RINGS! Three of the greatest films ever made and yet after their monumental success two years later he opts to take part in a football hooligans film. Mabe he thought the story was excellent, but in fact was rubbish. The cinematography also, well OK, credit for the mildly nice locations but apart from that it was trash.Everything from beginning to end was utterly forgettable and should be put down as one of the worst films ever made.",1,1,4,5 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Another great Ed Zwick film
","Like The Last Samurai before it, Blood Diamond blends good acting with brutal violence with a top-notch story. DiCaprio, Conelly and Hounsou all portray brilliance and show nerve and wit in their roles. The cinematography is grand and its almost as if Zwick has painted the scenery to perfection with little falseness and huge positiveness throughout. The characters are slick and emotional adding depth and grander to the overall feel of the movie. The story is set at a break-neck speed but works with building character development as well as being fit into the story. DiCaprio's performance is bold and genuine and worthy of his captivating Oscar nomination.Blood Diamond is another brilliant Ed Zwick film that is both full of character, story and an Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio. It may be a slight knock underneath Zwicks previous film The Last Samurai but Blood Diamond is a real knock to your teeth about truth, honour, life and death.A truly class film.",8,2,2,23 August 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Unforgettable. Once upon a time in America is Leone's best work.
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:Once upon a time in America is no ordinary gangster film. It's a Sergio Leone gangster film. The complex narrative, the searing direction and the perfect acting. Never since The Godfather in 1973 has a gangster film been so brutally made, so eccentric and masterful. Leone has crafted a classic that sets the standards of time to compare with.Ultimately America is so much more than a gangster epic. Certainly other familiar genres appear floating on it's layer- rival gangs, mass amount of money in suitcases, brutal violence and corrupt police. The more of a depth the film transcends into the more profound and exciting it appears.The narrative is poignant and complex, such to a degree that it seems impossible to make such a film of this complexity, But Leone has hit the spot like he did in creating the all living masterpieces that were the Fistful of Dollars Trilogy.Verdict:Once upon a time in America is a straight foreword classic. No question. It's characters, the endless joy of the complex narrative and it's master director perform wonders.",10,3,7,25 October 2008
Taken," An insight into one of the worst films ever made
","Review: Taken is as near stupid as it is ridiculous. It's over the top, poorly written which leaves for an un-healthy execution. The story follows a former spy who relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter, who has been forced into the slave trade. Now, you may think the story is worthwhile to tell but, when sat watching this mess those thoughts scatter away quite quickly. You may even want to consider leaving as well.Nesseon(Kingdom of Heaven) is suited in an ill-judged and indecent role that could possibly have bigger consequences for his career. The vibe throughout the film is dreading and consistent, as is the god-awful direction of Pierre Morel who films out shots like they mean nothing for a good film to follow. Verdict: A complete mess in all areas and should be avoided like the plague.",1,16,42,9 January 2009

Despite a rumoured budget of around $300 million, the film itself is a complete failure which lacks as much in substance as it does style. The main cause for this disaster, is primarily because of the one dimensional direction from the so called 'King of the world' James Cameron, who, previously had delivered two exceptionally great film's- The Terminator and Terminator 2. Almost every single shot throughout the gigantic and over-long running time consists of panning shots and those similar. Once noticed, it's only a matter of time until you begin to get agitated. Character development and a cliché'd narrative doesn't help a lot either, and further drags the film into it's failures.",2,13,33,29 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Go and watch The Evil Dead instead!
","If you want cheap scares, bulgy and jagged dialogue or bad continuity then go and see Drag me to Hell. It has all of these aspects and nearly ruins the film experience, so get out before the end!. Riami who, is the director of some of the best Superhero film franchises to date such as Spiderman sinks into the ground with his supposed 'return to true horror' film Drag me to Hell.Now, if ever thinking of comparing this to his earlier classics- The Evil Dead trilogy, then by all means do so, but you will be hugely disappointed. The comedy aspect for example isn't all that clear and You don't know weather to laugh or just keep your mouth shut, and Riami does this throughout the film, as if teasing the audience. The characters are dull and generic Hollywood actors who are starring in a crappy horror film. The two main leads seem only one dimension at most times and don't reveal another side to any of them, which will bore the audience. The dialogue is poorly connected from line to line and feels as if the actors are making them up on the spot, but the continuity is the worst. For the endurance of the film the continuity is awful and makes out to be very amateur.",5,0,3,9 July 2009
Saw," One of a Kind
","Saw IS the best horror film and one of the best films i've seen in recent memory. It definitely claims it's place as being scary, sadistic, terrifying and utterly compelling. Everything exceeded beyond expectation and far beyond any horror film in the last 10 years. Saw is one of a kind, great and visceral, entertaining and horrific. It's impact will linger with you for years to come, and so it should. The brilliance and psychological effect both work brilliantly, as does the acting, directing and a totally original story.The detailed and initial depth of plot and character all work perfectly, as does with the twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end.",10,1,3,28 April 2008
The Last Samurai," A solid movie
","The Last Samurai is a great film, its thoughtful, engaging, dramatic, adventurous and contains powerhouse performances by both Tom Cruise and Ken Watanebe. Set in Japan 1870 The Last Samurai tells the story of Captain Nathen Algren, a veteran of the American Civil War who is asked to train the Emperors men in order to defeat the las of the Samurai. Algrens engrossing passion is swayed when he is caught and held prisoner by the Samurai. When captured though, his passions and ideas are changed by what he sees and then decides to learn of their culture and traditions.The Last Samurai is thoughtful, engaging and totally original. The acting stands above others and its story is brilliantly for shown. Director Ed Zwick has produced a film rare with beauty and style that one could only sit back and admire.",8,0,1,23 August 2008
Rocky," Go the Distance!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Certainly the best boxing film i have ever witnessed, pouring out a very good heart warming story, nice and interesting characters that you can never get bored of and a strong emotional flow as the film progresses.This is a true and visual 20th century Gladiator movie, fighting for what is right. It's the quite sleeper of 1976, but created masses of critical attraction, which well deservingly paid off for a bold and emotional drama about one mans rise to stardom, i.e. Sylvester Stallone and the character he plays in the film - ROCKY.It is certainly true, that Rocky was born and bred in three and a half days, with Stallone pending the script and his then wife typing it up. Which reverses the phrase 'slow and steady wins the race' Despite being written and typed in the 3 and a half days, Rocky has become a movie experience not wanting to forget. Leaving you feeling 'wow, what an achievement'",10,1,1,30 August 2007
Inside Man," An excellent heist movie with many great thrills
","Inside Man in my opinion nearly touches the greatness of other brilliant crime/heist movies like Heat. It delivers great dialogue a neat story and thrills to keep you guessing right to the closing credits. Not to forget an excessively good cast like Denzel Washington, Christopher Plummer, Willem Defoe, Cive Owen and Jodie Foster that also add that extra touch of brilliance to a well crafted and balanced film. Inside Man excels on all levels and beyond that most films wouldn't go near. The acting is stunning and will definitely leave you feeling like you have watched Academy Award performances from all. The story is edgy, gritty and epic. And the directing is of such high calibre that Michael Mann may even struggle to top.",8,2,3,5 August 2008
Pulp Fiction," Without a doubt, one of the most classic films ever made.
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review: Regarded as one of the greatest films in history, Pulp Fiction has redefined movie history forever. Quentin Tarantino, the master behind the epic has directed a film with a sounding beat and an uncompromising tempo. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samual L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Eric Stoltz and Rosanna Arquette all give the greatest performances of their careers.Its hard to ever forget Pulp Fiction, every substance and detail are perfected to an over perfect film. The classic and timely epic acting play one of the biggest sectors in the film. Every scene is loaded with substance and coolness from beginning to end. The story though very simple throws elements and greatness to new levels.Verdict: An unforgettable masterpiece. Coolly directed and inch perfectly acted from all members. Tarantino has landed himself as a master of the modern epic",10,0,1,21 November 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Lock Stock and 2 hours of rubbish
","I really cant see why this film is so highly rated. In my eyes it's just a complete mess and Ritchies worst film. Compared to Snatch, this has nothing on it, not even close. The other critics on this website debate that Lock Stock has a better ending and story, but i didn't really see that. The pacing of Lock Stok is astonishingly slow and the characters feel like their cardboard cutouts without a soul. This also brings a negative thrall over this poorly directed and acted mess.I cant begin to tell you how much i disliked the cast, i mean awful. The choices of picking some actors like Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Steven Mackintosh is just like picking up anyone of the street and saying they will do. It's not on. And despite not having ever heard of any of them, i wish i hadn't now.",1,23,48,31 July 2008
The Untouchables," A movie masterpiece
","Review:The Untouchables is definitely De Palms's best film to date and shows a directors true talent of genuine direction an excellent script and timelessly quotable characters.The Untouchables is about Federal Agent Elliot Ness (Costner) who sets out to take out Al Capone (Robert De Niro); because of rampant corruption, he assembles a small, hand-picked team which includes Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith.The acting is charismatic and moving, watch out for Connery's masterful and show stealing performance! The slow but edgy shots are detailed with life and bring a vibe of greatness about the film. The poetically violent action scenes also share a key attribution to the films success.The Untouchables is like an atomic bomb, everyone feels it. It's unspeakable power reigns supreme from start to end.Verdict:A poetically portrayed epic that fires all bullets accordingly.",10,0,2,5 December 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Simply stunning
","The Martix Reloaded is the second chapter in the all amazing Matrix Trilogy. It combines all the fast paced action and excitement of the first film as well as some new surprises. Though flawed by others, The Matrix Reloaded is a sequel worthy of recognition. Though nothing compared to its all blazing predecessor, Reloaded contains elements and surprises that will make audiences return from what they took away from the brilliance of the first one back into this stunning second chapter that should definitely not be looked down upon.As to say though that The Matrix Reloaded offers excellence and diversity compared to other science fiction and action films. And whats better is it takes it to a new level.",8,0,0,8 September 2008
The Departed," To state The Departed as one of the greatest films ever made is to state the obvious
","Review: The Departed is by far Martin Scorsese's greatest film to date and shows off the raw and authentic talent of a master. His direction is, in some ways, particularly in this film unmatchful. The forging of each scene is coated in such panache and style that you could easily say that Scorsese has outdone himself. The dialogue and realism of the characters is un-believably well done. To take huge Hollywood stars like Di Caprio, Damon, Nicholson and Wahlburg and combine them into one lasting film is brilliant on it's own ground. The acting is rock hard to the end, and doesn't slip up. No pauses or one-off's, just firm all the way.Verdict:A compromising and memorable picture that one could re-watch time after time. This is pure cinema.",10,1,4,6 February 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," This film was the pinnacle of fun!
","transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a hands down classic and is the loudest and most brilliant Summer blockbuster thus far. The action is riveting and extremely fast paced and stops for nothing at all. From start to finish the film places you on a roller-coaster ride that is going at one thousand miles per hour and doesn't let up along the way. The film, instead unleashes more furiously paced and visually unimaginable action as the film progresses. And Michael Bay proves once again that he is the master of blowing stuff up! Every action scene is crafted in such detail that it'l be hard to imagine a better action director working today, and with the help of Spielburg as executive producer, what could go wrong? The cast are rock solid and prove to be one of the main driving forces of the movie. The direction has also been shaped into a more powerful and bold force compared to the last one and helps Bay create a more intense and fun experience for the audience.All in all, Revenge of The Fallen is a hands down classic and damn right thrilling action adventure unlike you have ever seen before.",3,13,29,19 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Genienly Spectacular
","First thing is first. This is classic Speilburg. If you want an emotional, exciting, jaw-dropping and nerve racking experience and one that will stick with you, go and see this film. It has everything a blockbuster should have to en thrill it's audience- action, adventure, suspense and drama. All inhaled into two hours of fun. The choice of the lead act is vital in many different films. Fistly so that the actor can sit into his character and give real depth and persona and secondly to help the audience appreciate what the certain character has/ is going through in a film. Steven Spielberg has not gone wrong here or with the supporting acts and they all pay off exceedingly well.By no means the best Spielberg film, but by so many means a perfect Summer blockbuster.",10,2,6,1 June 2008
Man on Fire," absolutely brilliant!!!!!
","Tony Scott has created a dynamic masterpiece with his 2004 film Man on Fire which was released on 8th October and made $23 million dollars on its opening weekend. Starring Academy award winner Denzel Washington, who plays a burnt out ex CIA operative/assassin, but later his friend Rayburn (academy award winner) Christopher Walken brings him to Mexico City, to be a bodyguard to 9 year old Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) who is the daughter of an industrialist Samual Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy accepts the assignment as he has nothing better to do. Pita manages to make Creasy smile again as he spends more time protecting her, and manage to become close friends.This all seems fine, but when Pita is kidnapped during a shoot out, although wounded, Creasy swears revenge on all those who are involved. This takes him on a rampage of destruction, this all pays of with great violence e.g. tying a guys hand to a steering wheel and cutting his fingers off one by one without regret, another example is putting a c4 bomb up a guys arse and getting to see him get blown up, its pretty terrifying, but at the same time brilliant.Overall a top class piece of film, superbly acted and passionately written, this can not be mist because of the gruesome violence and electrifying story line.",8,1,3,13 May 2007
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Intriguing, brilliant and funny- why this film is one of the greatest cinematic achievements
","Nichilson gives it his all, in this hard hitting, gripping emotional drama set within a mental institute. Winner of 5 academy awards- Best actor in a leading role, Best actress in a leading role, Best Director, Best picture and Best screenplay. And this has only ever been achieved twice. The other being The Silence Of The Lambs in 1991. After reading some reviews on the internet about this much acclaimed film, i sat down with my three brothers and watched one of the greatest films in living film memory. After watching the film i couldn't believe how great and sad it was, funny and compelling in all ways. And i could definitely understand why people cried, because it is emotional. The characters who do have mental disabilities all make you understand how hard and frustrating it is.The end was very very sad and hard hitting. Milos Forman has done an exceptional job in creating the atmosphere and situations the people in the film face.To summarise my view, One flew over the Cuckoos nest is stupendous and brilliant, cunning and sad, funny and clever. This can't be mist by anyone.",10,1,2,26 July 2007
American Gangster," The nerve to be EPIC
","Firstly, this isn't an action movie. It's a Hollywood masterpiece. One that Ridley Scott can be very proud of. It's almost as if the Godfather had been redone for audiences of the 21st Century. The main effects and motives of this story are: The acting- Sheer, brilliant and incomparable, this is a pairing and a half. The two actors are dazzling and flawless. Both Crow and Washington deserve Oscars for this.The story- This, also is sensational. The pace and timing of it can't be bettered. The excitement of every new scene is a joy to watch.Directoin- Can't be better, Scott has proved he can do a Gangster film, and pull it off in flair and style.So, if looking for a good enjoyable film that carries a very descent story, successive acting and direction to take your breath away, look no further than the new Godfather-American GANGSTER!",10,1,4,25 January 2008
The Green Mile," The reason why films were invented!!!!!!!
","The Green Mile is a perfect and all round excellent film. The acting is simply damn good emotional, the direction is ecstatic and full of wonderful camera shots and a story that one could only admire with great belief and the fact remains that Darabont has produced a classic of epic scales and depths. The charisma and boldness of each touch to character and story is a perfect blend and shows a director at full working power. Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) delivers an outstanding performance that both uplifts as well as charms.The story is set in non- chronological order which gives the depth of the film more purpose. The story follows a group of Death Row guards at a penitentiary, in the 1930's. Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) has watched men live and die on death row and so has shaken his faith and sanity. But when enters John Coffey (Clarke-Duncen) an 8 foot giant man accused of the murder and rape of two young girls Edgecomb befriends this giant man and begins to learn that he wasn't the one who committed the murder.A mystical, powerful and deeply moving film that explodes with fantastic performances and one heck of a directorial masterwork proves Frank Darabont is one of the most exciting and provisional dramatic directors of all time. The Green Mile is film that'l have you laughing, crying and admiring.",10,0,2,15 October 2008
The Wrestler," Lacking the depth and attention span which will be the concern of most viewers.
","5 stars Empire Magazine hails it, An instant Classic blasts The Times and so on but The Wrestler to me is just an irritating biographic drama movie that doesn't leave you feeling like you have watched an amazing. film. Instead though, The Wrestler is a down beat and boring film that lacks power and emotion. The main character played by Rourke is unimportant and depressing, which is what Aronofsky is aiming for. The conclusion is useless and incoherent to what real movie fans want to see.The pacing is so slow and exaggerated that, at times it lies in the falling asleep category. Also the shots are repetitive and linger in most cases in one shot which i didn't like.Overall, don't waist your money on this crap because all it does is puts you down.",3,1,8,24 May 2009
Hancock," Summer entertainment at it's best!
","Hancock is firstly, a brilliant and elegant movie. Full of laugh out loud comedy and perfect action. Secondly it gives a different vibe on the normal superhero movie, that pays off immensely well. All the actors involved in the production of Hancock give it a real dramatic and comedic endurance that lasts from beginning to end.Hancock is a boozy and sleazy superhero that the public despise due to his foul mouth and undesirable drinking problems. Hancock though, doesn't seem to care about the publics opinion about him. After saving Ray, a public relations executive from being run over by a train. He offers to help Hancock and try and fix his public image as a dept for saving his life.The story maybe simple in plot, but delivers bold and hard hitting knocks of comedy and action all the way. The comedy doesn't slip up or run down hill, even in the third act.Hancock really is pure summer entertainment.",8,5,11,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," great
","Well, what can i say the third and final movie in the Star Wars franchise takes a devastating turn towards the dark side, as we see Anikin turn into the monstrous apprentice to the Emperor Darth Vader. The story carry's on by Obi and Anikin returning from the long, ongoing clone wars, but not all is as it seams. Anikins lust for greater power grows stronger in the presence of Chancerlorr Palpatine as he tries to manipulate Anikin into turning to the Dark side, and his love for Padme. Obi One who has now turned Jedi Master is sent to look for the droid commander General Grevious as he continuous to wage war on the Jedi Council.

On a security video, Obi One witnesses the destruction and cause of death that only a dark lord can prevent.All of this leads leads to a climactic showdown with the lost but now turned Anikin in which Obi must face with great pain. Overall a great film, with great great characters and a fantastic story line, Star Wars Episode 3 really has ended the great franchise in a very positive way.",8,2,6,15 April 2007
Shooter," Falls short in the second and third act.
","Shooter stars Mark Wahlberg, Danny Glover and is directed by Antoine Fugua. Mark Wahlberg plays a marksmen who, after witnessing the death of his best friend and 'spotter' goes living in exile but is pulled back into his job after learning of an assassination attempt on the Presidant of the United States. He applies for the job, but soon later is double-crossed and framed for the attempt. He then goes on the run to track down and kill the person who set him up.The first act is by far the best in the film and as usual it sets the tone and pacing of the rest of the film. After an impressive first act i was hoping for this to be sustained or get better, but sadly it doesn't. Instead it lacks all the greatness that the first act gave us and piles up a slow and steady decline of poor pacing, acting and not enough action.After having high hopes of seeing a great film full of thrills, good acting, explosions and excitement i was greatly disappointed.",5,1,2,19 August 2008
Defiance," Shallow acting and prolonged story telling all feel's second hand.
","Review:Defiance is a some what mis-shaped and indecent world war 2 drama that really doesn't do itself any justice. A film which is directed by Ed (Blood Diamond) Zwick usually is worth the watch for, but all Defiance does is give you a bad feel of urgency waiting to be told and directed professionally.The cast which includes Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell should prepare audiences for a well acted and boldly moving film that one wouldn't want to leave the cinema to quickly to miss. Unfortunately their performances and bonding chemistry on-screen goes down a bad and rough path that ends up with the audience feeling deprived and persuaded into watch 2 hours and 17 minutes of ill-treated acting.The pacing is definitely an issue which further spirals the film down into the mud. Zwick knows how to direct, but the pacing that we saw in Blood Diamond or The Last Samurai is completely the opposite to in Defiance.Verdict:Zwicks failure as a director gives a taste for a failing film that doesn't characterise the characters efficiently nor the story properly. Instead your felt like it's all second hand.",4,8,18,10 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Brilliant!
","Sherlock Holmes is a brilliant, action packed adventure that pushes the boundaries of action movies even further. With its quick cut and no hold barrelled action, Sherlock Holmes is truly something you will be thinking about for a while after you have left the cinema. Downey Jr adds an aura of witty , sharp bladed dialogue as the London detective. His side-kick Watson adds to this already revealing chemistry of the Newman and Redford combo that surely cannot be seen as a negative thing. Although different from that that old movie magic chemistry, Law and Downey Jr fit together very well. The direction is sheer class, and can only be compared to Ritchies other masterpiece-Snatch. The cinematography touches upon techniques used rarely today by worldly directors, but Ritchie pulls it off with fine brilliance.",8,0,4,10 January 2010
Raging Bull," Truly awful. A complete Let down.
","Trust this to be a classic. You must be having a laugh. It doesn't step anywhere near that mark. Fistly Robert De Niro, what the hell went wrong their. Whne i watched it all his dialogue was mumbled and very, very hard to understand. I will admit, okay some of his acting talents were okay emotionally. The supporting actor Joe Pesci also like Robert De Niro's acting-some good but most bad. And i know that the film was released in black and white because of the mood and atmosphere of the film, but it lingers far too long. Finally the directing was class c from Martin Scorsese and most probably his worst film. The boxing scenes are meant to be in your face-bold, long, bloody and violent. Instead most of them are at least 30 seconds to a minute long, its pathetic. Even the final championship fight was only something like 30 seconds. It really does put a shame around Raging Bull and especially De Niro. Too right, Rocky's better than Raging Bull......... 'Go the Distance' Well at least Rocky tried and greatly succeeded, whereas in my opinion Raging Bull is just a forgettable mess of cinema.",2,3,19,27 April 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Chilling.
","Review:The Silence of The Lambs is easily one of the greatest films of all time. From it's eerie and atmospheric opening Lambs grabs you and doesn't let go. It's plot is riveting, it's characters unique, it's direction is remarkable and it's acting is top notch. Hopkins character is by far one of the most intriguing and psychotic to have ever been portrayed on film. From the demonic looks to the glaring and unblinking eyes, Hopkins has crafted a menacing and deranged character that only will stand as being one of the greatest roles. The first time we encounter this psycho is in the dark bowels of the asylum, where Hopkins conveys an aura of pure insanity and evil by doing nothing but just standing in the middle of the cell.Lambs is an excellent and taught thriller that boasts great performances as well as an A* worked direction from Demme who works this first rate classic like a symphony orchestra. Demme creates visual style and symbolic substance that take movies and especially thrillers to a new level.Verdict:Scary as hell and thrilling in equal quantities. And a pure acting sensation for Hopkins and Foster.",10,1,1,26 October 2008
Iron Man," Funny, adventurous and full of fun- the summer is here!
","Firstly to state that i am not an Iron Man comic fan and haven't read any of the comics. But be sure that the film does it complete justice. People have been asking if this film really does contain a wonderful cast, and i admirably say yes. Yet this is only one of the bold excitements contained in this fun filled film. Looking back at some of the other Marvel adaptations from previous years, like Spiderman, The Fantastic Four, Batman and others. Iron Man is by a mile one of the best.Other ingredients apart from a solid gold Marvel adaption is, the cast, screenplay, drama, comedy, action and adventure. But the most significant and standing out aspect of Iron Man is undoubtedly the cast. Which is, in my view Robert Downey Jr's remember-able alongside Zodiac. But lets not also forget the other supporting cast, who also give the film admiration and emotion- Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrance Howard.Yet apart from the dream-filled casting, people are still bundled with a mass amount of real excitement, action and drama. Which is consistent all throughout the film, and doesn't let up anywhere. Honestly, this is how movies should be made, with audiences feeling excitement at every turn.Pure cinematic pleasure!",10,1,4,3 May 2008
Blade Runner," In a class of it's own.
","Blade Runner is the defining example of a excellent sci-fi film. It has everything, and although i am not a vivid fan of the genre i certainly became more interested after the thrilling adventure of watching Blade Runner. Ridley Scott, director of classic such as Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven and American Gangster has created an impossible but brilliant alternative universe that one can be washed away to. It leave's you spellbound and amazed. Scott has created a masterpiece of epic proportion but without all the blazing gun fights and modern Hollywood crap that audiences see today. Instead Scott has created worlds packed with life and soul in it. The directing is Scott's main strong point's and show's a true master working at the top of his game. Each scene flows swiftly and maintains a balance to it.",10,8,23,15 April 2008
Casino Royale," Very Very good
","Band returns, in the best one yet. With all action, adventure and suspense throughout. After Peirce Brosnans departure after Die Another Day. You could only look for a great, fine actor, and found it in Daniel Craig. This Bond was recreating the brutal violence that was lost in the other films, and to expand the story further and resolving around Bond before and during he becomes a 00.Martin Camball, here returns to direct Casino Royale, and lastly directed the first Peirce Brosnan 007 outing in Goldeneye. And has extended and better improved the James Bond saga today. With it's moments of intense and graphic realistic violence, Bond travels along way, and succeeding stupendously.

The Deer Hunter," A solid masterpiece. Cinimo and De Niro are Gods
","Review: The Deer Hunter is a straight foreword masterpiece and is among one of the best movies ever made. The performance's are often brilliant as is Cinimo's type of directing. It's bold and often daring, but Cinimo pull's it off and delivers a powerful ballad of film-making.Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken both play their characters to an extent that you could almost feel like you could fully connect with them, and Cinimo has conquered this exuberantly well. Especially De Niro who gives his best performance yet as the warm-hearted Mike. The bondage between individual characters is sublime and powerful.Cinimo moves the camera from scene to scene like a painting; beautifully illustrated and detailed to the point of near greatness.The music is immensely bold and chilling every time it's being played and adds a certain depth and movement in the characterisation of the characters.Verdict: A god among any film about Vietnam and definitely provides a strong-held suggestion of being one of the great's of cinema.",10,1,3,22 December 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," SO Awful!
","Die Hard 4.0 OR Live Free Die hard is not your typical Bruce Willis action movie. It more like comes across as a dull uncompromising and very unsuccessful fourth film of a great well deserved trilogy. But Len Wisemen (Underworld) had to go and bugger it all out of proportion. Tis meaning <ul><li>bad acting - slow, very unfurled action - rubbish storyline/plot - The casting for certain roles were awful. </li></ul>So reality wise, don't even think or attempt to see this or buy it on DVD.

The Sixth Sense," Simply put, one of the greatest films ever made.
","Review: If ever there was a film so terrifying, so perfected, so spine-tingling and so awe-inspiring in the world today then i don't think there could be any other like this in it's class, and The sixth Sense is that film. To state this movie as a masterpiece is stating the obvious, but The Sixth Sense is so much more than mastery. It's a carefully perfected and orchestrated phenomenon of a film that will touch every nerve in your body and will shake you to the very core.M. Night Shyamalan, the work and brains of this unique film has created a film that is bound to live in our memories for ever.Verdict: A powerful and spine-nerching horror thriller that should rightly take it's place among the greatest films.",10,1,2,19 January 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A film full of brilliance, flair, luminosity and beyond the vivid intensity of the previous two.
","This film is the true first epic for the 21th Century and most probably the unbeatable for a very long time. The film is incomparable to the last two. Going a step further and passing audiences expectations throughout it's world wide release. It became a betterment for films today, because of its vividly enhanced and well founded characters including the credible and uncompromisingly harrowing visual effects, that even Tolkien would surpass today.The directors vision has finally been realised, Jacksons dominant role of being one of the greatest directors have come swiftly and within the day count from six years ago, Peter Jackson released a competence of pure ignition and fuel powered, emotional, gratifying and extravagant film.",10,1,3,15 September 2007
Casino," Scorsese Scores again
","Pure style and flair demonstrates that a dream paring with Martin Scorsese really can be the highlight of your life. Robert De Niro, once again proves that he is a masterful actor, right up their with Marlon Brando. Anyway the film Casino, is a dark thriller where De Niro plays a casino owner. It shows the rise and fall of his character, the up's and downs of his relationship with Sharon Stone and the downfall with his best friend played unforgettably by Joe Pesci. Acting- sheer class, moving and majestic.Directing- Can't be bettered by anyone doing a mobster film Story- charismatic and undeniably thrilling.There's nothing else to say apart from, that this is another classic by Scorsese and one that should stand the tide of other gangster films.",4,2,4,27 January 2008
Heat," Pacino and De Niro face off!!!!!!!!!!!
","This was a truly amazing film, with great dynamic intriguing acting to grip the audiences attention. Michael Mann has done a fantastic job upon the directorial side, assembling a great cast, this all pays of with a great film. De Niro and Pacinos first clash together on a film is superb. The hunter (pacino) is chasing the hunted (De Niro.) Niel Mcauley (De Niro) is a thief on the loose, and Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is the one to stop him. This epic chase puts Hannas family at risk. But none the less this is a true crime/cop thriller, which is right up there with the best of them including Dirty Harry and others. It contains dynamic shoot outs, great supportive acting from the likes of Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and John Voight, but all in all a truly great film, this is just a tad of perfection, but still none the less an awesome film!!!!!!!!!!",9,1,3,19 May 2007

Nominated for best picture of 1977 and winner for the best visual effects comes the adventure of a lifetime.

","It has smashed the box offices in America, with a domestic income of 70 million on its first weekend, not bad for a budget of 65 million!!! And has created worldwide success. With its all round positive criticism from critics from around the world. This surely wouldn't of been possible if it didn't have a great director to lead the cast, Zach Snyder who is currently setting out to film the Watchman, has directed a cast of great power and enthusiasm to show that sword and sandal epics can be made to be great. With its great cast, that include Gerard Butler and Lena Headey. The battles make Pellenour Feilds look like flower fields simply because of the unique brutality and the way every battle looks carefully and superbly put together for the ultimate battles you will see in a long time.",8,3,9,17 March 2007
The Great Escape," It doesn't provide the greatness it could have
","*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review:The Great Escape is a blatant and obvious Steve McQueen war film that doesn't punch all the punches correctly. The tedious and untimely draw-backs to McQueen visiting his detention cell just get more boring and frustrating as you watch. The never ending and pointless 'walk about' around the concentration camp scenes become tiresome and forgetful. Although 'Escape' is layered with world-renowned actors, it still is placed with an of form Steve McQueen and blabby acting.Director John Sturges tries to layer all this substance that doesn't work and by the end you feel like he's committed a common and severe crime that you wonder and ask yourselves- why put me through this'?Verdict:Despite the backup of some great actors (excluding McQueen) you can only help but beg for mercy for it to end.*Tragic",1,12,42,16 November 2008
Pineapple Express," Comedy Gold
","Review: Deemed by Empire magazine as one of the best comedy's of the year, Pineapple Express is a laugh out loud comedy that strains no sweat and delivers a comedy that will be endured by so many in the future. Not only is Pineapple Express an outrageous and side-splitting comedy about a pare of on the loose drug partners, but clearly shows the power and brilliance of talent at its peak.Franco clearly steals the show in what should be remembered as one of the greatest screen performances of cinema. Every gag and increasingly silly moment leads to another, which never runs out.Verdict: A brilliant comedy and one of the greatest films ever made.",10,2,6,13 September 2008
Gangs of New York," personal and Bloody
","An in-depth analysis of war, people and the consequences. Revealing the brutality and control over the 5 points, and delivering spellbinding characters and story. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis and Cameron Diaz and directed by academy award winning director- Martin Scorsese.This could of been given a 10, BUT, it's boring and uninteresting in places, but if its Martin Scorsese you know your in for a treat and full on brutal violence. But he's such a good director.Overall a very good well depth version of rough sided New York in the 1860's. And worth watching, but not for the faint hearted who are not into violence.",8,0,2,20 August 2007
Moon," A new breed of science fiction
","Moon is, at last a sci-fi movie that is one of the best of this decade. The twists and turns keep you guessing right up until the very last minute, and when it comes you are knocked for six. Awesome scenery help establish the mood and ambiguity of the whole film, and makes the viewer feel uncomfortable and uneasy at the most eerie scenes in the film. With the help of great direction and music that is from a bygone age, it's hard to imagine Moon to not be a likely contender for one of the best films of the year. The lack of an ensemble cast really helps drive the film forewords and it's because of this that, at the most suspenseful of times, becomes harrowing and very bleak.",9,0,2,29 December 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millionaire is a triumph
","Review: A brilliant up-beat film that resounds colour and depth in all areas. Danny Boyle has created a multicultural phenomenon that will surely grab a few Oscars in February. The direction throughout the film is timelessly enjoyable and shows a real master at work. To add to this greatness comes the acting and story, which both are brilliantly rendered and manufactured.The pulse of the film is up-beat, which carries the film along a secure and thrilling journey in which everybody can enjoy. Okay it is emotional but in a an area that say's in a good way.Verdict: A stylish and compulsive film that delivers the good's and one that will certainly leave you smiling when the credit's roll.",10,1,5,4 January 2009
Gladiator," Emotional, exciting and exceptionally well made.
","*****Classic ****Excellant ***Good **Fair *TragicReview: Galdiator is considered by many to be one of th best films to have ever been put to screen and i couldn't disagree a slight bit. The dialogue is poetic and captivating. Crowe gives audiences a taste of his power that is both thrilling and emotional.The opening battle scene, visceral, blood-filled and rough, set the tone for the rest of the movie. Hand to hand combat, a deluge of catapults firing huge fire-filled rocks at surrounding trees and chaos screeching rapidly whilst men are slaughtered brutally to the ground. Scott puts us right in the thick of battle. He doesn't want the audience to feel left out or downed by not seeing enough, so he shows us everything, from Arms to legs and even heads being mutilated right in front of your eyes.This sequence is one of the many gruelling epic battle sets to follow that punctuate the story of the main character.The plot is fast and thickened to maximum quality. Scott layers the plot so thick that it will be hard not to like. The genius of the editing makes the story and action fast and flowing without leaving anything out.The ensemble cast includes Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Djimon Hounsou who all provide as much granger and stability as Crowe in the lead role.Verdict: Gladiator is a must-see classic that swells up bold moves by recreating the lost sword and sandal epics that had previously been failing for the past 30 years. But Gladiator hit's not only a revisionary insight into the power of a sword and sandal epic but delivers an emotional impact with it's story and character.",10,2,3,26 October 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Words cant describe
","The Last Crusade firstly, nearly is on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark and secondly it is pure Indiana Jones excitement. All the great elements from the past two Indiana Jones films are delved into an epic third instalment of the franchise. By many people, Last Crusade will be considered the funniest of the trilogy. But it is both Connery and Ford that carry the over the top excitement and in-deniable funniness that makes the film both memorable and funny on both levels. Speilburg is considered one of the greatest directors ever lived, and he vividly proves so in this film alone that he can direct majestically. Harrison Ford has never been better as in a Indiana Jones film, and he certainly doesn't look any different from the fist one. By all means, Indiana Jones is back and better than ever, delivering the hype and brilliance of one of the greatest cinema characters of all time.",10,0,1,30 May 2008
Goodfellas," Chilling and surreal!
","Goodfellas isn't your average gangster movie for starters, instead Goodfellas wander's into film history and will be remembered as one of the finest film's ever created. Scorsese has stepped back into his gangster stepping shoe's and has devised a movie so perfectly acted, directed and classy that it'l be a hard decision to name the best gangster movie ever amounted. For Scorsese, this was a simple task and one which he had visited before (Mean Streets), and so was familiar with the history of the period and the style e.t.c.Scorsese excels in the technical aspect in Goodfellas. Wheather it be using flash cuts, freeze frames, crash zooms or montages, Scorsese has it all there and put's it to brilliant use. De Niro is excellent as is Ray Liotta and not forgetting Joe Pesci who suits his character effortlessly.",10,0,0,25 July 2009
Evil Dead II," One of the most exciting, all out hilarious and damn right retarded films of all time!!!!
","Evil Dead 2 is one of the best films ever made. The reason's mainly are because of a certain classic chemistry between Sam Raimi and Bruce Campball, the retarded but very excellent direction, the class horror/comedy element, a laughing moose head, a retarded hand that fights back and the over the top story. Bruce Campball plays Ash - the sole survivor of the original 'Evil Dead' returns with his girlfriend Linda to the remote cabin in the woods. Ash then finds a tape recorder that a professor has used to record incarnations from the Book of the Dead. When turned on the recorder releases a dark and horrific force from the surrounding woods.A very funny horror comedy with real heart. It takes nothing seriously and everything deliberately. Empire magazine quotes- 'Sam and Bruce are Gods' and damn they right about that.",10,3,4,19 October 2008
Up in the Air," A remarkable film
","Up in the Air can be described as a wonderful, emotional and eye-opening film that hits you with humour as well as emotion and can profoundly be remarked as one of the years best films. Am i talking Oscars? Certainly. With this much charisma and cinematic brilliance, Up in the Air has the potential to win in the major groups such as 'Best Picture, 'Best Director' and most certainly 'Best Actor'. Here George Clooney plays his part of Ryan Bingham to perfection. Clooney resonates power as well as charm in a role that will, without doubt, be treasured for a while. Up in the Air has everything going for it, so i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't win at least the major statuettes.",10,2,7,3 January 2010
V for Vendetta," Good in places but lacks the momentum to keep going
","Review:V for Vendetta takes place in the not-too-distant future, Britain has become a fascist, totalitarian state, its population cowed and apathetic. But the nation receives a wake-up call when mysterious masked terrorist 'V' (Weaving) blows up the Old Bailey and calls for the citizens to rise up against their oppressors.The most likely aspect of the film is 'V', a character hellbent on bringing Britain to it's knee's and then to create a new peace that hadn't been seen since Britain has currently become a totalitarian state.Weaving brings leaps and bounds of life to the lead character, who in awe is the show stealer of the film.Despite the characterisation of 'V', the rest is clearly average. The main hold-back is the pace of the momentum that the film considerably lacks in. The first half an hour starts out as a 5 star action thriller but slowly degrades into a murky mess of keeping what we saw in the first half an hour down to an average three star action thriller.Verdict: For what was a 5 star classic in the first thirty minutes soon rapidly switches to a three star action thriller due to keeping the pacing and momentum up.",6,3,5,21 December 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," More fun than a dozen movies put together!
","O brother where art thou is a funny, exciting, at times emotional and all out comedy adventure of three escaped convicts in search of treasure, whilst being pursued by lawmen. It is tightly based on Homers The Odyssey and takes place in the deep south during the 1930's. George Clooney plays Everett, a man of big ideas but no real sense. John Turtorro plays Pete and Tim Black Nelson plays Delmar.Why i say this is an instant classic is the adventure comedy aspect. Both pay of tremendously well all throughout the film. I cant think of any other bunch of talented actors who could up-hold the funniness like Clooney, Turtorro and Nelson could.All in all a timeless and epic achievement that one could be happy enough to watch over and over.",10,0,1,2 July 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Awful and not funny
","People say, that this film is awesome. That it's very funny and that it's so good, but i see the complete opposite to that, it's ridiculously awful and that it's not funny or even entertaining. The story is the same all the way through, but just added a little flavour to make the story funny. In my opinion, it's most probably Will Ferrals worst performance to date and even Anchorman is funnier, but this makes all comedy's look dull, not funny and absolutely stupid. Sacha Baron Cohen makes a half descent effort but still cant pull of genuine comedy.It's actually more of a film you would mock than laugh with. The races are about the only exciting moment to remember this film for. The story never goes down twisty or unknown paths, that could make it a bit more bold but never attempts to.",1,1,3,9 September 2007
The Godfather," The Greatest gangster film EVER!!!!!!!
","Well what can i say? A great cast, a great director and a great film. This surely has to be one of my all time greats, beautifully acted and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in a sense that its almost ubelievable to believe that a director could achieve this. The cast line up includes Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and Diana Keaton. Marlon Brando gives an extraordinary performance as Don Voto Corleone aka the Godfather. With its breath taking story line and emotional story telling and a stellar cast.What more can you ask for this emotionally gritty drama. And the answer is nothing, because this is to as near perfect film making you are going to see. Don't MISS ME",10,3,6,3 March 2007
