Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent follow up to volume one
","In Kill Bill Vol 2. Tarantino has focused more into storyline, characters and plot and given a little rest to the blood and gore of the first one. Making this one stand out and in my opinion surpass the first one. Once again the story picks up where part one left off, The Bride is still thirsty for revenge and has three more people to finish off, leaving last on the list, the most crucial of them all, Bill.This time around, the movie follows a more spaghetti westernish path, and leaves the chop-socky, kung fu tributes a little bit behind. That's mostly in part because the targets are different and now most of the action takes place in American soil. This time we also finally learn The Bride's real name. Next on her list, is the white-trashy, trailer-dwelling brother of Bill's, Budd, played excellently by Michael Madsen, in his best role since Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs. Budd is the only male member of Bill's killer squad. This time around we also find out why Budd is living the kind of life that he is, and are even taken on a little trip to his workplace to really see what his life has become after leaving the squad. This time around we also learn how The Bride learned to kick ass the way she does, by seeing her taking a trip down memory lane while she's in a sticky situation of life and death and for about twenty minutes or so, we go back to the kung-fu, chop-socky tribute, and meet a new character in time, Pai Mei played by legendary kung fu actor Gordon Liu. We also see in action for the first time, the other member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and only worthy match to The Bride, Elle Driver played by the still beautiful Daryll Hannah. Seeing Elle and The Bride's fight on screen is one of the best seen in recent Hollywood movies but the best part of the movie comes when The Bride finally finds Bill.I have to say, even for a role that was written specifically for him and that has somewhat to do with his earlier work, David Carradine still does an excellent job playing Bill. His charisma and coolness make him a natural at this kind of role. And speaking of coolness, one of my favorite actors, Sam Jackson, also makes a very brief appearance at the beginning of the movie that goes almost unnoticed, but as always he's great even if it's in a teeny little cameo. This movie, in true Tarantino style, is filled with great dialogue, in my opinion, the greatest since Pulp Fiction. Also, once again Tarantino chooses the perfect music for his work. The spaghetti-western music from classic films also blend with the movie perfectly. In conclusion, this movie delivers in all levels, action-wise, comedy-wise, story-wise, and dialogue-wise. So there is something for everyone in this movie. This one, along with volume one, make their mark as one of the first classics of the 21st century. 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,6 March 2005
Scarface," A timeless tale of an underdog who reached the top
","'Scarface' is the story of a Cuban immigrant who arrives in the US through a boat sent by Fidel Castro himself to purposely send all of his criminals to American soil and crap on Uncle Sam. His name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) Upon Tony's arrival in America, he is already spotted as a potential threat and is interrogated by customs agents who find out a little bit of his history and decide to send him to a special camp where all Cuban undesirables are sent. Some time later, opportunity knocks in the form of murdering a Cuban general, sent to prison by Fidel himself, who tortured and killed govt. officials back in Cuba and now one of those official's brother, who is a powerful man in Miami, wants him dead. Tony, his best friend Manolo (Steven Bauer), and a few other friends carry out this task and earn themselves a Green Card. But this is only the beginning....This powerful man, turns out to be Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) a wealthy Miami drug lord whom Tony ends up working for. Frank Lopez's right hand man is Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) a guy who does not like Tony Montana's determination and attitude and calls him derogatory names like 'peasant' and 'dish washer' but Tony is not exactly crazy about him either. We also meet Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio) a beautiful 19-year old for whom Manolo falls for, but Tony does not want Manolo anywhere near his sister, because is the only pure untouched thing in his life and does not want her to be corrupted by his world, but eventually this does happen. Later on, Tony falls head over heels for Frank's sexy, young wife Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) who despite her beauty and wealth, is always miserable and does nothing but snort coke all day and never cracks a single smile. Tony starts making the moves on Elvira, until later on in the movie, snatches her away from Frank, but not before removing Frank from the map, but that comes later. During one of Tony's business trips we meet yet another character, The ruthless and even more powerful drug kingpin, Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) a Bolivian landowner who has a drug empire that stretches all across South America. Tony does his best, at first to impress this new acquaintance, and when Sosa questions him about his loyalty, Tony is quick to assure Sosa that he is also someone not to be messed with and is a man of his word. When Tony reaches the top and is now more powerful than his boss, Frank, ever was. Manolo, Tony's right hand man begins to take care of Tony's finances, but, in Tony's words, Manolo cares more about women than business and therefore, does not trust him completely when it comes to money.During the almost three hours of the movie we get to see Tony's rise and then, after a hot-tempered decision, his imminent fall. Scarface is a story of not only an underdog who works his way up until he reaches the 'American dream', but of the consequences of living in the fast lane. Like one of the songs from the movie soundtrack talks about 'Push it to the Limit' which, thanks to this movie, is now a classic.Yes, this movie nowadays is idolized by pop culture and by rappers and gangsters all over the world. But the question is why a movie who did not do too well at the box office at the time of its release is more popular now than it was two decades ago?. Because the story and the message behind it is timeless. Perhaps because back in the early 80's people were not ready for an in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is movie about something that is very real nowadays, drug trafficking, and for the standards of the time, the movie was very graphic. That perhaps, drove some moviegoers away and is maybe the reason why it was so panned by critics back then. But now, times are different and perhaps this movie speaks to the generation of today, who are more aware that these things are happening out there, or perhaps, because it sends out the same message their favorite hip-hop artists often talk about, which is making it to the top and earning respect through having balls and determination like Tony had. Yes, some people see it as a movie that glorifies crime and drugs and easy money. But the movie really has a deeper message. No one stays on top of the world forever. The world was his, yes, but not for long. In a few words..one of the best crime-drama movies of all time.",10,1,2,6 November 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest movie ever!
","Borat, has to be one of those films where I literally couldn't stop laughing and where I laughed so hard, tears constantly streamed down my face. If a movie can make me laugh that hard, then damn it must be a funny movie. Borat stars Sacha Baron Cohen in his first mainstream feature film, where he pretends to be a journalist from Kazakhstan. Borat is sent by the govt. of the glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, along with his assistant and friend Azamat (Ken Davidian) to do an investigative report on the American culture, but is later distracted from his mission when he discovers on TV the most beautiful woman he's ever laid eyes on..Pamela Anderson on Baywatch..this motivates Borat to instead, go on a cross country trip in order to meet, and according to him, marry Pamela Anderson, whom he believes is a virgin. The movie is like a reality show (think Jackass) except with a lot more creativity and comic genius from Baron Cohen. The way he preys on those unsuspecting Americans is just to die for. Some people might say the movie is anti-Semitic, misogynistic, racist, sexist, blah, blah, blah. But what the movie truly shows is just a mirror for American people to look at themselves at. The stuff in this movie is shocking, and not just the stuff coming from Baron Cohen and company, but also from some of his victims as well. I say if you're a person who gets easily offended, especially if you're Jewish or from the glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, don't go see this movie, but if you have an open mind and want to laugh your ass off with a movie like you haven't with any other movie in your life, then you're ready for 'Borat'. An instant classic! 10 out of 10.",10,1,17,10 November 2006
Crash," Should've done way better at the box office
","I can't believe this masterpiece only made 9 million this week at the box office. I guess most people prefer to see crap like House of Wax over this. Anyway on to the movie. I thought this movie was one of the deepest, and most compelling dramas in a long time. The movie explores the struggles of different people of different racial groups and backgrounds in a single day in Los Angeles. The movie highlights especially all the prejudices that these several groups have against one another and the way some members of a particular race are viewed by members of another race. This movie, although somewhat offensive to some viewers, rings very true to a lot of us and dares to explore the prejudices that are present in almost every average American today, but the movie also shows us that although most everyday people might be prejudiced or a bit racist to some extent, in the end we're all humans and in the end the human compassion and heart overcomes racial prejudice. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges does a very impressive job in this movie and shows he takes acting seriously and that he is very dedicated. The rest of the cast is excellent, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillipe, Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser to name the familiar faces do a superb job in this film. The virtually unknown actors like Michael Peña (Latino locksmith) Shaun Toub (Persian store owner) and Bahar Soomekh (Persian Store owner's daughter) do an excellent job as well. This movie is definitely worth your ten bucks and two hours of your life. Ten out of ten.",10,2,11,11 May 2005
Nacho Libre," Silly but tons of fun to watch
","I saw this movie last night and I must say that this movie is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen so far this year, or that I remember seeing for a long time. Jack Black is hysterical as Ignacio ('Nacho') the cook and errand boy from a remote monastery deep in Oaxaca, Mexico, who is a good-hearted guy who only cares about the orphans at the monastery and is treated like crap by the priests there because of his poor cooking and his constant obsession with becoming a luchador, but this dream comes true when he least expects it and at the time when a gorgeous hottie nun, sister Encarnacion (Ana De La Reguera) comes into his life. Nacho teams up with a skinny thug from the street, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) who mugs people for chips, and later become tag-team partners. The whole movie, including the training sequences, the dialogue between the two, and the fight sequences are hilarious. Esqueleto pretty much steals the show at times from Nacho. The rest of the moments with the children and sister Encarnacion are funny as well. Especially the nickname of one of the children which translates as 'piggy' in English. Overall the movie is very enjoyable and your children will fall in love with Jack Black. The movie has all the fart jokes and toilet humor that children have come to love over the years, but it's still watchable and fun to enjoy with the whole family. And most importantly the movie although silly, like its main character, has a heart of gold.",9,2,6,25 June 2006
American History X," Underrated gem
","What can I say, this movie is hands down the best of 1998 and one of the best films of the decade. This movie was definitely underrated when it came out, and Edward Norton should've won an Academy Award for his tour-de-force performance, and also the director, Tony Kaye for best director.This movie tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Norton) a young man in Venice Beach, California. The story is narrated by his younger brother, Danny, played by Edward Furlong, who is following his big brother's footsteps by being part of a neo-Nazi skinhead group, and basically taking his life and future down the drain. Danny's professor, played by Avery Brooks gives him an assignment on his own big brother after he had done a previous one on Hitler, and the professor of course, rejected it.The movie goes back and forward in time through Danny's narration to highlight the events leading to Derek ending up in prison for three years, and later on the story is told from Derek's own perspective starting from the time he went to prison until he gets out. There's also a strong supporting cast here; Avery Brooks is great as Danny's professor Dr. Sweeney, Ethan Suplee does a very good job as Seth, who is close to Danny and Derek and also shares the same beliefs, Stacy Keach as Cameron, the leader of the local skinhead group, Fairuza Balk as Derek's girlfriend Stacy, and Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's mother, all do a great job in their respective roles. The movie is very gripping and it will keep you glued to your seat whether you're a fan of this genre or not, because the performances are sizzling. This is by far one of Edward Norton's best roles in his career. The movie touches on a topic not many movies dare to touch on, racism, and has strong pervasive language and some very disturbing scenes, so it's not for everyone, but it's an Oscar-worthy movie nonetheless. A rare underrated gem. Ten out of ten!",10,0,1,9 March 2005
Django Unchained," Tarantino Only Keeps Getting Better
","If you're a die-hard Tarantino fan. This is a must-see for you. If you're not, and even if you've never heard of Quentin Tarantino, you should still see this movie. While it's not a film that's 100 percent accurate in its historical accounts and it might contain a few anachronisms here and there for the super nerds out there trying to spot them out, the movie is still enjoyable from beginning to end.Jamie Foxx, as the lead character, delivers a strong, solid performance as Django, a recently freed slave, with lots of heart and a quick learner, who is out for revenge after a gang of hillbilly criminals snatched his beloved wife, tortured her and sold her to a different slave owner. Christoph Waltz, gives an unforgettable performance as King Schultz, a German bounty hunter and former dentist who partners up with Django and later assists him on his quest for vengeance. Waltz steals the show in every scene he is in, with his witty, sharp dialogue and incomparable comic timing and delivery. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the main villain Calvin Candie, gives another mesmerizing performance to add to his long resume as a cruel and racist plantation magnate. Kerry Washington also delivers as the beautiful, bilingual wife of Django, Broomhilda Von Shaft, a constant victim of humiliation and cruelty by her owner, Calvin Candie. Samuel L. Jackson gives another memorable performance to add to his very own Tarantino resume as Stephen, an outspoken and powerful house slave who is very sharp and observant and who instantly despises Django upon meeting him.There are also other names and familiar faces you will see on this film that also give good supporting performances such as Don Johnson, James Remar (playing two characters) Tom Wopat, M.C. Gainey, Jonah Hill, Michael Parks, among others. Even Tarantino himself makes a small cameo. The movie is filled with the classic Tarantino brand of superb dialogue, bloody scenes, hilarious random conversations, etc. It's everything you go to the movies for. If you want an accurate historical account of the slavery era, you will not get it from 'Django' what you will get is what you pay for, A Tarantino masterpiece full of what he does best, make great, intelligent and wildly entertaining films! Highly recommend it!",10,1,4,13 February 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill vol 1.....Tarantino's back!
","Tarantino's first movie of the new millennium is nothing short of a classic masterpiece, like all of his movies of course! This one in particular is filled to the brim with tributes to old Kung-fu chop-socky films, Japanese movies, and anime, and of course the usual pop-culture references, a staple to every Tarantino film.The movie starts off with a rather disturbing look at the main character known as The Bride played by the fabulous Uma Thurman, and the title character, who we do not see but hear his voice on this volume, Bill. Later we figure out the story is all about a woman who wants nothing but revenge on the people responsible for beating the living crap out of her on her wedding day while she was pregnant, killing everyone who was there that day, putting a bullet in her head and leaving her comatose for four years. The responsible ones, besides Bill are the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The squad members in order of appearance are Vernita Green, played by the gorgeous Vivica A. Fox, Oren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu, Elle Driver, played by Daryll Hannah and Budd, played by Michael Madsen. The Brides quest for revenge takes her all the way to the other side of the world in search of one of the members, later on returning to America and continuing her vendetta against the remainder of the squad. Yes, as you've all heard there's lots of blood and gore on this one, especially the scenes in Japan, but the movie has many laughs, some of them involving a scene of The Bride in Japan with a bartender/sword maker played by the Japanese movie legend Sonny Chiba. There's also excellent music to top it off, borrowed music of course but that makes the movie even more fun to watch as is usual in all of Tarantino's movies. There's also a very well made, and bloody anime scene in which it describes one of the member's origins.I know there will be some people that will probably trash this movie for his excessive gore and violent content, but as far as i'm concerned, this is still a masterpiece, maybe not another Pulp Fiction but worthy of being in your collection if you're a fan of Tarantino's work.",10,6,12,8 March 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Tarantino + Rodriguez = Classic
","Although it's not Tarantino's best work, this movie has to be one of the coolest movies ever in my opinion. As most people have noticed it is part gritty crime flick with witty dialogue and part popcorn horror flick. Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino really helped create a classic. George Clooney's Seth Gecko has to be one of the coolest movie characters in history, next to Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, and Harvey Keitel's Mr.White. Clooney deserved the popularity and fame he received after making this movie. The supporting cast is great too, Harvey Keitel, always excellent in any role he plays, Juliette Lewis, gorgeous and also great, Cheech Marin, playing three characters, great as well, Salma Hayek, although a short role as one of the villains, pretty good too. The snake dance, along with her role in Desperado is what really launched her into Hollywood stardom. performance-wise she only said a few lines all to George Clooney right before he kills her which I think happened too fast and me and i'm sure most men wished Tarantino could've stretched Salma's character's life a bit more. The other complaint I have is that the body count was too high and I wished at least Sex Machine and Scott could've made it, maybe he could've saved Scott from getting bitten by his own father and all those vampires towards the end. I loved how Rodriguez brought the retractable penis gun back from 'Desperado' but this time we actually see how it works. Rodriguez does a great job directing his movie, his camera work, especially in the first part of the movie is excellent. The make up, props and stunts, pretty good for a low-budget flick from 1996. It's not Oscar material, but it's still a classic in it's own right.",9,1,2,24 February 2005
Pulp Fiction," Coolest movie ever!
","What can I say...my favorite movie until I saw this one was Mortal Kombat...lol I have to admit that when I was younger and I saw this movie, I didn't think it was all that, in fact, I found it long and boring. I guess at that age, I must've been about 14, I wanted to see more action, more blood, and all that simple stuff that you're attracted to as a young teenager. Now that i'm 23, and more grown up, and actually care about the movies' plots and story lines, depending if the movie is supposed to be taken seriously, I say this movie is a masterpiece that will never be equaled by any other! Pulp Fiction is great from start to finish. Tarantino's idea of showing the movie cropped up in different episodes and have them scrambled all over the movie in the same order he wrote the script I think it's great. It shows his creative genius as a screenwriter and how he can make the movie makes sense in the end, and it's good brain candy for the viewer. Now on to the characters: Sam Jackson's Jules has to be hands down my favorite movie character of all time. His coolness is hardly matched by any other character in movie history, and it's only complimented by John Travolta's character and partner in the movie, Vincent Vega. Although Vincent Vega in my opinion is way less cool and dumber and more annoying, Travolta does a great job playing Vega. Ving Rhames as Marcellus Wallace is great as well, playing the fearsome mobster, who the entire movie revolves around. Bruce Willis is great as an aging boxer who follows his instinct and honors his blood by refusing to throw a boxing match, angering Marcellus Wallace who earlier in the movie, tried to convinced him he's washed up and should do it. Uma Thurman is perfect and sexy as Marcellus Wallace's wife Mia, and her screen time with Travolta is nothing short of Hollywood gold. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Harvey Keitel, as Winston Wolf, the man who solves 'problems' and who thinks fast, talks fast, and drives very f-'in fast so you better keep up. He is a delight to watch, especially when seen opposite Travolta's character Vincent, who in the movie tests his cool with one of his usual smart-ass comments. Keitel really commands the screen when he's on it and while he's on it steals the spotlight away from Jackson and Travolta. Quentin Tarantino, making a brief appearance as Jules friend Jimmy is pretty good too, not great but pretty good and funny as well, but I still rather see Tarantino behind the camera than in front of it. Eric Stoltz, hilarious as Lance the dope dealer, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as diner robbers Pumpkin and Hunny Bunny, great as well and everybody else, even Mad TV's Phil LaMarr in a very brief appearance as one of Vincent and Jules' victims. Every single line in this movie is worth listening to and being quoted in endless websites because the dialogue is the best in recent movie history, yes, there's lots of profanity, but that's what Tarantino wants us to see, that his characters' dialogue is just like yours and mine and they talk about the same stuff you and I talk about on our way to work and quote the same TV or movie characters you and me do. That and of course the music, every single song they play in this movie perfectly fits the mood of every scene and that's what make those songs stick in your head for days. This movie deserved all the Golden Globes, Palm D'or, and Oscars it won. A true 90's classic! 10 out of 10",10,1,3,4 March 2005
Man on Fire," This movie is on FIRE!
","Very mild spoilersThis movie was great from start to finish. First of all the acting is superb. Denzel gives one of his most powerful performances ever on screen, he truly sets the screen on fire. Cutie-pie Dakota Fanning does a great job too, that little girl is such a great actress already it freaks me out, she has the acting chops of somebody twice her age! The story is very solid, and the way he gets back at the bad guys, in this case the corrupt Mexican officials, you just have to get up out of your chair and cheer for this guy. Christopher Walken, one of the best actors ever does not disappoint either but could've been given a better role. Marc Anthony is decent, too, I mean for the kind of role he was given he did a good job, although if you're a fan of his, his character might disappoint you towards the end. The director did a pretty good job with the scenery and editing too, the Japanese-styled subtitles, the color palettes, it reminded me a lot of 'Traffic' which I also loved. Denzel's and Dakota's Spanish is pretty good too, I might add. A must-see! ten out of ten!",10,1,3,23 February 2005
Fantastic Four," Mediocre
","Let me say first of all. Whenever I go to the movie theather to see a movie of this sort based on a comic book I don't really expect to see an Oscar-Winning film, but at least a decent adaptation of the comic book. The movie, although I have little knowledge of the comic book, was weak, not because it wasn't exactly like the comic book because it is expected that a movie will always have little differences here and there for running time's sake, but this film really didn't do justice to the comic book or even to the cartoon series. However, it had its moments, with Chris 'The Human Torch' Evans, and Michael 'The Thing' Chiklis providing some laughs, but the other actors, especially the Welsh actor playing Reed Richards, are very dry and wooden. The story is not told well and the only enjoyment you can get out of this movie is the special effects and if you're a man seeing hottie Jessica Alba A.K.A.Invisible Woman on a spandex uniform. If you're looking for a Spider-man or Batman Begins type of movie with brilliant storytelling and character insight, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one at all costs!",5,0,1,19 July 2005
