Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode I is full of Eye Candy
","The Lights go down and the 20th Century Fox fanfare starts and I am as giddy as a school girl. The Star Wars Trilogy is almost a religion and now that George Lucas has made another films, Star Wars Die Hards can get another hit. Over all, The Phantom menace is just like every other Star Wars film; Poor plot, flat stereotypical characters, and nostalgia coming out the ying yang. Like the Saturday morning serials that it was based on,Star Wars is lovable yet so simply poor. This movie is another step up in special effects. It is full of 'Eye Candy' that leaves the moviegoer reeling. Plus the THX soundsystem just enhances that effect. The special effects are worth the $10.00 ticket, but don't expect to love the characters. They are all detached. It is not like the orignal where you fall in love with a dashing pirate or a beautiful princess. This movie There is not much empathy for the characters. The government uprising plot is filled with as much bureaucracy as let say... the government! The ships aren't as cool, although I wasn't expecting anything better than the millennium falcon. But with all that said, I go back and I can feel my childhood remembering what it was like to go to a galaxy far far away.",9,0,0,27 May 1999
