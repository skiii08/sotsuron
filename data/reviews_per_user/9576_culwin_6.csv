The Blair Witch Project," A mildly entertaining piece of fiction
","Presented in a documentary style, ala' 'War of the Worlds', this movie is a clever gimmick, but just doesn't live up to the hype.  I didn't find it realistic or scary at all, and it is actually rather boring in many places. This movie is probably best viewed a few years from now when all the hype has disappeared about it.  I would give it 6.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,4 August 1999
Unbreakable," Flawed but not broken
","I can't believe the extreme views I've read in the commentaries of this film.  It appears that people truly do love it or hate it.  I'm not so extreme. This is the only Shyamalan movie (except for 'The Buried Secret of...') that I have seen, so I can judge the film without comparing it to his other work. There were a few times during the movie where I said something was ridiculous, or wondered why Night decided to do something in a certain way. So this movie is hardly perfect in my book.  But you know what?  In the end, I liked it.  It kept me entertained and interested in what would happen next.  And the so-called 'twist' is not that much of a twist.  It is just a satisfying and logical ending to a Bruce Willis movie (something other directors seem to have a hard time doing). I rate this 7/10 - good, but not great, and not terrible.",7,2,4,14 August 2004
Good Will Hunting," 9.5
","I am torn between giving this movie a 9 or a 10.  I will not go into how good this movie is, because it has already been said many times.  But it is not quite a '10', because of a couple things.  Firstly, Minnie Driver's character seemed really unnecessary.  Why do they have to insert a romance into every movie?  It really ruins the plausibility of the movie - all of the other characters don't suddenly find their 'true loves', why does the main character always have to?  It really didn't even have much of anything to do with the story.Also, the idea that you have to go to Harvard or even college to get a good job is highly overrated.  If this kid is such a genius, there are many jobs he could just walk into (and probably be happier doing).  There is a middle ground between being a janitor and a 6 figure salary.Otherwise it is definitely a must-see flick, almost a 10.",9,2,6,25 March 1999
The Game," Worst Game Ever
","Wow, I haven't seen a movie this bad since 'Sliver'.  Like this other 'suspense thriller', the actors do a good job, and you can't even blame the director entirely.  The concept is interesting but the script falls a mile short, forcing the audience to let its intelligence to be insulted for 2 hours.There are so many mistakes and implausibilities in the movie, I'm sure I didn't even notice them all. But the most obvious: the timing of all of Douglas' encounters, the inability of the cops to do anything, Douglas' constant stupidity, and the fact that Douglas could have easily been killed on a few occasions.Even the ending is very Sliver-ish, because they backed themselves into a corner.  Not to ruin the ending for anyone, but there are only 2 possible endings, and so both are predictable - is everything real or is everything just a game?  Does the audience care??  I say no.  Because either way it is completely unbelievable.I highly recommend that you avoid this movie if you have half a brain, unless you want to see how NOT to make a suspense movie.  If you want to see a good suspense movie see The Firm or 12 Monkeys, two movies that are far less painful than this one.  I am off to smash my rented copy of this movie now.",5,3,6,25 March 1999
Empire Records," It's alright, nothing great
","Soundtrack is pretty good, with a mix of early 90's rock/pop bands and classic rock. Nothing too unusual, but I can't say it's not good. The movie itself though, feels... contrived (yes I know all movies are artificial, but they shouldn't feel like it). Even within its own universe, it doesn't even make sense sometimes. For example, the owner is supposed to be (we are told) a big jerk, but he never does anything jerky and in fact is nice enough to let Joe run the store however he wants. It's obvious they wanted this to be the 90's version of a John Hughes movie, but it just doesn't really work. You could easily find worse than this, but you could also do better.",6,0,0,26 February 2020
The Evil Dead," Better than expected
","I didn't expect much going into this film, but being a fan of Bruce Campbell, I had to finally check it out.  It is certainly not the 'masterpiece' that the 'Cult of Bruce' touts it to be, but still I was impressed.  This really is more than just a 'kids-in-the-woods-slash-em-up'; if you pay attention you can see some clever writing.  We see a budding Sam Raimi becoming a true artist at his craft.  We see a young Bruce Campbell in his first big acting 'gig'.  I was even impressed with the other never-heard-from-again actors.  I expected hammy performances all around, but it wasn't that bad at all.  Considering the pathetic budget and constraints they had to work with, this is a very watchable piece of work. A bit too much gore for my liking, but nevertheless I would recommend this to any fan of Raimi, Campbell, independent films, or the horror genre in general.  8/10 for fans, 6/10 for non-fans",7,0,1,17 May 2003
