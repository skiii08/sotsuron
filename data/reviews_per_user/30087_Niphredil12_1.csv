Despicable Me 2," Hilarious, a must see sequel.
","I've been watching a lot of movies this year, and making a list. So far I've seen 85 movies, and it's safe to say Despicable Me 2 is the funniest one of them all. The movie theater was composed of teenagers and college-aged people, surprisingly no one younger than, say, 15. But the room was never quiet with laughter. The jokes just kept coming, and they stayed funny, which is rather rare for a sequel. Often a sequel is simply a re-hashing of the same story, with some details changed, or else a completely different story just with the same characters, but Despicable Me 2 was neither. The story was a continuation of the characters we came to love in the first movie, with character development.I'm serious. If you need a 2 hour laugh, go see this movie.",8,10,19,26 June 2013
