Sucker Punch," You Must Be THIS TALL (Mentally) to Go on This Ride
","What is it with all the 'over the heads of the average movie-goer' movies lately? 'Inception,' 'There Will Be Blood' and 'The Hurt Locker' all expanded the envelope of what could be expected from Hollywood. I have to wonder just what this all means. Can the end be near? Is the dream collapsing, leading to plenty of 'edgy' entertainment that really requires the audience to be awake and paying attention? Far more 'cerebral' than '300' or 'Watchmen' this movie makes no effort to explain where it is coming from at all. You really are left on your own. You get it or you don't. What surprises me (a little) is that most of the critics (right now, March 26, 2011) are panning this movie even though it should be a monster hit and make a lot money, and so I expect that the critics will be changing their tune shortly. They tend to do that.Here's a preview of what the critics will sound like in a few weeks. Here is film that is inspired by Simulationism and by Dada. It has a simple premise, hinted at only in the movie's previews, that 'reality is a prison' and 'your mind can set you free.' No kidding. What's amazing is that this is coming at you with all the Hollywood bells-and-whistles. It's a mind-blowing fugue. An Aztec temple built to the Gods of Unreason. It's a riff on a sonnet by Nietzsche. No amount of explaining will explain it (but somebody has to be silly enough to try) and no amount of convincing will cause a hater to stop hating it.I know, I know that there is all this 'chop socky' stuff and lots of guns and chicks and stuff--and how can this anything 'high brow' be buried under a dump-truck load of CGI and girls and stuff that 'splodes?? Well, that's the age we live in. Deal with it. Post a negative review on IMDb. Go on--you know you want to. And if you work up the courage to gather together your own set of weapons, and go on that quest to find the answer to your own mystery--then you will have arrived at home, where you have never been.Hoo doggies--and thank God Almighty! It's glorious to be alive today and see a film like this!It makes no attempt what-so-ever to be politically correct and that right there is enough to make it one of the highest-grossing 'cult' films of all time. Nobody will want to admit that they like this movie (not at first, anyway) because nobody wants to be labeled a 'weirdo.' So what can we make of this? It's more 'over the top' than Tarantino at his very smarmiest. It's beyond redemption. It's all that and a bottle of tequila. It's perfect.I think I'll just end this review by providing some guidelines for parents and others. There are no 'scantily clad' women in this film (not by the standards of the present day). There are women who are wearing clothing that is 'suggestive' but that is hardly 'misogyny.' I think this movie does deserve an 'R' rating but the PG-13 is just Hollywood politics as usual. Don't have a cow over it. The sex in this film is virtually non-existent. The violence is certainly served up by the barrel and it's messed up in a fakey-violent way. But it's violent. But that's all meaningless--this movie is not really for kids, even large ones who still live in Mom's basement. It's for...shoot, I don't know. It's for somebody. Me, I guess.I loved it.

Zootopia," A Daisy
","Good film. I really, really approve of the message about caring for, and about others and not letting prejudice get in the way. Then I read some of the reviews here, and I found out what this movie is really all about.What this film really does best is highlight the ugly fact that many people on this planet are just mean. They're mean to everybody and they can't stand it that 'minorities' play 'identity politics' and ask to be excused from some creep being mean to them. I mean, if your way of life is being mean to prove you can 'take it' all the time--then having to be 'nice' to minorities seems like a YUGE imposition. After all, who do these people think they are? And then they blame the majority for making them (fill the blank) and that's just so UNFAIR! So I read the reviews on here and find out that many folks just do not understand being nice. It's not complicated. Be nice. Just be nice. Be nice. Nice. Be nice. Don't be mean. Be nice.Mean people. They rhyme with pluck. They don't like Zootopia.",10,1,6,4 June 2016
Us," Coyote Bad
","I would have walked out but I was with other people and there was no way to politely abandon this orphan. I guess the thing that troubles me the most is that this film really, truly failed to deliver in some very important ways, and I had to spend money and time and actually watch (most of) this abomination-- and I feel as if I am now owed something. An explanation. A refund. Maybe a gift card.Even if you really, really like zombie movies or horror films or whatever, this thing deserves a pass. It's like they took old elements of several horror sub-genres, like pieces of pizza left by kids after a birthday party, and then they glued those pieces together with cheese and tried to serve it up as a fresh pizza.I mean movie.I wanted to gnaw my own arm off to 'get out' of the theater. One star.",1,25,40,2 April 2019
Knives Out," The Best 'Go' Player Wins
","Big SPOILER alert.This movie makes NO sense if you just sit there like a potato and buy the premise that the guy who goes to jail at the end is the one who is 'really' responsible for the crime (not the murder, maybe, in a way). Yes, it's hard to wrap your mind around it, but 'Knives Out' subverts the 'who-dunnit' genre and that probably upsets some fans of the familiar old-fashioned detective story.So what? In the end, this film actually twists around and pays homage, true homage, to an old stale movie trope. The mystery is solved in an impossible way. Something, maybe good, maybe not, triumphs over something else and it's all mind bending in a way that would make Christopher Nolan proud.Let's review. ALL of the clues point to the 'least likely' suspect, but every red herring leads us to the 'obvious' bad-guy. Is it him? Is he the 'killer?' Well, if you just sit there and burp up your popcorn and don't think-- yeah, I guess the spoiled jerk is the bad-guy and goes to jail.But... who was the best Go player? Marta. Marta hides behind the goofiest 'tell' in modern memory, she vomits when she lies! Oh baby, that's CORNY. But she USES it to set a trap. All the idiots in this family of wealthy heels fall into it, and eventually the one guy who sees the truth understands that she's the one who orchestrated the whole thing, BUT he decides to let her go. She really is a 'good person.' The rotten family she worked for DESERVE what they get. Justice. More important than 'truth?' So Marta, who 'did it,' goes free with all the money in her pocket, leaving room for a sequel when they realize that they've been conn3d.Fun movie. Not a 'who-dunnit.' More of a 'con job' movie in the tradition of 'The Sting' or 'American Hustle.' Ten stars.",10,0,8,13 January 2020
Knowing," A Film That Kept Reminding Me of Video Games, But Not in a Good Way
","I'm getting tired of seeing plane crashes in movies where it's obvious that the writer did NO research and just imagined it. Stooo-pid. The plane crash in this film is just a perfect example of the fifteen-year-old gamer mentality that's on display.OH MAN! Did you see that? Did you see that guy on fire?!?!That guy woldn't burn like that!Would too!Not!Really this was a like a move made by Google after reviewing your gaming preferences. The story isn't bad, it's just drawn that way. If you want to see a GOOD movie about a similar idea, with truly creepy parts (assuming your IQ is over 90) then you should see The Mothman Prophecies. That was good and creepy. This is just a string of effects that are just as boring as all effects are, even in games.Give it a pass. It doesn't feel real and it doesn't work as fantasy.",5,0,0,4 July 2020
Hugo," All the more disappointing because of the talent behind it.
","Wow. I don't usually review films that I consider to 'mediocre' (I'm lazy so I review films that I love and ones that I hate--in-betweeners I tend to ignore). But 'Hugo' was such a disappointment that I have to drop in and post a review. It's a crying shame that so much talent resulted in such a boring movie.Where to begin? It's a kid's film, certainly, but that doesn't mean it should be stupid and unfortunately that's where we end up. The dialogue in this film reminded me of that line from (the vastly underrated Jamie Kennedy film) 'Starstruck'--'Real people don't talk like that!''Of course real people don't talk like that! It's called DIALOGUE!!'Yeah... IT'S CALLED DIALOGUE.Not one conversation in this film makes sense. The entire structure of the movie depends upon everyone being secretive when there is no need to be. It's nuts. It's just bad scriptwriting. Want suspense? Keep somebody in the dark! How simple! Especially if it's the audience that's being kept in the dark! Roger Ebert complains that he hates it when the audience can see something that is obvious but the characters are so dense that they can't see it. Here is a similar situation. All the characters know something that the audience does not, but the director assumes that the audience (children) are so dumb they won't be able to figure it out. It's tedious.Martin Scorsese, meet George Lucas. You two guys have perfected the art of making bad, expensive films that are supposed to please children but just annoy me.",4,4,8,24 March 2012
Dunkirk," Dunkirk Should be a Flop If There is Any Justice in This World
","I really liked Inception. I think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. But his latest film, Dunkirk, is a turkey. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not just saying that because I sat there and nit-picked the military hardware and special effects and found them lacking. I'm saying it because the movie was just plain bad.I will point out that I'm glad that some of my favorite actors got some work and were paid 'big picture' money to work on this. It's nice to see some really fine actors get paid. That's the only good thing I can think of to say. So let's get started on the bad stuff.Historical accuracy? Yeah, I'm a war nerd (tm) and I study war. I did notice a few 'errors' here and there but WHO CARES? The errors in historical baloney such as ships or planes or whatever just fade into nothingness compared to colossal error of making a movie about Dunkirk in which the blitzkrieg is missing. Blitzkrieg may have been real, or may have been some kind of historical fallacy, but it's a thing. It has to be in a movie about flippin' Dunkirk or nobody knows what's going on.This movie desperately needed a tiny touch of something to explain how all those soldiers ended up on the beach. A hint. Something. You just don't show 'lots of guys on the beach' and not expect somebody to ask 'what's this?'The blitzkrieg was missing. So were the Germans. No Germans. Just 'the enemy' said in such a 'suitable for television' manner as to cause anyone's ears to prick up. 'What did they not say? They censored the word 'Germans?' What??'Yes. Dunkirk is a movie that fails to identify 'the enemy' as The Third Reich. I'm calling bullshit on that. This is just embarrassing. No mention of Germans or Huns or Jerries or Heinies or Boche. No nothing.The word is 'stupid.'It gets worse.The film opens with a stunning display of poor soldiering by a British Tommy. He comes under fire so he stands up in a hot environment and then, failing to get rightfully shot, he throws down his rifle and runs for the rear. I wanted to shoot him myself but the realities of modern cinema make shooting characters on the screen pointless.We are then treated to some of the worst aerial footage in memory. Spitfires and Messerschmitts shoot each other. There is a discussion about saving ships and planes for The Battle of Britain. It's a short discussion. There is another short discussion about The Battle of France. Nobody cares, especially the people on screen. It's all very abstract, cold and meaningless.But never fear, we're treated to the inevitable result of shooting and bombing and killing. A man is rescued from a sunken ship, then, in a fit of dementia, he kills a teenage boy. Obviously that's what happens in war. Men go mad and kill boys.Well, if you want to believe that--go ahead. Just don't expect me to join you. I'm sure that a few British soldiers behaved badly during the Dunkirk battle. But that's not the story here. The fact that the vast majority of them did not behave badly is the story. Get it straight.They made a good movie about Dunkirk. It was called Mrs. Miniver. Watch that instead. Maybe the British back then were just too stiff and proper to be believable to us now. But that's not something that was wrong with them then, it's a symptom of what's wrong with us now.Addendum: It took me a couple of days to find the movie that sounds like this one. Yes, I hated the score by Hans Zimmer almost as much as the movie itself, because it was so distracting to try to remember 'where have I heard this before?' Well, I heard the music in the 1984 film 'The Bounty' by Vangelis. THAT music sounds so much like the music in this film that if I were Vangelis, I'd lawyer up.So yes, even the music sucked (I can hardly believe it). Hans Zimmer let me down.",1,47,86,2 August 2017
Legend," Second Time Around Not Better
","I went to this film with high hopes. I expected a grittier, meaner and, perhaps, even shocking version of what I already knew to be a gritty, mean and shocking story. 'The Krays' was a film that really hit the bulls-eye. Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese made a movie that same year ('Goodfellas') and it was so powerful that it just made 'The Krays' seem a bit weak, somehow. But that's the problem with movies that don't hit you over the head, but try to sneak it in with room-service. 'The Krays' was a very British version of a brutal gang-land movie. The unfortunate fact that 'Goodfellas' merged with it somehow in the imagination of film critics doesn't make 'The Krays' into something less. 'The Krays' was a work of genius, albeit one in which the psychology of brutes is explored in a way that make no effort to arrive at moral judgments. The Kray brothers were weird and dangerous. To make a new movie about them would, it seems to me, invite the filmmaker to explore just how weird and dangerous they were. Where that might lead, I don't know.I don't believe we'll ever know, because 'Legend' is a bit flat. It really isn't about anything shocking or weird, and that's probably because the filmmakers lost their nerve. It just isn't weird enough to cause nightmares, and when you're following an act like 'The Krays' you really should try, at least, to arrive at that place where nightmares are a possibility. 'Legend' is just a flat and remarkably dull telling of the same story. No surprises. Nothing really disturbing. Just two lads being naughty.Well, I expected more. I expected something truly perverse--and I'm not afraid to admit it. 'Legend' would have shocked audiences in 1970. It would have raised every hair on your head in 1960. It says something about how things are now that, today, it doesn't even raise an eyebrow.",6,0,3,29 December 2015
Get Out," Somebody's Making A LOT of Money on THIS
","Three and a half stars out of five. I deducted a half-star for the fact that it's obviously an amateur production, made much better than it should be by some very talented people who have bright, bright futures ahead of them. All in all, a fine effort and a load of fun for people who really dislike typical slasher films, because this isn't one. Nowadays, a 'horror' film can be just about anything including pornography, ersatz 'snuff' films and documentaries about the government. We all seem to be a trifle more mature now than we used to be, and Hollywood is throwing everything at us hoping something will stick. So it's fun and cool when a low-budget film doesn't just cop- out with gross-out horror or get lost in politics. I appreciate it when the filmmaker actually gives the audience credit for having a brain and using it.The camera work is this movie is seldom bad and often very good. The acting is surprisingly good, considering that we're not talking A- list cast here. The story is strong enough to keep you guessing and the little 'touches' that make or break a story like this are there.So what's wrong, if anything? Well, like a lot of low-budget 'thrillers,' Get Out begins to lose a little momentum as the requisite creepy buildup begins to change over into the inevitable 'action.' I don't think it's a spoiler to say that things get more fast-paced as the film progresses. It's during this part of the film where we begin to wonder just how far 'over the top' we're going to go--too far into 'that's dumb' land or not far enough into 'that's boring' land. Get Out almost pulls it off-- but in the end we feel that we watched a really good low-budget thriller, not a true work of art that will go down in history. On the other hand, most people don't like art films anyway. Seven out of Ten.",7,3,9,9 March 2017
The Hurt Locker," A Masterpiece in the Tradition of Stanley Kubrick
","I'm a fan of the work of Stanley Kubrick, and although I have seen films that pay homage to the master, I have never seen a film by another director that was able to convey the kind of energy that Kubrick conveyed in his films--until now. Kathryn Bigelow is not 'another Kubrick' but she has created a masterpiece of cinema, and that's not a small thing, and it shares many of the characteristics of Kubrick's greatest work.It never gives audience a break. You are expected (or demanded) to pay attention and absorb what you see. Kubrick always played fair, he never let you down by pulling you into the film and then exploiting your trust in him by asking you to overlook incompetence. His work was complete and contained within its own reality. 'The Hurt Locker' has this same quality of forcing you to accept the film on its own terms, and then providing a proper reward for your participation. As an audience, you have to work--but the reward is readily provided.Technology is woven into the film in new and interesting ways (something Kubrick was noted for). Most of the stern or negative comments on 'The Hurt Locker' come from U.S. Army veterans who critique it as if it were a documentary. Considering that it is a character study, this is not evidence that Bigelow made a poor film, it's evidence of how well she made it. It's so 'true' that it stirs up serious emotion among those who feel the danger as it is unfolding on the screen and feel compelled to do something about it--and correct the actions of those in danger. This is quite different from most 'war films' made in recent years ('Black Hawk Down' comes to mind) where the action portrays soldiers who behave like suicidal maniacs, and the result is so much like a comic book that it's beyond real criticism by real warriors.But 'The Hurt Locker' is too close to the bone to be 'forgiven' for technical errors. Too real.Finally, 'The Hurt Locker' makes no apologies. In the best tradition of Kubrick, it tells the story that the director wanted to tell, and sears it into your mind, if you consent to the operation. Few directors can achieve this kind of intensity in a film. The names of those who can are legendary. Hitchcock. Kubrick. Now, apparently, Bigelow.",10,18,33,26 July 2009
Ex Machina," I didn't hate it enough.
","SPOILERS AHEAD. So watch it.I have to admit that I went to see this film expecting something bad. I don't know why, but my shields were up. I just wanted to know HOW it was going to be bad.I didn't have to wait long to find out. You see, the guy who built the amazing sensitive woman robot (more on this later) is an alcoholic dude-bro who absolutely positively could not build that thing in real life. No. He lifts weights. He boxes. He pounds down fifths of vodka. I might like to party with this cowboy but I cannot imagine this guy building anything but a really big sandwich. It's preposterous. The guy is so stupid that I thought HE would turn out to be some kind of robot-red herring but, nope, he is ACTUALLY supposed to be this super-genius who becomes a trillionaire and takes over the internet at the age of thirteen.Please.He's the same actor who appeared in 'Sucker Punch' (a better movie about objectifying women) and he was a good villain in that and he should stick with villains. Dumb villains. If he shows up in a few more stinkers his career could tank--so he should not take any more roles where he plays a brainiac. I have some bad news. Brainiacs are nerdy people. They have issues. Social anxiety. They might actually BUILD a girl-bot for those lonely nights in Glacier National Park after they, like, bought it and stuff 'cause they were so rich. But not this guy. He's not the type. That's that. You can call me a racist or bigot or whatever all day and all night. It's a fact.Actually, this movie could have taken the whole 'what is intelligence?' thing and ran with it. It could have taken the whole 'what is sexual attraction?' thing and ran with that. But it chose not to run with anything. It chose to sit there. Now about that sensitive female robot. I could imagine a film where the idea of 'sensitivity' is explored and the notion of 'femininity' is examined. That would be a good film. I would write a good review of that. But this wasn't that movie. The sensitive robot woman is, sorta, oh man, I don't know, supposed to be a real girl, like Pinocchio, or something. It's just painful. She is a MACHINE. When the movie tries to imply that she isn't a machine, we go directly to creepy. By the way, this movie offended my sense of smell,too. Something about being in that enclosed space with the HVAC system conking out every time the robot charges up--I dunno. I felt, after a while, I could actually SMELL the place. Or maybe it was that guy behind me eating the mushu pork.But I digress.The movie doesn't really reach down and turn fully stupid until the ending, where our hero (barely our hero) discovers that dude-bro the genius is making women suits and then teaching them to bark like a dog. He hangs up the old girl-bots in a kind of bachelor pad from Hell that he shares with the one bot that he never taught to speak (a whole 'nother movie could be made from that, but no).Eventually, the robots kill the dude-bro and at this point I couldn't take it. I went out in the hall. Sitting in that awful seat watching an awful movie was giving me leg cramps. I missed the ending but that, I assure you, was nothing. Whatever happened, it could not have undone the damage.Avoid.",4,39,85,7 May 2015
War Machine," What Planet Am I On?
","Apparently, a large number of Americans are unaware that we have been fighting several nasty wars on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for nearly two decades. The insane part of this is not the loss of lives, property or the reputation of the United States--it's that the awful truth has revealed that deep down, a large percentage of Americans just don't care about other people, don't care about good government, don't care about puppies or flowers or fresh baked cookies. A large number of Americans seem to be unplugged in some fundamental way. Soul-less. This movie restores a little (very little) of my faith in my fellow McDonald's eaters. The outright horror of Afghanistan is portrayed as a joke, because, dad-gummit, showing Kirk Douglas raging at generals and three sorry dupes being shot in cold blood 'to encourage the others' just doesn't have the same punch it used to have. People used to expect a cocktail to be mixed with pride by a skilled bartender. Now, if it doesn't contain a severed finger it's good to go. Our ability to judge our own lives is now suspect. This film dares to aim a punch straight at the nose of the al-mighty. If it misses just a little--well, ten out of ten for the effort. I could not stand to watch another sappy piece of propaganda showing some babe-a-licious soldiers doing their duty in some god-forsaken part of Southern California while wondering 'what is it all for' aloud. It's not for anything. This whole place is out of order. You're out of order. At one time, being 'anti-war' was normal for Americans. Now, things are worse. It's a mess, and it gets worse every day. We have to do something. If present trends continue, then some clownish general will roll down Pennsylvania Avenue and arrest the government. WAKE UP. Films like this are small but vital steps in the right direction. Brad Pitt did the right thing here. We need to end illegal wars and stop crimes against humanity in the name of the people of the U.S.A.",10,284,426,26 May 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It's No Kung Fury
","In 2015 a new cinematic age began. In that year, the movie 'Kung Fury' appeared in a world that had been ready for its release for many, many centuries.But some things take time. Now, at last, we have entered the 'Post Kung Fury' age and all smart-aleck behavior, from here on out, shall be judged on how well it stacks up when compared to the great touchstone film itself--Kung Fury. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fine piece of movie-making. It contains all the wonderful things from the first movie, and it succeeds in not boring us with a pointless recap when we could always just go to IMDb and read the synopsis. But we're living two years AFTER Kung Fury. AFTER. You can't just press-on like it was 2014. Kung Fury marked the dawn of a new age. There was smart-aleckry PRIOR to Kung Fury, and smark-aleckry AFTER. We are living in the Year 2 A.K. (two years after Kung Fury) so a lot of the humor here, which would have been knee-slappin' good three years ago, is now just starting to grow a bit...stale. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 is like your uncle who desperately tries to be hip, and works very hard at it, but is always six months behind. GOTG Vol. 2 is often embarrassing because you know they are working so darned hard, and it's so sad to see how far they are from the new normal. Every time some 'clever' thing was said, I kept hearing the words 'That would explain the laser raptors' in my head. Yeah. Sure it was funny, Uncle Pete. (Just not that funny). You try and you try to make a big, tent-pole movie about monsters and fathers and raccoons and then you work your fingers to the bone for you kids and what do you get?

Ben-Hur," No Electrons Were Harmed in the Making of this Film (spoilers)
","The first movie I ever saw in the theater was the immortal BEN HUR. I was taken downtown to the Egyptian Theater in Ogden, Utah by my movie-loving parents, and the experience blew my five-year-old brains out. For years afterward, I wondered why The Egyptian didn't take down the decorations they had installed for Ben Hur. I also felt a compulsion to see any movie with a poster that looked like the one for Ben Hur. Ghenghis Khan. El Cid. Anything with giant letters crawling with historical figures drew my intense interest.It's not really perfect, but I remember it that way. This movie has some pretty significant flaws--but they can be deliberately overlooked. Still, it takes some major overlooking not to notice that the horrible disfigurement of Ben Hur's mother and sister isn't... really... so... horrible. In fact you can barely see it. The way they act, you'd think they were dying of leprosy or something! Sheesh.Then comes the miraculous healing. What is that, exactly? If you have the Blue Ray you'll just barely be able to see Christ's blood pouring into the cave. Otherwise, you just have to imagine it.So, what does it mean when the emotional climax of a true Hollywood blockbuster is blunted by the fact that they WEREN'T that sick-looking, and the source of the healing seems to be some rain??Uhhh... it means that the director should have hit this nail a little more squarely and a little harder. He needed some Hammer Horror makeup to show the lepers dragged from the dungeon, with flesh dripping off, etc. And he needed that blood to drip off a toe and then down the hill into the cave, and maybe a little more Hammer Horror technicolor blood to Hammer that point home again. Otherwise, dumb little kids like me would have to wait for years to figure it all out. I mean, come on. Give a little kid a break!Other than that. TEN out of TEN. Aye, you'll no see 'em made like this again, laddy. All real people, horses, ships and, gosh, they had to re-create the Roman Empire to make this work.I guess they couldn't re-create the crucifixion, though.",10,0,0,12 May 2020
Godzilla," Bad is the New Good
","I went to this movie with high expectations, as did so many others, and I was disappointed, as were so many others. But that's not what motivated me to write a review. It's the aggravating behavior of some of the 'fans' who just keep on churning out garbage on here about how the film is just like other, older 'monster' films but tired, old, worthless (did I say old?) people don't like anything NEW so they hate this. It's like the Star Wars Prequels. 'You miserable oldies hate it 'cause it's new! You hate anything that belongs to us, the young! You old people don't appreciate anime and don't like youth culture! YOU'RE JUST MEAN (AND OLD!)' Bull. Some slimy operator found out that you can hide behind the 'youth culture' badge and get away with making garbage as long as you say 'it's new.' Like the new Godzilla. Hey--it's anime enhanced! It features old actors looking pathetic (look at the old monkeys! Aren't they funny?) and an old monster who is SO BORING (MOM! I've SEEN Godzilla destroy a city SO MANY TIMES! BOOORING!) No. It's not good because it's new. It's bad because it's bad. Anime is bad. It's all bad. All of it. Not one single drop of good on planet Anime. Lousy. It's all about animators who specialize in making EVERYTHING look EPIC. Brush you teeth. EPIC. Watch TV. EPIC. Since everything is epic, NOTHING IS. TOO MUCH EQUALS NOTHING. I got that from the TAO TE CHING. Right across the lake from Japan. So how did they miss that? When everything is EPIC nothing is, and so then, in order to make something EPIC they have to come out and say 'THIS IS EPIC!' What happened to SHOW don't TELL?

Joy," Too Close to the Truth
","We need more movies like this--but they're not going to show up any time soon. I've started a little funky business from scratch using next-to-no money and plenty of 'sweat equity.' It's a nightmare. Every new business is subjected to 'running the gauntlet' of predators and parasites who live to infect, sicken and destroy new businesses.It's not fashionable to talk about it, but the hazards that Joy faces in this film ARE NOT peculiar, rare or unlikely. They are TYPICAL of the kinds of problems encountered by anyone trying to start a business who doesn't have plenty of muscle--and by that I mean 'pull' at city hall or elsewhere that allows you to push back when the parasites start to sink in their claws.But most small businesses are started by people who are not business experts and don't have 'pull'--they are like baby turtles trying to reach the ocean and being eaten by birds, snakes, crabs, sharks and every other animal on the beach. Joy's trials are the type that usually prove fatal or near-fatal to newcomers to the business world. It's a jungle out there--and that's a fact.We need more films like this so I'm giving it a 10.",10,5,13,14 February 2016
Her," One of the Best
","I can't believe it took me so long to finally see this film. It is a true masterpiece. But I read some reviews and listened to a few friends and they all declared it to be something a little below average...maybe a failure.What?!? I should have suspected that they might be failing to do the one thing you really need to do in order to enjoy science fiction--you have to think. If you just blow into this movie after a few stiff drinks and fail to engage your brain, maybe it won't work for you. I don't know. But the ideas here--the imagination--it's incredible! Everything that clunkers like 'Tomorrowland' or 'Ex Machina' got wrong this movie gets right. Super performance from Joaquin Phoenix, super, subtle and amazing special effects (if you didn't see any you need to sleep it off and see the movie again). At every point where the filmmakers could have chickened out, they said 'sail on' and this kind of integrity is a rare and beautiful thing.Truly one of the top science fiction films of all time--this movie deserves to be discussed, argued over and maybe even fought over at the next science fiction convention in my hometown. I might even set up a little panel discussion on it--but I do know that science fiction without bug-eyed-monsters or stupid, fascistic wars is a little hard for some folks to accept.Well so what? Who needs them? A final word--if the basic premise, that a guy falls for his operating system, is something that you just can't accept and really hate and want to kill--then stay home, or dial up Star Wars on streaming. This movie makes no attempt (and it SHOULDN'T) to convince you that this is real. It just is.",10,0,3,29 December 2015
The Nice Guys," Great Film for Old Guys Like Me
","Yeah. Yeah I'm giving it a ten. Just because of the age thing. I don't know if this movie was really a '10' but I enjoyed it immensely. So much that I used the word 'immensely' which I don't do, much.I went to see this film on another of my 'at the mall, have to kill time' movie afternoons and it was this or 'Angry Birds.' I mentally tossed a coin and went in, expecting to be disappointed. Well, I wasn't. But I'm a weird guy. I like Monty Python. A lot. I like a certain kind of messed-up humor--not poop jokes but jokes ABOUT poop jokes. I found the jokes in this to be laughing out loud funny, and the last 'comedy' that I laughed out loud at was 'The Birdcage' with Robin Williams.So your mileage may vary. I like it. I liked it a lot. It is tough (no...it's just about impossible) to make a 'real' detective movie now, since the Cohens made 'The Big Lebowski.' But somehow, this movie pulls it off. It's really a true, hard-boiled detective story with plot and humor and everything. I'm not kidding. Plenty of plot twists and all that stuff.But the movie did remind me that I'm weird as well as old. I can remember the seventies. The seventies were a friend of mine. This film is not from the seventies. But WHO CARES? This isn't about the seventies, at all. It's about NOW. Sheesh.Now that you know where I stand, I should tell you that most 'cop' shows make me sick. I can't stand a movie about America's Finest busting bad guys. Fascist crap. So this movie is for people who like movies that aren't fascist crap. So sue me. Stay away if you like fascist crap. A word to the wise. Now you can click 'helpful.'",10,7,16,23 May 2016
Up in the Air," Another Great Film About Men
","There are are a lot of movies out there about machismo. About a million of them. But there are very few about masculinity, and only a few of them are really good. The thing is, these films are difficult to review because people tend to get emotional about them. They hit us where we live. Men (and women) just get all worked up about them. They cause normally reasonable people to go all weird. The most recent examples of the genre are 'There Will Be Blood,' 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Up in the Air.' These are movies that explore the dark side of masculinity with flinching. They illustrate aspects of being male that have been, almost always, glossed over with macho nonsense. They explore what it means to be masculine.What makes 'Up in the Air' different from most other films of this type is that it is very, very NOW and features a lot of cool technology. But the story is the same in that it is about what is going on inside the mind of a man--in this case a man who has found a new way to to be an isolated, alienated man. He's found a home en route to somewhere else. He is perpetually going somewhere. So much so that his home is in the air.This is not so different from other men who choose to live as 'lone wolves' but in his case he's managed to integrate it into a high-paying career. What a country! But the film is not about how a guy can just travel all the time on the company dime, it's about being a predator and living, literally, like a wolf and loving every minute of it. As my wife said, it's the 'hunter thing' again. Guys like to hunt alone and kill stuff. Is it really so surprising that the guy in this movie likes to travel alone and 'terminate' people? The fundamental question-- 'what is home?' is asked again and again. As the film develops, it becomes clear that a man is only as stable as his home--whatever that may be--and if you throw a man out of his home--even if it is in the air--even the 'coolest customer' may panic and behave irrationally until the 'stable home (in the air)' is restored.A masterwork, highly recommended. But not for kids. In fact, I wonder if you really need some gray hair and to be a little condescending to younger people to really 'get' this movie.Sorry if that sounds condescending...",10,5,12,27 December 2009
