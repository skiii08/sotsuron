Deepwater Horizon," Sound of dialog is poor
","The development of the situation -- in which safety and maintenance corners were cut because of project delays, is realistic, and quite well done. The overall action and special effects are good, and gripping. But the big loss for viewers is the inaudible conversation. We couldn't hear much on our newer Sony Bravia with or without Philips sound-bar. So we watched it on our older Panasonic Quintrix TV (with LG DVD player), and that was A LOT better. However, I still had to ramp the sound up for some quieter conversations; and then down for the deafening explosions and other sound effects (chopper noise etc). In that sense it was one of the poorer movies we've ever watched. Maybe it was aimed at movie audiences...with ear-plugs. One of the other reviewers commented on the poor audio, as well. So we're not alone.",4,0,0,2 April 2017
