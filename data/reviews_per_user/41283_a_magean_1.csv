Hereditary," Overhyped 'horror' for the snowflake generation
","The trailer said this generations excorcist. If that was the case then I despair for the new generation. This must be the worst film I have seen in over a year, I include all of those rubbish films the sci-fy channel keep churning out these days. Apart from the rubbish ending I found that you never really warm to any of the characters. I'm not going to spoil this for others but do yourself a favour and actually watch the exorcist, the void or even one of the tongue in cheek horrors like drag me to hell than this garbage.",2,0,2,1 September 2018
