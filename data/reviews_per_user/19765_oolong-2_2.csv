The Blair Witch Project," not for those who get motion sickness
","The jittery camera work made my wife sick. This effect may enhance the film for some.It seems that most people loved it or hated it.  I usually really enjoy things that fall into this category. However, I found myself wondering what time it was at several times during the film - not a very good sign.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," exceptionally well crafted
","I don't feel the pacing of Eyes Wide Shut is any different from any other Kubrick film.  I believe the rest of the industry has evolved to another standard of pacing. There are no wasted moments in this film.The movie is beautiful to look at.  The lighting and camera work are eye candy.  All the individual lights in the ball room scene are in sharp focus at the center and gradually become more diffused as the move off the screen. Lots of contrasting warm and cool tones when kidman and cruise are in scenes together.I got *really* tired of the piano underscore. I *like* minimalism but this was grating.I don't feel the story, script and acting were up to the production quality of the rest of the film.The final word in the film is an interesting way to end Kubrick's career.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
