The Blair Witch Project," Scary As Hell
","This movie is scary as hell. However, some people find this movie very boring and lame, however I find it extremely scary that nobody can see what is really happening to the characters when they are filming this movie. However, I didn't find the whole body of the movie as scary as some people make it as, but there are definitely some very scary parts that are just very atmospheric but not gory or violent. For example, the discovery of the pile of rocks was very scary, the discovery of the wooden 'witch stick figures' was also very scary as well. The scariest part for me however, took place in the abandoned house...enough said, this movie is scary...don't watch it alone and in the dark. This movie contains lots of profanity, and very VERY little few violence, only one scene that is truly gory/violent..",10,1,3,25 April 2005
