The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Insight about introverts to extroverts!
","The 102 min movie, 'The Perks of Being a Wallﬂower' is an American coming-of-age comedy-drama ﬁlm adaptation of the 1999 epistolary novel of the same name, by the director of the movie. The movie is about a 15-year old boy, named, Charlie (Logan Lerman), whose best friend had recently committed suicide. He is an introvert high school freshman who struggles to make friends due to some of his past experiences. So he maintains a diary as a substitute friend. Charlie has special interest in Literature and Music. He is striving to ﬁnd his own niche. Events take a turn when he meets Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his step-sister, Samantha (Emma Watson). The trio soon starts to share a perfect rapport, found out their common interests and the value of each other. The movie goes about, picturizing the experiences of this trio and a group they belonged to. The movie is about the highs and lows of the teenage life. It is very emotional, didactic and catchy as well. The direction was good, with nice cinematography and music, but the movie had an abrupt ending, and a few facts were not clearly explained. Since the characters of the movie liked a certain kind of music, you are sure to fall in love with it! Especially the tunnel song (Heroes). The picturization of the exact experiences of the protagonists were very good, and the mood of the movie is so perfect that you will actually feel the movie even though you don't actually understand it.",8,0,1,15 August 2014
