10 Cloverfield Lane," Good Job
","My rating 8 is like everybody Else's 10, I do not exaggerate my ratings.Dan Trachtenberg, Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken, Damien Chazelle on purpose or not, you exposed the extent of Democrats 'Social Experiments' since the 1950s.Democrats 'Conditioning', 'Indoctrinations', 'Social Engineering', 'Brainwashing', that anytime that something goes against those those 'Indoctrinated' 'Brainwashed' 'Programmed' turn into Haters.Psychologically their brains turn off, physiologically they have a nasty taste in their mouths. This is why all the low ratings of this Movie, especially from the Millennial Generation, Generation Y and Generation Z, that have absolutely No Knowledge of the Decades during the U.S.S.R., (Democrat U.S. Labor Union Owned Teachers and Professors preaching Democrat Propaganda instead of actually Teaching) 'Fallout Shelters' everywhere, 'Duck and Cover', as the U.S. Government's Real Attempts to save as much of the U.S. Population as possible, then came the Democrats embracing the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction, the Democrats Hatred of the U.S. Defense resulted in 'Fallout Shelters' no longer funded nor maintained, 1970 the 130 Anti Ballistic Missile Defense Sites to protect the U.S. Cities and Millions of U.S. Citizens at the U.S. Removed while the Democrats continued to Cut the U.S. Defense Budget during every Democrat Administration and diverted more and more of the U.S. Budget to Democrat Socialist Welfare Programs, resulting in a U.S. Defense Non Mission Capable and the loss of the Democrats Demanded Save the Democracy of the Republic of South Korea War (Democrats cut Funds before, during, after), Democrats Demanded Save the Democracy of the Republic of South Vietnam War (Democrats cut all Funds 1973), Democrats 1998 Demanded (Democrats U.S. Laws Declared Wars) Wars at Iraq and Afghanistan (Democrats U.S. Laws cut funds 1993 to 2001, 2006, 2009 to 2017).U.S. Laws, not your ignorant opinions, prove I am correct.So where would the U.S. Defense be during this Invasion? Non Mission Capable. And Democrats perverted the Mission of the U.S. Defense of the U.S. Constitution from only Defense against Invasion and Domestic Violence to the Use of U.S. Military Force to Force Democracy on other Nations Constitutional Republics (like the U.S.), Republics, Parliamentary Governments, Constitutional Monarchies, Real Democracies, Sovereign Nations, etc., as the Democrats U.S. Law Posse Comitatus stops U.S. Defense from stopping Invasion and Domestic Violence (Democrats previous Domestic Violence 1781 to 1787, 1861 to 1865).Demo-crats then Demo-n-ized anybody that even considered restarting the U.S. Fallout Shelters as 'Paranoid' as the Democrats means to be dismissive of the Facts (History of what U.S. had before). 'Howard' (John Goodman) appearing to the Democrat 'Conditioned' viewers as excessively 'Paranoid'. Meanwhile, Real World Multi $Millionaires to Multi $Billionaires are buying remodeled previous Nuclear Attack Proof previous U.S. Air Force ICBM Silos and ICBM Command and Control Centers 'Just in Case'.",8,0,2,25 March 2019
It," Better than the previous It
","This version of It, did not drag on like the previous It.However there are somethings that are missing from the previous 1990 TV Series It.Understandable that a movie of just over 2 hours cannot have as much as a TV Series.If they did make this version longer and more detailed ('Boring'), most Non Stephen King Fans more than likely would have got up and left the Theater.The Special Effects were good, still do not like scenes that are so dark you cannot see anything, even if that is for 'Dramatic Effect'.Why do all basements have to be so dark, when I lived at Europe there were windows all over the tops near the basement 'ceiling' (floor of the house) of the basement, there were also lots of bright florescent lights.The Children floating in the air, started coming down, so what happened next, was not elaborated on in this version.",7,2,12,10 September 2017
Glory," States many Historical Facts, but emphasizes Slavery.
","States many Historical Facts, but emphasizes Slavery.The Main Issue that caused the U.S. Civil War was the Democrat Traitors 'Succession' (an Act of Treason) from the Republic of America's The Union of States of the United States of the Republic of America of the Republican 1787 U.S. Constitution, and Democrats then forming their own Democratic Nation of the Confederate States of America of the previously failed Democracy 1781 Articles of Confederation.Simply stated, Republic of America versus Democracy of America.The Union of States of the United States of the Republic of America of the Republican 1787 U.S. Constitution Versus the Democracy of America as the Confederate States of America of the Democracy 1781 Articles of Confederation.Demanded that All U.S. States create and have 'a Republican Form of Government', or not be protected from '(British) Invasion' nor 'Domestic Violence' like Shays Rebellion or the Democracy Rebellion, Democracy Riots, Democrats Extreme Violence 'The Seeds of Democracy hath sprouted into the Tyranny of the (Democrats) Lynch Mobs' - General George Washington without a Standing Army (Standing Army not Authorized by the Democracy 1781 Articles of Confederation).Authorized the current 'a Republican Form of Government' as the Three Branches of Government (Executive (President and Vice President), Legislative (U.S. Congress, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives), Judicial (U.S. Supreme Court). As a Representative Form of Government is Republican and NEVER Democrat.The 12th Amendment to the Republican 1787 U.S. Constitution would stop the Democrats 'Popular Votes' from determining the U.S. President and U.S. Vice President by creating the Republican Electoral College Process.The other Primary Causes of the U.S. Civil War was MONEY and Resources.Most of the Republican States of the Union of States of the United States of the Republic of America were being cut off from Food and Resources, most Republican States had stopped being Agricultural Based Economies and moved towards Manufacturing so being Food Self Sustainable no longer existed to feed the increasing Populations at Republican States. While most of the Democrat States were still Agricultural Based Economies that also had lots of Resources. The Republican States were heavily reliant on the Democrats States for Resources for Manufacturing, especially Democrats cotton for the Republican States Textile (cloth and clothing Manufacturing aka the first 'Sweat Shops').The movie Glory, does depict the Mass Migration, but on a very small scale, and only of Negroes (about a Hundred0. The Mass Migration occurred shortly after the Democrats Succeeded from the Republic of America and created their Democratic Nation of the Confederate States of America. Many Republicans fled to the Republican States, most Democrats fled to the Democrat States. This caused many problems as most of the Republicans and Negros fleeing the Democratic States ended up in the Republican States 'Ghettos', as most did not have the Manufacturing Skill Sets of the Republican States Manufacturing Based Economies. The Democrats that fled to the Democrat States were not 'Established' and did not own land, farms, plantations, nor have ancestral ties to those Democrat States many would end up poor and as heavily in Debt Indentured Servants (Caucasian Slaves) or as later 'Share Croppers' (treated like slaves).At the very beginning of the British Colonies at America, the British emptied out their British Prisons overcrowded with Religious Dissidents (against the Church of England), Political Prisoners, Common Criminals, Murders, Rapists, Thieves, lots of Irish as hated by the British, Debtors (could not pay the British Taxes), as sentenced to 'Transportation' as shown in the well Researched TV Series American Gods Season 1 Episode 7 'A Prayer for Mad Sweeney' as Tells the story of Essie, an Irish girl sentenced to 'Transportation' to the British Colonies at America, and depicted the very harsh conditions of the One Way Boat Ride to the British Colonies at America as British (Prison, Penal) Colonies at Massachusetts, Virginia, Georgia. Later on the British used the Continent of Australia, British Colonies at Tasmania, New Zealand as Penal (Prison) Colonies to empty out the overcrowded British Prisons at England.Military The movie Glory 1989 could not depict that many people (Combatants) as 1000s even if you use the so called (not very well researched) Company being 100, a Regiment still consisted of at least 10 Companies 100 times (x) 10 is 1000. Thousands to hundred of thousands of recreation uniforms, rifles, military equipment, the logistics to feed, temporarily house, pay, sanitation, for that many, nearly impossible.How used during the U.S. Civil War After the constant defeats of the Republicans' Union Army by the Democrats' Confederate Army and the Resulting significant loses of Soldiers of the Republicans' Union Army the decision was made to create All Negro Segregated Union Army Units to dig latrines, build fortifications, create roads to haul supplies, to free up Caucasian Union Army Soldiers to fight. Same idea as today's U.S. Civilian Contractors hired to do the 'labor'.After further loses by the Republicans' Union Army, with even more significant numbers of losses of lives, the Republicans finally decided to use the Segregated Negro Union Army Units to Fight, as Suicide Units, given minimal amounts of ammunition, their main attack was the bayonet charge against heavily fortified Democrat Confederate States of America Fortifications.The idea was to continue to send the Segregated Union Army Negro Units in bayonet charges until the Democrats defending the Confederate States of America Fortifications ran out of ammunition.",7,1,3,3 August 2017
Dunkirk," Why Dunkirk Happened
","After World War 1, the Spanish Flu Pandemic killed most of the Prime Combatant Age 17 to 29 year olds that would fight World War 2, leaving the Old to take care of the children, this decimated many of the World's Large Militaries.After World War 1, the French spent most of France's Wealth on building concrete fortifications, as the Maginot Line. Very little was spent on the French Military (Men and Equipment).The 1929 to 1939 Global Great Depression occurred, most Nations were Bankrupt and spent their Nation's money on everything except their Nation's Defense, while Chancellor Hitler spent most of the Nation of Germany's money on building up the German Military. The Japanese Military built up.The Modern German Military easily defeated the French Fortifications of the Maginot Line, by bypassing the Maginot Line thru the Belgium Forests. The French Fortifications Weapons could not traverse 360 degrees, the Germans sieged the French Fortifications of the Maginot Line and waited for the French starvation to force the French at the Maginot Line to Surrender, because there was not much spent on the French Military (Men and Equipment) the French Military was still using World War 1 Equipment and the French Military was very small (numbers of men). The small French Military (mostly Infantry) and British Military (mostly Infantry) attempted to stop the German Blitzkrieg from bypassing the Maginot Line and were crushed by German Modern Armor (Tanks) and Mechanized Infantry, the survivors then fled to Dunkirk (not a Port, water too shallow), instead of Calais (a French Port). Most British Ships were in convoys going to and from the U.S., most British Aircraft were providing Air Cover for the Strategic Supply Convoys from the U.S..The British Empire was collapsing, the British Empire lost most of the Strategic Resources for British Manufacturing, Fuel for Aircraft, Ships, and Vehicles. The British became heavily reliant on Democrat U.S. President Labor Intensive U.S. Military Defense Industrial Complex for even food to feed the British Civilian Population.Most of the British Officers failed to take the initiative to regroup most of the 'able bodied' (not wounded) Armed Soldiers (over 330,000) into Units and attack the German Wehrmacht at the weaker flanks. This lack of British Officer Initiative allowed the Germans to attack south then move west, and then north to completely cut off Dunkirk. Just as British General Montgomery failed to destroy the trapped German Army at the Falaise Pocket after the Normandy Invasion, resulting in the disaster of British General Montgomery Operation Market Garden at the Netherlands as to where some of the German Army escaped to from the Falaise Pocket, the other part of the German Army that escaped would be used during 'The Battle of the Buldge'.The German Wehrmacht Blitzkrieg was primarily attacking south towards Calaise, not towards Belgium, and supported by the Majority of the German Luftwaffe.The majority of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) were Hawker Hurricanes (709) as cheaper made of cloth and wood, and not the more expensive Supermarine Spitfires ((372) made of 'Al-e-min-e-Um', British pronunciation. Aluminum costed as much as gold. The RAF Spitfires would be withheld to 'the Defense of the British Isles' Only (Battle of Britain). Both looked the same from the ground at a distance, except the wings rectangular on a Hawker Hurricane, elliptical on a Spitfire, both sounded the same as using the Rolls Royce Merlin Engine.German Navy's Focke Wolf 200 Condor Anti Ship aircraft with low altitude bomb sights to attack surface vessels not Luftwaffe Heinkel 111 with Higher Altitude Area Bomb Sights. Most of the German Luftwaffe's Heinkel 111s were bombing in advance of the German Blitzkreig, and the Messerschmidt BF-109s were doing 'strafing' as air to ground attacks, as the French Air Force and the British Air Force at Belgium and France were defeated before the German Blitzkrieg Attack. Using the German Navy's FW 200 Condors meant less German Luftwaffe He 111s diverted from the German Blitzkrieg.With the Japanese Invasion of China, and the French Colonies at Asia, the French Lost the Strategic World's Rubber at their French Indochina (Vietnam) Colonies to the Japanese.At the U.S. the U.S. Defense Budget was severely cut, the U.S. Military was stuck with Obsolete World War 1 Equipment, 1911-1929 Battlerams (not Battleships) at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, U.S. Territory of Hawaii. While the Modern German Battleships of the Bismark and Tirpitz were launched with radar guided guns. The Japanese concentrated on the New Projection of Power of Air Craft Carriers, and built the Modern Battleships Yamamoto and Musashi. The U.S. Battleship Admirals that controlled the U.S. Department of the Navy refused to acknowledge that the Days of the Battleship as the Projection of Power were over, and continued to spend most of the U.S. Defense Budget on building Battleships.The U.S. Military was mostly used as a Social Program to House, Feed, Cloth, most U.S. Citizens of the 1929 to 1939 Great Depression.The Majority of the U.S. Population were National Socialist Democrats, that strongly believed in Germany's National Socialist German Worker's Party, a Political Labor Union, and demanded U.S. not Enter the War at Europe, as U.S. Isolationism. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company had stated his Support of Germany's National Socialist German Worker's Party, and denounced the Jews during his Speeches all over the U.S., printed copies of the easily discredited Blame the Jews for Everything Conspiracy Theory 'Protocols of the Wise Elders of Zion' to be given away free to those that attended his Nationwide Speeches.'Repeat the Same Mistakes and Expect A Different Result', as after every 'Armed Conflict' or War the U.S. Cuts the U.S. Defense Budget (U.S. Military, U.S. Intelligence Agencies, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Civilian Defense Contractors, other U.S. Government Defense Related.) from over 20 percent to about 11 percent, as setting up the U.S. Defense to Fail.",4,2,12,22 July 2017
The Mountain II," Good Movie spoiled by Reality
","Dag 2 (The Mountain 2) is an accurate portrayal of the Turkish Special Forces.There is a glitch of what we learned to do, as when we are running low on ammunition, we start collecting AK47s, SVDs, RPG7s, Hand grenades any ammunition they are carrying from those we killed.Reason why during training we train a lot with those Enemy weapons. Even if we are not running low on ammunition we collect those weapons, ammunition, to later distribute to the Afghan Civilians so that they can defend themselves against raids by the Taliban. At Northern Iraq we did the same thing. Dag 2 depicts Northern Iraq, Southern Turkey during the Summer time, conditions there are much worse during the Winter, as depicted by The Breath 2009 and Dag 2012. At Afghanistan in the Winter time the conditions at the Pamir (Roof of the World) and Hindu Kush (Killer of Hindus) are Near Arctic.The Reality that spoiled Dag 2 (The Mountain 2) 2016, is we had refresher training with the German (Bundeswehr) Commandos at the German Alps as Mountain Warfare (including Technical Mountain Climbing) followed by more Mountain Warfare Refresher Training with the Turkish Special Forces at Southern Turkey, our 'Training' was actually hunting Kurdistanis of the PKK, HPG, KGK, Ansar Al Islam at Southern Turkey under conditions identical to Afghanistan's 2/3rds Mountains before being deployed again to Afghanistan. Previously, we had graduated from the U.S. Army's Mountain Warfare School, and Arctic/Winter Warfare School. From our Training with the Turkish Special Forces we KNOW that they (Turkish Special Forces) have almost ZERO latitude or discretion, so they could not have evacuated the children nor defended the village, the Turkish Military Command and Turkish Politicians would have basically 'disowned', 'disavowed' their existence and not send anyone nor anymore assets.To be 100 percent fair about the Turkish Military another Movie Must be made, in 2009 the Turkish Military at Southern Turkey went after the Millions of Kurdistanis of PKK, HPG, KGK, Ansar Al Islam at Southern Turkey and Northern Iraq. The big mistake was not using the Turkish Special Forces to do Special Reconnaissance and Special Surveillance to determine the size of Kurdistanis Forces. After chasing the Millions (Majority of the Kurdistanis Population) into Northern Iraq, the Turkish Military encountered the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam that had been Trained, Armed and were being Funded by the Muslim Nation of Iran's Quds (Qods), funds of $Trillions (numbers from U.S. Department of State) from the Muslim's Mandatory Islamic Tithes from over 1.8 Billion Muslims Worldwide.The Majority of Kurdistanis belong to Ansar Al Islam as Allied to Osama Bin Laden, Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban (numbers from after CIA Operation Cyclone), Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam (numbers from 2001 U.S. Military Operation Viking Hammer). The Majority of Kurdistanis provided Osama Bin Laden, Al Quada, Millions of Afghan Taliban, and Holy Warriors of Islam 'Islamic Sanctuary' after being chased out of Afghanistan into Northern Iraq after the 2001 U.S. Overthrow of the Afghan Taliban Government. In 2007 President G.W. Bush had ordered the U.S. Special Operations Forces to shutdown the original Osama Bin Laden Muslim Terrorist Training Camps at Northern Yemen, this was accomplished 2008, with the Muslim Terrorist Training Camps then moved to the Kurdistanis Region of Northern Iraq.The Millions of Kurdistanis defeated the Turkish Military, while the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam, then fled back to their Nations of Origin to Overthrow U.S. Allies 'Established Governments' as the Democrat President Obama Approved 'Islamic Democracy Movement', starting with U.S. Ally President Mubarak of Egypt a U.S. Ally since 1973, then attacking from Egypt U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi a U.S. Ally since 2006, as Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah and the Millions of Holy Warriors of Islam needed the Decades of Weapons, Ammunition, Military Equipment, Anti Aircraft Missiles, Landmines, Explosives that were being used against the Holy Warriors of Islam by U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi's Libyan Military. After Democrat President Obama's Overthrows of U.S. Ally President Mubarak of Egypt, and U.S. Ally President Gaddaffi, Democrat President Obama's Supported Islamic Democracy Movement Egypt became Islamic State Egypt and Islamic State Sinai, at Libya Democrat President Obama's Non Libyan 'Libyan Rebels' of Al Quada's Ansar Al Shariah became Islamic State Libya, and then attacked U.S. Ally Tunisia.",8,4,24,7 August 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Shame on all of you applauding the Character Assassination of Starman
","All of you that never saw Starman 1984 should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing Stan Lee to do a Character Assassination of Chaotic Good (Too Good for own Benefit to Survive) Starman.This would be like Stan Lee writing a script for StarWars in that Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker murders the Evil Emperor, takes his place and becomes the Evil Emperor Luke Skywalker leading the Defeat of the Republic.Or Stan Lee writing a script for StarTrek, with Captain Kirk from within the Federation, Destroying the Federation and Federation Allies with some kind of 'Super Weapon'.Starman 1984 was like Classic The Day The Earth Stood Still 1951 as seen for the first time, the Audience did not know what to expect, after Decades of watching movies that had very hostile aliens trying to destroy Earth and enslave all Humans. Starman being Chaotic Good, did not understand the Human Concepts and Practice of Deceit, Lying, Treachery, Greed, Selfishness, Warmongering. And after already living Millions of Years, with Millions more to live would have already known (from previously attempting Conquest before) that Conquest of the Galaxy to become Ruler was counter productive, and that enhancing Human Knowledge and Evolution was the right and only thing to do.",1,14,32,7 August 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Factual
","Facts 1993 to 2001 Democrat President Clinton Destroyed the U.S. Defense (U.S. Military, U.S. Intelligence Agencies, U.S. Department of State (U.S. Defense Related Programs, like the U.S. Department of State's very Profitable Foreign Military Sales Program), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and many other U.S. Agencies U.S. Defense Related Programs). Democrat President Clinton 'Lost Osama Bin Laden' after the Osama Bin Laden 1993 First World Trade Center Attack.Worldwide the U.S. no longer Funded U.S. Funded 'Local' Intelligence Assets, that took Decades for the CIA to covertly Recruit (usually Citizens of the Target Nation), covertly Train, and covertly place into 'Hostile' Nations, 'Potentially Hostile' Nations, 'Anti U.S.' Nations, and some 'Friendly Nations' (Allied Nations).To Further Destroy U.S. Intelligence (that had been built up by Director of the CIA H.W. Bush, and as U.S. President H.W. Bush) Democrat President Clinton signed into U.S. Law his, No Intelligence Sharing Law, in that U.S. Agencies cannot 'Information Share' between U.S. Agencies nor with U.S. Allies Agencies. Translation the CIA could no longer 'Information Share' with the FBI, nor could the FBI 'Information Share' with the CIA. The CIA could no longer 'Information Share' with the Mossad, British Ministry of Intelligence (M.I.). 1998 Democrat President Declared War Against U.S. Ally Iraq, by Demanding U.S. Congress Declare War in his 1998 State of the Union Address 'Weapons of Mass Destruction', 'Dictator Iraqis President Saddam Hussein' (A Lie, British Style Parliamentary Form of Government), 'Murdering His Own People' (another Lie, the Millions of Shia of Iraq (Iranians, that fled Iran after the 1979 U.S.S.R. backed Overthrow of U.S. Ally Shah of Iran), and the Millions of Kurdistanis as Allied to the Muslim Nation of Iran are NOT Actual Iraqis (Arabs, Sunnis), and actually fought against the Actual Iraqis during the Iran Iraq Wars 1980 to 1989 as the Longest Conventional War of History). The Result was the U.S. House of Representatives Declaration of War Against U.S. Ally Iraq, 'Iraq Liberation Act of 1998' as the Democrat's 'Overthrow of Iraqis President Saddam Hussein, Liberate the Iraqis People, Install A Democracy'. This was then followed by Democrat President Clinton's Ordered as Commander In Chief 1998 U.S. Military Operation Desert Fox, as more intensive U.S. Airstrikes and U.S. Cruise Missile Attacks against the Muslims at Baghdad U.S. Ally Iraq, Democrat President Clinton's mistaken ignorant belief that by attacking the Civilians at the Overcrowded Urban Poor Areas of Baghdad Iraq, they would Revolt against 'Dictator' Iraqis President Saddam Hussein, Muslims do not play that kind of games and directly blamed those that attacked them, 'U.S. The Great Satan', a hundreds of thousands of Innocent Muslim Men, Women, and Lots (too many) Children were Murdered. To Gain Support for Himself, his Al Quada,Osama Bin Laden Declared Revenge for the Murders of the Innocent Poor of Islam, the Muslim Nation of Iran then backed Osama Bin Laden and so did most of the over 1.5 Billion Muslims Worldwide, money from the Mandatory Islamic Tithes from the over 1.5 Billion Muslims Worldwide flowed into Osama Bin Laden's and his Al Quada's pockets.Translation, That's Correct Democrat President Clinton was the CAUSE of the 1993 Osama Bin Laden First World Trade Center Attack, and the Second Osama Bin Laden World Trade Center Attack as the 9/11 2001 Attacks. Just like Democrat President Clinton CAUSED the 2008 Great Recession, by Eliminating the U.S. Laws, Banking Acts of 1933 and 1935, and having Amended the Community Reinvestment Act to cause the Mortgage Crisis, Destruction of the U.S. Defense also caused the Recession of 1998.CIA Operation Neptune Spear After the Osama Bin Laden Second Attack of the World Trade Center, as the 9/11 2001 Attacks, Republican President G.W. Bush tasked the CIA to create a Plan to Locate and Capture Osama Bin Laden. U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant General McChrystal and U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. Admiral McRaven wrote CIA Operation Neptune Spear. Within weeks after the 9/11 2001 Attacks the CIA with attached U.S. Army Special Forces attempted CIA Operation Neptune Spear and Failed due to Democrat President Clinton's 1993 to 2001 Destruction of the U.S. Defense, the U.S. no longer Funded U.S. Local Afghan Intelligence Assets to assist the CIA Teams to get to 'Safe Houses (Locations)', evade the Millions of Afghan Taliban, Locate Osama Bin Laden in a Nation the size of Texas with 2/3rds being Mountains.Democrat President Obama fearing a Failure that would destroy his Political Career (Re Election) 'Politically Distanced' himself (again), so the Director of the CIA, Leon Panetta, using the Republican President G.W. Bush Presidential Executive Orders, CIA Operation Neptune Spear, G.W. Bush 2006 Amended U.S. No Assassination Policy, conducted CIA Operation Neptune Spear from a CIA SCIF, not the White House that was only full of spectators.This is NOT a matter of likes or dislikes this is Facts of Actual Written U.S. Laws, U.S. Government Documents, U.S. Congressional Records.",9,1,3,13 August 2017
