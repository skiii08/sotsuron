Hereditary," Worth the wait
","The movie is slow. A lot of people have issue with exactly how slow it is, but in my opinion it adds to the entire feel of the movie by how slowly everything builds up. There are plenty of clues throughout the movie that hint at what is really happening if you pay attention and be sure to keep an eye out for smiling man.Although you could argue that the end is rather rushed it all comes together beautifully.",8,0,2,9 February 2019
The Babadook," I can't believe I waited so long to watch this
","CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS I put off watching this due to how many bad reviews I saw and how many people I came across that had nothing to say about it other than to mock it. But I finally sat down to watch it while answering some emails and quickly found the emails completely forgotten.This isn't a jump and scare type of horror, and I personally found the times the Babadook was crawling around a bit funny. If you base the movie off of him alone it looks like another sorta bad sorta funny horror. The children's book was scarily adorable and I want it, and I've found myself walking around the house saying, 'Ba ba dook dook dook,' all night.That all alone made it an okay movie. But what made it good was every other bit. The way he lurks in the shadows always had you nervous every time there was a dark corner. The way the little boy annoys the hell out of you at first then wins you over with how pathetic he is. It nearly broke my heart when he was trying to tell his mommy he was hungry and there was no food in the fridge. The way friends and family react to them is so uncomfortable and just really gets you into the story. The mother takes every idea of depression you can have and plays them beautifully. The real story and the real horror is the relationship between them and the lows it reaches at times. I feel like they could have gone more into detail with certain bits, like the home visit that ended so quickly. The ending had a bit of a twist but still left you uneasy and rather sad for everyone the entire time.Well worth the watch even if the dinosaur noises were a bit distracting.",8,3,5,13 January 2017
