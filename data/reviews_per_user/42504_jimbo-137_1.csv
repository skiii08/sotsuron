The Blair Witch Project," Amazed by the simple intensity of the movie
","I saw this film weeks after it's initial release, as the hype has died down, and it's made it's way to more theaters.I wasn't sure what to expect, as I only caught parts of the TV special 'Curse of the Blair Witch', but I was struck by the sheer simplicity of the film.The media, 8mm tape and 16mm celluloid film were used to provide the imagery ultimately brought to the big screen, and added tremendously to the overall impression.The use of unknown actors/actresses is hugely effective in giving the impression that the story is real, and the -only- indication that the film is fictitious is the standard disclaimer at the end, stating that 'any resemblance to actual persons or events is purely coincidental'.The only solid evidence I have found to indicate this film is fiction is the fact one of the cast members will appear in (3) additional films in the next 12-15 months.That would be impossible if the events in the film had been real.  I won't place the spoiler here of which cast member this is.  You'll just have to find our for yourselves.Enjoy this scary film, and remember, the only -real- witches are earth-mother following holistic healers.",Null,0,1,19 September 1999
