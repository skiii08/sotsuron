Requiem for a Dream," Haunting and memorable
","A haunting and stunning masterpiece-This film should be shown to teenagers in health ed class; I will certainly force my son to view it once he is 14 or 15. I will guarantee you anyone who does will NEVER experiment with dangerous, powerful drugs. This film delivers on every level until the gut-wrenching climax leaving you horrified; saddened and a bit sick. If you can stomach it; it is a masterpiece of abuse and the human condition. The individual performances are all amazing and Jennifer Connelly is at her most beautiful best. The visuals are equally impressive; whether you are sober or not. It is amazing although not unbelievable at all; the lengths humans will sink to realized here.",10,0,0,23 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Very Well done; does not replace Nicholson
","Easy hype-machine due to Ledger's passing; this film is not better overall than the original Batman starring Keaton and Nicholson who both will forever be the perfect Batman and Joker character portrayals. Ledger and Bale are great and this film entertains every step of the way. However; Ledger comes off sounding a bit weak with his high pitched-squeaky voice and he certainly isn't as darkly humorous as Jack was. He doesn't even have memorable lines-recall 'This town needs an enema/Stop the press; who is that/Where does he get those wonderful toys?' Sorry young kids, this film is not the #1 rated movie of all time and isn't even close. Superior to Batman Begins for sure but Ironman is 2008's stronger film.",8,5,10,23 July 2008
