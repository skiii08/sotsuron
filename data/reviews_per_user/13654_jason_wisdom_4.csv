Miracle," Almost a masterpiece
","I really, really like this movie. Except for the parts that, upon re-watching years later, are annoying or just inaccurate. First, the positive. The inspiration / miracle factor, comes through in spades. Kurt Russell is great as the mean yet human after all coach Herb Brooks. This movie depicts the formation of teamwork, real camaraderie, and overcoming early reactions to the Soviet team with visceral emotion and life. The opening narrative was one of the most powerful setting-establishers I have seen. The movie is nearly as inspiring as watching the game itself (which is perhaps the best sports match ever, Rocky eat your heart out). I really wanted to rate this a 10.I wish this movie would have stayed more consistent with how the story played out in real life. The story was incredible enough that events didn't need to be over dramatized, exaggerated or downright falsified. I can't go into details without revealing spoilers, but they are easy to find with minimal googling. I also wish this movie had more profanity. With the intensity of emotions that existed...I understand it is Disney, but Coach Herb is said to have used very strong language at times, and watering his tongue down did not help the storyline. Lastly, there was way too much stick-to-wall-thumping at the end, and not enough showing the hockey game. The first viewing I didn't notice, or mind, but upon re-watching, I asked myself, 'Were so many cut-scenes of the same kind of bench reaction really necessary?'This movie had a je ne sais quoi about it that really sets it apart from most of Hollywood. Miracle on Ice is probably one of America's proudest and most triumphant moments in her history. This movie really captures that feeling. I just think that with some better editing, less exaggeration of certain aspects (Jim Craig was great but not THAT amazing), and not watering down strong tongues who lashed out, this could have been a truly perfect 10 film.",9,1,1,7 July 2016
Us," Good, not great
","Pros: Good acting especially by the star, some good sequences and efforts by all
actors, an original storyline, and the significant & unexpected twist at the end makes me want to see the whole movie again (will wait for Netflix or Amazon Prime).Cons: Plot holes are an understatement. Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, a logistically un-believable backstory is quite another. Without going into spoilers, the DNA element alone is mathematically impossible. Then figure travel, international immigration factoring into a supposedly US-based phenomenon...these matter a lot. The script straddles the two cliffs of ambiguity and depth, doing neither one very well. The morality is not thought through, and there is no real message.Neutral: What is with all of these 1 star reviews, saying horrible without any explanation. Why was it boring, hilarious in the bad way, terrible?",6,3,4,14 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Great except for all of the SJW hijacking
","I really, liked this film. Better than TFA, and maybe as much as Return of the Jedi.Two complaints: One, Rian Johnson seems to create shock changes just for the sake of creating shock changes. It's bad storytelling.Two, and much more serious, is how Social Justice Warriors have completely taken over the Star Wars Universe.There is not one single Resistance man who is a positively strong character leader in the movie. One man is a hotshot loose cannon that gets put in his place and is basically emasculated for the rest of the film, another is a flake who forgets where his heart was as soon as another opportunity presents itself, and the anticipated leader of them all is actually a cynical, defeated, regretful man. Meanwhile, there are plenty of positively strong character women, leading with integrity, conviction, confidence, determination... Again, I LIKED this movie. A lot. Love Rey and Kylo's character developments. Also thought it was Mark Hamill's best movie ever. But Disney, please, drop the men-are-the-patriarchy-which-must-be-overthrown-so-a-new-matriarchy-may-rise narrative, will you? It got old before the last movie finished.",6,3,11,12 September 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Ambitious but cheesy
","The Avengers was a fantastic movie in so many ways. This, its sequel, tried too hard and its character development in dialogue was too thin, much like X-men 3. Some deleted scenes, even as minor as the 4-5 seconds that were cut, did a lot to explain some gaping plot holes. Some of the virtuous-boy-next-door lines by the stars seemed more appropriate for a group called The Partridge Family and not a group of lethal outcasts banding together to wage war and calling themselves The Avengers. Special effects were nice, and certain fight scenes were nice. This film is not bad. But this film lacks substance.",5,3,8,3 April 2016
