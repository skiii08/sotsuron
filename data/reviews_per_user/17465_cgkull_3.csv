The Perks of Being a Wallflower," These Are The Perks
","I went into this film not having read the book and not knowing anything about the plot. And while I do not condone anyone that read the book, I was so pleased with all of the surprises that opened up as the movie progressed. 'Perks' has it all. It pulls and twists at every awkward emotion teenagers have felt through the treacherous time that is high school. There are times of anguish, sadness, glory, revenge, love, depression, futility, etc. So many times you just wanted to jump in and tell poor Charlie that things would turn out alright. His relationship naivety and blatant honesty made him such an intriguing individual, that you could not help but root for him.Most high school films are cheesy and the clichés are overpowering, but 'Perks' stayed truly original from the party scenes to the lunchroom antics. It paid dividends that the author, Stephen Chbosky, was able to take his vision in his novel and portray that on screen exactly how he wanted. The storyline was patient and the pace moved perfectly to keep me thoroughly entertained throughout.Though Emma Watson may be the high-profile name in the cast, it was Logan Lerman stealing the show. Remember his name. He took the innocent- freshman-with-a-mysteriously-broken-past-just-trying-to-fit-in and ran with it so well, I forgot that he is actually 20 years old. Ezra Miller also played a great compliment as Charlie's confidante and best friend, and Watson added some enticing flair as the love interest. I cannot wait to buy this DVD when it comes out and watch it for years to come, for as high school movies go, this one is as timeless and truthful as they come.",9,2,4,11 October 2012
Ted," Review of Ted
","I admit, I went into this movie with very high expectations because I love Seth MacFarlane and his ability to bring non-humans a human-like quality has proved to be comedic genius in the past. However, this movie fell short of what I had hoped it would be. The character of Ted, and the story of how he came to be living and accepted in the normal world was intricate and enticing, but it's Mark Wahlberg that really brought the movie back a few notches. With most raunchy comedies (Pineapple Express, Hangover, Superbad), even if the main character is a total screw up, he is lovable to where you are rooting for him to succeed eventually. This movie made me resent Wahlberg's character to the point where I believed he deserved all the trouble he'd gotten into and hoped he never got out. His delivery of most lines were cheesy aside from the quick draw of female names from the trailer. In fact, if it weren't for Mila Kunis as the saving grace, I would probably want my money back. Granted, Ted has some laugh out loud moments and adds some shock value as only MacFarlane can possess, but the overall picture lacked the staying power of what a true comedy movie should embody. I might watch this again down the road, but it is not near the first movie I would grab when I need a laugh on a random afternoon.",6,1,2,21 December 2012
500 Days of Summer," Frustrating, yet Intriguing
","After finishing (500) days of summer, I originally left the movie theater with a bad taste in my mouth. However, the more I thought about it, the more intriguing this movie became.Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's on screen back-and-forth relationship is the most believable chemistry I have seen by two people in any movie in recent years. Towards the end, the expectations in the audience are high that they'll end up together, and the fact that they don't may disappoint some, but it adds to the reality of the film.Tom's frustration over Summer is a feeling that many have felt throughout their lives when their hearts are crushed for reasons beyond them. The writing is smart, the plot is gripping, and Marc Webb's directing is fantastically original. (especially in the split screen 'expectation' scene) This is one of those movies where you leave the theater and talk about it, then go bed, and think about it, then wake up, and think about it. It sticks with you for days, and will have you rethink the traditional romantic comedy style that has been so cliché in recent years.",9,0,2,25 August 2009
