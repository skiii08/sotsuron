Whip It," Fantastic, Feel Good Film.
","I only happened to catch this film at an Ellen Page special movie night at a local art's program centre. Definitely one of my favourite films of all time now. I mean, Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Marcia Gay Harden and Zoe Bell all in one film? Its like an explosion of talent which created this memorable masterpiece. Drew Barrymore deserves a standing ovation for her directorial debut, and i'm praying she keeps going. I certainly have a soft spot for Ellen Page. Since i saw her in 'Hard Candy' and 'Juno', i've been intrigued in the work she chooses, and her role as Bliss was just perfect. A total indie rock chick by day, who works at the goofy but classic 'Oink Joint' and wears a piggy apron. But by night she transforms into roller derby sensation Babe Ruthless, surrounded by the equally amazing 'Hurl Scout' team. It portrays the average mother/daughter conflict that most go through well. Both have different ideas regarding Bliss' future; Her mom wanting her to compete in Pagaents while Bliss wants to get out of Bodeen, Texas and get herself a life. Differences which in the end reunites them together. The soundtrack is fab, fab, fab. Such a mixture; from Dolly Parton to Kings of Leon to Jens Lekman. And each suited the scene so well. I don't think this film has an age or sex limit. I think everyone can enjoy it and get something different out of it. It also makes you feel DAMN good! Had me smiling and laughing the whole way through. It's a full on, rockin, girl power film that all will love. Drew Barrymore and Ellen Page? I applaud you both for a magnificent film which i without a doubt will be purchasing.",10,1,5,15 August 2010
Sucker Punch," Loved it.
","Not the best film I've ever seen but certainly a very good one. Caught this movie with a couple of friends and at the end we all had very opposite opinions. I thought it was entertaining, fresh and different while another told me 20 mins in that they thought it sucked. I think you have to like this style of film in order to appreciate what it is. I was honestly confused at times, not quite keeping up with what world they were in (inception-esque) but it was a fixation and even quite shocking at points - eg. when Amber and Blondie get shot in the head - I did not see that coming at all and pretty much the whole cinema let out a yelp. Whether or not you enjoyed this film, i think everyone can agree that the soundtrack is just outstanding. There was so much going on in the film, all the action, fighting, dancing, plotting and the music was fitted so perfectly. Loved finding out that Emily Browing sung a couple of them; especially the stunning 'Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This' in the opening of the film which was breathtaking and very well filmed which definitely set a high standard for the rest of the film.I think everyone should see this movie regardless of whether you normally watch this genre of film because it was fresh and something new and you may find that you actually do enjoy it. Even so, make sure you check out the soundtrack - it's a winner.",8,3,8,16 April 2011
Inception," Definitely One To Watch.
","I'm not usually one for giving a 10 out of 10 mark, but having seen Inception three times, i can definitely say it deserves full marks. Having read the reviews on here, i've decided i'm not going to write a synopsis since almost every other review has at least a simple summary. Many are a saying Inception was just boring; the characters didn't mesh well; it had so much potential; too much going on; too long; how can it be 3'd best film ever, yada yada yada. I don't agree with any in the slightest. If you found it boring, then you didn't grasp the whole concept of the movie and the ideas it brought up.I first saw the trailer back in early July, was immediately intrigued but went on holiday for 2 weeks. As i came back i learned it had been on the Twitter trending topics the whole time i was away, so i decided indefinitely that it was time i went and saw it myself. Having read an extremely short synopsis saying 'The film follows a man who steals, not material objects, but ideas and dreams', i didn't know what to expect. But it was more then i had ever imagined it to be.Not once did i look at my watch whilst in the screening. And if i did, it was because i was checking how much longer was left as i didn't want it to end. The story i personally think is simple. It doesn't take a genius to work it out. But its the intelligence within it that's released from the the characters that make it what it is. Graphics are brilliant, especially with buildings exploding here and there in slow motion. Not over the top but without a doubt satisfying.I do have a soft spot for Ellen Page. Since i saw her in 'Hard Candy', i've been intrigued in the work she chooses. She was beyond perfect for the role of Ariadne; an innocent, dedicated student who definitely helps the audience out with questions that needed answering. Leonardo DiCaprio, perfection in all it's glory. Perfect choice for Dom. The cast as a whole was well put together. They each make their role their own. I wouldn't have chosen any better in all honesty.But i can write as much as i want trying to persuade you to give this movie a chance regardless of some mindless people's reviews. But the decision does ultimately lie on your shoulders. Whether or not you think you may enjoy this movie, i would give it a go in any case. You may be pleasantly surprised.I adored the soundtrack to this movie. All orchestrated. Pure brilliance. The impact it made on each scene was astounding. I highly, highly, highly recommend you listen to it whether you decide to watch the movie or not.I don't think i can create a review that sums up it's impact it had on me. I could sit here and write all day how brilliant i thought it was and talk about every minute detail that engrossed me, but then i would be here all week. How do i bring this to a end though... An eventful, non-stop, intelligent, incredible, jaw-droppingly, engrossing film, with an ending that will leave you pulling your hair out and wanting more. This is how i'd describe it. I do hope that they leave it at one Inception though. Making a second one would ruin it entirely for me. It's always a tragic mistake.I must also add that it took me three viewings to finally suss out all the characters names! Complicated in that aspect.",10,2,6,14 August 2010
