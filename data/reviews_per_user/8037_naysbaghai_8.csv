The Lobster," A quirky and playful yet despicable comedy
","I never really thought about how film has the power to translate extreme theatrical styles and ideas onto the big screen, until I watched The Lobster. Borrowing heavily from Absurdism, this science fiction artwork from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos is disguised as a quirky and playful yet despicable comedy that presents a relevant commentary on relationships in the world in which we live. It does so in an original fashion that is becoming exceedingly rare in modern cinema.Let's place ourselves in the familiar situation of the not-too distant dystopian future, and imagine that we are imprisoned in a remote hotel, and if we fail to find a suitable romantic partner in 45 days, we are turned into an animal of our own choosing. This is an idea that sounds both interesting and frightening at the same time, but is without doubt innovative, as is the rest of the narrative. The plot is unpredictable and expertly paced, and balances moments of shock and anguish with spasms of rupturing laughter. If I mention any in this review, I will have made the same mistake as the movie's trailer did, and that is reveal too much of the film. What the trailer doesn't reveal is the enormous complexity of the film's message; neither side (being in a relationship versus being single) is an ideal side, and that the real nature of society is not restricted to black and white. For a film with a budget of just over $8 million, the film boasts an ensemble cast that takes the wheel of this film with little effort. The residents at the hotel include Ben Winshaw (Skyfall and Perfume) and John C. Reilly (Step Brothers and Guardians of the Galaxy), while the rebels hiding in the woods include Léa Seydoux (Spectre and Mission Impossible IV) and Rachel Weisz (The Mummy and The Fountain). Most of these unnamed characters support the protagonist David, played by an unrecognisable Colin Farrell, whose character development propels the film even further.In terms of execution, the cinematography is exquisitely composed, and is complemented by the bleak colour palette. Returning to the sci-fi features of the film, I applaud Lanthimos's choice to employ normal locations such as hotels, woods and cities to show how the possibility of a dystopian future is very real and very imminent. However, I feel that he may have indulged too heavily in the usage of slow-motion, and the recurrence of the same piece of music quickly wore out its welcome. Upon further reflection, this technique not only symbolises the cyclical nature of the world portrayed in the film, but dodges a few of nasty entanglements associated with copyrighted music. Overall, The Lobster, while undoubtedly eccentric and esoteric, was quite enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Having seen it in the cinema, I was initially confounded as to how many people (mostly contumelious seniors) complained about it and/or walked out. However, that did not ruin my own experience of watching the film; a sign of a very good film.",9,4,13,12 December 2015
Black Mass," A modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast
","I've learned that anticipation can occasionally be the enemy of awareness, a lesson that I discovered while watching Black Mass. As a member of the film nerd mafia, I desperately wanted this film to answer one buzzing question - does Johnny Depp still possess the acting chops he held prior to Pirates of the Caribbean? It doesn't matter if you've seen the movie or not, because the answer is dead obvious: yes.Depp shines as James 'Whitey' Bulger (or Jimmy, as we are encouraged to call him), an unpredictable and ice-cold gangster who prowls the waters of the story like a great white shark, manifesting his fearless and violent nature at the sign of any given threat. As he dives into the depths of this real-life Boston gangster, he is completely unrecognisable and genuinely frightening, receiving assistance from the talented makeup artists of this film. While this film is designed as a vehicle for Johnny Depp, the ensemble cast further seduces you to go see the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch and Joel Edgerton morph into their roles as Jimmy's allies, while Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott perfectly suit their roles as detectives from the 70s. It goes without saying that the cast is what drives the power of the film.The film, however, does suffer from a weak screenplay that fails to maintain the interest it should. While the film had a strong start and established the characters effectively, the second act mysteriously lacked the tension and controlled pacing that was present in the first thirty minutes. While the premise of a gangster who allies with the FBI to strengthen is own power is genuinely interesting, the film reminded me how movies that are 'based on a true story' should be treated with caution. The other noteworthy, and perhaps admirable, element of Black Mass is its unapologetic tribute to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The intersection between criminal activity, family life and the ever-looming threat of the FBI all tread familiar territory, while the values of integrity, camaraderie and fortitude make the film feel like a modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast. While I might question Black Mass's decision not to use contemporary music, I should remind myself of the never-ending difficulties imposed by music copyright. Although I feel like a bit of a nitpicker, I am happy to crown Black Mass as Johnny Depp's absolution from shoddy filmmaking, even if the story fails to match the depth of its cast.",7,1,1,24 October 2015
American Psycho," Unearthly brutal and outright confronting
","2000 is commonly regarded as one of the best years in cinema, but none of the films that year were as unearthly brutal and outright confronting as the hybrid opus American Psycho. Predominantly constructed as a psychological thriller, this film should rank high on anyone's 'most disturbing' film list, but as a reviewer, my catharsis from such unsettling sights was the breadth in technique and execution.The opening credits exhibit what separates good opening titles from great ones, and that is the usage of foreshadowing. Everything, from the exquisite dishes to the slashing knife, and even the elegant font, is representative of the future events in the film. As an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, the poetic passages and smooth dialogue are effortlessly translated onto film, further signifying Mary Hellon's subtlety and neutrality in her direction. Her clinical style of direction is particularly showcased when she edits Detective Kimball's interview scene from various performance takes to deliberately confuse audiences in regards to Kimball's thoughts.The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast featuring Willem Defoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Justin Theroux. As talented as all the actors in the film are, none hold up to the irrepressible Christian Bale, whose penchant for method acting is in full blossom. By spending hours in the gym and maintaining an American accent, he truly does morph into the role of a truly twisted and sick son of a bitch. He is flanked by symbols such as cigars, expensive materials and facial masks, highlighting the film's smart investigation into the hedonistic upper class. American Psycho is undoubtedly objective and cold, and forces the audience to decide on their own personal views of the human world.A large percentage of the film's budget is devoted to a soundtrack full of classic 80s hits, like Walking On Sunshine, Simply Irresistible and Lady In Red. Ultimately, the most iconic usage of music in this film is when Hip To Be Square, by Huey Lewis and the News, is cranked up as Bateman viciously murders Paul Allen with a fire axe. As a film addict, I realised how the sign of a good movie is when it synchronises a famous piece of music to the scene, and perpetually associates the two in your synapses. Speaking of which, Bateman's behaviour and violence is enormously disturbing, and is the primary reason why American Psycho is really only for adults. I learned that a sign of adulthood is not the tolerance of an R18+ movie, but rather the bravery to object to senseless violence. It's hard not to be enticed by the techniques and performances, but if you find yourself undisturbed by the content of this film, then, to quote Reese Witherspoon's character, 'you're inhuman'.",9,1,2,12 December 2015
Gone Girl," An enthralling and incredibly cerebral experience
","Watching Gone Girl late at night might have been a foolish choice, but that has not prevented it from being one of my favourite movies of 2014. There are so many reasons Gone Girl is a clever film, it's difficult to condense it into one review. First off, David Fincher has proved himself to be one of the best living directors today, and from now on, I will mention him in the same breath as directors like Scorsese, Spielberg, Nolan and Tarantino. Fincher knows the importance of all the elements of filmmaking (ie storytelling, suspense, mise-en-scene, editing) and demonstrates his understanding in his adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel. The entire experience is an enthralling and incredibly cerebral one, and messes with you throughout. The movie is especially enhanced by the performances of Ben Affleck, Tyler Perry (who is actually really funny) and particularly Rosamund Pike.Despite the laborious two hour thirty minute runtime, overall, I was quite pleased with this film, and I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a thriller with an array of killer twists and turns!",9,0,1,15 October 2015
Three Colors: Blue," A cerebral, poetic and misty experience
","I don't think I can emphasise how much I adore world cinema, an innocent pleasure vindicated by the 1993 French film Three Colours: Blue. Starring Juliette Binoche, the film treats us to a dreamy snapshot into human remembrance and existence, forcing us to meditate on our own experiences of life. The intelligence and reverie that Three Colours: Blue exhibits should convince anyone how world cinema, dare I say it, is superior to most of the films produced by Hollywood these days.Although I hate the fact that years of English and Drama studies have hardwired my brain to view everything as symbolically as possible, I will admit that the emblems and symbols presented in the film are simply astounding. What is particularly enticing is director Krzysztof Kieślowski's ability to utilise symbols in not only objects and locations, but in film techniques as well. The smooth tripod movements and natural lighting emphasise our stability as observers of Julie's story. I don't intend to bore you with the multitude of symbols in this film, but I will mention perhaps one of the most memorable scenes in the film. As Julie swims through the ghostly blue waters of the pool, her introspection brings her to one of the core messages of the film - no matter how hard we try to suppress bad memories, we are inevitably confronted and challenged by our past.Now, allow me to examine the story without a gratuitous analysis of symbolism that could make me sound all too posh. I think the film has a strong opening that is laden with mystery and coldness that conveys how we are both observers and participants of the narrative. Julie's journey throughout Paris brought me back a feast of memories, ranging from the solitude within cafés, to inhaling the sights and sounds of Parisan streets, and ascending through the labyrinthine staircases of apartments. I should also mention that the relationship between the story and soundtrack cleverly represents the various psychological states of Julie, with the lonely piano phrases emphasising her isolation, while the pan-flute of the busker symbolises the mystery surrounding life. Although I applaud the filmmakers' exploration of issues such as solitude and suicide, the biggest let-down for me was the fact that the film had a slow pace despite its 94 minute runtime. However, if you consider yourself to be a patient movie goer, this shouldn't be an issue for you. Despite this small crack in the armour, I was impressed with the cerebral, poetic and misty experience of watching Three Colours: Blue, and I found it to be a good film to end the week with.",9,0,0,12 December 2015
Paths of Glory," A multilayered and candid portrait of war
","The expression 'two for one' summarises my experience of Stanley Kubrick's anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory, a work from a cinematic maestro examining the multitude of issues that plagued World War I. Sure, the film is a great history lesson, but it also highlights the origins of Kubrick's directorial style, and how it has also educated cinema for the last 58 years in a profound way. In the words of Steven Spielberg, 'when you look at Paths of Glory, every sequence hammers its points home, but within every sequence, the filmmaking is delicate, subtle and gentle almost.'Before Kubrick's idiosyncratic and perfectionist nature was highlighted in his later works, such as The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut, the subtlety, perception and imperturbability he applied to his direction is in full bloom. We are constantly reminded how we are observers to the tragedy of events, instanced by the going-over-the-top scenes and arguments between Kirk Douglas' Colonel Dax and the pompous generals. The impeccable composition and lighting of the cinematography highlights Kubrick's undying attention to technicality, and also sheds light on the influence of his background in photography.However, the sound design of the film is particularly enticing, with the rhythms of machine gun fire and legatos of whistles providing a haunting soundtrack in its own right. When actual music does occur, the symbolism is retained, as shown by the mocking juxtaposition between snare drum ostinatos and marching generals. I'm sure that I'm not alone in my view that Stanley Kubrick is the director to learn from when it comes down to solely technique.Although the dialogue in Paths of Glory tends to be wearisome and slowly articulated, I should remind myself that the film does depict the prosaic nature of war, and that we are observers of the events, be they snappy or sluggish. The story touches on a wide variety of topics surrounding the Allied war effort, including the persuasive yet delusional behaviour of the generals and the suicidal nature of trench warfare. However, what separates Paths of Glory from other war films is its ability to simultaneously examine law and justice, and therefore bolster its educational power. Although Paths of Glory is an unconcealed constituent from the Criterion Collection, evidenced by its artistic, symbolic and periodic features, it is nonetheless a multilayered and candid portrait of war that still maintains its relevance and watchability almost six decades from its release. It's easy to see how both history documentaries and other film directors have tried and failed to replicate the work of the integral film genius known as Stanley Kubrick.",9,0,3,12 December 2015
Straight Outta Compton," A hardcore and truthful story
","My fascination with rap artists like NWA has been reignited for good by the highly anticipated Straight Outta Compton, which promised to deliver a hardcore and truthful story of one of the most well-known rap groups of all time. My expectations generated by the trailer were not let down, with F. Gary Gray's memorable biopic hitting on all the elements, including the iconic rap numbers, police brutality, and the personal lives of the rappers.The principal strength of Straight Outta Compton is its sporadic portrayal of scenes that add to the historicity of the film. The rapping scenes are cool and drive the energetic nature of the film, forcing you to bob your head to the beat, or in my case, rap along to the lyrics. We are subtly reminded of the notion that 'our art is a reflection of our reality', and fortunately, the message doesn't wear out its welcome.The scenes in which the police arrest the rappers for no good reason are portrayed in a grizzly and spine-chilling fashion, especially if you consider how police brutality continues to stain American society. However, in a similar fashion, one of the most memorable scenes for me personally, is when Ice Cube demolishes Bryan's office, enraged that he has not been paid his money, yet despite this barbaric act, Bryan still operates as Cube's manager. Holding my breath as the scene unfolded, I was jolted not only by the foreshadowing of Jerry Heller's deviousness, but how the unscrupulous nature of the music distribution/copyright industry is an alarming reality. Speaking of Ice Cube, the decision to cast O'Shea Jackson Jr. as his own father was a decision that paid off immensely, as the actor brings an enormous amount of veracity to his character you don't often find in cinema. While the story and ideas of Straight Outta Compton are interesting, there a few flaws hidden in the script's nooks and crannies. In addition to the worrisome runtime (2 hours 30 minutes), the engagement starts to dwindle during the more monotonous conversations. I also feel like the whole subplot of Eazy-E dying of HIV received too much attention, with its sentimental tonality betraying the passion that is present in the first half. Although the editing makes you feel like a participant in the conversations, the overall cut of the film feels like a tender, well cooked rack of lamb that still has a bit of fat that could have been trimmed off. While the filmmakers' difficulty in achieving a steady pace is noticeable, the themes, characterisation and historical weight more than compensate for that, cementing its reputation as one of the best rap films history has seen so far.",7,2,26,12 December 2015
Spectre," Enormously fun
","When a highly anticipated blockbuster is around the corner, I inevitably find myself prowling the cinema in order to unearth the truth for myself. Spectre was my second most anticipated movie of 2015, narrowly beaten by Star Wars: The Force Awakens, with trailers that indicated that this would be a great movie. My decision to ignore the 'mixed or average reviews' of Spectre was a move that paid off, considering how great my experience with this film was.Considering how awesome and fun the film is, there are only a few negatives to point out. Sam Smith's title song is abysmal and on par with some of the songs from the Roger Moore Era. In addition to the minimal appearance of Monica Belluci's character, I was really disappointed by the handling of Oscar winner Christoph Waltz in the role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Although Waltz gives a performance akin to his role in Inglorious Basterds, he is let down by weak dialogue. As summed by Bond, 'the only thing more painful than torture is listening to you talk'.However, most of these flaws are quite forgivable, as the the overall story and script of Spectre is surprisingly great. I disagree with the assertion that the script is a huge letdown; I found it to be concise, eloquent and humorous. What elevates Spectre is its ability to balance its gritty action and tone with genuinely humorous repartee. The most memorable punchline is when C, played by Andrew Scott (who borrows from his performance as Moriarty in Sherlock), states that 'M stands for Moron', to which Ralph Fiennes' character responds, 'Now we know what C stands for'. In addition to his ability to have fun, Sam Mendes' clever direction is also evidenced by his aptitude in achieving great performances, symbolism and a smooth round-the-world tour. I should also mention that Spectre is the jackpot of nods to almost every previous entry in the Bond canon, and handles all these references in an intelligent fashion.As far as performances go, Daniel Craig never disappoints in the role of 007, and brings out the humour, acumen and vulnerability that none of the previous Bonds have been able to achieve. His support trio (M, Q and Moneypenny) are at their best, especially when they all work as a team to aid Bond in the final act. Dr. Madeline Swann, played by the irrepressible Léa Seydoux, is sexy, smart, sassy, and everything a great Bond girl should be, while simultaneously bringing raw emotion and complexity that makes her an overall strong character, regardless of her gender. One of the most memorable characters in the film is Mr. Hinx, played by Dave Bautista, fresh off Guardians of the Galaxy. Although he is clearly a modern-day Oddjob, he also reminds us of the T-800, with his brutish penchant for violence complemented by his silence, striking fear into the hearts of both Bond and the audience.Exquisitely shot by Interstellar cinematographer Hoyte van Hoteyma, the visual representation of the action and drama in Spectre is close to perfection. The opening tracking shot throughout Mexico City is so bloody brilliant, that if CinemaSins were reviewing this film, they would remove several sins just for that one shot. The action in Spectre is enormously fun, and makes great usage of its $300 million budget. I'm not sure if Spectre is better than Casino Royale or even Skyfall, but it is supremely better than Quantum of Solace. Considering how much of a ball I had while watching the film, this film ranks high on my list of films that critics got wrong.",7,3,9,12 December 2015
