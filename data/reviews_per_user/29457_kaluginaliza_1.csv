Catch Me If You Can," Catch me if you can
","Mouse in the bankThe film is based on the book of this Frank Abignale (which did not really control the filming process of director Steven Spielberg) - it came out a bitter tragicomedy about human vices and cynicism. Frank Abignale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) - a master of deception and cheating, who managed to work and the chief physician and pilot of passenger airlines, and assistant prosecutor - and all this to 21, and certainly, with the help of youthful seductiveness, and a small chain, which 'allegedly' lost many employees. In the film, one can see the unconditional 'influence' of his father, whose 'rules of life' he brought to 'unprecedented heights', and his prayer before dinner in his future wife's house was a story about a mouse: 'Two mice fell into a vessel with milk. One mouse - did not resist, and sank. The other one floundered for a long time, whipped up butter, and climbed to the surface. ' In this story - he is undoubtedly the second mouse. The parents' divorce became the 'catalyst' of all his actions, where he masterfully falsified bank checks in his name, promised unprecedented profits to his father (remembering his mother - just before arrest, when he saw her juvenile daughter in another family through the window), and in the end, over time, became the most valuable employee of the FBI in the field of fraud. The story of such a 'non-standard' hero - under the leadership of Steven Spielberg - came out in a very voluminous, dramatic ode about inhuman gain, human weakness and short-sighted, where it seems 'you can get the moon'.",10,1,2,19 February 2019
