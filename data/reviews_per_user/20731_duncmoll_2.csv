Casablanca," Dated, pre-war drivel
","First, the cast - full of those annoying 'comic-relief' that studios stuck in every movie from the 30's. Yes, I said the 30's, because Casablanca is much more a product of that decade than the 40's, which would deliver some truly great films. Those 'funny' characters make Casablanca more like a menagerie than something with an intelligent plan. Humphrey Bogart - a great actor in The Caine Mutiny, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and even Petrified Forest...but not here. Totally unbelievable and unconvincing as a romantic lead. He doesn't even deliver as an anti-hero in this worn-out, overrated piece of pre-WWII propaganda. Ingrid Bergman - a beautiful lady, and a hundred times better in everything else she did...but a cartoon here. Claude Rains - typical 30's supporting role...goofy, but with a big heart; goes 'straight' in the end. 30's nonsense.The story - lame and predictable. Why did people love Casablanca? Because it stirred their patriotism at a time when Germany was threatening to bulldoze Great Britain and everywhere else. It never was a great, much less an exceptional film.Nowadays, Casablanca coasts along on its shaky reputation, held up as a 'masterpiece', but smelling like the aged soaper that it is.",3,13,34,22 November 2007
As Good as It Gets," Return to Terms of Endearment
","James Brooks is clearly at the center of this mess. First, he dishes out the totally lame Terms of Endearment, then he goes back to the same formula of TV-like performances, to the oohs and ahhhs of the Oscar voters, to give us As Good As it Gets, which could almost be its cousin. What is the attraction for these over the top, unrealistic performances?? Nicholson was leading actor in both, and they both stunk. As Good As it Gets goes on forever, like a bad soap opera that won't end, just like 'Terms' did. All three leading actors have done so much better in other efforts, but I put the blame on 'Mary Tyler Brooks' for making this pastiche as nauseatingly bad as it is. These two movies make a good case for having chimpanzees choose Oscar winners.",2,8,22,11 February 2007
