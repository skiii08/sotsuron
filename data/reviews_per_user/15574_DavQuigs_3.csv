The Rock," Contains one of the best action sequences of all time.
","The scene where the Navy Seals are surrounded by marines in the shower room is one of the best action scenes of all time.  The Seal Team Leader, tells the general that he agrees with what he is fighting for but, like him he swore to protect the USA from enemies foriegn and domestic.  This scene is pulsating with potential action until the pivotal moment when all hell breaks loose.  After the gunfire begins, the dramatic music takes hold and all you can do is watch Seal after Seal, go down.  This scene makes so feel proud that we live in a nation where people will sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent people.  After all the bullets are fired, the whole seal team is dead.  The one moment that will forever make me love this movie is when the general says to the camera I did not want this...damn you for forcing me to make this decision.  It was a great moment in the movie because it shows that even though they had to kill them, Ed Harris still thought of the seals as fellow brothers who went down in combat.  I rated this movie an 8-10 just for the shear greatness of this scene.",8,4,5,25 November 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Sickest Movie Ever
","This has to be one of the sickest movies that I have ever seen in my entire life and I am comparing this to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Dead Alive. This movie is so real that it is disturbing.  The last sequence of shots with the four main characters left me with the feeling that i was going to vomit.   This movie is so terrible, I wouldnt recommend this to anyone, unless they needed to puke for some reason.   1/10  aweful!!!!!!",1,5,12,10 April 2003
Rocky IV," One of the Greatest Movies of all time.
","I cannot even start to understand why this movie has such a low rating. This is one of the greatest movies ever created.  Rocky IV is the climax of all the Rocky movies.  Rocky faces his greatest adversary yet,(Dolph Lundgren) the Russian.  Plus this is the film where Apollo Creed is killed. If you cannot feel the emotion in this movie then you must be one cold hearted person. The battle between the boxers is symbolic of the struggles between Russia and America.  Since America wins, I think everyone should appreciate this film.  Even though in the end Rocky single handedly makes everyone in the stadium like him, whether they are Russian or American. This movie makes the viewer look into their hearts and try to achieve something that seems impossible.  Just the Rocky thought beating the Russian was impossible. For all the people who rated this movie below a 7 - I guess you people couldnt recognize a great film if it bit you in the butt.  My rating for this film is a 10/10, which it should be.",10,1,2,19 November 2002
