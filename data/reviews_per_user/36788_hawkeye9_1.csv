Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lots of action but awful story
","This movie had lots of action, but the story and characters were sorry at best. It was very hard to follow, had no emotion, and was anti-climatic. The villain, Darth Maul, said only two words the whole movie, did nothing but fight with his light saber, and when he gets killed it's like 'who cares'. I felt like this movie was nothing more than a setup for episode 2 and from the looks of the movie theater, on a Friday night the first weekend it was out was only half full, the word has gotten out. Hype can only carry it so far. I felt cheated. Don't waste your money like I did.",1,2,5,29 May 1999
