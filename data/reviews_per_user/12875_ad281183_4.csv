The Incredible Hulk," Much better...
","This is a review of the newly released movie 'The Incredible Hulk.' I do discuss several topics from the movie, although none in detail. I advise anyone who wants to know nothing of this movie at all to skip the rest of this entry.For those who don't mind a light overview and some modest opinions, keep reading. Hope it helps. Cheers!This was far better than 2003's 'Hulk', Ang Lee's previous attempt at the Marvel character. But then again, it would be hard to be worse. Nonetheless, this go round you get a straight forward shot at the makings of the Hulk, followed by scientist Bruce Banner trying to rid himself of his greener alter ego. This movie has action, action, and well, some more action.Betty Ross is more memorably played by Jennifer Connelly, as is 'Thunderbolt' Ross's performance by Sam Elliott. However, Edward Norton is a much better choice as the Incredible Hulk. Eric Bana is a great actor in his own right, but not necessarily right for this part. The story line also follows an edge closer to the TV show that aired during the late 70's and early 80's. And for those true Hulk fans, you will see several notable cameo appearances.Either way, this Hulk definitely out performs its predecessor. And with the integration of characters like Iron Man, Nick Fury, the SHIELD, and soon to be Avengers, comic book fans everywhere will love the intertwining story lines and keep looking to the newly unveiled Marvel Studios (which is now releasing their own films) to thrill fans and stay true to their roots while adding a few new twists and interpretations now and again.To those who have doubt after the 2003 Hulk bomb, give this Marvel superhero one more shot. You won't be disappointed.",8,4,10,13 June 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Eyes
","A mix between 'Wrong Turn' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a nail-biting, grab the person next to you thriller. Of course there is the gore, but it all plays in nicely to give you a worth while moving going experience. One of the better, if not the best, horror movie I have seen in a long while. This movie is based on the notion that during nuclear testing in the North American desert, miners in towns in the area refused to leave their homes and retreated to the mines where they worked. Over time, the nuclear fallout caused severe physical and mental defects in the people exposed to the radiation as well as the off-spring of those inhabitants. These sites were so far of the map that they were forgotten. Set up as a ruthless cat and mouse game, any travelers who accidentally made it to this nuclear wasteland were condemned in a place where 'the lucky ones die first!'",8,0,0,13 March 2006
The Holiday," Great! Left me smiling for hours.
","This movie was full of quirky humor and downright funny scenes. Although the practicality of things working out so well and so fast in this film are unlikely in the real world, we accept it and move on to enjoy the story.It is surprising and uplifting that the story contains more than just Kate-Jack and Cameron-Jude pairs. There is more to the cast and how they interact with each other which brings much more to the plot and the overall enjoyability of the movie.This movie had me laughing constantly, crying occasionally, and feeling great all the way through. I couldn't stop smiling for hours.",10,2,5,11 December 2006
V for Vendetta," Excellent!
","'V for Vendetta' is an utterly remarkable piece of film. It tells the story of a young woman, 'Evey' (Portman), and her journey from being and imprisoned citizen of futuristic England to being a freedom fighter. Her parents were freedom fighters and were killed when she was very young. In a chance encounter one night with some 'finger men' (England's brutal police force), she is rescued by the vigilant 'V', only to watch him in his first terrorist attack on corrupt England. Video surveillance shows her at the scene of the crime, and shortly thereafter she is wanted for arrest. In his second act of terrorism, 'V' shows up at Evey's job, where she subsequently saves him from a policeman, after which she is knocked unconscious. Then and there 'V' makes the decision to take her with him, and so begins her life altering course. She becomes unafraid, unwaivering, and under the spell of the valiant 'V'. The story plays out, and I'll leave the rest for you to see at the movies. 'V for Vendetta' is grasping from beginning to end. It is a rather long movie, but not once in the whole film is there a time when the movie-goer thinks, 'I wish this would just end already.' It literally keeps you locked from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anyone, and would consider going to see it for a second time myself.",10,3,6,20 March 2006
