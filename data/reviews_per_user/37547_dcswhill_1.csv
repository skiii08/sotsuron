Hereditary," Good fun fick
",I enjoyed this for the most part. I heard early on about the unrealistic advertising so I waited until close to the end of the film's run. The best scene for me was the ending scenes. From the time the son wakes up till the king is crowned was awesome. It was very long in parts and the death of the father was the best example of a way too drawn out scene. The only other item keeping me from upping this movie's rating was the mother. I just cringed when the actress started on one of her long rants. I can't pin point if it was the actual actress or the writer but she was terrible.,7,0,2,24 June 2018
