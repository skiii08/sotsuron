Vertigo," It's everything I wish I didn't know
","At the Big W DVD Sale, they had a great 5 movie Hitchcock pack going for $25 cash money. One of the films in it is 'Vertigo'.'Vertigo' is ranked 35 on the IMDb.com top 250, meaning it must have some cred (then again The Simpsons Movie and Casino Royale are in it too, so....). It tells the story of a cop, John Fergurson (James Stewart), who discovers while chasing a bandit that he has vertigo. This causes him to have to quit the force. It's not long before an old friend offers him the chance to do some private detective work, albeit a bit strange as he wants him to track his wife who's doing some weird stuff. Fegurson soon becomes obsessed and forms a relationship with her after saving her from a suicide attempt (or was it???). The relationship grows (I won't go into too much detail as it would really spoil it for anyone planning on seeing it) and comes to a head when Fergurson is forced to face his fears.Some great scenes, with some groundbreaking directing, and an outstanding performance by Stewart. Problem for me was that the story was just a bit weird. The obsessive story was downright creepy at times, especially in the later stages of the movie, but I just thought it could have been more solid. I'm aware it is over 40 years old and obviously was ahead of it's time, but I can't allow for that. I grew up in an era of Hollywood where Robert deNiro put people's head in vices and Joe Pesci stabbed people with pens. Now that's creepy. Having said that, this movie remade in modern times could be potentially awesome (think about 'Fear' done a million times better with first class actors). Worth seeing though for generation X (Y will hate it).Also loses a point for misleading me into thinking the U2 song would be in the soundtrack.",6,0,4,18 August 2007
Walk the Line," Poor man's 'Ray'?
","Wasn't desperate to see this, but wanted to learn a little bit more about the man Johnny Cash.What I learnt was that he hard a tough upbringing, got into drugs, had woman problems and built a massively successful music career. Hardly a new story. I'm not saying his story isn't worth telling, but it's hardly a new music story is it? How many of the music legends of the past 50 years didn't have all the same issues, most notably Ray Charles, who's story was brought to the big screen just the year before? Seems like another case of movie execs saying 'that Ray movie did really well, let's do one like that! Are there any other famous musos who had drug problems?'.Like 'Ray', the highlight of the movie is the rehab stuff, but the rest really wasn't that ground breaking. Phoenix and Witherspoon do good jobs with what they're given, but the story didn't have you on the edge of your seat, plus there wee no great musical moments.Unless the next big music movie is going to be about the Foo Fighters, Billy Ocean or Dexy's Midnight Runners, lets put this genre back in the guitar case for a few years hey!",6,0,2,24 June 2006
Ali," He may have been the greatest, but the movie wasn't
","Finally got around to seeing this after a 4 year wait (hey, it's been a busy millennium).The movie is obviously about Muhammad Ali, following two stages of his boxing career. I'm not sure how and why they picked the stages they did, but for me it was just way too disjointed. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but I feel it would have been a lot better with a stronger structure. The movie basically features his first title fight win, a couple of other fights and the infamous 'Rumble in the Jungle'. It focuses heavily on his relationships, his religion and his fight against the draft. He's no doubt a fascinating character study, but the movie just seemed to miss the boat a bit.The cast is solid with Will Smith as Ali, putting in a decent performance, Jamie Foxx and Jon Voight. Michael Mann's directing is outstanding, highlighted by some excellent fight scenes. Worth seeing, but if you're a big Ali fan you may be a bit disappointed.",7,2,4,29 October 2005
The Longest Yard," It was a'iight
","This was the movie I've most wanted to see on DVD for some time. I love great comedy pairings, and even though in the last decade very few have worked (bar Wilson and Stiller), what else are you gonna see at the movies except a braindead action movie, a comic book adaption or an art-house movie that walk out of totally confused?Anyway, this is a remake of the 70's classic which I never saw. Basically, it's about a washed up,disgraced ex NFL star, who loses the plot one night and crashes a heap of police cars. He goes straight to prison, luckily besides the guards it looks like a lovely place to hang out. Pretty quickly the warden wants to put his football skills to the test and a guards vs crims match is set-up.It's pretty predictable, and focuses pretty much purely on the football game. There's plenty of stars in the movie, but most went into this one purely to CTC. Rock and Sandler put in pretty lazy performances, although they have a few good one-liners. The best performance comes from Terry Crewe, playing Cheeseburger Eddy. He was also great in 'White Chicks', and is likely gonna keep getting these same ridiculous roles for years to come.",7,2,3,11 November 2005
50 First Dates," Really makes you think about what you'd do if you met a girl who couldn't form new memories
","'50 First Dates' is the story about a zoo veterinarian (yeh right) called Henry (Sandler, who plays a lovable goofball for something different). Henry is a major player, renowned for his one-night stands. That's until he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore in her most challenging role since ET). Lucy seems like a new challenge for Henry, even moreso when he discovers she's got brain damage from a car accident that means she can form no new memories from the day before the accident. Rather than quit, Henry decides to give this weird relationship a real go. He soon gains the trust and respect of her family and friends in his quest to get her to get through life in a more normal way.There's plenty of decent laughs, about 70% of which are based around sexual innuendo, but there's some pretty good jokes and scenes in there. Sandler and Barrymore have pretty decent chemistry, which really helps, plus there's some great bit characters given some good stuff to work with. one of the better rom-coms you'll see, if you're a guy that is.",7,0,0,24 February 2008
Deja Vu," More Denzel quality
","Besides the fact I didn't think Tara would be a huge fan, this movie had plenty of ingredients to ensure a great night in. Denzel, Tony Scott, Val Kilmer, time travel.....it could not not be good.The movie begins with a ferry being blown up in a likely terrorist attack. The police are quickly on the scene, with the key figure being Carlin (Washington). Carlin hones in on a woman who was washed up and soon discovers something ain't right. Impressed by his skills, a special operations group, headed by Val Kilmer (man did his career die after 'Heat'), asks him to come in and assist with their work, which includes the use of a state of the art surveillance system which can track anything...as long as it occurred 4 days ago. This technology assists Carlin is backtracking and finding key clues. Obsessed with this technology, Carlin tries to find a way he can interact in the past. I won't give away too much but he finds a way and gets into some Marty McFly-type adventures. The technology is about as plausible as the DeLorean in the 'Back To The Future' franchise, and throws up as many plot concerns, but the movie keeps you enthralled.Great cast, shot excellently, interesting storyline. Well worth watching and way better than I hoped or imagined.",7,2,4,27 July 2007
Meet the Parents," One of the best comedies of the millennium
","When I first heard about this pairing coming together for this movie, I was pretty excited. Even though he's starting to bug me now, Ben Stiler is one of the best comedy actors of the last 15 years. Put him together with in my opinion the best actor ever in DeNiro, and give them a half decent script, and hilarity should follow. DeNiro has done some terrible comedies, most notably the 'Analyse This' series, two movies based around a 'emotionally fragile' mafia boss. C'mon! 'Meet the Parents' focuses on Greg (Stiller) and girlfriend Pam going to see Pam's parents in the hope of softening them up for a marriage proposal. Greg is understandably nervous and when a few things start going wrong, he begins to break. The movie is full of brilliant one liners, sight gags, tragedy gags and lots more. Most of it is based around some dark or unlikely events which nonetheless have you in stitches. There's also a fine cameo by Owen Wilson, playing Pam's ex.The teaming of DeNiro and Stiller works brilliantly and this has to be one of the great comedies of the 2000's.WARNING: Do not see the sequel to this 'Meet The Parents 2' under any circumstances. It is a pure cash in on the first and very little effort went into the script. One of the worst sequels ever. I think I laughed twice.",9,1,2,20 November 2005
Memento," It was pretty cool, i think...damn I forgot
","It's pretty rare a movie goes from being OK to brilliant in a few short minutes. 'Memento' joins the short list I know of, most notably 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Primal Fear'.'Memento' tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce, in his best role since playing Mike in 'Neighbours'...ok he was pretty good in 'LA Confidential' and 'The Count of Monte Cristo'),a man who suffers from short term memory loss. Leonard was involved in a near fatal murder attempt on he and his wife and now is on a mission to find his would be assassin. Problem is having no short term memory makes things pretty difficult. Leonard overcomes this by tattooing his body with key pieces of information and keeping photographs of key people and places.The movie plays backwards, so we see the ending and then learn the story backwards. Because we don't get this that often it makes it really tricky to follow, and at times so confusing you want to turn off. A movie buff friend of mine says 'I like movies where you don't have to think too much', and in this movie you can't afford to vague out for 5 minutes. When the movie ended I watched the last few scenes back a few times to fully piece it all together. Excellent film, held together by an outstanding performance by Guy Pearce.",8,0,2,11 May 2006
The Fan," A great idea that didn't quite work
","Sports and Robert DeNiro together. I was in heaven...until I saw the movie It seemed like a great idea, but it just didn't quite work. A bit of a combination of an ordinary, if not over-necessarily creepy storyline, and an ordinary script. The movie revolves around Robert DeNiro's character, Gil, an over obsessed sports fan who decides he wants to play an active role in the career of Bobby (Wesley Snipes), in a performance that will be mentioned in the same sentence as 'Passenger 57'. Gil cracks when problems with his family and job explode, causing him to focus all his energies in Bobby. How far will Gil go to get what he wants? See it to find out.Pretty disappointed with this movie, although it features one of my favourite scenes ever when Gil and Bobby have a little game of baseball near the end.",6,3,5,19 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Brilliant
","Haven't read the book of this but saw an animated version many years ago. I was blown away by this adaption.The story follows a family of 4 children, sent away by their mother to live with a professor away from the war zone that threatened their lives. The house is pretty sterile, the professor stand-offish and it seems the kids will be bored out of their brains. While in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest child (and star of the movie), stumbles across a wardrobe that leads somehow into the magical land of Narnia. When Lucy returns and retells her adventure, everyone thinks she is crazy, but eventually they discover Narnia exists. As they check out Narnia, they become caught up in a battle. You'll need to see it to find out more.The movie is an adaption of the CS Lewis classic. The movie version, due to Disney's brilliance, brings great power and passion to Lewis's story and I'm pretty sure he'd be happy with the portrayal. Many may not know that the message behind the story is the message of Jesus, portrayed through Aslan. It shows us the purpose of Jesus' life- to die as a sacrifice for others. The story also features many themes close to Lewis' heart- forgiveness, redemption, the search for truth.Excellent movie for the kids- there are a few scary scenes with some animals and some battles, but most kids 7+ should be fine. Excellent effects too.",8,5,7,28 December 2005
Happy Gilmore," Sandler's Finest Hour
","One of my favourite comedies Happy Gilmore (Sandler) is a wannabe hockey player, who'll clearly never make it. One day he's chatting to some movers and places a bet over who can hit a golf ball the farthest. Happy smacks the hell out of it, and soon realizes this newfound skill may be able to help him out, most of all with his grandmother faced with losing her house. Before the wins start rolling in though, Happy must get his putting and wild temper under control.Will happy get his game together in time to save grandma? take a wild guess.An excellent movie full of laughs and memorable moments. Sandler is in excellent form, but many laughs come from the support cast as well, especially Ben Stiller and Carl Wethers. Well worth seeing.",9,0,2,11 November 2006
Hot Fuzz," Hot
","With little available on the 'New Releases' front at Video Busters, wifey and I went the weekly route. One of the choices was 'Hot Fuzz'.'Hot Fuzz' stars Simon Pegg (in his best work since 'MI3') as an over the top cop whose extreme dedication to the job has seen him wear out his welcome in London. His superiors decide to send him to a quiet little town that should settle him down and allow him to take it easy. Upon his arrival, he discovers it's even sleepier than he imagined. He takes to arresting underage drinkers and minor offenders to pass the time until he's advised the local cops like to take a more carefree approach. Soon though some out-of-nowhere murders start taking place and Angel (Pegg) has a mystery to solve that he's been waiting for. The action gets intense and Angel is in for the biggest battle of his life.Quite different but really enjoyable. The film does get a bit weird, but you kind of see it coming, although it does get pretty zany near the end. Some interesting directing, quirky jokes and full-on-yet-humorous violent scenes make it unlike anything I'd seen before. Pegg is great as Angel and there's a strong supporting cast, most notably Nick Frost as Danny.Well worth a watch.",8,2,4,27 April 2009
Troy," Crowd pleaser
","TROY Pulled this out from the old collection last night. Had never got round to watching it because, to be honest, I wasn't expecting much. Fair to say I was prove right.Another movie based upon the Helen of Troy, Achilles and Trojan Horse stories. For a big budget movie, they cast pretty low budget, with just Brad Pitt (Achilles) and Eric Bana (Hector) in main roles, as well as Rose Byrne and Orlando Bloom in minor roles. The story is pretty well known, so not too many surprises, it was just going to be how the movie looked and played out. The movie holds your interest, although there are a few cringe moments, with some terribly poor or clichéd lines. The actors aren't given much to work with (obviously not much of the budget went towards the screenplay). There's some good action sequences though and a few decent scenes, overall a good movie to watch on a boring night at home.",7,0,3,15 October 2005
Insomnia," He's so tired he can't sleep
","'Insomnia' is a story about a cop (Will Dormer-played by Al Pacino) sent to Alaska to help a friend solve the grizzly murder of a local teenage girl. Dormer amazes the locals, most notably young cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and Fred (Nicky Katt) with his unorthodox methods. Dormer organises a set-up and what should be a routine capture of the main suspect goes horribly wrong when Dormer shoots his partner (Martin Donovan). Dormer covers up the unseen accidental shooting, but things get complicated when the prime suspect (Walter Finch- played by Robin Williams in his creepiest role since 'Mrs Doubtfire') sees what happened. Finch tries to broker a deal to get himself in the clear, and a game of trickery unfolds.Not a heart racer, but certainly suspenseful and worth a watch. Good cast, good story, good setting.Oh yeh, it's called 'Imsomnia' because he can't sleep at night. Is it because of the 24hr daylight or him wrestling conscience?.......You'll have to see it to find out.",7,0,0,28 March 2008
Juno," Annoying
","So on Friday, against my preference, wifey got out 'Juno' from Blockbuster. I was so not keen on seeing it for several reasons, yet was surprised- it annoyed me even more than I expected.Juno (played by Ellen Page) is perhaps one of the most annoying leads from a teen movie in recent memory. She's a cocky, alternative teenager who decides one day she wants to express her feelings physically with her longtime friend Bleeker (played well by Michael Cera). As luck would have she gets pregnant and is faced with a big decision. She decides at first to go the abortion route but when she gets annoyed in the waiting room she decides to just give it up for adoption. She quickly finds a suitable couple called Mark and Vanessa (played well by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) in a local paper and her mind is at ease. She's a little cautious at first but eventually becomes very comfortable with them as Mark turns out to be really cool and Jennifer seems really genuine and excited. Just when things seem too perfect Mark and Vanessa split and Juno has another big decision to make. Luckily though everything turns out cool and Juno can shoot the bay out and get back to her real life and emerging cool band.Objectionable and troubling on so many levels. If you're a parent and your teen daughter gets pregnant I wouldn't recommend getting out the popcorn and popping this on. Deals with some extremely serious topics in a very irresponsible and appalling manner.At the end of the movie wifey thought I was over the top with my analysis, yet has issues with some of the violent stuff I watch so I guess the moral is 'Different movies, different things to be offended by'",3,8,18,29 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," Better than 2, not as good as 1.
","With wifey away, decided to go and catch a flick. Wasn't heaps out, so settled on Spiderman 3, a movie I figured would be best viewed at the movies.Spiderman 3 picks up with MJ(Dunst) and Peter/Spiderman(Maguire) in love and all things are going great. Things get much better when early on Harry faces of with Spiderman and comes off second best, badly hitting his head which causes memory loss and for him to forget that Pete is Spiderman. Just when it seems life is perfect things take a nosedive. MJ's career is dealt a massive blow when she's dropped from her just released theatre show, a new photographer comes onto the scene at the Globe and a new enemy rises, Sandman. Soon Pete is going through a series of crisis's and things go worse when he is somehow dealt a black spidey suit, which takes over and makes him feel indestructible and overconfident.I won't go into much more detail, but Spiderman faces his biggest challenges ever in all facets of his life.The movie is OK, but things happen a little too conveniently, even for a superhero movie. The action is just too overdone and actually gets dizzying at times. Tends to drag at times as well. A great performance by Maguire, who carries the movie, with little support from Dunst who just has to portray two emotions- despair and sadness.",6,0,1,10 June 2007
The Prestige," It's Good
","In my motel room the other night I caught this on the movie channel. Here's my thoughts.'The Prestige' is kind of like 'The Illusionist', only a bit different. It is built upon the story of two rising magicians- Alfred (Bale) and Robert (Jackman) who soon become bitter rivals after Alfred seemingly kills his girlfriend on purpose (that would do it for me). They become engrossed in a a game of 'can you top this' with no rules, causing a lot of tragedy and pain along the way. Near the end of the movie it seems Robert, who has generally been the follower and not the leader, finally pulls of a stunt that blows Alfred's mind. Has Robert finally outdone his foe? See it to find out.A gripping story, with plenty of action and a lot for the audience to try to work out. The main stars are excellent, brilliantly supported by Michael Caine, and not so much by Scarlett Johansson. One of the better movies of the millennium.",7,1,2,22 December 2008
Crash," Excellent
","Very different to what I expected, pleasantly surprised. Probably more a movie a college sociological student should be reviewing, not me.'Crash' intertwines a bunch of stories revolving around people involved, directly or indirectly, in several car crashes over 24hrs in LA. Those involved include cops, gangsters, a TV producer, a politician, an illegal immigrant smuggler and more. We get an insight into their lives and situations and are left with a bunch of questions. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? What is racism? Is prejudice ever acceptable? Like most modern movies, the decision is left to you- the idea of the movie is to get you thinking.The movie is shot extremely well, written brilliantly and outworked by an excellent cast including Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser (in his best role since 'Encino Man') and a bunch of newcomers who were outstanding. It was also refreshing in it's lack of falling for predictable scenarios, often even setting you up for it but surprising you. Well worth seeing.",8,2,6,10 May 2006
Knocked Up," Some gold
","This week we started another 'Quickflix' trial, and Tara loaded up our want list. The first DVD to arrive was 'Knocked Up'. Here's my IMDb.com review.'Knocked Up' starts Seth Rogen (in his best work since a guest appearance in 'Dawson's Creek') and Katherine Heigl (in her finest role since she played Sarah in 'Under Siege 2) as Ben and Alsion, two people who hook up in a night club and have a one night stand. Ben is a loser stoner, Sarah an up and coming entertainment reporter. The next morning Sarah realises what a loser Ben is and quickly tries to end it quickly....until she discovers she's pregnant. Sarah then decides to track Ben down and get him to be a part of this unexpected surprise. She soon learns although he's a complete loser who spends his time hitting the pipe and watching movies with ladies with no clothes on, he's sweet too. Sarah has to work out though if she wants to shack up with him and become a family or to have the child and try to continue on her career path and hopefully meet someone fancier.It's pretty rude and crude, with lots of sweet 'ohhhhhh' moments to balance it out.... sorta. Some potential jokes were left hanging, while others where done to death. Ben's housemates provided plenty of laughs and really stole most of the great scenes. Jason Segel as Jason was probably my favourite character in the movie. Pretty funny overall, but plenty of awkward, uncomfortable moments.",7,0,1,2 April 2009
Blades of Glory," Bit weird
","'Blades of Glory' is about 2 ice skaters, Chas Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder), two former ex-rivals who decide to team up as a duo when they are banned from individual events. Their ban came from a punch up that occurred on a podium after a heated competition several years back. MacElroy gets the idea from a stalker (one of the better characters in the movie who was way underused). He approaches Michaels who baulks at first but soon realises it's a chance for him to hit the big time again.Not Ferrell's best work, but some OK jokes. The humour is much more warped and abstract than his normal stuff and is consequently very hit and miss. Heder doesn't bring much to his role, maybe an Owen Wilson or such could have brought more to the role.",6,1,1,3 November 2007
Nacho Libre," Pleasant
","Wasn't expecting heaps out of this movie- and i wasn't let down.The movie is about a Priest (Black), who decides to enter a local wrestling competition purely so he can win prize money and provide a better living for the kids in his orphanage. The Priest must hide his identity though as the church is against this form of sport. The priest goes on a journey of emotions until he decides to quit. Not long after this decision though the Priest gets offered a shot at the Champ. Will he take it on? Can he win? Pleasant, with a few small laughs, but nothing amazing. Good family film I guess, with no colorful language or offensive material.",6,0,2,3 February 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Better than the second , not as good as the original
","Refused to go see this at the cinema due to the bad taste still in my mouth from 'Oceans Twelve'.The premise of 13 is pretty simple. Reuben (Gould), the gang's buddy casino owner has just been shafted in a deal with hotshot casino owner Banks (Pacino). The gang wants revenge, and so sets out to make every gambler a winner on the new casino's opening night by rigging all the machines. Forget how totally implausible this is and just enjoy the banter and charisma of the showcase of Hollywood stars in the movie, most notably Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Most of the characters seem to have no more than 100 words of dialogue and 15 minutes of screen time. It's OK, but the idea has kinda been done to death. A few good laughs, but not worth adding to your collection.",7,0,1,26 October 2007
We Are Marshall," We Are Satisfied
","'We Are Marshall' is a true story about the tragic plane crash containing almost the entire school's football team back in 1970 and the aftermath that followed (as aftermaths do).In 1970, the Marshall Football Team chartered a plane back home after a game and the plane crashed into trees not far from their destination. The small community is rocked and everyone is impacted in a great way. After the initial grieving, the school must decide if it will field a team the next year. At first the feeling is to bypass the new season as nearly all the squad has gone, but a few of the remaining players push to do all they can to field a team. They hire coach Jack Lengyel (McConaughey, in a strong, charming performance) to assemble a team and soon find many supporters who will help them get on their feet, notably the NCAA who change a rule for them and their rival school, who assists with some resources. The story focuses on Jack, returning coach Red (Matthew Fox from that stupid 'Lost' show) and a few of the players who missed the trip due to injury or suspension. It soon becomes clear though they face a huge challenge to be competitive and not embarrass the school. Will they prove to be a Cinderella story or will they suck? A solid movie and a little different to what you may expect from the genre. Fox, McConaughey and David Strathairn are all solid but we don't get to know too much about the players, and the actors who play them seem a little out of their comfort zone. A great story and worth seeing.",7,3,3,5 January 2009
The Devil Wears Prada," And the message is.........
","No prizes for guessing this was a wifey pick. Not much about it appealed to me at all, but I gave it a go. 'The Devil Wears Prada' tells the story of Andy Sachs (Hathaway), a young aspiring journalist who gets a big break by landing a PA role for the queen of the fashion world, Miranda Prisetly (Streep). Andy isn't a fashion follower at all and only sees the job as a stepping stone into big time journalism. She soon learns though that if she wants to get anywhere, she better get into the fashion thing. Before she knows it her personal life is getting infringed by the demanding hours and chores that come along with the job.Will she stick it out? Will she sell out? OK, but a totally confusing message which seemed to change several times through the movie. Some good performances, but certainly way too over rated.",6,2,4,25 March 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Lots of cool stunts
","'The Bourne Ultimatum' is the third installment in the highly popular 'Bourne' series. In this installment we find Bourne (Matt Damon, in a much less tearful performance than 'Good Will Hunting', which also starred Ben Affleck who flushed his career down the toilet) again on the hunt to track down his identity, his past and the people who hired him. Once again to do this he must get in car chases, jump buildings, have cool martial arts fights, improvise in impossible situations and play tricks to do so. They story isn't heaps complex, the dialogue is minimal but the action,stunts and camera work are first class. Damon carries the bulk of the movie on his back, with minor support roles from Joan Allen and 'not so man voice anymore' Julia Stiles. Well worth a watch.",8,0,0,2 January 2008
Notting Hill," Top shelf romantic comedy
","As far as romantic comedies, this is in the upper echelon.The movie revolves around William (the delightful Hugh Grant...again), a struggling book store owner who's world is turned upside down when he meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a huge American movie star. Their paths cross several times and after the media discovers the blossoming relationship, Williams life, and Anna's also, will never be the same. Can these two seemingly complete opposites make it work, or are they too different? A brilliantly done movie, backed by an excellent supporting cast, most notably Rhys Ifans as William's roommate Spike. Plenty of memorable scenes, especially when William poses as a reporter and one of the great music moments in a movie when William walks the streets to 'Ain't no sunshine'.Guys, if you have to endure one romantic comedy, you could go a lot worse than this eg 'Monster in Law' or anything with Meg Ryan.",8,4,4,28 January 2006
Burn After Reading," Poor
","Friday night made the big mistake of hiring 'Burn After Reading'. For some reason I thought it would be more enjoyable than the other awful Coen brothers movies i'd seen (The Ladykillers, O Brother Where Art Though etc) with it's great cast and wacky storyline. Bad move. As always, the old 'stick with what you know' motto I've lived my life by would have served me well if I stayed disciplined.The film is about some dimwitted fitness instructors (played by McDormand and Pitt) who stumble across a seemingly top secret disc with government files. Linda (McDormand) sees a great opportunity for blackmail and therefore the chance to fund her required plastic surgery while Chad (Pitt) just sees the chance to score some free money. Soon they become embroiled in a serious situation and it's no longer a chance for easy money. Will they pull it off? See it to find out.**Spoiler alert**. The story was going OK but had several irrelevant story lines that weakly ended up intertwining with the main story (Malkovich, Clooney etc). The ending was a massive letdown to say the least. Besides Brad Pitt's performance there wasn't much to salvage. I know some people will say 'you just don't get the genius of the Coen brothers', but personally i think they are knobheads.",5,1,3,28 February 2009
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon is tops
","Rewatched on TV last week and din't realise I hadn't reviewed before, so here it is Have you ever woken up on a strange boat with bullet holes in you and not knowing where you are or who you are? Then you'll love 'The Bourne Identity'.'The Bourne Identity' is built around Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), who wakes up on a table on a boat in the middle of the ocean. He has no idea where he is, who he is and how he got on the boat. Upon arriving on land he begins to try to discover who he is. It soon becomes clear he's some sort of assassin. he sets out to discover who he works for and what lies ahead. With the help of a strange girl, he digs up his past and finds out pieces of the puzzle that is him.Really good movie. Shot in some great locations, with some excellent fight sequences. The greatest appeal of the movie though is the lack of dialogue, Bourne is cold and calculated and overdone verbal communication would be out of place. Top stuff.",7,0,1,17 August 2007
Footloose," It makes me feel like dancing
","EVERYBODY CUT FOOTLOOSE As we all know 1984 produced a lot of great things. One of the best was 'Footloose'. Here's my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece which I brought on DVD this week-Most good movies have a great opening and Footloose is no exception. A bunch of feet dancing showcasing the great footwear of the 80's to the soundtrack song 'Footloose'. Immediately gets you in -Kevin Bacon's character has one of the all-time great movie names: 'Ren McCormack' -Funny how this is probably Kevin Bacon's greatest role, maybe only challenged by 'Flatliners'. It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie (See Lou Diamond Phillips, Chris Rock and Madonna for starters) -Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers, Sean Penn's brother Christopher. He's way better than Dan Swayze or Charlie Murphy. -Kenny Loggins will go down as one of the greatest contributors to movie hit songs ever. Footloose's 'Footloose' and Top Gun's 'Danger Zone'. -This is another one of those movies built around a town's overzealous pastor's. Reverand Shaw (John Lithgow) is even more intense than that guy in 'Chocolat' -Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing (watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car) -Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo -Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghetto-blaster. Everyone stops talking, eating and dancing. Possibly slightly dramatic -Will (Christopher Penn) tells us several other towns have also banned dancing. How wasn't that fact used as the premise for heaps more sequels with Ren going from town to town and reviving dance? Each time he'd face a new obstacle. -Ren mentions his love for 'Men at Work' and 'The Police', yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock. Strange. -Weird town. Here a face off equals a tractor fight. -One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts 'I need a hero' on on his ghetto-blaster. That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in. -Another great Dianne Weist performance. That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants. Underrated actress. -'Moment I regret now'- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to 'Let's Hear It For The Boy' (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history. That is until Sly Stallone raised the bar with his 'If I Can Change....' in Rocky 4. Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's 'Can you see her...' speech in 'A Time To Kill'",8,24,43,15 October 2005
Armageddon," I did want to close my eyes, I did want to fall asleep
","Stumbled across 'Armageddon' the other night on Foxtel, and with little to do and my brain reasonably empty, decided to rewatch it. When I first saw this at the cinema back in 1998, I remember thinking it was one of the dumbest films ever plus I was completely fed up with the 'natural disaster' genre that was drowning society. Would time change my perception? 'Armageddon' deals with the question 'what would happen if a meteor bigger than earth hit earth?'. For some reason the US discovered this threat and decided they alone could come up with the answer. Their solution was to send a bunch of misfits who drill for oil into a spaceship to land on the meteor, drill a huge hole in it, then send a nuclear bomb inside it and blow it up from the inside. Genius.NASA enlists the 'world's best driller', luckily also American Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to come and help select the best drill and a plan to get the bomb into the meteor. Harry thinks it will be easier to use his crew who he's used to working with, rather than professional astronauts and scientists. Reluctantly NASA agrees and starts training the crew for the most important job ever in the world. During and after the tests it's clear the team isn't up to it, but they go anyways. Will this cast of misfits save the world? Take a wild guess.Worth watching for the pure comedy factor, if you can overcome the normal US arrogance and ridiculous storyline. A solid cast, given little to work with, covers a multitude of flaws, most noticeably the crappy Aerosmith theme song. Gets bonus points for Pete Stormare who plays the Russian astronaut.",6,2,3,11 May 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," And the point is................
","Wifey got this as a birthday gift and was really keen for me to see it.'Little Miss Sunshine' follows a family entering their daughter into a kids beauty pageant. Olive (the girl) has been working on her routine for ages and is overcome with excitement when she's invited to enter the Little Miss Sunshine event at the last minute. The family, consisting of mum and dad, grandpa, brother and uncle get into the family VW and trek hundreds of miles to get to the event. It's here where we learn a lot about the characters and their life situation. The dad (Kinnear) is hoping his book deal will come through during the trip. The brother doesn't wanna be there and isn't much value as he's taken a vow of silence until he becomes a pilot. The uncle has just returned from a suicide attempt and is looking for his next move. Grandpa is into drugs and women.It's a nice story, dealing with the issues of a dysfunctional family, thrown into the dysfunctional world of beauty pageants. Some food for thought, but hard to say what the over riding message was. I guess it's for us to figure out. Pretty good though,with some funny moments. A strong cast,especially Steve Carrell as the uncle.",7,0,0,14 April 2007
"I, Robot"," I-Liked
","'I-Robot' is the story about a man (Will Smith) who hates robots and doesn't trust them. His issues date back an incident that occurred a while ago when he and a young girl were drowning and the robot saved the girl and not him. You see, robots are designed, supposedly to never harm humans and to sacrifice themselves for humans. The age old problem with robots though is they don't have a heart, and will was annoyed it didn't know to save the girl instead of him.It's now 2035 and Del Spooner (Smith) is called in to investigate the death of the 'father of robots', Dr Lanning. He soon discovers this apparent suicide looks dicey and through a hologram Spooner realizes he is being asked to investigate what's going on with robots. When he comes across a disobedient robot, he soon discovers something big is happening. Will Spooner save the human race from killer robots? See it to find out.Despite the silly premise, it's actually a decent film. Will Smith holds it together well, as does the robot played Sonny. There are clear story lines with the creation/gospel message too and the movie is a great analogy for the gospel story. Well worth seeing.",7,0,0,8 November 2008
American Beauty," If you love plastic bags flying about, you'll love this
","Rewatched this today after it was replayed on the telly. Wasn't a massive fan of the movie when it came out, but back in '99 I preferred zany comedies and movies with machine guns.The movie follows a family out of control. The dad (Spacey, in a great performance) has had enough of being pushed around by his wife and his work. His wife (Bening) is sick of her unfulfilled life. The daughter is sick of her family. The daughter has a friend (Suvari) who has men issues and also a neighbour who is creeping her out. The movie gets in motion as the dad starts turning into a different person. He quits his job, stands up to his wife, starts smoking pot and starts working out. His actions have a chain reaction on his family and their lives all change dramatically.The movie has several interesting themes, and leaves a few things for the viewer to ponder. A refreshingly different, deep movie, if not at times a bit too arty for the sake of art (eg the plastic bag scene). Well worth a watch, but be prepared for a few uncomfortable moments. Some very funny moments courtesy of Spacey.",8,0,2,15 September 2006
Rocky IV," 'If I Can Change...'
","Certainly the best of the Rocky franchise and one of the best movies ever, particularly in the Comedy/Action genre (not that it's supposed to be a comedy).This movie picks up with Apollo in retirement, with Rocky the World Champ. When Russian sensation Drago hits the boxing world, it's clear the sport has changed as we know it. Apollo is grated by the Russian's brash attitude and begs Rocky to let him take him on in an exhibition. Rocky agrees and Apollo takes on Drago in the exhibition. Tragedy follows, and without giving too much away it's safe to say Apollo won't be making any more comebacks.Rocky is crushed and is faced with an agonizing decision- does he take this like a little girl or does he seek revenge? Sure the Russian is twice his size, but Rocky has heart. This is where the movie takes off with some electrifying boxing sequences, music courtesy of 'Survivor' and brilliant scripting, culminating in the best speech in the history of cinema. If you haven't seen it, rush to the video store now. You'll need to see this if you're planning on checking out Rocky XI, something I won't be doing as I've never seen Rocky V because I want the Rocky Franchise to end on a high for me, something I wished I'd done after Police Academy 4.",8,1,2,21 October 2005
Dreamgirls," Better than other musicals eg Cats
","Wifey was really keen to see this, so I psyched myself up and prepared for a few hours of musical madness. There was some hope though as it had Eddie Murphy and Beyonce in it.'Dreamgirls' tells the story of a fictional soul group from the 60's and follows their journey into the music industry. The movie is based upon the hit Broadway musical from the 80's. The story got moving quickly, which was a good thing, and most of the main characters had been introduced 10mins in. Before too long though I found myself wondering how Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson were going to put in award- nominating performances (both won Golden Globes, and Hudson an Acadmey Award). They were good and all, but not award winning stuff, especially with Eddie Murphy, who played almost the same character as in I-Spy, except for the smack addiction.The story is decent and thankfully doesn't go the route I thought it would, which is a great thing considering the current movie industry. Good movie, solid cast, especially Jamie Foxx. Not too bad at all.",7,0,0,24 June 2007
Spider-Man," Way better than Batman
","'Spiderman' was one of my favourite cartoons as a kid. Spidey was just the perfect combination- he could climb walls,he was strong,could fly with his webs and shoot webs from his hands. I used to think how cool that would be. So you knew when this got adapted to a movie with humans in it, I'd be one of the first ones in line (if a stack of nerds didn't beat me to it) The movie starts with Peter Parker (Maguire) on a school trip checking out an animal lab. Pretty soon he gets bitten by a mutant spider, causing a nasty bite and pretty soon some big side effects eg super strength and being able to shoot webs from his wrists. While this weird stuff is going on, Peter is still trying to woo Mary-Jane (Dunst), his cute next door neighbour. Peter soon becomes fascinated with his newfound skills and decides to enter a fighting comp. He wins, but decides he should dedicate his skills to helping people, not living large. When the Green Goblin (DaFoe) comes onto the scene, it's clear we have a good old good vs evil battle brewing.There's lots of twists, love triangles, relationship struggles and more that make this more than just a boring old comic adaption. Way better than the original Batman and it's predecessors. Worth seeing.",7,1,2,27 January 2006
Jarhead," My first Jake Gylenhall movie since 'The Day After Tomorrow'
","Wasn't super keen on seeing this, but wifey thought it was worth a look.The movie is an adaption of a novel written by Anthony Swofford,a soldier who served in Desert Storm. We follow Anthony's entry into the Marines and then his deployment to Iraq to be involved in Desert Storm, a mission to basically guard the Oilfields and watch for attackers.The movie shows us a bit of what life in the Marines is like, plus shows the great depth of emotions soldiers go through, from monotony to sheer horror. I was not overly impressed by the actual story, which seemed to be a bit shallow and, bar a few scenes, didn't go into great detail about the emotions and feelings of the characters. Maybe this was purely because of how the writer put his feelings to paper, but the director should have been able to portray this for him. There were a few powerful scenes, but I feel the actors, particularly Pete Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx, were wasted. Maybe I was just confused, but I felt there was stuff there Swofford felt, but couldn't portray except done through visual, over the top scenes. Some may argue his feelings were sincere and honest and were portrayed in that manner and the director chose not to go down the usual Hollywood route of lots of unrealistic crying/great speech moments, but I'd argue then the movie should have been done in a totally different manner than as a 'Blockbuster'.",7,0,1,9 September 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Extremely re-watchable
","One of the better action/comedies going around.The movie revolves around a couple of thieves (Clooney and Pitt) who conceive a brilliant idea of how to rob a casino of millions. Danny Ocean (Clooney) needs another 9 men though to pull this off (get it, Oceans 11) and goes about finding a group of specially skilled cons to help pull off his elaborate plan (great cast including Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac and Matt Damon).For the genre the action is fantastic, and there's no guns. The chemistry, thanks largely to the writing, between Danny and Tess (Julia Roberts), is excellent. To top it off there's some great jokes and one-liners too.Great plot, great cast and great writing make this one of the best of it's genre and one of the most re-watchable movies ever.",8,0,0,30 April 2006
Tropic Thunder," There was no 'thunderous applause' from me, that's for damn sure
","This was one that I kinda wanted to see at the movies, but was more than happy to wait for it on DVD. Good move.'Tropic Thunder' is a movie about a bunch of primadonna actors (in the movie, not in real life....I think) played by Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jnr who are on the set what is supposed to be the biggest war movie ever. Within days the movie is a month behind schedule and the trio's antics are bugging everyone, from the director through to the executive producer (played by Tom Cruise, in a disguise so good Tara didn't even pick him). To teach them a lesson, they are placed in the middle of the jungle to fend for themselves, under the threat of the Vietcong and animal attacks (one of the best scenes of the movie). They still think they're filming until things become a little odd. Will the guys work out what's going on and get outta dodge? See it to find out.Not bad, but not enough jokes and plenty of poor ones. Ben Stiller and Rob Downey get most of the laughs, with little left for Jack Black. Tom Cruise was just a tad over the top for me, but got nominated for awards, so go figure.",6,0,3,20 January 2009
Quantum of Solace," Way better Bond
","Sat night Dean and I headed to Forest Hill to go see the latest Bond flick- 'Quantum of Solace'. It would be the first Bond flick I'd seen since 'The World Is Not Enough' , the one with Denise Richards as Christmas the nuclear scientist, which should tell you how credible that was. That put me off seeing Bond flicks for a while, but seeing as i'd been invited plus we now had D Craig as the the main man, I thought I had nothing to lose.'Quantum of Solace' is about Bond being on a mission to hunt down a guy who killed a good friend of his (I think). In the middle of that he gets caught up in a plot to overthrow the Bolivian government (man they must have used up a lot of countries) and a rort revolving around natural resources. Luckily most of the film though focuses on vehicle chases and explosions. Some of it pretty jerky, making it hard to properly follow and also allowing them to get away with some of the most ridiculous stunts ever. The film climaxes with Bond and his ally Camille both given the chance to exact revenge.Good action stunts, and I much prefer this moody, troubled Bond than the suave one. Add the great locations and you have an enjoyable movie. Worth seeing.",7,1,5,13 December 2008
Batman Begins," Way better than expected- blows 'Spiderman' away
","Went along expecting this to be similar to Spiderman, but obviously just darker. When we found a young Bruce Wayne up in the Himalyan Mountains studying traditional Martial Arts, it was clear this was going to be different.Batman Begins takes us back, as the tile would suggest, to the early days of Batman. It shows us his childhood, beginning with how his parents died, and his teenage years that led him to become Batman. This part of the story is excellent, and we don't actually see Bruce get into costume for 30-40 minutes. He dons the costume when a threat hits the city in the form of a gas that makes people go coco bananas. He surrounds himself with some good people and some sweet gadgets and weapons.A great, slightly creepy story supported by an excellent cast including Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy. Much respect to Bale though, who was outstanding and makes you wonder why his name isn't mentioned alongside the greats more. Probably because he's not a sell-out. I'm sure he wouldn't have done this movie if his sidekick was Christopher O'Donnell and Mr Freeze was in it.",8,0,0,30 December 2005
Meet the Fockers," I've never felt so dirty
","Remember at school when you used to get beaten up, get your head flushed down the toilet, get pushed into doggie doo, have the bully wipe boogies on you and then spit on you? If you do, I'm really sorry for you. I can't imagine what that was like...actually I can, because I spent $14 to see 'Meet The Fockers'.I LOVED meet 'Meet The Parents'. Loved it. Own it. When you put 3 of my favourite actors into a comedy, I'm bound to be pleased...unless it's in a shameless sequel. 'Meet The Fockers' takes us to meet Greg's parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barabar Streisand. Don't get me wrong they're great actors, I loved 'Rainman' and ....actually can't think of any Streisand movie I've seen but I hear she was massive in the 70's. Their characters are terrible though- two sex crazed lunatic extroverts. Greg obviously knows they won't get on great with Pam's folks..and he's proved right. While they are there, there are of course lots of unbelievable accidents and events, each more over the top than the last (and less funny than anything in the first, except maybe when Greg babysits).I didn't laugh during the movie at all. Maybe smiled twice. Maybe it was funnier than I thought but I just felt so ripped off and dirty I was slightly tainted. It was clear the producers thought 'Man I can't believe how much people liked Meet The Parents. Let's do it again, add a couple of characters played by big stars to rope in some more people and sack all the writers except the guy who wrote that bit where Greg smokes on the roof and sets the house on fire. He gets promoted and gets to write the whole thing.'",1,1,2,14 January 2006
The Transporter," Jackie Chan wannabe movie
","I hired this movie because our video shop has a deal- hire 1 overnight Mon-Thurs and get a free weekly. As they only have about 300 weeklies, my options are getting limited. Soon I'll be hiring Never Ending Story 3.I picked this one because (a) I saw they've made a sequel, which means either the first one was good, or lots of people went to see it (b) it has Jason Statham in it, who hasn't let me down before.The movie follows the Transporter (Statham), which is a much better name than 'The Courier' or 'The Parcel Guy'. The Transporter's mission statement basically reads do the job, do it smart, don't break your rules (think DeNiro's character in 'The Score'. When one inadvertently gets involved in one of his jobs, his simple business is turned upside down. He's not going to get uninvolved without lots of flying kicks, explosions, oil and a cool cop.Kept me entertained, but a pretty shallow script, weak supporting cast and some ridiculous action sequences that would make Jackie Chan wince. Still, you could do worse, which I'm sure will be evidenced by my next review on a weekly hired from my video store.",6,0,0,30 December 2005
Revolutionary Road," A little revolutionary
","'Revolutionary Road' reunites 'Titanic' stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a story about a couple who become unhappy with where their life is and decide to set off for Paris. Leo plays Frank, a business man who is becoming increasingly bored with his life and has realised he's not where he wants to be. Winslet plays April, a stay-at-home mum who still yearns to become a great actress (her character, not Kate Winslet) but realises that part of her life has probably passed her by. One night April confronts Frank that they should up and move to Paris, a place Frank loves and that may enable him to chase his true dreams. At first Frank comes up with all the negatives, but soon realises 'why not!'. They start making plans but things get railroaded when April gets pregnant and Frank gets offered a way better job with a lot more money. Will they still chase their dreams, or will their responsibilities keep them home? Something different, as the movie leaves it to you for the most part to decide whether life is about chasing our dreams, fulfilling our responsibilities...or a bit of both. Well acted and a good story, but it got a bit too silly for my liking in the last 30mins. Worth a look.",7,0,0,7 June 2009
Gran Torino," Go ahead, make his tea
","Headed to Eastland last night with Dean and Cam to see 'Gran Torino'.It's about, get this, 78 year old ex-Korean War veteran Walt (played by Clint Eastwood, who is the only person who could possibly have played this, but still had some ridiculous moments) who comes to the aid of his neighbours and takes on several gangs.The film starts with a Hmong boy named Thao being initiated by his cousin's gang (against his will) by stealing Walt's prized 'Gran Torino'. Thao fails and is sent by his family to do chores for Walt. In the midst of this the gang returns to shake Thao up and Walt confronts them with a rifle. Walt continues his frenzy by taking on a few other hooligans. Soon Walt, initially extremely prejudiced against foreigners, warms to this lovely family next door and their family, especially with Thao and his sister Sue. Things begin to escalate though and Walt is forced to kick it up a notch. Will the old man defeat a gang of 5 extremely buff Asians? See it to find out.A good movie with a kind of nice message. Lots of snicker-worthy jokes, generally based around his racist thoughts and old school ways. The scenes in the barber shop and the Hmong's home are especially good. Like I said, a tad of a stretch at times, but what movie doesn't have some slightly unlikely instances these days.A must for blokes and certain women will like too. FYI, it's #82 on the IMDb Top 250, just ahead of The Prestige and The Elephant Man.",8,0,3,28 January 2009
The Illusionist," Pick a card any card
","'The Illusionist' is a movie about an illusionist. The illusionist, Eisenheim (Edward Norton, one of the coolest actors ever) , was born in Vienna and as a young boy met a magician who showed him some cool tricks. He becomes fascinated with magic and decides to follow it as a career path (the movie is unclear whether he studied it at Uni or anything). As he grows up he forms a close relationship with a young girl called Sophie (Jessica Biel, who I've heard of but never seen in another movie, until I looked on IMDb.com and realised she's had bit roles in crappy movies such as 'Elizabethtown' and 'Cellular', which my friend Darren loved). Sophie is of noble blood and is strongly told not to hang out with Eisenheim, eventually seeing her taken away from him altogether. Eisenheim eventually runs away and travels the world.After many years he returns to Vienna to do some shows. His amazing tricks amaze everyone he encounters. One night he calls upon an audience member to volunteer and guess who it is? Sophie! Eisenheim becomes focused on getting back together with her and after an evening where they express their love physically he hatches a plan. It won't be easy though as Sophie is engaged and about to become a royal. Will the plan work? See it to find out.A great movie that keeps you enthralled and never misses a beat.

Wimbledon," Foot fault
","'Wimbeldon' is a not very good movie about Pete (Paul Bettany), a battler on the mens tennis circuit who comes across women's champ Lizzy (Kirsten Dunst, in her finest role since 'Spiderman 2'). They form an immediate spark after a chance meeting at Wimbeldon (I think this is where they got the name of the movie from) and soon begin to fall in love. The relationship does wonders for Pete's game, but messes with Lizzy's. Lizzy's dad (played by Sam Neill) soon interferes and things get tricky.Their story plays out kinda how you'd expect, but there's a few other annoying story lines that get thrown in that complicate things. Is OK for what it is, but not very interesting. If I had to use a tennis term to summarise, I'd say 'foot fault'.",5,0,1,19 January 2008
Dumb and Dumber," Dated
","Felt like some cheap laughs and don't think I'd ever sat through the whole movie, so thought I'd give it a go on it's 15th year anniversary.'Dumb and Dumber' stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as Lloyd and Harry, two complete losers who unwittingly get involved in a major incident when Lloyd tries to return a briefcase he thinks a lady whom he's fallen head over heels in love with has left behind at an airport. With little funds and even less brains, they travel across the country to return the briefcase, getting into many zany adventures and cheating death a couple of times.Has aged really badly, and has only a couple of laughs for those inclined to this humour, the best being the two diner scenes. The main actors do their bit, but the script is just a little too weak and lame at times and drags badly. Probably a test case for this sort of humour, but this one missed the mark badly, proved by the fact it didn't win any Academy Awards.",4,11,27,2 August 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Wow! A decent Tim Burton movie
","Normally I liken watching a Tim Burton movie to going to the dentist, but for the first time since 'Batman' i was pleasantly surprised.The original is legendary, so it was always going to tough work for Burton , but he did a solid job. The movie isn't an exact remake and is quite different in many regards, and surprisingly often for the better. There's a solid cast who all do a solid job. Many dedicated fans of the original were horrified when they heard Johnny Depp was playing the main role of Willy Wonka, but I feel he did a good job. It was quite a different Wonka than in the original, wisely, and Depp did a good job.I wasn't a huge fan of the second half of the original as the story really wanes, and not much was done to rectify this in this remake. This is one of the few flaws of this movie. Otherwise a decent family for the whole family.",7,0,1,7 May 2006
Big Fish," Better than expected
","Watched this somewhat reluctantly with wifey. Beforehand thought it looked a bit wish-washy, plus I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. Glad i saw it.The story focuses on Ed Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed, according to his stories, has lived an amazing, basically unbelievable life. In his travels he tells stories of giants he has befriended, finding a magical town, joining the circus to met his wife and so on. His son decides one day to start searching for the truth- are all his stories tall tales, is their some truth amongst them, or are they all as told? The movie unfolds really well, McGregor and Finney both do a great job. To my surprise it held my interest, and at stages amazed with the excellent cinematography. Worth seeing. My friend Gary won't like though.",7,1,1,6 January 2006
The Dark Knight," Not as good as 'The Dark Whopper'
","So Dean and I headed to Forest Hill Weds night to watch 'The Dark Knight'. Here's my controversial review.I'd been waiting to see this for a while, mostly because of how good 'Batman Begins' was but also because of the rave reviews of Heath Ledger's performance, apparently his best since '10 Things I Hate About You'. Went in expecting a truly classic cinematic performance...and i gotta say i was disappointed.The film starts out with a gripping bank robbery, done by some blokes in Joker masks. I got all excited when i saw William Fichtner as the bank manager who looked like he was going to foil the robbery, but alas his impact was minimal and he was soon dead. After his performance in 'Go', he shouldn't be taking crummy roles like that. Anyway we're soon shown the power and craziness of the Joker and his desire to be Gotham's master criminal. Yep, the Joker is chilling but in what will be an unpopular opinion, I reckon you could have put Screech from 'Saved By The Bell' in that make up, with those lines, and be about 80% as terrified. We're then introduced to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, in his best role since 'Double Jeopardy') , the District Attorney with no fear and free from any ounce of corruption and Gordon (Gary Oldman, in his finest role since 'Air Force One'), the squeaky clean cop who is hell-bent on bringing down the city's crime. The Joker realises he must take down Dent,Gordon, as well as Batman to take the city over and hatches a brilliant plan to do so. Will he succeed? See it to find out.Now it was an OK movie, but way way over-hyped eg it's listed as No.3 on IMDb.com's all time best movie list. That puts it ahead of some pretty well known and respected movies ie Pulp Fiction, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Casablanca, Psycho and Taxi Driver just to name a few. I thought it was a decent script, with an excellent cast, but the film just got to clever for itself at times, or at least for a Batman movie. Having said that I missed one or two key moments of the movie, probably due to agitation more than anything else ie that Gordon was driving the van with Dent in the back. I just thought it was weird that the driver wasn't talking and must have been a baddie. It was way too long, at least by 30mins and didn't have enough Bruce Wayne time.Solid, but I still prefer Batman Begins. Some will love it, some may think it was a tad overdone.FInally, ledger's performance was good but let's not get carried away and put it up with DeNiro as Travis Bickle, Al Pacino as 'Scarface', Anthony Hopkins as 'Hannibal' or Keanu Reeves as 'Johnny Utah'.",7,9,17,15 August 2008
Blood Diamond," Diamonds are a girls best friend, unless they're African
","Tara had been keen to see this for a while, so we got it out last night 'Blood Diamond' is a story based upon the ruthless diamond industry in Africa. It follows the story of Solomon, an African man who discovers a massive diamond while prospecting under duress. Word gets out about his discovery and he soon is tracked down by Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, in a much manlier role than 'Titanic'). Danny is a diamond smuggler and sees getting this diamond as his chance to get out of Africa.It's a powerful movie, giving great insight into the diamond trade in Africa. It shows us the horrific political struggles going on in parts of Africa and the devastation many people face. To be honest, some of it went way over my head, but it again hammers home the atrocities that go in this continent for luxuries to provided to the West.An excellent cast, spearheaded by Leo, as well as some amazing cinematography. Gripping. Worth seeing.",8,0,1,1 June 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Bit weird, but good movie
","Purchased this at the recent Big W sale, and rewatched Fri night with wifey. Wasn't expecting here to like much. She fell asleep about half way through, and she didn't seem to disappointed.'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' tells the story of a love affair between Joel (Jim Carrey, in one of his few non-annoying roles) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). The relationship eventually becomes very intense and after one big fight ends in Clementine checking herself in to have their relationship erased from her mind. Distraught, Joel decides to do likewise. During Joel's procedure we begin to piece together the two characters and the dynamics of their relationship.Very hard movie to explain, but worth seeing. Great cast, led by the fore-mentioned as well as Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood. The major feature of the movie though is the directing job done by Michel Gondry, which is groundbreaking. Most of his amazing work is done in the memories of Joel, and he tries lots of different things, all of which are brilliant. Amazingly he's done little else of note in Hollywood, mostly video clips including Bjork's 'Human Behaviour' and Massive Attack's 'Protection'.Must see.",7,0,3,15 September 2007

","One of the better movies of the millennium.Based upon a true story, Hopkins plays Burt Munro, an old man determined to set the land speed record for a motorbike in it's class on his old Indian. The movie commences with Burt having almost completed his modifications and ready to head to Salt Lake City to make his attempt. Along the way Burt faces all sorts of obstacles and oddities, but ends up reaching the salt flats to make his attempt.A great story, with Hopkins holding the movie up on his own shoulders. You hang of every one of his scenes, which is a big call as I don't recall him being off screen for more than 30 seconds. He even gets the accent pretty much down pat. Some good cameos, a great script. First class.",8,1,1,18 January 2007
There's Something About Mary," Funny
","Rewatched the other night with wifey.Saw this when it was released back in the 90's and thought it was brilliant. A lot of humour we hadn't seen before (and maybe some we wish we hadn't).'There's Something About Mary' tells the fictional story of a girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), who becomes an obsession for many guys. The film revolves around Ted (Ben Stiller), who went to school with Mary and as an older man decides to try to track her down. He hires PI Pat Healy (Matt Dillon, in one of his best efforts)to track her down. Healy finds her, but falls for her and consequently makes up a story to try to deter Ted from pursuing her. Ted still decides to however, and that's when things get weird.Some great scenes, particularly the interrogation scene and the 'zipper' incident. Great cast, some gold, but a fair bit of boundary pushing stuff as well not ideal for family viewing.",7,1,2,9 September 2007
Groundhog Day," Surprisingly good
","I previously thought this was a bit of an underrated movie, until i saw on IMDb it has an 8.0 average.The movie revolves around Phil (Bill Murray), a melancholy weatherman who one day realizes the futility of his life while down doing the annual 'Groundhog Day' story. When he awakes the next day, he eventually discovers he is reliving yesterday. The days keep passing, and he keeps finding himself back on that same day. Phil must decide what do do with that time, and work out how he'll possibly get onto that next day and the rest of his life.It's a good story and is supposed to make us think about how we live our lives. Murray is well supported by Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Worth seeing, with plenty of solid and funny scenes.",7,0,1,30 December 2005
Inside Man," Over-hyped
","Was more excited about seeing this movie than any other in recent memory. Sadly, was a little disappointed.'Inside Man' is your typical bank robbery movie, except it plays out a bit differently and has to do with a lot more than just cash money. The movie starts pretty much right at the hold-up and then takes us into a frenetic unfolding of their plan. These guys are good, and have a very complex plan. The police are quickly informed and set up outside the bank until the hostage negotiator (Washington, who is the glue that holds this film together) arrives. A cat and mouse game begins, and things start getting complicated when the bank's Chairman (Plummer, in his best role since 'Sound if Music') and a mystery business woman get involved.The film was building to a crescendo...and then deflated like a balloon a day after a kid's birthday party. A real shame. The first hour and a bit were good though and kept me entertained. Could have been so much more.",7,1,2,27 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," Landmark movie
","This is the first movie my friend Gary ever took me to see that left me feeling violated afterwards. In this case though, I knew I'd just seen something unbelievable.The movie has several stories going on that eventually inter-lap. The stories are told out of order, so it takes a fair while to work out what's going on, and only at the end can you properly piece it all together.Here are some of the great things about the movie: <ul><li>Revitalised John Travolta's career. He put in a top effort.</li></ul><ul><li>Samuel L Jackson's best ever role. He was funny, scary, cool.</li></ul><ul><li>Christopher Walken's cameo. Outstanding. Should have got nominated for an Oscar.</li></ul><ul><li>Excellent supporting efforts by Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Quentin Tarantino.</li></ul>The lowlights were: - The movie got nominated for 'Best Movie', but lost to 'Forrest Gump', which has to be the biggest injustice ever. Wasn't Forrest Gump just a movie about a guy they digitally inserted into famous historical moments? - Felt the drug use basically glorified drugs, which was a bad move - The 'Gimp' scenes. Not really necessary. Off-camera alluding to would have done just fine.But it's a funny, excellently written, well shot, brilliant movie",8,0,1,26 December 2005
The Untouchables," Solid story
","'The Untouchables' retells the story of Elliot Ness and his crew trying to bring down legendary gangster Al Capone.The movie starts with Elliot Ness (Costner, before he became rubbish) being appointed to head up a team trying to quash gangsters illegally tring to bring alcohol to Chicago. His major target is Al Capone (De Niro, given no where enough screen time), who has so far managed to elude anyone trying to bring him down. Ness doesn't know how and doesn't have the team to help him succeed. A chance meeting with a beat cop, Jim Malone (Connery, in another great job), inspires Ness that the job can be done and he makes his first point of business getting Malone onto his team. They decide they must get in outsiders due to corruption and enlist an accountant from Washington and a fresh out of the academy rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia, also doing a solid job,especially in one of the final scenes).On the way to bringing down Capone they encounter corruption,threats and all sorts of roadblocks. Will Ness get his man? See it and find out, unless you know even basic history in which case you'll know the answer.",8,0,1,5 May 2006
Mystic River," A trend is developing Mr Eastwood
","MYSTIC RIVER Our video shop has a great deal Monday-Wednesday (by the way, when will 'video shops' become 'DVD shops'). Hire a new release for $3.95 and get a free weekly. Great money for value.I'd been wanting to see this for a while, but knew the Mrs wouldn't be too keen. But due to the limited options in the store, I went for it.As the title suggests, there's a lot of mystique in the movie. In what seems to be an Eastwood trend, the story takes a while to get going, draws you in then surprises you and finishes with an all-too-familiar ending. The cast is superb, especially Penn. When Lawrence Fishburne is about the fifth billed actor, you know the acting will be A1. It's a good story too. So why did I only give it a 6? For me, the story just went too long, was way too drawn out and had nothing to surprise. And I gotta ask- would it have killed Clint to put a wacky guy in the movie, like that kid in 'Million Dollar Baby', without the bad bit. You know a local who cracks lots of jokes- maybe a barman or a postman or something? If you like good acting, you'll love this. If you like an impacting, powerful, gripping story, go hire something else.",6,1,3,19 October 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Now that's an hour and a half of my life I want back
","What rubbish!A married couple find out that each other is an assassin, and now they've been given the job of killing each other. What a premise!Forgetting how dumb that plot is, you'd think maybe you could make it pretty wacky, right? A few jokes here and there? Seeing as how the script is weak and Angelina Jolie is about as funny as a soggy piece of toast, this didn't work either. So what are we left with? A bit of action, which is also poor except for a showdown in the house.How could this have been better? Maybe replace Jolie with Janeane Garofalo, put some effort into the script, add some more support actors besides a wasted Vince Vaughn and you'd be getting somewhere. This will probably fall on deaf ears though as it was just another obvious CASH GRAB!!!!!!! The crazy thing was Jolie and Pitt had great chemistry, but maybe let's leave the comedy genre next time.",3,1,4,7 March 2006
The Departed," Good cast, good movie
","Had been waiting to hire this for a while, so was stoked when i dropped into 'Video Busters' and saw all but 2 copies were available.'The Departed' features one of the best assembled cats in recent memory. You've got your Jack Nicholson's, your Matt Damon's, your Leonardo DiCaprio's (who has gone from being a dork in films like Romeo & Juliet and Titanic, to a bona fide action/adventure/drama star), your Mark Wahlberg's and your Alec Baldwin's (in his best role ever). The story revolves around a gangster called Costello (Nicholson), who is untouchable. This isn't helped when Colin (Damon),a man who Costello has been a father figure to, lands a major law enforcement role and will only aid Costello in remaining out of danger. Also joining the force at the same time is Billy (DiCaprio), who lands a deep undercover job and sets out to trap Costello. From here it's a cat and mouse game as Billy tries to find who the rat is while Colin tries to find out who's the cop working for Costello.Great story, great cast, great direction (Scorcese, who amazingly won his first Academy Award for this, where the direction was a class under 'The Aviator' ). Well worth seeing, but not a family flick due to some potty mouth on behalf of pretty much the whole cast and some violent scenes.",8,0,3,29 April 2007
Glory Road," Another basketball movie
","'Glory Road' is based upon the true story of the Texas Western mens basketball team who won the 1966 NCAA Championship and created history along the way by starting 5 black players in an era when most black players languished on the bench.We follow the story from the hiring of coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas, in his best role since 'Poisedon'). With little budget, he decides to recruit predominantly black players, creating a storm along the way. We follow the racial tension his team endures and see them rise to champions.A great story, but not brought to life that well on the big screen. The main character, Haskins, doesn't actually get heaps of screen time, and we barely get to know any of the characters. The basketball action is OK, if not slightly unrealistic for the era they were playing in. OK for basketball fans with some spare times on their hands.",6,1,1,17 March 2007
Die Hard," Pioneer hostage movie
","Review: Die HardIt was 1989. I was waiting for the bus with my friend Nick on Currie St. We were making chit-chat when he started telling me about this movie he saw last night, 'Die Hard'. He went on to explain this amazing story about how a cop was in a building, trying to save a bunch of hostages. How he had all these funny lines like 'Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza' and so on. It's now 2005, and the impact of this movie is still felt. I may be wrong, but from what I know this was the first movie like this- a maverick battling against the odds to try to rescue some hostages all by himself. It's spawned a bunch of similar movies ( Air Force One, Passenger 57, Under Siege, The Negotiator etc). The movie still holds up pretty well. Here's some highlights:<ul><li>This was Bruce's first major role. Previously he'd starred in the decent TV show 'Moonlighting'. Exceptional transition. Imagine Ray Romano, the guy from Will and Grace or Bob Saget pulling this off. I don't think so.</li></ul><ul><li>Bruce's character's name: John McClane. Awesome name. Totally sounds made up, which is the key to a good movie name. Generally you can come up with a good name by combining two different people's names.</li></ul><ul><li>The contradictions in the amount of homework the terrorists did to storm the building. It was manned by 1 security guard, yet they had this real elaborate plan of breaking in. On the other hand they didn't know what the director of the corporation looked like. C'mon guys.</li></ul><ul><li>Bruce Willis holds and uses a gun more convincingly than any other actor. No competition.</li></ul><ul><li>That outfit Bruce ran around in for most of the movie was awesome (white tank top, brown pants, no shoes). Made the character. Wouldn't have looked half as good if he was wearing a tuxedo, skivvy and corduroy pants or jeans with a polo shirt.</li></ul><ul><li>This line: 'You broke in hear to access our computer?'. That is so 1989. (a) That seemed like a revolutionary thought at that time (b) these days you can hack into someone's computer from the comfort of your own home.</li></ul><ul><li>Always strikes me in these movies it's lucky the main characters talk to themselves and crack jokes to themselves, otherwise these movies could be really boring, and we would have no idea what's going on.</li></ul><ul><li>I'm learning lots from these movies about 'cop culture'. Here's some of the keys</li></ul>* You hate when the media rocks up, and generally the reporter * FBI and the local PD don't like each other. This i can understand. Imagine if at your work you're doing your thing and the national manager comes in and stops you and starts doing the job for you. * The head of the local FBI is generally an idiot. Normally the main character, who's a beat cop, can't believe the battle plan that's initiated. (The FBI guy's plan always fails too)",8,1,3,8 October 2005
The Holiday," Just alright
","We signed up for a Quickflix trial this week and this is one of the first movies we got.'The Holiday' features some of the world's finest actors, as well as Jude Law. The four main roles go to Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Kate Winslet. The movie revolves around a British and American woman who are having big relationship issues and decide they need to get away. By chance they meet on a house swap website, and impulsively decide to swap houses for 2 weeks. While they are there they both meet some intriguing men and relationships begin to form.At times there is some depth to the story, which is welcome as this genre lately has thrown out some trash, such as 'Prime'. A good cast, decent enough story...not too bad. Guys, you could sit through far worse.",7,4,4,9 June 2007
Wedding Crashers," A few good moments, but a let down
","Sent Wifey to pick out last night's DVD and she came back with 'Wedding Crashers'. Wasn't heaps keen to see it, but thought I'd give it a go.As the title suggests, the movie revolves around two best mates (Vaughn and Wilson) who crash weddings to pick up chicks. One day they decide to crash the biggest wedding in the country, that of a politician's daughter. While at this wedding both guys meet women who they decide they want to spend more than just one night with. Jeremy (Vaughn) meets Gloria (played by Isla Fisher, who used to be in 'Home and Away') who soon becomes infatuated with him and becomes very possessive and creepy. One of the politician's daughters, the taken Claire (Rachel McAdams, in her best role since 'Red Eye'), catches the eye of John (Wilson). Both guys end up getting invited to an after party and it's here they have to decide their next move.Overall pretty disappointing, thanks largely to an all over the place script. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a blokes flick? Was it directed by the Wayans brothers? It just goes of on too many tangents for my liking. It would have been far better off spending 15-20 minutes at 3 or 4 parties and them meeting the woman of their dreams. Instead we had about 1 mins footage of them at 10 different parties at the start and then the long drawn out story at the end with a bunch of interesting characters, most notably Todd, given nowhere near enough plot or screen time. Other questions:* How did Christopher Walken go from 'Deer Hunter'/'Pulp Fiction' to 'Stepford Wives'/'Wedding Crashers'? *What was the point of Jane Seymour's character? *How many great ideas did they not utilize eg Jeremy and Todd, the football game, Will Ferrell's cameo?Shame because this could have been way better.",6,0,0,25 February 2006
There Will Be Blood," There was blood, eventually
","'There Will Be Blood' is an epic, based upon the 1927 book 'Oil!'. I didn't know much about it going in, except that it had Daniel Day Lewis playing an oil tycoon. For me, that was enough of a sell. If Darren picked a movie to go and see called 'There Will Be Blood', I probably would have declined, but to his credit I picked it and he agreed, knowing full well it wasn't going to be up to his normal gory standards.I'd been wanting to see this for a while and knew an Adelaide visit presented a good opportunity. I checked out session times and it was only still being shown in 2 cinemas, very infrequently. I pre-booked some tickets online for the first time, meaning I'd get to experience what they show in the movie ads where you stroll straight up to get your tickets,lights shining on you and all the suckers who are waiting in line go 'man, we should have booked online. We're such losers'. Sadly it wasn't like this at all. The funny thing was when I booked they encouraged you to collect your 'pre-booked, allocated seating' ticket 30mins prior to the movie, which seems ridiculous. Luckily I ignored there I advice as when we got there there were only a handful of people in any lines, plus the cinema only had 2 other people in it.Anyway back to the movie. It starts with Daniel Plainview (Day Lewis) down a hole digging about. Then we skip forward a few years and he discovers the first of many oil wells. All of this (about 20mins in screen time) is done with no dialogue. Weird. Luckily I still followed what was happening. Soon Plainview has a small portfolio of oil wells and is doing very nicely. He starts to build a little empire, working with his adopted son HW, whom he became guardian for after his father died in a digging accident. One day while trying to gain some more land he gets an offer from a young guy about a likely potential boom area where he has seen oil seeping through the land. the kid asks for some money to advise where it is and Plainview agrees. He goes to check it out and discovers an absolute gold mine (in an oil sense). Plainview buys the land from the ignorant family, part of the deal being the establishment of a church on the lands so the son can start his own ministry. The rig is soon underway and the community is greatly enriched. From the moment the rig starts digging however, trouble upon trouble comes Plainview's way. Plainview starts to get a more sever mean streak, majorly affecting his relationships with the church, business associates and his family.I wont go on much more from here as it will ruin many of the subplots. Now to the review.First of all, your 'Fast and the Furious' types will probably hate it. It's set in the early 1900's and the story is slow at times. The story is rather intriguing and leaves a fair bit of food for thought. It's not what i expected, I had in my mind much more boardroom dealings and a fiercer pace, but the story just rolled on. The cast was outstanding, most notably Day Lewis as Plainview in one of the truly great performances of cinema, Paul Dano as Eli Sunday and Kevin O'Connor as Henry. A good story, perhaps a modern day 'Dances With Wolves', just a lot better. I didn't want to review it straight after as I was still a little bewildered, and three days later still am unsure how I felt about it. Certainly worth seeing though, probably not a great chick flick though.*As far as the violence, it's pretty moderate. For example, about half way through Gary whispered to me 'there's been no blood yet', to which I replied 'yeh, but I'm pretty sure there will be blood'.",Null,1,4,28 March 2008
Man on Fire," Denzel's Best Work
","Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. By the end of the movie, 'Man On Fire' had entered my top 10 movies of all-time.The movie has lots going for it. A great cast, a great story and great directing. At face value this movie is about an angry man trying to exact revenge. It's about so much more though- love, redemption, sacrifice...and more. There's some violence, sure, but I think this is one of those movies where it's required to truly reflect emotion. Definitely worth catching on DVD, which features an alternate ending (although it wasn't what i expected, still good). Definitely some of Denzel's finest work, up there with 'The Bone Collector' and 'Hurricane'. Good jobs also by Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony and Rahda Mitchell.",8,1,2,12 October 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Another Africa movie
","Had been pretty keen to see this as didn't know stacks about Idi Amin and this would save me reading a book.'The Last King Of Scotland' tells the story of Idi Amin, seen through the eyes of Nicholas, a fictional doctor who acted as his personal physician. It takes us from his entry to the presidency until the exit of Nicholas from Uganda. This unique perspective allows us to see the story from an angle you would rarely see it from (eg 'Hotel Rwanda').From the start wifey was perplexed as to the choice of Forest Whitaker, whom she thought had 'too warm eyes'. I advised her though of his apparent charisma, which was proved in the footage seen in the extras. I was focused on how he won an Oscar. Sure, he played the role really well, but not Oscar worthy in my eyes (then again, I don't think I saw any of the movies containing the other nominated actors).The story is fascinating, and certainly held my interest. Whitaker was excellent, but didn't receive much support from the rest of the cast. McAvoy (Nicholas) got on my nerves for some reason, and a more seasoned actor may have brought more to the role eg Ewan McGregor. The only other notable role was Sarah, played by Gillian Anderson, in her best performance since 'The X-Files' (hang on, she hasn't been in anything since. Boy did she fade out).Anyway, well worth seeing, and make sure you watch the extras.",7,2,6,29 June 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," More of the same
","Re-watched this the other on DVD as I hadn't seen it in a while, here's my review.'Anchorman' is the story of fictional 70's anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell), king of the news anchors in San Diego. The times are changing though and after Burgundy is unable to go on-air one night, reporter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate, in her best work since 'Married....With Children) fills in so well that she's given a co-anchor role, a first for a woman. Burgundy and his news team are dumbstruck and set out to sabotage her career, in the process doing themselves some damage too. Will they turn her off anchor work for good? See it to find out.OK, with some funny scenes but nothing extremely memorable, the highlights being Burgundy doing vocal warm-ups (make sure you see the extras disc), the news team fights (with cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller amongst others) and most scenes with Brick (played by Steve Carell). A bit too stupid in spots, as is the case with most Ferell movies, but enough jokes to make it easily re-watchable.",6,1,1,28 December 2008
American Gangster," The movie of 2008
","This was probably the most I'd looked forward to seeing a movie for 6-12mths. It was about gangsters, was based on a true story and had to 1st class actors in Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. Surely a 'can't miss'.'American Gangster' is based upon the true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), an African American man who secured a monopoly on the drug trade in the late 60's/early 70's by sourcing drugs direct from Vietnam. The drug problem in New York subsequently went out of control and the Government decided to set up a narcotics squad, headed by super honest cop Richie Roberts (Crowe). It takes Roberts a while to work out Lucas is the man he needs to bring down, but when he does he devises some schemes to bring him down.Brilliant screenplay which had me on the edge of my seat, with amazing performances by Washington, Crowe and the surprising Josh Brolin. Top it off with 'Can't Truss It' playing at the end credits and you had a winner. Only downer of the night was the two small drinks for $9.60. Mental.",8,0,2,14 January 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Dustin Hoffman saves face
","We decided on a back-to-back movie night this weekend, and aren't we glad we did.The night started grimly, with me finding out the Video Busters guys are handing over their keys. I knew something was up as the store range has been gradually decreasing and the guys just hadn't been as passionate. When I arrived last night, they were drinking beers with some goths and bogans. Odd. My fears were realised when I asked if they were closing up. The store is staying but new owners are coming in. I look forward to meeting them tonight when I drop off last night's entertainment.'Stranger Than Fiction' is one of those smart comedies that keeps you thinking and trying to work out the plot. The starting point is Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS agent who becomes nervy when it seems someone is narrating his every move. He starts to try to discover what's going on and unlocks some interesting clues with the help off a literary genius (Hoffman, in an excellent role, which almost makes me forgive him for 'Meet The Fockers'). Eventually he works out what's going on and is faced with a big decision.The movie is different and threw up some challenging thoughts at the end. Solid cast, most notably Ferrell, Hoffman and Gylenhall (the sister of the guy in the gay cowboy movie). Well worth seeing.",8,1,2,6 July 2007
Hancock," A bit annoying
","I recently won some movie tickets through work and with mum over, what better time was there to hit the pics. For once there were a few decent options to pick from, but fate (due to times) chose 'Hancock'.The movie begins with Hancock (Smith, in his most challenging role since 'Wild,Wild West') being woken on a sidewalk bench by a kid to go to the latest emergency- some punks shooting at everything in sight during a highway chase. We're quickly alerted to his amazing skills in a full-on scenario. He catches the baddies, obviously, and comes up with a creative way of stopping them. In the process he causes of $7million damage and this feat causes the city to put out a warrant for his arrest.Between the event and the warrant being issued, Hancock comes across Ray (Bateman, in his best work since 'Valerie'), a struggling PR guy who gets saved by Hancock in a near train accident. Ray befriends Hancock and goes to work trying to improve Hancock's image. When the warrant is issued, Ray convinces Hancock this scenario is a perfect chance to build a new Hancock. Hancock reluctantly agrees and starts to implement Ray's plans.Will it work? See it to find out.The movie started really well and the storyline was intriguing....and then about halfway through there was a twist which was really annoying and took the story somewhere I decided I didn't want it to go about 3 seconds into it. What could have been a really cleverly played out story just got wasted. It's almost like the original writer died at the halfway point of the script and some comic book nerd was put in charge and consequently derailed the movie.Potentially brilliant, but just OK in the end.",6,1,2,19 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the new installments
","REVENGE OF THE SITH For the first time since 'Return of The Jedi', I was unable to make the midnight session of a new Star Wars Installment. I saw it 21.5 hrs later though. Here's some thoughts on the movie:The opening scenes of the new installments are very exciting, seeing what new star ships they've come up with. That first scene was ridiculous though. There must have been over 1000 ships in shot..... Hayden Christensen must have had a busy 3 years or all the acting classes worldwide must have been full. Same 'ol, same 'ol.....Ewan Mc Gregor was one of the central characters, had one of the major speaking roles and still probably said only 30 words in total during the movie. He never says more than one sentence. When given the chance to say a few words to Anakin at the end, they were great.....OB1 must have hit the bottle hard in the 20 or so years between when he moved to Tatooine and first saw Luke again.....Joel Edgerton. Powerful performance..... Padme had the most boring pregnancy ever. Just walking around that room with no TV, no newspapers, no books.....R2D2 sure lost his cool moves after this movie. Flying, shooting stuff, doing flips.....The scene where Yoda walks in to confront Palpatine is the 3rd funniest Star Wars moment ever. ( 1. When Han Solo tries to reassure security everything is OK when they storm the control room in 'A New Hope'. 2 In 'A New Hope' where C3P0 tells Luke he's gonna shut down for a while)..... Samuel L Jackson should have played Anakin in this one and Hayden Christensen played Mace Windu. Who's better at playing a crazy yet controlled nut-bag? ( see Final scene of Pulp Fiction for proof. Not you kids under 18 though) ..... Jedi's way under-use their ability to make stuff break and fly at people.....If there is ever a clone army, we need to make sure it hasn't got a Kiwi accent..... The last 30 minutes of the movie are awesome. You just wanna go home and watch 'A New Hope' straight away.....George Lucas is a great storyteller but a terrible writer of the actual lines.....Awesome movie, best of the new 3..... At the end outside the cinema but in the complex an alarm was going off. Made me think how funny it would be if at the start of one of those midnight sessions, with all the people dressed up and everything, you set off a fire alarm right during the opening scene. How spewing would all the fans be having to leave the cinema and wait an hour.",8,3,5,15 October 2005
Defiance," I came for the accent attempts and stayed for the storyline
","Had been keen to see this since release, so I could learn about this amazing story and also see Daniel Craig and Liev Screiber talk in a German accent for 2 hours.'Defiance' is the amazing true story of 3 brothers who aim to provide protection for fellow Jews from the Nazis trying to capture them and force them into concentration camps. The group starts small in the forest but eventually word spreads and they soon have a small army in their hands. Eventually they become a community and form tight bonds, but the cold, uncertainty and frequent struggles just to feed people causes plenty of struggles. As time passes on, the challenges mount and their leader (Craig) faces leadership challenges and excruciating decisions.An inspiring, amazing story of one of the greatest stories of the second world war. Not overly gripping as a movie, but obviously not too much creative license was taken.",6,0,2,12 September 2009
WALL·E," Cute robot, bad film
","'Wall-E' is a movie about a kooky little robot. Due to problems on earth related to waste, all the humans are evacuated and put onto ships to escape until life on earth is safe (I actually missed the first five minutes as I was making popcorn but this is what I was told). Wall-E's job is to compile and clean up all the waste and ends up becoming the last thing left on earth (besides a cockroach).One day a weird robot is dropped onto Earth and seems very hostile towards Wall-E. We soon learn this robot called EVE is on a mission to find life forms. After 700 years of these robots being sent to earth without success, EVE eventually finds a plant situated in Wall-E's little container. She grabs it and is collected to return to the mother ship. The leader on the ship is stunned at EVE's success as this means a return to earth is possible- but not all seem to want to go home. Will the crew onboard, who have all got fat and lazy return to earth or will they live as they have been happily? Totally not what i expected from the movie. Not really a kids movie I would have thought as the message is too complex and it's excruciatingly slow at times. Strangely it ranked at No. #37 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time. I read the most rated review and came across this, which troubled me.....WALL-E is such a lovable character. I've never felt so much emotion for one character. He will definitely go down in history as iconic as Darth Vader, or Indiana Jones. I was so close to crying at pivotal parts in the film, and although I didn't fully break out and cry, I have never felt so much emotion in my heart with any other film as I did with this one.Ah, that person needs to get out to better movies.

","Had been keen on seeing this for a while, but knew Wifey wouldn't be a fan. At the video shop though i really felt this and 'Deja Vu' were the only real choices, so I went with this.'The Good Shepherd' follows the life of Edward (Damon), a young scholar who joins the fledgling CIA. We follow him from his days at Yale through to the Communist threat. What I expected to be a gripping, thrill-a-minute movie turned out to be about as interesting as peeling vegetables. It just dragged and dragged. I'm all for long movies, but only if the action and suspense warrants it.Matt Damon was OK, but for some reason the director (my acting idol, Robert DeNiro) put no effort into the aging process of him or Clover (Angelina Jolie), which was strange as he played a 20 something up to a 45 year old, which was really bad when his 20 something son looked only a few years younger than him.Some of the cast, especially John Turturro (in one of his better roles, up with 'Mr Deeds', 'Rounders' and 'Desperately Seeking Susan') , was wasted, and the espionage side of things was rarely thoroughly explored. Disappointed.",6,3,5,7 July 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," They don't get much better than this
","Like most people I saw this movie (a) on the advice of a friend (b) on video. I knew very little about it, but was told 'it's awesome'.The movie is built around Andy (Robbins) a real innocent man, sent to prison for the alleged murder of his wife and lover. He finds the going tough in prison ie the food is bad, his cell awful, sodomy, but he soon learns what it takes to survive. Just when you think 'oh please don't' turn into Tom Selleck's 'An Innocent Man'', you are thrilled to see the movie take another direction. Some acts of kindness win some of the inmates over and he soon finds a close ally in Red (Freeman). Andy goes about making a difference in prison and instilling hope into the lives of his friends. I won't go much further but it's fair to say I've never met someone who has seen this and not been impacted. This movie is what Hollywood should be about- and it was originally written by Stephen King! Get the Special Edition DVD for some excellent bonus features, most notably a parody that is extremely clever.",9,0,0,30 December 2005
Music and Lyrics," Guess what? Hugh Grant played a lovable fool
","Was wifey's birthday, so we headed of with our free tix to Knox to see 'Music & Lyrics' The movie is about a washed up star from the 80's, Alex Fletcher (Grant), who is living in the past and living off his fame by playing small-time gigs around the US. One day he is given the chance he's been looking for when he's asked to write a song for and perform with Cora, the hugest female star in the world.Alex has always been great at melodies but has struggled with lyrics. Enter Sophie Fisher (Barrymore), who while watering his plants one day helps with a line or two and things go from there.Alex and Sophie come up with a great song and present it to Cora, who also thinks it's great. Problem is, she wants to 'mix' it a little. Will they go for the changes? Will Alex and Sophie form a romantic relationship? Will they both learn valuable things? Nothing great, pretty standard romantic comedy. Gets to 6 because of the awesome 80's song 'Pop Goes My Heart' made for the movie, plus the song written by Alex and Sophie.",6,0,0,31 March 2007
Back to the Future Part II," Best of the three
","When I saw this movie at the Cinema as a teen in blew me away. I was so exited and intrigued after seeing it, I went and hired the original just so I could work out and relive all the story lines from the original.The movie picks up where 1 left off. The Doc has to go to 2015 to solve some of future Marty's problems. When Marty disregards Doc's implicit instructions, things go haywire, causing all sorts off extra disasters that catapult the guys back into 1955.There's lots of clever retro themes, some great lines and the story is action packed. Look for the cafÃ© 80's scenes, which technologically were amazing when they first appeared.Unfortunately there was a third installment in the series, set in the wild west which was just woeful. It nearly ended in disaster in real life for Michael J Fox too, when a hanging scene went horribly wrong and Fox came within inches of losing his life.",9,0,1,22 October 2005
The Queen," Majestic
","'The Queen' is a story about the Queen. More specifically, it focuses around how she and Buckingham Palace handled the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana.The film begins with the introduction of the new Prime Minister Tony Blair (well played by Michael Sheen) to Her Majesty (brilliantly played by Helen Mirren, in her finest work since 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'). In a surprise to me, this occurred just before Princess Di was killed, bringing the two figureheads into close relationship very quickly. The two have differing opinions on how to handle the aftermath of the tragedy and Blair soon finds himself needing to be very forceful to avoid the Royal Family becoming a target of scorn. Blair manages to convince the Queen, reluctantly, to make an appearance and a speech in order to save their reputation.The film cleverly intertwines real-life footage of the events, most notably where the actors are 'CGI'd' into original footage. The insight into the Royal Family is fascinating, and more so to the Queen (eg she drives a little jeep around the property). The cast is great, most notably the fore-mentioned plus James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. I wasn't expecting much of the film, but really enjoyed the way it was done plus the walk down memory lane. It brought up lots of surprises eg that Diana was only 36 when she died and that the Queen knew how to drive a jeep and use a mobile phone.Well worth seeing.",7,0,1,9 April 2009
Raging Bull," Brilliant movie, with 1 of the top 5 performances ever by DeNiro
","Hard to sum up in words, but much easier than summing up in hand signals Robert DeNiro + Martin Scorsese + Great Story + Brilliant Script = One of the best movies ever.'Raging Bull' tells the true story of Jake La Motta, an early 1900's boxer who went from champion to bum. The story begins with his rise in the boxing world, where his talent is obvious but equally is his womanizing, anger and paranoia. As he rises to champion, things go well for Jake, but when problems arise his character flaws bring about his downfall.A must see for true movie lovers. An outstanding performance by DeNiro, even better than his effort in 'Analyse This', who famously put on over 70lb for the role for La Motta's later years. Also great performances by Joe Pesci, in his breakthrough role before 'Home Alone', and Cathy Moriarty. Outstanding directing by Scorsese, who created the most realistic boxing scenes up until that time, with the black and white effect really adding to the movie. One of the great Hollywood movies.",9,2,2,19 February 2006
Bruce Almighty," Good stuff
","Generally I go and see Jim Carrey movies with about as much excitement as a visit to the proctologist, but this movie looked different. (Please note I liked The Truman Show and moments of Ace Ventura).Bruce (Carrey) is fed up with life, continually getting shafted by people and his dog. After one big outburst and a cry to God, he finds himself face to face with the Creator (played excellently by Mr Class, Morgan Freeman). God decides to let Bruce have a go at ruling the world for a while while he takes a break. Bruce is obviously initially wary, but as he soon discovers he does indeed possess incredible power, except to change free will. Bruce starts off fixing his life, but soon discovers it's not all about him.A well written and well done movie. Carrey does a solid job, with plenty of great lines and scenes, the highlights being the the 'I've got the power' sequence, ruining Evan's news reading carrer and his sudden ability to land scoop stories.Well worth seeing. A good comedy with a good message that makes you think about God's place in our lives.",8,0,1,14 January 2006
Casino Royale," A new Bond
","Saw this after seeing 'Quantum of Solace', which was a dumb idea but didn't really have a choice. Here's my review.'Casino Royale' brings us a new Bond, Daniel Craig, who is a 180 from all the previous ones. He's cold and calculated and not very funny, but the ladies still love him.This movie sees him try to halt a fund raising attempt for a terrorist organisation that involves playing 'Texas Hold 'Em' (my dream). Of course Bond is good at most things and cards is certainly on the list. Along the way there's lots of chases, fights and explosions, many better than anything we've seen in any movies, let alone the Bond franchise. There's many memorable scenes including an attempt to blow up a plane, a chase on a construction site, a drink spiking and a memorable scene.....well it involves Bond's nuts and a special whip, but it's not sexual.Don't wanna give to much away but it's a great film, heaps of action and no-one would walk away unimpressed. Make sure you see it before seeing 'Quantum of Solace' to save some confusion.",8,2,4,27 December 2008
Space Jam," A movie I'll make my kid watch so he subliminally decides to get into basketball
","I saw this at the cinemas when it came out with a bunch of my homies...a scary thought.The movie (I'm reviewing this as if it was an ordinary movie) revolves around the pending basketball match between the Looney Tunes characters (Daffy Duck, Road Runner, Tweety Bird etc) and the characters from Moron Mountain. You see Moron Mounatin, located in outer space, is struggling for patrons, so the boss decides to try to kidnap the Looney Tunes guys. In a shrewd move, Bugs Bunny manages to stave off the kidnapping by getting them to agree to a basketball match to decide their fate. If his squad loses, the Looney Tunes characters move to Moron Mountain as entertainers forever. If they win, they are free. Sounds fair. But then the Moron Mountain squad decides to play dirty and goes and steals the talents of some of the NBA elite. The Looney Tunes manage a coup of their own, signing up the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan. The teams train and prepare for the biggest games of their lives. What will be the Looney Tunes fate? See it and find out! Entertaining enough, but pretty cheesy. Some good cameos from some NBA stars (Barkley,Ewing etc) and some entertainment greats. Confusing a bit for kids, but they'll get it in the end.",6,2,2,19 February 2006
The Deer Hunter," I guess it's not a movie based on the video game then
","Robert DeNiro is my favourite actor, but I'd put off seeing this for a while. When all you've heard about a movie is 'it's depressing', you generally don't rush to your local video store.The movie focuses around Michael (DeNiro) and his friends who leave their small country town to join the Vietnam War. These wacky, starry eyed guys get into something they had no idea about. Soon their lives are turned upside down by the horrors of war, and each is impacted in a different way. Michael eventually makes it home but struggles to cope with how much his mates have been impacted.It's a well done movie, with no typical Hollywood rubbish that you generally see in these type of movies. A strong cast, also featuring Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep, ensures this movie keeps the drama.Not exactly laugh-a-minute, yet I still found it funnier than 'Analyse This', so.....Thjose seeing this hoping to see lots of deer hunting action will be disappointed, bit if you like 'Russian Roulette', you'll be stoked.",7,0,1,23 December 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," This movie is full of hacks, literally
","For about the fifth time in my life, headed out solo to go and see a movie. I settled on 'Die Hard 4.0' at Croydon Cinema for $6.50.Walking in, the cinema looked OK, good seats, if anything just a slightly overbearing popcorn smell. As I was early played some 'Pinball Delight' on my phone while waiting for the main attraction. Within 10 minutes we were on.The movie revolves around the theme of what would happen if computer hackers got control of some really important government and financial computers. It sure was a fascinating concept, I just hope computer hackers don't go to see it and get bad ideas and instead of trying to email people viruses try to take over the world. The central characters are Bruce Willis (as John McClane), who looks older but still has the crazy moves and side-splitting one-liners and Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, in his best role since that Windows vs Mac ad series), as a computer hacker who just might be able to help. Behind the hacking is Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant, who looks like a mixture of Vince Vaughn and Billy Bob Thornton), an ex-Government computer brain factor who got peed off when he was fired for being too brash.The premise is good and the action is outstanding, with some amazing scenes and fight sequences (my favourite being in the power station). It dragged a bit at the end as we waited for McClane to just catch the bad guy already, but overall it was pretty good for what it was. Perhaps 1 or 2 too many totally implausible scenes, plus I got obsessed with watching how McClane's blood marks changed during scenes. I think I speak for myself and my 4 other fellow patrons when I say that as far as action goes, you won't find much better.",8,1,3,16 August 2007
Munich," It's not really like Jaws or ET
","Knew what I was in for when hiring this, and probably was about what I expected.The movie retells the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics, where 9 Israeli athletes were killed. The majority of the film revolves around a group of 5 assigned to track down and kill the Palestinians who executed the murders.Spielberg claimed at the time of release that this movie doesn't side with either group, but puts the story out there for us to make a decision. I certainly feel the movie leans towards the Israelis, which is no great surprise considering Steve's origins. It certainly doesn't glorify revenge, but it also doesn't show many repercussions for the Israeli assassins.As usual the directing was great, the cast solid, but not spectacular, and the sets were excellent. Not overly gripping but was pretty good for what it was.",7,0,0,7 July 2006
Heat," Best movie ever!
","20 reasons why 'Heat' is the best movie ever1- Best cast for a movie ever. How's this for a cast: Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brennemann, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Tone Loc, Jeremy Piven, Mykelti (I have the coolest voice ever) Williamson, WIlliam Fichtner2- Love movies where the main character can beat up people twice their size, in this case Neil McCauley beating up Wayne Gro a few times and Henry Rollins. Close runner up would be Ed Norton beating up DeNiro's bodyguard in 'The Score'3- Pacino explaining the first crime scene. It's so good you can overlook the amount of things he says that would be obvious to cops but not to us, the naive viewer (the exits, how they knew the average police response time etc). Not done as well in 'The Day After Tomorrow' when scientists explain basic weather information that many movie goers wouldn't know. It would be like in 'Rocky' if the trainer said 'Hey Rock, you gotta knock him out before the 12th because that's when the fight ends'.4. Al Pacino never saying 'goodbye' or 'ok' to end phone calls. Looks so cool just hanging up at the time you feel like it. I tried it a few times on friends but they no longer talk to me so my technique obviously needs some work.5. Neil McCauley's routine to pick up Eady at the bar. If you've never gotten a date, try this.6. Al Pacino's couple of screaming rants. Bill Simmons said about Pacino is his piece on DeNiro v Pacino that all of his characters in the last 10 years have basically been like the one he plays in 'Scent of a Woman'. Lots of silly yelling and screaming. The best one in this movie is probably 'Gimme all you got!' in his ridiculous conversation with Albert.7. The cameos in this movie. The best ones being Henry Rollins , Jeremy Piven and Tone Loc.8. The quote: 'Have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat coming around the corner'9. How creepy the diner manager is. He'd be awesome in 'My Restaurant Rules'10. When has the 'cop pursuing likable criminal' not worked? My second favorite movie of all-time is 'The Fugitive', so. Even 'US Marshalls' is watchable purely on this premise. Oh hang on, theory ruined, I forgot about the Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones one, 'Double Jeopardy'.11. Another McCauley quote 'I'm talking to an empty phone...There's a dead man on the end of this line.' Try it on a telemarketer sometime for a laugh.12. Vincent Hanna talking to Kate about why he doesn't talk talk about his work. Great Pacino work. She holds her own too, except that haircut ruined her character for me.13. The fact the movie seems to be around bank robbers but really is all about relationships. Watch from about the 56min mark for 10 minutes and see how it goes right into them. The movie has them all. The dead relationship between Kate and Vince, the blossoming relationship between Neil and Eady, the roller coaster ride of Chris and Charley and lots more.14. One of the few action movies with cops ever where no-one over rides the man in charge's orders. It's pretty much a staple of cop movies these days. See 'The Negotiator' and 'Con Air' for the worst offenders.15. Pacino quote: 'Who..Who...What are you a %$^&*( owl?'16. Neil's suit.17. 'The Scene' with Vincent and Neil having a chat over coffee. Both guys are almost having an 'act-off' (like the 'walk off' in Zoolander). Forget Shakespeare, aspiring actors should watch and rehearse a role from this scene and they'll be set for a huge career.18. Pacino Quote: 'I'm very angry, Ralph'19. The directing of Michael Mann. Visually stunning movie.20. The Shooutout. Awesome cinema. Once again, look past the fact the layout is absolutely ridiculous (see Kilmer standing in between two ends of wall to wall cops and shooting one way and then the other)",9,4,9,8 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Landmark movie
","I first saw this as a child on TV, back in the days when movies took 1 year to come to video and 3 to get on TV. It fascinated me then and still amazes me now.The movie is without doubt the cornerstone to the best sci-fi/fantasy series ever (I'm assuming because I haven't seen Lord of The Rings). Star Wars, really Episode 4 in the series, introduces us to some of the most fascinating characters ever to hit the big screen.The movie begins with us meeting a kidnapped Princess (Leia- Carrie Fisher). We then jump across to a young boy out buying some droids (Luke Skywlaker- Mark Hamill). Eventually these stories intertwine as Luke becomes involved in trying to rescue the Princess. Along the way we meet many pivotal characters, see some groundbreaking visual effects for the day and get engrossed in a brilliant story.Highlights of the movie include a storm trooper running into a door ledge, Han and Chewie in the control room, OB1 and Luke in the bar, the budding relationship between Leai and Han and lightsabres. The movie is legendary and worth seeing if you're one of the few who hasn't. I rate it 3rd in the set of 6.",8,1,2,5 January 2006
Click," A bit weird
","Picked this up expecting a pretty average, zany Adam Sandler comedy. It was for about 30 minutes, then went really dark.The movie is built around the premise that Adam Sandler gets a remote control that lets him pause, fats forward and rewind etc his life. I'm sure you're thinking of hilarious situations he could get into already. After about half an hour though his remote automatically goes into auto search and he skips 'chapeters' of his life and witnesses the fall of himself. Won't go into detail but the movie turns from a wacky comedy into food for thought about our lives and how we live them.Thought provoking a times, with some OK gags, but probably not what Sandler fans would hope for.",6,0,1,18 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the series
","As a youngster certain parts of this movie creeped me (training with Yoda, the opening) but as I've matured, or at least got older, this now is easily my favourite movie of the series.The story obviously continues on from Star Wars, with the Rebels trying to defeat the Dark Side and Luke furthering his new career as a Jedi Knight. The movie takes us to Cloud City, one of the best destinations in the series, where we meet the coolest character in the franchise- Lando Calrissian, played brilliantly by Billy Dee Williams. We also see some brilliant battle scenes up here, including the face-off between Luke and Darth Vader.I won't say much more about it, but this episode to me is clearly the best- the best writing, the best story, the best dialogue and the best action.",8,1,2,30 December 2005
Gangs of New York," Martin Scorcese sure hates short movies
","Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio star in this epic, retelling the early days of the struggle for New York City.Lewis stars as 'Bill the Butcher' a patriotic local who runs the Five Points, a treasured piece of local ground. His name is 'Bill the Butcher' because he is a butcher, literally, but he doesn't restrict his carving skills to animals, if you get my drift. Most are scared of him and get out of his way. SInce he defeated Priest Vallon and the Irish in 1842, things have been easier for him. That is until 'Amsterdam' (Di Caprio), comes into town. He strikes up a relationship with Bill, but it's obvious he has a past (because all people have a past), but his past is special because his dad was.....'The Priest', who Bill killed in 1842!!!! I'm not usually a huge fan of period pieces, but this was pretty solid. A great cast, also starring Liam Nesson, probably in his finest work since 'The Phantom Menace' and Cameron Diaz, in probably her best work since 'The Mask'. Lewis steals the show though in an outstanding performance, and is solidly backed by Leo.Warning: there's some strong violence, although I must say it's not as bad as I'd heard.",7,0,1,26 November 2005
Coach Carter," Ah Sammy Jackson, you've done it again
","When you put one of my favourite actors in a movie on my favourite sport, you know I'm gonna be happy. And I was- delighted in fact.Great adaption of this true story about a high school basketball coach who benched his team because they were failing their subjects. Jackson is great as Coach Carter, probably one of his best roles ( see also 'Pulp Fiction', 'Coming To America', 'Die Hard With A Vengeance') and the cast of unknowns also does a solid job. The basketball action is good, the practice sessions are brilliant and the school stuff is also done well. May have been good to see some more behind-the-scenes relationship stuff but as a whole the movie is enjoyable and impacting. Definitely worth seeing.",9,1,1,22 October 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Brilliant
","Took wifey last night to 'La Premiere' (the Hoyts version of Gold Class) to see 'Slumdog Millionaire'. It's pretty similar to 'Gold Class' except you get complimentary soft drink and popcorn, which is a pretty sweet deal, but you don't get a reclining chair (which sucks) and you sit with others along a balcony which is overseeing where the poor people sit. One of the highlights of the night was watching the poor people work out how they got upto our seats. I wanted to shout something insulting to them, but I'm pretty humble.The movie was excellent. It's about a boy named Jamal who gets to the last question of India's version of 'Who wants to be a millionaire'. The movie starts with him being interrogated the day before he gets to the last question as the host of the show is suspicious he's cheating, especially because of the fact he's a 'slumdog'. We then retrace Jamal watching the video of the show with the police and him telling stories about how he knew the answers.It's a brilliant idea for a movie (based upon the book 'Q&A') and played out well as the story was so good. The cast is really solid, especially when it follows Jamal, his brother Salim and friend Latika as little children. The cast is really good, the cinematography excellent and the story is a masterpiece. Don't just take my word for it though- it won the Golden Globe for best picture and is No. 34 on the IMDb.com Top 250, 3 spots ahead of 'Wall-E'.2 amusing side notes.1/ About half way through mum rang me (she was babysitting) asking how to get the sound back on as Isaac had fiddled with the TV set-up. Isaac then turned the power off 3 more times, meaning it took me 10mins to explain o mum how to put the TV on, the stereo on, foxtel on and the dvr set-up.2/ During the week, Andy Maher was on SEN saying how brilliant it was and even the more remarkable was that it was a true story. One caller phoned in and told him it wasn't and that he thought it was based on a book but Andy countered that the book must have been based on a true story. Then another guy phoned in and reviewed the book as he'd recently read it, then Andy started to back down from his stance and seemed rather crestfallen.",8,0,2,24 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will's best
","For the first time in ages, I went to the video store at opening time to try to get a popular new release. I was there a couple of minutes early, and noticed the video store guy sitting outside the bakery next door. He had two 'V's' on the table and was staring into a pie. He didn't looked ready for a 12hr shift at the video store. I walked in after 11 and to my surprise saw 'The Pursuit Of Happiness', which I didn't realise was out. I'd wanted to see this for a while so i was obviously delighted.The movie is based upon the true story of Chris Gardener, a struggling salesman who takes a punt on an internship at a local brokerage firm. The punt is that he won't receive a salary for 6mths (in real life though he did get a minimal amount)and has to put in many hours of work and study to ensure a decent chance at landing a job. We follow Charles from his struggling sales job, through his marriage breakdown and into the internship.It's a simple story, but kept me interested the whole way through. Smith was perfect for the role and carried the film on his shoulders. The film is inspiring and probably will get you thinking about some things in your life. Excellent.",9,0,0,26 May 2007
Goodfellas," As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster
","GOODFELLAS Yesterday I decided to pull out 'Goodfellas' from my video shelf and have another look. I don't reckon I'd watched for at least 3-4 years and I couldn't remember the ending, which makes it almost like watching a new movie. Here's some thoughts:-The first thing that strikes you about this movie- 'Based On True Story'. You've got to be kidding. But it's true, I found out some interesting stuff on the net. -You know you're in for a semi-violent movie when the opening shows a man being stabbed and shot in the boot of the car and the narrator saying 'As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster' -Fortunately some of the violence is portrayed pretty light-heartedly, such as the postman being beat up and told not to deliver any more letters from the school to a kid who does errands for the mob. -This movie features all the guys you'd expect to see in a mafia movie. I'd bet most of those guys have never played anything other than 'mafia guys'. At least there's a fair bit of work going for them, although it has died off since 'Donnie Brasco'. -Not one of his best roles, but another great mafia movie for Robert DeNiro. Seems his mafia movie roles got more and more pleasant, ending up in that guy in 'Analyse This', which I deny was ever made. -Funniest scene of the movie: when Henry walks out of the court as a kid. -2nd funniest scene: When the guys are on their way to bury a body and drop by Tommy's mum house to get some tools and end us sitting down for a big pasta meal. -Look for the very small cameo by Samuel L Jackson. man he had some short, rubbish roles before cracking it big time.",8,0,3,15 October 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Up a notch from 'The Bourne Identity'
","Caught this on Ch 10 last night. Here's my insightful thoughts: The 2nd of the Bourne trilogy, 'The Bourne Supremacy' see Bourne back on the run. While enjoying life with his girlfriend in India, a mysterious man comes into town with a killer look in his eye. Turns out he's an assassin sent to kill him. Bourne escapes, but his girlfriend isn't as lucky (ie she gets shot, then drowns). Bourne starts doing some hunting and discovers he's got a huge price on his head. Bourne finds out what's happening and who's after him, but will he escape? See it to find out (but I'll give you a hint, the new Bourne movie comes out this month, and Matt Damon's in it,so.......).Once again excellent action, with some great scenes, most notably in the interrogation room and when he tracks down the the first Treadstone guy. First class action.",8,1,2,17 August 2007
Cinderella Man," Howard and Crowe deliver another 'knockout'. (Thankyou, thankyou very much)
","Been waiting to see this for a while and was very happy with the result.Cinderella Man retells the true story of Jim Braddick (played brilliantly by Russell Crowe), a boxer who starred around the time of the Great Depression. Braddick rose to prominence before the depression until he was beset by injuries and soon became a real battler. Braddick soon goes from riches to rags as he is forced from the ring and into normal society where he struggles like everyone else to find work and feed the family. Braddick and his family of three kids and wife (Zelwegger) soon can't pay the bills and struggle to put food on the table. Braddick is soon given a second chance when a boxer is needed at the last moment for a big fight due to a last minute pull out. No-one wants the fight with the lack of preparation, but Braddick will do anything for some extra cash. Originally this was supposed to be a one-off fight, but when Braddick shockingly wins things become very different. Will he get another shot? Will his family survive the depression? See it, or read a boxing history book, but the movie is pretty good and you should see it.",8,1,1,7 May 2006
Valkyrie," Ich bein ein gutsy
","For the first time in recent memory, I was overwhelmed with choices when I popped into 'Video Busters' last night. There was plenty for me, but also a decent range left that wifey might be interested in too. Being a long weekend, I got a stack of videos and for the overnighters grabbed this and 'Revoltionary Road'.'Valkyrie' is based upon a remarkable true story of a group of brave men who attempted to assassinate Hitler and seize power of Germany during WW2. That has to rank as one of the gutsiest things to attempt ever. Heading this group is decorated war hero Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise, in his finest work since 'Top Gun'),perhaps the most important Colonel ever behind Colonel Sanders. The plan is reasonably complicated, but if they can pull it off, they will see Hitler and a bunch of his key men killed and a coup occur where the SS will be shutdown and the country can be placed in safe hands and will consequently surrender to the Allies. It won't be easy though. The plan relies on being able to get key army people to be willing to commit treason and to get Hitler to unwittingly sign a document that will essentially enable the coup to occur should he be killed. Tricky. Will The Colonel pull it off? See it to find out.Reasonably well done, except for the fact everyone spoke English and without a hint of a German accent. That made it seem a bit weird. Cruise was OK at The Colonel, but there would have been about 50 better actors they could have used eg Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks or Sean William Scott. Amazing story and well worth seeing.",7,0,2,5 June 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Ordinary- as expected
","Went into this expecting not a whole lot. Some of the recent TV-movie adaptions (South Park, X-Files, in which I fell asleep etc) were terrible. This proved to be no exception.The plot revolves around Homer dumping some pig excrement into a local river that causes a massive overflow of pollution. The EPA decides to place a dome over Springfield so that it well never harm the outside world again. The Simpsons manage to escape the dome, but when they hear of a plot to blow up Springfield, decide (eventually) to return and try to save it.As you'd expect a few OK jokes, but the storyline was just terrible. It had to be a big story, but this missed the mark badly. They should have done this with the 'Who Shot Mr Burns' story or even the brilliant 'Behind the Laughter' episode. Too many key characters given little screen time (Moe, Ralph,Mr Burns, Skinner etc) and too many potential story lines not explored enough ie Flanders and Bart. I started to get restless it was that boring.D'oh.",4,2,4,12 August 2007
High Fidelity," In my top 5 movies about record store owners
","'High Fidelity' is built around record-store owner Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a guy who's hit a mini-crisis and decides to track down why his relationships with women have turned disastrous by contacting his long string of ex-girlfriends. He makes up a Top 5 list (something he does frequently) of his most damaging relationships and tracks these women down. In the middle of this he keeps running his snobby record store with pals Dick and Barry (Jack Black, in his breakout role).The film is all about a man on a journey discovering why he's become the man he is and making decisions to change his future. This is all good, but the film will be remembered for it's focus on making mix tapes and Top 5 lists (the best of which are 'Top 5 Monday morning songs' and 'Top 5 best first tracks on an album'). Good laughs and an interesting story.",7,1,2,16 June 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Way better than I expected
","As with most comedies these days, i went in expecting a few decent gags and that was it. Pleasantly surprised.'Talladega Nights' follows the driving careers of Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) and Cal Naughton Jnr (Reilly). Bobby and Naughton Jnr have been best mates for life and together achieve their dream of racing together in Nascar. They do anything to help each other..... as long as Bobby wins. Their lives get turned upside down when Bobby has a crash that freaks him out and damages his confidence behind the wheel. Will Bobby get back to the top? Will Naughton Jnr step out of Bobby's shadow? The humour is kind of what you'd expect from Ferrell, but I liked the style a lot more in this movie than 'Anchorman'. It's quirkier and they let they aren't afraid to go for the harder laugh than the easy crowd pleaser. One of the top 5 comedies since 2000. Must see.",8,0,2,20 January 2007
Semi-Pro," Semi-funny
","Figured the holiday was a great time to catch this movie, which I wasn't overly excited about, but thought it would be something to do on a lazy afternoon.Got to the cinema a tad early and sat down and played some golf on my phone. About 10 mins in and I was the only one there. Awesome. Sadly about 5mins later two losers with no friends walked in, making it a cosy cinema of 3.The film starts with a pre-game intro of the Flint Tropics, a struggling team in the former ABA basketball league. We learn from the get go that Jackie Moon (Ferrell, in a role not much of a stretch for him) is the team owner, promoter, coach as well as a player. Jackie brought the team on the back of his one-hit wonder 'Love Me Sexy' and is in it just for the fame and fun. Before too long Jackie finds out his team will absorbed by the ABA-NBA merger...unless he can get them in the Top 4 teams. Jackie goes out and signs (from a trade for a washing machine) Monix, played by formerly good actor Woody Harrelson in a minor attempt to tun things around. Soon he makes some other changes, such as agreeing to let Monix become coach to get his team into the NBA. Will it work......? See it to find out.There's some more good quirky Ferrell humour, but this isn't a classic. The story had a lot more potential but in some circumstances went too oddball and weird and missed some good opportunities, probably largely due to the extra screen time given to Ferrell. Give him a few better support comedians and this could have been a classic. They missed some great opportunities with the basketball action too. One of the early scenes was gold.....but then after that very little was paid attention to.",6,24,47,12 May 2008
The Godfather," The Godfather of movies
","Rewatched this for the first time in about 12 years. The last time I saw it I don't think I was ready to appreciate it's brilliance, as it was a tad slow for me back then. Glad I did.There's no real point reviewing it, basically most people know what's it's about and know it's universally regarded as one of the best movies of all-time. Here's some reasons why.-Brando as Don Corleone. Brilliant -Pacino as Michael. Brilliant. -The directing of Coppola. Brilliant. Beautifully shot movie with some landmark scenes, most notably Sonny's death and the restaurant scene. -Excellent storyThe movie holds up very well, albeit it's a bit slow at times. Here's 3 scenes that could have been improved.-Michael moving his father in the hospital. Should have been some guys inside who Michael had to fight off. -When Sonny beats up Carlo. Really poorly done. -The restaurant scene. Didn't use the suspense enough, could have drawn out some more.A brilliant movie, must-see for major movie factors.",9,1,2,24 June 2009
