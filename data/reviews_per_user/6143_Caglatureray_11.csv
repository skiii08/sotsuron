Ford v Ferrari," Loved the story
","Yes I love car racing, but I am impressed by how the story is crafted. It's not Ford vs Ferrari, but it's more about real people like (Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby) against corporate micromanagers who just want obedient corporate-slaves (aka 'team-players') instead of value-adding (and a bit protruding) individuals. the history has been so perfectly portrayed in this movie. the emotion of Ken Miles at the end just before he slows down the car, it's an excellent scene... such an unforgettable hero.. and it's great that this movie reminds us once again about the 'bad' people (i.e. Leo Beebe) in this world. nobody applauses this loser right?",10,2,3,22 February 2020
The Irishman," I fell asleep!! Disappointing
","What's the hype behind this movie? It's just a boring, dull story about another gangster. So far so I fell asleep and my spouse got extremely bored watching it. Slow and definitely not keeping the attention of the audience. We like gangster movies but this one failed miserably. Although the actors did an ok job it was also not really amazing either. Why does Robert De Niro play himself both young and old. It doesn't portray well. He could have stuck with the old and someone else should have acted the young. For the sake of the good actors this movie gets 5 from us. If this movie gets any awards, it would be because of the support behind Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. ( definitely not because of the movie) plus these guys are good actors yes but they can only act similar roles/characters. A super perfect actor is the one who can act / portray various different characters. So in that sense Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are always the same mafia guys... it doesn't add on anything to the movie industry.",5,1,5,2 January 2020
The Irishman," Below expectations! What is the hype behind this movie??!!
",Actors are playing ok. The story is a bit boring. So dull. What is the hype behind this we couldn't figure out!!! Also Robert De Niro playing both young and old versions of himself do not really portray well. They could have found someone else to act the young version.,5,1,5,2 January 2020
Molly's Game," Fascinating incredible
",How come this movie received no oscars? This proves again Oscar awards are just given to people who lick the asses of some notable people. Anyways one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. And Jessica C. Is the queen of acting!!,10,6,9,6 January 2020
Molly's Game," My favorite movie
",One of the best movies I have ever seen!!! (And I watch a lot of movies ) it has become my favorite since I watched it last week.,10,4,8,11 September 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Way below my expectations
","I like Tarantino movies. My favorite movie ever is kill bill! So my expectations were high for this movie.
I like Leo di Caprio movies, everything he acts he turns into gold. (So did he this time as well. Perfect acting by Leo.)
I'm ok with Brad Pitt. (He sometimes acts great but mostly he is in average movies. So this one he got lucky because Leo was in it. Brad Pitt himself also acts pretty awesome in this movie.)
But yes there is an overall disappointment because I expected much more from this movie. Imagine me being a top fan of tarantino and Leo. I had high expectations and I'm quite disappointed with the overall story line: I tried liking it, even watched some parts again but I couldn't get myself into liking this movie. Things do not get connected until the very end and it feels it's all over the place. The only thing that makes it watchable is Leo's acting!
Moreover it's a twist to the truth at the end. People who actually died in real life end up to be alive in the movie. This twisted truth is most probably being named as 'art'. Still I think most people should watch this movie because of the big names involved.",5,2,2,17 December 2019
The Lion King," How could BeyoncÃ© ruin one of the most beautiful songs ever ??
","How could BeyoncÃ© ruin one of the most beautiful songs ever ?? When she sings 'can we feel the love tonight' , I could hear her breath more than her voice. What type of bad singing was that? Completely disappointing !! (Movie and image quality are great, but I didn't like the music quality at all) by the way, John Oliver and Seth Rogen were great!!",7,4,5,12 October 2019
The Lion King," Beyoncé and music quality 1.
",She was not able to sing one of the most beautiful songs ever !! I could hear Her breathe 'ha ha ha' but her voice was lost. Music quality is really bad. (The image quality is great that's why I give 7.) but I wish they had just chosen someone else rather than Beyoncé. There are so many talented girls out there!,7,1,3,12 October 2019
Joker," Best JOKER acting EVER!
","Amazing acting! This guy deserves all the awards !!
J. Phoenix portrays Joker in an amazing way and it locks the audience in this emotional drama/tragedy. Great casting, wonderful compilation of music, amazing acting ! What can we say? He deserves the academy award in every possible way .",10,3,5,1 January 2020
Black Panther," Why is this movie so overrated ?
","I am against discrimination. But I honestly think this movie is overrated just because there is a black super hero! ( It's also a bit discriminating towards all others that there were only black actors but ok it's not the topic here)... 
I hardly could stop my husband to go to the movies because he said there are really good reviews. But after seeing it, I wanted to check IMDb. And I wish I checked it earlier... so many people have already written my thoughts. So many 1 stars... 
well, it's your choice of course so no spoilers from me...",1,6,9,17 March 2018
The Island," Good movie
",Good movie with bad ending. Why do the clones need to live ? Why the real people need to die? They made this ending just to be politically correct!! That's why ending is not what I expected. But it's a fiction right ?,6,1,1,11 January 2020
