Skyfall," This movie was not the best!
","I found this film to say the least, not the best bond film ever. this was to me a bit of a let down I started to see Daniel Craig as James Bond after Quantum of Solace he for filled the void of what used to be James Bond in that film. in this film he was lost between all of the different Bonds and I say this in the nicest way possible but was a bit of a try hard. its unfortunate that there will be another two bond films that will turn out like this but unfortunately i will fall into the trap of going to see a main stream film, lets hope that they actually decide which bond they want to portray him as and do it well.overall the movie had a decent film plot that was easy to follow but was generally pointless.",3,6,14,19 December 2012
