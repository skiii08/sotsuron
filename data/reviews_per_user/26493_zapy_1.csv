Raiders of the Lost Ark," SPOILERS WARNING Made me wanna be Indy himself even when the angels made belloq explode!
","WARNING SPOILERS
Indiana jones might as well be the best movie series ever. everything was perfect. the writing was a pure stroke of geniousity excuse the spelling. the casting was wondeful i would  not have rated it so high if Harry wasnt in it!  The camera angles were awesome. I LOVED the part when the Nazi's explode. thats the best EVER! considering im 44% Jewish.
HIGHS: cast writing camera angles directing(could the team be ANY better) action the beggining bar scene. EVERYTHING!!
LOWS: uh i felt queasy when Belloq exploded",10,0,0,13 June 2001
