The Blair Witch Project," Claustrophobic, Atmospheric, Creepy, Well-Acted Are All Words To Describe This Terrifying Chiller!
","The first time I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' was when I was 13. I had fallen asleep within the first 45 minutes. I had been extremely disappointed. Now, I had heard about how 'Paranormal Activity' is one of the creepiest horror movies of the year. I thought that if I'm going to see 'Paranormal Activity,' then I'd better watch this movie again in order to know what I'm in for. After a second viewing, I admit that 'The Blair Witch Project' is absolutely one of the creepiest horror movies I've ever seen.Shot like footage, 'BWP' follows three student filmmakers shooting a documentary: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. Heather is the head director of a documentary about the infamous Blair Witch of Blair, Maryland. After many strange and eerie stories of the witch, including the tales of over seven children being kidnapped and found dead, the three teens are pretty skeptical that there really is any witch living in the woods of Burkitsville. As they venture into the woods to shoot their film, strange things happen, things that they never thought would happen. Things that are going to tear them apart emotionally. Heather, Josh, and Mike discover that the Blair Witch might be more than just a legend.'The Blair Witch Project' opens as a seemingly ordinary documentary-style horror movie. But there is plenty to love about it. As the movie progresses, it unfolds with a horrifying tension, with an event just as frightening as the one before it. Also, the Burkitsville woods are a perfect atmosphere for the movie. The camera kept closing in on the cast, and it produced a strong feeling of claustrophobia. Whenever I heard a noise in the background, and one of the filmmakers would scream 'What the **** was that?!', I kept turning my head back and forth to see if there was anything there. 'The Blair Witch Project' is a very good example of 'What you don't see is scarier than what you do see.' The movie gives excellent performances by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams. The most iconic moment of the movie, with Heather turning on the camera and making a tearjerking apology to her family and the others, is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the movie.'The Blair Witch Project' was a movie with a very low budget of 11,000 dollars. And after a lot of hype, audiences ran to the theaters and were scared out of their wits, bringing in over 5, million dollars in a weekend. The movie had beaten out the box-office record that was held by the horror classic 'Halloween.' This movie takes a rather simple premise and goes a long way with it. It's scary, eerie, claustrophobic, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. 'The Blair Witch Project' is perfect psychological horror.P.S. Don't watch it at night. Plus, the climax is gut-wrenching.",10,2,4,17 October 2009
Black Swan," Black Swan: A Beautiful and Frightening Bird
","Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of Darren Aronofsky's previous film, 'The Wrestler.' So, I was at first hesitant to see Aronofsky's latest film, 'Black Swan.' But as soon as the praise started tumbling in, I decided that I HAD to see it. So far, I'd call 'Black Swan' the best movie of the year.The film is about Nina Sayers, a young ballerina living with her mother Erica, a former ballerina herself. Nina strives to be the best in her New York ballet company. Her director, Thomas Leroy, announces his production of Swan Lake(a classic ballet), and since legendary Beth McIntyre is retiring, Nina is given the role of the Swan Queen(aka The White Swan). However, she must also portray the Swan Queen's evil twin, The Black Swan. As of now, Thomas knows that the Swan Queen will be no problem for Nina, but she struggles immensely with the Black Swan. In comes competition by the name of Lily, a woman who is strong, carefree, and very sexually expressive. As Nina strives for perfection, she experiences pain, sexuality, paranoia, and obsession that slowly drives her to the edge.Now, here is a story that could have been riddled with clichés. But no. The script, written by Mark Hyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLoughlin, is extremely well-written and filled with surprises. At times, we aren't sure if what we see through Nina's eyes is true. Of course, her slow loss of sanity is visible. But is Lily really out to get Nina? Is Thomas really exploiting his dancers sexually?'Black Swan' is definitely a horror film, and that may be hard for other people to view it as such. Nina's descent is nightmarish and truly horrific. When I watched the film, I recalled the styles of early Roman Polanski(i.e. 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby'), David Cronenberg(i.e. 'Shivers' and 'The Fly'), and even Dario Argento('Suspiria'). Nina's paranoia is like that of Catherine Deneuve, and her bodily horror certainly brings to mind that of the early Cronenberg films. Several horror fans will think of 'Suspiria' right away when they watch 'Black Swan,' knowing that Argento's film is also about ballet. But Aronofsky's film is also beautiful and lavish, like Argento's style. The character of Nina fascinates me. In our eyes, she is a frightened little girl in a woman's body. She is afraid to express any sexuality, mostly because of her controlling mother. She wants to be perfect, and reach higher than those of her cutthroat partners. Perfection and pressure leads to her madness, and it is heartbreaking as well as shocking.Of course, the script and the direction are key to the film's effect, but it is the cast that, to me, makes the movie. Natalie Portman's performance as Nina is absolutely stunning. Portman has done many roles that never allow her to grow as an actress. 'Black Swan' shows that she can do anything, and she has grown into her own. Thomas is played by Vincent Cassel, and he gives a very memorable performance. Barbara Hershey is also outstanding as Erica. It is told to us that Erica gave up ballet to have Nina. Nina has grown a bit, and Erica is afraid to see that. So when she sees her daughter struggle for perfection, she represses her a lot of the time. Hershey captures that to a T. You will also see a nice performance from Winona Ryder as Beth. For the time she has on screen, Ryder is quite good. But the big surprise here is Mila Kunis as Lily. Known more for crude and light-hearted fare(TV's 'That 70's Show' and 'Family Guy,' and the hit film 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall), you would never expect Kunis in a role like this. She is not the voice of little Meg Griffin anymore. She is an actress, and her performance here equals that of Portman.Director Aronofsky has given us what could be his most ambitious and beautiful film yet. He has worked with a flawless script to form a truly amazing film. 'Black Swan,' in itself, is an intense drama about the pressure and struggles of the ballet art. However, it is definitely, and maybe not to some people, a psychological horror film, and a great one at that. If anybody deserves the Best Actress Oscar this year more than anyone, it's Natalie Portman. 'I just want to be perfect,' says Nina. Poor Nina's pressure makes her suffer, but the movie sure doesn't. 'Black Swan' IS perfect.",10,2,6,25 December 2010
Monster," A Monstrously Powerful Movie
","In the late 80's and early 90's, roadside prostitute Aileen Wuornos killed seven men before going to trial and being executed in 2002. We have seen our share of 'Lifetime' TV dramas and biopics about serial killers, but this story is a particularly hard one to tell. Patty Jenkins and leading lady Charlize Theron have done that with 'Monster.' On the verge of suicide and left with only 5 dollars in her pocket, Aileen walks into a saloon, which she quickly registers as a lesbian bar. Along comes the shy Selby Wall, a lesbian who is living with relatives who hope to cure her of her change in sexuality. Soon enough, Aileen has found her soul mate in Selby.On a night out turning tricks, Aileen is raped and beaten by a man, but then shoots him to death and takes his money. From then forth, she has sealed her fate and goes on to kill more men.First time director Patty Jenkins wrote and directed 'Monster' not as a study of a murderer, but as a tragic look into the mind of a woman who has found no hope for herself in life. At times, we feel sympathy for Aileen, especially the first time she kills someone. But as her victims grow more innocent (even when her last victim tries to help her but is killed anyway), we don't know what to feel. Maybe we aren't supposed to feel anything for Aileen, but just to know who she is and what she's done allows us to connect with her. She is a monster, as the film's title tells us, but also a broken creature who has suffered enough in life to the point where she can't love and can only respond with anger and violence.There's no argument about it. Charlize Theron has given the performance of her career. As great an actress as she is, this is the role people will remember her most for. It's not just the makeup transformation Theron goes through (I didn't even recognize her in the film). She becomes Aileen Wuornos. Her body language, her twitching eyes, the way she brushes her hair back, the way she holds a cigarette...Theron is gone and Wuornos is ever prevalent throughout the film. This was an Oscar well-deserved, and no one will ever be able to match Theron's portrayal.Christina Ricci's performance as Selby tends to be the one thing people don't agree with about the film. This isn't bad acting that Ricci gives us, but a rather accurate portrayal of this girl. Selby's naivety and shyness is broadcast nicely by Ricci, no matter what the critics may say.This movie could have taken the easy way out and simply studied Aileen Wuornos as the so-called 'first female serial killer.' But when you are able to make a movie that observes such material as a love story and an account of a brutally damaged soul, then that is a triumph. Thanks to Theron and Jenkins, 'Monster' is that kind of triumph, a film that will stay monstrously powerful for a long time.",10,1,2,4 June 2011
The Others," The Others: A Return to Classical Supernatural Horror
","Nowadays in horror, it isn't enough to simply hint at a ghost. The audience is going to want to see the specter in the flesh. But that takes away the true fright of supernatural terror. The feeling of an otherworldly presence is much scarier than seeing it. After such classics as 1961's 'The Innocents' and 1963's 'The Haunting,' a film like Alejandro Amenabar's 'The Others' is a warm love letter to horror.The film is set in 1940's New England. While her husband is away at war, Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, watches over her dark, foreboding mansion, as well as her children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a disturbing allergy to sunlight. Once Grace calls upon new housekeepers to tend to the mansion and the kids, things begin to go wrong. There is something the new guests aren't telling her, Anne is 'lying' about seeing a little boy named Victor, and strange noises occur. But Victor isn't the only problem. There are others, uninvited guests that can't be seen. Is the house haunted or is Grace's sanity string beginning to loosen? 'The Others' is, without a doubt, an extremely frightening horror film in a repetitious world of serial killers and nude blonds. It got attention when it was released, but today, I feel like its popularity has unfairly faded.The film has an ominous feel right from the start. There is nothing happy about this setting. You can already tell that Grace is unhappy, and since her husband is gone and her children's lives are at stake, she is always on edge. The mansion is completely darkened, and leaving a single door open can bring in sunlight and trigger an effect on the kids. But in such a case when a door is left open and nobody has touched it, we, as an audience member, develop paranoia and fear of the characters' surroundings.Back in the day, not seeing a ghost was, and still is, more terrifying. Masters like Jack Clayton and Robert Wise knew that, and so does Alejandro Amenabar. We don't see a single apparition. Amenabar favors implication over shock, something Hitchcock would be proud of. It is an old formula brought back to fantastic life.Although atmosphere is a highlight of 'The Others,' the casting of Nicole Kidman is equally powerful. She is beautiful as well as talented. Her performance sponsors a realistic fear, which is a mother's loss of a child's love or even the loss of a child. Bring ghosts into the mix, and you have a perfect recipe for psychological horror, thanks to her performance.The ending is definitely a more common cliché currently than it was in 2001, but it still brings chills. And so does the rest of the movie. Paying homage to the classical horror films of the 1940's, 'The Others' knows what truly scares you, and I hope one day, that it won't be a film just for older audiences, but for newcomers who have been raised on slasher movies, also.",10,1,3,6 August 2011
The Terminator," Smart, Creative, Cool Sci-Fi Action Thriller That Never Gets Old!
","'The Terminator' is the movie that made James Cameron a star, and the same goes for Arnold Shwarzanegger. This is a film that is creative, smart, strange, and entertaining, and it always has the same impact each time you watch it.Sarah Connor is a happy woman with a good life. That is, until some weird, strong bad guy tries to hunt her down. The only person who can protect Sarah is Kyle Reese, a soldier from the future. Reese is in the present time because he has been sent from the future to save Sarah from The Terminator, the wacko cyborg that's been trying to kill her. The Terminator is here because Sarah is the future mother of John Connor, the young boy that will save mankind from the apocalypse. There's not too many ways to stop The Terminator. It can't be reasoned with, you can't shoot it down, it shows no pain, and it won't leave Sarah alone until she is dead. Now, it's up to Sarah and Kyle to do everything in their power to survive, and stop The Terminator dead in his tracks.'The Terminator' is one of the most perfect sci-fi thrillers, complete with wonderful direction, a very original story, a terrific cast, a bad-ass villain, and some of the hippest special effects of the 80s. The film never becomes cartoonish, which is what other sci-fi movies become. The character of The Terminator becomes creepy at times in the fact that you can't stop it.The cast is flawless. Arnold Shwarzanegger is superior in the role that made him a star. Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn are also very good as Sarah and Reese. You will also catch a cameo from an early Lance Henriksen as a cop.The verdict: You're going to laugh at this, but I had never seen 'The Terminator' until just recently. I'm glad I did. This is the movie that gave birth to the careers of many famous people, and it has a bunch of famous quotes. 'The Terminator' is the invention of the original sci-fi action thriller. 'Come with me if you want to live!'",10,1,2,20 September 2009
Once," Once: A Revolutionary Turn for Movie Musicals
","Campy and energetic are two words that come to mind when one thinks of musicals. 'Sweeney Todd' and 'Les Miserables' fall into a different category. But who says a musical has to be cheesy? What if we can watch a musical and not leave the theater dancing, but thoroughly mesmerized and stunned? John Carney's 2006 Irish film 'Once' proves that.Our two main characters are extremely natural. They don't even have names; they are labeled Guy and Girl. Guy is a street singer, banging away on his guitar and belting out ballads he composed himself. He only gets minimal attention, but then, Girl comes along and listens to his music. She is not from Ireland, but she is Czech, and Guy's music immediately grabs her. After fixing up Girl's crappy vacuum cleaner, they both wind up sitting down together and creating music. She plays piano, he plays guitar. But as they compose their songs, a love story begins to develop.Before we get to the main reason this movie is so amazing, let's look at the characters. Both Guy and Girl are leading flawed lives. Girl lives with her mother and her baby, her husband away while Guy is alone after being dumped by his girlfriend. When they sit down together, they're not just making music. They're making love. Their affection for one another simmers inside of them through their songs. Is their love admitted in words? No. But that's not really the point of the movie, or the music wouldn't have as much meaning.The soundtrack is the key to the film that all movie buffs are going to criticize after all the hype the movie has gotten over 6 years. The music is actually composed by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, our leads, and it is beautiful. None of these songs are toe-tappers, but aching, soul-touching ballads that get under the skin in the most positive way possible. The meeting of Guy and Girl results in 'Falling Slowly,' a piano and guitar piece that is marvelous in its emotion and soothing in its sound. It perhaps may be one of the best love songs not on the radio, and that's a fact since the song got an Academy Award. The one that will really make you tear up is Irglova's heart-breaking tune 'The Hill.' The score demands to be heard.If I were to come up with one word to sum up 'Once' overall, it would be simplicity. This entire movie is beautiful in its ways of being natural, from a story so simple to the undeniably improvised chemistry and appeal of the leading characters, played wonderfully and effortlessly by Hansard and Irglova. It has stood the test of time and is quickly starting to reach the mainstream. How: it's now a critically acclaimed Broadway musical. There's no doubting you're going to love this film. Such a classic and influential movie with such a triumphant soundtrack only gets made 'Once.'",10,3,3,1 April 2012
Alien," Alien Is A Classic!
","'Alien' is set in the future, in deep space, on a ship called the NOSTROMO. We are introduced to the seven members of the ship's crew: Dallas, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, Parker, and Lieutenant Ellen Ripley. Using the help of 'Mother,' a piece of technology that helps them guide the ship, the crew slowly makes their way back towards Earth. However, they stop the ship when they find another in the middle of space. There, they find a strange organism, an alien species that is far beyond their knowledge. But that's when the species escapes onto the NOSTROMO, infecting Kane, who gives birth to a baby alien that was bred inside of him. As the alien grows and runs amok, the crew is slowly killed off one by one, leaving Ripley. Can she save herself, destroy the organism, and find a way back home? I'm usually not a big fan of movies about space monsters. 'Godzilla' just doesn't do it for me. However, 'Alien' is more than a monster movie. In fact, I don't think I can even consider it a sci-fi film. To me, it feels more like straight horror.Scripted by Dan O'Bannon from a Ronald Shusett story, and directed by Ridley Scott, the film has a tremendous atmosphere. Knowing that you're stuck somewhere with no place to go lends an unbelievable sense of claustrophobia and tension to 'Alien.' Also, you see much more of the monster towards the end of the movie. For most of the time that you're watching the movie, the alien is kept in the dark as it roams the ship. It could be anywhere at anytime, and it's smart. Actor Rider Strong of 'Cabin Fever' says that 'it's much more frightening when something's intelligent and evil.' The monster in 'Alien' is a prime example.You also have an A-list cast, featuring Tom Skerritt as Dallas, Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, and John Hurt as Kane. But once the movie gets going, the real key to the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Her character knows when something's dangerous and should be left alone. But when nobody listens to her, and they all die, she takes control and she doesn't go down without a fight. Weaver perfectly portrays Ripley, and she has created an ideal heroine, like Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode of 'Halloween.' Ridley Scott directs the film with passion and dedication. He gives us all sorts of wonderful shots, some being shaky and raw, putting fear in the audience and setting a mood of unease. It's safe to say that Scott was the best choice for the job.To this day, 'Alien' holds up extremely well. It hasn't aged at all, and doesn't show signs of it happening either. The film is filled to the brim with heart-stopping suspense and truly shocking scares, especially the ending. Thanks to great direction, a very original story and screenplay, genuine tension, a classic gross-out moment, and the iconic performance of Sigourney Weaver, 'Alien' is, was, and ever shall be a flawless definition of what a monster movie should be. 'In space, no one can hear you scream!'",10,1,3,19 February 2011
The Thing," Another winner from John Carpenter!
","Putting 'The Thing' into my DVD player, I knew that I was in for a great horror film. After all, it's John Carpenter, the man who brought us such classics as 'Halloween' and 'The Fog.' My expectations were correct, and this 1982 spook-fest wound up being one of the creepiest horror films of the 80s.Doing a special project in Antarctica, R.J. MacReady and his crew discover something hidden beneath the snow. It's what appears to be some kind of a ship, something believed to be dated more than 100,000 years old. MacReady and the others should have stayed away from the remains of that ship. Because now, there is an evil, alien force lurking around the base, taking form of the crew. The Thing could be anybody, and it's up to MacReady to find out who the next victim is.'Halloween' has always been John Carpenter's scariest movie. What sets his other movies apart from his masterpiece is that they focus more on creeping the audience out than officially scaring them. No doubt, 'The Thing' is a very frightening film. But why is it so frightening? There's plenty of gore in it, but Carpenter also wants to make the viewer very uncomfortable. Instead of scaring them, he creates the most horrific sense of paranoia anybody could imagine. The Thing could be anybody, and I found myself guessing who would be the next to fall prey to the alien force. The movie is very unpredictable, and I was on the edge of my seat.The cast is very well-chosen, with great performances by Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Masur, and more. These are sympathetic characters, and I never wanted any of them to die.One word I can say for Rob Bottin's special effects and makeup is: amazing. The moments when The Thing attacked were strangely believable, and I could feel the effects. Points to Bottin for creating superior effects.An awesome cast, a great story, a terrifying sense of paranoia, and remarkable special effects make 1982's reimagining of 'The Thing' another winner from the master of horror.",10,0,1,5 September 2009
The Shining," The Shining Shines!
","As entertaining as horror movies are nowadays, several of them are much more violent than those in the early years. A perfect horror film doesn't need gore, sex, or a guy with a knife, although many directors have been able to do something original in their films('Scream,' and Saw' being prime examples). All you need is a great cast, the right director, and the ability to create unbelievable suspense and tension. 'The Shining' defines what a perfect horror film should be.Jack Torrance has been assigned the job of the caretaker during the snowy winter at Colorado's prestigious Overlook Hotel, and he's lucky enough that he gets to take his wife Wendy and clairvoyant son Danny with him. While they're snowed in for months on end, Jack gets to work on the book he's been writing while Wendy keeps Danny occupied. But Danny has other things on his mind. His power of 'the shining' distracts him from his family and leads him to discover the many secretive horrors of the hotel, including the death of the previous caretaker and the murders of his family. And how come Jack's been behaving so weird lately around his wife and son? Everybody knows that 'The Shining' was based on the bestselling novel by Stephen King. The 1980 film version only sticks very loosely to the book, but the obvious changes director Stanley Kubrick makes in the story enhance the film in its own way.You know right away that the Torrance family has domestic issues, since Jack takes the job while he's still in minor recovery from his emotional alcoholism. So when he begins to lose his mind, you don't know whether to think that the horror of the film is Jack's psychosis or the haunting of the hotel. But knowing that this family is far from safe right from the opening shot makes you all the more scared for them.Kubrick's direction gives the film a tremendous atmosphere. Even the tiniest details can give you the shivers, whether it's Danny riding his bicycle over the wooden floors of the hotel or the immense size of the hedge maze outside of the hotel. The bicycle scenes, especially, find some way to freak you out. The sound effects of a wheel meeting a wooden floor and then tracking over a carpet over and over again sends you a message that something isn't quite right. Kubrick's camera angles also tell so much. Watching someone walk through the hotel from behind gives off a message that we're being followed, and nothing is what it seems.A tremendous sense of claustrophobia is felt throughout the film as well. The Torrance family's cabin fever scares us more than it scares them since we are snowed in with them for the entire film, and there's no way to get out.Filmmaker John Carpenter, director of 'Halloween,' once said that the horror films he makes are usually about the area in which you are set. The Overlook Hotel is, of course, key to 'The Shining's' effect. As you continue to watch the movie, you realize that it almost feels as if the hotel is watching and waiting for you, and the hotel's appearance becomes just as creepy when you feel that it becomes a major character in the film.The performances of the cast are a huge highlight of 'The Shining.' Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance has become a bigger role for him than that of his Oscar-winning role of McMurphy in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,' mostly because he's just so damn terrifying. People don't know whether to believe if his performance is over-the-top or if he's not acting. Whatever it shall be, Nicholson scares you plenty. Shelly Duvall does a wonderful job as Wendy. What an actress! She doesn't even have to mutter a line of dialog. Her facial expressions tell you everything. The look on her face during the 'all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy' scene is probably just as frightening as the moment itself.In the end, what hasn't been said about 'The Shining' that hasn't been said already? It is one of the most disturbing and nightmarish horror films ever made, and one of the most quotable ones. Rob Zombie says 'You meet so many people who say 'Nah. I don't really like horror movies. But they always love 'The Shining.'' That could be a fact. It's not only a flawless exercise in terror, but just a flawless movie. Period.P.S. I don't know what's scarier. Those two creepy-as-hell twins in the hallway or Jack Nicholson bursting through a bathroom door with an ax, howling with maniacal glee 'HEEEEEERE'S JOHNNY!!!!'",10,0,1,13 March 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: Another Winner From David Fincher!
","The lights dim, the movie begins with a brief prologue, and the zany and incredibly weird opening credits begin, set to a creepy cover of Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song.' From the beginning, we are in for a wild ride as Stieg Larsson's incredibly popular novel 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is brought to life on screen.Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger, a very wealthy man, while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an answer to the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, which occurred over 40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead, and that she was murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander, a dangerous but intelligent 24 year-old punk who is an accomplished computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other crimes. Together, Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark, eerie journey into a world of crime, Nazism, and corruption that will lead them to Harriet's assassin.I walked into 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' with almost no knowledge of Larsson's novel or the Swedish film made a few years before David Fincher's version. The end result is ultimately an extremely satisfying, brutal, and complex thriller thanks to great direction by Fincher (known greatly for his work on 'Seven,' 'The Game,' and 'The Social Network'), excellent writing, and an impeccably chosen cast.After only a few years, the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an attention-grabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the love-it-or-hate-it 'Twilight' series. And we can understand why. After all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life, Lisbeth doesn't take any crap from anybody. She may be angry, violent, overtly sexual, demanding, and perhaps a little crazy, but she is a genius at what she does, and has reasons for all of her actions, no matter how gruesome they may be.The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and white-knuckling, adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We're not sure of who is Harriet's killer, or if Harriet is even dead, until the last half hour of the film, and when we do find out the twist, it leaves a stupendous impact.After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers, and surprising us with 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' and 'The Social Network,' David Fincher was the right man for the director's chair. Every film he makes, even a drama like 'The Social Network,' sets up a tone of genuine suspense, tension, and fear for the characters. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' isn't any different as Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles, the casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael, showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.The person to really watch out for, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and later starring in Fincher's previous film 'The Social Network' (giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play, knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence, and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth, immediately bringing immense intimidation, danger, and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless, almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character, we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart, but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall, Mara gives a sensational, fearless, dedicated, and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.Being released during the cheery time of the holidays, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is not a feel-good film, by any means. It is a harsh, gritty, and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also, if you're squeamish, you will not like it. However, those who have read the book, and those who have not read it, should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel, I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a must!",10,307,457,22 December 2011
The Exorcist," The Exorcist: Still Terrifying 35 Years Later!
","Very rarely will a good horror film not depend on excessive special effects, have flawless performances, and a story that will hit you hard. So many horror movies are scary and fun, but 'The Exorcist' isn't fun. It's positively one of the most terrifying, disturbing, and upsetting horror movies of the modern era.Chris MacNeil is an actress. She lives in a very nice house in Washington with her adorable 12-year-old daughter Regan. All is well until Regan begins to display strange behavior. Soon, the behavior becomes creepy, and then it hits the point of being absolutely horrifying. Chris depends on faith and looks to Father Damien Karras for help. With the assistance of Father Merrin, the two come to a conclusion that the most demented force in the world is possessing Regan, and they must perform an exorcism in order to save her.'The Exorcist' is scary because it goes where no movie viewer has gone before. Stuff happened in the film that audiences had never seen, filling their minds with shock and disturbance. This is the most violent depiction of possession you will ever lay eyes on.We feel sympathy for Chris, but our heart goes out most of all to Regan. This poor girl has done nothing wrong, and this demonic force inside her is putting her through Hell and back. And the way Regan's face changes is absolutely nerve-shattering. She displays so many obscene things that we begin to think that Regan no longer exists.The movie is filmed in a very realistic way, almost like an actual documentary of an exorcism. It is done with hardly any special effects, despite the iconic 'vomit,' 'crucifix masturbation,' and 'head-turning' scene. Director William Friedkin depends on characters and imagination to scare you, and he achieves all goals required for the film.So much controversy revolves around 'The Exorcist.' Not only did it send religious people back to their church and cause many to try and sue Friedkin, but the movie, like 'The Omen,' has a so-called curse. Cast members Jack MacGowran and Lee J. Cobb died the year after the film, and reports of fire on the set shattered many. These are all just coincidences, and do not change anything about the film.The cast is absolutely perfect. The role of Chris is the role that Ellen Burstyn will be remembered most for, and Linda Blair deserves an Oscar for her disturbing portrayal of Regan. The exorcists are also great. Father Karras is played by Jason Miller with emotion. Karras is a priest who is losing his faith, and this exorcism challenges him extremely. And Max von Sydow is excellent as Father Merrin.'The Exorcist' is based on a best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty. Sure, the book was scary, but it's much more terrifying when something is seen on screen. This film remains a truly disturbing and eerie classic that always shocks me each time I watch it. It's essential for any fan of the genre. If you're a horror fan and you still haven't seen 'The Exorcist,' shame on you! 'What an excellent day for an exorcism!'",10,0,1,1 December 2009
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mia! Fun Factor Prevails Over Brain Cells
","I'm a sucker for movie musicals. 'Grease' got me started, and from then forth, I was hooked. There have been some great movie musicals(i.e. 'Rent,' 'Fiddler on the Roof,' and 'Chicago'), and there have been some bad ones('A Chorus Line,' 'Mame,' and 'The Wiz'). 'Mamma Mia' is a very popular show on Broadway, thanks to the classic ABBA soundtrack. So, it was inevitable that it would get the big screen treatment. So, how does the movie version work out? Sophie travels to her mother Donna's beautiful island to get married. The plans are set, and the invitations have been sent out. But Sophie's idea of a complete dream wedding is to have her father give her away, and she has never met her real father. Therefore, she invites three men to the wedding, one of them being her birth father. Donna has no clue that Sophie took such actions, and when she finds out, the plans for the wedding spiral out of control.Okay. I have no problem saying this. 'Mamma Mia' is certainly not the best movie musical. However, compared with the likes of 'A Chorus Line'(complete laziness) or 'The Wiz'(all style but no substance or acting talent), it's actually quite good.Growing up, my mom loved ABBA music, and still does. So it's safe to say that the die-hard ABBA fans have met their match with 'Mamma Mia' I have been rather neutral about ABBA, not all for them or against them. But in the end, I do enjoy some of their songs, and overall, the 'Mamma Mia' soundtrack is irresistible. No matter how they are sung in the film, they are extremely catchy.A really good movie musical is able to balance a good plot with its songs. Unfortunately, this film's storyline is a little weak. However, the reason 'Mamma Mia' works is not because of the story, but because of the nostalgia and shamelessness of the film. Director Phyllida Lloyd(who also directed the stage production) never apologizes for the film's energy, even if she isn't the best film director. 'Mamma Mia' is so cheesy, you can't help but smile.Now, it all comes down to the cast. 'Mamma Mia' has an unapologetically odd cast of characters. They don't have the greatest, most Broadway-style voices in the world(don't get me started on Pierce Brosnan), but who cares? It's a musical! The true star of the movie (although everyone gives it their all and does well) is Meryl Streep. Seeing her in 'Mamma Mia' surprised me. For all of the amazing performances in her career, she abandons the accent and sings. And man, she has a voice! With such highlights as 'Money, Money, Money' and 'The Winner Takes It All,' Streep is a showstopper. Of course, no one is getting Oscars for this, but their happiness and energy vibrate off of the screen and on to us. Their emotion is infectious, and therefore, the cast of 'Mamma Mia' is lovably weird.No thanks to the critics and the expectations of common movie-going perfectionists, the film has been taken too seriously and has been disliked by many, despite the major B.O. income. But the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. The point of some movie musicals is to just have fun. What you see is what you get. And this is where I say screw the critics! 'Mamma Mia' is like an enjoyable night at a karaoke bar. Leave your brain cells at the door, and enjoy yourself.",8,0,0,29 May 2011
Insidious," Insidious Is....
","There are two kinds of haunted house movies: the one that builds dread and never shows a ghost and the one that takes you on a roller-coaster ride. James Wan's latest horror outing, 'Insidious,' is a combination of both.Josh and Renai have moved into a new house with their sons, Foster and Dalton, and their baby girl, Cali. Renai is still getting over the nervousness of moving in, but overall, things are going quite well. Until Dalton falls into a sudden coma. That's when things go downhill. Strange voices vibrate off of Cali's baby monitor, loud noises erupt randomly, and Renai begins to see things. Almost certain that their house is haunted, Renai and her husband move into another house. But not even that can stop the terror. And when they invite a group of mediums/ghost hunters, they make the horrifying discovery that it's not the house that's haunted.Next to the important fact that it's from the creators of 'Saw' and Oren Peli, director of the ingenious fright-fest 'Paranormal Activity,' produced it, people will mostly recall the advertising campaign for 'Insidious.' A black screen constantly saying 'Insidious is...' One who has never seen the film can only ask that question. What is 'Insidious?' I can proudly answer that. It is easily one of the best and creepiest haunted house movies since 'The Others,' or maybe even 'Poltergeist.' But the film does feel like this generation's 'Poltergeist.' That was James Wan and Leigh Whannell's intention: to make a ghost story that is low-budget, atmospheric, and reminiscent of the classic 80's haunted house films.Despite maybe one happy moment between Josh and Renai and some comedy from the ghost hunters(played by screenwriter Leigh Whannell and Angus Simpson), there is nothing funny about this movie. Right from the opening credits, an immense feeling of eeriness and mood drips off of the film like common horror movie blood. Things start out creepy, and build to a terrific edge-of-seat fright that never flies off of the wheels.While the demented, torturous ghosts(or demons) are extremely scary, especially to look at, it's the more subtle, quiet things in the film that get to me most. There will be moments when something scary is happening, and you barely even notice it. Other times, a chair will rock or a door will slightly open, and a chill is brought down the spine.'Insidious' is filled to the brim with fantastic acting talent. Patrick Wilson('Watchmen' and 'Hard Candy') and Rose Byrne('Adam' and 'Bridesmaids') are perfect as Josh and Renai, especially Ms. Byrne. She may have been noticed in the horror sequel '28 Weeks Later,' but as fun as that movie is, I've always longed to see her make a seriously scary movie. She's done it here, and has proved herself worthy of more jobs in Hollywood in many different genres. Other times, Leigh Whannell, Angus Simpson, and horror mistress Lin Shaye(known best because her father, Robert Shaye, created New Line Cinema, and helped Wes Craven give birth to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street') nearly steal the show.And then there's the work of director James Wan. His two previous movies, 'Dead Silence'(a fun horror romp) and 'Death Sentence,' went by without much attention. But everybody knows Wan for 'Saw.' As creative and frightening as that film is, I was a little afraid that Wan would stay labeled as the creator of 'torture porn.' Luckily, he has broken that mold, and shown people that he can easily scare people with atmosphere more than a dude with a weapon. He also pays homage to directors like Tobe Hooper and David Lynch, as well as his first inspiration, Herk Harvey's 1962 film 'Carnival of Souls.' Thanks to this film, things have just gotten better for Wan and his partner, Mr. Whannell.While there are so many more remakes and harsh criticism, even for the more original films or sequels, you might realize that the horror genre is getting better. With movies like 'The Strangers,' 'Paranormal Activity,' 'The Last Exorcism,' 'The Descent,' and 'Black Swan'(yes, I call it a horror film), the future is bright for fright flicks. And 'Insidious' has just been added to the list. You'll scream, you'll gasp, you'll quiver with fear. This is a haunted house movie that nobody is going to forget.P.S. If you get freaked out by faces at your window, don't watch this movie.",10,0,2,13 August 2011
Evil Dead," What A Horror Remake Should Be and More
","I am a sucker for horror remakes. Don't get me wrong, some of them are downright bad (ahem, 'Psycho'). Others, like 'The Fly' and 'Let Me In,' prove worthy companions to the original and a little bit more. Hearing the news that Sam Raimi's 1981 classic 'The Evil Dead,' one of my all-time favorite horror movies, was getting a redux brought on some skepticism. Why touch 'Evil Dead?' It's a movie not built on plot or acting, but on the sheer passion of the director and crew behind it. Certainly, the need for a remake was unnecessary, but I am very welcoming when they come out, and I was more than impressed. 2013's 'Evil Dead' is the best horror remake since 'Let Me In.' The story of Raimi's flick was never very complicated, and it's pretty basic here: Four friends journey out to a cabin in the woods to help their friend Mia battle withdrawal after she quits heroine. There's her estranged brother, David, Natalie, his girlfriend, Olivia, a nurse, and Eric, a teacher. Of course, the cabin is equipped with a cellar filled with eerie things, one of them being a book wrapped in barbed wire, made out of human skin and inked in blood. Eric, of course, takes an interest to the book and recites an incantation. Bad move. The incantation brings out a vicious supernatural force that takes over Mia and proceeds to the others one by one. Cue the flying limbs! 'Evil Dead' is exactly the type of horror remake that works and then some. Uruguayan newcomer Fede Alvarez and his partner Rodo Sayagues have crafted a story that not only shows the deepest appreciation for the original, but also stands on its own two feet without depending too much on it. Alvarez and Sayagues are fans of the original themselves, and they know exactly what the audiences want to see. Their 'Evil Dead' pays tribute to the original and even works for those who never even knew there was an 'Evil Dead' in 1981.Every character is likable, if not a little underdeveloped. But none of the characters in the original film were three-dimensional either, and that's okay. Everyone here is lining up for a body count, but they still gain your sympathy before the Kondarian demons take them over. Shiloh Fernandez is good as David and Jessica Lucas is the same as Olivia. Elizabeth Blackmore's Natalie is the most underdeveloped character, but I still liked her. The movie's two standout performances are that of Jane Levy (TV's 'Suburgatory') as Mia and Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric. Both are put through serious hell as a demon and as a human being. Being buried alive and being stabbed in the eyes with hypodermic needles was certainly not on their bucket list. Levy and Pucci are real troopers, and their terrific work comes off in spades. But when it comes down to it all, the best performer is Levy. She is believable as a druggie and frightening enough as a Deadite. And boy, can she scream.Something's missing from this 'Evil Dead' and that's the gallows humor of the sequels. Personally, I prefer it that way. I was never a fan of 'Evil Dead 2.' It's overrated and abandons the scare factor of Raimi's predecessor. Dedicated fans tend to forget that Raimi wasn't making a horror comedy in 1981. He played the original straight, and the camp set in on its own. Still, it was a creepy and shocking film labeled as 'the ultimate experience in grueling terror.' Alvarez's movie is played with minimal laughs, and truly wants to get under your skin. When it's scary, it's very scary, with perfectly orchestrated jump scares. And when it is funny, it's not too funny. It's a perfect balance.But let's be real here. 'Evil Dead' was always best known for its graphic violence, and now, the violence is more graphic than ever. I've sat through the likes of some very gory movies, and the amount of goo this flick gets away with is shocking. It walks a truly thin line between an R-rating and the original film's NC-17 rating. 'Evil Dead' is swimming in blood, bathing in it like it was a giant pool in someone's backyard. There isn't a single moment that won't make you cringe, mostly because there's no CGI here. The effects of Roger Murray are all-natural practical effects, so when someone is stabbed or cut in half, you feel it. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the redband trailer, but Levy's character pulls some squirm-inducing action with a box cutter.In the end, Alvarez had a lot of pressure on his shoulders. This could have been a standard, by-the-numbers R-rated horror movie. But that doesn't fly here. It's not even discussed. Either be true to the original or don't make the movie at all. 2013's 'Evil Dead' is true to the original respectfully while being its own movie. Deadites will enjoy the winks at Raimi's film (tree rape, anyone?), and they will absolutely geek out over the gore. Plus, the finale is an utter blast. Those who have never seen the original will love it equally. When Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original's writer-director, producer, and star, give a remake their blessing, the filmmakers must be doing something right. Add to it the applause I heard at the end of the movie, then you know you have something special. 'Evil Dead' is a hit, not a miss!",10,7,51,7 April 2013
The Evil Dead," 'Join us!' 'The Evil Dead' is gruesome fun!
","Before 'Spider-Man,' Sam Raimi started off as the director of the classic fright film 'The Evil Dead,' which, to this day, is one of the hippest horror films ever.Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, and his friends Scott and Shelly head out to an isolated cabin in the woods for some fun. But right from the beginning, strange things happen. Cheryl hears voices howling 'Join us!' And then, Ash and Scott find a recording of a ritual from a book called The Book of the Dead. Too bad for them, because that ritual releases soul-hungry demons who possess everybody in the cabin. The only way to stop the demons is through the act of bodily dismemberment, and it's up to Ash to return the demons to their resting place. However, it's not gonna be easy.'The Evil Dead' can be very scary, but it's mostly great fun to watch due to its shameless amount of gore. This movie goes so over the top, it sort of becomes comic, and I dig that.Bruce Campbell has created such an icon out of Ash, a character who has lasted through 3 films. Campbell is a master. The other cast is very good with Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Hal Delrich as Scott, Betsy Baker as Linda and Sarah York as Shelly.'The Evil Dead' is a movie done with so much love for the genre, and a movie like that only comes once in a while. Hilariously gory, well-acted, and great fun to watch on a nice Halloween night, a horror movie like this doesn't get any better. A classic!****",10,18,26,20 August 2009
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity Is A Pure Horror Movie!
","'The Blair Witch Project' was a box-office hurricane due to its frightening, realistic vibe. And after movies that tried to imitate it, such as 'Cloverfield' and 'Quarantine,' we finally get a horror movie in the vein of the 1999 creepshow. 'Paranormal Activity' is a haunted house movie in the vein of 'Blair Witch.' This is the phenomenon that many people have demanded in their city. Brace yourself, because this movie is the most suspenseful, creepy, and absolutely terrifying ghost story since 'The Haunting.' Katie and her boyfriend Micah have just moved into a house in San Diego, California. Katie is all but well. For years, she has been haunted by something, and she's afraid that 'something' might still be with her, in their house, waiting for them. So, Micah, being the obnoxious skeptic he is, buys a video camera and sets it up in their upstairs bedroom so he can record any strange events while they sleep. What goes on is a lot more than strange. It's downright traumatizing.'Paranormal Activity' is the most effective horror movie in years, maybe even decades. Why? 1) Well, first off, it's so damned suspenseful. Director Oren Peli begins the film with a slowly building tension. Then the tension gets higher and higher, and, therefore, becomes unbearable to handle. Even the strongest horror movie buff might find it hard to sit through. Every time Katie and Micah go to sleep, you are paralyzed in fear, hoping that whatever's haunting them will leave them the hell alone.2) It messes with your mind. 'The Blair Witch Project' never showed the witch, but left it up to your imagination to figure out what was happening. Although that's a smart move, 'Paranormal Activity' shows all of the supernatural phenomena that it's supposed to. A lot of the times I was screaming at the screen, and hurling myself into the edge of my seat. Never, and I mean never, has that happened to me that often in a horror movie.3) It feels real. The movie begins and ends with no credits, almost like it's actual footage of real ghostly encounters. I believed in the movie, and so will you.4) Finally, the acting is perfect. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are so believable on the screen because they don't look like they're acting. This feels like an actual couple who really are experiencing weird stuff in their house. You felt for them.Overall, 'Paranormal Activity' might be better than 'The Blair Witch Project.' It's definitely one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen. Even if I did see it during the day, it still leaves a profound impact on you for a long time to come. It's amazing what you can do with just 11,000 dollars. What did Oren Peli do? He created a masterpiece. This is one movie that is not for the faint of heart, and not for people who just expect gore. This is for those who love psychological horror movies like 'The Haunting' and 'The Others.' You won't be able to sleep for days. And most of all, you must never see it alone. This is the one we've been waiting for.P.S. What a terrifying ending.",10,1,5,24 October 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Getting Dragged To Hell Was Never This Much Fun!
","Known to many for making the block-buster 'Spiderman' series, Sam Raimi began in his career in 1981 with a wonderful little gem called 'The Evil Dead.' The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw 'The Evil Dead,' I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's 'Drag Me To Hell' is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the 'Spiderman' franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe 'Drag Me To Hell' and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE! Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late? Despite its PG-13 rating, 'Drag Me To Hell' is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out!There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary.The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman! Justin Long has starred in another very popular horror movie called 'Jeepers Creepers.' He is also very good here as Christine's boyfriend Clay, the dude who is always telling her that everything is okay and nothing is coming for her. Hah! Welcome back to horror, Mr. Long. David Paymer is very funny as Christine's boss. Dileep Rao makes a very good psychic as Rham Jas. And Lorna Raver shines as Ganush. Raimi has created the most disgusting gypsy ever.Sam Raimi directs 'Drag Me To Hell' with such energy and love for the genre. This is the guy who obviously always loved horror movies. He never holds back on scares and gross-outs. And the effects here are remarkable. Thank God Raimi has returned to horror.Peter Travers has called 'Drag Me To Hell' 'horror movie heaven,' which it very well is. You'll completely forget that it's rated PG-13 and you'll have a fantastic time jumping in your seat, screaming, and laughing. 'Drag Me To Hell' stands as one of 2009's best horror movies in line with 'My Bloody Valentine 3D,' 'The Last House on the Left' and 'Friday the 13th.' Now, let's see what 'Sorority Row' and 'Jennifer's Body' can do.",10,9,18,3 October 2009
Sinister," Something Truly Sinister
","If you can find new ways to expand on familiar formulas, you just might have a good horror movie. 'Sinister' isn't a good horror movie. It's a GREAT one. Directed by Scott Derrickson (director of 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose'), this shiver-inducing fright fest is the perfect genre flick for the Halloween season or any time of year.Ellison Oswalt is a struggling writer, barely living off of money he made from a book that was successful at least 10 years ago. In order to make his comeback and pen down a thrilling new piece of non-fiction, he moves his wife, Tracy, and children, Ashley and Trevor, into a new house. The family isn't exactly fond of this choice, but they're warming up to it. 'I'm going to write the best book anyone's ever read,' Ellison tells Ashley. They don't know, however, that they have just moved into a crime scene. Several years ago, a family was hung from a tree in this house's backyard, and the daughter is yet to be found. The most disturbing notion, for Ellison, is that while in the writing process, he discovers and watches this and other gruesome acts on Super 8 videotapes he found in the attic. But there is an unsettling string attached to these murders, and it's lurking in the background of the screen.Sure, 'Sinister' follows the formula of other horror films, but it doesn't dumb things down for the audience. Once we find out terrible things happened in this setting, a lot of the fear we expect is in the imagination, with creaking floorboards, slamming doors, and eerie whispering. Therefore, it is a brilliantly scary horror film. I haven't been this terrified since 'Insidious.' And surprise, surprise. 'Sinister' is produced by Jason Blum, producer of 'Paranormal Activity' and 'Insidious.' Owing a lot to 'The Shining,' 'The Amityville Horror,' and 'The Ring,' newcomer C. Robert Cargill and director Derrickson have written a smart script with a truly nightmarish villain: not just the film's monster, but film itself. The Super 8 tapes presented to us are some of the most disturbing pieces of footage I have ever seen, and they definitely give a feeling of discomfort to the viewer. If a horror movie can make you feel appropriately uncomfortable, then it's done its job.The cast is actually small, and it is led by A-list performer Ethan Hawke as Ellison. Hawke has given his best performance in years. At first, Ellison seems like a selfish jerk. He's not exactly the perfect father figure for Ashley and Trevor, and it's a miracle that Tracy has endured this much with him. But after he finds the Super 8s, he's not in this to make a book out of blood money. He's concerned and dying to put together the pieces of the puzzle before anyone else is endangered. Hawke portrays that flawlessly, and it's pretty obvious that he wouldn't have chosen to be a part of this movie if it wasn't good.Newcomer Juliet Rylance is also very good as Tracy, her best moment being when she finally confronts Ellison about his actions. She is believable and always sympathetic. James Ransone also stars as a town deputy, providing some great humor to help the audience breathe before the big 'BOO!' And Vincent D'Onofrio goes uncredited as a professor who provides Ellison with a hefty amount of information about the events behind these home movies.The jump scares of 'Sinister' are perfectly executed, and there are no cats waiting to falsely freak you out. All of the horror in this film is real and genuine. From the beginning, 'Sinister' is dark in terms of atmosphere and tone, and the ending, unlike the opinions of the critics, gave me chills. Why 'Paranormal Activity 4' would make more money than this film is understandable, but that doesn't make that sequel a good movie. This is the rare film that incorporates found footage into a realistic, non-home video setting and it manages to scare you out of your wits. You want something frightening? 'Sinister' is the best horror movie of 2012. Not for the faint of heart, but it will suit the needs of the more intelligent horror movie buffs.",10,10,13,10 November 2012
Halloween," Halloween: Carpenter's Classic Chiller
","Michael Myers has become a bigger icon than Ronald McDonald. He has carved his way through eight sequels, a remake, and a remake of a sequel, and he is the first major horror movie villain to inspire other classics to follow in his wake('Friday the 13th' and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'). But to really know who Michael Myers is, to understand why he frightens us, you have to go back to 1978, when John Carpenter released a low-budget independent horror film that not only gave birth to an icon, but stood the test of time after more than 30 years as one of the scariest movies of all time. That movie is 'Halloween.'The story is extremely simple: In 1963, a six year old boy murders his sister, Judith Myers, in cold blood with a kitchen knife. After 15 years of confinement to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, the killer escapes and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, with Dr. Sam Loomis(played magnificently by Donald Pleasence) in desperate pursuit. Enter Laurie Strode(played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends Annie and Lynda. It is October 31st, and Laurie and Annie are babysitting in houses right across from each other while ditsy Lynda messes around with her boyfriend Bob. What they don't know is the killer has targeted them and has some pretty gruesome plans for this Halloween night.Such a bare-bones plot could have resulted in an average exploitation film a la 'The Hills Have Eyes' or 'Black Christmas.' But, obviously, John Carpenter and Debra Hill had other, more serious intentions when they wrote their script and filmed the movie. With a tiny budget of just $300,000, they were out to make a horror film that would transcend the way we looked at the genre. And it did. 'Halloween' still terrifies, with its mind-numbing suspense, its creepy villain, a fantastic cast, and a nightmarish musical score.When it comes to supernatural forces, John Carpenter knows the way to any movie buff's fear factor, after such films as 'The Fog' and 'Christine.' 'Halloween' was Carpenter's first major film, and he knew exactly what he was doing when he created the character of Michael Myers, or let's just say 'The Shape.' The character may be a human being (isn't it always more scary when a killer is human?), but he is not seen that way by his creator or the audience. Michael is frightening because he almost gets a kick out of killing his victims. He plays psychological games with them until the time comes for them to die. Michael is treated as a furiously violent force of nature, a predator that can be anywhere at anytime, ready to strike. His strength is overwhelming, his lack of emotion is shocking, and his inability to die makes him all the more spine-tingling. That is why he is called 'The Shape' in the first film.We never need to see Michael's face, and we barely do. Everything that we're afraid of can be projected on his choice of visage. The mask that he wears(originally a Captain Kirk mask that was spray-painted white, with the hair teased and eye-holes widened) is disturbingly expressionless, allowing the viewer to project anything they want on it.As suspenseful as the movie is, the score(composed by Carpenter himself) is almost just as effective. The recurring musical themes symbolize evil, the feeling that something horrible is approaching us from a dark corner or at our front door. No shrieking violins are found here, but Carpenter's simplistic music makes the movie more chilling.Later over-analyzed in the 'Final Destination' movies, 'Halloween' subtly hints at the subject of fate. The film has something to say. It tells us that fate is inescapable, that no matter what, some form of evil or death will come for you, whether it's watching you from outside, or crossing the street, or staring at you from a backyard.Dean Cundey's cinematography is something worth noting. The film takes place almost entirely at night, making the streets of Haddonfield and the Doyle and Wallace houses a little abnormally dark. This allows for our villain to creep into the shadows and watch from places you can't see him.The cast is pure gold. Back in 1978, the choice to cast an important cinematic performer in a horror film kind of brought some skepticism. Donald Pleasence was an exception. He could have portrayed Sam Loomis(the name of Janet Leigh's boyfriend in 'Psycho') in a cheesy way with over-acted dialog. But Pleasence wouldn't allow it. He plays Loomis with great intensity, the fear that Michael will kill again evident in his eyes. Annie and Lynda are played by Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles(famous for Brian De Palma's 'Carrie'). Both are played very realistically and sympathetically, especially by Soles. She is funny and a joy to watch. Her death is disquieting because of that.And then there's Laurie Strode. 'Halloween' marked the debut of Jamie Lee Curtis, and for an actress that doesn't exactly love the horror genre, she makes for a flawless heroine. Thanks to Curtis, Laurie is human and likable. We don't want to see her die. We want to see her triumph and fight back. She is our protector. This role was meant for Curtis from the beginning, and being 'Psycho' star Janet Leigh's daughter, she knows how to scream!Overall, what hasn't been said about 'Halloween' that hasn't been said by everyone else? The movie is a horror masterpiece, a classic that no slasher follow-up, not even the wonderfully entertaining 'Friday the 13th,' can possibly beat. Not including part 3, this movie franchise is a ball for all genre enthusiasts, even Rob Zombie's films. Like Michael Myers, 'Halloween' will never die. After more than 30 years, I think it's safe to say, I quote the character of Tommy Doyle, that 'you can't kill the boogeyman.'",10,1,2,1 November 2011
Carrie," Carrie: Classic King
","On paper, 'Carrie' was, and still is, one of Stephen King's greatest literary creations, one that almost didn't happen. It is a moving but disturbing horror-drama, unique and frightening in every way. Since film adaptations of King's novels are mostly hit or miss, this story had to be made correctly and with enough class and scares to mark a memorable place in the film-goer's mind. Unsurprisingly, Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of 'Carrie' is brilliant.Working from a script by Lawrence D. Cohen, the film brings us the story of Carrie White, a mousy, quiet high school misfit who suffers at the hateful hands of her peers and takes tremendous physical and emotional blows from her overly religious psycho of a mother. Only one adult, gym teacher Miss Collins, truly looks out for her. After a terrible experience in the girl's locker room, classmate Sue Snell takes it upon herself to fix things for Carrie by persuading her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts, and at first, prom night is an exciting and engaging experience, until someone pulls another joke, a prank that goes way too far. Then people begin to laugh. That's when Carrie takes her revenge. The school doesn't know that Carrie has a secret power, and tonight, she's going to use it to her full advantage.De Palma's 'Carrie' is a respectful adaptation of the book, one that hews closely while making some appropriate changes. There are two ways to view this film: as a drama and as a horror movie.From the dramatic standpoint, 'Carrie' hits all the right buttons as the viewer is subjected to what could be the worst case of school bullying ever committed to celluloid. The torture Chris Hargensen and her fellow females inflict upon our poor title character is overwhelming and shocking, especially in the opening shower scene, which is iconic for its heavy amount of nudity. You feel sympathy for Carrie, which is intimidating because of the transformation she undergoes in the third act. She is an ugly duckling, the shy little fish in a big pond.The behavior of Margaret White, Carrie's mother, is arguably as cruel as that of the teenagers at Bates High School. A nightmare of a woman who dedicates her time to tea and the constant reading of the bible, Mama's own sins have convinced her that since her daughter is now a woman (Carrie has her first period at the beginning of the movie), she is equally but unjustifiably guilty.On the flip side of the coin, there's the horror aspect, and boy, is that important. 'Carrie' is a perfect scare show. When it's scary, it's very scary. When it's gory (and it has to be), it is very gory. Certain times, the film is also surreal and hallucinatory. When Carrie gets doused in pig's blood at the prom, are her peers really laughing or is it all in her head? We don't know, but from the look in Carrie's eyes, we tell right away that she is angry. The prom scene is a disturbing, epic sequence where a moment of bliss turns into utter chaos. It's an excellent turning point for the movie.The cast, filled with young talent, is led by the unforgettable performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie as Carrie and Margaret White. Spacek, at the time, was almost 30 years old, but still looked young enough to play a teenager. She was almost not given the part, but her determination and personal makeover earned her the role. She is pitch perfect as Carrie; she puts in the perfect amount of sympathy before taking a hard left turn. It is a wondrous and gut-punching performance that got Spacek a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The same is equally said for Laurie, who viewed Margaret as a satirical look at religious stereotypes. Her performance recalls the portrayal Jack Nicholson put in for Kubrick's 'The Shining,' another Stephen King adaptation. One can't tell if she's being over the top or if her method acting is making her disappear into the character. She scares us probably more than anything that could be prevalent in Carrie's personality. Her monologue at the end of the film is absolutely chilling.Brian De Palma's direction is spot-on and creative. Split-screens are employed with some of the most horrific imagery, and his other sequences are almost dream-like.The movie is finally helped by Pino Donaggio's unsettling score, which, in this viewer's opinion, is one of the best musical orchestrations in horror movie history. It is, at some times, sweet and lullaby-like, but other times screeching (echoing 'Psycho') and dread-filled. There's really no other score like this one.Overall, 'Carrie' is a classic horror film through and through. Its religious and pubescent metaphors make the viewer cringe, the casting is unbelievable, the scares are palpable, and it does all of this well while sticking closely to its source. There's no movie like it, and after 36 years, it shows no sign of aging. It will have you seeing red in the best of ways. King fans, be not afraid. 'Carrie' is completely worth its status! P.S. The ending still makes you jump!",10,1,1,16 October 2012
The Woman in Black," A Dark, Wildly Atmospheric Exercise In Supernatural Horror!
","Since the publication of Susan Hill's 1983 novel, 'The Woman in Black' has endured great success in London as an underrated TV movie of the 80's and a rather popular theatrical adaptation. Seems to me that it was in dire need of attention in America. Director James Watkins, screenwriter Jane Goldman, and the newly resurrected horror studio Hammer have brought it back by giving it the remake treatment, and for the first time in a while, a horror remake is as solid as its inspiration.Just coming off of the tragedy of losing his wife in childbirth, Arthur Kipps is sent to an ordinary and lifeless town to settle the will and other documents belonging to the dead Alice Drablow, who owned the supposedly haunted Eel Marsh house. While he makes a friend in a man named Daily, the residents of the town treat Arthur as a disease and strongly encourage him to stay away from Eel Marsh. But Arthur is not a superstitious man, and spends several nights in the house. Then things take a turn for the worse. Creaking floorboards, imaginary footsteps, and large shadows plague Arthur while he is on his mission. Worst of all, a female figure in a black dress makes her presence known, and it's quite clear that she is a restless and angry spirit.As gruesome as director Watkins' first film 'Eden Lake' was, the stark realism of his antagonists' gory actions set up a tremendous sense of reality for the audience. 'The Woman in Black' takes a different route. Watkins understands that as fictional as a ghost story may be, such a film requires minimal blood and intense tension and paranoia. We see the title specter very rarely, or even from a distance to bring up Arthur's supposedly blurred imagination. Is she real? Could the house really be haunted. Well, such a phantasm is questionable to the main character's sanity.But tension abounds in 'The Woman in Black' right when Arthur steps foot into Eel Marsh House. You can tell right away that the place is destined to be haunted. The inside is raggedy and aged, and the creepy dolls in one of the rooms are still eerily playing. Once a noise occurs, Arthur and the audience go quietly ballistic. As an entry into mainstream horror fare, the film does have its share of 'BOO!' scares, but here, it's all about suspense and waiting for the fear to creep up on you.Most movie buffs will check this movie out for the casting of Daniel Radcliffe as Kipps. Fresh off the conclusion of the 'Harry Potter' series, Radcliffe has a lot of weight on his shoulders. Most of the movie depends on him and his reactions to the supernatural events going on around him. He still looks a little young to be married with a child, but Radcliffe handles himself surprisingly well. Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer back up the main character greatly as Daily and his unstable wife.Perhaps the movie could have been better if Jane Goldman included some humor in her dead serious script, but 'The Woman in Black' sticks to the old-fashioned formulas of such films as 'The Haunting,' 'The Innocents,' and 'The Others.' Throw in a few creepy children and some great effects, and you have a recipe for a solid haunted house movie. Thanks to a heavy atmosphere and a good performance from the Harry Potter alumni, 'The Woman in Black' achieves its goals and brings some great chills to the spine.",9,0,1,7 June 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A masterpiece of modern horror! Still the best in the series!
","After such gruesome drive-in flicks as 'The Last House on the Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes,' master of horror Wes Craven wanted to make a movie that would bring the slasher genre back to life, since the genre was clouded by untalented, unoriginal films that shouldn't have been made. So, along came 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' To this day, Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood: Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure, they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found, but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep, they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?'A Nightmare on Elm Street' created a terrifying villain, a plot that is very original, and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is, just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is, or Jason Voorhees, or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit, which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance, Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy 'Fast Times At Ridgemont High.' Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death, not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it, and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen. His death is second best.Nancy's parents, Donald and Marge Thompson, are played by John Saxon of 'Black Christmas' and Ronee Blakely of 'Nashville.' They are the last of the parents on Elm Street to hold a very dark secret about Freddy, something that they aren't telling Nancy or the others. Not such a good idea, since Freddy never seems to leave them alone.I can't imagine anybody else playing Freddy other than Robert Englund. Englund is flawless in the role that made him a star. This is where Englund is scariest as Freddy. In the sequels, Freddy becomes a comedian with rather stale wisecracks. What makes Freddy so scary in the first 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movie is how his dark, macabre sense of humor comes off as frightening. And he's always there, wherever you are. 'Since he's a dream figure, he can basically do anything,' says critic Aviva Briefel. 'He can transform into anything. That's what makes him so scary. How can you resist sleep? He's everywhere.' If horror movies got nominations, Englund would be first in line to win the award.Craven's direction is perfect. He films 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' with a great amount of flair and he provides plenty of gore that will satisfy gore-hounds and enough scares to make you jump.The verdict: 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' still holds up as one of the scariest horror movies ever made. And people are always going to remember it. When kids are off to summer camp or they want their parents to tell them a scary story before bed, they most likely will hear about Freddy Krueger and his razor-blade glove. Nightmares are guaranteed. 'One, two, Freddy's coming for you...Three, four, better lock your door...Five, six grab your crucifix...Seven, eight, gonna stay up late...Nine, ten, never sleep again!'",10,14,16,28 September 2009
Footloose," Footloose: A So-So Remake
","Of course, when you talk about remakes, you instantly make comparisons to the original. The original 1984 film 'Footloose' had a ridiculous plot and cheesy acting, but with some neat choreography and classic music, that contributed to its charm. Was a remake of 'Footloose' necessary? I don't think so. I approached this one expecting the worst. Fortunately, the movie wasn't awful. In fact, at moments, it's quite good.Boston resident Ren McCormack moves to the small town of Bomont, where everything to the adults is religion and dancing isn't allowed. After a tragedy that occurred ten years ago, the town decided that any dancing or teenage activity is just wrong. Many teenagers are still breaking the rules, including Reverend Shaw Moore's daughter Ariel. Soon enough, Ren leads the pack in fighting to abolish the no-dancing law.This remake is almost a scene-for-scene, line-for-line adaptation (the original film's writer Dean Pitchford co-wrote the script), so that certainly sets the film slightly on the wrong track.But it should really come down to how the actors portray their characters, and there are some highlights of disappointment. Newcomer Kenny Wormald as Ren has his benefits, being a professional dancer. He sports some good choreography, especially in what I like to call 'the angry dance' scene. However, some elements of believability are missing. At times, I didn't believe Ren's rebellious nature, unlike with Kevin Bacon's portrayal in 1984. Wormald seems afraid of his actions, which probably won't sit well with fans of the original. As for Ariel, Julianne Hough falls into Wormald's category. She is also a professional dancer, and her solo work during the film is energetic and entertaining. Her acting chops are decent, surprisingly. But the fact that she is almost 30 years old hurts her performance and makes us think her age doesn't fit the role. Dennis Quaid is still hamming it up in his movies, but actually holds back here as Ariel's father. There are some nice moments of father-daughter confrontation and Quaid's care for his family is a nice icing on the cake. Andie MacDowell's screen time as Vi Moore, Shaw's wife, is minimal. She almost disappears into the set.The best actor here is Miles Teller as Ren's buddy Willard. Teller is funny and likable, and the sequence where he finally learns to dance is nifty and enjoyable.And then there's the soundtrack, one of the film's biggest challenges. The original's music is a stand-out and still has people dancing to it. Over four songs from the original have been covered, and since director Craig Brewer (known for 'Black Snake Moan' and 'Hustle and Flow') has Southern roots in him, the soundtrack has a lot of country twang to it, but settles for a few hip-hop moments. One cover of 'Holding Out For A Hero' is quirky and interesting. Blake Shelton's shot at the Kenny Loggins title classic is not bad. But then there are moments when the music falls flat. Jana Kramer's rendition of 'Let's Hear It For The Boy' is missing the stylish 80's funk of the original. And last, we have the classic love theme 'Almost Paradise,' originally performed by Mike Reno and Ann Wilson. Victoria Justice and Hunter Hayes try their hand at this emotional classic, and the emotion feels stripped away. What was once a wonderful and vibrant ballad has turned into a Disney track.Overall, the movie does have its strong points. The choreography is fantastic, and the acting sure isn't terrible. But the story of 'Footloose' is dated by now and remains a fine display of an 80's guilty pleasure. This is just a carbon copy of the original that lacks some of its pizazz. The 1984 movie was cheesy to a hilt, and we love it for that. So why does the remake sometimes take itself too seriously? Pre-teens might find this one a blast. Die-hard fans of the original will be split right down the middle. But since I am a fan, Craig Brewer's 'Footloose' could have been much worse.",5,0,3,14 March 2012
