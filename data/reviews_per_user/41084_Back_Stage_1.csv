The Ring," don't see it alone
","I have to say that this film utterly frightened me. I saw it with a friend and she had to stay over at my house because we were both so afraid to be alone. The thing that made this movie the scariest was the twists. Not your average 'Sixth Sense' kinda twists, buttwists you would never have imagined. When you think you've finally figured it out, they go and reveal something that makes you go 'okay...maybe not...' The finally twist is one to make you gasp out loud. And the worst part of the movie (which I won't ruin) is a scene that will haunt you for days. This movie, although is may start out a bit slow and familiar, is peppered with scares and thrills that feel fresh and new. i would reccomend this movie if you aren't easily scared because trust me it will scare you. And the wicked twist of an ending is enough to make up for the fact that you had to pay 8 bucks to get in.8/10",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
