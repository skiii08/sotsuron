Casablanca," The best movie... EVER!
","Roger Ebert said this about 'Citizen Kane,' 'If I were ever stranded on a desert island and could only watch one movie 'Citizen Kane' would be the one.' I feel the same way about 'Casablanca.' I think it has a much better story line than 'Citizen Kane' and it didn't need inovative camera shots to make it a truely unique movie experience. And, it has some of the best dialoge ever written in a movie. Ex. Strasser: Why did you come to Casablanca? Rick:      I came for the waters. Strasser: This is the desert! Rick:      I was misinformed.Score one for Rick!They don't write them like that any more!",10,3,3,12 July 2003
