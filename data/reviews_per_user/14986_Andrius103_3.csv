Requiem for a Dream," Depending on the point of view it might be very close to perfection
","There are lots of movies with twisted plots, surreal scenarios and stuff like that, which makes you think - think about movie, story, main idea, life, philosophy. This one struck me, though I was aware of everything - you can't startle a person if he knows what's coming, do you? Well this movie does. And there might be a point for you also, or maybe not, and this point might happen anywhere, when you understand: it's not the movie that's messed up, it's us - people I'm not trying to compare or what, but for me Requiem for a Dream shows that Aronofsky as a director just might have the edge over Nolan (no matter how much I love Mr. Christopher's movies)",10,2,4,13 January 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," No fancy review title here, just watch it - it's good for your health
","I'm not going to hide, that it's my favorite one, nor I will brag about it. I like to think, that most movies can be compared by how they succeed on different levels, which for me are: story, characters, sounds, picture, acting, philosophy, psychological impact. I'm still not sure if they all are equal, and anyway Space Odyssey succeeds in most of them, but if we consider the later two levels to be slightly more important, Space Odyssey becomes an ultimate movie. It might not be a movie at all actually, Space Odyssey is more likely a message (an important one) to humanity. It's also a half-encrypted one, which allows you to create a meaning, while still guiding you somewhere. Maybe that's why everyone after watching it has a slightly different interpretation, but main questions and ideas that arise in our minds are the same.We are all humans after all, and we are all here, spinning at a very fast speed on this funny round thing we call Earth and which has been our home for a very very long time. There might be a lot people, who after watching Space Odyssey, say it was boring and they just wasted their 'precious' time, but you can be sure - message was delivered. Kubrick was a genius, but so are we all",10,0,3,13 January 2011
Trainspotting," Some just like watching, and some ride it
","This is my first review, before it I used IMDb only for voting (not that anyone would care, votes were for me to plainly compare movies) and movie list.Now Trainspotting here deserves some words. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie from begging to the end, maybe not my type of movie, I don't know. But there's something strange about the name this movie has. I didn't read the novel, but I do know in which context trainspotting was mentioned, and words at he end of movie gives a big allusion to main idea (yeah, I like to act like captain obvious): regular life, having TV, family is just like trainspotting - nothing fancy, but OK if you actually do enjoy it. And the life these guys live is nothing like spotting, it's more like riding train at full speed. Not that it's a better way to get to the destination(if such exist), but it's different, it's hardcore, and this ride most likely end with a fast death. If it's your choice, then go, ride it, but don't kill and upset innocent passengers.Bottom line: I wouldn't call movie a masterpiece, and it's not your regular drama/action movie, but very well watchable and recommendable",7,2,3,13 January 2011
