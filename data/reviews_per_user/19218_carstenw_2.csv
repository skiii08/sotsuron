Requiem for a Dream," Stunning but sad
","We all know it happens, we all know it is out there. We have all seen other movies which deal with drug addiction, and they were sad. This movie leaps over them all and just force-feeds you with details which you never wanted to see. It is incredibly good, a stunning achievement, and only a slight feeling of over-the-top-ness stops me from giving it a 10/10. However, it is incredibly sad. I feel shocked, and my stomach is churning. I didn't really want to know all this. I think I may never watch it again.However, I would recommend to everyone to watch it at least once. It really deserves it.",9,1,2,7 February 2007
Coffee and Cigarettes," Awkward
","Now, I am a big Jarmusch fan, owning many of his movies, with the aspiration to own them all, and I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time, having seen the trailer, and being a big fan of many of the actors and artists in it.However, I have to admit that I am disappointed, and not just a little disappointed. I felt myself getting impatient with it, getting a little annoyed even, although that did go away. The whole movie was just... awkward. The 'coffee and cigarettes' of the title, well... the only thing they seem to have added to this movie is to prolong the very long awkward moments in the movie. If there had been no cigarettes, no coffee, then the movie would have been mercifully shorter.There were a few good moments, a few chuckles, and perhaps even a good laugh or two, and a nice moment, but really, I could only recommend this movie to hard-core Jarmusch fans, if at all. It has the feel of second-rate actors having learned their lines, and only barely, in perhaps 10 minutes between more important things. The actors and the artists in this movie are not second-rate by any stretch of the imagination, so it really is a disservice to them.I only hope that I will one day watch it again, and find redemption in either my opinion of this movie, or in my general opinion of Jarmusch.",6,0,1,6 February 2007
