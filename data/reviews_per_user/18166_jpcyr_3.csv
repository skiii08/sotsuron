Ford v Ferrari," Totally hooked
","You know you are totally hooked to this movie when you are planning watching it in your bed, and you end up watching it all the way seated in it, rivated to the screen, unable to move, deeply absorbed.What an exhilarating ride that was. And what, again, an amazing performance by Christian Bale. Certainly one the greatest actor of our time.",9,2,3,31 January 2020
Aquaman," No story at all.
","It's sad to see movie spending so much money on actors, fx and all and not on a good story. I was not even able to finish the movie as boring it is.",4,0,1,12 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Outstanding from all its verses
","I can't ever bare my mind around the fact it's coming from Sony Pictures Animation. They did something incredible here. Remember when Pixar came up with Toy Story. Then this is it. This is the new frontier into animated movies.Everything was great about this movie, voices, sound design, sound fx, musics, editing, 3D animations blended with 2D, super-realistic combined with semi-realistic and even cartoonish, storytelling, dialogue, absolutely everything.There is not a moral and something to remember so much as in the Pixar movies, but it was certainly an incredible entertainment from start to finish.",8,1,2,28 February 2019
