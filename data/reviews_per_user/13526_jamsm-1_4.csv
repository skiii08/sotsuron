The Avengers," Not That Bad
","I enjoyed the movie. Not sure I understand all the platitudes it's getting here. I guess some people are just a bit over stimulated.The movie could've done with a 20 minute cut towards the end to avoid going into 'Micheal Bay' territory. Maybe this time could have been used to further develop the characters and how they relate to each other.The plot was also pretty weak, sometimes it was hard to figure out whether it was Transformers 2 or The Avengers, such was the similarity of pretty much everything at the end (including the aliens and CGI).A solid 6/10.",6,10,21,12 May 2012
Sucker Punch," Palimpsestic
","Deceiving, deviant, fragmented, layered then collated. Reminiscent of an echo.Sucker Punch is a film that's more than a sum of its parts. It'll be appreciated long after most of the present commentators and creators are gone.Something that comes close to capturing the early 21st century video game otaku occidental cum oriental online sub-culture. It represents an era when borders only existed in a physical sense.A great film, intentionally or not...............................................",9,9,19,1 April 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Losers in space.
","Although this film has been expected in the comic/sci-fi community for a while it has kind of snuck up on the rest of us - so I went into this with only a vague notion of what to expect - mostly based on the previous Marvel offerings, Avengers, Thor etc.While this film certainly contains elements of the previous Marvel films, i.e the propensity for Bayesque bombastic CGI, pummelling your senses into submission with no real purpose or reason this film sets itself apart from the typical blockbuster fare with its well rendered sci-fi environments, characters and concepts.Although this film is ostensibly 2010's The Losers in space (complete with 70's rock/Motown soundtrack and Zoe Saldana â€“ not complaining!), it offers a lot more than the superhero movies that went before, and stands on its own as a great sci-fi film.",10,1,5,3 August 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Pearl Harbour: Revenge of the Fallen
","Oh yes my friends. Never has a movie been soo long, had soo many special effects, been soo expensive, been soo hammy and been soo utterly utterly rubbish. Not since Pearl Harbour.If this film had been 70,80,90 minutes, maybe I could see the fun side of having robots shoot at other robots, as well as Megan Fox's anatomy in gratuitous slow motion without any discernible hint of a plot or acting talent. But oh no. This weighs in at over 2 hours. I was literally in slack jawed amazement it was still going on 120 minutes in.This movie was definitely aimed at the under 12s. If you enjoyed this movie you probably fell asleep till 10 minutes before the end, or have been recently lobotomised.",1,15,33,22 June 2009
