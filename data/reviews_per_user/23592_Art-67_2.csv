Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two more shots...
","George Lucas was once quoted as saying that he got about 50% of the desired effects that he wanted out of Star Wars:  A New Hope.  He recently said that he was 90% satisfied with his most recent creation: The Phantom Menace.Personally, I prefer the 50% effect.  This latest installment is egregiously overpowered with CGI razzle-dazzle.  Menace is entertaining but unfortunately totally devoid of substance.  It is a distant and distorted echo of the original trilogy.  The only redeeming features of the film are the blazing 400 mph podrace scene and the frenetic light saber duel at the end.  Apart from that, I was basically cringing at the crass antics of Jar Jar Binks.  In particular, the two scenes involving defecation and flatulence totally robbed this film of its dignity.  I thought such puerile behavior was reserved for Austin Powers, not Star Wars!  In any case, Jar Jar Binks is an absolute abomination to the Star Wars universe (or any universe, for that matter).  Sadly, I hear he will appear in Ep. II and disgrace that film as well.  Finally, I was appalled at the general lack of development of all the key characters.  Actors of the caliber of Neeson, Jackson, McGregor and Portman deserve better than this.Lucas has two more rounds at this Star Wars stuff.  I prefer to view things optimistically, and I am confident that he will rise to the occasion.  He certainly can do no worse...",Null,0,0,16 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Sensational
","Whereas the fourth and sixth episodes suffer from some minor blemishes (the first installment has too many to mention), Episode V is sacrosanct.The wisdom of Yoda is timeless: 'Do or do not...there is no try.'  The classic light saber duel culminates into one of the most startling revelations in cinematic history: 'No, Luke...I am your father.'  It sends chills down my spine every time I see it.Possibly the greatest sequence ever filmed is the tragic freeze of Capt. Solo.  The editing involved in this scene is phenomenal...everything is synchronized perfectly, including the dialogue, the action, the eerie lighting, and of course...the ominous 'Imperial March' theme.  It is unparalleled.",Null,0,0,15 July 1999
