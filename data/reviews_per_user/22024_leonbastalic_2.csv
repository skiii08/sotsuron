Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," 'JACK! The ship is gone.' 'No' again?!'
","Well yes the ship is gone, Barbosssa lost the Pearl and his leg on it. Thanks to Blackbeard (aka, Edward Teach). I really enjoyed this film and I really don't care for any of bad critics I have read. I am a true POTC fan and believe me go and see this movie. It is different but it is GREAT! It's just a bit smaller than the first three and it has an excellent beginning. Johnny and Cruz were just perfect for each other, but in the end he takes her to the 'Godforsaken island' where he was. You should really watch this movie in 3D, I saw it in REAL3D but not in IMAX, you should really go and see it 2D, It's really good but it's nothing special to see it in 3D. If you aren't a POTC fan than you will enjoy the movie even more.A pair of fishermen on their boat of the coast of Spain pull an old man out of the ocean who became entangled in their fishing net. He gasps 'Ponce de Leon' and the men quickly sail to shore and bring him to the Spanish monarch. The young monarch learns of the Fountain of Youth and demands that his men set sail at once to find the ship.",10,3,6,19 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," EPIC, perfect ending for the story of a century!
","This film was just amazing, epic, dramatic, dark, happy and really the best of all Hp films! I'm one of the greatest fans of Harry Potter there are and I was stunned by the epicness of the Hallows part 2! The movie begins with Voldemort stealing the Elder wand, but it's shorter than the original.. then it takes us to WB logo and then to Hogwarts... Soon, we're at Shell Cottage getting ready to visit Gringotts. It's a bit short but epic and full of action (the Gringotts). A perfect start for an EPIC! Everything is going on pretty fast from that spot! I usually don't like violence and gore, but there is some... Voldemort appears to be walking with feet covered in blood in Malfoy Manor. There are some really light and joyful moments in Hogwarts... Until Voldemort comes by. There are some epic scene including McGonagall looking really sad and cheerful at the same time. So there are still some horcruxes to find. The Cup of Hufflepuff will be destroyed by a basilisk fang and then there is a kiss we'we all been waiting for.Snape is a sad hero, a truly brave man. I cried when I saw his death and story... The part when he collapses when he sees Lilly's dead body made me burst into tears. The forest scene is very intense. And then there is the worst scene in the movie... Voldenort's disgusting fetus like blood covered disturbing body. It's not in a brief glimpse like Snape's death, It's fully graphical and disgusting! The final duel is epic and scary too... 'Let's finish this the way we started it.. Together!' Then they fly over Hogwarts and it all ends in the courtyard. Voldemort is broken to pieces and that looks like a papermade Tom that falls apart! Those scenes make you think: 'The Chamber of Secrets was truly wonderful and joyful, but this...! Don't bring kids to this movie!' The epilogue makes you cry and it is a proof that this is the best movie, with the most wonderful ending ever.. the happiest I have yet seen! **'The end is just the beginning!'**",10,7,16,13 July 2011
