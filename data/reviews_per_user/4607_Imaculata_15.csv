It," Does a much better job at the suspense and characters
","When reviewing this film, it is almost impossible to ignore the older TV movie that came before it. While I greatly enjoyed Tim Curry's portrayal of the killer clown, the TV movie hasn't endured the test of time well. The TV movie was not without its flaws; most notably in the special effects, acting and the actual horror. So it is great to see another director have a go at translating the source material to the screen. Personally I feel that whenever a movie is remade, something new has to be added, or something needs to be improved over the original. I am happy to say that this is definitely the case with this remake.The 2017 version of It immediately distances itself from the TV movie, by being a lot more violent regarding how Georgie dies. It mostly follows the same beats as the TV movie, but I feel it is more successful in fleshing out the characters (especially the children) and in setting the stakes. It is also a lot more suspenseful, and manages to more effectively communicate the effects that 'It' has on the town itself, and not just on the children.It has quite a lot of jump scares, but several are really well done. I was fortunate enough to view this movie with an audience that was susceptible to It's scares, which always makes a horror movie a lot more enjoyable to watch. It is great to see the entire audience jump and scream simultaneously, and be thoroughly invested in the movie.That said, I do feel that Tim Curry was a better clown. Curry's performance was more nuanced and realistic, like an actual adult that preys on innocent children. Whereas in this new rendition, the clown is perhaps the least frightening thing in the movie. Curry felt more like an actual threat, whereas the clown in this version mostly just flails his arms a lot, while running at the children, and not doing much else. This undermines the suspense a bit, because it feels like the clown is holding its punches throughout the movie. And the final confrontation with the clown made the clown even less threatening. I'm also not a fan of the clown's new design. It now looks like an obvious scary clown, that is trying too hard to be scary. While Curry's clown looked like a regular clown at first glance, which I ultimately find a lot more scary. But in other areas I was pleasantly surprised with the visual design. The sets are gorgeous and convincing, the clown's transformations do look creepy, and benefit a lot from modern visual effects. I also love that we got a whole different take on It's deadlights (although not called out as such during the film). But the story has two parts of course. And so it remains to be seen if the second movie will be just as good. With the TV movie, when it came to the part with the adults, the acting was pretty terrible. And the ending was greatly undermined by the limited effects of that time. That part is left for a sequel with the 2017 version, which I think is a good choice. It will leave them more time to flesh out the adults, and build a more coherent ending to a story that truth be told is all over the place. But will they be able to get us just as invested in the stuff with the adults, as they did with the children? I guess we'll have to wait and see when the second movie comes out.",9,2,3,5 October 2017
Unbreakable," Perfect in what it sets out to do. Could not have been improved on.
","I rate this movie a solid 10, and I feel that whenever you rate any movie a 10, it deserves a very good explanation. I don't rate movies based on what I think of other movies in that genre. Nor do I compare movies to other movies made by the same director. So, while I could compare this to The Sixth Sense, and say that I like The Sixth Sense better... How is that a good reason for a lower rating? Does that mean this movie deserves a lower score? I believe movies should be judged on their own, as stand alone products. And as a film, this movie is perfect in what it sets out to accomplish.The movie simply has a fantastic cinematography. Every shot seems thoroughly planned out, and shot as if shooting a frame from a comic book. There are fantastic long shots in this movie, that are not just thrown in as a gimmick, but with a deliberate purpose. Some shots simply hold on a specific perspective. Too few movies seem to understand this classic style. Modern movies constantly cut. Cut, cut cut... -and this is ruining movies. Just hold a shot for a few seconds! Have some patience for crying out loud! And that's what this movie does. It takes its time, and it demands some patience from its audience. You don't need to constantly cut to new camera angles, when you can simply move the camera. And the soundtrack is the final ingredient that makes it all work. It is heroic at times, and also tender and romantic when it needs to. It is in my opinion one of James Newton Howard's best scores.No, this is not an action movie. It is a slow drama. It is a story that needs to be told slowly. Some may regard this as a flaw. I argue that this movie would not be improved upon by making it faster. It is that slow building atmosphere that makes the movie so good. It is well acted, and it is one of the few movies in which I find Samuel L Jackson totally believable as a character who is not shouting profanities all the time. In fact, this may be one of his best acting roles. Bruce Willis is also fantastic in this. I also feel that not a single line of dialogue is off, or out of place.Some have called the plot twist predictable. Well, I've seen plenty of people be caught off guard by the twist, myself included, so I see nothing wrong with it. But while the twist is a good way to bookend the movie, I think where the movie really shines is simply the fact that it as a lot of heart. It is sentimental, it is romantic, and it romanticizes the idea of the real life superhero. That is what it is all about, and if you can't embrace that concept, then this movie is simply not for you. There are scenes in this movie that still get the waterworks running, and get me crying man-tears. Call me sentimental, but the movie works for me. Maybe because it touches on a topic that is dear to my heart: The idea of the real life hero.",10,0,1,3 May 2016
Train to Busan," Zombies on a train
","This Korean zombie film is a real gem. It's a very recent movie, and you can tell they had a good budget for this. What I love about these sorts of movies, is when it's all about the survivors having to be clever to overcome frightening and deadly obstacles.Train to Busan is both original in its concept, and great in its execution. It is a movie that is quite clever in how it uses its core premise; the train. They do so much with the concept, plus they keep it relatively realistic. The movie also delivers some great social criticism. Like is often the case with zombie movies, the real monsters are the people.Is it a perfect film? No. I thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic. And there was some use of CGI which looked a bit fake. Specifically some plumes of smoke and fires, and those are the sorts of things they could have done practically. At the same time, the movie deserves praise for it's huge establishing shots where various large train stations and towns really look completely abandoned. There's also a couple of set pieces towards the end that are really impressive.Most importantly, the movie isn't predictable. I had no idea who would live and who would die. And best of all, there were many scenes where I was just grinning and laughing. The movie is fun. The sheer chaos on display in this film is very enjoyable. The movie does not devolve into the grotesque, like so many movies in this genre do. Instead, it focuses on the characters, and on interesting plot developments. And it has so much fun with the genre. It is also a very well paced, and well shot film. It is filmed and paced very much like an American movie.If all of this sounds like a ton of praise... I guess it is. It's a very enjoyable movie. Go see it.",8,2,4,25 September 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One - Screen writing zero
","I wanted to like this movie so badly, but I just couldn't. I am a huge Star Wars fan, but the screen writing for this film is just terrible. That's not to say that there aren't things to like in this film. But it's the huge amount of fan service that kills it.None of the characters, except the main character, get any development. The introduction of all the characters is disjointed and ham-fisted. And especially in the beginning the movie jumps all over the place hastily. It is as if they took very little time to write actual scenes.The visual effects are really good. But unfortunately the movie relies very heavily on the inclusion of one completely CGI actor, who simply does not look convincing. They give him a lot of screen time and lines too, but it is just so distracting.But the biggest problem is that it is just crammed full of fan service. The movie feels very strongly like a piece of fan fiction. There are also no surprises at all in the film. It is predictable from beginning to end. The movie keeps throwing references to the original trilogy, or to the Expanded Universe in your face, to the point where it becomes extremely cringe worthy.The finale is spectacular, but by that point you still don't care about any of the characters or the plot... the movie fails to make the audience really care. A spectacular finale without emotion, is like a fireworks show without an audience: A lot of noise and wasted money.",6,151,312,14 December 2016
The Babadook," Most people will not get it, and rate the movie accordingly
","This movie's biggest strength, is also it's biggest weakness. It's a cleverly constructed horror story with multiple layers. The problem is that it never explains itself, nor does it even drop the faintest hint by the end. Thus, people who went into this thinking this is just a generic monster flick, will come out of it feeling pretty much the same. But that is not what this is.The movie is far more intelligent than a lot of people give it credit for. It's also a credit to the excellent direction, that this movie never delivers some sort of forced explanation of what it is really about. Without spoiling the movie, this film tricks you into thinking you are going to see a typical horror movie, but it ventures into far darker psychological territory. But like I said, most viewers will not get it. This is why this movie has received some terrible ratings from some viewers, but this is not an accurate representation of the actual quality of the movie.For the other half of the audience though, this is one heck of a ride. I suspect some viewers will get it halfway through, and some two-thirds into the movie. And everyone else won't get it at all. The acting is stunning, the cinematography and lighting are amazing, and I also really like the sound editing (except when they use a sound effect that's clearly from a very old and overused sound library). I found it especially compelling how the movie shifts focus several times during the story, regarding who the villain is.See it, and judge it for yourself. Do not let impulsive ratings fool you.",8,50,96,7 January 2015
Interstellar," Better than 2001, and that's saying a lot
","A sci-fi master piece.Well... goes to show that you really never can trust any of the critics. This movie is a master piece. I would easily put it up there with the likes of 2001 a space odyssey. Why did I listen to the reviews, and not go see this in the theater? This movie blew me away. I was not expecting much, but I got so much more. The science is solid, great acting, great direction, and a great plot. If you've been to recent Hollywood blockbusters like Jurassic World, you'd almost think competent screen writing is dead. I mean come on! Weaponized raptors? But this movie is a breath of fresh air. I already liked director Christopher Nolan for his Dark Knight trilogy, and The Prestige. But I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did.It takes its time to build up the story, and the characters. The plot got me hooked almost immediately. But where the movie really shines is the science. When I watch a sci-fi movie, I want to be wowed by gadgets that seem credible and original. I want to see future technology, and not nonsense. I want to see the characters make competent decisions, and not act completely irrational just for the convenience of the plot. And boy, this movie surprised me with how well written the characters are, and how logical they act. The plot did not take any cheap short cuts. it cleverly avoided the typical Hollywood plot writing, by having the characters make the right decisions, while still coming up with obstacles that are credible. On top of that, during the last part of the movie it drops a huge twist on the audience, that I honestly did not see coming. I won't spoil it here.What I also like, is how the movie takes its time to show the aftermath of all the events. It doesn't just end, but goes on for a bit longer to show us most of the things that we want to see. There were a few moments where it seemed the movie fast forwarded a bit too fast, which was confusing at times. So the movie does demand your full attention. I suspect that maybe some scenes were cut out to reduce the running time, and may have affected the pacing of some events. I would be very curious to see an extended cut, if it exists.Regarding the aftermath and the ending, I think this is where I actually like this movie better than 2001 a space odyssey. I know that is controversial, and many people would probably yell out 'heresy' at the mere thought of liking this over Kubrick's classic. To give a quick recap of my thoughts on this famous Kubrick movie, I think it's too much style over substance. The pacing is too slow and artsy-fartsy, making the movie a chore to sit through. It has its moments for sure, and the cinematography is a work of art. However, the ending while memorable, is also very vague and open to interpretation. One might even call it a bit unsatisfying or lazy. A cop out. So perhaps this provides some context to why I like the ending of Interstellar better; it answers all of your questions. I felt the sequel to 2001, called 2010, was also much better movie as well in many ways. While it didn't have the amazing cinematography of Kubrick, it was better paced, and did answer all the questions of the previous movie and of its own. Plus it was just much more enjoyable to sit through, even on repeated viewings. I cannot say the same for 2001.So why the comparisons with 2001? Well the two movies have a lot in common, especially near the end. If you see the movie, you'll see what I mean.But I think I like Interstellar better. Yes, I know. Scowl at me if you want. But I think Kubrick is not the holy grail of film making, and this is a better sci-fi movie that pretty much follows very similar themes. Perhaps Interstellar would have never existed if it weren't for movies like 2001, and that is a fair argument. But I think ultimately that Interstellar is just way more satisfying. It is not afraid to bring the plot full circle, and answer all of the questions.",9,1,5,5 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," As much a Captain America as an Iron Man movie
","It is amazing to me that a movie like this manages to be not just a great sequel to The Winter Soldier, but also to Iron Man 3, AND Age of Ultron, and still also be a good movie. A movie like this could easily crumble under the weight of so many characters, and yet it doesn't. Most of them get plenty of plot and an arc. Enough time is also dedicated to the new characters that this movie introduces. This is not just a mindless action movie, like Age of Ultron. This is a pretty clever movie, with a solid plot, some red herrings, and twists. Of course not all characters get equal screen time. Thor and The Hulk aren't in the movie at all. And Hawk Eye is barely in it either. Other characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow do get a decent plot. Vision struggles with human behavior, Wanda struggles with people being afraid of her, and Black Widow is caught in the middle, and struggling to pick a side. But in the end, I found myself strongly agreeing with Tony Stark. Even by the end of the movie, me and my friends had strong disagreements about which character was in the right. I find this a clear sign of a very strong plot.Where the movie especially shines is it's first half. The movie spends a lot of time explaining the conflict at the heart of the story, and addresses the cost of all the absurd destruction from The Avengers, Iron Man, The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. There's really good dialogue in this film. I loved hearing every characters point of view, and it's hard to argue with any of them. They all have solid motives. The new character Black Panther isn't just thrown in at random. He is central to the plot. And the plot feels very serious, just like with The Winter Soldier. It isn't until the middle of the movie, that it embraces the over the top comic book action and the humor from The Avengers. So in a way, this movie is half Winter Soldier, and half The Avengers.As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the best so far. It stands in stark contrast to the recent Batman V Superman. How can one movie be such a mess, and another do so much right? It honestly is some kind of miracle. Considering all the characters they need to juggle in this movie, and all the plot threads they need to tie together, this is one heck of a script.The action is also top notch. There's a lot of really good car chases and free running action scenes in this. This makes some of the action feel very grounded in reality, just as in The Winter Soldier. I also got the feeling that they made plenty of use of practical effects. Of course there is also plenty of use of CGI and this. But at no point did anything really stand out to me. Again, this is quite a miracle, considering all the different effect studios involved with this.Stay around till after the credits. Because the movie has both a mid-credits sequence, and an after-credits sequence.",9,9,17,13 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Entertaining, but with a lot of problems
","Let me say up front that this is not a bad movie. But I notice a lot of Potter-fans are looking at this movie through rose-colored glasses, and are unable to see its obvious flaws. This is a pretty flawed movie. Fun, but not great.But lets start with the good. The characters are fun, the visuals are stunning and impressive. And the amazing Potter atmosphere of whimsy is all over this film. I also liked how the music of the movie starts with the soft Potter-theme, and then immediately abandons it for the rest of the film, and sticks with its own new theme music. There's plenty of references for fans to enjoy, but you do not need to be a Potter fan to understand what is going on in the film. This movie can very much stand on its own.But now the bad. The movie seems to forget that it has a plot for about half of its running time. For most of the movie we follow the main character in his quest to retrieve his missing animals all over New York, which is fun, but has very little to do with the main plot. It seems as if the movie suddenly remembers that it has a villain (who is briefly mentioned with quick flashes of newspapers during the opening) and it forgets that it still has to build towards a finale. Out of nowhere the final act is suddenly dropped into the movie. That is a bit sloppy, and it leaves the main villain very undeveloped. I also think many of the characters are a bit shallow, and steeped in stereotypes and clichés.Technically, the movie feels a bit sloppily edited at times, which makes some scenes hard to follow. And especially during the final act there are a lot of bright flashing lights that are a pain on the eyes if you are sitting in a dark theater.That said, I was still entertained. But the film critic in me feels that this should have been a lot better. I also noticed that I had a hard time remembering the names of most of the main characters.",7,0,3,21 November 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A lot better than I expected
","This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. Reviews of this movie have been pretty cynical and negative, but I don't think the negativity is deserved. This is a fun movie. A lot of the old cast returned for this film, and it bookends the series in a lovely way. It's not perfect, and we'll get into that below. But if you are looking for a fun adventure movie, with a lot of laughs, this movie fills all those check boxes.Lets first get the negatives out of the way, which are few, but deserve mention. The two new leads in this film are rookies, and not strong enough as actors to carry this movie. They are adequate, but never succeed in convincing you that they deserve being in this movie, contrary to Orlando Bloom and Kyra Knightley in the past. Fortunately the old cast are able to bare the weight of the movie, with both Rush and Depp doing a great job.There's a scene where they show a young Jack Sparrow, and as usual, the effect for that is not good. Please Hollywood, stop de-aging actors with CGI! It looks terrible. His mouth looked like it had just been pasted on. It was really weird and jarring. Not as jarring as CGI Peter Cushing in Rogue One, but pretty jarring none the less. There is no reason to do this with CGI. Just cast a young actor who looks enough like a young Depp and you're done. It's cheaper, and the audience will accept it more easily, instead of being distracted by a lousy effect.The script is okay, although there is a lot of plot convenience, and a lot of stuff that defies physics. But I can look past that, because this is not a movie franchise that should be taken too seriously. The dialogue in the beginning is a bit stiff though, especially when the two new leads are basically telling the audience their backstories. Show, don't tell! (But don't show it with bad de-aging CGI!) Now for the positives, Depp does a great job. I thought that I would be bored of Jack Sparrow by now, but I guess not. Both he and Rush seemed to be having fun, and giving it their best. And it is fun watching these actors just having a lot of joy on set. The humor is also really on point. Most of the jokes work.The action is pretty fantastic. I was amazed by some of the crazy action scenes that they came up with, especially during the very strong opening of the film. Yes, it is absurd and over the top, but there was a lot of practical stuff, and just good old stunt work. It was so much fun to watch. I feel that they could have ended the film perhaps with a big battle, but the ending we got instead sufficed.The design of the ghost pirates and their ship is really well done. And the undead sharks (which you can see in the trailer) were pretty creepy. I also liked the quality of most of the special effects. The ships all look really good. The high production values are clearly on display. There's some green screening here and there, but I think the general audience will not even notice that. The set designs are fantastic, and there's just a lot of awesome practical stuff in the film.So as you can tell, I had a lot of fun at this film. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Stick around till after the credits for the usual post credits scene. But I could be mistaken, but isn't this going to be the last PotC film? Then why are we getting another post credits teaser? And why does the post credits scene seem to contradict the finale of the movie? Ehh... whatever.",8,5,11,2 June 2017
The Witch," Fails to deliver on its suspense and on the ending
","I watched Deathgasm, Sharknado 2, and The Witch in a row. But ironically, this was the least entertaining movie of the three.Yes, the acting, setting and mood are fantastic. Yes the cinematography is great. And yes, it has a really good creepy soundtrack. But not much happens in the movie! It's boring. Me and my friends had to keep making jokes to maintain our attention. The movie tries so hard to build suspense, but when the suspense ultimately has no pay off, it undermines the stakes of the movie. And you know, as nonreligious viewers we're just not all that frightened by goats, devils, and witchcraft. You have to try really hard to make that scary. And I'm told there's plenty of people that think this movie is really scary. But I don't see it.But what really does the movie in, is the fact that it has an unsatisfying ending. You can see it coming from miles away, and there isn't much of a pay off or a twist. And that's a shame, because everyone involved delivers a stellar performance.Ultimately though, The Witch fails to deliver.",6,0,2,2 June 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Entertaining, but clearly shows this was meant to be two movies
","I came out of this movie feeling entertained, but also a bit underwhelmed. It was fun, but it never really succeeded to connect with me. Plus it is a movie that has to exist in the shadow of the previous movie, and also one hugely successful older trilogy. Its not a bad movie, not at all. But you can clearly tell that this story was never intended to be stretched out to three movies, especially since the dragon dies before the opening title. So it comes as no surprise that the rest of the movie is just armies fighting, and a lot of fan fiction being thrown at the screen. A lot of cameos and references feel horrible forced, especially when the movie tries to throw an Aragorn reference in (Thank the gods that Vigo said no to a cameo). This movie did not need this many cameos. But it's kind of like the writers were shrugging at the audience, while saying 'That's all we got'.So while the movie is a decent entertaining fantasy flick, it doesn't really resonate, or hit any real emotional notes with the audience. It tries desperately to throw in some drama, but this only reminds us that we still don't know most of the dwarfs by name, nor have they gotten any character development. I also suspect there are quite a number of missing scenes, because some things literally pop up out of thin air (such as a bunch of mountain goats that appear completely out of nowhere).The acting is good though, and everyone delivers a decent performance. The special effects are great, and the creature designs and costumes are all very well done. And the movie closes with a smooth transition to the Fellowship of the Ring, which I think was well done. But this movie is definitely not as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Thankfully, unlike Return of the King, the ending to this movie is not drawn out. It ends exactly when it needs to.",7,1,4,21 December 2014
Arrival," Not as clever as many reviews make it out to be
","I have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed with this movie. This was touted as one of the best and most intelligent sci-fi movies of the year, and it didn't quite live up to all that praise. It's not a bad movie though. The acting is solid, the directing, sound design and visuals are really good. But the story is kind of bland. For a movie that is all about communication, I thought it was a little bit odd that the most obvious way of communication (pictures) was completely ignored. The movie also depicts Russia and China as paranoid villains, while America of course saves the day. In light of history, this is hard to believe. It is also very difficult to believe that China, a country whose alphabet is literally a bunch of pictures, would not try to communicate with pictures, and instead is presented as the aggressor against the aliens. In the end, the climax of the movie is basically one big Deux Ex Machina, and that is a tough pill to swallow. Could they not have thought of a resolution that was a little bit more clever, and not the equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat? The whole movie is about communication, so shouldn't the movie end with a break through in communication? So while this is not a bad movie, it's not a very good sci-fi movie. It needed a better script.",7,4,7,19 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Yes, it really is that good
","This movie does everything right. Right from the start, I was sucked into the story. It may not have the sort of punch that Mad Max Fury Road had, but there are so many ways this could have gone wrong, and I'm so glad they did it right. Lets first touch upon the main criticism that I've seen about this movie. People say that it follows the structure of the original movie beat for beat. And yes, this is true. However, the movie also does plenty of innovation and world building of its own. And so this movie does feel new, even though it follows the same structure.The movie pays a lot of homage to the old movies, but not in that annoying Kingdom of the Crystal Skull way. There aren't constant wink winks to the audience. Instead they recognize lots of stuff from the old movies in a loving way. These are the sort of nods to the old movies that feel just right. Stars like Carry Fisher and Harrison Ford aren't just brought back for a cameo, but play an important part in the movie. In fact, Han Solo is one of the main characters throughout the entire movie. Leia's role is decidedly smaller, but still important. I also felt Harrison Ford did a really good job. He really was Han Solo again. Carry Fisher is just okay, but Ford IS Han Solo.I was afraid that perhaps the new characters would not grow on me, but fortunately that wasn't the case. Finn's role is just perfect, plus it allows the movie to give the audience more insight into the structure of the empire, and what being a Storm Trooper is all about. This is the world building I was talking about earlier. The movie answers a lot of questions, even the simple ones. Rey is also a great character, but the exact opposite of Finn. Plus I really enjoyed the way the movie dispels common damsel in distress tropes with her. It was almost a slightly feminist movie in that sense, but in a good way. I think Rey's character makes the Star Wars universe more accessible to a young female audience, and that thought makes me smile a little. The movie does its best to show us that Rey is perfectly fine at saving herself.The opening shot of the original Star Wars had its audience literally ducking in their seats, and thus succeeded at making you feel the oppressive rule of the empire with a mere visual. But The Force Awakens nails that too. Rather than steal those shots, they have new shots to achieve the same thing. A lot of the shots of imperial ships are shot at an angle from below, so they look really big.The special effects in this are also amazing. There is so much use of real sets and practical effects. Tons of creatures are puppets, animatronics, or suit-characters. -Even some of the really big creatures are puppets, I suspect. This makes the world look real. Sure, when it comes to big battle scenes there is also liberal use of CGI. But unlike Age of Ultron, it doesn't look like CGI. It looks like the characters are really there, I also really like the way they show the interior of various ships, and show how the technology works. It makes it all feel real.Plot wise, the movie succeeds at making the First Order feel threatening, by showing the cruelty of the empire early on. This is something that the old movies never really succeeded at. They always made the Storm Troopers look like bumbling cannon fodder, -but not so in this movie. They also have some fun with the villain, which is welcome. He isn't just some two dimensional character.Another thing that surprised me, is how they expand on the lore of The Force. We get to see new ways in which the Force can be used, and they focus more on the mystical elements of it, and don't even mention the midichlorians from the prequels. And we get to see the Force being used a lot. If you think about it, Darth Vader didn't use the Force all that much in the original trilogy, and neither did Obi Wan. But in the Force Awakens, we see liberal use of it.So with this avalanche of praise, is there anything bad about the movie? Yes, but it is only minor. The movie had me along for the majority of it, up until the end. The final part of the movie is where it kind of lost me. And it just didn't blow me away, like Mad Max Fury Road did. It is perhaps unfair to expect a movie to have that much of an impact, because the few times that it has happened, it was always a surprise. But that's not the only problem. The ending just was a bit lacking. It feels like the movie doesn't end on a high note, like the original movies all did. It tries to end on a cliff hanger, but it doesn't really work. And perhaps the predictability of the ending is to blame for that. I also felt some of the villains were a bit silly. Kylo Ren is just fine. But some of the others are a bit goofy (and they have goofy names too).If you have children you owe it to them to take them to this movie. I mean it. Take them to this movie right now! They will love you for it! Come on! Reserve those tickets already. And if you are still a child at heart, then go see it as well.",9,5,23,20 December 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Our best joke was one about butt stuff
","'Shaky cam, CGI blood, and poor fight choreography.' 'Never insult other better movies in your own film' 'We thought our best joke was one about butt stuff, so we saved it till the end of the film' 'We thought James Bond parodies hadn't been done to death already' 'How much product placement can we put in one film...?'If the above quotes haven't yet helped you decide if this is a movie for you, maybe the rest of my review will seal the deal. Kingsman is a poor man's James Bond parody. It is a movie painfully aware that it is not taking the spy genre seriously, and it keeps reminding us by literally mentioning how serious the James Bond movies have become. But that's strike number one. Don't mention or criticize a better movie, in your own movie. It also serves us the line 'a movie is only as good as its villain'. Bitter irony, since the movie has a pretty poor villain, in the form of Samuel L Jackson with a terribly forced lisp. But there is a lot bad about this movie.Lets start with the tone. This movie is inconsistent with it tone. It starts off as a comedy, right with the animation of the cartoony opening credits, yet then follows up with a serious tone, and then switching back to comedy for the last half of the film. It is as if the movie was written by two very conflicted writers, with vastly different views about the tone of the film. The movie takes its biggest deviation in tone right about the moment where it serves us with a very violent, and poorly choreographed fight scene in a church.Then the comedy. The movie aims for the very lowest bar in comedy. When a joke about anal sex is the best joke that you were saving for the end, you should retire as a comedy writer. The movie got only a few chuckles from the easily entertained in the audience. But several people simply left the theater. That made me realize that those people were probably wiser than me. Comedy isn't easy. James Bond was funny, because it tried to be a good exciting film, while having a charming lead drop some occasional humor in it, without completely destroying the suspense. It kept the action lighthearted, without completely going for cheap laughs. Austin Powers on the other hand, was a full-on parody that was all about having a good laugh at all the characters. It wasn't being insulting to James Bond or other spy thrillers. It was just having fun with it, and you could tell there was love in it too. Not so much with Kingsman. The humor occasionally felt spiteful, and almost offensive.The fight choreography. I already mentioned this before, but shaky cam is just a poor way to hide bad fighting. It is what directors do when they want to ruin a fight scene, or when their actors aren't very good at fighting. By the way, it seems as if the director thinks that a hail of bullets is like rain during a bicycle ride. You just hold your hand before your eyes, and keep going, and it won't hit you.Now the soundtrack, is occasionally pretty good, when it is isn't assaulting you with annoying licensed pop music during action scenes.The story, is terrible. I know that it is intentionally trying to serve us a nonsense spy thriller plot. But it was just lazily written. A large plot of the finale revolves around Hollywood once again not understanding how hacking works, or how satellites work, or how computers work.I was severely disappointed. Several people left the theater during the movie and they did not return. I should have done the same.",5,4,11,24 February 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beyond Thunderdome on acid, with a huge budget
","I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!",9,27,49,16 May 2015
