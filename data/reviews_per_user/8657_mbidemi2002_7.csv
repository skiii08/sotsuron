Lucky Number Slevin," Courageous, Audacious, Brash!
","In the end the story is pretty basic, there isn't so much originality. Even the way the story is told is not something that has never-been- before-seen. What is amazing is the confidence and deftness with which we are steered through this tale.This confirms that it's not just the story but how you tell it- suspense, puzzles, loopholes that later become closed, mysteries that become solved...a masterful telling of a forgettable story and after seeing Wicker Park, i can say Paul McGuigan is a talent that can only get better.Bruce Willis- I can see why Shyamalan respects him so much...he embodies a character and makes it his own. Every other performance will always pale in comparison to his though Hartnett gets top marks for trying. Sir Ben is always like a ghost-actor in that he blends so well with his character that you don't see him only his character (he made such a believable Rabbi!) and Freeman's laid back style is ever so strong. Lucy Liu has come of age as an actress- top marks for interpreting such a surreal role.The cinematography is the most wonderful thing about this film, one scene literally took my breath away! and the camera angles are worked with such scientific precision. Some of the decor has to be commented upon as it blended so well with the story and I can truly say 10 out of 10 for lighting which was always enough and never too much.The story was courageous, audacious and brash and this is partly why this film could be pulled off not to mention the first rate cast! Altogether, a great Directing effort and a film worthy of Slevin out of ten.",7,0,1,28 September 2007
3:10 to Yuma," mixed feelings...
","I saw this movie two days ago and I must admit I had mixed feelings. I'll start with the good which includes; (1)A stellar performance by Christian Bale (2)a powerful, subtle, well balanced story (3) the casting of Russell Crowe who I have to admit is a joy to watch no matter what he does.Now for the bad; (1)Sometimes Russell Crowe didn't quite convince me (see the awkward way he looks at his 'own' drawings) (2)sometimes the plot is repetitive and doesn't really move forward, rather it just goes around in circles.I have mixed feelings because this is a good film by any standards but you just get the feeling that if one or two aspects received a tighter polish this could have been a great film.In the end it's like The Proposition but on wobblier legs. I have to say I still rather enjoyed it. Thanks.",7,1,2,12 October 2009
Watchmen," Not your regular super-hero flick!
","Have you seen Zack Snyder's latest vision? If not what are you waiting for? I walked into this one thinking 'Not another super-hero/special-powers movie' but when I was walking out, that was the furthest thing from my mind.The plot is not pristine, it sputters and weaves and loses it's way sometimes but the recurrent theme that humanity and even the best among it is flawed remains poignant throughout the film. I felt as if I had been given the closest thing to the Sin-City experience I had years ago. The violence was seminal, the gore welcome. The characters brilliantly played (all hail Rorshach!) As for camera-work, what words can suffice! It was artistic and hit every right note as with 300. The color, texture and balance as though carefully and obsessively picked to be beyond our expectations. The camera fulfilled my every desire. As for the music, I'll never hear the song Hallelujah and feel the same way again! Zack Snyder has given me faith in filmmakers. That there are still some out there who care not only about how many people come to see their film but also how they feel during and after it. Thank you.",8,4,10,31 March 2009
Wanted," Not a good film
","This is not a good film, I don't care what anyone says. I went to see this film with so much expectation that I was left disappointed. It just goes to show how film-making has become formula and how originality has become synonymous with unbelievability. They took a great cast, a Director with out-of-this-world aspirations, some mind-blowing special effects on the shaky foundations of a crappy story.This is not a good film I repeat. It was sloppy in some parts, relied too much on special effects and looks like a hormone-fueled fantasy of a fifteen year old. Did this movie go through any developmental process? There are so many loose ends and let's just say that for someone who is a die-hard sci-fi fan, I didn't believe any of the crap these guys were dishing out. Believe it or not, there is a line where outrageous becomes ridiculous.I feel sorry for the true film-watchers who still remember what a good film is because with a rating of 7 for this crap, the worst is yet to come. May God help us!",4,2,6,5 September 2008
The Hurt Locker," Am I the only person who just didn't get it?
","I hate watching movies after the buzz because you're more likely to feel let down if it's not as fantastic as everyone said. I don't think that was what happened in this case.I was so thrilled to hear a female won best Director but I'm very disappointed now I've seen the film.Did the Academy blindfold themselves and throw darts at the wall to choose best picture? Inglorious Basterds, District 9 and even the uber-commercial Avatar are far, far better than this film. Pityingly I haven't seen the other nominated films.There was nothing original, exciting, different, entertaining about this movie.I found it tiresome, boring and I was unable to connect emotionally with any character. Sloppy dialogue, lazy film-making. It became almost painful to watch.Maybe the Academy thought giving this film a bunch of Oscars was their own way of fighting terrorism without leaving the country.They only succeeded in reducing the value of the awards.Thank you.",2,3,5,3 June 2010
Black Panther," Why are we afraid to be honest about this film?
","When I first saw this movie I wanted to write an honest review but I couldnt. On twitter, whatsapp everywhere are people waiting to tell you how racist, unsupportive,jealous any black person is for not thinking this is the best movie ever cos it has lots of black people in it. Today I watched Thor Ragnarok for the first time and I can no longer stay silent. There's a reason why I watch superhero films and it's to be wowed. Where were the scenes that saw black panther kicking ass, where were the scenes that showed his character develop, that showed the other character's arc? Where were the fight scenes that should have blown my mind away? Where was the story that had suspense and plot twists? Those things were absent from this film. There was only one funny scene. This film is quite dull and borING. I rated it two because of the Dino Melaye. we should all be honest enough to admit that the success of this film has very little to do with merit and a lot to do with sentiment. Thanks Marvel for the masterclass in film marketing.",2,6,9,31 March 2018
300," 300, the Oscars are calling your name!
","300, the Oscars are calling your name! That is how I felt after seeing this movie. It's always refreshing to see the film medium pushed to its limits as in Sin City, The Matrix and other groundbreaking movies. It's encouraging for movie-goers to know that a director is feeling for every boundary to give them the best a story can offer as was done with 300.The Cinematography was flawless, some scenes literally took my breath away. The Direction was tight with all the seams invisible unlike other epics. The cast; Brilliant, a new God has been found in Gerard Butler and I gladly worship. The script was impressive and faultless, Who came up with those lines?? The intensity of this film is breathless, it just doesn't let up. The artistry is something extraordinary. It's something when a film as highly stylized as this doesn't leave you with a yearning for reality.In summary, an immensely powerful film, one of the best cinema experiences of a lifetime and a must-see for every man, woman and supervised child. Brilliant!",9,5,11,3 May 2007
