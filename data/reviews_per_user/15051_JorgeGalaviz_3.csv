The King's Speech," Great movie
","King George VI is a stutterer. Before becoming king, it is the Duke of York, but the weight of his stammer has always condemned him tremendous anxiety in his speeches. Lionel Logue, his therapist, will try to help his stutter.The cinematography, the art direction and the acting is magnific. And the plot is very, very well accomplished. Nevertheless, I did found some axioms on the course of the story. But none of those little sins matter when you see the whole picture, a picture that shows us that even in royalty, that even a King was overwhelmed by his own shadow, as every mortal is.The movie played with my nerves, specially at that masterfully portrayed final scene. My feet were sweating, so as my hands, and my heart was bumping like if ran at 150 km/H. It's beautiful movie, it is imperfect as it is intriguing.",9,0,1,1 May 2016
Requiem for a Dream," Masterfully revolting, but not quit realistic.
","I've watched this movie twice already, and I'm pretty sure that's enough for me. But it's curious, because the film isn't the most realistic one. Many things happening in the movie are totally pessimistic, even when things are going 'good' you are not conceiving a hope, you just think of how naive the characters are being. They're all junkies, junkies of television, of amphetamines, of self destruction, of heroin, of sex, of money, of attention. And that's the disgusting part, the characters are not being humans, they're being lab rats whom keep pressing the pleasure button.I don't know if this stuff just add useless drama and pessimism to the movie, or actually make it a better film, but what I do know is that the message it gives us is perfectly shown, and it's not a direct criticism to the use of drugs, is for all addictions, as we all humans have an addiction. I think it's trying to tell us to not be consumed by our demons, our addictions. And that is what makes me give it an 8. It might not be perfect and realistic, it might don't show us the hole nature of humanity, but it does expose one of its most vicious and repulsive characteristics. And, because of that I think is one hell of an artwork.",8,0,1,1 May 2016
Trainspotting," Choose drugs, watch the movie, and choose again.
","The movie tells us the story of Renton, who's a heroin addict, and want to quit the habit, but his will fail several times in the movie.I thought this one was going to be a non-watchable-depressing- Requiem-For-A-Dream-British-movie, and I was so wrong. There was just one thing of the movie I never get, the The Worst Toilet In Scotland scene, it was masterfully disgusting, but I didn't really get the point of Renton swimming in an ocean-like toilet. I figured it was some kind of metaphor, but honestly, I didn't understand it. Might be my mistake or the movie's.Anyway, when you compare this one to Requiem For A Dream, you realize there's no reason for doing it. Especially when it comes to the elements the movie use to invoke the viewer's feelings. In here, you sympathize with the characters, you expect them to climb out from their holes of addiction, and you have hope (or at least with the main character). You even, somehow, believe they (or he) don't have a problem because Rent managed to quit his habits. The movie gave me a clear message: choose your path and your actions, but considerate this movie, when the drug-use decision come.Considering the message the movie wanted to give, and the message actually given, I'll score it with 9 out of 10. I feel the movie didn't go too deep into realism of the drugs use, but gave us a masterfully written and very important lesson: DON'T USE DRUGS, CHOOSE LIFE.",9,0,2,30 April 2016
