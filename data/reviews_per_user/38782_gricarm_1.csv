It," Boring
","I think I had been bait to watch this movie by watching the trailer. Well, all I can say that the trailer is the best scene compare to another scene in this movie. I did not find this movie any scary and to be honest, I move my eye from the screen for quite a long time because of the story telling was so damn boring. They feed to much information to the audience while the child actor and actress in this movie, in my opinion, cannot bring any suspense to me (well, except for the sewer scene). I am very disappointed after watching this movie because it is not what I have expected. In conclusion, this movie is no scary at all. It just IT.",2,1,6,5 October 2017
