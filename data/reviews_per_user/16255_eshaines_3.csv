The Blair Witch Project," Fifteen Years Later: Not Terrible for a 60K Budget
","I'm not sure what it is about this film that makes it interesting. By all accounts, it should be quite dull: much of it is shot in motion or out of focus by hand-held cameras, the dialogue is petty and tedious, there's an absence of sexual tension between the main characters, and much of what is feared throughout the film, while eerie, is merely suggestive of horror. Perhaps I am spoiled by modern day horror and suspense films, which are less understated, follow an explicit plot, and don't leave me wanting in terms of visual access. The 'agenda' of this film is still fear —we are to believe that even after one or two centuries, the so-called 'Blair Witch' still lives in those woods and is still out to kill, as evidenced by the eerie ending. An obscurity that doesn't ever quite seem resolved for me, and there is more than one, is what one man at the beginning of the 'documentary' tells the filmmakers: that a man was found guilty of killing some children and confessed to the crime—are we to think that the witch possessed this killer? Or were these unrelated crimes that just happened to be occurring in the same geographical area? It also seems to me that all of the folklore and mythology surrounding the Blair Witch deaths pertain to attacks on children—with the one exception of the men tortured on that rock whose bodies later mysteriously disappear—why would the witch go after children for so many years but then in the modern day attack these three grown adults? It is a possible statement that these three filmmakers were so consumed by naiveté and child-like curiosity for the macabre, or a rather dumb, stop-at-nothing passion for art, that they were mistaken for children by the witch, or at least considered to be one in the same. Because really, what thinking, rational adult would so discredit a history of serial killings—just for the reason that its roots were non- scientifically explained—to put themselves in what would potentially be harm's way? Aren't there a million other things to explore and about which to write and direct films? Ridiculous. This is the second time I've seen this film, the first time being early in high school, for me about thirteen or fourteen years ago. I watched it the first time at night, at a friend's house, and when the movie was over and I had nearly peed myself in fear, never having seen any movie quite like it, she insisted we go to the local woodsy lake area to light some fireworks—naturally I was petrified, tried to convince everyone it was a bad idea, but ended up ignored, and went. That was the first night I forced myself, for my own sanity, to make a distinction between film-based fear projected onto reality, and reality itself. Why would a witch come out of the woods in the middle of Dallas, TX, where I was at the time, when the witch in this film haunts a forest in Maryland, I asked myself. And so I found my firmer footing. It is only now, thirteen years later, in revisiting the movie to see if I still found it as scary, that I have decided to reevaluate it. I guess I could've done without the foul-mouthed protagonist—why on earth would I empathize with this woman who doesn't know how to speak without dropping an 'f-bomb' every other word? Not that I have a big problem with cursing to convey a certain amount of anger or frustration—but to hear it constantly, it was as if she were beating me over the head with it. Her male counterparts were far better behaved and easier to stomach as characters. I think that what works about the film is the gradual decay in the lead characters' morale. They begin their adventure peppy, excited, naive, almost cocky—and by the end of the film disintegrate into panic, rage, fear, cynicism, and desperation. I still get a kick out of seeing that extreme close-up of the leading lady in her beanie, only half of her face visible, welling up with tears, whispering: 'I'm afraid to close my eyes, I'm afraid to open them....' I think it's the first time in the movie one can really feel the film's trademark desperation and isolation these characters must have been internalizing as their project progressed. The movie's not perfect; there are some things I would've done differently: fewer, but more focused, less scattered interviews with locals (when in doubt, simplify, don't obscure your characters' motivations), interspersing steady cam shots with the hand-held, blurry ones—purely for palatability to the audience (you are trying to achieve the effect of a realistic out-in-the- woods experience, but isn't filmmaking just as much about satisfying an audience as pleasing the filmmaker?); some more clues as to what happened to Josh; and maybe, if the steady cam shots were included, when Mike drops the camera at the end, there would be a way to show the climax of the film without the girl having to pick up the camera herself and film—it is simply not believable that, in this state of panic, after having formally apologized to her and her colleagues' parents for her stubborn will to make this film, she would still want to film what was at that point a very desperate and unpleasant situation. For a budget of $60,000, I think they did a great job, though.Needless to say, I still won't be going on a hike in the unpaved, unmarked woods any time soon. In that regard, hats off to the writers and directors of this movie. Fifteen years later, and it still has that effect!",7,1,1,5 June 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Gorgeous and Surprising Directorial Talent
","I have nothing negative to say about this film. I am actually glad Iceland is becoming so popular in Hollywood these days, because it has long been a stronghold of natural wonder and cultural glory, just typically less likely to be seen on screen before than it is today. I don't even want to classify this film as a simple 'romantic comedy' because the comedy is not the driving force of this film (although the daydream vignettes do have quite a comical effect when put in the context of Mitty's reality), and because the romance seems to tie in quite strongly with Mitty's quest for self hood and adventure, which makes the film's love story deeper and ultimately more fulfilling than other mainstream romantic movies I've seen. So, soundtrack? Fits perfectly with the images of the film; it is good that understated Swedish folk artist Jose Gonzalez continues to churn out those subtle classics that make an overcast day and a hot cup of tea seem close to perfect. Cinematographically, I have to say, the images were positively breathtaking at times; specifically, I am talking about the way way long shots where Mitty is traversing bridges by bike or foot, or when he is trying to reach a volcano and has the Icelandic geography as his backdrop; or the close-ups on Mitty when he realizes the volcano is about to erupt and he cannot understand that the driver of the car is trying to tell him to get in so he can drive them both to safety; I think that might have been a fish-eye lens there, but I am not entirely sure, as the image was only just barely warped. The special effects are really above par, too: such as in the fight sequence between the protagonist and his boss. I know that for many, this sort of thing doesn't count in the evaluation of a film, but I am also a sucker for a decent title sequence and end credits, and the graphic presentation of the titles at first, then the cast and crew at the film's close, are really the kind of thing that makes me go, 'Damn, I've GOT to learn how to DO that!' I think most of all I loved the journey the film took us on, from a place of Mitty's longing for a seemingly out-of-reach coworker on an internet dating site, to a place of dreaming, to a place of self-discovery and making those dreams a reality, to getting the girl in the end. But something about this film probably will not bother you the way stereotypical boy-wants-girl narrative film does, because it really didn't for me.If you are looking for familiar actors in a wholly new setting and under wholly different acting conditions, beautiful image capture, engaging visuals including special effects, some kind of representation of Icelandic culture, some moving statements about art, photography, and journalism (or really any field that blends art and the corporate world), and a better than average soundtrack, then this film is most definitely worth your time.My hat (and I can say this since I wore one today) goes off to Ben Stiller, his cast and crew. I have a renewed interest in narrative romances, so long as they measure up to this one. It actually made me cry as the credits rolled, I was so full of love for TSLOWM.Kudos!",10,1,2,15 April 2014
12 Years a Slave," Unbelievable!
","The eloquent manner with which Steve McQueen conveys the injustice of slavery, a mere microcosm of centuries of endemic cowardice and brutality, can truly only be compared to the emotional depths of Amistad, the acclaimed film from the 1990's. I don't presume to know about slavery beyond what films and novels have provided in terms of storytelling, or beyond the scope of the university classroom; but I cannot imagine a more brutal, cruel intensity than this film manages to grasp for. The story, recorded to be true, follows twelve years in the life of Solomon Northup, a free man from New York state who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Georgia. He is removed from his family, savagely beaten, betrayed, condescended to, and reduced from an educated, prosperous livelihood to one of unspoken nothingness to which his kidnappers and 'masters' have devalued him and forced him to work inhumanely. He witnesses and is forced to participate in the deaths and beatings of many fellow slaves, and is driven to the point of an inner turmoil that, despite Ejiofor's breathtaking portrayal, even the most empathetic of us cannot fully fathom. Eventually, toward the end of his twelve years of forced servitude, he meets a free man from Canada (played by the always refreshing talent, Brad Pitt) who is hired as a paid laborer to work alongside Solomon--or Platt, as he is referred to during those twelve years; upon hearing Solomon's story- -and God knows how Solomon was able to trust anyone after the series of betrayals he fell victim to--this man decides to help liberate him by finding Solomon's friends in the North and having them provide documentation of his freedom. Then one day, one of Solomon's old friends appears to cart him off back home, and does, threatening upon leaving to counter-sue Mr. Northup's now-former 'master' if he tries to claim legal rights to him ever again. This is one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film, although there are many: the resolution with which Northup walks into the carriage to finally accept his rightful freedom, the brief burst of fervor with which his friend stands up for him to show that Epps no longer holds Northup's life in his hands, the despair Patsey expresses watching her friend disappear, all translate to an emotionally charged denouement. Northup cleans up, his hair now graying, arrives home for the first time in twelve years, walks into the front door of his old house where his wife, two children, son-in-law, and grandson who was named after him are all awaiting him to receive a much needed recompense for years spent apart and wondering. The burden of guilt he feels for leaving his family without him for so long is assuaged by his wife, who comforts him by saying that no apology is necessary on his part.Incredible. All the awards this film garnered are fully justified, and I think it deserves even more than it received. Lupita Nyong'o, in her three or four scenes in which she speaks, steals the show effortlessly and with poignancy and grace; everyone can already tell, as evidenced by her Oscar win, that she does not take acting lightly, and has talent and staying power that will keep her career, and our viewing experience, in continuance. Watching Chiwetel Ejiofor in the title role in this film is an emotional roller-coaster, a visual treat, and highly necessary to for the completion of our obviously fragmented understanding of any suffering endured long ago. The stories of slavery are so few and far between, because the unsavory nature of it all, the fact that fellow human beings were capable of such willful ignorance, somehow turns us off to their reality. But I find stories like these (and apparently there were many, though few with equally resolute and 'just' endings) highly necessary to our historical understanding of cruelty and what to do when laws are so driven by greed that the human component is outrightly forgotten. Unfortunately, slavery continues today all over the world, though it has morphed from plantation slavery to sweatshops, illegal sex trades, farm cruelty, and unjust, monopolized corporate work conditions. For many people, slavery is not only a memory passed down by one's ancestors or history books, but a very present reality that still requires legal and philanthropic action in order to change. Watching this film has a bittersweet quality: on the one hand, the United States has come so far, legally speaking, and in terms of racial equality, from the era about which this account was written, nearly 200 years ago; yet, the tragedy, other than that any of this cruelty or suffering had to be endured by anyone at all, is that those whom Solomon eventually prosecuted more or less went unpunished, since a black man was unable to bring a white man to justice in the nation's capital at the time. The beauty is the publicity and acclaim that Northup's story has received since the book's publication, and now, in climax, the film's release and subsequent Oscar attention. It serves as a monument to endurance in the face of extreme adversity, stolen identity, and prolonged despair, as well as to the work which still needs to be done to continually preserve and redefine equality to include all living, breathing, and feeling beings.Let us not forget the amazing gift that Northup has given by sharing his story--not only in using his voice to bring poetic justice to his former 'owners' and further freedom to himself--but because in using art as a medium for conveying his struggle, he has created a chain reaction of concern and insight into the depths of human cowardice and greed among his ever-growing audience.Here's to a life well-lived, and the hope that it was not lived in vain. Thank you for your story, Solomon, and thank you to all who made its portrayal on the big screen possible.",6,0,1,26 April 2014
