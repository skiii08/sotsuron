Conquest 1453," Not good but not that bad neither.. Would be much better of course.
","As a Turk, i admit that, this movie doesn't deserve more than 6 stars. But it doesn't deserve 1 either.Acting, plot, effects are not at their best. Casting is awful. There are more talented Turkish actors for these roles.Scene editing is not good at all. Giovanni Giustiniani and UlubatlÄ± Hasan are both jokes. They are like they run out of the gym to fight in the battle. I think director choice is the starter of the disaster. Faruk Aksoy wasn't capable to direct this kind of movie. If you look his directing carrier there are only low quality comedy and horror movies. *But if you consider that, this is the first trying to do a historical - action movie with this scale in Turkish movie industry, slamming it to the ground is a bit merciless*. I read plenty of reviews. Everybody complains about the nationalist propaganda of turks. I admit that movie doesn't give history as it really was. Of course, citizens of the conquered city wouldn't see the conqueror as a savior. Of course Turks were not that almighty and Christians were evil( Opposite of this is not real either.) But take a second and think.. In Hollywood movies don't we see people with American eyes. Were Persians monsters as seen in 300? Or are Russians, Chinese evil as seen in plenty action movies? Were Indians beasts as seen in western movies? This is not the first time that one nation sublimated and their enemies identified as cowards, heartless puppets.",3,3,7,15 January 2013
American Sniper," Is this the real life?
","No. It's just a fantasy. The worst film so far in those 2-3 years era. A lot of things are wrong with the movie frankly. There is no storyline in the film at all. One patriotic guy is trying to save America from the 'evil' by himself. He saw the news and ta-da became a legend war hero. Clint Eastwood didn't try to show him as a real human being. he has no inner reckoning at all. He is a god as how American community wants to see an American soldier. There are too many secret messages in the movie. They have 'punisher' symbol on their equipments. Who do they punishing? in what cause they are punishing? Here is the answer: He is carrying Holy Bible. So he is punishing the infidels. All Arabians men, women, children are shown as evils. I think casting was done on some purposes. This movie won an Oscar for Sound Editing. What is so special about this movie's sounds. Is it really better from 'Fury' or another movie? or Academy is honoring American propaganda in its own way? This foul movie is trying to show a foul cause as a righteous one. And it is racist in national and religional ways.",2,4,28,27 February 2015
It Chapter Two," CGIwise the Clown will haunt you...
","With early 2000's video game cut-scene quailty CGI effects, second part is not even close to be the shadow of it's predecessor. Acting was above average but CGI is so so bad so you can't get into the movie most of the time. With the jump scare frenzy you start to wait the next one without any excitement or fear. As they say 'nothing lasts forever' this movie's legacy ended quicker than expected. Shame. It's 6/10 because of the peformance of Bill and James.",6,0,0,12 September 2019
Parasite," Good but Overhyped
",All of the watchers can get the idea of the contrast between the families that's for sure. Interesting -not the most interesting- plot works just fine but movie couldn't give me the feeling of emphaty which it tries to give. Rich family was wierd but it doesn't make them the villians. You don't kill people because they don't like your smell and crying in front of the picture of the man you murdered won't be a redemption. Writer tried us to grow sympaty for him but it didn't work for me.This kind of unjustified things pushed me a bit and ending wasn't satisfying that much. Acting and cinematography took credit of my rating. Thanks for reading.,8,2,6,29 August 2019
Son of Saul," Total pain - A quick review.
",Movie is totally painful. First half you feel pain for the victims but after a certain point you start feeling pain for nonsenseness. I tried to feel emphaty with saul but by the movie comes to end it turned some bitter antipathy. If the point was to show his irrationality we can say that it was achived but anyhow it was hard to stand.,4,3,5,8 July 2018
